0,TheLittleSongbird,Beautiful Parisian Extravaganza!,9,5 June 2009,"Moulin Rouge portrays a complicated, passionate and powerful love story, that is also incredibly moving. I am 17, and I thought the film was near-perfect, I mean I loved the overall look of the film with its gorgeous costumes, dazzling choreography and sumptuous cinematography. The script was very poetic, especially when Christian is comparing Satine, the beautiful courtesan to a ""sparkling diamond"", and when Toulouse exclaims ""I hope the piano is tuned"". The songs are wonderful, particularly ""Come What May"" and ""The Show Must Go On"", and everybody in the cast does their own singing, and I honestly didn't know Ewen MacGregor could sing, he has an amazing voice. I have heard too many complaints saying there are too many songs, but do bear in mind it is a musical, and to me, being an aspiring singer, music is like poetry, and very often is the best way to describe your mood. I thought the performances were brilliant. Ewen MacGregor is very earnest and likable as always as Christian, and Nicole Kidman is both fabulously sexy and wonderfully tragic as the consumptive Satine, and the character's death scene was quite heart-rending, and was very reminiscent of the Greta Garbo movie Camille(which I will admit I like more). I also liked the performances of Jim Broadbent as the sympathetic Ziegler and Richard Roxburgh as the wily duke. However there were one or two aspects that were extremely silly, like the hilarious Can Can scene as well as the duet between Ziegler and the Duke, and compared to Jose Ferrer's more poignant portrayal as Toulouse in the 1952 version, John Leguizamo as the character mayn't be to everyone's taste. Overall, a beautiful extravagant film with a 9/10. Bethany Cox",Moulin Rouge!
1,Leofwine_draca,Hate the leads so where do I go?,5,19 September 2021,"I can't stand McGregor or Kidman so I had a hard time with this one. It goes on way too long too. On the plus side, the sheer opulence of the sets and costumes does work to a degree and some of the songs are okay.",Moulin Rouge!
2,SnoopyStyle,Baz Luhrmann extravaganza,7,16 April 2014,It's 1899 Paris. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is an English writer trying to take in Parisian artistic life. He befriends Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). He gets involved with Moulin Rouge star Satine (Nicole Kidman). The club owner Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) has promise her to the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) if he would invest.It's got Baz Luhrmann's grand vision. It's a modern day musical. McGregor and Kidman are surprisingly good as singers. It's still not my taste but it's got the style right. Its excesses are what sells this movie. Anything less would reduce this to no more than musical theater. The story is melodramatic but it is in keeping with the tone of the movie. Even using modern songs as burlesque music seems somehow fitting if somewhat weird.,Moulin Rouge!
3,Hitchcoc,Those French Really Have Fun,9,2 March 2006,"This is a true experience. I was halfway through the movie. I still didn't understand it, but I sat in its lush glow and vivacity. Baz Luhrmann threw together a mass of elements into a soup that will make some people hate it and others love it. For whatever reason, I walked out of the theater exhilarated. First, we have the love story. Satine and her young writer. We know it is doomed from the time she coughs into her handkerchief. Then there is the theatre. It's what we might see something like this in our dreams. Then there are the French painters, mugging and wandering through, stealing scenes. Through in some contemporary music mixed with music created for the film. It's a hodgepodge. I remember a story by Ray Bradbury where a Chinese emperor doesn't want to face reality. I believe it is called ""The Flying Machine."" He stairs at a mechanical toy with artificial birds and flowers. This is like one of those wondrous machines. I don't even know if we can form an emotional attachment for the characters because they are like dolls moving through the amazing numbers and visual delights. I remember trying to tell someone why I liked this, and by the time I finished, I could see that he would not go near this movie. And yet, for some of us, it reels us in and holds us to the very end. Go figure.",Moulin Rouge!
4,classicsoncall,"""Outside it might be raining, but in here it's entertaining!""",9,24 April 2018,"Another reviewer on IMDb describes the picture as a musical for people who don't like musicals. I think I can say that pretty much sums it up for me. I found the movie to be colorful, clever, whimsical, absurd, bawdy and ultimately triumphant. What I wasn't expecting following an introduction of a 1900 Paris setting was the overly anachronistic use of song snippets from a vast array of sources ranging from 'The Sound of Music' to the Beatles, Madonna, Elton John, and U2, with an homage of sorts thrown in to Bowie's Diamond Dogs. It all works to add up to an entertaining couple of hours marked by an explosive use of color that's simply dazzling. If you need to know about the story, it's all about freedom, beauty, truth and love, emphasis on love with an accent provided by entrepreneur Zidler (Jim Broadbent) punching out The Duke (Richard Roxburgh). Prepare to be surprised by actors who can sing, as Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman handle their tunes skillfully as star crossed lovers coming to terms with impending disaster. I'd say more but other reviewers have done so more competently. I'm just surprised by how much I liked this picture, and if you're of a similar frame of mind, I'd offer the advice of the showman ringmaster who said at one point - ""...if you can hunk-hunk, you can hunkadoodle with them"". I couldn't have said it better.",Moulin Rouge!
5,gavin6942,Such Beauty!,8,12 June 2015,"A poet (Ewan McGregor) falls for a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman) whom a jealous duke covets in this stylish musical, with music drawn from familiar 20th century sources.Some people are really hard on Baz Luhrman, and I can understand why. It is easy to fault him for style over substance, or for taking classics like ""Romeo and Juliet"" and twisting them in ways we may not necessarily like. But I am not a detractor of his. Maybe ""Strictly Ballroom"" is not my cup of tea, but this film (""Moulin Rouge!"") is pretty amazing.The colors, the clever re-interpretation of modern music. And some solid casting. Nicole Kidman has a handful of good roles and many others that are completely forgettable. (Probably most actors can say the same thing.) Luckily, this is one of her memorable ones.",Moulin Rouge!
6,lee_eisenberg,"There needs to be a ""Weird Al"" Yankovic version of this.",6,22 March 2006,"""Moulin Rouge!"" was not the sort of movie that I would have nominated for Best Picture in a year when we had ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Memento"" (thankfully, it didn't win). But otherwise, the movie isn't bad. Like another 2001 flick, ""A Knight's Tale"", it uses 20th century popular culture to tell a story that happened a long time ago. Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent do reasonable jobs with their roles, but I personally thought that John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec was the neatest character in the movie. And the ending was a little anti-climactic.Considering that many of the songs used here were once spoofed by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, it seems that they could make a spoof of this movie featuring his versions. I'd pay to see that.",Moulin Rouge!
7,jboothmillard,Moulin Rouge,9,7 March 2005,"I have seen many emotional love stories, I have seen many heart warming musicals, and when the two are combined, you have a magnificent film, from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Baz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet). It is 1899 in Paris, and aspiring young poet Christian (Golden Globe nominated Ewan McGregor) ignores his father's wishes, and joins the colourful, slightly dark underworld of the legendary Moulin Rouge club, run by Harold Zidler (BAFTA winning Jim Broadbent). While he is there, he not only has passion to create new art for the rich audiences of men, along with his friends and co-creators including Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), but he starts a passionate affair with the highest paid star and most famous courtesan, Satine (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Nicole Kidman). Their romance is carried out in the club, but what makes their love a tragedy is the nasty Duke (Richard Roxburgh) saying he will only pay for the show, Spectacular Spectacular if Satine is his, love is forbidden in the Underworld, and more tragic, she is slowly dying of her illness (internal bleeding). The ending is not only a fantastic musical with passionate singing from McGregor and Kidman (well, all their singing is magnificent), but it has the tear-jerking ending with Satine dying in Christian's arms, and he finishes his story about this (he was writing about it). Also starring Garry McDonald as The Doctor, Jacek Koman as The Narcoleptic Argentinean, Matthew Whittet as Satie, The Lord of the Rings' David Wenham as Audrey and Kylie Minogue as The Green Fairy with the voice of Ozzy Osbourne. I think the film is also clever for the period story and characters singing modern love and pop culture songs in int, e.g. ""I Will Always Love You"", ""Love Lifts Us Up"", ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"", ""Lady Marmalade"" (which Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lil Kim, Mya and Missy Elliot adapted fantastically) and of course, the great couple song, the Golden Globe nominated ""Come What May"", which was number 85 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Craig Armstrong and Marius De Vries and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Original Score. Nicole Kidman was 21, and Ewan McGregor number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, McGregor was also number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 25 on 100 Years of Musicals, and it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!",Moulin Rouge!
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Nice Visuals, Terrible & Insulting Script",4,1 November 2006,"Being a fan of the 1952 film, I was pumped to see this, especially after reading a few reviews which raved about it. Wow, what a letdown.Yes, part of the reason I was so disappointed with this was that it bore little resemblance to biography of artist Toulouse-Lautrec which was the centerpiece of the classic film. Later, when I was informed that this movie was not intended to be a re-make but a totally new movie with its own story, I felt a little better and watched the movie again. Sorry, but it still sucked!Oh, the visuals were great, especially in the beginning of the movie. I loved all the color and wild visuals in that first 20 minutes, but that was it. After that, it settled into a frustrating love story and the bogged down drastically the rest of the way.As for the music, there are too many slow numbers sung by mediocre singers like Nicole Kidman and Ethan Hawke, the two romantic interests in the film. They weren't bad singers, but so-so wasn't good enough for a major motion picture production like this.And, being a big fan of Toulouse-Lautrec's artwork and fascinating history, I didn't appreciate him being shown as a clownish transvestite-type character. That was disgusting, and really tells you about this film.As they say, ""too bad; this could have been so much better."" All they needed was an entirely new script.",Moulin Rouge!
9,Tweekums,Camp musical fun from director Baz Luhrmann,9,10 May 2020,"This musical opens in 1900 with Christian, a writer, working on a script based on his own experiences in Paris in the past year. We then move back a year and see his story. He is a young British writer who has moved to Paris to experience the Bohemian lifestyle; particularly that at the titular Moulin Rouge theatre. He starts writing for a group who are preparing a play. When he goes to the Moulin Rouge he is quickly attracted to courtesan Satine. She has been promised to a wealthy duke but following a misunderstanding mistakes Christian for the duke... by the time the truth is revealed she has fallen for Christian. When they are caught together they explain that they were merely rehearsing the play... a story of love that mirrors their situation. The group works to create the play described, all the time trying to keep the duke in the dark. There is another concern Christian is unaware of; Satine is unwell.If you want a feel of late nineteenth century Paris and the music performed there you are likely to be disappointed; the songs are reworkings of modern songs so expect to hear versions of songs from the likes of Queen, Madonna and Bowie. The musical numbers are impressive with huge numbers of extras as well as our central performers. The story may be cliché but it is effective and provides a good reason for the various musical numbers. The cast does a fine job; most obviously Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor as Satine and Christian but also the likes of Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh as theatre owner Howard Zidler and The Duke, amongst others. This certainly won't be for everybody but if you like over-the-top camp it is a lot of fun.",Moulin Rouge!
10,moonspinner55,Hyperkinetic,3,29 July 2002,"Chanteuse in late 1890s Paris mistakes a Bohemian songwriter for a wealthy Duke; they fall in love anyway. Strictly as a piece of eye-candy, ""Moulin Rouge!"" is a stunning cinematic achievement; alas, it is also full of inappropriate music and characters so manic they lose any appeal the actors might have brought to the slim material. It is visually inventive but absolutely devoid of passion, and so mechanically cranked-up to grab you by the eyeballs that it fails to come together on an emotional level. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--everyone in the cast, in fact--is game and energetic to a fault, but after 90 minutes I'd had enough. The film's major conceit (pop and rock songs injected into a period setting) never quite gels, and as for the characters...who cares? *1/2 from ****",Moulin Rouge!
11,blanche-2,I don't know what I was expecting,10,24 August 2009,"...but it sure as hell wasn't this! I loved Luhrman's """"Strictly Ballroom"" but after seeing ""Moulin Rouge,"" the word talent doesn't begin to sum up what this man can do. Absolutely fresh, exciting, colorful, fast, brilliant, fiery, sweet, gorgeous, funny, original - I'm still stunned from the visual impact and the use of the anachronistic music in this film.A total knockout in every way. I recently saw John Leguizamo interviewed. He said that he was scheduled to be in more numbers but - and I'm paraphrasing - Nicole Kidman kept knocking him over or vice versa - he was hilarious.Baz Luhrman pulled some opera elements into this, particularly Traviata - one of the scenes was right out of Traviata, in fact. I'd love to see him do a production of it. It would be phenomenal.The cast was wonderful, with Kidman and McGregor magnificently showcased - beautiful to look at, fine acting, good singing - they made a fantastic couple.I have one itty bitty criticism, but it's not enough to give such an original approach less than a 10. I would have loved some of the musical numbers to have been just a tiny bit slower. I realize today the style is more the fast cuts, but some of it was so beautiful, I would have loved to have lingered on some of the scenes a bit more.A sensational accomplishment. A must see.",Moulin Rouge!
12,Quinoa1984,"well made, if still a spectacle ultimately",6,3 June 2001,"Buz Luhrmann's Moulin Rogue is a good example of a film where having songs in it repeatedly and sung by the cast isn't distracting from the rest of the film (unlike the recent Dancer in the Dark). In fact, considering the frenzied pace, razor sharp camera cuts and settings, songs do this film some good. Moulin Rogue, as we learn was a very big and flashy dancing and practically insane place for really entertaining people (notice the sarcasm). Enter in a dreaming writer (Ewan McGregor) as he soon find that his most important philosophy (I believe in love, he states) is put to a test with the lovely and tempting Satine (Nicole Kidman). Then the usually noticeable convention happens in the story, but that's not what gives this film it's high rating.Luhrmann presents a musical that hasn't really been seen or heard before. He uses a Technicolor film approach, mixed with contemporary songs (some might remember last month's Knight's Tale tried this trick) and 50's dance numbers. It is actually quite a stupendous spectacle once you surpass the flaws. Kudos to the cast, of course, but also to Lurhmann, editor Jill Bilcock, cinematographer Donald McAlphine and production designer Catherine Martin for making such a different piece. By the way, in case anyone is wondering, this is the only film where you will see (originaly it was) Roxanne turned into a Broadway type of production number.",Moulin Rouge!
13,wes-connors,My Bleeding Eyes and Ears,5,4 August 2010,"This is a color-drenched, frantically directed, near-operatic song and dance fest laced with special effects. The plot is thoroughly trounced in the trappings, but it involves handsome songwriter Ewan McGregor (as Christian) falling in love with leggy Nicole Kidman (as Satine), a ""Cabaret"" singer with a ""Camille"" complex. Yes, Ms. Kidman mixes up Liza Minnelli with Greta Garbo. It's set in Paris at the turn of the century (1899/1900), but the soundtrack finds most of its songs in the second half of the 1900s.The justification for the inclusion of ""future"" songs may be found in the lyric ""songs they have sung for a thousand years"" from ""The Sound of Music"". ""Nature Boy"" is the most important tune, making Mr. McGregor's ""enchanted"" character believable. The Beatles' publishing companies were only mildly forthcoming, but Madonna was generous. Elton John's ""Your Song"" is also featured prominently. And, McGregor sings it well. The extravagant DVD package smells nice. But, the film's taste is strictly acquired.***** Moulin Rouge!

14,michaelRokeefe,Truth. Beauty. Freedom. Love!,6,25 March 2003,"Bohemian. Ribald. This costume musical takes place in 1900 Paris. Two men, a young poet(Ewan McGregor) and a Duke(Richard Roxburgh), covet a beautiful chanteuse(Nicole Kidman). Two hours of dizzy break neck music in motion. This movie bears no relation to the many previous films set in the most famous Parisian nightclub, the Moulin Rouge. Miss Kidman is utterly seductive with looks to kill for. And to many a surprise, this fetching actress can actually sing. Two hours of McGregor is another story. Also in this colorful cast:John Leguizano, Jim Broadbent and Caroline O'Connor. Kylie Minogue plays The Green Fairy. Outstanding familiar music covering what seems the entire 20th century.

15,sunwarrior13,A Love-It-Or-Hate-It Experience,9,3 October 2012,"""Moulin Rouge!"" is a romantic Jukebox musical that tells the story of a young, English poet/writer, Christian, who falls in love with the terminally-ill star of the Moulin Rouge, cabaret actress and courtesan Satine. It stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor together with Jim Broadbent,Richard Roxburgh,John Leguizamo,Jacek Koman and Caroline O'Connor.The film was loosely based on the opera Orpheus in the Underworld It was directed, produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann.Christian leaves behind his bourgeois father during the French belle époque of the late 1890's to seek his fortunes in the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Christian meets the absinthe- and alcohol-addicted artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who introduces him to a world of sex, drugs, music, theater, and the scandalous dance known as the cancan, all at the Moulin Rouge, a decadent dance hall, brothel, and theater that's the brainchild of Harold Zidler. Christian also meets and falls into a tragically doomed romance with the courtesan Satine, who becomes the star of the play he's writing, which parallels the couple's romance and utilizes rock music from a century later.This film is a tour de force of artifice, a dazzling pastiche of musical and visual elements at the service of a blatantly artificial story.It is all style, all giddy, over-the-top spectacle but nevertheless, it's also daring in its vision and wildly original.It is overall a ""love-it-or- hate-it experience"" for the viewer.",Moulin Rouge!

17,Theo Robertson,I Hate Musicals,4,22 April 2003,"With the exception of PINK FLOYD`S THE WALL I`ve always hated musicals . It`s the whole camp concept of men and women talking sensibly one moment and springing about like muppets on acid the next . Got your eye on a babe you fancy like mad lads ? Then sing to her and do a little hot shoe shuffle next time you see her boys , she will never forget you in much the same way she`ll never forget being mugged , or finding her previous lover in bed with her best friend You can see the point I`m making can`t you ? Musicals are silly and unrealistic and MOULIN ROUGE is no exception so I don`t really have to say why I disliked this film because it found it more silly and unrealistic than most musicals I`ve seen . I do recognise that there is a fair amount of cheek and temerity involved of having late 20th century pop songs in a film set in Paris in 1900 along with other post modernist anachronisms , and there is much technical worth in the areas of editing , cinematography and costume design , but I found MOULIN ROUGE  to be a cheesy mess and turned off after 40 minutes",Moulin Rouge!
18,preppy-3,Beautiful but annoying,6,18 June 2001,"Christian (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with Santine (Nicole Kidman) at the Moulin Rouge. She loves him too, but she's promised to the evil Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh). What will she do? Who cares? The film looks incredible but has quite a few major problems...virtually the whole movie is shot in extreme quick cuts making it difficult to know what's going on; the film veers wildly from comedy to satire to tragedy without ever finding a comfortable medium between them; it's too long; all the ""songs"" are just snatches of popular songs from the past--it's not cute or clever, just annoying (and confusing); Kidman (a very good actress) gives a very bad performance and that's no depth in any of the characters so it's really hard to give a damn. Also John Leguiziamo gives one of his worst performances (and that's saying something). The movie has just two pluses--the truly stunning visuals and McGregor gives out a very good performance--and what a beautiful singing voice! He ALMOST saves the movie.

19,Boba_Fett1138,Definitely a case of style over substance...but in this case that is no complaint!,8,8 July 2005,"Best way to describe to movie is visual splendor! ""Moulin Rouge!"" is a feast for the eyes and thanks to the use of music also for the ears!To be honest I didn't expected to like this movie as much as I did. I never have been really impressed with director's Baz Luhrmann style. I however love the way he directed this movie. I'm still not a fan of him but I can certainly appreciate his talent more now. He directed this movie with lots of visual splendor and a good pace but also with an eye for the more emotional scene's.The movie is well casted, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are terrific leading actors and a good screen duo and John Leguizamo, Richard Roxburgh and David Wenham are almost unrecognizable! The performances in the movie by the actors are top-class and Kidman and McGregor also are surprising good singing talents.I love the way they mixed the all well known music together and the way they made it blend with the images on the screen.As for the story itself, I found it all terribly predictable but still with the images and music put under it, it is a original movie experience.

20,neil-476,Unique,10,14 August 2011,"The wife dragged me along to Moulin Rouge when it first hit the cinemas. I didn't want to go. It did not appeal to me in the slightest.And then it started with a little bloke with a baton at the front, giving it some wellie as the 20th Century Fox fanfare played. And I was completely hooked.The introductory sequence featured a creepy take on Nature Boy and some dazzling (and funny visuals), and I was so deeply into it that I am still recovering ten years later.This film tells a melodramatic and tragic story set in the Toulouse Lautrec era Moulin Rouge, and does so by mixing and matching a vast array of theatrical, cinematic, musical, visual and storytelling styles. The music is largely contemporary, often with assorted songs cut up and snippets sewn together, and delivered brilliantly by the cast, especially Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor (although I must award bonus points for Jim Broadbent delivering an eye-boggling, but plot-relevant, version of Like A Virgin).The visuals are imaginative and dazzling. Richard Roxburgh is a terrific funny and scary pantomime villain.I remember people walking out of the cinema during the movie, and I can quite understand them doing so - it is not to everyone's taste. But, in its outrageous fusion of elements which should not work together (but which do), it is a unique film of immense bravery. And, best of all, it is highly entertaining.",Moulin Rouge!

Couldn't have anything to do with the ridiculous performances (who else wanted to see John Leguizamo take a long walk off a short pier, and who else but me felt embarrassed for poor Jim Broadbent, terrific in so many other things), Baz Luhrmann's irritating directorial style (his target audience would appear to be 14-year old girls with ADS), or the banal music (""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" a REAL musical, made fun of ""I Will Always Love You."" ""Moulin Rouge"" pays homage to it). This film is vapid eye candy stretched out over an exhausting 2 hours. Congrats, Baz---you've succeeded in inventing a new genre---the feature-length MTV video.

23,anaconda-40658,Beautiful Sadness.,7,10 June 2015,"Moulin Rouge (2001): Dir: Baz Luhrmann / Cast: Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxbergh: Ravishing look at early century Can Can clubs. It is a place that once was but no longer but to one lone poet the laughter and glitter remain. He receives opportunity to write a play for the club but falls in love with Nicole Kidman. She is the star but she suffers from an illness. When the Duke arrives he demands her hand and control of the play. Director Baz Luhrmann miraculously brings back the glamour of old musicals in a style similar to his Romeo and Juliet. He structures the film with club versions of modern pop songs. This is creative and festive but we know where it is heading and that will gnaw on our minds in the meantime. Tremendous job by Kidman who embodies the musical numbers with zest and energy becoming a glow within the dark business of corruption. Great musical entrance has her lowered on a swing and sways swiftly about to the applause of admirers. Ewan McGregor is superb as the love sick poet learns the consequences of falling in love. Unfortunately John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent are featured in flat supporting roles amongst stereotypes, and the Duke is typically cardboard. The ending is depressing but aided by exquisite art direction that brings memories of a once flourishing genre. Score: 7 / 10",Moulin Rouge!
24,phd_travel,Overacting and bad singing,1,13 August 2010,There is hardly anything French about this movie. It is just an exaggerated overacted Ozzie fiasco. Just a couple of borrowed tunes here and there.Ewan can't sing at all. His silly startled look is just plain dumb.The hyperactive slapstick acting through out is tiring and silly to watch.Nicole pre-plastic surgery looks pretty but her overacting is painful.

25,Sylviastel,A Beautiful Visual Feast of Dance & Music!,8,4 October 2015,"The cast all gave terrific performances about the Moulin Rouge nightclub in turn of the century Paris, France. Ewen MacGregor and Nicole Kidman play doomed lovers. Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (""Iris"" supporting actor) and others supply strong performances. The music and dancing is wonderful along with the stunning art direction and costumes. Nicole Kidman won an Oscar for another film in the same year but she is marvelous here. The film was shot in Australia far away from the real Montmartre section of Paris, France. The songs are more familiar and modern despite the setting and time. This film could be adapted for a stage musical. The weakness in this film is with the storyline. I felt there was more attention to the songs and dancing than the script.",Moulin Rouge!
26,JamesHitchcock,The Cinematic Equivalent of a Migraine Attack,3,7 December 2004,"How's this for an original plot? A beautiful but consumptive Parisian courtesan finds true unselfish love with an idealistic young man. I can't think where I've heard that one before. 'Moulin Rouge!' is set in the famous nightclub in 1899/1900. Christian, an aspiring young English writer falls in love with Satine, a courtesan who is also the Moulin Rouge's most famous dancer. (Just how she manages to dance so energetically even though she is dying of consumption is never explained). Christian has a rival for Satine's affections in the shape of an evil but immensely wealthy Duke. Anyone who has read 'La Dame aux Camellias' can work out the rest. The film is not intended to be a period piece or an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of fin-de-siecle Paris. Although the era had its own very distinctive musical culture, some of which is still familiar today thanks to films such as 'Can-Can' or the original 'Moulin Rouge' from the fifties, Baz Luhrmann took the decision to ignore this, using modern pop music instead, so we get the characters singing along to the likes of 'One Day I'll Fly Away', Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' or David Bowie's 'Diamond Dogs'. The idea was presumably to make something unorthodox and to get away from the traditional Hollywood musical. While I can appreciate Luhrmann's ambition to try something unconventional, I did not appreciate the result. Both Nicole Kidman as Satine and Ewan McGregor as Christian did their own singing, but although Kidman's voice is pleasant enough I felt that neither of them have strong enough singing voices to take the leading roles in a film musical. The old system whereby professional singers were often hired to dub the voices of star-name actors had a lot to be said for it. The set-piece choral numbers, by contrast, tended to sound harsh and strident. If the film sounded bad, it looked even worse. The sets and costumes looked cheap and tacky, the colours were garish and the camera-work must have been done by someone on an acid trip. Ditto the editing. The acting is defiantly and quite deliberately over the top, the worst offender being Jim Broadbent whose performance as Harold Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge, must rate as one of the most manic displays of overacting ever seen. Kidman and McGregor are only slightly better; I was left quite unmoved by the pathos of the young lovers' plight. With its strident music, garish colours and hectic visuals, this film is the cinematic equivalent of a migraine attack. Those who see it as a triumph of style over substance are being too charitable. Certainly, there is little substance here, but nobody could call this loud, vulgar, tasteless and self-satisfied film stylish except those who confuse tawdry glitz with style. 3/10. (To those who would say that this is a woman's picture that men cannot appreciate, I would reply that my wife scored it 0/10).",Moulin Rouge!
27,Smells_Like_Cheese,Welcome to the Moulin Rouge!,9,1 February 2008,"I remember when Moulin Rouge came out in 2001, it was the movie that I had refused to see, it just never really did appeal to me. But my mom bought me a three pack DVD of the ""Romantic Tales"", Romeo and Juliet, Ever After, and Moulin Rouge! Now I saw Romeo and Juliet and Ever After, figuring, what the heck? I'll give Moulin Rouge a go, I watched it tonite and I have to say that this film is a thousand times better than what I thought it was going to be. Moulin Rouge is visually spectacular and the music is a lot of fun, the actors looked like they had the time of their lives making this film. This is the musical that are the ultimate must see's, it had the perfect amount of fun, magic, romance, and passion. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman had sizzling chemistry and were just beautiful on the screen together, they brought the Moulin Rouge to life and made it an unforgettable experience.Christian is a struggling poet who comes to Paris to find some inspiration during the revolution. He goes to the deep underworld of theater where poor and rich alike could discover the Moulin Rouge! A fun club starring radiant and beautiful Satine. Satine and Christian have a passionate love affair together and dream of running away together, but Satine is loved by another man, the duke, who could keep the Moulin Rouge alive if she returns the love back. But she's so in love with Christian, they try to keep their relationship quiet, but things become more horrible when Satine finds out about a fatal illness and is struggling to love Christian and try to keep her club jamming.Moulin Rouge the sets, the costumes, the lights, everything about this film is just so much fun to watch. When I first started watching it, I was a little thrown off, I'm sure you will be too, but just keep going with the film, you'll fall in love with it too. Nicole Kidman was just absolutely stunning, she was the perfect choice for Satine. Ewan McGregor had an amazing voice and once again, I don't think there could have been a better choice, I loved their last scene together, it's beautifully acted, well, I'm not going to give it away, just trust me. I recommend Moulin Rouge, it's a fun musical that is guaranteed to give you a good time.9/10",Moulin Rouge!
28,MovieAddict2016,Visually dazzling,7,4 September 2005,"""Moulin Rouge!"" created so much hype in 2001 I'm still surprised I never got around to seeing it. Although Nicole Kidman was already famous, this was one of her first major successes after her split from hubbie Tom Cruise - the fact that it became such a global phenomenon only sparked more tabloid crap - ""Kidman Bigger Than Cruise"" and the likes. This only fueled the popularity of the movie and it became something of a cultural sensation. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing about it.Four years later and the noise has settled. I finally got around to watching the movie on television and left my expectations at the door. As such, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun the movie actually is - visually it's a feast for the eyes, packed with dazzling extravagance. Director Baz Luhrmann (""Romeo + Juliet"") expands upon his directorial flair and theatrics - this comes across as somewhat of a sequel to his Shakespeare remake. (Indeed, the modern soundtrack compliments it nicely.) The story is kind of nostalgic - a worker at France's ""Moulin Rouge"", played by Nicole Kidman, falls in love with a poet (Ewan McGregor). They are not allowed to be together but they cannot resist their feelings for each other.""Moulin Rouge"" isn't a perfect film but the plot is fairly interesting, the characters are likable, the songs are wonderful and visually it's on the scale of a Gilliam film - magical and huge.I would never say it's a ""great"" movie but I would recommend it.",Moulin Rouge!

30,OllieSuave-007,"Colorful, musical and spellbinding!",8,10 June 2014,"I am not a serious fan of musicals, but this movie is one of a few exceptions, a fascinating story where, in 1900 Paris, Poet Christian (Ewan McGregor) falls for beautiful courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), a dancer at the nightclub Moulin Rouge, whose love affair is irked by the jealous Duke (Richard Roxburgh).Though set in 1900, modern era music is incorporated in the film and is spectacular to listen to. The costume and set designs were extremely colorful and vibrant, making the entire stage come to life with the cast of characters' brilliant dance sequences; Kidman especially gave a spellbinding and mesmerizing performance as Satine.The love affair between Christian and Satine is heartfelt and gave the film a nice touch of drama and romance, which I didn't find too sappy at all, just the right amount to touch the hearts of the audience. In addition, the acting of the rest of the cast of characters were unique and passionate, contributing to the music, love, sadness and comic relief genres that surround the entire plot. Director Baz Luhrmann did a good job guiding the cast and incorporating so many dramatic and colorful elements into the movie. Overall, it's an enchanting movie to watch - not your typical romance flick or musical film.Grade B+",Moulin Rouge!
31,sddavis63,This Is What All The Fuss Was About?,4,9 January 2002,"I know that people and critics alike loved this movie. I just can't figure out why!OK. There is a bittersweet love story here - if you can fight your way through the innane first twenty minutes or so. But there's nothing particularly original to it. The high-class prostitute (Nicole Kidman) falls for the poor boy (Ewan McGregor), but has ""responsibilities"" to the more upper-class man in her life. The thing is dull. It's transparent almost from the beginning. We know how this is going to end. Does it have any redeeming qualities? OK - a couple.Good music. Mostly 80's stuff, but some going as far back as the Beatles. Although, I found the 80's music put into the context of a show in 1900 a bit disconcerting. Still, good selection of music. And the movie should be watched if only to see Zidler and the Duke (Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh respectively) do their rendition of Madonna's ""Like A Virgin."" That did have me laughing, I admit. But I really thought that, overall, this was a rather poor attempt to blend a musical comedy with a Greek tragedy.I'm told that the 1944 version was far superior. Perhaps I'll watch that someday.4/10.",Moulin Rouge!
32,ElMaruecan82,Oh La La Land...,8,4 March 2017,"When I was a student, our marketing teacher told us an anecdote about one of our predecessors who, after finishing school, started quite an unusual business; he bought grants for operating licenses, allowing him to improve a brand and its value before selling it with a capital gain. One of his first clients was the owner of a cabaret whose fading reputation made him lose money and customers and needed a real rejuvenation treatment. It was the Moulin Rouge.Legend has it that, once he owned the rights, the secretary of a young Australian director called him, asking for the permission to use the name for the title and the setting of a movie. Needless to say that it boosted the 'Moulin Rouge' image for a whole new century and our young businessman made enough money not to need another job. I don't know how much has been amplified by the passing of years, but I love to think of fate as a crazy Can-Can dancer with a perfect timing; a pivotal business at a pivotal moment of the history of musicals, in fact of movie-making.Wikipedia states that ""Moulin Rouge!"" was the first musical to be nominated for Best Picture after ten years, the last being ""Beauty and the Beast"". While Disney's classic is a great musical, the novelty of its nomination had more to do with its status as an animated movie, so while not disregarding it, I would say that Baz Lurhmann's ""Moulin Rouge!"" is a mini-milestone as the first live-action musical in twenty-two years since Bob Fosse's ""All That Jazz"". When it came out, the ""love-letter-to-Hollywood"" wasn't 'all that jazz' yet, the film took everyone off guard, shook up the conventions of the genre with such gusto that it might have undermined the chances to win the Best Picture Oscar. The more conventional ""Chicago"" would, over such heavy contenders as two epics and a holocaust movie.There wouldn't be one streak of ten years without a musical, but ""Les Miserables"" didn't win the coveted prize and recently front-runner ""La La Land"", was knocked out at the last minute by ""Moonlight"", so maybe the love for musicals have faded a little, and viewers are more attached to conventional forms of storytelling, as long as the stories are unconventional. Maybe that's the problem of musicals: they use unconventional narratives stories that can't wow our cynical eyes. And maybe the reason why I was so ecstatic after ""Chicago"" was because the story was still enjoyable without the music. ""Moulin Rouge!"" uses a clever exclamation mark to distance itself from John Huston's eponymous film and emphasizing its treatment of the iconic place, but beyond all the glitz and extravaganza the film is wrapped in, the story is rather conventional and its notability film is mostly dependent on all the choreographic achievements and frenetic editing.Indeed, ""Moulin Rouge!""' plot can be summed up in one paragraph: a struggling writer named Chrsitian (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with Moulin Rouge's sensation, the courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman) but their romance is undermined by the sneaky mustached Duke of Monroth (Richard Boxborgh). So, they use the process of writing a spectacular spectacle (deliberate pleonasm) as a decoy to their forbidden love but the Duke's jealousy and Satine's illness (she's suffering, actually dying, from tuberculosis) escalates to the obligatory emotional climax. The story is well-acted but its plot is like a clothesline where to hang musical numbers, but that's not to diminish the appeal of the film because it is in a class of its own, on that level and one's got to hand it to Lurhmann to have opened the streak of musicals with possibly the least conventional one.Lurhmann was the son of a dance choreographer and theater owner and like Bob Fosse who was a dancer; you can tell that it injected a real musical instinct in the young director. The film is a dazzling and vertiginous series of musical vignettes directed by a majestic ringmaster played by Jim Broadbent in an unprecedented role since Joel Grey in ""Cabaret"". There's not a single shot lasting more than ten seconds. It is a spectacle that paradoxically endorses the codes of musicals as tragic romances but that invent something that appeal to the MTV and clip generation. The result is odd and avant-garde and might disorient the fans of the more traditional form of storytelling. But don't get it wrong, this is not the kind of musical that would have looked better in Broadway, if anything, it highlights the status of movies as a unique way of storytelling.Indeed, you can't have such dramatic changes of costumes, such heavy jump cuts in a play, but here, they're indispensable for the film's hyperbolic vitality. The editing of is one of the most rhythmically fact you'll ever witness but it's a double-edge sword. The paradox is that the film might not hold up in theaters, many users said they left the audience because they've had an overdose so maybe this is a film that benefit from a viewing, one where you have a remote control. Still, if you're patient enough to get to the end, you will see that the film is not without a strong emotional resonance. Maybe that wouldn't have been possible had it featured traditional can-cans and a gloomier Toulouse-Lautrec (unlike Leguizamo's) but it couldn't be just a retread of the Paris we know.Believe me, as someone who lived in Paris and not far from the Pigalle quarter where the cabaret is set, I knew there was an eternal gap between the Paris you imagine and the real one, Paris is never as dazzling as in the realm of our imagination and what can be more imaginative than a medley of songs that go from ""Queen"" to Kurt Cobain in Paris' 1900. It's crazy, sick irreverent and grotesque but hey, for the sake of entertainment no holds are to be barred.",Moulin Rouge!
33,paul2001sw-1,Mad world,8,21 November 2004,"Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo + Juliet' was a brilliant blend of Shakespeare and a decidedly modern sensibility. 'Moulin Rouge!', that film's successor, is a less-grounded and rather more self-indulgent affair, a voracious monster that gobbles up just about every influence it can lay its hands and spits them out as a spectacle of sound and noise so overwhelming that at times it seems that the screen can barely contain it. Luhrmann's interweaving of fragmented images and songs is dizzying and dazzling and very self-aware, delighting in its deliberate anachronisms. The editing is perhaps the most manic yet seen in cinema, which sometimes supports but at other time smothers some the film's nicest tricks, like the deft choreography (and not just in the dance numbers) that were one of the pleasures of 'Romeo + Juliet'. One could hardly call it monotone, but one can almost for just a little bit of metaphorical black-and-white to offset the extravagant colour.Ewan MacGregor does his usual stuff, Nicole Kidman is excellent in the most demanding role and I also enjoyed the relatively understated performance of Richard Roxburgh as the malevolent Duke. The plot resembles that of 'Shakespeare in Love' (which of course was also based on Romeo and Juliet), and also contains a definite nod to 'Strictly Ballroom', Luhrman's breakthrough feature. There are also no original songs, the joke lies the way that the familiar is recycled into something shiny and new (and if you've seen the film, you'll get the allusion in that last sentence). Yet the fact the soul of the film is so well reflected in pop songs also indicates a certain level of triteness. For all its pomp and magnificence, when the hero and heroine sum up their tale in a simple chorus, you're left with the feeling that there really hasn't been anything deeper than this at any point in the movie.You can file this film along with 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut' as a modern attempt at revitalising the big screen musical. 'Moulin Rouge' is certainly amazing; but the fact that you're unlikely to see another film like it is probably something of which you'll be glad.",Moulin Rouge!
34,bowmanblue,Spectacular! Spectacular!,9,3 July 2018,"I know it's a terribly stereotypical thing to say, but many guys prefer cyborgs smashing into each other and car chases through Tokyo over a musical about the 'merits of love.' I am definitely the former. In fact, most of the titles in my DVD collection ends with the phrase '...of the Living Dead.' However - and it's a BIG 'however' - I will make a massive exception for 'Moulin Rouge.'I'm certainly not a fan of musicals in general (and I'm sure 'South Park: The Movie' doesn't count as one, despite having plenty of songs contained within), so I'm not sure why I love 'Moulin Rouge' so much. It's set a hundred years or so ago in Paris when a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman) in the - kind of infamous - nightclub, the Moulin Rouge. Naturally, true love never runs smooth and the pair have plenty of highs and lows along the way.I suppose it helps that I'm a fan of Ewan McGregor (who can sing probably better than you imagine!) and, possibly what aided this musicals place in my heart was the fact that all the songs they sing are actually 'modern day' songs which work surprisingly well for what is - effectively - a 'period piece.' Nicole Kidman also deserves a nod for her singing voice, although I'm not a massive fan, but she did everything she had to well enough. Although, the two definitely do have chemistry, even leading to rumours of being 'more than just friends' off-screen, too!Although however much you like or dislike the film's leads, what often gets talked about more than who's in the production is the way it's directed. It truly is a film student's dream to watch. Baz Luhrmann does a fantastic (and most of all creative!) job at bringing this old tale to life and injecting more energy than Renton every experienced from 'jabbing a vein' in 'Trainspotting.' The songs/dances are the true definition of 'high energy' and the whole film is awash with vibrant colours and glamour.The supporting cast are also good: John Leguizamo does well for a 'normal-size' man playing a dwarf and therefore acting (and dancing!) on his knees. Jim Broadbent always stood out for me and definitely deserves a nod. The film's primary antagonist is Richard Roxburgh, who, in my opinion, is delightfully campy as the villain. However, I did hear that he took a lot of criticism for his performance and some saw him as the film's 'weakest point.' I guess he does chew up the scenery in some places, but in a film so over-the-top as this, I couldn't really tell the difference.Overall, there's nothing really new here in terms of storytelling. After all... the 'boy meets girl' story is a tale as old as time. However, it's not the story that stands out, but HOW it's told. You definitely don't have to be a fan of musicals to appreciate the volume of energy and love that's gone into making this. It really is a spectacle to observe.",Moulin Rouge!
35,MLDinTN,This was great,10,20 July 2002,"I loved this movie. I wish I  would have know it was so good, and I would have saw this at the theater. I normally don't like musicals, so I wasn't expecting much. The very beginning was confusing, but once they got to the Moulin Rouge, it started getting good. The story was great. For those that didn't like this, how about paying attention and you might change your mind. This isn't just some MTV video. It had a great love story with a sad ending. The use of the all the pop songs added to the story and were even funny like the ""Like a Virgin"" number. Both lead actors were great. I was surprised Nicole Kidman didn't win the oscar. And Ewan McGregor should have been nominated. Both sang well also.
(SPOILERS): My favorite part is when Christen is in Satine's room to give his poetry reading and she thinks he is the duke. Satine keeps talking about the ""naughty words"" and carrying on like that. That was so funny, I couldn't stop laughing.  Then, I loved the ""Your Song"" number and the ""Spectular, Spectular"" song and dance that came shortly thereafter.

Remember Riverdance and Lord Of The Dance and how everyone thot it was so cool at the time? The same applies to this movie. And the story is up to very little indeed, in fact it is like Grease mixed with Luhrmann's version of R+J. Very weak and totally unoriginal.A movie is a movie and musicals are musicals. Plain and simple. Any attempt to merge the 2 have never been met with successful results in my opinion. If you want ironclad proof just take a look at Bollywood. This should have seriously just been a Broadway hit and not a big screen hit. But, of course, if every critic and every woman who sees this with all over her girlfriends like it and if they rave about how good it is because everyone else says it is great and they only went to see it because people are telling them that it is a great movie (fact!) then they are only going to watch the great movie that it everyone says that it is. Me? I just watch the movie for what it is. No bias or pre-movie opinions. And what I saw was a stinker.Almost everything in this movie seems so forced and shoved in our faces. Every shot is cluttered with overly decorated sets, too many occurrences and detail to register with us in 2 seconds cuts (I ain't seeing it twice if that's the idea), heinous ADR that is about as unconvincing as Orson Welles masquerading as Mickey Mouse, VERY bad CGI that Luhrmann seems to be in love with and too many androgynous and weird looking characters.This film is all visual, or, if I were unoriginal (like the movie) I would say all style and no substance. Take away the indulgent and increasingly annoying sets/backdrops and all the jumping around and dancing and you are left withwhat? A tedious movie that is good only because people say it is good. Another victim of `Insider Syndrome'. For me, every set in a movie should, at the same time, be realistic and reflect tone and mood of the scene. EVERY-SINGLE-SET in Moulin Rouge is overly-decorated to the point that we cannot tell what the set is. They are and eyesore, ugly to look at and extremely garish. A representation of everything this movie stands for: indulgence, ego, campiness and pointless extravagance. Lowest markssorry.Oh and one last thinghow come no one speaks French in France?",Moulin Rouge!

Luhrmann is a clueless hack better suited to making MTV videos than a feature film. This is the perfect film for those suffering from attention deficit disorder.

45,Dr_Coulardeau,Amazingly dazzling and mesmerizing,10,22 April 2008,"The subject is banal : Paris, 1900, the famous Moulin Rouge music-hall and their never-ending shows that are titillating and mysterious, fascinating and prodigious. Love above everything else, romantic love with its passion, the little thing deep down inside, dramatic love of course, melodramatic even. The actress of such a show is supposed to finance the show, and the work of everyone else, by providing the patrons, the generous financiers with some carnal pleasure, illusionary or real according to the desires and potencies of these rich even if rather aging males. The melodrama is reached when the actress is dying of consumption. The red of blood is mixing with the green of absinthe. But that is without taking into account Nicole Kidman who transforms that baroque and rococo tall tale of love and prostitution into what it is supposed to be, a blinding explosion of colors and fire, lights and flames. And she can keep the tears on the stage exclusively and prevent the audience from watering the succulent plants in the lobby of the movie theater. Then we are dazed by the brilliant dances, the mesmerizing music, the fascinating songs, the nostalgically innovative melodies, the special effects that are exploding everywhere and transforming a plain stage or a plain screen into some kind of cosmic big bang on the retinas of our eyes, not to speak of the eardrums of our ears. More brilliant than that you die. And Nicole Kidman, or Satine if you prefer, can die on the stage in the arms of her beloved author who is crying so much and so loud that we do not even need to do the same. And then the whole world can fall apart and we can jump into an elliptic flash forward and projects our asses from the flash back of the recollection back into the future when this Christian is reminiscing the thunderous passion of theirs and the flashes of craziness that went along with it.

46,johnnyboyz,You don't have to like musical's to bear this film,6,26 October 2005,"As watching this film was part of my university film course, it became compulsive viewing even though I would normally steer MILES clear of ANY film even mentioned within a breath of the musicals genre. I wasn't expecting anything fantastic and went in with the lowest of lowest expectations, I think this film did pretty well considering that factor. The visuals are pretty stunning. The amount of colour and energy you are drowned in is quite spectacular although this is partly down to Baz Luhrmann's way of doing films, namely with the fast edits he uses. The settings and clothes used were pretty good and even more so when viewing it on 'the big screen' as I saw it in a proper viewing theatre - a feeling I'm told isn't as much present when viewed on the small screen. Although the music itself feels very out of place with characters breaking into chorus' of 'Your Song' and 'Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend' on the verge of the 20th century, it doesn't distract TOO much from the rest of the film, in fact if anything it makes it a tiny bit stronger. One thing that is quite perplexing about the film is the fact that the main character or, in actual fact actor, can sing and sing very well. The songs (all be them modern when compared to the set era) are sung with such grace and passion, it makes you just sit and stare and the activity on screen and in a REALLY odd way, you actually become more aware of the lyrics and how beautiful the song can actually be.In terms of narrative, there's nothing too spectacular. It's the classic love triangle and very reminiscent to that of the situation faced in another musical: 'The Phantom of the Opera (2004)'. The story gets rather stuck. It tries to go up a gear now and again with the Heroine's 'black out' problems and 'the Duke' character getting involved with the Moulin Rouge set up in a certain way but everything seems too planned and too forced for it to flow in a seamless way and for it to be of a level of entertainment that I'd usually enjoy. Still, with plenty of colour and energy and strong acting performances, both in the singing and general acting department this is a pretty enjoyable film that you'll like if you're into your romantic, period dramas with a musical flavour. Even if you're not, you'll enjoy it for its energy",Moulin Rouge!

The Moulin Rouge is a cabaret, one of the most famous in the city, and it still exists, but this film shows its golden age, when the choristers were also prostitutes or ""suggar-babies"" of the elite. The script is based on a triangle of love, sensuality and interest formed by the chorus singer Satine, the powerful Duke and the romantic Christian, an English writer who falls in love with her.This film has a beautiful tragic love story to tell, and that was what I liked most here. The best scenes in the film are the most romantic and the final part. Nicole Kidman looks wonderful, knows how to be sexy without being vulgar, and has very good chemistry with Ewan McGregor, who is another great actor in great shape here. The film was good for both their careers and they both earned all the credit they got. In the supporting cast, Richard Roxburgh and Jim Broadbent deserve an applause for their good work.The problem with this film is, basically, everything else. Instead of focusing on history, creating a romantic drama with tragic contours, the dazzle of Paris was stronger and decided on a Broadway-style musical. This can be pleasant, in other films, when it is done properly. ""Les Misérables"" or ""Sweeny Todd"" are good examples of films of this style that worked wonderfully. Here, the Broadway style and the comic touches came totally out of the question and only served to distract us. Of course, in the middle of the error there are good things. For example, the songs were excellent (Your Song is particularly striking) and so was the music. The entire choreography and dance department of the film deserved to be congratulated for the excellent work, at the level of the best that is done on Broadway. I just think that the film, due to the good love story it brings, did not ask for this cheerful style, especially if we take into account the tragic touch it has. I didn't like John Leguizamo either. He looked like a clown all the time.The film was well directed by Baz Luhrmann, but the film may not be as good as other films of his career, like ""Gatsby"", which was one of the best films he directed, in my opinion. Here, I think he was too bold and followed a path that he shouldn't have followed. But despite that, the film has quality and is worth the time we spent watching it.",Moulin Rouge!
48,Tweetienator,Paris At Its Best,10,3 March 2018,"Nicole Kidman as Satine is a true goddess and Moulin Rouge! is one of the few true outstanding stars in the heavens of musicals. A new giant on the horizon like Tom Hoopers fantastic musical adaption of Les Misérables in 2012 (also strongly recommended).Moulin Rouge! is one great joyride from true love, to the deep fall of life's sometimes most tragic moments.

49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A classic love story flourishing beneath an odd and flamboyant spectacle,8,12 October 2009,"If there was an ultimate and absolute antonym for ""Moulin Rouge!"" it would be the adjective ""shy."" Hundreds of gorgeous costumes, lavish studio sets, a digitally reproduced city of Paris and an abrupt and cartoonish comedic style make this movie musical a one-of-a-kind spectacle.From the very first musical mash-up number in the Moulin Rouge club that consists of around five songs, two of which are Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend,"" you get a sense that ""Moulin Rouge!"" wants desperately to be different and ultimately unforgettable. The initial gut reaction to the film's camp and genre- butchering is to dismiss it as forced and unnatural, but once the recycled albeit powerful love story takes over, the derring-do of Baz Luhrmann's visually striking show becomes much more easily appreciated.Despite a mix of songs that defies the historical context, ""Moulin Rouge!"" takes place in turn-of-the-century Paris in the ""underground,"" inspired by the paintings of Toulouse- Lautrec of the burlesque dancers, courtesans and Absinthe-drinkers. Christian (McGregor) is a hopeless romantic poet whose talent earns him a shot to convince the most famous dancer/performer/courtesan, Satine (Kidman), and her manager/pimp, Harold Zidler (Broadbent) at the city's most famous club, the Moulin Rouge, to let him create the show that will turn Satine into a star. At the same time, a wealthy Duke (Roxburgh) is funding the show and one of his conditions is for Satine to be his.""Moulin Rouge!"" is also not shy about love or letting you know its themes are love and everything to do with love and that it's all that matters in life. If not for Kidman's wonderful performance as a morally conflicted woman dealing with masculine pressures and discovering love is indeed possible, one could make the case that the focal relationship between her and Christian around which the rest of the film blooms might never have even begun to ripen. Christian, after all, is a one-dimensional character seeing as he's motivated only by Satine and true love -- he has no other desires. So as Satine falls for him and his incredible ability to steal the material of famous songwriters decades after his lifetime and perform it with a soaring tenor, something must ground the film, and her very real issues, which are inspired by a combination of famous story lines including ""La Boheme"" and ""La Traviata,"" do the trick.Then there's Luhrmann's (1996's ""Romeo + Juliet"") influences on the film. As it progresses, we begin to love his work here more and more. As the plot thickens and turns for the dramatic (and convincingly so despite so much early antics), his lightning-fast editing choices and lighting become even more effective and the musical numbers being fashioned out of a wide array of songs (like Sting's ""Roxanne"" mixed with original tango music) become all the more impressive.Sweeping zoom-ins of a city done all by computer and music numbers that are shot and choreographed in an all too showtune-y manner go from questionable choices to beautiful ones as Luhrmann's twist on a classic love story archetypes matures before our eyes and the true spirit of his film becomes clearer. There are still some goofy elements that don't fit, but the spontaneity of song and its often times non-traditional use is one of the biggest things to make sense and fit Luhrmann's vision with time.Despite only one original song in ""Come What May,"" (which should have been allowed to contend for an Oscar) it's more the placement of the songs, the way they follow traditional musical theater rules for song placement -- either setting the mood and foreshadowing the story or expounding on the characters' inner feelings at appropriate times -- makes them so effective. Similar can be said of ""Moulin Rouge!"" on the whole: though there's an inherent abruptness, randomness and even a faux quality to much of the film, it keeps the traditional love story at its core and everything else is merely growing bountifully from it. There's a reason the same kinds of love stories get recycled in the theater and movies and simply get dressed up a different way and it's because those stories work; they appeal to something human. So as flamboyant and absurd as this movie gets, it never goes wrong because it sticks to its universal storytelling ideas. ~Steven C",Moulin Rouge!

51,Anonymous_Maxine,Moulin Rouge is a shockingly creative and fascinating film about an original love story.,9,6 August 2002,"A film like this could VERY easily have been great, or at least much greater than it was. Consider what would have happened had they put in the time to come up with an original score that fit with the astronomical level of creativity and imagination that saturates every other element of the film - it may very well have been something as memorable as The Wizard of Oz or some of the truly great scores from film history, such as the Indiana Jones music or the Star Wars theme or any number of other great film soundtracks. But unfortunately, they decided instead to punctuate this incredible and beautiful film with covers of modern popular songs which have no business being in the movie in the first place. First of all, before I begin to complain, I should mention that it is a testament to the quality of the film when something like this is unfortunately thrown in, yet the film as a whole manages to remain a wonderful cinematic experience, it's just too bad that there was so little effort put into such a pivotal thing as the score (especially in a musical romance like this), which could have put the movie over the threshold into the realm of the truly great films. Again, I would like to point out that the performances of the songs were beautiful and wonderfully entertaining, as well as brilliantly choreographed, but even this amazing presentation does not make up for the almost complete lack of any original musical content. There are a few original songs in the movie, but it's the modern ones that are not only unoriginal, but completely disruptive to the rest of the movie. The story deals with an out of work writer in the year 1900 who goes to Paris to write his masterpiece and find true love. Once there, he finds himself stalled by writer's block, but soon finds himself whirled through a dizzying sequence of events that inadvertently send him on the way to accomplish the very goal that he set out for, although not in exactly the way that he had anticipated. This is where the originality comes in, as we are presented with a fascinating although initially superficial romantic plot which is enormously exaggerated but not beyond belief even for a moment. The Parisian night life that we are presented with is huge and glittery and rich and loud, and we are so enraptured by it that we don't doubt for a minute that this is exactly what the night life was like at the Moulin Rouge in 1900. However, this brilliant story is also exactly where the movie begins to falter. True, this is almost surely a vastly exaggerated account of what nights were really like at the Moulin Rouge during this time, but it's so well presented that it is remarkably easy to believe. Unfortunately, we are periodically confused by performances of popular modern songs. Now, I can't say that I was altogether disappointed with all of these performances. Indeed, many of them were genuinely entertaining and well done (although I almost had to leave the room when The Police's `Roxanne' was belligerently performed), but they feel like speed bumps in the film. This is such an enjoyable and convincing film that it's horribly disappointing that they decided to throw songs like `Smells Like Teen Spirit' and that Whitney Houston song into the mix, almost mocking the audience for trying to enjoy the turn-of-the-century world that's presented. Moulin Rouge is something of a strange phenomenon, then, because it is a truly great film that was brought down by the childish addition of modern music. There is no fathomable reason that a film that takes place in 1900 should contain these songs, even though they were quite often well done. It was interesting to learn that both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have wonderful singing voices, but the presentation of modern music does nothing but remove the audience from the world that we have been drawn into and remind us that we are watching a movie, and a movie that's trying to make a bad joke, at that. There is no mystery as to why Moulin Rouge was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2001, but there is also no mystery as to why it didn't win that Oscar (and there is even LESS mystery on that subject when you've seen the other nominees, particularly A Beautiful Mind, the earth-quakingly good winner).  Moulin Rouge in inarguably one of the best films released in 2001, but it was sadly held down by its soundtrack. It should be noted, however, that the music in the film was beautifully done and that the performances were for the most part nearly as good as the rest of the film, but they are so incongruous with the content of the film that they can only count against it. A musical romance is so centered on the music in the film that if the music doesn't work for it, the film as a whole suffers, and it's too bad because Moulin Rouge could easily have fit in as one of cinematic history's truly groundbreaking and memorable films.",Moulin Rouge!
52,Vartiainen,Music! Dance! Costumes! Melodrama!,8,22 January 2016,"A young Scottish author (Ewan McGregor) moves to Paris right before the turn of the century to join the Bohemian movement. He's there to write about love, the only problem being that he's never been in love. Luckily, a group of actors recruit him as their new writer and he gets to meet Satine (Nicole Kidman), the Sparkling Diamond of the infamous Moulin Rouge cabaret. Unfortunately, the budding attraction between these two is bad for business as a very wealthy Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is also interested in Satine's, ahem, satins.What Moulin Rouge! does better than pretty much any other film I've ever seen is spectacle. Everything this movie does is gargantuan. Everyone is acting, emoting, always moving, but always in-character. These people are writers, can-can dancers, courtesans, low-life actors. It makes sense that their whole life is one humongous act where it makes perfect, logic sense for someone to burst into a song right out of nowhere. I especially love the scene where the Duke is about to discover the plot, but everyone, without even knowing one another, is able to pull the wool over his eyes with a quickly spun yarn conveyed through glances and fast-talking. That's how in tune with one another these people are.McGregor and Kidman are also very good in their roles and have some genuine chemistry. Sure it's drowned in cheese, it takes them about five minutes to fall in love and the romance is mainly there to be the romance. I don't really think they really get to know one another. But sometimes that can be forgiven if the movie can pull of the mood and the style correctly. And Moulin Rouge! definitely does.The production values are also amazing. The costumes, the music, the whole grandeur. It's also shot with a very distinctive style from the actual curtain opening start to the faded browns of Christian's sorrow to the lusciously vibrant colours of the cabaret. A film many people see solely for the visuals. They're that good.And yeah, it has its flaws. Its many, many, many flaws. The editing is way too fast, making you unable to focus on anything, especially in the beginning until you get used to it. Though, to the film's credit, it slows down a bit after a while. The story is kind of clichéd and the ending twist is rather uncomfortable from the characters' point of view if you think about it too much. Roxburgh's Duke is also completely over the top, so much so that he would stand out in a children's morning cartoon. It's very much intentional and kind of fits in the whole mood of the film, but he's still something of an oddity among the character cast.But, Moulin Rouge! is one of those guilty pleasure movies where you really don't want to change any of the flaws (with the exception of editing speed in my case) because to change them would be to take something away from the experience. It's definitely not for anyone, but personally I appreciate it for what it is and will definitely pop it in everyone now and then for the rest of my life. Just because it is such a unique piece.",Moulin Rouge!
53,lisafordeay,I hate to say it but the WORST musical EVER MADE that's too overrated,1,18 May 2013,"<<< Spoilers ahead>>>GOD do I hate Moulin Rouge,why well here is why? The story is set in Paris as a man played by Ewan McGregor falls in love with Satine played by Nicole Kidman(who I swear must be related to Amy Adams I always think there alike)who is a duchess and is hiding a terrible secret(oh and you will be SHOCKED to find out what it is once we're finished)and is caught in some sort of love triangle with another guy. So McGregor's charcther poses as a duke so that he can be close to Satine. They sing songs that we ALL know by heart including all you need is love,a bunch of melodies and the nice song Come What May which was a very good original song. But my only problem with this film is the actual ending and(actually) the WHOLE THING. The songs come out of nowhere,the story is so thin,the effects are good though,but I just don't buy into it for a reason. Also like I said before the ending was so depressing and a bit of a letdown,I mean they KILLED of Nicole Kidman's charcther with a lung disease what the HELL,and we were made to believe that McGregor's charcther and Kidman's charcther were going to live happily ever after after the showcase with their song ""Come What May"" in the end and before Kidman died,we were made to believe that she was going to be shot and then all of a sudden she just couldn't stop breathing and she fell off in a weakness and died peacefully in McGregor's arms in the end. SERIOUSLY!?!?! what the hell were they thinking of DOING THAT to the audience.The whole movie is just a joke and a piece of utter and complete garbage. The script is horrendous,the acting sucks,the music sucks,EVERYTHING sucks in this movie. I guess me and Doug Walker from the Nostalgia Critic aren't its cup of tea.My advice go out and rent something that's not bad like if you really love musicals go ahead and watch that timeless classic Grease at least that was good and had its OWN original songs compare to this piece of crap.1/10",Moulin Rouge!
54,FiendishDramaturgy,"Beautiful, Tragic, and Entertaining, If Somewhat Overdone.",8,9 March 2007,"This production received SO much press and promotion that I almost passed on seeing it.

There are several scenes in which the characters look directly into the camera and pop off their one liner. It works well here, though.While this work is replete with clichés and the dialog is particularly trite in spots, the production itself is really quite lovely.

I hated it, especially during its first half. This was a film that seemed like everyone involved was given a bucket of cocaine due to the hectic editing, quick camera work and over-the-top performance. I know that was the point but it didn't mean I have to like it.

56,dfranzen70,Unhealthy pastiche of screaming debauchery,3,16 January 2002,"This overstated hodge-podge of debauchery is neither fascinating nor entertaining. Like director Baz Luhrmann's earlier Romeo and Juliet, this one leans very heavily on style. And when one leans heavily on something with little substance, one falls firmly on one's face. Which is what this unfortunate movie does.It tries hard not to be dull and boring, and in doing so eschews any semblance of nuance. Everyone and everything in this movie is loud, boisterous, screaming to be heard about the maddening din. Sure, this might be 1900 Paris, but if it was, I bet they had a run on Excedrin the following morning - if there ever were following mornings. I don't doubt people were as debaucherous as this; they surely are now in some circles.
A naive young writer (Ewan Macgregor) enters the world of the artists in Paris at the turn of the 20th century and quickly falls in love with an alluring chanteuse (Nicole Kidman). That's great. A love story is fine. But sadly, Macgregor and Kidman have less romantic chemistry than a can a tuna and an angry kitty cat. Each is a respectable thespian in his or her own right, but such talent is completely overwhelmed by the roar of the madness. Kidman can be very effective in much quieter roles, such as Dead Calm, Malice, and To Die For, but really most anyone could have played this particular role (provided they were tall and had 7-foot legs). Macgregor's been in some good films, both small (Trainspotting) and large (Star Wars Episode 1). Both would have been much better off passing up on this junk.The original was an inspired musical featuring some fine tunes. This one is a mish mash of pop hits from the 1970s to the present, often sung at inopportune, inexplicable times (and sometimes not even in the song's entirety). There's plenty of visual goings-on, however, for the viewer to forget the music sucks. Admittedly, the cinematography is superb, eliciting images upon images; there really is some magician behind the camera for this one. But rather than being a masterpiece in and of itself, the camera artwork merely overwhelms everything else about the movie. If I wanted to do nothing but see compelling images, I'd go to an art house and gaze at Monet for a few hours. Or, in the case of this flop, Peter Max or perhaps early Andy Warhol.",Moulin Rouge!
57,PWNYCNY,Movie as theater; an innovative and spectacular production.,10,28 April 2014,"This is an amazing movie. This is the case because it is a musical that is shot in film noir style. The movie is shot entirely in a studio, the cinematography employs all kinds of camera angles to set the mood, the story itself is highly theatrical and melodramatic and set in an underworld characterized by vice and corruption, and features a femme fatale who changes a man's life forever. Nicole Kidman's performance is remarkable. Not known as a singer and dancer, in this movie she sings, dances and plays the ultimate femme fatale. Kidman is proof that when provided the opportunity, Hollywood actors can excel. But what makes this movie unique is the way it was made. The director, Baz Luhrmann, decided to forego the conventional approach in favor of something innovative. This involved the superimposition of contemporary music onto a story set one hundred years earlier. To successfully pull off that kind of juggling act requires a huge amount of skill and Luhrmann succeeds. Not only does the mix work, it results in a story that is engaging, dynamic, and above all, honest. The movie is theater and presents itself as such, thus the audience is not misled. The movie succeeds in achieving a level of emotional intensity that is almost uncanny, considering the nature of the plot. This story is set entirely in a theater. The characters are actors being played by actors and the whole production risks becoming just another silly contrived piece of noise. But that does not happen here. Instead what Luhrmann produces is a masterpiece of drama shrouded in music and dealing with themes that can resonate with any audience.",Moulin Rouge!

This has to be one of the most beautifully photographed films of all time. I am sure that this musical gem of a film will dance away with Best Art Direction & Cinematography Academy Awards. Nicole Kidman stars as the prostitiute-showgirl of Moulin Rouge. Ewan Mcgregor co-stars as the gullible writer in search of love & freedom at the Moulin Rouge. The film is about their love, song, and dance at the Moulin Rouge. The high notes of the film (and there are many) are the illuminating, colorful, and energetic musical sequences. The low notes, if any, are the way too many appearances of the ruthless duke who derails from the beauty of the film. Kidman should `cruise' (sorry nic) her way to a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Mcgregor was far out with his performance. Co-stars John Leguizamo & Jim Broadbent eccentric acting should be recognized at oscar time.

59,CubsandCulture,"20 years after release, the film is still trashy chic.",10,10 February 2021,"Undeniably shallow, loud and a little campy, this wonderful postmodern jukebox musical still manages to carry off its bizarre magical act. This bricolage of tropes, songs out of context, a dash of history and self-awareness is if nothing else is memorable. It is all so vivid, Bohemian and with its own beauty, freedom, truth and yes even a little bit of love.We live in the trash pile of culture, here when the world is so very old, and this film manages to acknowledge that brute happenstance. And yet the experience is fresh and alive. I can understand why someone would dislike this film. The first hour or so is very frantic. It takes awhile to get use to rhythm of proceedings. The technical aspects straddle the line between being ironically tawdry and being unintentionally tacky. The art direction is garish but with an odd beauty to it; there is twinge of grace to it. It is just delicate enough to be a fantasiaWhile the performances are uniformly good, Broadbent as Zidler is the character that stays with me. Broadbent manages to be larger than life, crass but not cruel, fatherly not domineering. The Duke is the heavy in this film but in a more realist version of the story Zidler would be an antagonist as well. It is a testament to Broadbent that the character remains lovable throughout.",Moulin Rouge!
60,Chris_Docker,By the original songs - they are better value,5,26 September 2001,"After two brilliant movies (Strictly Ballroom and Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet), Baz Luhrmann falls prey to overconfidence and over-funding in this spectacular but empty re-working of the Moulin Rouge brothel-come-cabaret-club historical icon. The tale (what there is of it - lowly writer gets off with top-notch courtesan by being mistaken for a duke) is told using modern pop song lyrics, frequently taken out of the song and used as dialogue. ""It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside"" quips Ewan McGregor as he woos Nicole Kidman - not surprising, mate, anyone would feel a bit funny trying to make a whole movie out of lines from pop songs. According to the Director, this is the ""contract with the audience"", as was the dancing in Strictly Ballroom or the Shakespearean language in Romeo and Juliet. Unfortunately, unlike those two movies, we don't have the genuine article for one minute in Moulin Rouge. Although both McGregor and Kidman can sing passably (as well as act to a much higher level than this tosh deserves), they are not Elton John. So the ""Contract with the Audience"" is fake from the start. Many will think this is quibbling. After all, you have Kidman looking stunning, Kylie Minogue thrown in for good measure, incredibly amazing sets (literally - suspense of disbelief vaporises in the first few minutes), some nice song and dance routines and, all in all, a couple of hours of nice, mindless, fluffy entertainment. Occasionally there lines of dialogue not blatantly taken from a song. These are instantly recognizable by the fact that they are badly written and would probably never have made the charts eg ""She is mine!"" or ""Things aren't always as they seem."" The better lines are nicked from Madonna, Bowie, Elton John etc etc. and the only (apparently original) line that has the semblance of being produced by anyone with experience of writing is the one used for the publicity: ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."" Not bad. It seems Luhrmann and his co-writer, having relied on brilliant dancers and a brilliant play in their former efforts and feel that a scriptwriter is dispensable. Moulin Rouge, whilst demonstrating some wonderful cinematic techniques and looking like the actors had great fun making it, proves that it this isn't so. If you go and see Moulin Rouge, keep your expectations low, have several pints of beer first, and rave about how wonderful it's going to be beforehand - it won't be - but you might get through it by convincing yourself you've had a nice time.",Moulin Rouge!

After that, when my eyes caught up with the too-fast camera cuts, I started to enjoy it. I was totally unprepared for the comedic aspects of the movie and found it a pleasant surprise. I particularly enjoyed the sequence where they are making up the plot of ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" in a panic and end up producing the show from that. And what a wonderful performance by Nicole Kidman. I thought at first that her songs were being dubbed, but according to the credits, that was really her. She has a fine voice, and sang very well.

It is a gloriously cinematic spectacle with opulent imagery directed with an eye for rich color, especially the color of rouge... It is also a breathtaking and poignant piece of cinema, a disco of dreams, a crazy and daring show, a vibrant screen fantasy, a ""Bohemian Revolution,"" a magical movie for those who love romance, pop music and old musical movies...Nicole Kidman gives the film its soul... She is the ""sparkling diamond"" of the show, the toast of Paris, the city's top courtesan... She melts her characterization with a sizzling, yet tender, performance... She is undeniably sexy, a beautiful singer, a flashy dancer whose heart sings whenever she sees Christian... In many ways, she is drawn as the ultimate sex goddess, as enigmatic as Greta Garbo, and her glamor masks her pain as well as her happiness... Kidman gives the film its central erotic charge, and its romantic thrills... She sways on a flying trapeze belting out Marilyn Monroe's ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,"" and Madonna's ""Material Girl.""Ewan McGregor achieves a nice mix of optimism and desperation, emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet-hero...

Despite its flaws (and boy, does it have them!), I still walked away satisfied with the experience. I only wish I could have seen it in a theater and not merely on my television at home! It is not subtle at all. Neither the costumes, characterizations, or editing are unstated whatsoever. The plot is basically Camille meets La Boheme, with big doses of farce comedy interspersed with tragic romance. Yet somehow it all works-- well, for the most part.I will admit, I prefer the comical scenes to the more emotional ones.

64,noralee,"OVer Opulent, Frantic Screen-Filler",4,19 December 2005,"""Moulin Rouge"" proves the Mullahs of Iran right -- Hollywood is The Great Satan, spreading its decadent ways around the world, infecting British actors to an Australian director and lead actress, and spending money opulently beyond most countries' GDP.I am second to none in my appreciation of Busby Berkeley musicals, but I never thought them lackluster, or modest and understated. Evidently, Baz Luhrmann does, as his charming opening mis en scene builds up from old black and white movie musicals. His script has the bad guy (the most ineffectual British villain on screen in years) shriek to the Bohemians ""I reject your dogma!"" and Baz most certainly, most emphatically rejects the Dogma 95 filmmakers of social realism. Baz finds even Ken Russell and Terry Gilliam too tame, though I think at least Russell has also done opera directing as Baz has. The eye-popping MTV Movie Awards production of ""Lady Marmalade"" was more restrained (and in fact more entertaining and more musical) than how the song is used in the movie. The camera and the editing just never stop; every millimeter of film stock is full and moves.Ewan MacGregor comes out the best; in a total opposite of his ""Trainspotting"" druggie, here his wide-eyed innocent is sweet even when singing medleys of romantic clichés. (Too bad effective cynical songs about love weren't countered -- I waited in vain for ""What's Love Got to Do With It."")Poor Nicole Kidman is simply miscast. Much as Marilyn Monroe imitated Carol Channing's performance in ""How To Marry a Millionaire,"" Nicole must imitate not one, not two, but at least three Madonna videos (from ""Material Girl"" through to the pseudo-Indian influenced ""Ray of Light""). Did Madonna turn down the role as she was busy with Baby #2 and marriage? Did Baz not offer it to her or did the movie moguls think she couldn't fill the seats? The role needs very little acting so would have fit the Courtesan to the World quite well. (I found it amusing that the term courtesan is used every five minutes when the movie ""Dangerous Beauty"" was re-titled from ""The Courtesan"" because the producers were convinced audiences wouldn't know what the word meant.) Poor John Leguizamo is as irritating as Jar Jar Binks as a clownish Toulouse Latrec with a lisp; the poor guy has to play a dancing magical sitar. Like ""Shrek"" and ""A Knight's Tale,"" this is a movie musical with no original music, but highly original use of covers, if most are in pieces and medleys. I particularly liked the version of ""Roxanne"" as if it were done by Tom Waits in a brothel, while the producers' pitch to the investor paled next to ""The Producers."" I'm quite sure that the audience was frequently laughing at the film, not with it.Note to movie musical producers -- watch the Tonys and see that there are plenty of talented people around who really do know how to sing and dance.(originally written 6/15/2001)",Moulin Rouge!

66,drystyx,Shades of Rocky Horror in very clever musical,7,15 May 2007,"You can't watch this film without comparing it to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, and how much you like one is probably how much you'll like the other. It is a stunning musical with bold in your face camera work that is expertly spliced to give the full effect. The story is the basic boy meets girl, which is refreshing in this day of movies in which boy already owns girl. Finally, a throwback to what a film should be. True romance. This movie is for those who are free of spirit so to speak, and possibly not enjoyed as much by the one who is satisfied with the status quo. This film takes chances. It explores, and it takes you on a journey with each separate frame. A lot of the songs are mainstays of pop, refitted and modified. They take some of the lesser pop songs (Roxanne, Like a Virgin), and improve them greatly. These are possibly the best cover songs you will ever hear. I only saw it twice, so I cannot discern the minor characters, but I could tell they were there, and while it will take me more viewings to see how logical they are, it is obvious they are cinematic and work artistically. The main characters are all very entertaining. The hero is a throwback to the old Hollywood era, and is remarkably charismatic. The heroine seems to be a direct spin off of Madonna herself, and the performance is superb. She isn't a natural beauty, but has glitz and glamour galore. The head bad guy is a riot, and it's a toss up as to whether he or the minor characters steal the show. The henchman is more of a force and face, and rarely speaks, but he is very well done. The master of ceremonies has the broadest range written into his lines, and he doesn't disappoint. The music is all spectacular. The scenery is spectacular. The characters have the cult film quality of stereotypes who evolve into characters. This has all the makings of a cult classic if it catches on. Again, the music is very moving and awesome. I gave it an initial 8, but as time goes on and I see it again, and if the cult quality remains, I'll probably raise that rating.",Moulin Rouge!

I receive more enjoyment in watching a music video on MTV.At least they are over in a few minutes. The images went so fast on the big  huge screen, they gave me a headache  & I left after about  40 minutes & got my money back. With all the extreme closeups I was unable to understand what was happpening. Most of the song arrangements were an insult to my memory of the enjoyment I had when I first heard them.

68,Boyo-2,Worthwhile for McGregor & Broadbent,5,16 July 2002,"I saw 'Romeo and Juliet' so had some sense of what Baz puts on a screen. For a lot of this movie, his style is appropriately over-the-top and gives the movie a ton of life.  Then it drags some in the middle and at the end.  The level of intensity could not, I guess, be maintained, so you are left with some forgettably overlong dance & songs. 'Roxanne' took forever!I didn't enjoy Nicole as much I had hoped to.  I can see why she didn't win Best Actress.  Its not that there is anything wrong with her, but she's not sympathetic enough to make you respond to her plight as much as you could have.  Jim Broadbent must have been really great in 'Iris', to have been nominated and won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for that movie instead of this one. He's electrifying as the owner of the club who is also a thoughtless pimp. Seeing him do a cover of 'Like a Virgin' was a highlight for me. 
However, all good things emerge from Ewan McGregor's quantum leading man performance.  He is emotional, he can sing like a bird, and he has the talent combined with the looks to make you love him like you are supposed to in the great tradition of Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant.  His underacting is perfectly suited to the movie and did I mention he sings his knickers off? 6/10, all for Ewan's talent and charm.",Moulin Rouge!
69,adamjohns-42575,"Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love!",5,10 April 2021,"I have seen this film many times and I've only just realised that Audrey was played by Faramir from 'The Lord Of The Rings' (David Wenham). I thought it was just a manly woman. How bizarre?Although I do like this film and I think the story is fantastic, it's already quite dated and the silliness in the first hour or so is quite hard to watch in 2021. A lot of them are playing caricatures and I wonder if it might not have been better if they had made it in to a cartoon. The Duke remains a caricature throughout, which adds to my disdain for him, where the others at least become a tad more real.For me the film really becomes something amazing when 'The Argentinian' and Christian sing 'El Tango Roxanne', a stunning performance vocally and in its choreography. When I appear on Strictly Come Dancing in a few years, I hope the audience keep me in long enough to do the Tango to this piece, preferably with Gorka or Giovanni or Alijaz or Kevin from Grimsby if he comes back?The nonsense beginning is quite overpowering and I did feel like I should apologise for it, as I sat next to my Mother who hadn't seen it before. It's a shame too, because the soundtrack is fantastic, as are the dances, but they all get a bit lost by the rushing around and fast talking. It's something that I have found with a lot of films and I wonder how many I've turned off before I could see the second half where it all calms down and wins me over.Ewan does a great job in his role. He really does seem a bit like a lost British guy in Paris for the first time and overwhelmed by these larger than life people.Just a few years ago this would probably have appeared higher on my list of films, but with instant classics like 'The Greatest Showman' and 'Chicago' more recently released, it kind of loses its shine somewhat.",Moulin Rouge!
70,rbverhoef,The movie musical,9,2 February 2003,"Moulin Rouge! has one of the most simple stories I know but it comes in the most beautiful package I can imagine. Almost nothing is new in the movie, but all that old stuff together is one of the most original things I have seen.We have a forbidden love packed in a movie musical. All the songs used sound familiar but totally new at the same time. We hear a beautiful version of Your Song from Elton John and a refreshing version of Roxanne from The Police. We hear so much more songs we recognize but don't know. The only original song, Come What May, is a beautiful one as well. The actors all do their own singing. It is terrific.Sometimes the screen seems hectic, but it is all in favor of the atmosphere of the movie. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous and great in her part as Satine, the courtisane who falls in love with the poor writer. Ewan McGregor is that writer and he as well does a tremendous job. I loved the supporting roles: John Leguizamo as Toulouse, Richard Roxburgh as the Duke who wants Satine because he pays for the new play they will do in the Moulin Rouge, and especially Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler, the boss of the Moulin Rouge.The story doesn't matter very much, it is the way the whole movie is brought to us. In living colors, with bright actors, terrific settings and costumes, perfect voices for beautiful songs, a sharp cinematography, all put together by a very good director, Baz Luhrmann.

Of course I enjoyed it.  It's impossible not to.  But it's an entertaining trifle rather than ... I don't know, rather than whatever it was trying to be.  Luhrmann's earlier ""Strictly Ballroom"" is probably more the thing ""Moulin Rouge"" was reaching towards.  It has the same unbridled cinematic hedonism, but with more depth, more coherence, certainly more sincerity.  We're told more than once that this is a story of ""truth, beauty, freedom, and above all, love"".  But the film has little to say about freedom and nothing whatever to say about truth and beauty - those three were thrown in simply to make up the numbers.  Besides, what does the slogan MEAN?  When the Bohemians announce that ""truth"" is one of their ideals, are they saying that one ought to tell the truth, or discover the truth, or face the truth, or are they speaking aesthetics, and saying something about art being true to life?  Your guess is as good as mine.As for the editing - did Luhrmann HAVE to disfigure his fine creative work so much?  A lot of the art direction is fantastic, but we can only find out that it's fantastic by a process akin to forensic science.  We never get an uninterrupted look at anything.  And even WITHIN the rare uncut shots, there's the appearance too much frantic cut-and-paste.  This is exactly what people feared would happen when editors started to use laptops rather than scissors.  With many movies it doesn't matter, but in this case Luhrmann could have made something special, if he hadn't put it through a blender.Don't let me dissuade you from seeing it (as if I could).  You're bound to have fun.  You'll be introduced to a lovely fantasy world (albeit one that feels only just large enough to hold the story Luhrmann tells), and there's no denying that the cast strain every muscle, nor that Luhrmann is inventive - and what's more, ambitious.  The film wouldn't be as good as it is were it not for his admirable desire to make a lavish masterpiece along the lines of, and worthy of being placed alongside, such films as ""The Children of Paradise"" and ""The Red Shoes"".

75,Sherazade,Hollywood's Devdas!,8,21 April 2006,"Gosh! I loved that Ewan and Niccy did their own singing and dancing in this. I just love reality and musicals! Especially reality in musicals. Anywho, for those of your not familiar with the tale of Devdas that I mentioned in my summary, well, Devdas is a sort of Bengali Indian story of Romeo and Juliet but it's completely original because it draws from true life. Boy and girl love each other but are driven apart by forces within their surroundings. Moulin Rouge is sort of like it as well, with the all star cast to boot. I mean, we're talking stellar director Baz Luhrman, actors Nicole Kidman, Ewan Mcgregor, Jim Broadbent, John Leguiziamo, singer Kylie Minogue among others. The film, about two star crossed lovers is as lush and as lavish as any epic Bollywood piece. Don't miss the stirring ballad 'Come what may' sung by Kidman and Mcgregor, and that infectious Lady Marmalade end credits/Grammy winning soundtrack song that caused the likes of Christina Aguilera, Mya, Little Kim, and Pink to come together for that party! Kidman is the most famous Moulin Rouge performer and Mcgregor is the writer who falls for her, too bad the theatre funder who Kidman is being forced to pretend she is interested in also has plans for her. Match that with tuberculosis in a day and age where it was untreatable and you know this can't end well. One of my sister's actually thought that all that coughing from Kidman's character was a result of her corset being too tight. LOL! Nice movie though, one of my favourites.",Moulin Rouge!
76,Galina_movie_fan,A screaming mess of an attempt to make a super modern musical/love story,2,11 September 2006,"I did not like Moulin Rouge the first time I saw it and I realized why when I visited the exhibit in the Washington, DC National Gallery ""Toulouse - Lautrec and Monmartre"" last April and saw close to 200 paintings, posters, etchings, prints, and other works of one of the most original, ironic, and insightful painters ever.No one was able to capture Monmartre the way Toulouse-Lautrec did - its raucous spirit, unbridled energy, tawdry behavior, garish colors, and provocative celebrities. Lautrec's works are filled with the unique atmosphere of daring, racy Monmartre of the late 1890s. To make a film about Moulin Rouge which is inseparable from Monmarte and to present a stupid caricature, the ridiculous and pathetic marionette that (for some unknown to me reasons) was called Henry de Toulouse-Lautrec and to take away the mood, the atmosphere and substitute them with loud, senseless mess - was unforgivable. I bought a CD in the Museum shop with the original Moulin Rouge songs and music that were written during the ""Belle Époque"". Even though some of them sound a little funny and naive today, they are natural, they are not the fakes that were used in the movie and were supposed to represent the sound of Monmartre of the years long gone.Well, the DVD was on the shelf in the library where I volunteer every Saturday and I decided to give the movie the second chance. I should not have done it. I watched about 20 minutes, and that was all I could take. I remember from the first time that ""Roxanne"" was filmed well and I found and watched the scene again. I like the song and the dancing but I hated how they had to squeeze Kidman in there. The big part of me not accepting the movie is that I don't see Kidman's talent in this particular movie, I don't like her acting, and she irritated me most of the time. There are more things about ""Moulin Rouge"" that I don't like. I hate the story; I hate the stupid dialogs about ""summer of love"". Cancan is a very sexy dance and well performed it would take your breath away. Whatever they called cancan in the movie was not unlike the group of cows performed on the scene.What a screaming mess of an attempt to make a super modern musical/love story/whatever.

77,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Possibly Worst Musical Ever,2,12 October 2020,"That's as long as you consider Moulin Rouge to be a musical. I humbly submit it's more like a colorfully filmed drunken karaoke night. Or an ill-conceived two-hour MTV video of a concept album, as the boomers used to call them.
I don't actually care that the setting is supposed to be 19th century France. It could be 12th century Czechoslovakia. Makes no difference. It would still be filled with mediocre pop songs being lip-synched by actors possessing dubious charms, to be charitable.
Heck, even the pop songs are themselves so badly rendered they're barely recognizable.

There followed many weeks of ""Shall we watch this tonight"" to which I replied ""I'm not really in the mood for it."" To be honest, I was deathly afraid of being subjected to another musical after being scarred by Chicago. However, when the evening finally came that we sat down to watch Moulin Rouge, I was very pleasantly surprised.It has a style that is unique. It's weird and wacky and doesn't even pretend to contain anything like an original song. In fact the exact opposite is true as it it shamelessly borrows any song remotely relevant to the storyline. In fact, trying to spot all the song references let alone the songs themselves becomes quite a game.It's difficult to sum up Moulin Rouge. It's just fun, fast paced and never lets go of your interest for a moment. Initially, however, be prepared for a certain amount of confusion as your head (if it's anything like mine and was expecting a dreary Chicago-style dirge-fest) struggles to get a feel for the style and pace of the film. After that it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride right to the end. The simple plot has no surprises and you know what'll happen pretty much right from the start, but the story isn't what makes this movie entertaining. It's the music - a fact lost on the Chicago writers.Maybe I just like weird musicals but this one rates up there just behind Rocky Horror and Shop of Horrors on my list. Well worth a watch.",Moulin Rouge!
79,lewiskendell,Extraordinary...for a while.,8,3 November 2010,"""I mean the show will be magnificent, opulent, tremendous, stupendous, gargantuan bedazzlement! A sensual ravishment.

Grand, sexy, bright, colorful, manic, clever, sumptuous, lavish, and endlessly amusing. Kidman was wonderful, the songs and performances grab you and don't let go, and I was just intensely interested by it all. It was the kind of start that anyone who enjoys a fun movie would find irresistible.The second half, however, cooled my ardor a bit. The story takes a turn for the more serious and tragically romantic. The liveliness was replaced with sadness, the fun was supplanted with the dour, and Nicole Kidman was tragically over-dressed. I'm not claiming that these aspects of the movie were flaws (except Nicole Kidman not being half-naked anymore), but they didn't appeal to me as much as what came before. I found myself losing interest somewhat.So my score is an average of a stellar first half and a disappointing (for me) finale. Depending on your preference for the melodramatic, you may not share my reservations. Regardless, this is a movie that anyone with even a passing fondness for musicals must see.

80,philip_vanderveken,This certainly wasn't what I expected it would be,6,26 May 2005,"I probably don't have to tell you what the Moulin Rouge really is and where it can be found. It's one of the most famous cabarets in the world and even today it still breaths an atmosphere of decadence, eroticism and freedom. This of course had to be the subject of a movie sooner or later and in 2001 it finally happened. ""Moulin Rouge!"" saw its first (stage) light and caused a little shock wave in the world of cinema.At the turn of the 19th and 20th century a young English poet named Christian, comes to Paris to pursue an unpaid, but free career as a Bohemian writer. Soon he meets a group that asks him to write a musical for them, which they will perform in the Moulin Rouge, the most famous underworld night club in Paris. When he goes for the very first time to that famous night club, he immediately falls in love with the beautiful courtesan Satine. Satine thinks he's 'The Duke', the man she has to please, because her boss expects a lot of money for him so he can build a new and proper theater. The Duke seems to be willing to give him that money, but he has one request: he wants exclusive access to the favors of Satine, who doesn't have any problem with that, because she finally wants to become a proper actress in a proper theater. And normally that request shouldn't pose any problem, but in the meantime Satine has done something no courtesan should ever do: she has fallen in love with Christian. This is the beginning of a dramatic love story that sooner or later will end in a tragedy...I loved the fact that this movie wanted to give an idea of how the Moulin Rouge looked like in the early nineteen hundreds. I'm very interested in that time period and I was really looking forward to it. And exactly that was MY biggest mistake, because this movie hasn't got much to do with the history of the Moulin Rouge or the people who worked there. This movie isn't much more but an extremely fast paced, almost video clip like, vehicle for popular pop songs from the last fifty years that have been slightly renewed. Sure it all has a modern and slick feeling, but it also gave me the impression of a hollow shell. It almost felt like this was made for all those Americans who don't know anything about Europe, but who love flashy shows and fast consumption and who find everything great and lovely, as long as they don't have to think too much ... This movie never really gives you a moment to catch a breath, to come back to your senses. It's a constant whirlpool of emotions, music and spectacular events. I know many people love that (if you check the percentage of people that gave this movie a 10, you'll get an idea), but for me personally it didn't really work. I might even say that it sometimes started to work on my nerves. Still, not everything about the movie was bad. The chemistry between Satine and Christian felt real thanks to the nice performances of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I never thought those two would ever from a couple in a movie, but I must say that it really worked. So definitely no complaints about that. As a conclusion I want to add that it is a good thing that the genre of the musical isn't dead yet. It has always had a spot in the history of cinematography and it should have one in the future as well. But I have my doubts about the fact if this is the best way to go. Every day we are flooded by millions of video clips on TV stations like MTV, do we really need that in a movie as well??? Personally I don't think so and that's why I give this movie a 6/10",Moulin Rouge!

Prepare to have your senses assaulted and your musical assumptions challenged. You've got to know your musical history to appreciate the allusions in this satire. Incorporating a number of anachronistic songs and motifs, this odd spectacle ostensibly set in Paris in 1900 attempts to look at the mystique of the city and the Moulin Rouge nightclub from a new and surreal angle. The special effects are wonderful, but ultimately this film is more bizarre than engaging. If the credits had said ""Directed by Salvadore Dali"" I would have believed them.

The editing mainly in the first part shows an overwhelming speed of successive plans almost psychedelic playing successfully with images and sounds and showing spectacular choreographic scenes. In the second part that image rhythm slows down a bit more accordingly with the dramatic plot that develops itself around a Traviata love story of the tb ridden courtisan and the young poor but talented writer. Near the end there is a fabulous musical dance with an Argentinian theme which makes counterpoint with the dramatic scene where the courtisan is going to sacrifice herself to the lust of the rich Duke who is financially supporting the show. The weakest part of the movie is the soundtrack mostly made of more modern melodies like ""The Sound of Music"" which have nothing to do with the movie supposed era.

Unfortunately she's been promised to the Duke whose going to turn the club into a theater and Satine into a famous actress. Against all odds they pursue their romance with the villainous Duke moving in. The movie is wonderfully romantic, magical and infinitely creative. There is no other cinematic experience like this.

That the film is of the musical genre added to this expectation.In reality the film is however quite modern, with fast montage and short takes. It has been described as the longest MTV clip ever.The film is cleverly made but has no emotional effect on me. Lead actress Nicole Kidman, who came out of the shadow of her then husband Tom Cruise about this time (in for example ""The others"" (2001, Alejandro Amenabar) and ""Dogville"" (2003, Lars von Trier)), plays an unapproachable diva.For some reasons ""Moulin rouge"" made me think of ""Wings of desire"" (1987, Wim Wenders), evidently a totally different film. In both films however a love affair blossoms between a woman who performs on the trapeze and a man who used to be a specatator. Because of his love the man quits being a passive spectator and becomes actively involved in the action. In ""Mouling rouge"" the man is a writer, in ""Wings of desire"" he is an angel.

That being said: there were moments in it, and some aspects, that I found incredibly frustrating... yet there was a lot that did work, and I found it growing on me as the movie went along.I tried watching this about 8 or 9 years ago and couldn't stomach the first fifteen minutes, and so shut it off. I think it was right around the time they started singing Nirvana; I just said 'nope,' not for me.Returning to it now, those first fifteen minutes were still a fairly tough sit. The editing and loudness is just ridiculous. I didn't know whether it was supposed to be funny or cool or what- I was overwhelmed and confused, whilst still recognising that technically it was at least interesting.Things got better slowly- an extended comedic sequence filled with innuendo felt like it was from an Austin Powers movie, and tonally the whole thing felt all over the place. Nothing was given room to breathe, and certain stunning shots would only last a second or so before a jarring cut to something else. There were a few brief moments here and there where I literally couldn't comprehend what was going on.I think the movie did slow down a little in its second hour, or maybe I just grew more used to the style... maybe both? I started to enjoy the music, bold colours, fast-paced musical numbers, and the acting more. The latter is quite good, honestly, especially when it comes to Ewan McGregor, who was excellent. I hated John Leguizamo in this movie though- his character was super irritating, even by Baz Luhrmann standards.And while the final act feels a little drawn out, it's got some stunning moments, and probably the best music in the whole film.Overall, it's exhausting and insane, but for me at least it mostly worked. I can understand people loving this movie. I can understand people hating this movie. And honestly, I can understand anyone being anywhere inbetween on this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
88,kevin c,SPECTACLE,4,23 September 2001,"As a man who dislikes musicals, I was surprised to find myself enjoying this film. I was also surprised to find that Kidman and McGregor could sing. Kidman can certainly hold a film these days, and her opening is breathtaking.In many ways this film is just like a West End show. It's all spectacle over content or narrative. Luhrmann's 2 previous efforts had greater substance, but perhaps not this much style.",Moulin Rouge!
89,brchthethird,Shakespeare by way of SHOWGIRLS,5,28 February 2016,"MOULIN ROUGE seems like one of those movies that you either love or hate, mostly because of Baz Luhrmann's style. I actually don't mind his style that much, having enjoyed Australia and, to a lesser degree, THE GREAT GATSBY. Still, I wasn't even ten minutes into this and my head was already spinning. Thankfully, he doesn't keep the visual intensity cranked up to eleven the entire time, but a lot of time was spent in a hyperactive mode that gave me somewhat of a headache, while also laughing at the near-constant absurdity of what I was watching. If I had to describe it, and there are a number of ways to do so, it was like a fever dream or a roller-coaster that is perpetually on a downward course: exhilarating but also exhausting. The plot seemed almost an afterthought, with every romantic cliché of the last 600 years or so being stuffed into a story of tragically doomed romance that was probably old hat when Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. The acting, from an admittedly impressive roster of talented actors, was so over-the-top that it put primetime soap operas to shame. Just to give one example, John Leguizamo (as Toulouse-Lautrec?) sounded like Elmer Fudd with a lisp. Hopefully they had fun making this because I'd be ashamed to have this on my resume. Anyhow, acting and story aside, MOULIN ROUGE is a rather inventive (if derivative) movie. I would have never thought to set a musical in turn-of-the-century France yet use modern pop songs. The way in which they weave dozens of them in the dialogue is almost comical at times, but it worked for the most part. Where the film really shone, though, was the production design, sets and costumes. Other than paying the actors, this is probably where the most money was lavished, and it showed. Although confined to a few constructed sets, they were gorgeously realized and popping with detail. I don't know how this movie fared at the 2002 Oscars, but it probably got some well-deserved technical awards. Overall, MOULIN ROUGE was rather overwhelming, as if in a constant absinthe-induced delirium partially achieved through rapid-fire editing which gave it the feel of a two-hour music video. Still, Baz Luhrmann's commitment to overdoing every production element has some limited rewards and those are really what makes this worth watching, if only once.",Moulin Rouge!
90,mattymatt4ever,Starts off with a bang! Ends with a whisper.,7,9 July 2001,"Just the first few minutes of ""Moulin Rouge"" totally blew me away! Everything from the set designs to the art direction to the editing to the cinematography to the costume designs are absolutely spectacular!  The movie should win Oscars in ALL those categories.  I can honestly say the first half of this movie is like nothing you've ever seen!  And it is undescribable.  All I have to say is it took a huge, vivid imagination.  Of course, you have to watch ""MR"" with an open mind.  Let your imagination run wild!  Especially when you have modern songs being sung in 1900 France. There's even a scene where everybody in the club starts singing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana.  Just like I said about ""A Knight's Tale"" scenes like that are totally innaccurate--historically speaking--but they're great to look at.  Speaking of things that are great to look at, Nicole Kidman couldn't have looked more beautiful!  If you see some of her outfits in this movie--WOW!  It's beyond comprehension.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang great, and it was nice to find out they used their real voices--I at least assumed McGregor might've been lip-synching.  On a musical level, this film works out splendidly, working in many modern hit songs into the soundtrack that will keep you singing along.  However, I was disappointed by the second half.  The first half is so upbeat, so in-your-face and gets your mood so pumped up.  Then the film suddenly takes a dramatic turn.  It takes on a dreary tone, and I felt quite uneasy about the transition.  When you have a spectacular opening like this, it's hard getting adjusted to a more quiet, downbeat, depressing tone.  I had a hard time keeping myself awake!  But I have to say, that climax with the gun is very creative and I got a kick out of that. 
The first half of ""MR"" is so striking and original that I have to give it a recommendation.  It's blend of great music, fast pacing, unrelenting energy, humor, sexual innuendos and beautiful visuals will keep you captivated!  In the second half, you might want to go out for popcorn.  Some may appreciate the sad tone towards the end and will squeak a few tears, but I had a hard time dealing with the transition.  For that, I will let you use discretion. 
My score:  7 (out of 10)",Moulin Rouge!
91,hall895,Fabulous sights and sounds at the Moulin Rouge,7,2 September 2014,"Christian and Satine fall in love and what a great love story it could be. Except this love, as the film tells us right at the very beginning, is doomed. So there could be a touch of melancholy to this whole film. But director Baz Luhrmann blows you away with the sights, the sounds, the frantic energy of the Moulin Rouge. How can you be feeling glum when you're having so much fun? This film draws you in and never lets you go. Yes, the singing and dancing are quite good fun. But there is that captivating love story too. We know there will be no happily ever afters. But we love Christian and Satine just as they love one another. You can't help but be charmed by this couple. And while giving you such a lovely couple to root for the film also gives you a dastardly villain to root against. The Duke, rich and powerful, wants Satine. But her heart belongs to Christian. The Duke does not like this. Not one little bit. Complications ensue.Initially Satine's heart does not belong to anyone. She does not feel she is free to love anyone. She's the star attraction at the famed Paris cabaret Moulin Rouge. She's a singer, a dancer...and a courtesan, which is a fancy word for prostitute. When the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler, needs someone to finance the club's new show Satine knows what she must do. She will make the Duke believe she loves him so he will finance the show. And this arrangement is not without benefit to Satine, this new show will perhaps give her a chance to be a real actress. But there's a little mix-up. She comes to believe that Christian, a penniless writer, is actually the Duke. By the time she realizes her mistake Christian is already totally smitten with her. And then the real Duke shows up and things could get really messy. But a song and dance number saves the day. In this movie, when in doubt, a song and dance number is always the answer.So the Duke ends up agreeing to pay for the show, which Christian will be writing. Of course Christian is much more interested in Satine than he is in the show. Eventually, through song of course, he will win her heart. Then it's a matter of keeping their love hidden away from the oblivious Duke. Satine starts spending all her time with Christian. For the good of the show you see. A girl's gotta rehearse, right? Wink, wink. This makes for a rather unhappy Duke and a very nervous Zidler who needs to keep the man with the money on board. Meanwhile, lurking in the background there is that knowledge that there will be no happy ending. The whole film is in essence told in flashback, Christian in 1900 telling us of the events which happened a year earlier. The Christian of 1900 is a completely heartbroken man, the movie tells us how he got to such a state. What had become of his beloved Satine?Right from the start director Luhrmann lets us know this film is going to be a little bit different. The film's events may unfold in 1899 but the songs Luhrmann uses are not of that period, it's a contemporary soundtrack. When Christian breaks out into some Sound of Music you think that's interesting. When you then hear a little Smells Like Teen Spirit it becomes clear that absolutely anything goes in this film. And all these songs which would seem to be so out of place work so perfectly. Some, such as Satine's renditions of Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend and Material Girl, are so fitting they may as well have been written for this film. Other songs are a bit more of a stretch but Luhrmann makes it all work. And as much as Luhrmann it is the cast who make it work, most notably Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman playing Christian and Satine. Their acting is wonderful and their singing is strong and convincing. And needless to say they look the part as well. McGregor has an air of innocence and immense likability. And it is certainly easy to buy into the breathtaking Kidman as the woman who makes Paris's collective heart race. Jim Broadbent is also notably excellent as Zidler and he gets the film's funniest musical number as well.This is a film with constant energy to it, full of life. It's a bit of a sensory overload. The costumes and color make for a visual feast. The songs are performed wonderfully, the dances are beautifully choreographed. The movie hardly ever stops to take a breath, it's constant motion. There are some moments where you wonder if the tone is quite right. The aforementioned Broadbent number is indeed funny but coming as the film takes a darker turn it seems a touch out of place. And then there are moments where maybe it gets a little too dark, where the Duke goes off the deep end and becomes too evil to take seriously. Yes, he needed to be the bad guy but not that bad. But these are small quibbles. All in all the film is a lot of fun. The story is engaging, the performances are terrific and the music kicks things up to a whole other level. You have your touching love songs and you have your wild, loud dance explosions. Every song, every snippet, serves a purpose. The film is somewhat over the top but gleefully so. It makes for great entertainment. Very fitting that the title of the show Christian is writing is Spectacular Spectacular. Moulin Rouge! is spectacular indeed.",Moulin Rouge!
92,jhclues,"Mostly, It's a Story About Love",9,11 June 2001,"This is a story about life.  And about the artists who congregated in Paris in 1900, living a bohemian lifestyle and giving the world the fruits of their labor, of their art, for which they would gladly bleed and die.  But mostly this is a story about love.  Of a young man named Christian, a penniless writer, and a singer named Satine, who for a moment came together and tasted the nectar of the gods.  `Moulin Rouge,' written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, takes you into a world that is bright and brilliant, fast and flashy and filled with all of the things that make life worth living.  It's a fantasy world of song and color, of soaring hearts and aspirations-- but also of the reality upon which the illusion of it all is built.  And the effects of that reality on Christian and Satine, whose love has been forbidden by that same reality they seek to dispel by impaling it with the artistic endeavors that give them life.If Disney had commissioned a film to be written by Shakespeare, directed by Fellini and produced by Spielberg, this would be it.  It's a dizzying, whirling burst of lights, colors, music, drama and comedy that assails the senses and will hold you spellbound from beginning to end.  Like the bohemians he portrays, Luhrmann leaves convention behind and dips instead into his own inspired and highly imaginative formula to tell his story. The cinematography (by Donald McAlpine) and art direction (by Ann-Marie Beauchamp and Ian Gracie) are brilliant, as well as the production design (by Catherine Martin) and the sets (by Brigitte Broch).  One of the many inspired touches Luhrmann employs here, is the use of different film speeds throughout, which, when combined with the superlative, quick-cut editing (by Jill Bilcock), makes it all transporting and surreal.
Ewan McGregor turns is a terrific performance as Christian, the young man who arrives in Paris with nothing more than spirit and a head filled with ideas and ideals.  When artistic differences leaves Zidler (Jim Broadbent), proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, without a writer for a new show, `Spectacular, Spectacular,' Christian steps in.  And so does McGregor, who shines in the part.  And the boy can sing!  He may not have the greatest voice in the world, but it's a good `stage voice,' and most importantly, he can sell a song, as evidenced by the scene in which he puts across Elton John's `Your Song.'  McGregor has a charismatic screen presence, and in this role he really gets a chance to demonstrate his versatility as an actor.As Satine, Nicole Kidman is saucy and sensuous, bringing her character vividly to life, this woman who makes her living by being every man's fantasy as she sings and sashays her way through this world of the Moulin Rouge.  In her heart, she longs to be a serious actress, and if this new show is a success, she just may get her chance.  But first, the show needs someone to finance the lavish production.  They may have one-- the Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh), has expressed interest, but he has one condition.  If he pays for the show he wants something in return (besides a profit on his investment).  He wants Satine.  But so does Christian, who has nothing to offer the show but his talent, and nothing for Satine but his love.  Zidler, meanwhile, aware of the Duke's demands, urges Satine to turn her back on Christian, to `save him.'  And beyond and besides all that is happening, there is something else going on with Satine, something more personal, that ultimately will have an effect on the outcome of the dilemma for all concerned.The supporting cast includes John Leguizamo (Toulouse Lautrec), Kylie Minogue (The Green Fairy), Garry McDonald (Doctor), Jacek Koman (The Narcoleptic Argentinean), Matthew Whittet (Satie), Kerry Walker (Marie) and Laszlo Lukas (Conductor).  With an eye for detail and his imagination thrust into overdrive, Luhrmann has put together and delivered one of the brightest films to come along in quite awhile.  `Moulin Rouge' is an explosion of sights and sounds, a film laced with humor and visual largess that holds a poignant and dramatic story at it's heart.  Entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable, this is a memorable film and a satisfying movie-going experience. It's a story about love; a story told through the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",Moulin Rouge!

For starters the music was not what i was expecting , it encorporates modern pop songs instead of fluffy , new , songs which made it all the more enjoyable. The photography is fantastic especially the panning from one building to another and the rushing from street to street and the set is brilliant. The story is hardly rocket science and is easy to follow especially because the cast is headed by two brilliant young performers in Nocole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.The rest of the cast are superb too.

96,Bob-45,"Expressionism, Anyone?",6,2 January 2002,"Expressionistic art BY DESIGN brings attention to it's artificiality.  Even though many films use expressionistic elements (""Tom Jones,"" ""A Hard Days Night,"" ""Airplane,"" ""The Naked Gun), I've seen only four films could genuinely be classified as ""expressionistic films:"" ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" Fellini's ""Never Bet the Devil Your Head, Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles"" and now ""Moulin Rouge,"" which is the LEAST successful of the four. The other films used expressionism to reinforce their themes.  However, unless writer/ director Baz Luhrman INTENDED an antiromantic picture (which I believe he did), his self-conscious, anachronistic artifices work AGAINST the main plot (i.e., the love story between the poor writer and the doomed cabaret singer).  While incredibly beautiful and dreamlike (Oscar worthy cinematography, set decoration, art direction, editing and sound) and boasting great performances by Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent, the main plot is uninvolving, the characters uninteresting and the film is ultimately unsatisfying.Possible Spoilers:I have several reasons for believing the film is MEANT to be antiromantic. Ewan McGregor's dialogue is chock full of ""modern"" ""romantic"" musical lyrics, integrated in a manner assured to bring laughter. The love songs between Kidman and McGregor, while lovely, all appear to be done tongue in cheek.  As McGregor ""sobs"" over Kidman's lifeless body, he appears to be guffawing.  Baz Luhrman could have made his point complete if he'd included a ""lovers singing while walking in the clouds"" sequence at the end of the movie.  Alas, I was left unclear as exactly what WERE his intentions. Oh well, perhaps that's on Disk 2 of the DVD.",Moulin Rouge!

""Moulin Rouge"" is visually stunning in it's cinematography, staging, and costuming. The musical is reborn. The dialogue and fusion of contemporary song lyrics are seamless-- truly inspired. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are simply fabulous. The setting is 1899 at the Moulin Rouge in the ""Bohemian Revolution"" that virtues Truth, Beauty, Freedom... and most of all Love. The introduction of young writer Christian (McGregor)-- Love's champion though he has never been in love-- drew me in. The woman who will be the love of Christian's life, Satine (Kidman), is a beautiful and isolated courtesan, who professes that she is not allowed to love. What a wonderful setting for classic tragedy, and great music along the way. The first few minutes of MR is disorienting, until the realization: ""This is a musical. Deal with it."" The lyrical element is like a genetic code to this movie. The characters come alive through their singing. McGregor is believable as the writer, Christian, experiencing love for the first time. Kidman as Satine balances the tragedy and humor with grace and style. Both are great singers. John Leguizamo as Toulouse Lautrec is surprising as the story's muse. Great work here. The movie must get points for having the audacity of doing a musical number of Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" performed entirely by dudes. See the movie...",Moulin Rouge!

100,stamper,A Marvel of sights and sounds,9,13 November 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This film, set in 1899 is really one of the most original films for years, that has big names and big bucks in it. I must say I was really astonished in how Baz Luhrmann was able to merge the feeling of a 1899 nightclub with modern 20th century music. I mean there were so many modern love songs mingled into the story and singing, I sometimes wondered if the writers had come up with anything of their own. But disregarding the fact that they were all existing songs I have to admire the way they were integrated into this film. That was really a job well done. First of all (for most of them and the ones I recognized) they were rearranged and then the parts were sung by actors and/or some singers. Then there was the enormous variety of genre's the songs were from, without even disturbing one another. I mean there was grunge, soul, pop and rock, with songs like (QUEEN - The Show Must go On; THE POLICE - Roxanne; THE BEATLES - All you need is Love; MADONNA - Material Girl and Like A Virgin; WHITNEY HOUSTON -  I'll Always Love You; NIRVANA - Smells Like Teen Spirit; KISS - I Was Made For Loving You; DAVID BOWIE - Heroes and PATTI LA BELLE - Lady Marmalade). I only list the songs I recognized (and remembered) and their original artists as far as I can remember them, because I do not know who sang them in the film. The mingling of these various popular and famous songs of different genre's into a film about a brothel in the late 20th century is an accomplishment of itself.
As in regards to the story, I feel there is nothing much to say, first of all it is a film about love. And one with a tragic ending (no spoilers here, because Ewan McGregor will reveal this himself within the first 5 minutes of the film). For this it is comparable with the 3 greatest love stories ever told in history (GONE WITH THE WIND, TITANIC and DRACULA). It just has everything to become an instant classic. It is set (as the other three films) in a time where there is no (or not much) electricity and that gives it something of 'the good old days' feeling with a bit of a more romantic feeling, for that was the time when men were still gentlemen and romanticism had it's peak.
As far as the film goes there are three things that stand out. First of all the direction of Baz Luhrmann, who (again) after Romeo and Juliet succeeded in giving a story set in the past something of a modern look. His vision and direction of this story is really great and combines to make this the sights and sounds spectacle it eventually came to be (Oscar nominee for directing I guess, but no award).
Then there are the decorations and the costumes, which are really great and visually so demanding that you become lost in them and are thereby dragged into this romantic, humorous and tragic musical of epic proportions (An Oscar for costumes and a nomination for Art Direction / Set decoration)
Well, as should be done in a film, I saved the highlight for last. The best thing about this film is.....Nicole Kidman. No offense to the other actors who all did a good job, but she really outshone everyone of them, she was superb, magnificent, extraordinary simply put she was just GREAT. She was very, very convincing as the courtesan that wished to be more, that wished to fly away but.well I'm not revealing more than the first five minutes of film do.dies in the end. With that in mind one might predict the ending (as I somehow did) and not like this film, due to predictability. I mean I am not saying that this film should get an award (or even a nomination) for best story or screenplay. No, what I am saying is that this film is so visually exciting and gripping that it overcomes predictability and surges to a highpoint, only to be picked up by Nicole Kidman who takes this film even higher to the top of the mountain, to greatness. Despite that I'm not saying that this film landed on the highest mountain ever, but it sure is in the area nearest to the moon and stars. Leaving behind any movie I've seen this year. Therefore it is in my opinion unavoidable that this film will get the Oscar for best movie (I know it somehow will). For it is by far the best movie of the year 2001.
And the Oscar for best actress goes to (well it will anyway): NICOLE KIDMAN (standing ovations please!!!)

101,bankofmarquis,"In my ""All Time Top 10""",10,15 April 2020,"If one would look at the BankofMarquis ""All Time Top 10"" film list, you will see such stalwarts as THE GODFATHER, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and CITIZEN KANE. It also would contain a ""more modern"" film that doesn't, necessarily, find itself on these types of lists - Baz Luhrman's MOULIN ROUGE from 2001.Yes...it's that good.Set at the turn of the century (the 19th to the 20th century) during the Bohemian Revolution in Paris, MOULIN ROUGE tells the tale of the...you guessed it...the Moulin Rouge theater/club where a young writer (Ewan McGregor) gets pulled into the lives of the artists and others trying to make a living, falling in love with a young courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman) all under the watchful eye of Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent).But it is not the story, but the telling of the story that sets this film apart. It is chaotic, wild, colorful, sexy, grimy, loving, alcoholic and spectacular - all things that not only describe this film, but the Moulin Rouge itself. Directer Baz Luhrman really shines in his vision of this picture that juxtaposes colorful sets and costumes, unique characters and songs and dance and music that tells the tale in a a unique way.Oh...did I mention that most of this music is MODERN music? From Elton John's YOUR SONG to Roger's and Hammerstein's THE SOUND OF MUSIC to LADY MARMALADE to the ingenious use of Sting's ROXANNE (in a tango scene no less), this film is an amalgam of song that fits each scene perfectly. At what first seems incongruous, upon further viewings, the songs are slyly picked to accent the emotions and dramatic purpose of each scene.As for the acting, McGregor and Kidman are beautifully cast (pun intended) as the young lovers. Their good looks radiate across the screen and I thought they had great chemistry. John Leguzamo and the other ""Bohemians"" pop in and out and are uniquely outrageous without being annoying. Richard Roxburgh's antagonist, ""the Duke"", came across in this viewing as not nearly as annoying as I have found him to be previously. Maybe there is more to this character/performance than meets the eye.But it is Jim Broadbent's portrayal of the Master Shoman, Harold Zidler, that steals this film for me. He is a cunning and ingenious showman who (more than once) proves that he will stop at nothing for the ""show to go on"", but there are many notes to Zidler, at once in control and at the same time trying to KEEP control of events spiraling out of his control that actually shows a desperate man doing whatever he can to survive.Add all these ingredients up and you have a film that gets deeper and richer with each subsequent viewing. I have yet to get tired of this film - and I am looking forward to the next time I immerse myself into this world.Letter Grade: A +10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Moulin Rouge!
102,Angry_Arguer,"Aesthetic, Gimmicky Dragster",10,24 June 2004,"The Concept: 'Romeo' meets 'Buckaroo Banzai' meets 'eXistenZ'This is your only spoiler warning...Film is, first and foremost, an art form--no different than paintings, sculpture, music, literature, or theatre.  The fact that we abuse film into entertaining us or just telling stories is humiliating.  When placed in that context, all film is art that varies in quality.  'Moulin Rouge!' is so rich in detail that it has to be fattening.I wasn't planning on liking this one.  Romance/Musicals aren't my forte. However, examining Ang Lee's ""Eat Drink"" allowed me to rethink my criterion. Granted, most entries in the genres are insipid, appealing to our quest for affections, but some have other intentions.  Once you get past the silly little love story, it gets VERY interesting.Consider:--This is a movie about a book about a play with actors existing in various levels of reality.--There is a distinct layering of images, sounds, and thoughts.  Compare this to any bare-bones Alan Parker musical where everything exists ""onstage"", never in relation to the audience.--Very competent editing, better than 'Blackhawk Down'.  'Blackhawk' relied on an audio rhythm.  Here the cuts are for visual fluency, it takes exposure to learn this method.  Notice how elaborate tracking shots substitute for jump cuts or editing transitions.  Watch every little nook and cranny for details and keep your eyes open for the use of color.  The sound here wasn't as good as I was expecting, 'Amelie' was 2001's best.--Modern songs (from the Beatles to Madonna) are implemented not as fashion statements.  After all, why wasn't Tina Turner's ""What's Love Got to Do With It"" used?  No, the music is also prostituted: cheap and tawdry.  Hence 1899 as the ""summer of love"", 1967 all over again.  We even have a supporting cast of Bohemian hippies, probably the most colorful things you will ever see.--Pay attention to the brainstorming/rehearsal scenes for ""Spectacular Spectacular"", the entire ending is explained.  Notice how we accept it as good humor at first, then as ""drama"" when it's revealed.  Clever, huh? Makes the ""love"" concept all the more disposable.--The battles between the artists and the financiers.  Every real artist goes through these stages, frequently degrading their original visions for the sake of commercial appeal.2001 was a good year for film (with 2 Scott films, a Lynch, this, and 'Amelie', how can you lose?) and the advances made then will probably carry us through the rest of the decade.  Too bad the Oscars got everything screwed up.  If you ignore 'Pearl Harbor', 'Lord of the Rings', and 'Planet of the Apes', it isn't that bad.As for Luhrmann, I'm going to keep an eye on him.  His control here is paramount and he has a near-Scott level of attention to detail, but he's still young.  Here, in particular, he begins to run out of gas about midway (hence the ""dragster""), so I'm holding off on my final judgment on him. Let's see how his ""Alexander"" comes out.In the meantime, let's see Oliver Stone make a musical.  We'd need it after the disaster of 'Chicago'.  Now THAT had no interesting layering, just 'Sound of Music' all over again.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",Moulin Rouge!
103,aesgaard41,Wonderful Nicole Kidman Musical,10,27 January 2006,"To me, this is the movie Nicole Kidman was born to play. I could not see anyone else do it; I mean, who knew she could sing. Ewan McGregor accentuates her performance and creates a role any guy would want to live through; I know I can't watch without saying his lines with him. In the movie, a young writer (McGregor) falls for a courtesan (Kidman) in a bawdy bordello/dance hall after she confuses him for a Duke. To cover, she gets her employer to put on his play created in tandem with Toulouse-Latrec (John Leguizamo at his most eccentric). Modern day love songs from the Beatles to Marilyn Monroe to Madonna litter the plot with curious abandon and the play mirrors and shadows the plot of the movie itself so much they they become intertwined. There's ""Three's Company"" level misunderstandings and cover-ups replete with sexual overtures and enough erotic undertones to choke on (few of the so-called ""show girls"" are very attractive). Jim Broadbent is Kidman's employer, a sort of whorehouse madam in the form of a father figure, and Richard Roxburgh plays the Duke as a violent psychopath barely contained in the form of a naive idiot. The songs are infectious and the imagery is passing, but the whole pop-song opera style with the romanticism is what makes the movie worth seeing. Kidman and McGregor have such chemistry together that it would make sense to use them together in more movies.",Moulin Rouge!
104,FilmOtaku,Visually Stunning,9,5 May 2003,"In an age where there are so many movies provided for us, it's easy to subscribe to the cookie-cutter films that Hollywood turns out.  It's also easy for a jaded old salty dog like myself to find tedium in a lot of what is offered to us today.  A movie that makes me feel like I am about 8 years old because I am excited and enthralled at what is happening on the screen is therefore, a rarity.  This film is a rare gem that made me feel that way.Moulin Rouge is the story of Satine (Nicole Kidman), the most popular courtesan in Paris and Christian (Ewan MacGregor), her lover.  It is an unlikely romance between an unattainable woman and an impoverished writer, which must be kept hidden because Satine has been essentially betrothed to the man who is financially backing the Moulin Rouge, The Duke (Richard Roxborough).  Before this film, I could tolerate Kidman, but never thought she was anything above a mediocre actress.  She always played a kind of ""ice queen"" in her films, with average results.  In Moulin Rouge however, she literally blossoms.  She proves that she can play comedy, tragedy and even sing fairly well in the course of one film.  I've always liked MacGregor, who has shown a lot of versatility in his films which have been of the independent genre for the most part.  Roxborough is both hilarious and frightening as the controlling Duke, and Jim Broadbent is absolutely amazing as Harold Zidler, the Emcee of the Moulin Rouge and father figure to Satine.  Other than Kidman's performance, I would wager that John Leguizamo as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is the best example of casting against type.  Historically, Toulouse-Lautrec was an extremely tragic figure, and the film, while giving us the free-spirit elements to his character, also subtlety explores his darker side as well.The biggest star of Moulin Rouge however is the director, Baz Luhrmann. While I did not particularly like his first film, Strictly Ballroom, I did appreciate the colorful set designs he employed.  I feel he sharpened his vision in his second film, Romeo & Juliet, and then achieved perfection in this film.  There is so much to appreciate:  The use of sharp colors, the fantastical elements, the innovative cinematography and slick camera angles. The use of modern music to tell a story of life 100 years ago was daring, but I feel it fit into the film amazingly well.  Luhrmann has become one of those directors that I will definitely seek out, regardless of the subject matter because I know that the production values will be more than worth the price of admission.**Possible Spoiler Alert**I watched this film with a friend who was really into the movie but ended up assessing that she didn't like it because she didn't like the ending since it bummed her out.  You are told the ending within the first 5 minutes of the film, but that doesn't prepare you for the scene when it is actually acted out.  In his last two films, Baz Luhrmann has pretty much made a habit of riding you on an emotional roller coaster - you feel happy when the characters are happy and even a cynical person like me was into the romantic story because it was so convincingly played out.  I like to liken what happens next with his films as ""getting hit by a truck, then run over repeatedly.""  He brings you to an emotional high and then pretty much crushes you, even though you knew what was coming.  I have seen this movie about 5 times now and I was still bawling at several points in the film. 
So if you're looking for a pick me up and you want to see a great romantic comedy, this one is probably not the one you want for that mood.  But if you are looking for a well-rounded film that is visually shocking and brilliantly enacted and directed, this is a must see.  It is definitely one of my favorites of this century and still my pick for Best Picture of 2001.--Shelly",Moulin Rouge!
105,gelman@attglobal.net,Divided Reactions to Moulin Rouge,9,31 January 2005,"The ratings posted on IMDb for Moulin Rouge are something of a surprise. People I know loved or hated this film in about equal numbers. And I mean REALLY loved or REALLY hated. If the pattern on IMDb were the same as the one I found among friends, there would have been clusters in the 8-10 and 1-3 range and very little in between. For those looking for guidance, you need to understand that everything about Moulin Rouge is exaggerated. You can go with the flow and enjoy the film (as I did) or you can compare it to more conventional movie musicals and despise it. For those who liked the movie, the lead review on this site has it exactly right. But you can also turn the comments around, view them from the other end, and understand why a lot of people disliked everything about the film for pretty much the same set of reasons. I can't really think of another movie ever that inspired such different reactions based on identical factors.",Moulin Rouge!

This is very entertaining movie.Nicole Kidman is superb as Satine. She's surrounded by good actors and funny characters. What about Ziddler, and Toulouse-Lautrec!!! The sets are enchanting. It's like a big fairy tale. Funny the gun that klinks on the Eiffel tower! Of course, there's a lot of clichés («I'm dying Christian») but who cares, it's made up to be that way. Parody of musicals but also of classic litterature. Funny to use songs like Madonna's «Like a Virgin» in a movie about a nightclub in 1899 in Paris, France! Great songs, well chosen. I enjoy myself very much at this movie. I like the way the movie begin and finish with the curtain and the orchestra conductor. The entire generic is nice too.Out of 100, I gave it 83.

109,EijnarAmadeus,"'We are creatures of the underworld, we can not afford to love. The show must go on.'",7,27 October 2008,"MOULIN ROUGE! is visually spectacular, and the movie floats away on a childishly whimsical tune with Paris as a backdrop, and is truly an adventurous ride. Director Baz Luhrmann uses the MTV-technique of his Romeo+Juliet with even more extravagance and fun, and like fireworks the scenes are glazing with pop-music references (the 'Like a Prayer' turn is especially amusing), fairy-tale love and temptations.And 2 hours with THIS kind of dancing, singing and emotions is almost a gay-ish blast, with its great choreography and cinematography - and in the beautiful Paris you'll be drawn down to Moulin Rouge's atmosphere were sparks fly with decadence and lust. Ewan McGregor is the angel-innocence in a world of sin (according to his father), and he's a hero wherever he sets his foot, but slips into sorrow and depression over his love's (Nicole Kidman) death. A death birthed by Moulin Rouge's tireless demands, a life where she's worth whatever a customer would pay for her.The first act is a blast of humorous editing, colorful cinematography and surely a crazy Jim Broadbent, but the slow-paced scenes of Christian (McGregor) and Satine (Kidman), in the second and third act, clearly states a pure love, and the carefully directed scenes of Kidman alone gives a feeling that the tragedy is within reach. It's a surprisingly emotionally powerful movie, and the earlier, sprouting tunes turns into something darker, as Sting's 'Roxanne' becomes McGregor's earnest, jealous and cry-out for Satine to leave her Moulin-Rouge-life behind, and the roller-coaster introduction simply en-powers its drama as Jim Broadbent tells her Satine; ""We are creatures of the underworld, we can not afford to love. The Show Must Go On."", and suddenly this tragic fairy-tale has got a meaning and message.",Moulin Rouge!
110,grahamsj3,Not bad,7,8 March 2004,"This is an interesting film, set in the early 20th century but using late 20th century music. Starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, both prove that they can carry a tune. Neither is a great singer but both do well enough. Once the film gets started, it can hold the viewer's interest pretty well. The story has been reviewed several times over by others so I'll not go into it much here, but suffice it to say it's a musical that's mainly a love story. It has elements of comedy and tragedy but doesn't completely fit in either genre. There is an underlying theme, which is ""the show must go on"" as well as the main love story. All in all, pretty good!",Moulin Rouge!

112,FloatingOpera7,Pop Opera Musical Of The Highest Calibre,10,14 February 2005,"Director Baz Luhrman completes his Red Curtain Trilogy (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet) with Moulin Rouge, released in 2001. It is an combination of theatrical and musical forms coming together in harmony to produce a moving romantic tragedy. It's also an attempt to bring back the musical film genre, which has been lost since the days of ""My Fair Lady"" ""The Sound of Music"", ""Camelot"" and ""Oliver,"" all of which were made into musicals in the 60's. True, many people object to musicals on screen. They seem to want it to remain strictly on stage. As of late, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom Of the Opera was released in theaters starring Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum in a Joel Schumacher film. Chicago won Best Picture in 2003. It's hard to say what it is Hollywood wants, really. Musicals on film are just as dramatic and powerful as any straightforward drama. While Moulin Roug does go over-the-top at times and the performances are throwbacks to operatic convention -boy meets girl, they fall in love, villain wants the girl for himself, girl dies, this can still work if the movie has a certain magic touch and Moulin Rouge has this. It's a great film with easy accessibility by a young MTV-fed audience. The songs featured within the plot are Elton John's ""Your Song"", Whitney Houston's ""I will Always Love You"" ""Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong"" ""Silly Love Songs"" and seemingly all the most memorable love songs of the 20th century. In addition, pop numbers by Madonna ""Like A Virgin"" and the new version of Patti Labelle's ""Lady Marmalade"" sung by Missy Elliot, Christina Aguilera and Lil' Kim. The dance sequences during the ""Sultan and Courtesan"" opera which mirror the plight of Satine and Christian, was modeled after choreographed Baliwood musical dances. It is quite desperate in its attempt to kick in the new 21st century musical but it works, mainly because of the strong leads. Nicole Kidman as the tragic, La Traviata type heroine Satine, a courtesan for the eponymous nightclub, is doing a terrific performance. Furthermore, it's quite different from her normally serious work as an actress. She's really having fun with this character, especially in the ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" number. She sang using her own voice, too. Ewan Mcgreggor plays her true love, the poet Christian. He is sensitive, warm and artsy in the role, and again, he is using his own voice. Baz Luhrman may have already conceived the idea for staging ""La Boheme"" which hit theaters only about a year later. The scenery and art direction was modeled after the Montmartre that is used in Moulin Rouge. The voice of tenor Placido Domingo was used as the Man In The Moon, a little bit of trivia for you opera fans.",Moulin Rouge!
113,raymond-15,A dazzling melodrama,9,24 June 2001,"This film sets your head spinning with its noisy opening, its brilliant colours which burst like rockets on to the screen and the masterful camera work which lifts you up over the roof tops of Paris and propels you through the doors of the celebrated Moulin Rouge.  It is like nothing you have seen before.  A truly new cinematic experience.  Amongst all the fanciful Mont Martre characters - almost grotesque at times- runs a simple love story of Satine, the top star of the Moulin Rouge who is torn between wealth and security offered by a duke and the promise of love by a penniless writer of poetry.  What surprises me most is the comedy.  Somehow I did not expect it. An hilarious scene (there were many) was the secret meeting of Satine, the prostitute (Nicole Kidman) with Christian the poet (Ewan McGregor). She thought he wanted sex when he was simply determined to read her one of his poems.  The clever mingling of well-known songs (quite out of the period of 1900) linked the scenes with amazing effect.   At one moment it was the Sound of Music, at another a suggestion of Gilbert and Sullivan- a mad mixture of songs, but it worked and oh so well. I found myself enjoying every moment of this intricate weaving of songs. This film has all the elements of a great production.  It will never cease to amaze me how Baz Lurhmann could assemble such a wild lot of characters and bring them together in such a frenzy of sheer entertainment.  By the way, don't forget to take your handkerchief.",Moulin Rouge!
114,tomimt,"Spectacular, spectacular",9,28 February 2005,"Mouling Rogue! is, at this moment, best movie that Baz Luhrmann has made. Romeo+Juliet was visually very similar, but it did lack the continuity of Moulin Rgue!. Whole fairy tale like feeling of the story makes this movie more enjoyable to watch.I am not huge fan of musicals, but I must confess that I adore Moulin Rogue. It has much to do with familiar songs that have been rearranged to fit in the musical pieces of the story. Many who have seen this movie pick out the wonderful tango version of The Police son Roxanne, but my personal favorites are wonderful adaptation of Madonna's Like A virgin and Queen's Show Must go On. But there are many others as well, whole movie is a fireworks of visual and musical candy.Whole movie is filled with fantastic actors. Ewan Mcgregor does mans work as Christian, a romantic, who fells in love radiant Moulin Rogue courtesan Satine, played Nicole Kidman, who has never looked more stunning. Richard Roxburgh as the Duke is wonderfully sleazy and disgusting villain, bringing great contrast against naive Christian.I could go on and on.

117,Movie-12,"One of the few movies out there worth watching several times, just because of the sheer visual and musical enchantment. **** (out of four)",10,16 June 2001,"MOULIN ROUGE! / (2001) **** (out of four)By Blake French:	""Moulin Rouge!"" revives our imagination and relives the musical era of Hollywood. The film is like an extravagant, expensive Broadway production on screen, with enough open courage, engrossing passion, and zesty energy for several motion pictures. It's one of the year's best films; ""Moulin Rouge!"" may be a cliché-ridden love triangle, but Baz Luhrmann, the film's director, shines a fresh, stunning originality on a familiar plot. He creates a candid, exuberant style for his characters-a mixture between a fast-paced music video and lush, exotic images. He uses a vast variety of camera placements and shooting angles. In several of the songs, he cuts on nearly every word. This does indeed make us dizzy, but it is the perfect approach to the material. 	From the opening moments, ""Moulin Rouge!"" plays full force, overpowering our senses. The film doesn't even wait for its opening credits to begin. The usual 20th Century Fox logo appears on the screen within a screen as a little bald musician rises from the bottom, and continues to frantically conduct the traditional Fox fanfare. From this, we cut to ""The Sound of Music,"" where young writer morns over the loss of his true love. The film includes an interesting use of the bookend structure, and I like how it reveals the information about the main character's deadly disease early. This is the kind of movie that does not need to astonish us with sudden plot twists or unexpected character revelations. The joy of watching ""Moulin Rouge!"" is in the visual stimulation; the plot is more interested in its own character's discoveries than playing mind games with the audience.
	Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they can really sing. Most of the time, celebrity singers turn to the silver screen with a lot of star power but little acting ability. Look at LL Cool J, Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, and I just know Brittany Spears is going to turn up in a movie one of these days. ""Moulin Rouge"" may be one of the first movies to open musical doors for its leading performers. Even Jim Broadbent proves to be well cast in a crazy, intensified character that he really sinks his teeth into. I will never look at any of these stars in the same light again, even, to my great reluctance, John Leguizamo.The film takes place in the early 19th century, as Christian (McGregor) enters Paris hoping to write love stories. Several peculiar figures live above him, including the French artist Toulouse-Lautrec (Leguizamo) and his Bohemian troupe attempting to construct a play. After a freak accident, Christian is suddenly thrust into the middle of their play. The crew hires him as the star writer. He then takes a visit to the flirtatious Moulin Rouge night club, ran by the robust Harold Zinder (Jim Broadbent). It is here where he tries to persuade the club's popular, sexy lead performer and courtesan, Satine (Kidman), to work in their production.
	After mistaking Christian for a rich and powerful aristocrat, The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), Satine falls in love with Christian, much to the dismay of many. However, she believes herself to be a simple prostitute, who should never fall in love because it will get in the way of success. When the Duke agrees to produce a major production at the Moulin Rogue, but only under his circumstances, things become even more complicated. The Duke demands that Satine becomes his personal property if Harold and the others want his financial support. Obviously, the best thing in ""Moulin Rouge!"" is the music. Apart from the cast, the film's big list of musical artists includes David Bowe, Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink, Fatboy Slim, Beck, and many others. The kind of music that plays here does not account for a period epic at all, however. ""Moulin Rouge!"" doesn't try to be a historic depiction, but instead an expression of fantasy and passion. The elegant sets, eventful style, and powerful choreography scream modern day, post-pop-culture. I ran out to purchase the motion picture soundtrack. You should, too. But listening to the soundtrack on your CD player at home is nothing like experiencing the memorable singing and dancing, sexual energy, and relentless enthusiasm on the big screen.
As I say in very few film critiques, some movies are you watch, others you experience. ""Moulin Rouge"" is an experience not to be missed. It is a bizarre, unique blend of exhaustive energy and lively action-one of the bravest, most ambitious and entertaining movies of the year.",Moulin Rouge!

119,FlickJunkie-2,A brilliant symphony of incongruities,10,3 January 2002,"My reaction to the first 15 minutes of this film was, `Oh, no.  This is going to be a two hour music video, and from the looks of it, it is going to be like MTV on LSD.'  I actually shut it off and went to bed.  I returned the next day and vowed to keep my personal policy never to leave any movie unfinished, no matter how much I dislike it.  I'm glad I have that policy because wow, was my first impression wrong.Baz Luhrmann has delivered us a piece of filmmaking genius with this avant-garde film.  It combines disparate elements that seem incompatible, yet they work magnificently together.  Music video style is combined with the moorings of the traditional theatrical musical to create a piece that is simultaneously revolutionary and old guard.This film is about incongruity.  Modern popular music is woven into a turn of the century story.  The sets, lighting and costumes are designed to create garish color clashes.  The presentation is sometimes camp comedy and at others very straightforward and melodramatic.  Normally, none of these elements work together, but Luhrmann orchestrates them into a symphony of visual and auditory harmony that is nothing short of overwhelming.The story itself is nothing special.  It is an old fashioned tragic love story where true love is pitted against practical realities.  The impoverished writer (Ewan McGregor) loves the courtesan (Nicole Kidman) and she loves him, but the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) desires her and will stop at nothing to get her.  She promises to be with the Duke, and he agrees to fund the `Spectacular Spectacular', refurbishing the Moulin Rouge for the event and promising to make her a great star.  She agrees but continues to dally with the writer behind the Duke's back.  Of course, this leads to a confrontation where she must decide between true love and great wealth.The music is outstanding.  The arrangements of familiar pop songs as well as the original music are fantastically done.  The dance and choreography are Broadway quality.  The costumes and sets are, well, Spectacular.  The presentation is sometimes zany and at other times solemn, but always entertaining.  While Luhrmann may not have redefined the movie musical, he has certainly expanded its limits by a couple of galaxies.  In many ways it reminds me of the kind of effect shows like `Jesus Christ Superstar' and `The Wiz' had on theater, taking risks to go to irreverent places and traverse unspoken boundaries.The acting is terrific.  Ewan McGregor continues to expand his considerable acting talents into new and varied areas, and with each new project shows his adaptability and facility.  In addition to giving a gut wrenching performance as the forlorn writer he also shows a reasonably good singing voice.  However, as good as McGregor is, he is blown off the set by Nicole Kidman.  Kidman astounds with powerful vocals of recording artist caliber that literally raise goose flesh.  Her acting is multi-textured with amazing range, handling the comedy, the romance and the tragedy with equal aplomb. This is by far her best performance and her shining moment.  Jim Broadbent is phenomenal as the over-the-top owner and ringmaster of the legendary night spot.  The entire cast (especially the dancers) delivers a high energy performance.This film is a treat for anyone who loves theater, popular music, great dance and an old fashioned love story.  I rated it a 10/10.  Yes, it is sappy and silly and overly melodramatic, but it is done with style . . . Spectacularly!",Moulin Rouge!

121,khatcher-2,Pleases the pop-corn public,2,20 August 2005,"Put a couple of ""beautiful people"" together in a romantic fantasy musical rather like in a modernised version of anything by Rogers and Hammerstein, lots of songs all strung along any-old-how, with a story-line which doesn't matter, and box-office success is assured and everyone is HAPPY! Great show-biz, but dismal film-making; about as original as a cold pizza on a park bench in the bleak mid winter, and throwing in a handful of snow - whether artificial or not - makes no difference. Supposedly Paris in the early 1900s but laden with songs from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, with anything - but ANYTHING - from Dolly Parton to Sting, passing through Buffy Sainte-Marie and Elton John and a bit of Lennon/McCartney - and throwing in for good measure the only pieces to have existed then from Offenbach (which must have had Les Folies Bergères splitting their sides and gurgling with mirth backstage), this film lurches along in a frivolous capriccio accompanied by lurid overblown photography.Spectacular show, but pretty lousy film-making. The only good thing going for it was that it did not have Richard Gere (who probably can't sing) and Jennifer López (who can), or, even worse pairing up somebody like the unbearable Keanu Reeves with Shannon Elisabeth.I give ""Moulin Rouge"" just under three out of ten as some of the songs were ""nice"" and at times were cleverly strung together.

122,museumofdave,"A Dazzling Film That Can Irritate Or Amaze, Entertain or Repel",7,23 May 2013,"By reading all the varied opinions of the effect this film has on viewers, one can easily deduce it's power to attract or repel, depending on the viewer's cultural background--do you want a film that pushes the envelope or a more traditional take, well-made but linear? Moulin Rouge is in no way traditional, and therein lies it's strength for many viewers, perhaps especially for those raised on television commercials and the toys of instant communication, where a frequent change of focus is stimulating rather than irritating.As with Director Luhrmann's recent Gatsby film, the style here is the primary substance, a delirious mix of color, sound and attitude in brilliant color that never lets a moment go by without a camera zoom or background flourish; the first time I watched this strange amalgam of red and gold curtained style, I was ready for a Tylenol, mainly because I wanted some sort of coherent plot, some feeling to hang on to--every time Luhrmann hooks the viewer into an emotional moment, he whips it into something else entirely, like throwing 237 vivid MTV shorts into a blender and churning it on crumble: the second time I watched it merely for the sensual thrills (as the plot is high-school simple) and enjoyed the ride. There is little doubt that Luhrmann is able to make a dazzling film, but whether he delivers any kind of depth in human relationships or feeling is another matter entirely.",Moulin Rouge!

Cool and intentionally fake-looking sets - check.  Decent script - erm, pass.  ""Moulin Rouge!"" indulges in silly romantic cliches on purpose, because there seems to be some unwritten law that all musicals have to be superficial and shallow love stories.  Shame it didn't really try to improve the formula.  If you think that hearing someone croon ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn...is to LOVE...and be LOVED...in RETURN!"" is real deep and touching, then you might get something out of this.  If, like me, you think it's mindless drivel, all style and no substance, and a whooping Nicole Kidman annoys you...avoid.",Moulin Rouge!

The mayor wanted him birthed at this performance so it would be the first thing he saw. And from there on he was to be raised and trained by the robots. They had of course stated (in this documentary film) that 1941 was the year things like this started to be allowed. So film maker 'Ronald gear' wanted to show us what happened with Max rose (portrayed by Ewan). Training for Max began from birth, from there on he stayed moving in a bus. The trainer robots arrived on and left the bus, taking different shifts. Some were nicer to max: those who chilled a portion of his mind and affixed a cardboard box over his eyesight which contained a scene of the night sky and a glowing moon. Then there were the nasty robots who worked Max to the extreme, at one point in this documentary he was slapped in the thigh by one of them. Maxes stage performance meant bench pressing a water melon and then suddenly stopping to relax his body and facial expressions, completely. The play was about life and death, that's what max was trained for.",Moulin Rouge!
125,Antagonisten,Frantic,5,21 February 2005,"I hate musicals. Well, not all of them but almost. That's also why i put off watching this one for years. Simply because i didn't think i could possibly enjoy it. And did i? Well. Let's see.Baz Luhrmann has made the more or less ""hysterical"" film-making his thing. And this is certainly quite hysterical. The pace is admirably high throughout, but also skillfully kept at a level where we still have energy to keep watching. Luhrmanns feeling for visuals and audio is impeccable. Making this an experience that assaults the senses in a very dramatic way. I must admit though that even though the movie seemed to do everything available to keep the viewers interest up, the frantic pace got the best of me in the end. The last 15-20 minutes were rather painfully prolonged.So what about the music? This is a musical after all. Well, the songs were quite sing-a-long friendly. I felt like breaking out singing myself several times. Especially when hearing the sometimes quite painfully weak voice of Ewan McGregor. Maybe it was not THAT bad, but i was not impressed. Otherwise the singing as well as the picking of music was top-notch. A lot of classic songs that might not fit that well into the 1900's Paris, but perfectly into the burlesque mood of the film, mixed nicely with brand new material.So, what's the verdict. Well i must say this movie was not really for me. While i enjoyed it more than your typical musical it was still just too frantic and bizarre for my tastes. The acting was OK and the music was great, but still it's too much for me. I guess many people love this, but i give it an average rating. Knowing that my taste is the real problem here. 5/10.",Moulin Rouge!
126,EmperorNortonII,Ooh La La!,9,10 June 2001,"""Moulin Rouge"" is truly a feast for the eyes and ears.  It's very visual and colorful, showing the famed Moulin Rouge club as a sort of Studio 54 of 19th-century Paris.  Baz Luhrmann makes excellent use of imagery, even in the 20th Century Fox logo!  One thing I liked was when familiar lyrics creep into the dialogue, and then you're set up for a musical number, just like Jim Broadbent's rendition of ""Like a Virgin.""  Part of the fun of ""Moulin Rouge"" is identifying the songs you hear!  And John Leguizamo was hilarious as Henri Toulouse-Lautrec!  He does his role well, and convincingly.  His legs are more believable than his nose!  Anyway, the whole film has the visual punch of a dose of absinthe.  The bohemian lifestyle was never so fantastic!",Moulin Rouge!
127,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: perfect romance, musical",10,30 November 2002,"I was put off by the promotions for Moulin Rouge! thinking that the film would be too surreal and weird for me. But it comes across as a musical that's quite interesting and without as many weird segues. You know what I'm talking about; in most musicals the dialogue is going along just fine and then somebody suddenly breaks into song for no reason. Well, in Moulin Rouge it's well-integrated, and the plot is just surreal enough to be arty and interesting without spoiling the mood or becoming campy.For example, the racy modern music they play at the burlesque gives us a feeling of what it might have been like to hear what was considered racy music at the turn of the century. The romance is compelling and sweet, and there are plenty of deep thoughts about the nature of what it means to be human, and to fall in love. It brought tears to my eyes, and that's very rare for me -- I'm hardly a weepy at the films.Who should see this film:-- Romantic comedy lovers -- a must-see, although expect a lot more romance than comedy-- People who are musical -- a must-see-- Everybody elseI'll give this film a sensational 10 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!
128,asda-man,A sparkawing diamond!,10,10 August 2011,"Now I understand that some people simply won't ""get"" ""Moulin Rouge"" as it is the definition of a marmite film. You will either completely hate everything about it or absolutely love it and watch it all the time. Unfortunately for me I'm the latter half, I love ""Moulin Rouge"" and although slightly flawed, I still have to give a complete 10 out of 10 just simply for its uniqueness and watch-ability factor. Heres more reasons why I love it.The story itself is very simple and text-book for a romantic musical. It's very similar to Baz's version of ""Romeo + Juliet"" because it's about forbidden love. However believe or not, ""Moulin Rouge"" has even more style and is 10x more outrageous and fun! What it lacks in complexity it gains in sheer originality. The first thing that will strike anyone is the incredible visuals that Baz puts in from the very start. It looks absolutely amazing and is a masterclass in how to use sight and sound. The cinematography is really top-notch and awe-inspiring. this is why blu-ray was invented!Baz's directing is outstanding! The first 20 minutes or so are incredibly fast-paced and may put some people off, but it's important to keep with it because it does slow down a little. Everything is completely put on top gear and it's brilliant! The way the film uses modern day songs for a late 1800's style setting is pure genius, and you just get really into the songs and the music. ""Moulin Rouge"" could be described as one long music video which may put some people off. But not me! The film is also really funny as well and uses slapstick cartoonish humour to motor along lovely. Richard Roxborough (not sure how to spell it) as The Duke was a delight, his rendition of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" has me in stitches every time! Jim Broadbeny as ""Ziddler"" also impresses and goes brilliantly with the over the top style of the film. Let's make this clear that no one can actually sing. Ewan thinks he can get away with just shouting all the time and Nicole can't hit the high notes and usually gets away with it by fainting just before she hits them. But even so, you will find your spine tingling with the incredible music that bellows on the screen.The final scene is really inventive and always gives me chills. ""Moulin Rouge"" will make you laugh and possibly make you cry (I didn't because I'm a big boy!) What's certain is that you will be singing along to all your favourite songs (even if it is in your head). ""Moulin Rouge"" is best enjoyed with the sound cranked all the way up and probably best seen in blu-ray quality. Just open up your mind and enjoy the incredible visuals, directing and sound. If you watch it for the first time, there's a very strong chance that you will watch it at least 5 more times!",Moulin Rouge!

His movie was a pistache of bits put together leaving me wondering why I'm bothering to watch this story that seems to be going in so many directions.

I guess I like Moulin Rouge since it's so crazy that the singing doesn't seem as unnatural as in other films.Moulin Rouge is first and foremost a feast for the eyes. The production design is spectacular as is the costume design. The visual effects are brilliant. It's colourful and dazzling. It feels original. The premise of the movie is not original at all, a classic story of doomed love. For once, though, I didn't think about the fact that the premise is so archetypical, I was too busy watching the screen.Both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, as well as most of the supporting players, are brilliant.

135,chrisbrown6453,Unlike any movie you'll ever see.,10,8 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a refreshing change to the action, comedy, horror, and romantic genres that we are used to these days.  It's unique style of directing and cinematography is second to none.  I cannot put into words how stylish this movie really plays out on the screen.Moulin Rouge tells the story of a young writer who moves to Paris with plans of writing his best piece of work and finding love.  Upon arriving, he sits to write and realizes that he has the worst case of writer's block ever. This started a chain reaction of very unusual events that would change his life. He is thrust into using his poetic talent to write a play entitled `Spectacular, Spectacular!'Ewan McGregor is indeed spectacular as Christian, the love-hunting writer. He is great in this role, and who would have guessed that he could sing; not well, but he tried.  I have seen McGregor perform miracles in everything from Shallow Grave' to Star Wars: Episode I' to perhaps his now second greatest performance in Trainspotting', but his performance in Moulin Rouge is nothing less than wonderful.Nicole Kidman plays the seductive `Sparkling Diamond', Satine, a woman paid to make men believe she loves them.  She mistakenly believes Christian to be a Duke she wants to seduce so he will finance her budding acting career, only to end up falling in love with the penniless writer.  Kidman's performance is very good, and she sings rather well.  Watching Kidman play, and I mean play in every sense of the word, in this movie was a delight. Her ability to make the audience laugh was a skill I didn't know she possessed.  Finally, John Leguizamo has not been this funny since The Pest.'  He is certainly a forgotten funnyman in Hollywood (To Wong Foo comes to mind). His character in Moulin Rouge, Toulouse, is absolutely indescribable! 
While many might think Moulin Rouge is a musical, let it be known that it is not merely a musical, but one could say it creates a whole new genre.  I have been known to despise musicals, especially Disney Masterpieces, but Moulin Rouge is different.  Moulin Rouge is a nice refreshing change to the all too familiar explosions, jokes, and love stories that are virtually force-fed to us in films lately. Not that I mind movies like `Armageddon', `Star Wars', and `The Rock', but getting ready for a summer full of action blockbusters such as `Tomb Raider', `Planet of the Apes', and the much anticipated `Jurassic Park 3'will be much easier thanks to the blissful Moulin Rouge.",Moulin Rouge!
136,bsinc,Terrible trumpery,4,29 April 2002,"Renting this crap was a huge mistake. What was I thinking. I totally hated ""Romeo & Juliet"", and this looked even worse in the trailers. Plus the ever so annoying ""Lady Marmelade"". Uuuugggggghhhh. Well I rented it because I was curious. My parents saw it in the cinema and they said they'd had walked out after 10 minutes if they hadn't been sitting in the middle of the row. And then there was this friend of mine that said ""Moulin Rouge"" was the greatest movie ever made. HA I admit my parents are no Siskel & Ebert (not that they were any better), for example they hated ""The Godfather"" and thought ""The Lord Of The Rings"" was boring and unrealistic. Yeah! Anyway, I was faced with a dilemma. Believe my parents or a guy that once engraved a cross on his hand with a pencil. Not that other's opinions count, not by far, but I just had to see this movie, curiosity u see.The only solution was to rent the movie.Who said that curiosity was a good thing. After seeing this movie I can say that IGNORANCE IS BLISS!!!! It starts of funny with that man conducting to the 20th century fox opening theme. But as soon as the movie picks up the pace and blasts you into a Luhrmann vison of the France during 1900 you get the general idea. Fast and awkward editing spoils, no, destroys a nice concept to revive a little piece of music and bring it to the big screen in style.This movie could have easily been stupendous and could singlehandedly bring back the zhanra of musicals. Instead I was left with the feeling that it was made very poorly, most of the sets were awful, and there was that dreadful windmill that got more screen time that most of the actors. Besides the first five minutes there's nothing to like about this movie except the somewhat good performance by Nicole Kidman. She definitely has her moments and was the only reason why I didn't push the ""STOP"" button on the remote control. Still, what demon possessed her to star in this one. Ewan McGregor, showing off his pearly yellowies, was watchable but in my opinion miscast. The others aren't worth talking about.It's not easy to make a musical that has a terrible sound track. Baz Luhrmann, I salute you. To shamelessly make use of many great songs and not make a single one sound even half as good as the original, now that takes true talent.A love story that is predictable and makes very little sense since Satine falls in love with Christian after he sings her a song. Is that all it takes, a song. C'mon, here we have a curtisan who daily plays with men for money and as soon as one of them breaks a base she's swept off her feet. The movie gets so boring in the 2nd half I started feeling a little masochistic, but I had to see the ending. All I can say is that nominating this movie for anything besides the ""Razzies"" is ludicrous and insulting to movies. Because this is nothing short of a really bad play, and that's where it should belong, on a rotting stage in bloody England. Don't get me wrong, it's not really that bad, it's just that the director is soooo much worse. I have to commend Mr. Luhrmann, for he has again surprised and amazed me with his lack of style, taste and colors.Congratulations.Without doubt the worst musical ever made.           3/10",Moulin Rouge!
137,PyrolyticCarbon,"An innovative film, and very enjoyable, when the story actually begins.",7,13 September 2002,"There has been much hype about this film, especially from friends, and I was very excited to see it, especially at the prospect of hearing Ewan McGregor sing! I must say however, that I was disappointed. I was told this is probably the film of the year, and it certainly is not, with the first half lacking direction and substance, merely a collection of big show scenes that seemed to be included for all lovers of musicals and stage shows. Hence why my friends loved it!At this point I must say that I am not a great fan of Baz Luhrmanns' Romeo and Juliet. The only real part I liked was the portrayal of the rival families. To me it seemed like an extended MTV music video. So this probably clouded my judgement somewhat.Saying that, once a semblance of a story begins, it begins to seem like a film, and a wonderfully entertaining one at that. To me, the two actors who shine through are Ewan McGregor, showing that he is truly a versatile actor, and Richard Roxburgh who plays the most fantastic baddie I've seen since Charles Dance.The music sequences are brilliant, and when the characters start speaking lines from songs, that added a nice touch to the film, especially since it's something all my friends do anyway!When the plot does kick in, it kicks in quickly, and although it's a simple story of love, it's well acted, scripted and directed, with the most amazing musical sequences.An innovative film, and very enjoyable, when the story begins.",Moulin Rouge!
138,TaylorYee94,Marvelous musical with magical mise-en-scene,10,12 January 2021,"Masterpiece. Every factor that makes up the movie, story, acting, costume, set design, lighting, camera walk, and music, is just the state of the art. The greatest show one can realize on the screen.First, cinematography is the beginning and the end of this movie. The reddish and pinkish fairy lights intensifies love and the romance between Satine and Christian. Without this color scheme in the background, their love is not sketched as beautiful as it is on the screen. Lighting is appropriately used to create certain atmosphere. For example, the lighting of the can-can performance in Moulin Rouge is too bright, rather flashy, but 'El Tango de Roxanne' and Satine & the Duke in the tower scene is so dark that it emanates gloomy and dreary atmosphere. Additionally, the camera walk in the beginning is turbulent to add the feeling of disorganization and boheme of that place and of that time. To be honest, every scene from any angle is not only picturesque but also purposeful.Second, costumes and set design creates fairy tale ambiance. The play about Indian courtesan is an excellent choice because colors in Indian clothes are various and pop, so the stage in Moulin Rouge at the ending can be splendid and colorful as it can be. What I love the most about the set design is elephant room, the room only possible in fairy tale. This alluring, bohemian, and glamorous room shows how much effort the art director puts in the movie. All the props are set to the detail to show who 'Satine' is. Satine's costumes changes from red in the beginning to white in the end. She is a passionate, brave, and independent performer who aspires to be an actress, and red surely represents her character well enough. It also symbolizes romance, infatuation, and physical love Satine may feel toward Christian at first. Her clothes change to white at the ending. White signifies more of pure love and devotion, and this change shows how deep her love is toward Christian. Oh, and her costume including what looks like wedding dress, sparkly jewelry, and her make-up turns her into 'human diamond' as Harold has stated. She just shines. She is wonderfully beautiful, and every audience falls in love with her.All these components can dazzle because the story is solid. The director has a simple but dramatic story line and makes it way more compelling by aforementioned devices. 'Mouline Rouge!' is a great love story.

139,dead47548,Dazzling.,9,8 January 2008,"I think that dazzling would be the best word to describe this film. Everything about it is just visually pleasing from the set designs to the beautiful costumes. The idea of adding unique flare to classic songs (i.e. ""Heroes"") really made me adore all of the musical numbers. For the most part, the charisma and eccentric nature of the film was hilarious and a joy to watch. However there were certain points, mostly in the first half, that were a little bit too out there for me to enjoy and ended up distracting me from the film as a whole. A lot of the film was really cheeky and sometimes that worked, but sometimes it turned me off. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both give absolutely phenomenal performances (the best I've seen from both of them), doing an outstanding job of combining emotional range with drama, musical talent and very charismatic charm. I loved watching them throughout. The story has been done many times before, but it felt really fresh for some reason, maybe that had to do with the overwhelming charisma. I can't get over how fun it was to watch McGregor. Overall, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would and it's certainly one of the best of 2001.",Moulin Rouge!
140,charchuk,My favourite musical,8,30 August 2007,"Generally speaking, I don't like musicals. Mostly because of the songs. The two main exceptions are Singin' in the Rain and Grease, both of which are incredibly fun with very catchy songs. For the most part, though, I can't stand the genre, especially the recent flux of them of which this film is the catalyst. But, after hearing all the raves for this one, I decided to give it a go. It wasn't my type of movie, and I loved it.The interesting thing is, if this film hadn't been a musical, I doubt I would have liked it as much. Sure, the direction is innovative and the acting is impressive, but it's the numerous medleys of contemporary songs that really made this for me. Going in, I was under the impression that this was going to be like every other musical  songs written directly for it. Little did I know that David Bowie, The Police, Queen, and even Nirvana were all represented in various shapes and forms. I absolutely loved the way in which a vast variety of songs were covered, interpreted, and woven together to create instantly memorable tunes. My favourite? Definitely ""El Tango de Roxanne"", but I enjoyed everything else as well.Of course, that's not the only highlight of the film. The incredible visual and directing style is unlike anything I've seen in a film of this sort before. In fact, it's really unmatched in cinema in general. The acting is very good, as the stars manage to create three-dimensional characters while also having great singing voices. The story is a brilliant mishmash of doomed romance, slapstick comedy, and even historical drama. The slapstick routine at the beginning crackles with terrific comic energy, and the whole film is incredibly vivid and alive.I have to say this is one of the biggest surprises for me as a moviegoer. A musical romance, two of my least favourite genres, that produced a hit song which I loathe, and I ended up loving the film. Go figure.",Moulin Rouge!

Compelling, spellbinding and very, very funny. The story, otherwise crippled by sentimentality and awful cheesiness, is brought to its feet by this enormous mass of motion. Ol' Paris anno 1899 is brought to scandalous life and the drinking of Absinthe is glorified by the absinthe fairy, Kylie Minogue.

Baz does something strange, he brings us back in the early 1900 namely in the decadent Paris at where we are invited to the strangest parties at Le Moulin Rouge. This is a musical that's never been done before, as even if we are hundred years back we hear modern popsongs (Bowie, Madonna, Nirvana) performed in a pure Broadwaystyle and it works splendid. It tells us the impossible story of a poor novelist who has to win a dancer Nicole Kidman who is destinated to sell her body, and for the sake of the Moulin Rouge she must marry the evil duke who put all his money in the cabaret.

The overly surreal director has ruined the world of films with his dreadful ""Red Curtain"" trilogy, a trifecta of nauseatingly colorful and gapingly overdone ""films"" that pass for art fare in a world where ""Sin City"" is considered Oscar material. ""Moulin Rouge"" is a peculiar musical which incorporates an abysmal story with the anachronistic use of several popular 20th-century songs-- a feat which we're supposed to view as genius. Sadly, the songs are terrible. With, that is, the exception of ""Roxanne,"" which is horrifyingly mangled in a performance by a man who desperately needs to clear his throat.

The story is like a jukebox containing many incredible songs from our time, and transports it into a world where love is more powerful than anything else in the whole wide world. So, let me just say this, and I'm not afraid to admit it. ""Moulin Rouge"" is one of the most heartbreaking movies I have ever seen, and it almost made me cry my guts out. From the powerful music, the neat cinematography and editing, to the elegant sets and costumes, ""Moulin Rouge"" is a marvelous musical containing everything. The casting ensemble was also brilliant, with a list containing Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, and Richard Roxburgh. Each member of the casting ensemble was powerfully brilliant, and one amazing ensemble I have ever seen on film. Also, the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is electrifying, and the couple sizzles on the screen, making it one of the most precious movie couples I have seen in a long time, and trust me, I have been through that before. Finally, the part I love the most, was the glorious music. The music was beautifully imagined, and either some music was made for the movie, or inspired by other famous artists, the soundtrack was still amazing, and it's an amazing wonder to hear. And the finale blends with a perfect notch of drama and heartbreak, and it's one of the most saddest endings since ""West Side Story"". ""Moulin Rouge"" is a perfect movie-musical containing heartbreaking drama, beautiful songs, and a perfect imagination from director Baz Luhrmann. It's all that's necessary to make one of the best musicals ever put to film. ""Moulin Rouge"", in my review, ""a powerful musical, with a beautiful soundtrack"".",Moulin Rouge!

But like i cant even begin to itemize the problems with this experimental failure.  Leguizamo you want to flog, nothing new there I guess. Broadbent at least fits his part, he has that turn of the century face, the rouged cheeks and wild eyes. Enough, I wont go on. Stay away from this.

If you've seen Baz Laurman's (I know I spelled that wrong, sorry) take on ""Romeo and Juliet"" you have a vague idea of what you're in for.  If you saw the video for the ""Lady Marmalade"" song, you have a very vague idea of what you're in for (by the way, the movie is a lot smarter than the video suggests).  Just make sure you watch it when you're good and alert cause there's more stuff going on in any given frame of film here than some movies have in their entire running length.This is a movie you're either going to passionately love or violently hate, but don't miss it.",Moulin Rouge!

He falls in love at first sight with a beautiful courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman) and they begin a dangerous love affair, as she also holds the keen affections of the Duke (Richard Roxburgh).I came out of this one with an overwhelming bittersweet feeling; it's ultimately a melancholy tale with very clear tragedy impending from the beginning. It was almost frustrating as I wanted to leave it with a more joyful emotion as the film is also filled with the most extraordinarily beautiful feel-good musical sequences, peppered with a delicious passion for the cinematic expression of reckless abandon and amazing vaudeville style. The costume design by Catherine Martin + Angus Strathie and set design by Brigitte Broch is breathtaking and I really think it's Baz Luhrmann's greatest film to date!The performances are all incredibly engaging with plenty of comic moments wonderfully performed to ensure every viewer has a whole emotional experience; awesome cinema 😀",Moulin Rouge!

154,jackasstrange,Perfect as a film can get,10,29 December 2013,"Baz Luhrmann masterpiece's 'Moulin Rouge' falls into the very definition of a masterpiece. Not only because it's like one of the greatest films ever made, but mainly because of its inimitable uniqueness for anyone, but the originator of the work, that obviously know the formula of his films. Few times i've seen in fact a film so great and peculiar to the point that it simply can't be reproduced. The style, the use of modern music in a period film, the crazy and stunning editing, and the colorful art direction and the excellent acting by both leads and also by the supporting actors are remarkable in this film. Again, never seen nothing like that before. The story may sound cliché, as the old Shakeaperian romance tale, but it simply don't matters in the end. What matters is the way its told here, in an entertaining and highly artistic way. Nicole Kidman is in one of his career-best performances in Moulin Rouge. Ewan McGregor also does well, but what really does even better than act is sing! His very first musical part is the best of the entire film in my opinion.The cinematography is fantastic, and there are tons of references to films of the early 20th century, all made for a comedic but conscious purpose. The scene when the lovers warmly embrace, there is a curtain in the shape of heart right behind them background can be seen the curtain in the shape of heart, doing a suggestive outline around them.Highly recommended and absolutely one of the best films i've seen. 9.7/10",Moulin Rouge!
155,gpeevers,A Truly Modern Musical,9,16 June 2009,"My favorite musical, it's also a tragic love story and is at times very funny.An idealistic young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) is wooed by the Bohemian lifestyle flourishing in Montmartre district of Paris where he falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman) a singer and courtesan at the famous nightclub Moulin Rouge. Along for the ride are Jim Broadbent (who would win an Oscar for Iris the same year) who plays Harold Zidler the club's manager, John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec and Richard Roxburgh as The Duke the couple's nemesis.Baz Luhrmann (Director, Writer, Producer) expressionistic vision is visually captivating and that combined with the film frenetic pace and wonderful use of contemporary music makes this a truly memorable experience.Strong performances from Kidman, McGregor, Broadbent and others but the exaggerated style and approach keeps these from being award winning roles though they are wonderful performances. In addition to their acting talents Kidman and McGregor are both worthy of praise for their singing talents, and Broadbent's single musical contribution is definitely memorable.Moulin Rouge was the third part of Luhrman's so called Red Curtain Trilogy, the first two parts being Strictly Ballroom and William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. The films share a creative team in addition to design and thematic elements though the stories and characters are not connected.The film was recognized throughout the world and nominated for 8 Oscars including Best Picture and would win two of them Costume Design and Set Decoration – Art Direction.",Moulin Rouge!
156,Dockelektro,Spectacle with some under achievements,7,21 October 2001,"I would really expect the most after ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"". I would really expect the rebirth of the musical movie. But one thing doesn't let me score this movie higher than 7. I would also expect a better vision of Montmartre and Paris altogether. This movie lacks universe, because the action and the characters are too restricted. What I mean is that this musical lacks that epic vein it could have, because everything turns around that group of 5 or 6 people, that group of 4 or 5 buildings (the rest of the audience and the people are man with top hats and girls with dresses, let's face it) and the result is a grand musical film, but which is presented with the scenery range of a play (just count the scenes that don't take place on studio). And this is the thing that left me craving the most, since I think Luhrmann's nuts were really too big when he grabbed music from the 80's and put them in 1900. There are too many musical highlights, but if I could choose one that really touched me more than the others, it's gotta be the powerful ""Tango de Roxanne"", which is as achieved as any masterpiece song we ever heard, and works also as a summit to all the movie. This is my conclusion: the movie is great, could have been even better. Love those opening credits, though. And oh yeah, how on Earth did they managed to turn John Leguizamo into a midget?

She performs on the stage, and for people with enough money, in bed too.But she falls in love with a penniless poet. Ummm...well that is the plot. Oh wait, I forget an evil duke.Baz Luhrmann, the crazy Aussie director, takes this simple plot and proceeds to hit the audience over the head with enough camera cuts, visual style and just plan Bazisms so that you are forced into feeling everything the characters feel in a way no other film maker does.Often I feel that Baz never has enough confidence to trust the audience to take the journey with him, but what what he does, only he does.From the first moment you are dragged into an amazing cinematic world where you should turn your brain off. This is not because the movie is stupid but because Baz and his film making team are going to do the thinking and feeling for you.Unique and amazing this movie uses things we are familiar with to transport us into a world that we don't really understand. A world where the can can is a notorious dance (actually women wore split crotch panties when they did this dance) and the electric light bulb was a modern wonder (people went to Moulin Rouge just to see this technological marvel...or so they told their wives).",Moulin Rouge!

Jim Broadbent, Ewan McGregor and John Leguizamo were very good.  I must admit another bias, I cannot stand Nicole Kidman.  I think her acting is egocentric hamming.  I think she was miscast and the movie suffered because of her.  Other problems were too quick MTVish shots and the penchant of the cast to yell their lines.

But after watching it I am really starting to wonder if I saw the same movie.The film is about Christian played by Ewan MacGreggor who goes to a Broadway theater Known as Moulin Rouge. The Star Singer Satine played by Nicole Kidman who is the star the keeps everybody coming back. The two find themselves in madly in love(Trust me I should know because they say it every 5 seconds) and work together to save the theater from being demolished.This is a very poorly shot film. Whoever edited this must have been hopped up on Starbucks and Tic-Tacs because every shot lasts about 2-5 seconds. The Characters are very odd and very strange for a film set in 1899. Speaking of why is it that in a film that is set in 1899 do we have Christina Agulera songs? But All of the stuff done with Ewan MacGreggor and Nicole Kidman are very well done and are two wonderful singer.

161,benoit-3,"Look, Ma! I'm wearing a feather boa!!",1,12 February 2002,"I got this movie on DVD for Christmas from my older brother Paul, who basically doesn't understand me and never will. He more or less told me: 'I saw this with my girlfriend and we both agreed it was kinetic, it was energetic, it was musical and superficial. We immediately thought of you' After seeing this atrocity, I have to seriously reconsider the image I project to my somewhat conservative family. ""Moulin Rouge!"" is the kind of film that makes you really consider with a jaundiced eye the sorry state of contemporary mass culture with desperate questions like 'Have we sunk so low?', 'Can we possibly survive?' and 'Don't we all deserve to die from shame for having had anything to do with the kind of society that can produce such a film and call it art?' I know it was produced by Australians and we should all cut them some slack for their relative lack of sophistication. I know Ms. Kidman gives a truly surprising performance as a dancer-singer (I thought she had no other talent than a certain ability to manipulate the media, which she shared with or possibly learned from her husband Tom Cruise) and I know it is probably supposed not to be taken at face value. But I can't forgive its pompousness, its grandiosity, its masquerading as something important while being such a patchwork of second-hand elements. It is supposed to infuse the viewer with the charm and cultural significance of turn-of-the-century Paris while paying homage to every French romantic creation from 'The Lady of the camelias' and 'Scènes de la vie de bohème' onward. Yet, the only spoken French words in the whole show are 'Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?' from the Patti Labelle 'Lady Marmalade' song, which has nothing whatsoever to do with Paris, Romanticism or French culture. The plot is a distillation of every melodrama ever written down to its bare bones: Poor poet loves girl; girl belongs to rich man; girl spits out her lungs. And this is supposed to be funny? It's anachronistic, turgid, necrophiliac and excessive. It's a movie for people who think synchronized swimming is a life-affirming art. It's what Ren said to Stimpy about cartoons: 'They're only puppets and they'll rot your brains!' It's supposed to make you want to get up and dance. It only made me wish I knew someone intellectually-challenged enough to accept this DVD as a worthwhile gift. The truth about this movie is that it's one big monumental camp that was conceived for people who have no grasp of history, of the world they live in, of their own identity, of their own cultural heritage and who like dressing up in mother's mesh stockings and inventing stories in front of the mirror when there's no one around. It's really meant to bring out the secret drag queen in every viewer. Trouble is I never nurtured my inner drag queen. And I can only see this movie for what it really is: a desperate attempt at meaning from feeble minds and, now that Oscar time is approaching, a desperate grasp for Academy members' attention and the supplementary mazzoola that Oscar's prestige can still confer on this undercooked, overripe tripe.""Moulin Rouge!"" - the exclamation point is meant to express revulsion - is to movie musicals what ""Family Guy"" is to TV sitcoms: a cheap gimmick for retards, a cheat and an easy way out.",Moulin Rouge!

He went into Moulin Rouge and met some very interesting and colourful characters and people.Satine (Nicole Kidman) is the most famous courtesan at Moulin Rouge and many are stunned by how she looked.

164,I_Am_The_Taylrus,"Very Strange, But This Film Is, Well, Spectacular!",9,26 November 2006,"SPOILERSIt's my 50th comment. I have decided to comment on Moulin Rouge! Now, I don't usually get into films like this, but when I saw this, I immediately loved it. Maybe because the film is so incredibly strange, or maybe because they actually have modern-day music in a film that takes place in 1899. I like classical music, don't get me wrong, but using modern-day music was a unique idea. Actually, the modern-day music sounds classical in this film. I actually had no idea that Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor could actually sing. This film taught me something.This film is about a man named Christian, a man who goes to Paris to write a story. But in Paris he is told to write a play called Spectacular Spectaular at the nightclub called the Moulin Rouge. There he meets Satine, a performer at Moulin Rouge. She also has a fatal disease. She thinks that she is the Duke. When she finds out that he is a poet with no money, she is baffled. Then he improves the play's plot, making it an Indian play. It use to take place in Switzerland. Christian and Satine fall in love. The real Duke likes the idea of the play. Then it turns out the real Duke wants Satine. He also wants to shut down the Moulin Rouge if he doesn't get her. When the Duke finds out that Christian is in love with Satine, he tries to kill him. Satine pretends that she doesn't love Christain and tells him to leave town. To protect Christian. When the Indian show debuts, Satine plays her part wearily, realizing that she is dying. Christian comes back and the Duke tries to kill him with a gun. He is foiled by the Moulin Rouge manager Harold Zidler. Then Satine collapses. She dies in Christian's arms as he weeps. Before she dies she tells him to write a story about them. A year later he does.Overall, this is very strange film. Yet it is very good. It also has very good camera angles and montages. I don't think there is any film quite like this. The acting of course it very good. This is a spectacular throughout.9/10",Moulin Rouge!

The music scenes are confusing and has too many songs overlapping.  Here's a tip, start a song, continue that song, and finish the song.  Then move on to the next song.

Even art (the so-called septième art') now seems to bow to post-modernist ego trips. From beginning to end, this film is an amazing lesson on how NOT to make movies. No kidding, Kidman, I really intend to incorporate it into my film classes: it exemplifies bad acting, bad directing, bad pseudo low key' photography, bad pseudoperiod sets, waste of money, feature-sized video clip aesthetics , and last but not least poor storytelling, or rather non-existing storytelling. It does defy not only cinematic conventions but also common sense, the Eisenstein theory of montage plus, incidentally, the spectator's tolerance, by delivering a most uninspired piece of boredom. It does take you on one of the wildest rides around a filmmaker  ego. What happened to talent? Kidman and  MacGregor have hardly been worse, and of course they can neither dance nor sing! Jim Broadbent is good, but even Bridget Jones' is an immensely superior movie. The use of Richard Rodgers, Jule Styne, Offenbach and other Baz' schmaltzy dated conceptions can only appeal to the self-indulgent spectator craving for arty crafts. The Tim Burton-like dark' cinematography is technically incompetent. It obliges to such an abominable aesthetics which video clips have been doing their best to impose upon mainstream cinema for about 20 years now. The visual effects are expensive, I'll say that. Kidman, by the way, seems to be a unique champion of some among the dearest of turkeys in movie history, as witnessed by Portrait of a lady' and Far and away.' Oddly enough, she was also in Eyes wide shut', To die for' and other genuine examples of exceptional filmmaking. At the heart of this sub-artistic would-be masterpiece is simply good old Dumas' Camille (Marguerite Gautier) dying of consumption within a tale of melodrama, bourgeois decadence and, of course, sex. Boy,  is it crude, thick pricks jokes and so forth! Kudos to Baz Luhrman! Not since the days of Lina Wertmuller and Anthony Newley and  I left the theatre with the feeling that someone  actually meant to mystify me by creating mystification! Warning: If you ever were in touch with studio-system artistic giants such as Ford, Hitchcock, Griffith and you name it which Hollywood sponsored during last century, you may be put off by Moulin Rouge's uniqueness! John Huston's Moulin Rouge was brilliant, though its leading hero, Toulouse-Lautrec was a grotesque figure. Jean Renoir's  French Cancan was lively, equally brilliant and musically rich. To the point. This Moulin Rouge, an homage to post-modern grotesquery, is simply grotesque , and its Toulouse' character, simple debauchery. Obnoxious.",Moulin Rouge!

The star are shining on the sky, and despite the terrible disaster that took place today, life goes on...does the show go on? That's a question for which the current answer is, and will probably continue to be for some time: yes, it does. I read somewhere that Moulin Rouge was the kind of movie which one either loved or hated. I can't agree with this fact, as I would fall in between. It's hard for me to say it was an excellent movie and I certainly can not say it was a terrible one. I guess it usually depends on what you want to see.  An everlasting subject: love. Everlasting, but rarely changing any more. Some stereotypes have been set and they are repeated. You can not expect of this movie to stun you with innovative ideas about love, as you can not expect Paul Anderson to do a good movie out of Resident Evil. Sorry there...got carried away.   Back to this film. I'd have to say a little confusing...totally lacking originality...sounding good, but not excellent. I know what happens when something sounds good, but not excellent: at first you enjoy it. Might happen the same thing the second and the third time. But then, the inevitable appears...it becomes boring. In the worst case, annoying. That's my opinion about the songs in this movie, and about the movie as a whole. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad...it can simply drive you mad!
  There's Nicole Kidman...yes, Nicole. I have just seen the movie, so I had little knowledge of her performance(in this movie) at the time of the Academy Awards. I was living under the impression that she would win, but it wasn't so. Sincerely speaking, I agree. I want to point out that I haven't seen the actual winning actress either, but I have my standards and Nicole wasn't good enough. She didn't make me feel the action...and she should've.  On the other hand, Ewan was acceptable...but he wasn't anything special either.    Actually, that's where the movie suffered. It didn't really get me connected, despite having a quite simple plot. I personally enjoyed the beginning most, until the story became routine. About love and how love will forever rule...   I guess I just couldn't feel this movie. Strange thing to say, but I couldn't. It is worth to see though, because I'm sure others will feel it, and because there are some interesting things in it. The few original ones. I vote for a 7.5/10",Moulin Rouge!

It is a feast for the eyes albeit a hyper-active one.  Each scene is memorable and lavishly spectacular.  The songs are easily recognizable and yet they are, in some cases, modified beyond belief.  The acting and singing is magnificent, Nicole and Ewan can belt out tunes with the best of them. But most of all this film is romantic... it will appeal to lovers of TITANIC and those that loved the innocent romanticism of the Golden Age of musicals. Nicole is at her very best in a daring and powerful role... she is becoming a GREAT actress!  Baz Luhrman follows up on his flamboyant reputation with a film that surpasses all his previous outings.  This is the best film of the past two years and I LOVE IT for being over the top and romantic and beautiful and silly and charming and truthful.  Oscar time is a long way off but this film WILL be remembered for sure.Congratulations Nicole, Ewan, and Baz on a film that will be a classic.",Moulin Rouge!

173,mistoppi,Beyond amazing!,9,9 April 2016,"Moulin Rouge! was on TV last night, and since I hadn't seen it in ages I decided to watch it. The story of Moulin Rouge! is quite simple when you think about it. But it's not just the story, there are of course other elements, like the bohemian revolution, and the characters' quest to have truth, beauty freedom and love in their play. And while the love story is simple, combined with everything else that's happening in the movie makes Moulin Rouge! quite unique, and clearly it stands out from the romance genre. While the story is of course tragic, Luhrmann and Pearce didn't make it just tragic. Moulin Rouge! is beautiful, lovely, tragic and hilarious. Moulin Rouge! is actually pretty wild, The shots and special effects alone make it so, but also the humour is amazing. There's a lot of misunderstandings and second-hand embarrassment, and so many other ways it's amazing. Especially the beginning of the movie is extremely wild, and it brings out the contrast between the tragedy of the movie.One of the strengths in Moulin Rouge! is the visual side of the film. It's extremely colourful and very detailed. Many of the set designs are extremely detailed - in fact they are so detailed, there's no point even trying to see every detail in certain rooms etcetera. Also a lot of scenes consist of extremely fast and short shots. That's usually fine by me, it creates a nice effect, but in some parts they are used way too much. Sometimes it hard to concentrate and focus because the shots don't necessarily flow so nicely. But still, that is just one thing, because otherwise the cinematography in this film is almost perfect.The music is beyond amazing! I have the soundtrack and I love each and every song on that soundtrack. They take songs from our time and put them in 1899, that's just amazing. My absolute favourite is El Tango De Roxanne, because they way the song Roxanne is turned into something completely knew is so effective, almost surprising every time I watch this movie. Also the choreography and the visual side of the scene during El Tango De Roxanne is just amazing. Apart from that I can not say which song is my favourite, because every song is so amazing. Sparkling Diamonds, Elephant Love Medley, Come What May, Someday I'll Fly Away... All those are magnificent!When you don't watch Moulin Rouge! for along time, you might forget about its charm. Maybe it's also because now I'm older, but Moulin Rouge! is probably one of my favourite musicals. Every part of this movie works.",Moulin Rouge!
174,fjhuerta-2,A modern cinematic masterpiece,10,27 August 2001,"Being a fan of silent cinema, it strikes me as odd that I liked so much this movie. Then again, there is a very good reason for this.During the silent cinema golden era, visionary directors such as Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau and others created bizarre interpretations of our world. They effectively expanded our perceptions by incorporating cinematic tricks, such as slanted angles, futuristic sets, chiaroscuro shots, and others.Moulin Rouge should be grouped among these movie wonders.This is cinematic art at its very best. The cinematography is fast, furious, and concise. Gripping. It locks your attention to the movie like no other I remember watching...(From now on, the review is *Chock full of spoilers*). ... for example, the opening shot, which is a movie theater within a movie theater, projecting an old movie of an old Moulin Rouge, with a music director conducting an orchestra playing the 20th Century Fox fanfare. Marvelous. The ending shot, with the gun flying overhead the Moulin Rouge and crashing with the Eiffel Tower. The entire depiction of the Moulin Rouge is amazing. The genius of the main character singing ""Your Song"" to the prostitute. ""Roxanne"" by The Police as a tango. Sheer geniality.Oh, and in case you are wondering, yes, there is a plot. And the ending is simply beautiful.You cannot miss it. It is a shoo-in for a perfect ten. It gets a 9, though, because I don't know how it will stand the test of time.",Moulin Rouge!

176,dumsumdumfai,Only exception .. so far,8,3 March 2011,"Mostly, I don't like musicals. The reasons being, it's not really a movie. However else fantastical the premise gets - I'm usually OK with that. Scifi, art-house, animation (dah!?), fantasy(up to a point), serial killer, comedy, and romantic comedies even.For me, musicals belongs to the stage. Cause people just don't break out in a song and dance. But this somehow works for me. Mostly because of the set, costume design and the swirling CGI.It works in that is it acceptable. The 8 is in relation to other movies - musical unbiased removed. Contrivices aside - the ridiculous love story, the insidious plot, the terminal illness...etc.Why? since all these are NORMAL within melodramas. So the argument is I'd rather watch these factors in a short 2.5hr musical with relatively young starts (Ewan and Nicole) ...with good choreography, lighting and cutting... than in 20 years of still camera shots in 'Days of our Lives'.",Moulin Rouge!

The scene on the rooftop where Satine and Christian sing back and forth to each other was wonderfully done.Spoiler...don't read ahead if you don't want the end spoiled!!!

178,Old Joe,"Fall in love, with the stylish musical, Moulin Rouge!",10,12 June 2001,"When I had the chance to see Moulin Rouge, I went into the cinema with no expectations, yet all I had heard was praise for this Australian film. To my delight, I was swept up in what I think will be one of the films of the year. In fact, this was the sort of film I have been hanging out for, for six months.A poet, against his father's wishes, moves to France, the 19th century equivalent of Andy Warhol's Factory. He falls into the world of Toulouse-Lautrec and his entourage, and is drafted to write a nightclub spectacular. In this seedy world of sex, drugs and electricity, he begins a passionate love affair with the club's highest paid star and courtesan.
Firstly, I want to give special praise for the script of Moulin Rouge. It was so spectacular spectacular', and there are so many reasons for this. Well the main reason would have to be the great soundtrack. The old classics, then a mixture of 20th century hits that had a great remix to suit the mood of the film. Then you have the dancing part of the script, which again helped set the music up to have a big impact on the audience. Then the last reason would have to be the very subtle change from the four main themes of Moulin Rouge: Truth, Beauty, Freedom and LOVE. The script also has a two sections to it. One half made me happy, the other made me sad and want to stand and applaud.  The cast of Moulin Rouge, while it might not be world wide known, it will put the Australian talent we have on show to the world. I want to praise the two main characters. Nicole Kidman, has had a rough trot this year, but this has not affected her acting talents. She was fantastic as  the beautiful Satine.  I never realised that Nicole could sing, but what a voice she has. This film will undoubtedly make her a big star in the following months, home and abroad. I look forward to seeing Kidman in future movie roles, because it will take a big role for her not to be known as the Moulin Rouge babe'. Then we have the role of Christian, played by  Ewan McGregor, the new Star Wars' man. While he was good in the Phantom Menace, McGregor showed off his real talents in this one. Again the dancing and singing of this Scottish born actor just amazed me. I felt that McGregor and Kidman had a great on-screen chemistry together. The wrong pairing for that part of Moulin Rouge would have spoilt the film completely.  The other people in the cast of Moulin Rouge, might not be too familiar to people overseas, yet being from Australia, I picked up on them immediately. Richard Boxborough, played the role of the duke and did it very well, plus there was John Leguizamo, Garry MacDonald, Christine Anu, David Wenham and a very special appearance by Australia's favourite girl  Kylie Minogue.
So, with a great cast and wonderful script, Moulin Rouge is a brilliant film for mine. It is very original, a little bit different to your ordinary film, and gives you another view of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The director of Moulin Rogue, Baz Luhrmann, deserves so much praise for this film, because this will put Aussie movies on the map. Finally, I want to leave you with a quote from Moulin Rogue that I will never forget, a reference to the movies main theme  LOVE:`The greatest thing is just to love, and  be loved in return'.Love is a very confusing and difficult emotion to handle, but this quote says it all. Give love and you should receive love. Oh how I wish I knew more of Shakespeare's work, because I am starting appreciate it even more. Count on one thing, I will be adding the DVD and soundtrack of Moulin Rouge to my collections when I have the chance to.  Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10 (Loud Applause!!!)",Moulin Rouge!
179,bbhlthph,I must be missing something here!,4,12 June 2006,"Back in 2001 when 'Moulin Rouge' was released, the reviews did not tempt me to see it and subsequently I forgot about it. I recently bought a copy of the DVD on impulse; assuming that it must be a re-make of John Huston's very fine 1952 film of the same name which was primarily a biography of the artist Toulouse-Lautrec. On playing it I found Baz Luhrmann's modernistic musical, which played like an extended music video rather than a coherent film. It had little appeal to me, and my first reaction was to rate it for IMDb at 1 star. One look at the ratings chart showed that this would be an extreme and unreasonable reaction to my disappointment (which was after all my own fault). Most ratings charts show a good approximation to a Gaussian distribution about whatever peak the film is judged to deserve, but here there is the perfect bi-polar distribution showing separate peaks at 1 star and 10 stars - clearly this is a film viewers either love or hate. Comments from database users who rated it at one star mostly felt, like I had, that it had nothing in common with what they expected from a good feature film and they therefore had nothing good to say about it; but those who rated it at ten were about seven times as numerous, and enthusiastically accepted what Luhrmann provided - however unexpected - as providing stimulating and rewarding viewing. With such an unconventional format, Luhrmann himself is probably more than happy to find seven viewers in tune with his presentation for every one who rejected it, and I had to acknowledge that my reaction perhaps resulted more from my limited tastes than from the film itself. User comments are presumably intended to concentrate on the qualities of the work concerned as assessed by the writer, and should as far as possible filter out idiosyncrasies of taste even when this is not easy to do. Generally when rating a film I like to consider three things - is it well constructed?, has it been created as the producer & director envisaged? and does it leave the viewer with something to think about when leaving the cinema? (The latter of course is not an essential as many films are only designed to give a weary viewer 90 minutes of complete relaxation - but I would never feel that such films should be rated higher than eight ) Re-attempting a fair evaluation on this basis, I still found myself unable to award Moulin Rouge more than a very generous four stars.The Moulin Rouge is now an almost legendary institution. Any film named after it has to show why it has had such an ongoing appeal for so many years. One wit said that visiting it is something every young man wants to do, unfortunately he often can't until he is too old to still enjoy it. It is this aspect of a sensuously seductive but often inaccessible haven for young men that should first be brought out in any film. The smoky atmosphere in which Toulouse-Lautrec spent night after night sketching a variety of entertainers who could just be seen through the haze was never brought out as it should have been (and was in John Huston's 1952 film). Instead we have clear sharp images swirling and blending in mostly brilliant lighting, as in a kaleidoscope. The incredibly rapid sequencing of visually incompatible images was extremely tiring to watch and for me contributed nothing to the story. The modern pop music continually jarred with the scenario of a building that is so closely associated with the elegance of the 1890's. The continual blending of not only different songs but totally different styles of music left me tired and breathless. The story of entertainers who are manipulated, in a way which often destroys their personal lives, by the impresarios and backers who are anxious to wring another few cents out of the production, is a very old and hackneyed one, but it could have still worked if the characters had been much more rounded and the audience had been able to feel more closely involved with them. This was quite impossible here.When writing a paragraph such as that above I normally feel I have reviewed the film in a way that should be helpful to at least some other movie-goers, but in this case I am left wondering whether I have only reviewed myself as a movie fan. Even in a situation where I cannot enjoy a particular film I can normally understand why other viewers with different tastes may do so. Here we have a situation where I can appreciate the elegance with which Moulin Rouge has been created, the story it tells, and the brilliance of individual sequences, but the way in which these sequences have been combined, and the totally inappropriateness of the sound track for the mood of the film, make it incomprehensible to me that the film could be given more than a low to mid-range rating by any viewer. Perhaps I have reached a point where I can no longer communicate effectively with a significant proportion of today's movie fans.My advice to readers is that those who can enjoy watching music videos continuously for an hour or more might love this film, anyone else should consider staying away. But, either way, do not watch this film to experience the magnetic attraction that the Moulin Rouge exerted in the Paris entertainment district for such a long period of time. Instead try to find a copy of the 1952 film of the same name.",Moulin Rouge!
180,ThomasColquith,Almost Unwatchable,2,1 October 2021,"""Moulin Rouge"" was a big letdown and far inferior to Baz Luhrmann's first film ""Strictly Ballroom."" ""Moulin Rouge"" had great potential but ultimately fails for a number of reasons. The direction, editing, and cinematography were poor, so poor in fact that the film is almost unwatchable, especially the first half. The frenetic pace, quick cutting, and carnival atmosphere was not cool, artistic, or groundbreaking, rather it ruins the film. If this script was approached in a more traditional serious manner, yet retaining the colorful set, costumes and dancing it would have been far superior. As it stands, it is hard to appreciate anything here, although I think that there was two good performances buried somewhere in that saccharine mess by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. It's a shame there wasn't a little more self-control exhibited here by the directors and producers. Also, the music was weak, not because the leads couldn't sing, but because of what they were given to work with, which was mostly pulled lyrics and partial songs. The musical numbers were all too abrupt, being mostly mishmashes of old pop songs that didn't allow for a full unimpeded performance, weakening the effect. My rating: another underachieving poorly done musical --- 2/10.",Moulin Rouge!
181,kyrat,brought me to tears - it's so bad!,1,2 June 2001,"I haven't paid to see such a bad film in many a year.Let me start with what I liked:  Ewan McGregor is very attractive & a good actor, and I generally like John Leguizamo (although I did not like the way they portrayed Toulese-Latrec as just some gay stereotype).  The only other plus - the costumes & mise-en-scene were very well-done (although I'm sure totally inaccurate).Otherwise it was so horrible, I almost wish I had paid to see ""the Animal"" instead.  I don't like musicals, but I can usually put up with the genre. Now I could be wrong, but wasn't Ewan McGregor lip-syncing?   What pained me the most was the anachronistic use of '80's songs/song lyrics (Nirvana, Madonna & the Police to name a few) -- was just too much for me.
It was the utter rejection of any realism that annoyed me.  The lovers float up among Disney-like stars & sprinkles (even their clothes change).  A gun comes out of window & flies across (a computer simulated) Paris to strike the Eiffel Tower.  I'm willing to grant a lot of poetic license (for example, a realistic victim of consumption hacking up lots of blood & completely emaciated would not have been good) - and certainly in a musical, we expect people to just randomly burst into song & dance -- but some semblance of normality would've been nice.The writing was mediocre at best.  Probably because the were dealing with a terribly trite plot.I'll spare you further and more specific complaints, because I can't bear to even contemplate this film anymore.  I simply had to add a warning as a counterpoint to the comment I saw posted here.",Moulin Rouge!
182,ArizWldcat,I paid money to see this??,1,24 February 2002,"My husband and I and some friends rented this movie the other night, as none of us had seen it and we heard it had been nominated for an Academy Award. We kept waiting for the ""good part""...and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. I wish I'd had a camera to capture the ""HUH???"" looks on all of our faces.
I read in another comment that people who didn't have a sense of humor wouldn't like this movie.  Let me tell you, we laughed.  A lot.  The inane use of cheesy song lyrics of the 70s made for loads of belly laughs because it was so HOKEY.  Other songs/lyrics incorporated into the dialog just made us shake our heads and roll our eyes.We came near to shutting off the movie several times as the gaudy, dizzying visuals made us sick.  We miraculously made it to the terrible ending of this movie (Spoiler alert) where we were shouting at Christian to go home and listen to his father...find a nice girl!!I guess this is the MTV version of the musical.  It made us want to go rent a real one, as this doesn't even deserve to be in the same genre as some of the truly great musicals of our time.If this piece of junk wins the Academy Award, I will not be surprised, but it will be a big disappointment, and further indication of how low we can sink if this crap is considered to be fine entertainment.I refuse to award this any stars.",Moulin Rouge!
183,kyle-cruse,"Incredibly different, and I loved it",9,20 June 2009,"It was hard to know what to expect with ""Moulin Rouge!"" and truthfully, nothing could have been expected. It's a totally unique film in just about every aspect. The film is a musical that maintain's the typical musical feel that goes along with such a love story as this, but what made it different was the fact that none of the musical was original. All of the songs are fairly contemporary, including such tunes as ""All You Need is Love,"" ""I Will Always Love You,"" and my favorite from this film, ""Come What May."" I would never have thought such a thing would work, but believe me it does. I couldn't help smiling throughout just about every musical number in the film, and the spontaneous singing or songs we all know but could never have predicted in such a film as thing made it even more delightful. Plot-wise, the story is similar to such things as ""Shakespeare in Love"" (in which the play being written in the film is being inspired by the main characters' secret romance) and ""West Side Story"" (in which the main characters cannot be together due to forbidden love and such). However, it was the way this film was made that made it feel so original, with the quick and unexpected scenes such as characters suddenly falling in through the roof and the quick pace at which the film goes by. The music made the film for me, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman had perfect chemistry. I admit that it might be bizarre at times, which may turn some people off, and it is still a tragic story, but I loved it anyway. Wow, it's hard to know what else to say about this film, expect that it became an instant favorite and is a must-see for movie lovers. It was robbed of Best Picture. We don't see many films this unique, or this good, anymore.***1/2 out of ****",Moulin Rouge!
184,Aussie Stud,Am I the only person who simply *HATED* this movie?,1,16 January 2002,"I have read so many posts on this message board concerning the adoration and delight people have expressed for ""MOULIN ROUGE"", for both its usage of creativity and for its stars, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I skipped seeing this film when it was playing at the movies but my curiosity was spiked by the time it hit the video rental shelves at my local video store.""MOULIN ROUGE"" has indeed garnered much favoritism from critic's circles, award panels and esteemed film reviewers alike. Unfortunately, the only award I would hand this film would be a Golden Raspberry.The opening sequence of ""MOULIN ROUGE"" was interesting enough. I enjoyed the camera sequence going through the city of old Paris as we are introduced to Ewan McGregor's character... and then the film pretty much falls flat on its face from thereon in.I am not Nicole Kidman's biggest fan. I did enjoy her in ""THE OTHERS"", but I have to say that her performance in this film would be about on par as that in ""BMX BANDITS"" or ""BUSH CHRISTMAS"". I thought the musical pieces in ""MOULIN ROUGE"" were 'ear-bleedingly' awful, especially the sequence where both Ewan and Nicole are serenading each other with snippets of songs such as ""I Was Made For Loving You"" and ""Silly Love Songs"". There is one truly awful moment in the film that involves a man screeching out an unforgivable horrendous rendition of The Police's ""Roxanne"".It was about the scene where John Leguizamo and his side-kicks gate-crash Ewan McGregor's personal home-warming to have him join their performing art troupe where Ewan finds himself bellowing out a sonnet of ""The Hills Are Alive"" from ""THE SOUND OF MUSIC"" that I found myself losing patience for this movie. My nerves and patience at that point were already at razor's edge. A special appearance by Kylie Minogue as 'The Green Fairy' in a 'Tinkerbell'-type role was the final straw for me.I shifted myself to the next room to work on the computer and for the next two hours, all I heard was non-stop 'yahooing' and music that resembled the sound a tin bucket would make after it was kicked down an endless flight of stairs. Towards the end, I was wondering aloud, ""Please! Make the hurting stop!"" The two other people I live with had already secretly exited the living room behind my back to escape the noise.I know that Nicole Kidman's main professional talent is targeted mainly towards acting. It is not a fair suggestion on my behalf to opine that she should work harder on the acting and leave the 'singing' thing alone altogether.I was very disappointed with this movie. For all the fabulous write-up it has been receiving from famous reviewers and everyday people like you and I, I was expecting a great deal more from ""MOULIN ROUGE"". I really REALLY wanted to like ""MOULIN ROUGE"", but I just couldn't get into it. Please don't accuse me of having a narrow mind because I am a very open-minded person when it comes to film projects. I am sure that Baz Luhrmann had a well-planned artistic dream when he put this film together. Unfortunately for me, it turned out to be one long nightmare. One reviewer on this web-site mentioned that they are ""in love"" with Moulin Rouge. I guess my motto would be, ""I hate Moulin Rouge"".My Rating: 1 out of 10",Moulin Rouge!
185,Rathko,Definite 'Love-It-Or-Loathe-It' Territory,8,22 September 2001,"There are those moments in the film so excruciatingly embarrassing that you quite literally squirm in your seat in discomfort.  Similarly, there are sequences that make the hairs stand up on your arms, your skin turn to gooseflesh, and transport you so far from the cinema that you can forget about all the gibbering, squawking 13 year olds behind you.  Jam-packed with a dozen kinds of digital jiggery-pokery and some of the most incredible and overblown set design this side of Bollywood, the movie is like a 2hr MTV clip designed by Pierre et Gilles (and that's no bad thing).  Okay, so there's very little story, nothing in the way of character arcs or subplot and midpoint climaxes, but there IS lots of colour, dancing and jaw dropping spectacle.  Kidman and McGregor give excellent performances given the context, she a modern day Gilda (but where's the piano?), he all grinning naivety (with an excellent voice).  The music is brilliantly mixed, at times several songs blending together into an indefinable, yet oddly familiar whole.  Highlights, for me -- the duel/exchange of love song lyrics mutating into Bowie's 'Heroes' atop a gilded elephant, and the excellent tango/Roxanne sequence.  Definitely a love it or loathe it film. Indifference unlikely.",Moulin Rouge!
186,MF210,A Beautiful and Imaginative film,9,7 December 2003,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Musicals have been undergoing a comeback since the release of two new musicals: Moulin Rouge and Chicago. Both these films were impressive musicals that I love. Musicals have never been my favorite genre but when they are well done, the time passes by very quickly. Both of those films qualify. Moulin Rouge could have something to do with Chicago's success. Yes, Moulin Rouge only gained around 50-60 million and Chicago gained over 100 million. But Moulin Rouge was nominated for a fair share of Oscars. It started the comeback and Chicago only made it more successful. Both films are quite different. Moulin Rouge is much more of a visual feast than Chicago, and what a feast this is. The sets are beautiful and imaginative. The costumes are flashy and stunning. In fact, this film is such a visual feast, that many could call it overkill. Did they over do it? Yes and at times some things seem a bit excessive. But Baz Luhrmann is known for this and he does not care. With the exception of one, the musical numbers all have magic to them. I did not much care for the ""so exciting"" number. Other than that the numbers are all great. The acting is mostly good. Nicole Kidman stunned me with this performance. Her voice was perfect and she did not stumble at all. She definitely deserved the oscar nomination. Ewan McGregor is the perfect match for her. They have great chemistry together and McGregor does a good job singing. Jim Broadbent also does an excellent job and was robbed of a nomination. Really, the only casting complaint I have is John Leguiziamo. He was terrible and irritating. Moulin Rouge is a very good film and definitelyy worth a look. It is a beautiful and magical experience. Unless you are put off by really fancy sets, which I do not think many are then watch this film.",Moulin Rouge!
187,patryk-czekaj,Spectacular (but also very sad) show !,7,13 May 2012,"Even though I'm not a big fan of musicals, I must definitely say that Moulin Rouge! is a very unconventional movie, when it comes to this specific genre, and with that it immediately caught my attention. Even though it tells a truly saddening story, it's mostly presented in a very joyful manner, with spectacular performances and great dance-and-sing acts.Christopher, a young English writer, arrives in Paris in order to follow the Bohemian Revolution that started in the city's underground world. However, after he is introduced to the prostitute and drug infested community things start to spiral out of control. He meets a beautiful courtesan Satine and deep affection soon follows. The romance takes a hold of this young couple, but nothing can be complete without a few problems on the road. Mainly, the Duke, the sponsor of the whole play, has a thing for Satine too. And in order for the great performance to come to fruition she has to stop running around with Christopher and give in to Duke's filthy desiresIt's amazing that through this simple story Baz Luhrmann is able to depict the harsh truth about our lives. Even if we love someone dearly and with all our hearts, there can always be someone to stand in our way. Someone richer and more powerful and who is actually able to buy his dreams instead of working to achieve them. And even being able to withhold this obstacle may be not enough, as the movie sadly shows.Funny thing is that the first 15 or 20 minutes make an impression that the movie is going to be weirdly psychedelic. The use of light, colors, fast camera movements and, most of all, eerie characters, provide for an unforgettable experience. Still, a few moments later there is a sudden change of pace and the movie takes on a new turn to make it more dramatic. And this is a recurring motive in this picture.The music in Moulin Rouge is very enjoyable and fun to listen, due to many very clever mash- ups of famous songs by world-renown artists, including Madonna, Queen, Elton John, Marilyn Monroe and even Nirvana. The versions written for Moulin Rouge! give those songs a brand new twist, and are actually very entertaining.The movie also makes a great use of various camera techniques, especially of regular close close-ups and numerous swirls and spins, to give the picture an avant-garde feeling.Great acting by young Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman is the true quality, which shapes the overall appearance of this film. There are some fantastic (and erotic) sequences that may deliver many laughs. However, the scene, which represents the brilliance of these two actors, is contained in the big finale - the great and fabulous theatrical show, which ends in a huge tragedy. There aren't many pictures, where you'll find such a passionate scene of unbearable and tragic loss, accompanied by such loud cries of helplessness. A true tearjerker.Overall, I would like to say that it is definitely a movie worth watching, and as a proof of it look at the trend that may be observed throughout the first decade of the 21st century: after Moulin Rouge!'s success many musical features started appearing all around the world. And they still are. That's the power of this film.",Moulin Rouge!
188,TuckMN,`I'm paid to make men believe what they want to believe.',8,18 February 2002,"This is a `Cabaret' for the twenty-first century but without the original songs. Instead it builds  on the work of other genius -- which leaves it somewhat hollow at the core.  There is a great deal of genius -- here but it is borrowed genius: It is in the art direction, musical direction, lightening fast editing and the overall vision of director Baz Luhrmann. This film borrows from every known source: paintings, cartoons, with `Camille,' Satyricon,' and `Streetcar Named Desire' to name just a few of the film sources. Musically it is stunning.  But even more stunning is how other people's music is used to tell this story -- a story originally told by Alexandre Dumas. The choreography is amazing; particularly the routine set to Sting's Roxanne.' It is jaw dropping.John Lequizamo, as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, (especially when dressed as the sitar that could only tell the truth') is a brilliant piece of character acting.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor do their own singing and they do it admirably.Everything is simplified: The Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) is evil.

190,axlrhodes,Bombastic fun.,8,14 August 2012,"Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Moulin Rouge, and cinema's fourth visit, is a boisterous musical journey into the famed seedy underworld of early 2oth century Paris. Visually arresting and with more energy than Tom Cruise on speed, Luhrmann's film strikes a rare balance of appearing to be on the brink of losing control while remaining sharply focused and fully on key. For a cast with no track record in musicals, there's an inherent 'holding of breath' before each characters melodic introduction and although it's clear that neither Kidman of McGregor are ever going to win awards for vocal prowess, their commitment and respective charms are more than enough to keep the central love story alive while allowing us to marvel at the stunning musical arrangements that cover a colourful medley of everything from Rogers and Hammerstein to Nirvana. Beyond all the razzamatazz and histrionics there lies a central love story. That such a thing as true love could exist in a world fuelled by exploitation and sex is an excellent jumping off point for the story of Christian (Ewan Mcgregor) who as a writer, has come to Paris to capture a flavour of the infectious bohemian spirit perpetuated at the lively Moulin Rouge. It's there that Christian encounters Satine (Nicole Kidman) who as the nightclub's most coveted attraction embodies all the traits of the tortured starlet. Satine is beautiful and talented, but her ambition to attain fame beyond the confines of 'the rouge' means selling herself to the extent of sacrificing personal happiness in favour of stardom. Christians naivety and innocence is attractive to Satine and his ability to break through the illusion and lies of her world begin to entice her away from the things she has always strived for. Circling like a predator is 'The Duke' (Richard Roxburgh) who forms the third part of a dangerous love triangle. The Duke is a powerful man with the means to provide Satine with her big break, but only for the price of her affections which gives way to an emotional tug-of-war played out through a series of perfectly bombastic song and dance numbers. At times it becomes a game of name that tune as one infectious melody merges into another. One number that threatens to steal the show is Jim Broadbent's 'Like A Virgin', which is so over the top in delivery that it's hard to deny a constant smile. Indeed, for much of the runtime, the film aims to captivate and arouse that sense of cheeky, nod-nod-wink-wink humour in way that's never overly salacious and falls on the right side of good taste. In summary, a good old fashioned story of love set against a decadent backdrop and told with an agreeably trippy verve with likable performances.",Moulin Rouge!

It was just too many bizarre scenes that didn't mean anything to me. However, there was one particular moment in the movie (and anyone seeing it will know when it was) that it all turned around. I would rate the last 2/3 as over a 9. I really, really liked it. And, I rarely say this, but I would like to see it again - especially the last hour+.The acting was very good, but the direction was sensational - hard to imagine how it could be beat.

192,CMTiago,You'll either love it or hate it,10,18 October 2014,"Moulin Rouge! has cemented itself as one of my most cherished movies of all time. It was the first film that made me cry, and that's saying something since very few movies have done this.We are introduced to Paris at the start of the 20th Century. The bohemian spirit is alive and well, so a young English man traveling from London named Christian, decides to get involved in this movement. Upon meeting a group of misfits, lead by Toulouse-Latrec, Christian is set up as the writer of a new play that will embody the values of the bohemians: Truth, Beauty, Freedom and above all Love. He ends up falling for Satine, a beautiful courtesan that sells her love. Trouble arises when the play's investor, The Duke, is also enchanted by Satine. What follows is a tale of despair and heartbreak that will showcase a full range of emotions.What gets to me most in this movie, are the musical numbers which are mostly well sung and choreographed. From the wonderful Your Song to the magical Elephant Love Medley, and from the beautiful Come What May to the daring El Tango De Roxanne, everything falls into place in a wonderful production work. It also helps that the movie is extremely well acted and the cast's strenght help the message get across.Moulin Rouge! is by no means a perfect movie. No movie is, at least in not in the sense that everyone is fully pleased, and despite my feelings towards it, I too recognize the flaws. Still no movie pulls me into the fantastic world that is cinema quite like Moulin Rouge! . That for me is worth every penny.Rating: 10/10",Moulin Rouge!
193,saarvardi,A celebration of color and catchy musical numbers which explode unto the screen,9,13 April 2007,"Shortly before there were Chicago and Dreamgirls (and all the others of their likes), there was Moulin Rouge. The film that revived the musical genre and made it relevant once again is a celebration of color and catchy musical numbers which explode unto the screen in a whirlpool of emotions.The plot brings us the story of a turn of the 20th century English poet living in France (Ewan McGregor in one of his best performance), who binds forces with a group of local bohemians, who urge him to write a musical play for the Moulin Rouge, a famous nightclub in Paris. A series of identity mistakes leads him to the Rouge's lead star (Nicole Kidman), who hasn't the faintest idea he is but a poor poet. The music comes in gear frequently across the movie, combining mid to late 20th century pop numbers with the dazzling re-staging of the 1899 France. Kidman and McGregor sing to each other about heart ache, about class differences and about love in a free and better world. When McGregor sings Elton John's ""Your Song"" with the stars and moon twinkling behind him, real magic sends vibrations and electricity through the screen and into the viewer's heart. In fact, it seems as though Australian director Baz Luhrmann did such a great job this time around, he didn't shoot another film since (check his IMDb credentials for confirmation). Now if that's not putting your whole heart and soul to a love product, I don't know what is.",Moulin Rouge!
194,extravaluejotter,"""La Boheme"" gets the Guy Ritchie Treatment",1,4 February 2006,"Yes, I know that it was actually directed by Baz Luhrmann, but ""Moulin Rouge"" has all the car-crash visual energy of ""Snatch"".Unfortunately, the movie is as desperately shallow as ""Snatch"" as well. Who decided that dressing the (let's face it) grim and terminally depressing story of ""La Boheme"" up in glitter and skimpy costumes, then filming it as a 2-hour long pop video was a good idea? I suspect that the cast and director were having so much fun making this train-wreck of a musical, that no-one wondered how long its appeal would last for.In a century's time, people will still dress up, then sit grimly in opera houses and endure ""La Boheme"" sung in a foreign language because it's a ""classic"". I wonder if anyone will still watch (or even understand) ""Moulin Rouge"" that far into the future?",Moulin Rouge!
195,Pavel-8,Unlike anything you've ever seen.,8,14 March 2003,"The opening moments of this movie were a bit disorienting, as I was swept into a world and a film unlike any other I'd ever experienced.  But I kept in mind that Baz Luhrman simply doesn't make normal movies (See other work 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo & Juliet'), but rather audio-visual extravaganzas.  The music is what carries the film as the quirky pop adaptations, although odd at first, work very well and mesh seamlessly with the equally high-caliber original music.  In fact this is the rare film that, while nothing quite compares to a theatrical viewing, is as good on DVD.  I attribute this to the music.  Like listening to a favorite CD over and over, 'Moulin Rouge!' is an enjoyable two hours time and time again, and the music will stay with you for even longer.  But unlike many movie musicals, the music here advances the story along, rather than simply providing melodious entertainment.  It also enhances the story by displaying a greater depth of emotion than most mere words are capable of expressing.  As for the vocal qualities, I found it quite refreshing to listen to the actual singing voices of the cast.  Kidman, McGregor, and others supplied their own vocals, which was a fantastic change from the typical pre-packaged pop or opera sounds.  Tough movie to describe, but in a sentence, it's a flashy, fast-cutting, moving-camera, music-drenched portrayal of a love story set within a modern turn of last century nightclub.  Bottom Line:  Every year there are two or three movies that genuinely get me excited about what can be done with and through film.  'Moulin Rouge' was one of those in 2001.  Top Five of the year. 8.5/10",Moulin Rouge!

197,peacham,Exciting and Innovative!,10,26 December 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a spectacular piece of entertainment. Its fun,visually stunning and totally engrossing. I was a bit leary considering the fact that director Bar Luhurmann was responsible from the assinine ""Romeo and Juliet"" adaptation several years ago.But my fears were put to rest with this charming film. The true star is Catherine Martin's awe inspiring design work. No film has ever looked so visually beautiful.The performances,of course, are nothing to sneeze at...the fetching Nicole Kidman is sheer delight as Satine and posseses a singing voice that was quiete appealing.She turns in a sexy and stunning performance. Ewan McGregor is equally fine as the poet, Christian. Jim Broadbent steals every scene he is in as the Moulin Rouge's boisterous owner and M.C.,Harold Zidler.Broadbent is one of today's finest actor's and here he pulls out all the stops. I will say that I am not a fan of some of the music used in the film,(Roxanne,and Zidler's first song)however as reinterpreted by these fine actors, they are quite enjoyable. Luhrmann deserves applause for this fine achievement in cinema.",Moulin Rouge!
198,pswanson00,Be forewarned,1,2 January 2005,"First, a confession: I didn't watch the whole movie. The first 15 minutes of this film are so frenzied, and do so little to propel anything resembling a story, that I couldn't stand the thought of sitting through the whole thing. I am a fan of both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, and I found their talents to be completely wasted in this brightly-colored mess. Maybe I'm too old to get it; this appears to have been edited for the MTV generation, or any viewer with a severely limited attention span. I need to add lines in order to have my review accepted, so I will say that the set design was spectacular, although with too many computer-generated backgrounds for me. Maybe if this comes on Showtime sometime when I'm suffering insomnia, I'll give it another try...but I doubt it.",Moulin Rouge!
199,m_madhu,Exhilerating!!!!!,9,12 February 2002,"Moulin Rouge! with the exclamation mark. phew!! what an experince. i finally saw the movie, expecting to hate it. i was expecting a hollywood version of a bollywood song, dance masala pot-boiler. was i ever wrong.the movie is clever. it is funny. it is amusing and it is full of little clever touches that is an absolute delight for any trivia lover. baz luhrmann has delivered a very clever version of a highly cliched, trite and stupid base plot.there is so much to admire about the movie. sure, the colour and style are a revelation for a hollywood movie. but for someone exposed to a lot of bollywood it is nothing great. i also particularly like the indian touches. quit funny really :)i say, how can anyone not like a movie that has a broadway version of smells like teen spirit?? how can you not love the big trip on lautrec??!!?? madonna, the beatles, freddy mercury. nobody is spared. everyone is included in this joyride. oh!! and the hills are alive with the sound of music??? :)) kylie minogue as the green fairy??? what a madcap rollercoaster movie!!! i loved it.if it werent for the fact extremely stupid and boring main plot. this would have earned a perfect 10. points docked for that. go ahead and watch this stylish fun caper anyway!!a rollercoaster 9!!",Moulin Rouge!
200,Dodger-9,Breathtaking,10,12 September 2001,"A few days before seeing the movie, I watched Baz Luhrmann selling the film in Cannes and all over the States thanks to a BBC documentary. I was sold on the film just from seeing an army of suited guys giving an operatic rendition of Smells Like Teen Spirit - and that's not even one per cent of this film's brilliance.In perhaps the bleakest year for big screen offerings, MR is one of the most welcome movies of 2001. A treat to look at, fast, funny, daring, sexy, rousing, exciting - everything a good movie should be. But if the set design and music weren't there, then it would still have worked purely because of the chemistry between Nicole and Ewan. They look like they're having fun which is worth the price of admission alone.An instant masterpiece.",Moulin Rouge!
201,Kirasjeri,"AN WILD EXPERIENCE! ORIGINAL and EYE-CATCHING, but not for everyone.",7,4 June 2001,"Anyone expecting anything even remotely like the 1952 ""Moulin Rouge"" with Jose Ferrer (see reviews) will be blown away by this. I was. This was closer to something like the Ferrer version meets ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", less the sexual identity confusion so popular with some.First of all, the cinematography and general camera work were daring and effective. Kudos to the director. The art direction was utterly fabulous and almost certain to get an Oscar nomination; the sets, costumes, and general 'look' of the film were original, beautiful, and brilliant.
The music was jolting in that much of it was from popular and rock music of the past generation - that in Paris in 1900! Offenbach's ""Can-Can"" was set to words and sung, but not on the floor of the Moulin Rouge club; for that we had ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" done by Nicole Kidman as Satine the club's sensuous star. After the initial surprise at the anachronistic music we learn to adjust to it and ""go with the flow"". The same with the wild, often frenetic direction with over-the-top lighting. The story and characterizations are none too deep: young writer falls in love with the gorgeous star but she is coveted by the rich duke who owns the lease on the club. True love triumphs over obstacles, but eventually tragedy results. (Anyone see ""La Traviata""?). But the plot isn't the point. You want deep character studies rent the 1952 version with Jose Ferrer as Henri Toulose-Lautrec, here played by John Leguizamo, but without even an allusion to his painting prowess.The plot might have ben more interesting had Satine and Henri (called ""Toulose"" in the film, just as in the 1952 version!) the undersized artist had some relationship. The rest of the acting was quite good with Jim Broadbent (see ""Topsy Turvy"") particularly unctious as the club's manager.Definitely RECOMMENDED. Although I know well it is NOT for everyone and there are those who may hate it for the frenzied pace, the music, and an almost surreal feel at time - a singing moon, for instance! But I liked it; I thought it cool!One warning/complaint. I saw this in a Cineplex Odeon theater in NYC. And the second and last reels (total of thirty minutes) were noticeable BLURRY. Bad job, Cineplex Odeon. If anyone else has a complaint just go to their web site and forward it along.",Moulin Rouge!

While I did feel that some parts of the film felt too chaotic for my taste, I do understand that this was done for dramatic effect and it did add to the overall quality of the film.As a film, I would probably rate it an 8/10. However, the score ultimately sealed the deal for me which leads to my final rating, 9/10.",Moulin Rouge!
204,jaddison383,The Witnessing of Masterpiece...,8,9 October 2008,"Moulin Rouge! never concerns itself with reality, possibility, or the common things of life. No, this is a film that shatters all preconceived notions of what a movie looks like and embraces the bizarre and the beautiful with arms wide open. Director Baz Luhrmann has created something utterly unique, a movie the likes of which I doubt I will ever see again.The Moulin Rouge! is a risqué cabaret in the Underworld of Paris in the early twentieth century. When a young and naive poet comes to the show in hopes of writing it's very first real production, he falls in love with the cabaret's star, Satine. On the very same night, a rich duke who is considering financing the club to turn into a respectable theater is basing his decision on the charms and devotion of Satine. All is played out to dramatic and exuberant musical numbers.Luhrmann directs his cast to perfection, with Nicole Kidman delivering one of her best (and Oscar-nominated) performances. Ewan McGregor, Richard Roxburgh, John Leguizamo, and particularly Jim Broadbent all deliver wonderfully charismatic performances as well. And the music!!! Using groundbreaking compilations of modern pop songs reworked as musical numbers, the soundtrack is simply enthralling from the very first moment. In the areas of costumes, makeup, and art direction, the film is monumental.There is a strange feeling of both energy and exhaustion that overtakes you as Moulin Rouge! comes to a close. It's a feeling that is rare not only with films, but with life in general. It is the feeling you get when you realize you have seen a masterpiece, and it is the feeling you will no doubt have when you witness Moulin Rouge! 9/10 stars!!! Jay Addison",Moulin Rouge!
205,DanB-4,Original and Over the Top,10,29 December 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a daring, over the top film that does not spare any amount of excess, take itself at all seriously or stick to any movie conventions. It could have ended up a wretched exercise in self indulgence and overkill, but instead emerges a modern classic. There are many vastly varying comments on this film. Some disparage the plot line for its simplicity and lack of originality. To these people I say rent the DVD, read about the film and watch it closely. It was absolutely intended to be a simple love story told through the medium of song. (This completes Baz Luhrmann's previous efforts, telling a love story through dance in Strictly Ballroom and spoken word in Romeo and Juliette). Some also did not like the reused music. This is something you will either love or hate. I loved it, particularly because they chose my wedding song (Elton John's Your Song) as the key song of the love story, ever-so-slightly re-written. If the Elephant Love Medley does not put a smile on your face, then you are in desperate need of a long holiday.The movie is brilliantly cast with Nicole Kidman as Santine, the courtesan who breaks her greatest vow, never to fall in love, Ewan McGregor as Christain, the ""penniless writer"" who believes that love is life's greatest gift and Richard Roxbough, who makes the film with his role as the insanely jealous Duke trying to buy Santine's affections.Will love win over money? Will Santine and Christain finally admit their feelings? Will the Duke be shunned? Will the show go on? Is the Pope catholic? These questions are not important to the movie's success. The screen is crammed with images and action, every dance number leaves nothing on the table and it is all played bursting with life. I loved this movie.Nicole Kidman is at the peak of her career here, carrying this ambitious film on her shoulders. As beautiful as any woman on Earth, she is a delight to watch as her character effortlessly transforms from performer to lover to seductress to businesswoman to ailing patient. She covers every range, sings, dances and looks perfect. An Oscar is not unreasonable, and no nomination would be a crime.See this film. Leave your plot-following, analytical senses at the door and go along for the ride. This is one of the best films of the past 10 years. **** out of ****.",Moulin Rouge!
206,Snowgo,An Acid Trip While Having the Flu,1,21 August 2014,"This movie is one of only two that I hate most. I love musicals. That is why I hate Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge is emblematic of everything in modern culture that is flashy, maybe even entrancing on the outside, and empty and meaningless. I think what I hate most about this movie is its pretentiousness. Changing form masquerades as substance. This movie is a caricature of modern life and the worldview of those who are brain-dead materialists. If you want to get my attention and keep it, you better have 1.) heart and 2.) brains. Moulin Rouge has neither. I would not call Moulin rouge a musical. I would consider it an attempt at extreme exaggeration by someone knowledgeable in conformity, illusion and hypnosis. In that sense, it may be an important movie, psychologically and sociologically.",Moulin Rouge!
207,GMJames,Style over substance = a creative mess,6,6 January 2002,"I was about to give up on Moulin Rouge just over the halfway mark when the ""El Tango de Roxanne Medley"" appeared. I will never listen to Sting's ""Roxanne"" the same way again. (A big thanks to actor Jacek Koman as the ""Unconscious Argentinian"" for performing the song.) It was one of the few times I tried to give a movie one more chance to prove itself. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang pleasantly and were certainly up for the challenge director Baz Luhrmann was giving them. Overall, Moulin Rouge is a stylish, ambitious and gleefully over-the-top musical romance that is very heavy on the senses and is, fatally, very light on plot. As mentioned before, portions of the movie are better than the entire film.",Moulin Rouge!
208,jburtroald95,Truly fantastic!!,10,5 September 2009,"This sensational one-of-a-kind spectacle took me completely by surprise and took me to an entirely different world, the dazzling surreal and quite overwhelming universe of the famous french nightclub of the title.There is something truly refreshing about Baz's work. It is so rich, elaborate and filled with such wonder and feeling. Each creation of his is just irresistible and is unlike any conventional film, therefore impossible to categorise it according to genre without disrespecting it.Critics usually express dislike of his films in their reviews as these pictures are not ones meant to be picked apart and analysed, but better watched openly and with an attitude that allows you to be entertained. They aren't ones that are really designed to be reviewed, and watching the clueless and pitiful critics' reaction is quite funny.Moulin Rouge! is certainly no exception, but unfortunately like the marvellous 'Australia"" it is quite often unappreciated. Please avoid making such common mistakes and take the wonderful opportunity as I have, and I have never been felt happier!",Moulin Rouge!

Instead, I was punished with the story of two lovebirds who are too stupid to communicate with each other. They stold two hours of my life with a story that is more holey than a Swiss cheese, stinks more than an old mold cheese left for 3 weeks on the heater and pictures that were filmed so strange that it feels like someone would spank me with Picasso's. The costumes and sets are really beautiful, but you have no way to enjoy them, because the pseudo art-house style that penetrates the movie from all sides makes it absolutely horrible.I like all the actors and that makes it even worse because it feels like your best friend spit in your face again and again.

All the music nd singing hurts my ears and brain. It's not a bad movie but definitely not deserving of the hype and academy awards. Without Nicole Kidman's beauty and Her exuding Her great emotions, I wouldn't care about this movie. She is so BEAUTIFUL and Exudes such sensuality and affection that it's easy to fall in love with Her. I want Her! I want to go back to 2001, and be in this movie and make love with her in the movie! But I can't watch this movie more than once because of all the music and singing and crying. If Roxanne is a Prostitute, She's the type that You fall in love with and want all to yourself! I guess I think like the movie's villain. But can you blame Him for wanting Her all to himself?! Nope! I WANT YOU, NICOLE KIDMAN! But I can't watch this movie more than the one time I did a few years ago. It's too tedious. Maybe it's a good film, i just don't understand all the hype. It's sad Roxanne dies.

This film does not measure up at all against its 1952 version starring Jose Ferrer as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Trying to mix the 19th Century with the 21st Century is like mixing oil and water. The 19th Century music in the original film was far more interesting than the music in the 2001 film. The plot seemed contrived just as opera plots are contrived to make the music fit in. It was an attempt to immitate the 1930's-1950's musicals which often did not make sense and were boring in their own way. This as boring, not in the same class as South Pacific, Carousel, and Show Boat. One reason is that Nicole Kidman, really miscast in her role, is not the caliber of singer that starred in the great musicals. Her singing was better than most actresses but the great musicals used great singers.",Moulin Rouge!
212,marxsarx,Spectacular! Spectacular!,10,27 March 2003,"Absolutely breathtaking.  ""Moulin Rouge"" is director Baz Luhrman's pop music masterpiece about Christian, a struggling writer who goes to Paris, France in 1899 and falls head over heels in love with Satine, a courtesan in the French nightclub known as the Moulin Rouge.  ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return!"" Filmed entirely on soundstages in Australia, this haunting love story with a bittersweet ending has become a worldwide sensation.  Vastly superior to the subsequently released  and disappointing Hollywood musical, ""Chicago"" (2002), which undeservedly won ""Best Picture"", ""Moulin Rouge"" appears to have revived Hollywoods interest in musicals.  ""Moulin Rouge"" creates a colorful magical world with remarkable sets, flashy costumes, delightful songs and an amazing cast who uniformly deliver riveting performances.  Nicole Kidman in a heartbreaking performance is the ill fated ""Satine"" who struggles with the choice between love or fame and fortune.  Ewan McGregor is touching as the heroic and naive young writer, ""Christian"", who fights for her love.  John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburg are all three incredible in meaty roles which are both unique and truly astounding.  Baz Luhrman has created a work of art which I have no doubt will in years to come be considered one of the classic films of all time.",Moulin Rouge!
213,marissas75,Aesthetics and emotion fused into one,10,20 January 2006,"I'll admit, it's hard for me to be objective about ""Moulin Rouge."" I've loved it since I saw it in the cinema, it was the first DVD I owned, and I still return to it. Every time, Baz Luhrmann's colorful, heartfelt, and sometimes overpowering film-making draws me into the movie's world of beautiful design and high emotion.Yes, the plot is a total cliché--a love triangle between penniless poet Christian, doomed courtesan Satine, and a sneeringly villainous Duke. ""Moulin Rouge"" is intelligent enough to winkingly acknowledge the melodrama at times (it also winks at some iconic bits of pop culture), but irony is not the film's prevailing mood. The actors play many scenes completely straight, speaking the sometimes-trite dialogue so earnestly that you come to believe it after all.And what marvelous performances! It's rare to find a male actor giving a performance as open and pure and vulnerable (and handsomely sung) as Ewan MacGregor's. Nicole Kidman gamely, and skillfully, does everything from low comedy to high tragedy to old-fashioned movie-star glamour. Jim Broadbent, playing the Moulin Rouge's owner Harold Zidler, finds unexpected depth and tenderness in his vulgar and blustering character.In many musicals, the songs are moments of heightened emotion, but are also designed to show off the actors' singing and dancing talent. ""Moulin Rouge,"" on the other hand, emphasizes emotion above all else. Yes, the corps of can-can dancers is excellent, and McGregor and Kidman sing very nicely, but the film-making, and the mood it evokes, is the true star. My favorite sequence, the ""Roxanne"" tango, encapsulates Luhrmann's technique. It's a wickedly clever use of a familiar song, turning it from a catchy, groovy little tune into something boiling over with tension and danger. The film rapidly cuts between the passionate tango dancers, Christian's heartfelt counter-melody, and a fight between Satine and the Duke in the tower, building to a climax where image, sound, and emotion fuse into one.The credo of the Bohemian characters, and of ""Moulin Rouge""'s creators, is ""Truth, beauty, freedom, and love."" I would argue that a fifth item should be added to that list: Art. The whole movie is about how life imitates art and art imitates life; how art can redeem and resurrect us; and most importantly, how art is central to the Bohemian credo. Art is ""fake,"" but it conveys a higher truth; art highlights life's beauty; artistic expression is a kind of freedom; art inspires love.""Moulin Rouge,"" a piece of film-as-art, does all those things.",Moulin Rouge!

Much of the film were done with the quick edit style of today's MTV video.

217,Shaolin_Apu,Love Humbug,8,23 June 2005,"Moulin Rouge! offers beautiful and red haired Nicole Kidman, who makes men crazy, me included. It also offers Ewan McGregor, who according to some female spectators, is so cute that it makes you yell IEEK! It also offers bits from good rock music, which forms part of the dialogue as well. Moulin Rouge! appears to be stunning musical and visual experience - a quantitative spectacle in every aspect. It's a movie for people who like it as big.In artistic sense this movie is nothing less than a headache. You'll recognize favourite songs from past decades in a new context, but the overall effect resembles too much a TV-Shop commercial of some Greatest Hits of the 70's compilation. You hear only tiny bits from famous songs and just few complete numbers. That is not to say that Moulin Rouge! is bad viewing, on the contrary! It is an orgy of colours, sounds and contrasts - a vehicle of complete entertainment that will satiate you whether you like it or not. There is, and hopefully never will be, another musical like this. Moulin Rouge is so unique that if Baz Luhrmann ever attempts to create anything like this again, he should be put into jail. Go and get it, but be prepared to run away if you don't want to get over-satiated.",Moulin Rouge!
218,Captain Ed,"Stick with it, and you will be rewarded",8,3 March 2002,"This is the type of movie that I am usually predisposed to dislike -- an overhyped production that starts off as a mess, which Moulin Rouge definitely does.  While the first 15 minutes of the film are almost unintelligible, they are visually stunning, and that was enough to keep me going.  After quite a while, the actual plot appears, and while it's hardly original, it provided a good framework upon which to hang all the rest of the weirdness that follows.An ensemble cast performs magnificently and that's the real attraction of Moulin Rouge.  Nicole Kidman redeems herself here as Santine, the courtesan with a heart of gold -- she's truly stunning, both as an actress and a vocalist.  Ewan MacGregor surprises me with his earnestness, vitality, and naivete as Christian, the young writer.  Jim Broadbent deserves his Oscar nomination as Zidler, the complicated proprietor of the Moulin Rouge.  On the other end of the spectrum, the Duke is played as Snidely Whiplash by Richard Roxbourgh with no shadings whatsoever, and John Leguizamo is just ridiculous as Toulouse-Lautrec, affecting both a poor French accent and a ludicrous lisp.However, the use of contemporary music (and mostly old pop songs) bothered me throughout the entire movie.  I don't believe that an original piece of music was presented until almost an hour had gone by.  Instead, we get several riffs on Elton John, the Beatles, the disco era -- ""Voulez-vous couchez avec moi""?  Come on.  It serves to pull this viewer out of the flow of the story.  I didn't really become absorbed until much later on, when the scenery stopped being so intrusive, the quick cuts and speed-up/slow-down effects subsided, and anachronistic songs gave way to some beautiful original work that actually had something to do with the story.  The choreography got pretty silly, too, especially toward the beginning.All in all, a visual feast and a belatedly engaging story combine with mostly brilliant performances to deliver a very entertaining film.  It's not my favorite, but I give it an 8.",Moulin Rouge!

Moulin Rouge is absolutely one of the wicked musical classic. Baz Luhrmann does something extraordinary here. The visualization is so magnificent, even though the story is so plain and common and has been rehash for many times. Nicole Kidman is adorable. Such an actress. Ewan McGregor is charming as always, but he does to learn more about singing. In general, Moulin Rouge is great. But, if you don't like a musical flick, I think you should avoid this, because you won't enjoying this flick much (I even have to watch it twice to enjoy it more completely).8/10",Moulin Rouge!
220,TheSeaLion,The term 'style over substance' was invented for this movie,3,2 January 2014,"""Moulin Rouge!"" is a film filled with glorious sets, vibrant colors, well choreographed dance and music sequences, memorable costumes, and an active atmosphere. Unfortunately, the same care that goes into the style of the film does not go into the romance or the plot. It can be fun to look at, but it is not fun when you are actually looking for something beyond the look of the film.The scenes are rich and festive, filled with a lot of eye candy and glamorous colors to get your attention. A problem with this is that the film is shot so quickly that you do not have time to admire the visuals and are instead assaulted with quick shot after quick shot of them that does not allow you to take it all in.The movie is more interested in showing off its visuals than it is at giving the audience a story that the visuals can all fall back on. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is our run-of-the-line tragic poet who came to Paris against his father's wishes and believes strongly in things like love. After one brief meeting with the Moulin Rouge's star, a courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman), Christian is in love. While at first she is not in love with Christian, singing a few parts from present day songs a few scenes later makes her realize she is in love. Unfortunately for the two, Satine must sleep with the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) if she is to get out of the Moulin Rouge and become a real star. These events gives off one of the most clichéd love triangles of film history.By the end of the film, the plot of ""Moulin Rouge"" has gotten more out of hand than its visuals. The love triangle gets out of hand with nonsensical character motivations and the characters acting dumb. Christian and Satine plan to run off together because the Duke will not allow them to be together, but once she discovers she's dying they can't run off together for some reason. Before that happens, a background character with no reason to not want Christian and Satine together reveals their relationship to the Duke and torments Christian over the fact that Satine has to be with the Duke. By the end, the characters are out of this world, acting stupid, insane, or having sudden random motivations that make no sense.""Moulin Rouge"" is an assault on your eyes and ears, bombarding you with non-stop visuals and loud noises with very few quiet breaks in between to let what you've just watched sink in.

You cannot resist being impressed by the set design, decor, costumes, cinematography and all technical stuff. However, a day or two after seeing this movie, all I was left with was an impression of colors swirling before me and dancing and singing. The story!?! Well, it is easy enough to comprehend, but does it stay with you after a week. No, I don't think so. It is not involving enough somehow, even though it should be heart breaking.

225,GuyCC,A Surprisingly Bold Film.,9,2 June 2001,"Let's face it: It's hard to release a musical in these modern times if it's not animated or doesn't have the Disney name attached to it.  What worked as a staple in the '50's is all but shunned in the last few decades.  And now ""Moulin Rouge"" comes out.  Whether or not it will revitalize the musical genre remains to be seen, but at least it's something to take notice of.Well, yes and no.  Everyone I've heard critique this movie has said either you're going to love this film or hate it.  There's no middle ground.  And I think that's a fair assumption.  Some people just can't stand singing in a film.  I, however, really liked the film, but I heard a person or two grumbling as they walked out, wishing they had seen ""Pearl Harbor"" instead. But almost enough about my film-going experience.This film's look is as bright and flashy as the on-screen action itself. Huge elaborate sets, detailed costumes, special effects and numerous camera tricks definitely keep things interesting.  There were a lot of things that I liked about this movie.  Bear in mind that I studied film in college so I ""got"" a lot of visual tricks the director was trying to do.  I think it's going to be a little hard for some general audience to catch some of the attitudes and styles if you haven't watched a lot of films from the musical era, and even before that.  ""Moulin Rouge"" has a cartoony atmosphere to it at times, but you can tell the actors are having fun with their roles.Speaking of actors, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are exceptional in their roles.  I never would have thought either to have singing talent, but they do.  I was very surprised, and their acting complimented their singing very well.  The songs are clever, cycling through SEVERAL popular hits from several decades (often in the same song), which resulted in several laughs from the audience.  The rest of the supporting cast held their own as well. And thankfully, that amazingly obnoxious and overplayed (Hence why it's obnoxious) ""Lady Marmalade"" remake factors in and is spaced throughout the film for less than two minutes, and gratefully doesn't blare as the credits roll.  Thank God for keeping artistic integrity.  The previews and the radio make you think the whole movie is based around this one song.I think the film's biggest hang-up for me was due to the camera tricks.  It walked a very fine line between being amusing at times and very distracting. I nearly walked out on Luhrmann's camera antics in ""Romeo + Juliet"", but fortunately, he tones this down within the first 20 minutes.""Moulin Rouge"" is a hard film to recommend.  I liked it, but I can see reasons why people wouldn't.  But if anything, it's a film to see if you would like to see something a little different, or at least McGregor or Kidman display a new facet of their versatility.  Worth the risk of something out of the ordinary.",Moulin Rouge!
226,shaid,"Disappointing,because it had a huge potential",6,22 October 2001,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*Musicals. This kind of films have disappeared almost completely in the last 30 years of so.They were very popular in the 50's & 60's but from the 70's onward it is hard to find a good adaptation of a stage musical on the silver screen. The place is too short to explain why, but it has to do with the fact that musicals are a very unrealistic medium which didn't go well with the realistic themes that ruled the movie industry from the 70's.
I like musicals, some of my all time favorite films are musicals. So one can only imagine how delighted I was when I heard that Baz Luhrman was making a musical. For me he is the one director that can revive the musicals and bring it to a modern audience. However I have a mix feeling about the end result and it has to do with some of the decisions Luhrman took when he made the film. Some of his decisions are both to the advantage and to the disadvantage of the film.It should be said at this point that this is not a regular musical but a one that correspond with others musical and other forms of music. So the decision to build Paris and film everything on a set in Australia and not in actual Paris is a direct continuance to what use to be done in the old days. Some of the great musicals of the past were completely filmed in one of Hollywood's studio were all the set was build(beside in real Paris the end scene, the one with the gun, could never have happened). Also the prime decision to set the story among people and places who actually existed(i.e:Toulouse Lautrec, The Moulin Rouge and Monmartre)  was a good one, however this decision also back fire because Lautrec and his Bohemians were prominent in Paris of the 1899 but from the movie you can not understand how important their ideas were and anyone who doesn't know what they were talking about would have the impression that they were simply a caricature, which is how they are been portrayed in this film.Luhrman use modern songs instead of a completely new material. That for itself isn't bad. That may bring young audience, however again a one which turn against the film. Instead of using one song for each scene,Luhrman decided to build a layer of songs for most of the scenes. That way the film becomes a quiz: ""Which song is this? and which one is that?"". By using only a sentence from each song Luhrman manage to alienate the young audience who come expecting for his beloved tunes only to find out that he was cheated.(In the screening I was present,the young audience was slowly leaving because he lost interest).In several scenes there is only one song, and those scenes are the one that show what could have happened if that was the case all through the film(I am referring to the scenes where you can hear: Roxane,The Show Must Go On and to some extent also the ones where Like A Virgin,Your Song  and the Can Can are performed. They are the best scenes in the film and I can only wish that the whole film was like those scenes).Every scene is so packed with colors and movement that in a certain moment my eyes got so tired and I couldn't, any longer, pay attention to what happened on the screen.Shame , because there is so much going on and is composed in a way that meant to attract the eyes but the effect is quite the opposite.The acting is good in general, though as I said before the characters are merely caricatures and the actors are doing well with what they have, which is not much. Nicole Kidman is excellent as Satine and she sing well but not on the high notes. Ewan McGregor have a nice voice  but a little one dimensional and flat. Unfortunately Kidman put him under her shadow which result with a week character in compare to her Satine.Whether you go to this film or not it is your decision. You may like it or not. Just be prepared for what comes. I still hope that Luhrman will make another musical and that it would be better than this one.",Moulin Rouge!

I have to admit that this movie not even succeeded to be my favorite of the week !No question, the singing is okay, dialogue is good, and there are quite some nice jokes in it. But the movie does basically nothing but bathing the watcher in cliche, telling him or her such well hidden secrets such as 'there is nothing more important than love'. I really often felt quite bored by that.And the environment embarrassed me. The Moulin Rouge is actually nothing but a brothel in Paris ! A place where rich old men buy poor young girls. A prison. A shame for mankind. Whatever. But in the movie, it is treated with a glory as if it would be a kings palace !Too, many story parts couldn't raise my interest at all. The whole part with the jealously could, if at all, make me laugh. Whats the point there ? The man should have known that he is fallen into a whore ! What did he expect ? That she immediately transforms into an angel now ?In the end, 'Moulin Rouge' is nothing but a female counterpart to 'Fast and Furious'. Instead of action you get song and dance, and instead of coolness and freedom you get romance. But I liked the far more realistic characters from 'Fast and Furious' more than these boring stereotypes from 'Moulin Rouge'.",Moulin Rouge!

It's a whirlwind and a frenetic pastiche, and completely failed to grab me emotionally. The love story left me completely unmoved. Was there a single word of French spoken in this movie? Nothing about this film said ""Paris"" to me. I loved the idea of integrating modern songs into this setting, but with a few exceptions (most notably ""Like a Virgin"" and ""Gaite Parisienne""),  the results were contrived, gimmicky and awkward.  This is a computer driven film, shallow and superficial, aimed at teenagers. Too bad, as there are some great moments, especcally the opening and closing credits!  Things could have been improved greatly by a much better leading lady. But Nicole Kidman is absolutely terrible in this film.  She exhibited, in my opinion,  absolutely no charisma or charm whatsoever, and can't sing. Her part was too important to ignore. Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, is outstanding.

As an experimental musical film, it divided audiences who were either enthralled or bewildered by it. After Ewan McGregor (Christian) sings a line from ""The Sound of Music"" in 1899 Paris, it's becomes apparent that this film is different from the usual film and willing to try new ideas. Especially after Christian sings the first complete song of the film ""Your Song"" by Elton John to Satine (Nicole Kidman), you either accept the use of pop songs from the 1950's through 1990's in 1899 Paris or you don't. If you don't, the film will probably begin to lose it's hold on you.""Moulin Rouge"" became a most favorite film for me upon my first viewing of it shortly after it's theatrical release. I left the film feeling wonderfully entertained! The art direction, cinematography, costumes and Nicole Kidman's performance as Satine are all very impressive!As a discerning film buff, I consider ""Moulin Rouge"" to be an excellent film overall, however it has a notable flaw: a flaw that I accepted. How Satine and Christian fall in love is not at all convincing, however their feelings for each other, especially when they sing together, is convincing. ""Moulin Rouge"" is not a film about character development, it's a film that celebrates love with bursts of passion and romance!""Moulin Rouge"" is certainly a quirky, fast paced paced film that will not be to everyone's taste.

239,theskulI42,A would-be stage delight done a disservice on the screen.,5,28 November 2008,"Ah, Moulin Rouge!. The spectacle to end all spectacles, the film that supposedly revived the flagged musical genre. This is the film that presumably, generations down the line, begat Julie Taymor's Across the Universe, a film that is obvious, poorly-acted, one-dimensional, patchwork, and frequently damn silly. It was also a film that was gloriously captivating, thanks to its tremendous visual sensibility, the soaring musical arrangements and the confidence in the material to play it seriously and believe that it would still succeed on its merits. Moulin Rouge! is a film that has so many of the same drawbacks, but fails to support its failings as Taymor did. The film is very, VERY bright and excited, but makes it mistake in thinking that being loud and obnoxious is the same as being vibrant and spectacular.Even with this, the film's main problem is that it's so goddamn cheeky. It picks songs that they know an audience will giggle about hearing played orchestrally (""Wouldn't it be funny if we had Jim Broadbent sing ""Like a Virgin""?"" ""Ahahaha, genius"") and then have every single actor play DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA, which apparently allows them to throw of all pretence of subtlety and pummel each line into cheap-chuckle submission, with only Ewan McGregor coming out unscathed. Not a single action is taken for the characters' benefit, not a single line is said because it's realistic in context; every single beat is insistently directed straight to the audience's ugly mugs, just to make SURE that they have a good, cheap laugh, or are aware that they're singing another song the audience should know. ""REMEMBER THAT ONE?! HO HO, YOU LOVED THAT SONG, WASN'T THAT FUNNY?!"" It's only one the nonsense calms down (for instance, during the 'love medley' does the film become anywhere near the sort of subtle, delicate sweetness that makes for a touching love scene.It's a lot like being on stage, really, and trying to appeal directly to the base, the simple, the Groundlings, if you will, and, perhaps not coincidentally, the only time the film gets any real traction, is when they move the film...to the stage! The audience, the lights, the sound, and especially the improvisation! In fact, this finale is so tremendously rousing that it damn near saves the entire film (and will probably garner it an entire half-point in my score. The fact is, this is a film that would be a spectacular-spectacular theatrical revue, but people, at least, this person, looks for completely different things from the stage and the screen. I was part of a local theatrical production called Everyman, which was a stupid, simplistic story (the kind where characters' personalities are in their names) held up by our director's choice of cheesy, obvious pop songs, but thanks to energy and the buzz amongst the crowd, the show was a rousing success, and many of those famous songs I have come to closely associate with that show. But it would lose everything on the screen, because despite their similarities, they're wholly different mediums, and trying to do something so suited for one in the realm of the other just results in inconsistent, unholy mediocrities like Moulin Rouge!.{Grade: 5.5/10 (C+/C) / #60 (of 68) of 2001}",Moulin Rouge!
240,RolloTomasi,Ladies and gentlemen: the future,10,27 June 2001,"In the category of how about that' : the most technically advanced film in some time is set in 1899. Baz Luhrmann's purpose is to capture the energy and spirit of that time period, portraying the Moulin Rouge as the Ultimate Party of that or any day. The belief is that back then people were less inhibited, less guarded than now. A slight disappointment is that there is only one scene showing the club in all its wanton glory. Shortly after, it's converted into a theater for the ""Spectacular Spectacular."" The first club scene is milked for all it's worth, though. This is electric, eye-popping cinema that really pulls you into the story. It would have been tough to top.The story isn't the most imaginative ever, but sticks to the format of the musical romance out of necessity. The film works so well because the story is so simple. Anything more complex would be lost in the kinetic pace of the visuals. ""Moulin Rouge"" is really like a roller coaster: one second you're moving slow and easy, the next you're blasted forward a hundred miles an hour. Even if another director could have thought up some of the visual ideas Luhrmann comes up with, they'd likely dismiss them as impossible to pull off. The film is like nothing you've ever seen before and yet, oddly familiar at the same time.  Luhrmann seems determined to give you something cool to look at every second. You're literally afraid to blink for fear of missing the slightest thing. The super zoom' is a marvel to watch, the shot that starts miles away from its target, then pulls you forward at light speed until you're right on top of it. But this isn't all just computer wizardry. It's how the director, for instance, will use two different color filters in one shot, or adds energy to a scene by editing together shots filmed at different speeds. Astonishing. I'm an Oscar junkie so I'm always looking out for films that will tempt the almighty Academy. Certainly the best film of the year so far, I could see ""Moulin Rouge"" nearly running the table: Sound, visual effects, cinematography, editing, directing, original song for ""Come What May,"" acting for Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo (who somehow plays a dwarf). An original score nomination would be a toughie, as Luhrmann pieces this one together from thirty or so classic songs from several genres, re-imagining them in the context of this story. I'll probably be proven wrong as the inevitable crop of quality movies enter the fold beginning in August. One thing is sure, though: ""Moulin Rouge"" will not be forgotten.Grade: A",Moulin Rouge!

Usually, I feel that the songs in musicals halt the story, and become boring when the chorus is said for the fifth time... But it is not the same thing with Moulin Rouge!. First of all, the collection of popular songs that have been used to create the songs from Moulin Rouge! have the word ""variety"" written all over them. Lady Marmalade meets Smells Like Teen Spirits! The Police, The Beatles, Nirvana, Madonna... The list of bands and artists goes on and on... And everything is really well done! Even better, the story is being told by the songs instead of simply being repeated... But even better than the music is the visual style of the movie. If Luhrmann's camera moved too fast for you in Romeo and Juliet, don't even think about watching Moulin Rouge! without getting a headache. Everything feels larger than life, everything is moving. Beautiful colors invade the screen. This movie is a visual treat. Even better: the acting is actually quite good. Ewan McGregor, an actor I really like, is great and is on screen chemistry with Nicole Kidman is impressive. They are a great couple. And Kidman is beautiful, even more so than she usually is, which says a lot. This only makes it more credible that every man dreams of her. As a movie couple, Christian and Satine are fantastic. Luhrmann might be behind this, as Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were another great on-screen couple in his previous movie. And John Leguizamo is impressive in the relatively small part of Toulouse-Lautrec. And lets not forget Jim Broadbent, as Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge!, another great addition to the cast. The most sursprising thing about Moulin Rouge!, though, might be the fact that the cliché story is actually quite touching. Basically, this could have been called ""Romeo and Juliet Go To The Moulin Rouge"", but everyone takes the classic storyline to life with such passion, and the characters are so effective that you dont mind the fact that you have been told a similar story quite a few times. From the beginning of the movie, Christian says that the story will end sadly, but you nevertheless keep hoping... Basically, this love story is much better than 1997's ""Romeo and Juliet Are On A Boat"", also known as Titanic. So the music is great, the acting is great, the story is involving and the movie is visually stunning. What more can you ask?87%",Moulin Rouge!

The supporting cast also provide a lot of delightful moments. However, a few bits were just too smarmy , with not enough tongue in cheek.

244,shahrad,Dazzling,10,14 July 2001,"If you want to watch all the entertaining elements in one movie you should watch Moulin Rouge. MR is a dazzling picture which offers whatever you desire. Enchanting girls, colours, movements, energy, love story , music and so on. I describe the movie as: Enchants the eyes. But, some scenes seem to be week written. Sometimes their love is a little bit ridiculous. An amazing thing about this film is the music. It successfully presents a mixture of today Pop and Rock music which makes Moulin Rouge a distinguished movie. The story takes place in the early 20th century, and it was wonderful to hear The Sound of Music song a this time, when it hadn't been released yet. Nicole Kidman has a natural talent to perform sexy and erotic roles. She is magnificent in this movie and a good choice for this character. I just can't understand why Tom Cruise broke up with such a lady.",Moulin Rouge!
245,kinolieber,"Not perfect, but achieves greatness",9,7 June 2001,"This is one of those films that you simply HAVE TO SEE. NOW. ON A BIG SCREEN. There's really never been anything like it, but I'll make the following comparisons: 2001 A Space Odyssey, Pennies From Heaven, The Wizard of Oz.  Films that pushed the previous boundaries of cinema so far, technically AND artistically, and in such surprising and imaginative ways, that they inspired a kind of happy giddiness at the sheer awesomeness of what film can do. Films that provided so much sheer visceral pleasure that you wanted to go back and see them again almost immediately.
Since the film is now in release, I will not say anything specific about the it. Surprise and delight are so much a part of its fun. I will say this. It's not perfect, though maybe after repeated viewings I will change my mind. Not everything works. Aspects of it are unexceptional. Yet, even if only succeeding half the time, it deserves a place among the great films of our time.",Moulin Rouge!
246,comquest,A Circus of Weirdos,1,3 February 2002,"'Moulin Rouge!' is, without doubt, one of the ten worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  It's loud, annoying and senseless with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.Though it's billed as a 'musical', most of the music is drowned out by sheer noise.  And the musical directors cast historical accuracy to the wind as we hear contemporary songs including 'Lady Marmalade' and 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' performing in Paris of the 1890s(?)!  What schlock!As much as I usually love Nicole Kidman, even she could not salvage this awful movie for me.  A Golden Globe ... !?!  C'mon.  Nicole should have won a Globe and an Oscar for her performance in 'Dead Calm', but certainly not for this unadulterated mess.  The acting ... by everyone on-screen ... is so irritatingly hammy that it cries out for brown sugar sauce. Yuk!What were they thinking!?!",Moulin Rouge!
247,gbrumburgh,One colossal little love story.,8,2 June 2001,"The vivid, vibrant, highly graphic strokes and style of French impressionist Toulouse-Lautrec was inspired by the colorful night life of the Montmartre district of Paris -- the circuses, the brothels(!), but notably the Moulin Rouge cabaret which he frequented often and became a routine host to an elite, partygoing bunch of artistic intellects and deviants.  Were he alive today, he could very well have been reinspired by this ambitious recreation of the Moulin Rouge 100 years later.  A mammoth, toyingly libidinous piece of escapism to be certain, the painter would simply revel in the outre, over-the-top, visually assaultive mind of its creator writer/director Baz Luhrmann.I, too, was quite bowled over by this ""everything but the kitchen sink"" extravaganza, although not always as ecstatically as I would have wanted to be, but certainly enough to appreciate the intentions of this masterful deluge of gaudy Gallic grandeur circa 1899.Refreshingly original (the previews had me fooled), what did NOT race through my categorical mind while experiencing this film!  In its initial stage, the love story seemed to borrow its concept directly from Christopher Isherwood's ""Berlin Stories,"" specifically the Sally Bowles ""Cabaret""-inspired chapter in which a naive, struggling writer recalls (via his typewriter) his doomed love affair with a capricious entertainer who got caught up in the phony glitz and decadent glamour around her.  But from then on, it was anybody's guess.  A potpourri of other musical shows and films flashed through my mind --from the typical (Jose Ferrer's ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""Can-Can,"" ""Les Girls,"" ""An American in Paris"") to the more imaginative and surreal (""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Fellini Satyricon,"" Fosse's ""All That Jazz,"" the phantasmagorical ""Yellow Submarine"", anything Gilbert & Sullivan-ish, and Disney's ""Aladdin"").  Don't even ask me why on some of these.Nicole Kidman's Satine could have easily been based on the life of the indelible French star Renee Adoree, a one-time circus performer who became a Folies Bergere dancer.  She subsequently was ushered to Hollywood and illuminated one classic love story, ""The Big Parade"" with John Gilbert, that remains a silent screen treasure.  A frail beauty, Renee died in her mid-30s of tuberculosis/consumption.Once the incessant battering by the camera's eye took a breather and I was allowed to actually focus on something tangible -- like the love story -- I found the enticing, highly photogenic Kidman, coupled with Ewan McGregor's honest-guy Christian, to be quite affecting as a pair, even moving.  And that wasn't easy.  The visual bombardment and gimmicky use of modern songs constantly threaten to isolate the viewer from the film's emotional core. Fortunately, it did not succeed.Speaking of, the use of contemporary pop and classic rock songs worked better at the beginning when it was a novelty but, of course, the pattern eventually wore out its welcome as I started spending my time ingenously thinking about what next classic hit should be used for the present scene -- much like the so-so musical ""Mamma Mia!"" wherein a series of Abba songs are thrown together (very weakly) to create a ridiculous storyline.  I thought the ""Material Girl"" number (despite the engaging presence of Jim Broadbent's bombastic impresario, Zidler, and Richard Roxburgh's oily villain, the Duke of Worchester) was stretching a potential good idea too far.  However, Kidman's breathy song stylings and, especially, McGregor's sturdy pop tenor handled the love songs quite effectively.As for the handling of simple little love stories, however, I sincerely hope Luhrmann doesn't get any ideas by setting his sights on a remake of ""The Fantasticks.""  I don't think the fragile little story could take it!",Moulin Rouge!
248,Jeremy Bristol,A Spectacular Spectacular without Spectacular Characters (Spoilers),6,28 April 2002,"Baz Luhrmann has been quoted (or was it one of the producers?) as saying he was trying to make a musical for the future.  Well, how can one make even a modern musical when the heroine is dying of consumption (i.e. tuberculosis, same as Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy).  I can just see Susan Sontag bringing out a new edition of her essay-book ""Illness as Metaphor"" just to combat this movie's totally old-fashioned depiction of a woman dying beautifully from consumption (doesn't she *just* glow when she coughs up blood?).  Countless stories over the years (at least according to Sontag) have ended with these romanticised, tragic literary deaths (more recently, these deaths are from AIDS or cancer).Another thing that makes Moulin Rouge! old-fashioned is the fact that the music is (almost?) entirely pre-existing, most from the Eighties (two whole songs by Madonna) and some even older (""Sound of Music"" and ""My Song,"" both of which were apparently written by Christian, not Rodgers and Hammerstein and Barry Taupin and Elton John).  In fact, in many ways, the movie seems to be a relic of the Eighties--like Ferris Bueller, the villain is a loud obnoxious clown of a person, while the heroes are young and more ""honest"" (supposedly exemplified by the midget/sitar that ""can tell no lies"").  In the end, the movie is just a rehash-on-speed of Titanic, all the way down to the frame that indicates who lives and who dies at the very beginning.6 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!
249,gerry-russell-139,"'Come what may', ""Moulin Rouge"" gives new life to the musical genre",10,6 June 2001,"Baz Luhrmann (""Strictly Ballroom"", ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"") now directs his third film... another ""upper class"" flick with posh sets, flashy costumes and a ""to die for"" Nicole Kidman with a cherry pie mouth and a sumptuous red gown to match. Ewan McGregor is her leading man, Christian, a penniless poet/writer with enough thespian abilities to match his talents given to the pen. She is Satine, a French courtesan and the star of the flamboyant, garish underworld club known as the Moulin Rouge. She immediately becomes his muse, they fall in love and he writes the club's next production called ""Spectacular, Spectacular"". The only thing that stands in their way is the Duke of Worcester who takes over the production and instructs Zidler, the emcee, that Satine may be the star of the show but she must also belong exclusively to him as well. This sets the turning point in the story and it becomes a whirlwind of spinning colors and so much dizzy editing that one can barely keep up. Ewan McGregor (you may not automatically recognize him, given that he does give the impression of looking somewhat like Ray Liota in some lights and a bit like a young Richard Burton in others) surprises all with his natural gift of song and Nicole Kidman does the same, though her voice is somewhat thin. Many of the songs are cloned from popular tunes of the seventies, eighties and nineties (i.e. ""Your Song"", ""Up Where We Belong"", ""I Will Always Love You"", ""Roxanne"", etc., plus ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend""). A standout, however, is the theme song ""Come What May""-- a slightly corny, but endearing love song that Kidman and McGregor perform throughout the film, most notably at the climax of ""Spectacular, Spectacular"". For romantics its a perfect date flick, for musical-lovers its a happy-sad romp, and for ones who like McGregor or Kidman its worth as many looks as you can afford. It calls to mind a long-dead genre but it might just revolutionize it and give it a whole new form. Unlike the failed, but still well-made EVITA, MOULIN ROUGE! doesn't drag (though some might find the first twenty-five to thirty minutes a bit avant-garde) and you leave the theater wanting to go out and buy the soundtrack.

250,BatBanks,Over-the-Top Musical,4,29 October 2019,"Moulin Rouge is a musical comedy/romance/drama about a young British writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor) travel in France and fall in love with the star attraction cabaret/courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman). The love affair is doomed at the beginning because of two reasons: 1.) The duke who can finance improvements to Moulin Rouge by turned into a theater and he lust for Satine. 2.) Satine is dying.Everyone in the movie can not sing and ruins the classic songs from the 50's and the 80's. Nicole Kidman is miscast as the lead, she is neither sexy or pretty and her acting in this annoying why on earth did she get nominated for her performance. The scenes with her moaning is rip-off of When Harry Met Sally, it really show she's a lousy actress. Ewan McGregor and John Leguizamo are talented actors but they were wasted in the film. McGregor good looks and charms kept the film going.The acting is bad and over the top cartoonish performances and more up close of grotesque people working in Moulin Rouge.

253,EdYerkeRobins,The Stylishly Anti-Period Period Piece,8,15 January 2002,"Perhaps the greatest satisfaction as a movie watcher is a film that shatters all negative expectations for it.  I came into ""Moulin Rouge!"" with a huge bias, due simply to the horrid cover of ""Lady Marmalade"" on MTV and the radio, which was my only exposure to the movie.  Were it not for my friend's older sister reassuring me that the song was only in the actual movie for one sequence of a few minutes at most, I never would've seen it at all.  I'm glad I listened to her, because this is a colorful, musical masterpiece, though at times its a little messy.The cornerstone of ""Moulin Rouge!"", being a musical of sorts, is the music. Most of the film's musical numbers are not original, and are composed of resung samples from songs ranging from U2 to Elton John (its fun just trying to see how fast one can recognize the sample).  While a few of these are cute, others are strange and/or just too much (the whole bit from ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was so absurd I had to laugh, but the Madonna made me groan).  Probably the best musical sequence is Fatboy Slim's hard hitting ""Can Can"" (although ironically enough, this is the aforementioned sequence with the dreaded ""Lady Marmalade"", luckily it is mostly drowned out by the beat) that looks and feels like a modern club.  However, that is what makes most of these sequences so odd; why bother setting the film in 1900 as a period piece if the music and choreography totally remove it from that era?
Besides the music, the film's grand atmosphere comes from the stunning visuals.  This is Baz Luhrmann at his best and every editor's worst nightmare; every club/rehearsal/play scene packs in enough color, lights, and costumes to put Cirque du Soleil to shame.  Its not just that these scenes feature so many things going on, but that the collage of it all is put together so ""efficiently""; most of the time it feels necessary, as opposed to just filler (there are still moments where the film seems more like a long string of music videos as opposed to a film, though not as many as I would've expected).  On that rare occasion when a sequence turned out sloppy, however, all the overindulgence causes the film to cough up some awful cinematographic vomit (though this only happened once or twice to the point where it really bothered me, mostly from the camera jumping around and switching sequences too much).  Unfortunately, since each sequence is so big (if anything, they get bigger and bigger throughout the film) all this simply adds up to too much to see and digest in just one viewing, so, as brilliant as they are, only the grandest of these grand sequences will leave an impression (but what an impression it is!).Underneath all this style, amazingly enough, is a movie (albeit a weak one).  Though the plot is cliche-ridden (the most disappointing thing about the movie) and obviously depends on its visual/audio sequences to keep interest (tons of style makes up for an almost total lack of substance), it is held afloat by some excellent supporting performances from Richard Roxburgh, Jim Broadbent, and whomever played Christian's eccentric Bohemian artist colleagues/neighbors.  Though their acting wasn't lacking, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman should really be commended for their singing performances, which were much better than I could have ever hoped.""Moulin Rouge!"" was a pleasant surprise, but there is just too much to handle.  Although I did enjoy it, its thorough lack of anything interesting in the plot (I had the whole thing telegraphed within the first half hour) and constant one-up-manship over itself will ensure that for repeated viewings its more worth it to just skip through and watch your favorite sequences (the aforementioned ""Can Can"" and the ending) again, rather than the whole film.",Moulin Rouge!

Here, Luhrmann achieves what some may have thought impossible: constant cinematic exhilaration. While he has many weaknesses as a director, (namely his penchant toward melodrama and bombast) all of his cinematic traits meld together here to form a masterpiece that is essentially a glorious mish-mash of all aspects of 20-th century culture.

What a joy it must have been to work with him on this ambitious project. He took the simple theme of ""Love"" and made it into something ravishing, seductive and new. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were outstanding in their heartfelt portrayals. This rendition of storytelling was offbeat and new - but it was brilliant. My hat goes off to this production team for their effort at making this come off successfully (not just in terms of box office success but more importantly in artistic merit). The collage of musical numbers put together would have been more than enough for most movie producers to handle but this film enjoys many avenues of delightful artistic achievement that it would take a small volume just to review the highlights of them all. Using the singing voices of the actors lends an air of authenticity and realism which pays off handsomely with a successful emotional tugging at the heartstrings. This is as successful an artistic attempt as ""Chicago"" the musical is a failure. Hollywood just knee-jerked a reaction the following year to this ""foreign"" film by producing ""Chicago"" which has absolutely no storyline of consequence and certainly no artistic worthiness. The acting is pathetic and Hollywood failed in its attempt to come back with a superior film to ""Moulin Rouge"", although they gave it every award under the sun to save face. Doesn't pride come before a fall? The fact is Hollywood is not producing the best films anymore and they just cannot accept it. Too bad! Maybe it is time for them to clean up their act! Good Luck to them! Meanwhile ""Moulin Rouge"" stands out as a beacon of light and hope for the future of movie-making around the world.

259,jean-no,I'm not sure,7,13 April 2002,"What to think of it ? Moulin Rouge mixes times and cultures with no respect of anything, and it's fun. Seeing the mythic Zidler, Moulin Rouge's owner, singing Madonna's ""like a virgin"" song to fool a jealous duke, yes, it's fun. Some visual effects are brilliant, really, and Kylie Minogue, in her twenty seconds cameo as a ""absynth spirit"" is great too. The whole decoration is great too. Now the bad thing : the storyline is simple, but at no moment I wanted to believe in it, I never felt concerned with the love story, Nicole Kidman plays like a fish : wet big eyes but a few expressivity (maybe not her fault : the role is not very well written). The camera does too much slow motions, it makes go sea sick. Sometimes, the camera can't stay showing a still thing more than one second and that is not very enjoyable too. I'm sure this mvie could have been much much better with a real director : Luhrmann has strong visions, good ideas (too much ideas maybe), but he is not a great director for me, I felt exactly the same with Romeo+Juliette.

Rarely have I seen such a visually impressive and dynamic film and after the first few minutes I was hooked! I was impressed mostly by the images, but also by the performances and music. The story might be nothing new, but all the other ingredients of the film lift it above many other love stories. This is definitely one of the best performances Nicole Kidman has ever given.      Now I´m seriously thinking about buying the soundtrack and the DVD which seems to be loaded with special features. I already have the single Come What May which is a stunning ballad performed by Nicole and Ewan McGregor. Those two really know how to sing.

My favorite part would have to be when Satine sings ""I'll Fly Away"" followed by many different songs with Christian.  The Roxanne scene near the end is also awesome.

265,RJBose,Three Movies in One: All of them Bad,2,9 June 2001,"The Moulin Rouge is a theater in Paris known for its elaborate and and somewhat racy shows, now a favorite for tourists visiting the city (I myself have fallen into that category).  With all of the media attention bestowed on this project because of Nicole Kidman, and the fact that this was a musical, I was curious to see how it had turned out (plus my girlfriend wanted to go).The film begins quite promisingly, with an elaborate computer generation of Paris in 1899, including some whimsical touches, showing very interestingly the area of Paris in which the Moulin Rouge (""Red Windmill"" in English) is found.  I was reminded immediately of Tim Burton's work, with the attention to detail, and slightly surrealistic atmosphere; (I was also reminded of Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" with its rooftops of London scenes). This alone makes the movie worth seeing (well, almost).The movie starts out cheerfully, and somewhat goofily, in a good natured way, to introduce the protagonist, an aspiring writer on sojourn from London.  When he begins to sing ""The Hills are Alive (With the Sound of Music)"" as suggested lyrics for a show on which his bohemian upstairs neighbors are laboring to produce for the proprietor the Moulin Rouge, the movie takes a turn into what I thought was parody, but sadly, was a harbinger of what to expect for the next two hours.Nicole Kidman is a prostitute employed by the moulin Rouge as a singer, but she refers to herself (and her occupation) by the more noble sound epithet of ""courtesan"".  This may elevate in some way her status in the film, but unfortunately for her, it does nothing to help her singing, which is generally on the level of a medium sized high school musical.  Editing techniques vary from styles lifted directly from the (very) old 1960's TV show The Monkees"" to the frenetic MTV music video genre.  All of this is pasted onto a very tired old plot about star-crossed lovers and a buffoonish wealthy rival for Miss Kidman's affections. Anachronistic uses of modern songs become jarring, like some Saturday Night Live skit that drags on and on; (some in the audience laughed heartily, blissfully unaware that it wasn't supposed to be funny).By the film's end, it is nothing more than a poorly scored and overbloated opera, or Shakespearean tragedy.",Moulin Rouge!
266,ayric,"Mixed Feelings, But Mostly Impressed",8,21 December 2001,"I am thrilled about and a little bit mad at this movie. The film is mostly spectacular, but unfortunately Baz Luhrmann is not only a fabulous filmmaker; he is also a raving lunatic. This could easily have been the best musical of all-time, but crazy and unfunny humor constantly ruins the rhythm of the film. Extremely annoying, but I managed to ignore it as the film went on. The musical scenes are absolutely fantastic. They are either explosive (as in the scene where the Moulin Rouge is introduced, powered by Fatboy Slim's Because We Can) or beautifully romantic. The soundtrack is a must-buy. I am usually a little troubled by musical scenes but in this film they work much better than the scenes where the music is absent. Nicole Kidman is as enchanting as ever, but surprisingly enough, Ewan McGregor ends up being the scene stealer. This is his best performance to date. He really makes you root for him. I think this is the best portrayal of ""boy in love"" I have seen. Luhrmann messed up ""The greatest love story ever told"" in Romeo + Juliet, but this time he makes it almost right with what must be the second greatest love story ever told. The ending is just as hopelessly sad as in Shakespeare's story, and that proves much stronger than any happy ending. All the visual aspects make for great eyecandy. Paris is portrayed as a dreamy and beautiful city just as it is in Amelie. Nothing like the reality, but that's fine. I suspects quite a few technical Oscar nominations for this film and also, of course, some musical nominations. I can't wait to see Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman duet Come What May at the show.I was, as I said, much troubled by the comical elements of the film, and would have absolutely adored a purely dramatic cut of the film, but if you manage to see past that (or if you are one of the few who share Luhrmann's twisted form for humor), you are in for a treat.

Instead of a voyeuristic approach the director had the guts to actually throw me smack in the middle of the actual stage without so much as a warning.At first I plucked my eyebrows but it was simply irresistible. Moulin Rouge! is loud, outrageous... and deeply moving.The heart of the movie is a classic opera-style tale filled with romance, deceit, treachery and death. The form however is far removed from anything I have ever seen. The musical accompaniment is a skillful medley right across twentieth century music. What to think of a room filled with men in cylinder hats dancing to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana?. If Verdi lived in our time, would this have been his approach? Who knows, and who cares. I could never get enough of this exuberant, rich and yet somehow sober performance.The acting is excellent, with outstanding roles by Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent. The director is both ubiquitous and subtly withdrawn. Ubiquitous in the loving care that went into every detail. Withdrawn in the strict adherence to the self-set rules of the story and the way it is told. Not once do you tell yourself: ""Hey wait a minute, this is a movie! I am sitting in a theatre, and this isn't real!""The story is told in one long trait. At the intermission I actually felt like having had desert, and still had half the movie to go.To finish off the compliments, the movie, besides being a real tearjerker, is simply great fun. You can't miss the scenes where the rotund theatre director sings ""Like a Virgin"". And it works!Don't miss Moulin Rouge!",Moulin Rouge!
268,Baldach,1980's music in a story set in 1880's??,1,18 March 2002,"I will be blunt I severly disliked Moulin Rouge. The main reason is that the film had the character from the 1880's singing various songs from the 1980's. Potential Spoiler uphead.  To hear Richard Roxburgh sing the song ""Like a Virgin"" by Madonna, makes a ground glass in a garbage disposal sound pleasant. The tragic love story line in the movie was decent, however the historical inaccuracies of the music severly damaged the movie in my humble opinion.",Moulin Rouge!
269,underfire35,A Nauseating Film........,1,8 March 2003,"MOULIN ROUGE is quite simply a physical assault on the senses.  The viewer is attacked with pop-culture sensibilities and a highly marketable soundtrack. This is not helped by the director, Baz Luhrmann, who will not let you forget that you are watching a film directed by Baz Luhrmann.  Enough, we get it, you have a distinct visual style, that's great...now make a watchable film.  I made it about half-way through his ROMEO + JULIET before I had to take half a white valium. This ""resurgence of the musical"" simply sweeps an arm across Billboard Music's top twenty list and arranges such classics as 'Like a Virgin' and 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' as over-directed large-scale musical numbers...wow.  This film vomits garish style and dated cinematic techniques to the point where it becomes unbearable.I understand that Nicole Kidman's character was supposed to be vampish, but c'mon, Elvira had more nuance than this.  Ewan McGregor is the only one who narrowly escapes this mess (although he should not sacrifice his film career for one in music).  There are more characters doing jerky, sped-up backflips than any one person should have to tolerate in a single production.  The story...huh, was there a story?  If there was, Baz Luhrmann did not handle it very well. A trendy, self indulgent waste of time.   1/10Quick Story: While viewing this film in the theater, I was so overwhelmed with desperation, that I unlaced my boot and crafted a make-shift noose.  I proceeded to wear this about my neck all through the movie and continued to do so following the film.  I got some strange looks from my fellow movie-goers, who seemed to have enjoyed MOULIN ROUGE.",Moulin Rouge!
270,iamyuno2,Poorly Thought Out - Doesn't Even Work As A Musical,1,3 January 2014,"This movie - to me (and I know I differ with most others on this movie) - is precisely how NOT to make a musical. For one thing - did they have to use old songs? There was something odd about that, and how they used them, that, to me, made this the #1 corniest musical of all time. Could they not have hired a talented songwriter or team of songwriters to craft songs that actually pertained to the story? That would have been nice. The acting, too, is really clichéd. Even fine actors like Nicole Kidman come off badly here. Director Baz Luhrmann was going for some stylistic quirk that just made me want to gag. Poor acting is the result. The story line is SO hokey, too - and one that you've seen hundreds if not thousands of times. Nothing new here...it's SO predictable as to make you wonder: how much thought did writers Luhrmann and Pearce put into this thing? Like the reused songs from times past, this story is a retread of a retread. I am shocked anyone thought this was anything but a boring sappy work of an inferior mind.",Moulin Rouge!
271,SamRag,Dear to be touched,10,15 August 2002,"There are few films that have affected me in the same way as Moulin Rouge does.  You rent, or go to the movies, and most of the time it is to be entertained for couple of hours, while forgetting your own struggles in life.  Here we have a film that takes you beyond that, as you will completely forget everything and you become part of a wonderful love story in a movie which is unlike anything I've ever seen.  When I first heard about Moulin Rouge, I didn't expect much.  Nicole Kidman has always disappointed me, with the only two films I've liked her in being Far and Away & Eyes Wide Shut.  Ewan McGregor has, even for his talent, not always delivered, and is Star Wars the saddest example.  To top this, I just couldn't imagine a Musical to be worth seeing.  I mean beside old films like Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, West Side Story and Grease, are there any real musicals out there?  All my doubts were swept away seeing Moulin Rouge for the first time.  It grabs you, and doesn't let go until many days later. The combination of music that we all partly know performed in a new way, the visual settings and camera work, the strange combination of comedy, drama, reality and fantasy.  All fantastically well put together, brings us a film unlike any others.  I dear to say that if you hate it, you didn't allow it to capture you, deciding rather to stay out of range, untouched and unharmed.  For all the rest of you, enjoy the journey. 10/10",Moulin Rouge!
272,Cheetah-6,Speechless,10,30 June 2001,"Somebody said ""writing about music is like dancing about architecture"". That seems to fit here. Words fall short.

You take your chances.",Moulin Rouge!

Ewen's performance is masterful- Nicole was somewhat weird, but still amazing.  Ultimately, slam-dunk Set Design, Cinematography, Sound, and Lighting Oscar nods for this film- perhaps even a best supporting actor nod to Ewen.  All in all a great film- you gotta love the bohemian salutes to freedom, truth, beauty, and, of course, love.",Moulin Rouge!
274,Just-Being-Me,A great love story,8,4 March 2014,"If you like romance and music then this is the film for you. You either love it or you hate it, i personally love it. It made me smile, it made me cry, i enjoyed the singing and the songs, i enjoyed the story. I thought each part was well acted. Ewan and Nicole are amazing anyway but in this film they show their acting skills and their singing skills, yes Nicole is a better singer than Ewan but they are still both good. I can't really fault the film much, bits where a bit too dramatic and far fetched but it made no difference to me as the storyline made up for it.I think 8 out of 10 is a good rating as there is always room for improvement but i would definitely recommend to people who like the typical romantic musical.",Moulin Rouge!

I was in my late thirties when this film came out, if I had of watched it then, my opinion may have been different. I say this, because the film does seem to be aimed at a younger audience.
Moulin Rouge, has some fine actors whose performance in other films are worth watching. In this film, the cast are overwhelmed by constant, random musical interludes (yes I know it's a musical). The narrative is lost, because the film dosen't pause for breath. After 19 minutes of this, we had to switch it off. Its back to the charity shop for this one.",Moulin Rouge!

The lead couple was wonderful, maybe it seems strange to say this, but maybe that great actress, which has proven herself since so many times, should have not appeared so... perfect. Although she was and could. The other disagreement adresses the option for excess in colour, operatic excess, like a rococó experience. Why have by express choice waited such a long time to see the movie... devil may care. Congratulations and especially to our Diva. All was wonderful but maybe, too much? That was a direction decision, and has satisfied the most. I would opt for something a little more sober about the portrait of that historic location...",Moulin Rouge!

It's funny, moving, with cracking songs and dances (I love the Can-Can espeially) and two of the most amazing actors on screen-Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor belting out the songs like theres no tommorow.

278,Mr_Mirage,"21st Century musical, style with substance",10,18 June 2001,"A film that is as packed with wild visual imagery as this one is usually accused of being devoid of meaning. In this case, the images assist the meaning.There is a feeling of being young in a new world, full of thousands of new sensory experience. When the hero realises that he is indeed in love, the film slows down, his new universe reduced to the two hearts beating in unison. As in many love stories, hearts are broken, and we are drawn in, closer and closer. This film is about people, their faces filling the screen. The camera lingers on the countenance of each of the players. Eyes predominate, letting us glimpse into the souls of these people.Hypnotic, mesmerizing and seductive, this work is worthy of, if not requiring, multiple viewings.",Moulin Rouge!
279,Junker-2,"Lots of razzle-dazzle, but where's the plot?",6,27 December 2001,"I was totally enthralled by the first half hour of ""Moulin Rouge."" It's a pure razzle-dazzle, whiz-bang, spectacular spectacular with so much going on in each frame that your eyes scarcely know where to look. I began to think I was watching what would turn out to be my favorite movie of 2001.But razzle-dazzle can only hide the lack of a plot for so long. 45 minutes into the movie I began to look at my watch. And for the last hour I was reduced to simply hoping the movie would hurry up and end already.Oh, sure. It does have a plot. I guess. Unfortunately the plot is only a sappy love story that we already know the ending to. How do we know the ending? Because we are told it in the opening minute of the movie. Why are we told the ending at the beginning? That's a very good question.Still, ""Moulin Rouge"" is a spectacular looking, well acted bit of razzle-dazzle that almost swept me away. Oh, for a real plot! Oh, for a real villain, instead of the non-threatening Duke who we are supposed to hate and fear! Oh, for an ending that could have kept me guessing! Had ""Moulin Rouge"" had those things, it may very well have been picking up Oscar after Oscar come March.Instead, for me at least, it will remain only an intriguing curiosity.",Moulin Rouge!

282,tvspace,Wow!,8,21 May 2001,"I'd like to be able to simply say ""wow"" and let you see the movie for yourself:Wow.However there are a lot of really ignorant reviews coming out about this wonderful movie so I will try to persuade you, dear visitor, why you should believe me and not Kenneth Turan of the LA Times, or whoever you are unfortunate enough to be saddled with in your local paper.Moulin Rouge is a post-modern, filmic ""La Boheme""; that is to say, it is an opera.  Unlike the opera you can see at your local Opera House, though, this movie is thoroughly contemporary, not only in its selection of music, but also in its organizing aesthetic, which is related to, but not derivative of, MTV music videos.As opera, in its heyday, incorporated elements of all the other arts (literature, music, theater, painting), Moulin Rouge, as a contemporary opera, incorporates the arts of our day:  all of the above, plus movies, rock and roll, and booty-shaking nightclub dancing.  In both the classic opera, and in Baz Luhrmann's movie, there is that sense of being confronted with a work that is pulling out all the stops, that is ""letting it rip"". It is an intimidating type of art if you are looking for a mildly pleasant diversion, but a richly rewarding one if you're willing to go along for the ride.A lot of reviews are criticizing the editing as being overly aggressive, too fast, jumpy, discombobulating.I think these reviewers, having correctly observed such irritating habits in director Luhrmann's last movie, ""Romeo + Juliet"", were, shall we say, overly sensitive to that issue before the movie even started, and have failed to appreciate the picture editing for what it is:  fast, yes, but smooth, propulsive, and functional.  The editors have created a Dadaist marvel that manages at the same time keeps you in touch with the story, the characters emotions, and the physical geography of each scene.  If there is ever a moment where physical space becomes abstract, it is by design, as the movie slides back and forth between traditional narrative space, and a presentational, music-theater aesthetic.Don't be misled:  this is not the kind of quote-unquote ""MTV editing"" that sours rotten action pics like ""ConAir"" and other assorted Hollywood crap. This is a visual tour de force that will take you on a nearly psychadelic voyage through an imaginary Paris.The musical choices are extremely bold.  This is a film that could have, ought to have, in fact, turned out as embarrassing and campy as the Peter Frampton/Bee Gee's disaster ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.""  It is a measure of the director's self-confidence that he dances so far out on a limb that the leaves tickle the ground, inviting disaster, but never falls from his perch.Nicole Kidman gives, I think, her best performance yet.  Ewan MacGregor is the complete leading man.  It's great to watch them together on screen. They are both real actors in an era when most are not.
I spent probably too much time worrying that the movie, like most, was going to fall apart before they managed to find their way to the end of the story. You needn't worry, when you watch it:  this movie works, like a charm. The crowd I saw it with tonight (opening weekend, LA) burst into applause at one point midway through the second act.  That NEVER happens in LA.  It was a deeply satisfied crowd that left the theater.  Don't believe the jaded reviewers who have lost to much of their imagination to take Luhrmann's wild ride:  go see it!",Moulin Rouge!
283,claudemercure,overrated but not bad,7,22 April 2005,"Favourable reaction to this movie is a good example of a common problem - audiences rewarding something because it's different, regardless of whether it's actually good.Luhrman has good intentions, but he sabotages his own movies by overloading the viewer's senses.The idea to make a period musical where the actors sing contemporary pop songs has great potential, but the storyline is incredibly simplistic, and Luhrmann seems completely incapable of dealing in genuine human emotions, which makes for a hollow movie-going experience.Still, there are a few inspired moments (the movie's high point is the 'Roxanne' number near the end, one of the only times the movie has any emotional power).",Moulin Rouge!
284,Jose E,"Not bad, to be a musical",6,24 November 2001,"Not being fond of either romantic films or musicals, I must say Moulin Rouge lived up to my expectations. Early in the movie I was a bit bored by too much light and dancing and the rest of elements of a musical but, fortunately, things improved before long. It was the first time I really paid attention to a Nicole Kidman's performance (Yes, it's true), and the same can be said for Ewan MacGregor, who I hardly knew something about, aside from his appearance in Star Wars.Though I have liked Moulin Rouge, my opinion on musicals hasn't changed.6/10.",Moulin Rouge!
285,jchano123,pretty colors doesn't equal good filmmaking,4,23 June 2017,"This was so distractingly cartoonish. It seemed to be flashy for the sake of being flashy.This has some of the absolute worst editing I have ever seen in a film. I nearly turned it off in the first 20 minutes because of how chaotic and choppy it was. It legitimately gave me nausea and I felt like I was having a seizure. The script was terrible. The dialogue has horrible and the story was formulaic. I know I say that a lot, but it is especially true for this if none else. For most of the run time, I was just sitting through it so I could watch cinemasins afterwards. I didn't even have to pay attention to it to know what was happening, that's how predictable it was.The songs did absolutely nothing for the story other than say what the audience already knew. They just felt like cheap time filler that went on forever. If the film is going to have such anachronistic music in it, why does it even bother telling us the year it takes place in? to have pretty costumes and sets? it seemed like it. Something so pretty really shouldn't feel so dull and empty.",Moulin Rouge!
286,RHPSvegas,A work of art bashed due to ignorance on the viewer's part,10,14 February 2002,"After carefully reading the previous comments I have come to theconclusion that the people who don't like this movie are one of twotypes: 1.They didn't understand it or 2.they are so self-absorbed withdiscrediting everything that they lack the ability to find the beauty insomething that truly exists therein. That's all I really have to say.Just because you don't like something, don't knock it. Also, this moviemust be seen in its 2.35:1 theatrical aspect ratio IN A THEATRE to fullydo the film justice. Maybe that's another reason some people don'tunderstand Moulin Rouge! - because what is presented on their TV screenis a) shrunken down b) does not fully show the great detail that wentinto this film. Even if its the widescreen version, can you honestlymake out the hats that go up at the end of Rhythm of the Night??? Doyourself a favor if you feel that you just can't stand this movie: sitthrough it just once without any distractions - I guarentee you'll findsomething you like.

287,JBLOSS,A shambles of great sets and terrible cliches,7,10 September 2001,This film looks great - it is visually superb but I  have to agree with many other viewers - some of the editing takes away from the dance scenes and everything tends to blur into a colourful mess. However sets aside the actual film is pretty weak - the singing is mediocre at best and the storyline is not exactly original. I didn't believe that there was this great love between Kidman and McGregor. Definitely one to see in the cinema but in terms of depth not much there.,Moulin Rouge!
288,myspecialparadise,It Only Had One Fault,9,17 August 2013,"It only had one fault ... advertising! I never saw any advertising for this movie, and I was living in Hollywood at the time! I saw the posters at Hollywood & Franklin ... but the posters gave no information what-so-ever, just some piece of artwork that really did not register in my brain! This is a movie I would have been thrilled to see at a theater.Nicole Kidman ... as much as a favorite as any of the classic actresses, such as Rita Hayworth, Ann-Margret, and, last but certainly not least ... Marilyn Monroe. As a matter of fact, I firmly believe that Nicole is Marilyn reincarnated ... all you have to do is look into those eyes and see Marilyn shining through! A very clever woman ... the part she plays is a little bit Ann-Margret, some Nicole, and a whole lot of Marilyn ... right down to her opening number and costume. You may find it interesting that her name in Happy Feet was Norma Jeane! Plus chosen by Chanel to be their Chanel Girl for a time! Nicole is also a Gemini, as was Marilyn. By the way, Marilyn's voice comes out quite clearly in the bomb ... ""Bewitched!"" I have not had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Kidman, but I sure hope that changes one day! The casting in this movie was Spectacular Spectacular and the movie has already become a Classic! By the way, I'm so surprised that John Leguizamo did not win an Oscar for his role in this film, as well as his role in ""To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"", this is one heck of an actor that should stand proudly next to another great actor ... Johnny Depp! I see them as equals! As a footnote ... I hated the number ""Like a Virgin!"" Without that number I would have given this a 10 star rating.",Moulin Rouge!
289,Bevan - #4,A stunning waste of opportunity,2,19 June 2001,"I was one of the many with a strong urge to walk out during the first ten minutes, but Tropical Storm Allison was outside the theater, so I stuck it out. The movie settled down thereafter, but never decided what it wanted to be. A contemporary Disney musical, done live action? A Pythonesque chaotic farce? A dark tragedy? A show piece for how good Nicole Kidman looks under colored filters? A ploy for Oscars for production values?Look, Python could have done its bits twice as well at a tenth the budget. In the meantime, while Obi-Wan sang credibly, I pay $8.50 a shot to see professional performers performing professionally - amateur hour we see for free on local cable - although poor Kidman was born 50 years too late to be the musical superstar she may have been. MacGregor sang as well as Travolta did in Grease, and that's all the praise he merits.(Meanwhile, did anyone notice that for all the money spent, not one thin dime went to anyone who could dance a lick? Vaudeville dancing WAS slightly more than flipping skirts to show skin while legs kicked spasmodically in random directions. Props to the director for the quick cuts to make it tough to notice how poorly executed the dancing was)Top 250 of all time? Bah. This movie was no better, in the end, than the bottom five movies I've paid to see. That list includes Moment By Moment, The Last Temptation of Christ, Plan Nine From Outer Space, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

Visually this film is beautiful (it must have costed hundreds of millions) but this movie is very flawed in almost every other aspect. It is VERY overacted. The characters were silly, some of them... actually grotesque. The story is cliched and completely predictable. I didn't watch it until the end, but since the beginning you'll already know the ending, trust me. So overall, this movie was boring and really ridiculous. This movie is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

After watching it, I thought it was a very unremarkable movie, maybe my expectations were too high. It just did not appeal to me as a musical or a drama. I actually have to consider the movie a fantasy movie to justify the relatively high rating that I gave it. The best thing about the movie was Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, they were great, especially when they were singing. But I found the movie really hard to watch overall, I found the fast paced music video style sequences in the movie terrible. The movie cost fifty-three million US$ to make, but it has only made an unremarkable fifty-eight million US$ in North America up until March 2002, this movie has really been over hyped. Moulin Rouge! is not for everyone, but some viewers sure loved it. More than 40% of the IMDb members that voted on this movie gave it a 10 out of 10. My rating is 7 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!

I admire musicals as they are just a joy to watch and moulin rouge delivers the best music of it times. All the songs are well crafted and performed,Nicole has performed close to 5 songs and so has even McGregor along with her for two songs. The Story as it claims is about freedom truth beauty and love(hope i got all four rite!) and yes it tries to capture them all together with Paris' very own Moulin Rouge in the background. The costume and stage set up is really awe inspiring and the make up for characters brings in the grandeur the director had in mind.

It blends a very sentimental, but touching story, familiar songs, and a 50s musical setting with a visual esthetic reminding that of video clips. The film is based essentially on the fact that the viewer already knows all the elements of it (we know from the first scene on how the story will end, the setting, characters, and occurring conflicts are familiar, as is the music). The film seems to aim to be the ""non plus ultra"" of film musical, it contains everything this genre - as well as other, related genres like video clips, revue movies, historic melodramas, and even animated Disney flicks (check out the green fairy scene or the singing moon!) - have to offer. It succeeds in this in an amazing way, due to the perfect screenplay, the good choice of music, the absolutely wonderful photography (has any actress ever seemed so beautiful on film as Nicole Kidman does here?!), and the stunning editing.

294,gus120970,"Freedom, Beauty, Truth, Love",10,3 April 2006,"The first time I saw Moulin Rouge was in that week of collective numbness following 9/11. We had made our way first to the Grosvenor Square US embassy to make a gesture of solidarity and its impromptu garden or remembrance and from thence to Odeon marble arch. The film itself astonished us - from its manic opening 10 minutes when we seemed witness to a star-studded, epic and monumental folly of film-making, to being, like Satine, swept from our firmly-planted critical feet and propelled along by its spectacular (spectacular) visual and intellectual ravishments. At that moment, leaving the theatre it seemed a joyous manifesto of what, decadent, dissolute, secular and unrooted as we are, we stand for in this world, which has true value, and what stands against us - cold, unforgiving and immune to the ideals of the 'Bohemian Revolution'. I have watched it many times since, its fascination unfading like that of the Wizard of Oz, as it is almost a version of that film for adults, but instead of a monochrome ending we are plunged into the deepest black - which in all truth we know awaits us all in any case. Wizard of Oz is equally applicable to its director, as it is a directorial feat that transforms it, alchemically, from lead to gold. Without the boldest and most extreme editing, and a tongue continually planted in its cheek most of the dialogue sections between the setpieces would have ruined the film, even accounting for some stellar performances from the principles. Instead they are played melodramatically yet sincerely, and it works, allowing the story to flow between the sensual, comedic and tragic delights expressed for the most part in song and dance.",Moulin Rouge!

The story is predictable and cliched. The dialogue almost unbearable after the first five seconds when one realises that song lyrics are to make up the bulk of the 'profundity'. The acting is adequate, the singing and dancing are impressively staged but this film is almost unbearable to sit through and holds no interest or surprises. It reminds me of a lavish Rock Eistedfodd. My vote 6/10 (only because of the lead actors and musical numbers).",Moulin Rouge!

The people who live in the apartment upstairs from him call him and help get to talk to Harold (Jim Broadbent) to turn this script into a play. The story takes longer than that so Ewan finds Satine and falls in love with her. Then then films gets even more interesting. With singing performances and acting up to great standards you may not notice the great sets provided for the film's setting. They are fabulous and everything runs smoothly to provide a great movie.*****",Moulin Rouge!
297,Asa_Nisi_Masa2,Mixed cheese platter anyone?,1,2 May 2005,"I'd rather enjoyed Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, I'd been overwhelmed by the gaudiness of Strictly Ballroom but somehow also managed to find some mindless entertainment in that... but I am sorry to say I won't be anywhere near as generous with Moulin Rouge. Some adoring reviewers here have claimed this film has revealed the endless possibilities of cinema to them. I must then think that they haven't seen very many films in their lives, seeing as Moulin Rouge does nothing but pick 'n mix then regurgitate with an extra helping of gorgonzola from films and genres that have been seen, digested and assimilated many, many times before. Except the now-obligatory post-modern irony isn't even in this mish-mash, as the two leads - Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in particular - are so totally devoid of any ability to do irony, you'll end up with tooth decay at the end of this schmaltzy ride. Kidman and her button nose, which prevents her from looking anything but pretty but never beautiful (as this film would have us believe), is probably one of the most actory actresses working in Hollywood today. Her performances go through all the motions - see her Oscar-winning performance in The Hours, for instance, where she showed us what a mentally disturbed, brooding artist does, at least externally - without ever reaching anything resembling the SOUL of her character. In this sense, when comparing Julianne Moore's unforgettable performance to Kidman's in the same film, you understand in what ways she could also be viewed as unconvincing as the doomed courtesan Satine in Moulin Rouge. As for McGregor, who was supposed to be playing a young Londoner (with an awfully good Scottish accent for someone from so far South in the UK!), his Christian had a little more integrity, but way too much sap. Watching such a man declare his undying love to me would probably make me feel like the most unromantic, irreverent and callous woman in matters of love! The film itself, essentially an old-fashioned musical with no original songs and a few clever gimmicks to give it a superficial modern veneer, will probably date very quickly. Whoever will be watching it in, say, the year 2020 won't help noticing how turn-of-the-century it is. A film which uses popular culture references for a greater, more timeless purpose rather than being used BY them, will probably stand the test of time. Not so a film which does nothing but wink and nudge the spectator all the way through just to show how up-to-date with all the latest, late 90s, trendy pop references such as MTV-style cinematography, Bollywood movie aesthetics, Kylie Minogue and the ""naughty"" and Bohemian use of absinthe (which had a revival in the late 90s)... Even the big, turn-of-the-century New Year's bash... a direct reference to the MTV generation's own 1999. **SPOILERS AHEAD** One scene I found particularly ridiculous was the one in which the ruddy-cheeked, mustachioed Cockney (in Paris!) impresario Jim Broadbent (only superficially reprising his much more interesting role from Topsy Turvy), tells Nicole's Satine she's dying of consumption (tuberculosis for you and I). He does this as a last resort to convince her once and for all that she must give up her true love, the impoverished writer Christian and sleep with the evil Duke so that he'll sponsor the Moulin Rouge and her acting career. When Satine hears this shocking bit of news about her health, she reluctantly agrees to going along with her impresario's wish. I'll explain why I think this scene is ridiculous: if anyone has ever known someone who's had to go through the unspeakable pain of discovering they have a terminal illness, they will know that Satine's reaction - agreeing to give up her love for Christian - is psychologically the least credible thing she could have done. Exactly because she knew she had so little to live, what really matters most in life would suddenly have come into sharp focus for her. She'd have wanted to spend her last period alive doing exactly what she had always wished for and what was really worthwhile - not pretending to love someone she despised in order to further someone else's business interests! As for her own business interests, what would they matter if she knew she was dying? **END OF SPOILERS** Speaking of the Duke and the way the evil, upper-class patron was portrayed in Moulin Rouge - he made the whole film so similar to Titanic in my eyes. Not unlike that other gargantuan cheese-platter, Moulin Rouge's poor were the generous, creative, lively, warm, vibrant salt-of-the-earth types to its cold, heartless, snobbish, evil rich. Moulin Rouge and Titanic portray class differences in a manner so simplistic, I wonder why more people didn't feel insulted by such an affront to their intelligence.Other majorly irritating elements about Moulin Rouge besides the... er... choice of music were some of the supporting characters, John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec in the front row. A lisping, simpering fool played by an actor of average stature unconvincingly walking on his knees.... It makes one balk just to think he was meant to portray one of France's legendary Belle Epoque artists, one whose artistic heritage embodies that time in the French capital like few others. Yet here he was, reduced to no more than a cutesy, Disney animal side-kick so he could be fed to the MTV generation without turning them off from the historic/cultural baggage that would come with such a figure normally! My final words on Moulin Rouge are that if I'm going to watch a gaudy, noisy song-and-dance with funny characters talking in silly voices, give me the original Muppet Show series any day.",Moulin Rouge!
298,binaryg,Kidman and Luhrmann and Incredible,10,2 June 2001,"Not often enough, a film is released that I have to see because I know I must. The last one for me was Titus and the one before was Thin Red Line. These are love it or hate it films. Moulin Rouge had me from the moment it started to the very end of the credits. It promised and delivered audacity. I've read the critics who've written Moulin Rouge is visually spectacular but the story line is weak. The story tells us that love is the most important thing a human can experience. Only those who have never fallen in Love can doubt that. I am on the wrong side of a romantic involvement, but Moulin Rouge reminded me of the power of Love. As for the actors: Nicole Kidman is Incredible and gorgeous(I can only feel sorry for Tom). She sings so well and her face is incredible to look at. Ewan McGregor (who's he?) sings incredibly. Jim Broadbent's characterization and singing are mesmerizing and Leguizamo is a comic, lisping Toulouse-Lautrec. The weaving of movie and MTV music is incredible. (Is that really what Roxanne is about?)Thank you Baz Luhrmann",Moulin Rouge!
299,ShinKyo81,"""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return""",10,21 December 2001,"When I saw the ""Moulin Rouge!"" trailer, I became sceptic with the film. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman teased the audience, two brilliant actors in a musical could be interesting. But when I knew the person behind all the production was Baz Luhrmann (""Romeo+Juliet""), I thought it would be a strange, surrealistic film, like his other movies.I became more interested with the film when I heard that the music in ""Moulin Rouge!"" was including many greatest modern hits from U2, Nirvana, Elton John... That really surprised me, never expecting this twist in the film: ""Smell Like Teen Spirits"" or ""All You Need Is Love"" in the beginnings of the 20th century? It was sure a worth look.Finally, I saw the movie. And I must admit that ""Moulin Rouge!"" has reached deep inside on me. It has captivated the audience with its strength, its colourful shots, its ""fairy tale"" atmosphere, returning to the classical musical films, but with a cool modern look.Some people would say ""Moulin Rouge!"" lacks in plot. Just think for a moment: since when do musical movies emphasize in the story? Like ""West Side Story"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"", the most important thing is the music! Ewan McGregor plays the role of Christian, who falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman), the most beautiful girl on the Moulin Rouge, in Paris. It will start a relationship full of obstacles, which will end tragically...I think that the important points of the film are the rythm of the movie and the music. From the end until the beginning you won't be able to get out of the film. It will absorb you until the end. And in order to catch all the details, you should buy or rent it when it hits the stores, because in the cinema you will be overwhelmed by its greatness.One thing that really reached me is the beautiful message that delivers the film to the watcher: ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return"". That's what all the people should keep in mind.Anyway, ""Moulin Rouge!"" is really a worth look. Charming, outstanding, fascinating and brilliant. What can I say more? The soundtrack is great and the DVD too! Really really a worth look! 10/10",Moulin Rouge!
300,Dia Klain,Worth dancing over,9,26 August 2001,"SPOILER ALERT Moulin Rouge; where the old and rich go to dance with the young and the beautiful. Well, perhaps, not all so very young, and not all beautiful, but wild looking in any case. That, which starts with the drawing of the red curtain, soon turns into a swirl of skirts and colored doll faces as Christian enters that wild sacred realm. At first the unsuspecting audience is sure to feel much of the same confusion as the poetical hero. Peeping colored faces poking out of a hole in the ceiling; sexy green fairies; clowns; a hyperactive short guy; a hyperactive tall mean guy; a hyperactive pimp stile boss; some hyperactive swirls of skirt. Hyperactive faces; hyperactive redhead making love to a blanket; hyperrrr r  r And just when one thought the movie would swirl away into oblivion till the end all slows down and tis time for a love song, and then another, and then the story is on. Does the hyperactiveness return, by all means, but by that time one is ready for it and does not feel like they are hit on the head continually with a diamond covered gold bat. Now We break it down.Story- is very unoriginal, the most unoriginal element about all of this movie, in fact. (possible spoiler) Boy meets girl, boy and girl from different ends of the meat rack of life, boy loves girl, girl loves boy, another boy loves girl who is from her side of the meat rack, girl chooses love boy number 1, something happens to make girl choose the other nasty bad boy but does not tell our hero why she does. Girl inevitably chooses hero boy and they live happily ever after, ups... Well, no, actually this is the other variation where the girl dies and the boy lives on to tell about it (think Titanic). Obviously, the movie is a love story plain and simple like many others, so what is special about this one? Filming/art- is absolutely exquisite. The hyperactiveness defiantly works to catch one's attention even if one hates it all along they are sure to be windswept by it. Wonderful effects such as the black and whitish beginning that all of a sudden gains color. The life is like oxygen speech comes on and Ups! Confused face on Christian, guy drops though roof, it turns into a comedy of sorts! All this being very very well filmed the whole wile. Alright, so, when it does slow down by the end, say, after the tango scene, (SPOILER) one starts to think to oneself, alright, die already. Let me just tell you, Satine does not die until it is obvious she is going to, so do not fight! But, enough of that. Music: is very very nicely put together. Moulin Rouge seems to capture within itself all the popular music of the 20th century and mixes it up within each other to present it in a surprisingly tasteful blend. Some songs are especially amusing to listen to for they surely parody the original (ahm, Like a Virgin). Verdict? Even though the plot is not original, the love plot never is. Simply put, this movie did all it possibly could have out of a very obvious plot line, both where acting was concerned, artistically, and in filming, they even mixed in a little comedy which was a big surprise to myself. If you like colorful swirling movies, watch it, If you are a very old couple walking on stilts between mortality and death and get a heart attack at the drop of a hat (or the throw of a hat) stay away from this one and continue with the every day Days Of Our Lives.",Moulin Rouge!

WHAT? did the camera movements affect your opinion of the film THAT much? this is a perfect story, with beautiful cinematography, gorgeous sets and costumes! what more do you want? I admit, i took half a point off for the camera movements and the first quarter of the movie being on SPEED, but that's it. the other half a point came from 'roxanne'. that is just a terrifying song/sequence i still have to change the channel for because i can't handle it, but that's it.

302,diztorted,How wonderful life is...,10,2 June 2001,"...Now that Mouline Rouge is in the world. First of all, I'd like to apologize to Baz Luhrmann the director, to Nicole Kidman and to Ewan MacGregor, because no matter how hard I'd try to express how wonderful this film is and all the things it made feel, it won't be enough. This film is a total experience of life. I still have in my head all the color, the music, the wonder, the sadness, but most of all...I still feel the love. Mouline Rouge is fierce, is catastrophic, but also magnificent and exhilarating. In every single frame you will find the lust, grandeur and love of the time, but those sensations are as timeless as humanity and so is music, and this is what we experience here. You will doubt your senses, you won't believe your eyes, nor your ears. It will make your skin crawl in every single scene, and when you least expect it, your mouth will be opened wide, your eyes won't be able to blink and your ears will be fed with the most beautiful feast of music you'll ever find in a movie (except Dancer in the Dark). A love story told in a very unique way, like no other in the whole world. The dreamer who believed in love not withstanding he never felt it before; the delicate but beautiful courtesan who moved and felt like real Satin; the evil Duke (Maharajah) who would do everything he could to get the girl; and after all, the place that made all that possible...The Mouline Rouge, a place for dreams, lust, glamour, music, love, and LIFE. A fascinating place, colorful and hyperactive in which a visit was like a taste of Absinthe, well, the whole film is.Now, I'd also like to thank Baz Luhrmann, for bringing this visual feast to life, for giving us a piece of art that reminds us once again what is what we really love from cinema, and a film that will remain in my head forever. To Nicole Kidman for being such an extraordinary person, who like Satin, awakens all my senses just by looking at her. And finally Ewan MacGregor, who is an actor who's always surprising me in everything he does, I don't remember anything I didn't like from him. Overall, a film that is here to stay, so cry, weep, sing, love, and live it....Go visit the Mouline Rouge.Ahhh, after you see this film, you will hate Tom Cruise (even more) for leaving such a person like Nicole.",Moulin Rouge!
303,nbott,A Triumph of Style over Substance,5,22 January 2002,"This is a film which epitomizes what is wrong with so many movies today. Let's dazzle them with rapid film images, scrupulously designed cinematography and loud music. This film, once you get over the excitement of these features, leaves you with nothing to think about or be emotionally moved by. The story is nothing but a rehash of the classic melodramatic story plot of most 1930s' musicals. Fortunately, in those musicals, we had memorable and creative music. This film's music is one big disaster and the story is basically idiotic. The most embarrassing moments in the film are the ones in which Nicole Kidman sings. Her attempt to be Marilyn Monroe in her opening number is the worst piece of film music I have ever had to sit through. Even the poor singing Ewan McGregor is not as annoying. The relative lack of musical imagination in this film is staggering. Except for two moderately original song and dance numbers, this film is a musical nightmare.I can not really understand the hype regarding this film. It is mediocre and ultimately unsatisfying.",Moulin Rouge!

This movie was a wild ride.  The energy and the passion were incredible.  This film was an explosion, a bright shining beacon of filmmaking to movie studios everywhere.I could just imagine the pitch:  Doomed lovers meet in a dance hall/brothel in 1900 Paris.  Oh, and it's a musical, with the actors singing modern songs.  Yet somehow, studio execs took a chance on this, and bless them for it.Regardless of what anyone thinks of this film, what cannot be denied is the aggressive, infectious energy of it.  It pulls you in so hard and so fast your neck is nearly broken, not to mention the rapid transitions which make you throw all sense and reason out the window.  But that's the point:  in the bohemian world of the Moulin Rouge, sense and reason have no place here, only truth, beauty, freedom, and love.As I watched it, I saw a distinct similarity between it and Asian action films.  Both have incredible energy thrown into their ""action"" sequences, with wild, improbable, breakneck transitions that challenge the viewer to follow, especially when the performers pitch ""Spectacular Spectacular"" to the Duke.There were only two flaws that I saw.  A personal dislike of mine is being shown the ending and then the rest of the film is shown in flashback.  I hate knowing the ending before it occurs, and this film commits that sin.The second was the drop in energy.  The first hour is one musical number after another, and then in the second it drops off to tell the story.  I know that had to happen sooner or later, but after being exposed to the incredible energy of the first hour, it was a bit of a letdown.But this is still an incredible film, something that lives up to its hype.",Moulin Rouge!
305,LT-10,"Words can't describe it; a (Yes, I'm going to say the ""M"" word) MASTERPIECE!",10,25 December 2001,"I'm in awe...............what a movie! Ewan McGregor put it perfectly on the DVD: this movie is a FEAST! Where to begin? It pulls you in, it does not let you go and I loved every minute of it. The film's opening song(Nature Boy) becomes more and more haunting every time I hear it. We move through Turn of the century Paris, but this isn't the upper class were used to. No, we are seeing the other side, the ""poor"" side of Paris. However, it is so much more beautiful to see.
It is impossible to pick a favorite scene. There are no stops, and you don't want it to stop. It is the musical I always dreamed of, the musical in your head where none, not-even-the slow ones are boring. It is all enthralling and you can't look away, it is too beautiful. El Tango Roxanne, I remember being blown away when I saw this number in the theater. It is breathtaking! THE ENTIRE FILM IS BREATHTAKING!!! WHAT AN ACHIEVEMENT! WHAT A RIDE! A MASTERPIECE! YES! YES!

Unfortunately I found out it was a loud mess of a movie, edited to within an inch of its life.Apparently this is 'reinventing the musical'.  Well yes, if by reinvention you mean 'no melodies' and 'snatches of pop song lyrics thrown around like confetti'.Some would argue the film is refreshing, and in some ways it is because the cast and director are plainly doing whatever they think is fun, but I found it to be like a four year old with a toy: it's fun for him but bloody annoying for you because he's so loud.This is a bloody mess of a movie, and I'm usually very open-minded.",Moulin Rouge!

However, there the visual pyrotechnics had been at the disposal of the greatest love story ever told; the plot here is, well, NOT the greatest love story ever told.  The whole things starts off too silly to take seriously, Satine falls for Christian merely because the script requires it (who wouldn't fall in love with Nicole Kidman?), and the fact the story is being told in flashback destroys all tension as to what will happen.  McGregor and Kidman are fine both as actors and singers, but the words spewing out of their mouths are such a bewildering purree of pop culture references the mind can't process everything.   I recommend the film for Luhrman's dazzling visuals and the fine work by the actors (particularly Jim Broadbent, who should get an Oscar nomination), but the writing keeps it from being as good as it could have been.

For the first time was like getting hit by a Mac truck then taking a roller coaster ride afterwards. This film is unique and like no other I have ever seen before (gilbert and Sullivan come close in the PP). There is so much eye/ear candy in this movie  that I did not have time to absorb or enjoy it all. The last time I saw this much energy in a music/movie was ""Stop Making Sense"" (1984) you stare in disbelief at the wattage expended. The second time I watched   Moulin Rouge! I enjoyed it. I have mixed feelings about most of the dialogue coming from other song lyrics. I watch older films and listen to older music and enjoyed picking out several lines from these films and songs.  Since many young movie goers may not realize this, it will pass over their heads unnoticed. Such reuse is not a new concept and is enjoyable if done well, camp if forced. When the reuse was well-integrated, it was magical but there is a couple of  gear grinding moments (""Like a Virgin"" needs work). Over all, 96% of the music was well integrated and awesome. The cinematography, costumes and choreography make this a visually stunning event. With uncommon movies like Moulin Rouge! that can't be easily categorized, people will either love or hate this movie. I fall into the love faction. The plot is simple and fanciful but who quotes ""War and Peace"" on a roller coaster? In defense the plot does have an ending not typical of the sappy ""happy ending"" one expects.",Moulin Rouge!
317,kickstand,The whole is less than the sum of its parts,7,4 June 2001,"Well, if you ever doubted the auteur theory, you should check out""Moulin Rouge"". This film is definitely the product of someone'sspecific imagination, not a film made by Hollywood committee.
The first half of Moulin Rouge is very nearly a great film, with somesequences that truly astonish. In particular, the number which setsup the play-within-the-movie, and the stunningly funny number byJim Broadbent are dazzling.However, after the Broadbent number the film simply runs out ofsteam as it creeps toward its glaringly obvious conclusion. A lot ofthe 2nd half could have been cut out without anyone missinganything. I think the problem is that the film's wafer-thin plot is notnoticed during the dazzling first half, but becomes just annoyingenough as the film continues.Still, this film is a must-see if you fall into any of the followingcategories: --film buff --musicals buff --""Strictly Ballroom"" buff --French history ca 1900 buffMy rating: 8/10",Moulin Rouge!

I came into Moulin Rouge with mixed expectations, and got the viewpoints of someone who loved it, and someone who hated it. I liked the film overall but there are some issues that I have with it that I won't spoil. The film is over the top, which for some can be jarring, especially with the editing and musical numbers. It does give the film a certain energy, but it gets old really quick. The plot is also put forth to us fairly quick, especially for a film that is 2 hours. The singing is eh, but my favorite sequence in the film uses ""Roxanne"" as a tango, and it is shot, choreographed, and sung well. I also enjoyed the set design and costumes, but the editing sometimes prevents me from looking at it. As a whole, I'd give Moulun Rouge a rental. I liked it, but I wish I could love it. However, I can say that is is infinitely better than Titanic.",Moulin Rouge!
320,MundaneNoodle,Some original music would be nice.,7,8 August 2001,"I guess Baz Luhrmann assumes that the majority of movie-goers won't appreciate a revival of the cinematic musical unless it is filled to the gills with melodies and lyrics that we are already familiar with. Original compositions are a good thing! Really, they are! Practically every other film has more original music on the soundtrack than this movie. It's also history mangling, how am I supposed to suspend my disbelief that this is Paris in 1899, when I keep hearing music from the 70's and 80's? Don't get me wrong, the arrangements were written and performed faithful to the spirit of the Broadway musical. At least they got that part right. Well maybe I shouldn't take the whole thing too seriously, but I WAS hoping for a somewhat more original story too. *spoiler* Ok so Nicole starts coughing up blood, gee what's going to happen at the end? Two people from different classes fall in love but it is ultimately doomed? *yawn* A writer changes the play to reflect his own affairs...gosh that's never happened before. Is it all bad? No, it's beautifully  filmed, with rich, exquisite colors. I laughed a few times, especially when the duke stomps on the frog in an effort to impress Satine. Leguizamo is also an unexpected treat. Unless you are a fan of the musical, don't bother with this one. If you ARE a fan, then you probably have already seen it. If not, just be prepared that you might be disappointed.",Moulin Rouge!

But that whole sappy love story was beyond pathetic.  I just don't understand how anyone can think this film compares to great musicals or great films.  Rocky Horror Picture Show blows this movie away in terms of plot, music, choreography and characters... and its not like Rocky Horror is that great.  moulin rouge is sentimental blither. the original music was god-awful.  a few of the remakes were done in a fun sort of way, but nothing too outstanding.  this was as bad as ""chocolat"" but more annoying with all the obnoxious camera movements and other trickery.  2 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!
322,kayabay,Best musical since The Sound Of Music,10,12 January 2002,"Moulin Rouge is perhaps the best musical since The Sound Of Music. Not in the same league, but not in the same league with any other musicals either. The idea of using the best love songs of all time to form a musical seems inconvenient, but it really works out. Nicole Kidman's performance is superb is as her astounding voice & fragile esthetic physical appearence. She'll be one of the Academy Award nominees without a doubt. Ewan McGregor is the weakest link but Jim Broadbent must be another Academy nominee with his ecstatic performance at his age. Baz Luhrmann made an effort to create a masterpiece and he's done it. I hope the Academy gives this effort what it deserves.",Moulin Rouge!

I couldn't finish this.,2,24 November 2010,"I mean I physically could not finish because the lightning fast editing was hurting my eyes and just making me dizzy. The camera switches scenes on average about every 1-2 seconds and I've got the beginnings of a headache to prove it. Never have I had a movie make me physically sick, but this one has managed to achieve that distinction and not just because of the editing.I can't say what the story is actually about because I couldn't discern that amidst the cluster of technicolor overload, ridiculously hyperbolic characters, and MTV music videos cinematography. Luhrmann tries too hard to be out of the box and winds up with a total mess here.I gave it 1 star for the effort and another star for the production. The costumes and staging are wonderful. At least I think they are. The camera moves so fast I'm not sure I actually saw what I saw. Suffice it to say I won't be going anywhere near this film EVER.",Moulin Rouge!

Luhrman has been climbing his way up the musical ladder with Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet, and has succeeded admirably in this grand romantic epic.",Moulin Rouge!
326,thechosen1,Every single person involved in this movie should have had an Oscar nomination.,10,12 December 2002,"This movie is a classic.  So vibrant, so spectacular, so captivating.  It had every single quality of a great musical.  Not a single song was out of place.  Just by looking at the elaborate sets and costumes, you could tell that a huge amount of effort and passion was put into this.  The story is very ordinary, but the way that Baz Luhrmann has presented it is simply delightful. And the singing... oh dear Lord, Ewan and Nicole's voices!  They were so good!  It didn't look as if they were doing this for the first time (although Ewan did sing in A Life Less Ordinary - but that was just one song), it looked like they had been singing for ages!  By the way, I loved how they turned ""Roxanne"" into a tango.  Ok, now for the acting.  I was so surprised that Ewan McGregor didn't get any nomination for Best Actor at the Oscars.  He was just great, superb, amazing, excellent.  Not just his singing (and his oh-so-attractive appearance) but his expressions.  You could almost feel every emotion Christian (his character) was feeling, it reflected so clearly on his face while he was singing AND acting.  This guy is a very, very good actor and now we all know he can sing as well!  Nicole Kidman was very impressive and she has also proven that she has a beautiful singing voice as well.  Her performance was brilliant as well and I was glad that she got a nomination.  She looked great too.  She portrayed every aspect of Satine (her character) very genuinely. 
Now anyone who's seen Richard Roxburgh before could almost laugh when they see him in the Duke's role.  He had to change his voice and normal facial appearance and the way that he carried himself was so much suited to the character, that sometimes you didn't even realise that this was Richard. Excellent performance, I loved it.Jim Broadbent is so good at every role that he does.  Even though he got an Oscar for Iris this year, his performance in this movie was great too.  It was a very difficult role, but he played it to perfection. 
I've always been a fan of John Leguizamo's work.  His character was a very difficult one too and he didn't disappoint me at all this time either.  The accent along with the humourous personality of Toulouse Lautrec was nicely done.  There was only one big disappointment and that was that Baz Luhrmann did not get nominated for an Academy Award.  Now that was simply not fair.  This certainly wasn't a movie to be overlooked.  Even if they intentionally did not nominate him, there was no reason for it.  That spectacular, visually stunning piece of work definitely could not have been achieved without him. He's got such an imaginative and artistic outlook on various aspects of life and he really makes very interesting and entertaining films to say the least.  One of the best musicals of all time, definitely.  *****/***** Watch it.",Moulin Rouge!
327,Elgroovio,Rubbish,1,19 May 2004,"This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. The acting is just plain embarrassing, the singing will make you scream as though you were having a nail hammered into your ear. There is one thing in this film which makes it even worse and that is Nicole Kidman. She drives me nuts what with all her popularity. Her singing drives me mad; better sounds have come from buttocks than from her mouth. And the worst thing is, out of every three films that come out in the cinema, one is almost certain to have Kidman in it. Anyway back to the film, it contains a very nice song called ""Nature Boy"", of which a very nice version was made a long time ago by Nat ""King"" Cole, but in the film, they have a version of it which is so bad that when I saw the film I had to make a desperate struggle to avoid myself from bursting into tears of pity for Nat ""King"" Cole and all the other good artists who recorded the song. So if you've just swallowed a deadly poison, come and see this film, and the poison and everything else that's in your stomach will surely go back the way it came.

328,zhixiong,Great movie to add to your DVD collection,10,28 January 2005,"When I first picked up this DVD, I was skeptical about watching a musical movie. I thought I will fall asleep but I was wrong.Moulin Rouge! is a very colourful movie with beautiful costumes and great songs. The only original song was ""Come What May"", which was originally composed for Romeo + Juilet. Ewan McGregor sang very well in ""Your Song"". I have to say I like his style better than Elton John's original version.I read some of the comments in IMDb and there are extremely negative as well as extremely positive comments. You guys have to understand that Baz Luhrmann and Quentin Tarantino belong to the same league. They produce unique movies that are different from the rest. You either hate it or love it.

329,chadlund,An interesting hit clip,7,20 January 2017,"Christian, a young bohemian poet, arrives in Paris with no means. He falls in love with Satin, a captivating lead dancer at the Moulin Rouge. The young woman is not insensitive to the young man, but she is not indifferent either to the Duke, a boisterous extremely-rich bourgeois, who could provide for her future indefinitely. The two men's favors fall short at the end of the movie, where Satin dies on stage of pneumonia. If the intrigue is platitudinous, the romance flat and no languish, the characters have no depth - the realization of this piece is quite admirable as it delivers the apotheosis of the esthetic video-clip, minced and glittering. Despite being outrageously tacky, it's a successful musical and the criticism should be softened.",Moulin Rouge!

The plot in this movie is nothing new or to get excited over, it's just a retelling of a common tale of romance.  The use of modern songs in the past might be what critics were so excited over, but these same critics condemned ""A Knights Tale"" for using a similar tactic, in the same year I might add.  This movie was so boring my wife refused to watch it after the first 10 minutes, and it took me all 5 days of my rental to get through it.  My friend also went through the same ritual, only this time he walked and his wife forced her way through it.",Moulin Rouge!
332,OldRose,McGregor's Best; Kidman's Breakthrough; together FANTASTIC!,10,9 December 2001,"For the first time in Calendar Year 2001, I walked out of a film and thought that maybe, just maybe, I had just seen 'Best Picture'...!With an opener like that where do I begin?  As noted with ""A Knight's Tale"", we have a revisionist approach to a musical in order to animate an audience where period music would not, and yet this in and of itself, while an ingenious idea, cannot guarantee success. Except that in both the mentioned films, it worked... and fabulously so!Nicole Kidman went ignored after a hugely successful performance in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a film that would prove quasi-prophetic in at least one sense although few would know at the time. It seemed in fact that neither performance with husband Tom Cruise (Far and Away, 1992) would earn either member of the now severing couple the praise they deserved. Kidman of course came out the bigger loser, having starred in the interim opposite many a big name and with very little notice. This has now changed!  Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, far newer but improving rapidly, just slides right into this role as if he were born for it. They both do, and it may be the springboard both needed: story, art direction, music, sets, costumes, make-up, direction, and yes acting, not to mention the singing (!!!) will have this film well up on the awards platter at serving time. In addition to our two leads, outstanding supporting performances from John Leguizamo and Richard Roxburgh are thrilling, and this is one film where the entire cast could garner the Screen Actor's Guild award for Cast & Company as everyone involved in the unfolding of the story played a critical role, no matter how great or small. Add Best Soundtrack and possibly Best Song to the honours list and then you have it. A true masterpiece! To director Baz Luhrmann and fellow script co-writer Craig Pearce, ""Chapeau""!

333,Apollo-14,Entertain us!,5,12 June 2001,"One scene in this movie sums up the entire experience of ""Moulin Rouge"": The gleeful throng gathered at the Moulin Rouge/nightclub dances frenetically to a techno beat and breaks out into a chorus from Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", ""Here we are now/Entertain us.""  Kurt Cobain had something like this in mind when he wrote that song.  Today's audiences would flock to see any piece of crap that is promoted.  Not only that, they will eat it up and call it ice cream.I'm not sure if Baz Luhrman made this movie deliberately to raise this rather intriguing issue or if this is simply the worst movie ever made.  At times it feels as if he's poking fun at the indulgent, extravagant excess that is today's pop culture or if he is a part of it.  Maybe it's both.  I found this ambiguity interesting and watched the entire movie, even though half the audience walked out during the first twenty minutes.

336,screamer-13,Brilliant but flawed,8,20 September 2001,"Moulin Rouge is an amazing film, you cannot deny it that. I cannot praise it highly enough. The musical numbers are a work of genius, and show excellence in every single aspect of film-making, and some aspects you didn't even know existed. It shows touches of brilliance in places where other films don't even have places. The acting is superb and because the acting is superb the casting is superb. The singing is wonderful too. The duets between Nicole and Ewan are delightful, and the no-holds-barred in-your-face song and dance routines are breathtaking. Musically, there is genius stamped all over this film - where else are you going to find Lady Marmalade blended perfectly with Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit; Madonna's Like A Virgin re-worked into a mini-operetta; or a love serenade that glides seamlessly from The Beatles to Whitney Houston without seeming out of place? And at the heart of it all, a tragic love story so simple and pure that it could have flowed from the pen of Shakespeare or been scrawled by the stylus of Homer.And yet, this high-concept simplicity of the story proves to be the downfall of the film. With no other concepts on the menu other than Ewan's undying love for Nicole, and her predicament, the film is doomed from the onset - it has nowhere to go but towards its final destination, and nothing to do but repeat itself until it gets there. There are several key lines and song lyrics in the film which will stick in your head at the end; but were you astute enough to notice that the only reason they stuck is because you heard them six times each? It's as though the writers had a photocopying problem and ended up with a rogue page of dialogue repeatedly popping up elsewhere in the script. Either that or Baz Luhrmann is unaccustomed to the phrase ""flogging a dead horse"". That major plot simplicity gripe aside, the only other thing that irked me was the cinematography - a lot of the time images looked as though they had very little depth of field and poor reproduction of dark colours, almost as if they had been shot on a poor-quality DV camera. Maybe this was intentional and maybe not, but either way it did the film no favours. Having said which, all the colours and digitally-enhanced bits were vibrant, and you can forget any stunning landscape or sunset shots you may have seen in your life, because the close-ups of Nicole's face have redefined the meaning of beautiful cinematography - at least in my humble opinion :)Anyway, as you can probably tell by my words, Moulin Rouge is a two-faced demon of a film - at its best, inspired, uplifting, and beautiful; and at its worst, repetitive, clichéd, and overly simplistic.I'm sure it will be remembered forever for its daring originality in bringing a forgotten genre back to life, but whether it deserves a place in our memories as one of the all-time great films... is highly debatable to say the least.",Moulin Rouge!
337,mmunies,"Silly, campy fun that could have been a lot better",6,8 June 2001,"Well, I definitely didn't hate Moulin Rouge like I feared but there were times I felt like hiding my head with a blanket. In all honesty, if you get through the first 15 or so minutes and see what they are doing, you find yourself getting into this rather silly but still fun flick.I had a few complaints though - the frenetic camera movement (particularly in the beginning scenes), the really absurd added touches such as a fake moon smiling and others, and the inability to slow down to see the characters create the story rather than have to narrate what is going on. 
This is absolutely not a film for everyone.  I can see where the novelty of the film is a real positive and the special effects were amazing. Sure, the story has been done a billion times but it's a good story if a little saccharine.  I don't mind mush as long as it's honest mush - this film struck me as being honest mush.I liked the acting overall but this is the sort of film that didn't really call for heavy acting from the leads which was a little disappointing.  Jim Broadbent has been one of my favorites for a while and I thought he did a great job.  I've always found myself impartial to Ewan McGregor and I just enjoy watching him on screen period.  I thought both he and Nicole Kidman had ""okay"" voices but I think if you took away some of the echoing and effects, they would have sounded a bit flat.   It almost looked like Kidman was lip-synching in a few scenes which I'm sure she was. 
I give it an ""A"" for effort and I loved the originality - parts of the film were quite memorable and good.  But it just wasn't enough to sustain an entire film and it sort of missed it with the frenetic editing, the over simplified story, and too silly, cringeable touches.",Moulin Rouge!
338,Movies8586,I think I'm in love...,10,19 February 2002,"...with MOULIN ROUGE! I'll start by making a bold statement: this is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen! Everything about this movie is superb: acting, direction, style, music, etc.!Baz Luhrmann has really outdone himself this time! With this movie, he shows what you REALLY can do a movie camera. He's not like most other directors: he's original and interesting.Nicole Kidman gives one of the most dynamic performances of the year as 'Satine', a dazzling and mysterious courtesan/nightclub performer! Not only does she display a full range of emotions, but she also unleashes a glorious singing voice! Who knew she was a singer??!!Ewan McGregor is just as wonderful as Christian, a struggling young writer who falls in love with Satine. McGregor is a great actor and can do just about anything! He also sings very well... and does a fine job with the Elton John classic, 'Your Song'.John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent also shine in supporting roles.If you have seen this movie, and liked it, then please purchase the soundtrack! Kidman and McGregor's soaring rendition of 'Come What May' and the Christina Aguilera/Pink/Mya/Li'l Kim pop hit 'Lady Marmalade' are entertaining highlights!If you have NOT seen this movie (for some strange reason...), I strongly suggest that you do.

Kidman as Satine, the star in the Moulin Rouge sing in the beginning an old but very famous Marilyn Monroe Song ""Diamonds are Girls best friend"" who had also a return in Madonnas ""Material Girl"" in the 80ties. The film mixed it in one moment. But Kidman sing a cooler version as Monroe and more sophisticated as Madonna. When she sing ""Heroes"" together with her lover the make it better than David Bowie himself, because when she sing ""I drink all the time you"" she drinks not like Bowie ""the time"" -she drinks tea all the time.

342,kmberger,This film will simply dazzle you.,10,10 June 2002,"Forget everything you thought you knew about the Hollywood musical.  Forget anyone who ever said that the musical was dead; that it was a relic of the past, and that reviving it was a recipe for disaster. 
Baz Luhrmann never listens to people like that anyway, and Moulin Rouge - his latest in a career seemingly based on flying in the face of conventional wisdom - is a stunning masterpiece of visual and musical achievement, and richly deserved all the accolades it received as one of the best films of 2001.Set in 1900, Moulin Rouge tells the story of Christian (Ewan MacGregor), a struggling writer who falls in with a group of Bohemian actors and tries to sell a show to the owner of the famed Paris nightclub Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent).  To get his pitch heard, Christian approaches the most desired courtesan in the club, Satine (Nicole Kidman), and while he finds himself smitten by the girl's obvious charms, is competing for her heart with the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), whom Zidler is wooing as an investor in the Moulin Rouge.Basically, it's a formula plot straight from the grand musicals of the fifties - girl must choose between true love and a wealthy suitor - and one of the many brilliant points of the film is that this very plot is also the subject of Christian's production: the very aptly named Spectacular Spectacular!  From the first time Christian sets foot in the Rouge, the film takes the viewer in every direction imaginable, never content with just a straightforward telling of the love story.  Everything is wrapped in dramatics and theatrics, song and dance, costumes and flair - and it's both familiar and original.  The songs are inspired in choice and arrangement, as most of them are covers of love song standards (Elton John's ""Your Song"") or very unusual choices (""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" or ""Lady Marmalade""), mixed in with some Beatles classics and Whitney Houston ballads.  But none of these are quite the same once rendered by the impeccable voice talents of Broadbent, Roxburgh, MacGregor and Kidman.  Every anguished confession of love is sung through one of these timeless lyrics (or the occasional original song, such as ""Come What May""), and woven into the story seamlessly, as if they were written directly for the screen.  Nothing seems out of place, no matter how different it might be at first glance.  Even ""Roxanne,"" by the Police, is reinvented as a tango, and is one of the more haunting set pieces as it's interspersed with Christian's budding jealousy towards the Duke. 
MacGregor and Kidman, not noted for their singing voices in the past, acquit themselves very well here, showing off good ranges and talents combined with their well-earned acting chops.  This is no throwaway story in their hands; you yearn for Satine as much as Christian does, and you weep when she weeps, and you ache when they both ache.  The Bohemian tenets of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love are all in effect here, as Luhrmann takes his vision and paints the canvas of the screen in a beautiful array of visuals that most directors would never even imagine, let alone try.  Perfect costuming, a frenetic pace, and a game cast willing to try anything for the show provide two hours of blisteringly good entertainment.  By the way, don't be ashamed if this film makes you laugh, makes you dance, makes you sing, and makes you cry.  It's worked quite hard to make you do all of those things.  Brilliant film-making.  Don't miss this one.",Moulin Rouge!
343,Serva,Why is this movie in the top 250?,4,11 December 2001,"I had very low expectations on this movie, and I was still largely disappointment. That, folks, is not good. Neither is this movie.I'll start with the good stuff. There are actually some nice moments in the beginning of the film. Of course one of the worst things is in the beginning too, but I'm getting to that. Some of the scenes, like when Christian first meets the ""Spectacular, spectacular""-gang is rather fun. The scene where they explain the play to the duke is nice too. But that's about it.Can someone explain to me, what it is causing the editor to not being able to show more than 1/100th of a second at a time of footage in most of the movie. WHY does he necessarily have to switch through all the characters all the time? Let me watch one character speak, and then the other, THANK YOU! A lot of cuts works in action sequences in action movies. It helps the action there. In perfectly ORDINARY talk scenes, they have to have cut to different directions ALL THE TIME. What is it supposed to create? Is it supposed to be ""cool""? Personally, it just gives me headache and takes away my concentration on the plot.When you write a script to a movie, there are things you leave out for the audience so there will be a reason to watch to the end of the film. This, movie, I must remind myself that that's what it is, reveals the ending right in the beginning! I suppose you could consider this a spoiler, but since it so clearly pointed out even before the real narrative starts, I can't see why I shouldn't tell it. In comparison, consider how good The Usual Suspects or Citizen Kane would be if one found out how it was going to end in the beginning.From the point where Zidler or whatever his name is, signs the contract, you know exactly how the movie is going to proceed. This is somewhere in the middle. It drags on, scene after scene. I sat there in the end, wishing it would end in a somewhat original or at least surprising way. But no, I get nothing. Except fear.Fear that it is movies like this which people are going to promote and see in the future. Movies with no plot, horrible script, very weird selection which characters to develop, appalling editing and these anachronistic songs all the time. Ok, so they're clearly modern songs, but people singing about smog around the shift of the century? No thanks.Granted a big part of the musical is the music, they still need a story to capture one's interest. You can't make a movie with special effects, we all know this, but likewise you can't make a good musical without a somewhat intriguing plot. The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sound of Music, even South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut are fine examples of great musicals with good stories.I give this movie a 4/10 just because there were some good parts (albeit very few), Nicole Kidman is good looking and Ewan McGregor was in it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go think about the hours of my life which I have lost forever. Which I could have spent on more important things like poking out that stuff which collects in your belly button. If you haven't seen this movie, but plan to, I advice you to turn on MTV for two hours.

The movie also pay an (involontary?) tribute to Terry Gilliam's and Monty Python's crazy visual style.Not the best ... but good in spite of a trite love story.A particular note for the breathless editing.My vote 7/10",Moulin Rouge!
346,DrMMGilchrist,'La Traviata' on absinthe: a dazzling triumph of old-fashioned heart & Bollywood colour,10,2 October 2001,"I went to see 'Moulin Rouge' with high expectations: I was not disappointed. On a big screen, in a traditional 'red curtain' cinema, it enveloped me in colour, music, dancing and dazzling visual fantasy. I laughed, I cried, I went out and bought the soundtrack!The plot is simple: 'La Dame aux Camélias', with added vitality from a colourful crew of comic supporting players. Behind the modernity of the visual effects and use of familiar pop songs in the soundtrack (each prompting a delighted gasp or laugh of recognition from my friends and myself), this is an old-fashioned musical with a warm, uncynical heart. It's just over 2 hours of romantic escapism - which we all need a shot of, from time to time.Our ingénu hero Christian (Ewan McGregor) arrives in Paris, fleeing his strict father, to become a writer. With echoes of 'La Bohème', he falls in with a motley crew of bohemians, or rather, *they* fall in on him. Literally. Through the ceiling. In an attempt to obtain financial backing for his friends' new play, he falls in love with the beautiful and ambitious cabaret singer and courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). Their romance is threatened by the scheming Duc de Monroth (pronounce it French-style - and remember 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend'!), who holds the deeds of the Moulin Rouge as security on gaining Satine's favours. But a still greater danger is lurking, as Satine begins to suffer fainting fits and cough blood when she comes off stage...Where Baz Luhrmann and his team have worked wonders is in revitalising the musical - a genre which has been fading in the West - by looking to the East, to Bollywood, where it has never died. 'Moulin Rouge' is essentially a westernised Bollywood film, blending comedy and tragedy with stunning visual style and lively song-and-dance numbers. The climactic scene from the Indian-themed show Christian has written, 'Spectacular Spectacular!' acknowledges the film's key stylistic influence.Meanwhile, Christian's public humiliation of Satine, hurling money at her feet, is straight from the original Dumas novel. The carpet of scattered red and white petals which surround the lovers at the tragic end - long anticipated, but still heart-wrenching when it comes - are surely a nod to Marguerite Gautier's camellias. If the modernity of approach has jarred some ears, well, a previous, less humorous musical version had similar problems in the 1850s: but Verdi's 'La Traviata' nevertheless has been a great hit ever since!There are also nods to other influences: the Méliès-inspired 'magic lantern slide' vistas of Paris, lit by a smiling, singing moon; and 'La Fée Verte' - Kylie Minogue's red-eyed Absinthe Fairy - zipping over the city and illuminating it with her wand in a cheeky parody of the Disney version of Tinker Bell!The songs have been used effectively, to advance the story and illuminate character. 'El Tango de Roxanne' is a particularly striking piece, underscoring the tensions and jealousies when Satine is on the point of sacrificing herself to the Duc. The 'Elephant Love Medley' is delightful - funny and romantic, while 'On with the Show' makes the most of the dramatic power inherent in so many 'Queen' songs. And I will never hear 'Like a Virgin' again without thinking of its use as a comedy number by the endearing Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler...!'Moulin Rouge' is an enchanting way to spend an evening. It glitters and shimmers like Art Nouveau favrile glass. The costumes, sets, photography and choreography deserve every award going! I can see this film becoming a standard Christmas classic when it reaches TV, or becoming a cult movie, with sing-along audiences dressing up as the characters. Certainly joining in with boos, cheers, and laughs is an essential part of the fun! To be watched with a shot of 'Green Fairy' close at hand! I cannot wait to see what Baz Luhrmann - the cinematic 'Wizard of Oz' - will do next!",Moulin Rouge!
347,Lady Jasmine,Wonderful,10,5 February 2002,"I own the DVD set of this movie, and it is an addition to my growing collection I will never regret. It took me twice to the theatre to really understand this movie...but I came out loving it both times, the second time I just loved it more. It is not exactly what I would classify as a spectacular movie musical...for that you have to back to the classics, but it has an undeniable appeal all it's own. I have heard a lot of people say to me that this movie plays like a music video, that the songs are fit oddly into the story and many other things. But, after years of seeing musicals and being in them, I have to wonder if there is a single musical out there that doesn't have people randomly bursting into song at odd times (see the Gotta Dance number in Singing in the Rain if you don't believe me). This movie is not meant to be logical, it's meant to be a moving, dazzling, tantalizing appeal to all the senses, and in that it succeeds remarkably.",Moulin Rouge!
348,fog-9,post modern,7,6 February 2006,"moulin rouge seems to be a movie that fiercely divides people...although i am not a great fan of musicals, moulin rouge manages to force feed you absinthe and drag you through the streets of Paris that never were... yes, it is not a deep movie... the performances are over the top... that is baz luhrman's modus operandi.. this movie establishes its agenda early and does not apologise for it... it is a sumptuous honey drowning visual romp...the use of modern songs is, in my opinion, brilliant ... i've read lots of comments vilifying the movie for its incorporation of modern pop culture, and to those people i'd like to say: 1) contemporary pop music has some good, witty lyrics (admittedly not everything in MR fits the bill)... no less than many older, ""classic"" musicals...2) all genres adapt... just because this is ""not done"" in musicals, according to some arbitrary panel of experts, doesn't mean anything... it's been done now, and it is a post modern film... that's what it set out to be, and importantly, it pulled it off... it may not work in every movie, but the skill of the director has made the difference...3) i'm not going to pretend that hearing ""smells like teen spirit"" mangled didn't hurt, but as used in the film, it fits the context and is a justifiable choice... i'll deal with it...4) if some people would be objective, they would concede that the arrangements in MR show that popular music translates easily into the light opera setting, with the correct treatment...5) this is a possible springboard to convert people who don't like musicals...now, the editing and camera-work is frenetic, but it displays a sense of style completely unique to the director... people compare this to music videos, but apart from the speed and energy, i don't see it... luhrman may use common elements but he does impart his own sensibilities... the music video business is categorised by how similar all the products are (and some music videos do break the mould and provide exceptional visuals anyway)...the sets and costumes are magical... there is no denying it... jim broadbent is superb, and those who say mcgregor can't sing are just fools, or bitter...if you accept that just about nothing is original (certainly not the churned out musicals of the early days of Hollywood, that quickly established stereotypes and parameters that are still being used by bollywood) and that post modern works can be valid, vital entertainment, then you will accept that moulin rouge is wildly enjoyable... it is a slight movie in some respects, but there are flashes of gravity amidst all the noise, fervour and pomp...i think baz luhrman has pushed the genre of screen musical forward (kicking and screaming), and this is commendable... i think he has even prophesied the backlash in an earlier movie (the brilliant ""strictly ballroom"") which had the dancer hero chastised for ""flashy, new steps""... the light musical has often been a platform for light, sparkling entertainment, and a little injection of flash can be easily dismissed by purists... but those adventurous viewers in pursuit of a good time will find it, come what may...",Moulin Rouge!
349,pearceduncan,The best thing since Suspiria,10,28 April 2002,"Despite being an Australian movie in the year of Lord of the Rings, Moulin Rouge is my favourite recent movie. It's pure cinema, a melange of sight and sound, song and dance, tragedy and comedy and True Love as it only exists in the movies. Having two of the best actors in movies, Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent, doesn't hurt either.Moulin Rouge is pure spectacle in the manner of Dario Argento's 1978 horror movie Suspiria. Despite dealing with very different emotional sets, these two movies go together in my mind. They also fit nicely in the ""love it or hate it"" category. Baz Luhrmann's previous movies, Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juliet, were nice surprises for me; I expected each of them to be crap, but enjoyed both thoroughly. I ended up with high expectations for Moulin Rouge, and I was not disappointed. Toss your cynicism out the window and have fun with it.",Moulin Rouge!

It's easy, state the facts. In excess of 85% of the movies' dialogue was not spoken, but sung. I am a big fan of Nicole Kidman's work, but I lost interest in this movie about 15 minutes after it began, and incidentally that's about how long it seemed before Nicole Kidman appeared on the screen. I don't walk out on movies very often, in fact it's a very rare thing that I even leave the theatre before the credits are finished rolling. But, now and then it's necessary to bite the bullet and say that's enough and walk towards the exits.

351,ignatiusloyala,Too much a Titanic,7,22 December 2001,"I have seen this film, and I rush to comment on it here. Well, I just come up with an idea: this is a new Titanic story. Why? See here: 1. Satine(Rose) and Christian(Jack) come from different societies. 2. Satine(Rose) meets Christian(Jack) 3. They fall in love. 4. But there is a third-party here intruding into this affair: the Duke(Carl) 5. They try to hide it, but it is discovered at last. 6. The Duke(Carl) forces Satine(Rose) to leave Christian(Jack). Zidler(Rose's mother) advises Satine(Rose) to obey. 7. Satine(Rose) unwillingly says something to Christian(Jack) to break his heart. 8. On the stage, Satine and Christian(Jack and Rose) finally find that they really love each other. 9. The Duke(Carl) goes mad: he first hires a man to kill Christian(Jack), and then he picks up the gun himself. Failed. 10. The Duke(Carl) surrenders and leaves. 11. Oops. Satine(this time, she is Jack) is dying, telling Christian(Rose): hey, you should go on(you will never let go. Promise me now, Rose...) 12. Satine(Jack) is dead.Don't you think the film is simply a modified version of Titanic?I can't say the film is very bad, but at least it is far from great. The opening kills me. It's too exaggerating and the music is terrible. The film-makers apparently did this deliberately but I don't think it's good at all.The middle part is better: when Satine and Christian fall in love, and then part again. However, this doesn't continue. The ending is bad. When the door on the stage is opened, the good part ends. In fact, the way the show continues is stupid. It's over-emotional and the gun thing is not interesting at all. That 'high-flyer' just comes as a shock and spoils the original good scene. And as I have said, the very last scenes are poor and I don't want to comment on them any further.The love story is quite cheesy. I don't mean that it's not impressive or heart-rending, but hey, can there be anything fresher? We go to movie to see something new but not some old plots already marked as antique in a museum! In a nutshell, Moulin Rouge is not a surprise in every sense.Average: B to B-",Moulin Rouge!

I thought I might have been one of those people, but alas, I found myself sinking in my seat in vicarious embarrassment for all who appeared on screen. The movie looks like it might try to have a story, but quickly decides this is too hard. Much easier is to throw up a bunch of spectacle and colors and some good-looking actors (who unfortunately open their mouths eventually). Had I paid more than US$1.50 for my seat, I would have been fuming mad. As it was, I was only a little bit mad for the waste of time and the damage to my faith in humanity.

353,Diego_rjc,I'm not sure if I appreciate Baz Luhrmann's style...,7,28 January 2010,"When 'Moulin Rouge!' came out, in 2001, its director, Baz Luhrmann, was already 39 years old, but had made only three other movies, 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo + Juliet'. So, assuming this is only his third film, and the third of his 'Red Curtain Trilogy', he still has a lot to grow as a director, after all, it generally takes years for a director to hit the jackpot, but of course there are exceptions like John Huston and his exceptional 'The Maltese Falcon' as his first movie.'Moulin Rouge!' tells the story of Christian (Ewan McCregor), a young English writer that travels to 1899 Bohemian Paris. There, he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan of the Moulin Rouge, the main nightclub of the city underworld. The problem is when he falls in love with her, but she is already committed to The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), a very rich man. Throughout the movie, most of the main characters tell the audience that this is a story about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all things, love. And it is indeed. All four of them are a very important part of the story, which is very well-told, by the way, starting off a year after the main events, with Christian writing what happened. And it's all told with really good dance numbers.The acting is nice. We have the two leads, Ewan McCregor and Nicole Kidman, playing their parts well, and singing their own songs. We have other stars like John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh. No one really stands out, but you can see the actors did their jobs exactly as they were told to. As I mentioned, Baz Luhrmann still has a lot to grow as a director, but at least the guy has a lot of style. The landscapes of Paris were one of the best scenes I've seen in a musical, great mix-up of 3-D effects and real shots. You can see all his potential in those scenes. This movie is a perfect portrayal of Bohemian Paris, wild, senseless, and weird. The way he mixed up lots of famous songs of the 20th century to tell the story is brilliant. In here, we have songs by Madonna, David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, Nirvana and many others, and it works really good. The art direction is excellent, but too modern for my taste. The main problem I have with this movie is the editing, too claustrophobic. When you start to get into one scene, it jumps to another and you get dazzled.Overral, even though I'm not sure if I appreciate Baz Luhrmann's style, it's undeniable the effort he and his crew putted into the making of this movie. The problem I have with 'Moulin Rouge!' is simply a matter of taste - too modern for me.7/10",Moulin Rouge!
354,barfly99,Dazzling but totally empty...,2,21 October 2001,"It is a depressing indictment of Hollywood that a film such as MOULIN ROUGE is apparently considered to be one of the best films to emerge from Tinseltown in recent years. Visually it is certainly fantastic, and - assuming your taste is very much in the mainstream - it must have value in purely musical terms. But it is also a soulless and in my mind rather cynical film, and one that demonstrates contempt for many fundamentals of good cinema.The cinematographer, choreographer, special effects team and so on should all be congratulated for some dazzling work. Indeed I'm sure many of these people will be nominated for Oscars. And so they should be. However the plaudits should end there.Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it customary for a fictional film drama (whether musical or otherwise) to have a story and/or some characters? MOULIN ROUGE's lame excuse for a ""story"" is in fact revealed in a Ewan McGregor voice-over in the first reel of the film. There are no twists, no surprises, no sub-plots...in short it is feebly, depressingly, almost mind-numbingly predictable from first minute to last. Characterization fares no better, with no hint of personality detectable in any of the protagonists (the Duke comes closest by at least being a caricature - MacGregor, Kidman, etc don't even get that). This is truly one of the most lazily written films I have ever seen.Of course it could be quite reasonably argued that the very same criticism could be leveled at all sorts of films, and that is true enough. However MOULIN ROUGE has the breathtaking temerity to purport to be about ""truth, beauty, freedom, love"". It could not have chosen grander themes, and could not have made a more pitiful attempt at exploring them. In fact the film is so wretchedly written that at absolutely no point does it ever, even once, make a sincere effort to engage the audience on an emotional or intellectual level. Of course the renditions of 'Your Song' might have brought a tear to the eye to some, but if so then the credit is due entirely to Elton John, and no more due to Baz Luhrmann than it is to a radio DJ who plays it on Heart FM or whatever. The great musicals, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, TOP HAT and so on did actually bother with an involving and emotive screenplay between numbers. CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG had more of a script than this.MOULIN ROUGE is the product of someone being given a lot of money to make a big crowd-pleasing movie, and him making it without actually having anything whatsoever to say. To me a great cinematic spectacle comes from having an idea and building a film around it; not from hiring some big stars, spending the GDP of a small country on SFX, and then rather grudgingly putting a story and some characters in it as an afterthought.If you are attuned to its humour then I can see how this could be a fun movie to watch, but if you expect something more than an extended MTV video for your time and money, it's a wearying and ultimately rather insulting film. MOULIN ROUGE isn't - even for one second - about truth, beauty, freedom, or love. It's about making as much money as possible for the people behind it.",Moulin Rouge!

The range of emotions that streaked across me was incredible: I went from laughing my heart out to biting my nails in anticipation. I went from screaming in agony on the inside to giggling hysterically. That is a very powerful feeling, and one which the exceptional director Baz Luhurmann played upon us wonderfully well. The movie was extraordinary, I thought. With generous, visual segments which made me dizzy with bliss, from tearjerker scenes where I did indeed feel my eyes welling up and tears running down my cheeks. That is the first time I've ever cried in a movie (except for a LONG time ago when I saw The Bear, but that doesn't count...). Major kudos to Ewan McGregor, whom I didn't realize had the emotional intensity to play such an in-depth character, and Nicole Kidman, whom I formerly despised but now adore because of her incredible range and raw talent. Their performances left me shocked, scarred, above all else...pleased. ""Moulin Rouge"" is a movie I would love to buy, see again and again, and discuss.

The aspects that don't work, well, oh brother.Things that work-Nicole Kidman-she steals the show with her classic beauty, charm, charisma and sheer star power. She was perfect casting.-The sets- The sets were beautiful. You can tell a lot of work was put in these stunning sets. They're wonderful eye candy._The costumes- I wanted to design costumes for plays when I was young.So I was impressed with the outfits. Heck if I was twenty pounds thinner I would use similar dresses for Halloween._Ewan Mcgregor -Even though through the whole movie all he does is act lovesick and pout. For people who only know him as Obi-Wan it shows his wide range of talent. Bad things about the movie_The music-There's just something wrong about using Nirvana and madonna songs for 19th century France. It's just tacky. It's almost as if Baz Luhrman thinks that modern audiences won't tolerate showtunes so top 40 hits must be used. I understand his logic on using modern music, but it almost insulting for musical lovers.-The love story- I watched this after having a massive fight with my finance so maybe I was too cynical. But it's so phony and Disney-esque. But how could anybody not be cynical about falling in love in three seconds over a Elton John song? -the shrieking- how come all through out the first half on the movie every character was to shriek and yell their lines? I found it very annoying.
On a another note Is it just me or does Nicole Kidman seems to beautiful and active for someone who is dying? Also doesn't the Duke look amazingly like David Spade?Over all a very mixed bag. I'm a musical fan and I wasn't sure what to make of it. From reading the reviews people adore or just don't get it. I'm in the middle.",Moulin Rouge!

It is a movie that made me laugh and it made me cry and most of all it made me want to love and be loved in return.      The singing and dancing was amazing.  During the opening dance sequence was a little odd to see it for the first time and the choices of songs they chose were a little interesting (Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit is one example) but all in all it was fun.  But what made me first love the movie was when the first time Ewan McGreggor sang.  I just fell in love wih the movie from that point on.  That was an amazingly beautiful version of Your Song.  I get chills just thinking about it.  Another part that made me want to sing and dance was the Spectacular Spectacular part.  When they were telling the Duke what the musical was going to be about.  ""Spectacular, Spectacular, it's not in your vernacular.""  And Come What May.  What can I possibly say about that beautiful song.  Ewan and Nicole sang it so perfectly together, their voices just make the song even more special.  It should have won for Best Song at the Golden Globes.  That was a scam. The direction by Baz Luhrmann was visionary.  I never saw anything like it before and it was amazing. Christian believes that all you need is love and above all things is love.

Where other musicals have their 'own' songs, Moulin Rouge! uses pop-songs from the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's to carry the whole film and it works great, even if the film plays in 1899 and 1900.McGregor and Kidman, the two leads playing Christian and Satine, are a perfect match and this combination will be placed in movie history along with other classic couples like Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca and Leigh and Gable in Gone With the Wind. Time has to tell if Moulin Rouge! will become a classic like these two, but it looks good for Moulin Rouge! It's my favorite film of the year (closely followed by A.I. and Fellowship of the Ring has yet to come!)Baz Luhrmann is absolutely brilliant, something we could've seen already in Romeo + Juliette. It seems he doesn't know what an anachronism is, but that's completely fine with me. In the hands of a lesser director this could've been a very bad film, but it all turned out perfect.My favorite part is where Christian and Satine are on the top of the Elephant and start singing several songs (or at least a few lines of them) in one brilliant scene.Is there anything wrong with this film? Perhaps the first half hour is sometimes too much, but it delivers great cinema. And, like said before, the script is a collection of cliches, but in this case it didn't bother me, because the film had tons and tons of other things to offer. These small minor points are nothing against the pro's the film has to offer. Just see it... no, EXPERIENCE it!I wonder why it did so poorly at the box-office? Are people not ready for it? Were it the poor reviews of critics who praised The Mummy Returns and Pearl Harbor (both: worthless, especially in comparison with Moulin Rouge!) and thought Moulin Rouge! was a mediocre film? I don't know. Maybe one day we'll know...To be short:This one will blast you out of your seat and has to be seen in the theater. It's a total cinematic explosion!

363,cathcacr,"Stunning visuals, Disney story",7,28 April 2002,"The raves about this film all include reference to the fact that this film is a feast for the senses.  And, visually, it is mighty impressive.  Lavish set design and art direction (an Oscar must-win in this category) are the primary virtues of this film, and mark out its uniqueness.  Other than that, though, you get a storyline that's not nearly as easy to appreciate, one that's been done time and time aplenty in a Disney movie (well, except for the ending). On the whole you get an above-average movie, worth viewing at least once (several times if you like the striking visuals), but I think one could come up with several other movies meriting consideration for best-film nominations before this one.But as to the visuals, it does raise the question: is this the most visually impressive movie ever?  It's certainly among the most *impressive* ever, though I wouldn't categorize it as one of the most visually *beautiful* films ever.  For that, I would nominate _Barry Lyndon_.  It's a feast for the eyes, but like everything else Kubrick, it doesn't bombard you, as _Moulin Rouge!_ does.  And the first 15 minutes or so of _Moulin Rouge!_ are just plain dizzying; there's no time to really take in anything in particular.

Yes, it is fast-paced and frenetic. Yes, it is predictable. It is supposed to be all of these things. But at the heart of all this frantic art, there lies one of the sweetest, most beautiful love stories in all of filmdom. Seeing Nicole Kidman (as Satine,the realistic courtesan ) and Ewan McGregor (as Christian, the innocent young amorist) in this movie causes a re-thinking of what great chemistry is: It always, always seems to me that these two people are truly in love with one another. It is a testimony to Baz Lurhmann that this film is so sincere. So many movies today cop out and play it safe. Here is a film that wholeheartedly believes in something, and isn't ashamed of it.",Moulin Rouge!
365,Mrswing,Like being served a disgusting burger in a three-star restaurant,1,24 January 2002,"God, how I detest this film (though in all fairness I liked the opening credits). I hate most of the songs(so I'm a devotee of the Great American Songbook - sue me), the dances (which aren't THAT great, see the DVD) are obscured by MTV-on-speed cutting, the story, though 'mythical' is so thin and predictable that I cannot understand how anyone could be moved by this (or why it took Lurmann and his co-writer so long to get the story 'right' - it's a direct steal from La Bohème/ La dame au Camélias). And though Ewan and Nicole's performances are decent, I am not a fan of either performer and really couldn't care less about them. So at the tragic finale I just laugh scornfully at the deliberate tearjerking instead of being (even slightly) moved. On top of this, the vulgarity and over-the-top camp act as total turnoffs for me. If someone wants to 'reinvent' the musical, why not DO IT LIKE THEY USED TO, going for real charm and delighting in the sensuousness of performance instead of having the director ego-trip the whole time through (why can't any director understand that in musicals THE PERFORMERS DANCE WHILE THE CAMERA STAYS STILL???!!!) Definitely one of the most irritating film experiences of the year. But what can one expect from a film which, while claiming to use the 'best ever songs of the twentieth century', opens with the abysmally wretched 'Nature Boy'??? I am so glad I only saw this on a review copy DVD - any money I had to pay for it would have been daylight robbery.",Moulin Rouge!
366,pc_dean,"Too Much Avant, Not Enough Garde",3,7 July 2001,"I am not the target audience for this movie.  I'm not even anywhere downrange.  I think I realized this when Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang a duet that incorporated a gamut of musical soundbites from Elton John to Whitney Houston, without once touching on a song that I don't personally loathe.  The rather odd and jokey placement of modern catchphrases and lyrics in 1900 Paris was actually not as annoying as I had feared; it was often fun to try and catch all the references.  But eventually, it degenerated into a tired gimmick.  And if ""Your Song"" ever comes on my car radio again, I'll have to change the station quick or swerve into a tree or something.The anachronistic song placement is minor compared to the other sins of ""Moulin Rouge"", which is basically just a Concept masquerading as a movie. There's the story to consider, which seems as if Baz Luhrmann and his accomplice screenwriter just took every cliche they could find (plus a ""Smooth 70's"" compilation CD) and put them in a blender set on ""frappe"", then threw the mixture against the wall, in the vain hope that something might stick.  It would have been helpful to have some kind of meta-subtitles to help us through the story (ATTENTION: For the next few minutes, this film will be channelling ""Camille"".  Please stand by.)  When the story hits a standstill, the movie just repeats its mantras (some yada-yada about Truth and Beauty, and Learning to Love and Be Loved, or something like that) as a way to jump-start the narrative and wake the audience.Luhrmann's directing style is non-stop frenetic and exhausting, with all the subtlety and nuance of a stainless steel rolling pin.  It doesn't work with this material.  He did the same thing with ""Romeo + Juliet"", but at least there he had a better screenwriter.  The showy visuals and strange angles don't so much inform the story as try to distract you from it.  The Concept is everything here, and it rules ""Moulin Rouge"" with an iron fist.  When a few of the scenes actually threaten to develop cinematic merit on some level, the Concept quickly batters them into submission, and the result is an unholy mess.  If incoherence were bullets, this would be a John Woo movie.The acting is terrible as well.  The two leads manage relatively well (Kidman's version of ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" won't make anyone forget Monroe, but it's a treat anyhow), but the rest of the cast is content to chew the scenery, spit it up, and chew it some more.  John Leguizamo is a particular disappointment.  The man has talent, and when he's on, he's the smartass Peter Lorre of his generation.  When he's not, he just yells a lot. Some actors have made a career out of being the best thing in bad movies; Leguizamo seems content to go down with the ship.You can practically see the sweat stains on this movie as Luhrmann strives to pack as much crap onscreen as possible.  The last time anyone was trying this hard in a movie, it was Jude Law crossing the Volga over the objections of homicidal Stukas in ""Enemy at the Gates"".  When it comes to pitiless annihilation, Stukas ain't got nothing on Art.Ah, well, we'll always have Paris.",Moulin Rouge!
367,isotope2112,"Good concept, but ultimately a very flawed film.",2,11 April 2002,"I honestly don't understand the hype about this movie.  The acting was mediocre at best.  The cinematography was good, but it was damaged by poor editing.  Flashy, quick scene cuts dominate this film.  The plot was predictable and I thought the dialogue was too fast and furious to even keep up with in many places and I personally disliked the usage of 80's/90's pop and rock lyrics and music.  I will say I was amazed at how well Ewan McGregor could sing; he blew Nicole Kidman out of the water.I found ""Moulin Rouge!"" insipid and uninspired.  Ultimately, blame for this film's flaws can be laid squarely on the director Baz Luhrmann (who also co-wrote the screenplay).  At least it wasn't as bad Luhrmann's butchering of Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet (1996).  4/10",Moulin Rouge!
368,evancyl,Captivating musical retelling of a familiar story,8,23 July 2014,"Moulin Rouge's plot - beautiful young actress falls in love with impoverished writer but is compelled to be with wealthy patron - is nothing unfamiliar. But the music which the story is set to is excellent; think modern-day love songs transported to 19th-century Paris. The sets and costumes and dance routines were a feast for the eyes. And Nicole Kidman was brilliant as Satine; cold and hardened by the realities of the world, but tantalising and genuine as Christian's lover. While her falling for him seemed a bit too sudden, it was believable enough in the musical context. The movie isn't thought-provoking if you've been exposed to similar stories, but it is certainly high in artistic and entertainment value.",Moulin Rouge!

Benjamin). In comparison to the ironic adaptation of the genre that has made Woody Allen, or to the powerful ""tragedization"" made by Lars von Trier, Baz Luhrmann, as always tasteless and free of esthetic inhibitions, uses the musical to retell unbearable stories: Nicole Kidman is, if we think in Greta Garbo o the verbal portraits of Elonora Duse, an ice-cold and uninteresting ""Dame aux camelies"", Ewan McGregor's character lacks of any interest - everything lays in the eclectic rodeo of camera, costumes and music. There are some original findings, of course, like the ""Roxanne!""-Tango or the Madonna imitations, even the fairy-tale-like Quartier Latin... But of course: one who is going to play with EVERYTHING, necessarily will find some golden eggs.

372,strangie,"Truth, beauty, freedom, love - all in a day's work for Moulin Rouge",10,23 May 2001,"This is probably a biased review, given that I have long been a fan of Baz Luhrmann's works.  His envelope pushing has, what I think is, an Australian freshness about it - which is perhaps why it has received mixed reviews. 
The story is simple Christian (Ewan McGregor) has come to Paris, to Montmartre (the bohemian capital of France), to seek out freedom, truth, beauty and love. He enters the infamous nightclub the Moulin Rouge where he's instantly smitten by the courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). She mistakes him for the Duke (the fabulous Richard Roxburgh in a brilliantly slimy role) who she's meant to seduce for money for a new play Christian is writing. But just like so many musical comedies the mistake strikes sparks of romance. Excellent cameo roles from Australian musical icons - Kylie Minogue, Christine Anu, Jackson Mendoza, Caroline O'Connor as well as well rounded performances from Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo, David Wenham, Gary McDonald and Jacek Koman as a narcaleptic Argentinian.This is a complete rollercoaster ride - you run the gamut of emotions and with typical Baz style there's oodles of humour in it.  It's glitzzy glamourous, fast moving, funny, sad and entirely well worth the almost 2 wait for it to come to the screens.  The music, also, is extraordinary. From Elton John, to Marilyn Munroe, to Madonna, U2, Moby, Sting - together with a brilliant score.By the way - it's worth staying to the end of the credits for a small reminder of what the film is about.",Moulin Rouge!
373,ProperCharlie,"Spectacular, Spectacular",10,1 November 2001,"**SPOILERS ARE CONTAINED HEREIN. BEWARE FOOLHARDY READERS!**You know if you take out the songs, slow down the editing, keep the heroine alive at the end, split the Duke into two characters (the Money and the Evil Love Interest), send it back in time by about 250 years and move it about 200 miles or so North West and you've got Shakespeare in Love.Moulin Rouge isn't an original film, it doesn't have an original editing style, it doesn't have original songs, the acting is good but not great, the singing *is* great although the comedy can grate, and the plot is seemingly ripped from another film which mimics another story (already covered by Baz) and that is being taken to court for plagiarism (did you follow that?)What Moulin Rouge is however, is *magic*.Magic is what cinema is all about.  A piece of cinema can be original with excellent score, acting, direction, cinematography, script and all the rest but still not light up that part of you that will stay glowing and warm all the way through a tortuous tube trip home.I'm still smiling now and my whole being is suffused with a warm fuzzy feeling that I don't want to let go of.Leave your intellect at the door, prepare to be smacked round the chops by visuals that will blind you as completely as prolonged absinthe use, and let your ears fill with at least three of the past thirty years more popular songs being sung at the same time and at immense volume. 10/10Shakespeare in Love got lots of Oscars.  I wonder what the Academy will make of this?",Moulin Rouge!
374,CHendri887,What a mess,1,17 June 2001,"Can you say ""technicolor vomit?""  The idea for this film actually has a lot of potential:  Take a mish-mash of modern pop songs and blend them together in a creative way to create a romantic musical.  But what do we get here? An annoying nightmare of sound and sight that almost drove me from the theater.  This film is more chopped up than the vegetables in a Beni Hanna stir fry.  Luhrmann never focuses on one scene for more than a few seconds and when he does, the computer enhanced colors make the screen incredibly difficult to look at.  The music has moments of creativity, as when ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is blended together with ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"", but all of the scenes come across as little more than videos, not pieces creating a coherent whole.  With respect to the choice of songs: Gosh, can you get more random, Boz Luhrmann?  I mean, I actually feel like Luhrman put a couple hundred song titles in a hat and just chose them at random.  Very strange.  And I enjoyed Ewen McGregor's singing for about an hour (I found myself singing ""Your Song"" with him at the beginning of the film), but then it started to get annoying.  And Nicole Kidman...what can one say except, ""Yuck.""  Ever since I saw her in that Battman movie, she just bugs, bugs, bugs.  And I was listening to a PJ Harvey tape in my car on the way home from the theater thinking that Harvey would have been a great choice for the part of Seline.  But she probably wouldn't have been interested in such an artless film.  Finally, why o why does every big budget movie that is set in France have people speaking with British accents?  Is this some kind of unconscious Hollywood rule?  Or couldn't Luhrmann find anyone with French accents to play in this film?  Man, the French must have torn this thing up at Cannes.

376,zeedunn,Magic,10,24 November 2008,"I believe Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece is what re-ignited interest in the movie musical. Everything about this movie keeps you captivated. The characters do an impressive job. Ewan McGregor is convincing as the starry-eyed idealistic poet who falls in love with Satine. He sees nothing but her, and his face lights up when she walks into the room. Nicole Kidman does a decent job in her role as well, although all she has to do is be gorgeous and tantalizing. Towards the end of the movie, she does pick up her game and presents a haunting portrait of a woman who knows she has doomed herself to a life of torment without her love. Both of them do fine as singers. I am sure their voices were touched up a lot, but who cares? The supporting cast is great as well. The Duke sneers effectively. Jim Broadbent as Harold Zigler is great as the manager of the Moulin Rouge. He is a kind man, although his first love is his theater. He truly is sorry he has to ask Satine to sacrifice herself, but not sorry enough that he is willing to see the Moulin Rouge go bankrupt. He has a great number towards the end called The Show Must Go On. My favorite supporting actor by far has to be John Leguizamo, a Baz Luhrmann regular. He plays the dwarfed version of Toulouse-Lautrec well and represents all that glitters in the Bohemian. He believes in truth, beauty, and love and wants everyone around him to have all 3 if possible.The music is breathtaking. I always cry during the Come What May at the end of the show. And the look of the film is just beautiful. It makes the Moulin Rouge look like a beautiful carnival of sound, color, and melody.The pacing is just right. I understand that Luhrmann has a background in opera. This truly shows in his ability to make powerful use of the music mixed with the pictures. He has knowledge of how to play his audience. I was also impressed with how he created just the right mix of tragedy and comedy. During Act II, a very dark act, he throws in a light number, Like a Virgin, which provides needed comic relief. There is also the stunning dance number Roxanne, which makes effective use of the montage technique using scenes from both the dancers and the turmoil happening upstairs in an erotic tango. He truly builds tension to the breaking point.I highly recommend this movie for a romantic evening, a girls' night, or as a pick me up.",Moulin Rouge!
377,Pigbelly,Crap with a capital C,1,9 January 2005,"I have the distinct feeling Baz Luhrmann would like to direct MTV videos. The quick cuts and glossy look of this film reminds me of a Spice Girl's video and has about as much of a story. This film is such an ode to MTV culture that I would call it ""irritating to the eyes"". The ultra-quick MTV cuts and the pointless focus on eroticism trivialize any attempt at a plot. Moulin Rouge is the ""Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"" set in France with the addition of an extremely irritating cinematic style. Baz Luhrmann began his career with melodramatic schlock (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet) and has now out done himself. The popularity of this film is understandable as the average movie goer and music buyer indulges in what is heavily promoted but the discerning viewer should realize what an irritating piece of celluloid crap this movie is.

If you want to see an original, good musical, see the episode of Lexx entitled Brigadoom.Beauty --  To paraphrase Wendell Lawson (only because I can't find the exact quote):  It looks like something Walt Disney threw up.Freedom --  Okay, maybe there is some semblance of a yearning for freedom in this film, but I can't really tell.Love -- If your idea of love includes manipulation, coercion, deception, and mammon, then it has it in spades.Okay, I don't know anything about bohemians, and I don't really care, but if you want to see a film that embodies real ideals of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all, love, then see Life is Beautiful.But, if your goal is to slosh your brain around without consuming alcohol, this will get you a hangover sized headache within twenty minutes.Whatever you choose, good luck!",Moulin Rouge!

People may pay more attention to it for it's astounding technical abilities, but I was mainly captivated by it's music, acting, and it's storyline. Not to say I didn't like the color and razor sharp editing, quite the contrary. I was purely amazed at what they achieved. But that they could go over that and send a clear cut and emotional story with superb acting, is something you rarely see in any ""super charged"" films.The story is loosely based on the Greek Tragedy about Orhpeus.

Eventually they both become enmeshed in their love for each other, the dirty and treacherous goings on of the MR, and the making of the show. After betrayal and intrigue, the film ends with a tragic ending you knew was coming from Christian's first line: ""This story is about love...the woman I loved is.....dead.""The acting is much better than I expected.

McGregor particularly surprised me. I had known he was a good actor, but not as good as he is in this film. He also goes through stages, and pulls it off with his ability to act completly natural. He's by far one of the best natural actors I've ever seen, and some of his body language and facial gestures do the role a great deal of good. It's hard to act ""innocent"" without getting terribly annoying, and he's never annoying, but maybe because he's more of a decent and kind character than the stereotypical ""innocent"". Supporting characters shine, and John Leguizamo deserves a thumbs up for a particularly painful but strong performance (if you hear how they shortened him). Jim Broadbent, who plays the enabling and sweet pimp Zidler (it's tough to call him that, but that's what he is), is fantastic, and Richard Roxborough who plays the Duke, is notorious and does a wonderful job at being completely and one hundred percent devious.This movie shines, and it addicts you. Many people have said you either love it or hate it, and I'd say it's true. It will either overwhelm you, or you'll like it for all it is. It's supposed to be overboard.

383,FilmSchoolWriter,"A bizarre, eclectic, perfect confection of everything that is spectacular",10,3 December 2005,"If you haven't seen Moulin Rouge yet, go and rent it. Moulin Rouge is, to say the least, perfect. It's haunting, leaving you with a lingering wish for the movie to continue on for eternity. Easily one of the best and most original movies of recent history, everyone will find something in Moulin Rouge that they can enjoy.Baz Luhrmann creates a spectacular experience for the audience. With the gorgeous storyline, amazing costumes and sets, wonderful music and flawless acting, this is one emotional ride that you get onto with the opening credits and than get off of at the ending credits. I can guarantee you that you will walk away from Moulin Rouge with some strong emotion in your chest. There are very few movies that are done exquisitely without flaws (such as To Kill a Mockingbird and The Godfather), and Moulin Rouge is one of them. Luhrmann does an amazing job of capturing the essence of the Moulin Rouge club and showing the audience the things that come with the glitz and sex and glamor.I've never been a big fan of Nicole Kidman, but she is amazing as Satine. And her voice is beautiful. However, I for one do not really feel that she really deserved the Oscar nomination she received. In my mind, that nomination should have been given to either Ewan McGregor or Jim Broadbent. Broadbent is so wonderful, entering into that happy middle ground where you don't know whether to love his character or despise him. However, the really wonderful performance is given by Ewan McGregor. His emotions are shown in perfect clarity and it is his performance that really shows off the emotions that Moulin Rouge is all about.Go out and rent Moulin Rouge and I can promise you that you won't regret it. If I could, I would give it better than a 10/10. Enjoy.",Moulin Rouge!

I'm happy for her, but for her to go on and on about she broke a barrier that was already done for her; maybe more black people would win if they started doing movies that required more range than ""How High""). THis was an incredible movie with an incredible cast with an incredible director.  END OF DISCUSSION.",Moulin Rouge!

387,rkeaney,"""It's Quite Modern but if your open i think you might enjoy it""",10,2 April 2007,"Moulin Rouge!, directed by Baz Luhrmann who most of you will know from the modern take on Romeo + Juliet. If You have seen Romeo + Juliet than you have most likely already decided that you like his style or not.As with Romeo + Juliet, i adore Moulin Rouge. From its wacky beginning to its spine tingling and heartbreaking final act. The songs are magnificent, using modern lyrics and incorporating them into excellent songs was a great idea. The acting is superb with amazing performances from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McCregor who, not only played their parts to perfection but sung in all their roles and did it amazingly well. I love everything about Moulin Rouge, every song, every scene and every line. For me there is absolutely no faults at all in this modern Masterpiece.One thing is for certain, you will either love it or hate it. For some people i appreciate it just might not be your type of movie but if you give it a chance and love it like i did then you will witness one of the most groundbreaking modern masterpieces in recent history that i'm sure you will watch and re-watch over and over again.As for the co-stars, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh are all excellent in their roles. This movie is amazing and one not to be missed for its audience pleasing style,its amazing set design,costumes and songs, its excellent acting and storytelling and it's utter difference from anything you might have seen previously.10/10- Amazing,beautiful,heart-breaking, one of the best movies i have ever seen.",Moulin Rouge!
388,Twillhead,You'll Either Love It or You'll Hate It ...,9,3 March 2002,"... because I cannot imagine feeling neutral about this film. I happened to love it, although I admit that it took me fifteen to twenty minutes to adjust to its frenetic pacing, its farcical tone, and its fanciful melodramatic presentation. 'Moulin Rouge!' is a film to contend with; its images are sometimes spectacularly beautiful, at other times dark and nightmarish. It looks like one or all of the following could have directed it: Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Orson Welles, and Bob Fosse. Set in 1899 in the Montemarte section of Paris, during the rise of the bohemian movement and awash with colorful characters, savory and unsavory, 'Moulin Rouge!' is the retelling of the famous 'Camille' story (a.k.a. 'La Boheme', a.k.a. 'Rent'). At the heart of the famous Moulin Rouge nightclub is the fabulous Satine, a courtesan of unbelievable beauty and renown, performed with lusty opulence by Nicole Kidman. Satine is being pursued by two men--a rich and worldly Duke, played by Richard Roxburgh, who all but twirls his moustache around his finger as evil epitomized; and by Christian, a naïve and penniless writer, played in a winning performance by Ewan McGregor, who instantly gains the audience's empathy with his large and expressive, aquatic eyes. Satine needs the financial backing that the Duke can provide to assist her in becoming a real actress, but falls in love with Christian, who captures her heart with his simplicity and his idealized concept of love. Early on the audience learns that Satine is consumptive, thus setting the stage for light farce transfiguring itself into rich tragedy. The costumes are wildly extravagant and gorgeous; the sets sensual and voluptuous--fantastical buildings and exquisite skylines that, at first glance, look as if they were conceived by a psychopathic drag queen on a hit of acid. But the backdrops are in themselves necessary characters to this eye filling production. The songs--most of which will be familiar to the MTV generation--are magnificently arranged and are given new meaning by their context in the movie; you will never hear them quite the same way again. McGregor's surprising vocal talent--at times a soft and delicate delivery, at other times surging and strong--gives new life to Elton John's 'This Is Your Song'. It is a scene as joyful and uplifting as watching Gene Kelly singing and dancing in street puddles in 'Singing in the Rain'. Kidman's voice is a bit thin and breathy, but she more than compensates for it with her astonishing abilities as an actor, and is delightful in the clever combination of 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend' and 'A Material Girl'. A Carmenesque, flamenco-stylized version of The Police's 'Roxanne' is dangerous and spine tingling. Perhaps the most outrageous treatment of our recent pop past is of Madonna's 'Like A Virgin'; it is reminiscent of the title scene from 'Hello Dolly!', hilariously overblown, complete with dancing and singing waiters. Like I said, this film isn't for everyone. Many will be put off by the apparent overacting of the cast, misunderstanding the intentional quality of melodrama that is inherent in the concept of the overall piece, and by its lavish cacophony which gives the film its carnival-like feel. It is, in the end, a beautifully realized, intentionally bohemian enactment of an oft-told bohemian tale--at its core is the movement's motto: 'Truth, Beauty, Freedom, Love.' Who could ask for anything more?  A triumph.",Moulin Rouge!

391,Nahret,Breathtaking. 10 of 10.,10,5 July 2002,"There are movies that are so good, they leave you speechless. With his unique perception of film making, Baz Luhrman makes you laugh and cry at almost the same time, and both will be genuine. This Spectacular, Spectacular movie is unlike anything I have ever experienced in a theater. It is an overwhelming, frantic, loud, deep and touching celebration of the Bohemian ideals: Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and, of course, most of all, Love. The approach to the story is distinctly Luhrman, who absolutely forbids us to forget that this is a movie (as in ""not real""), but who, at the same time, makes it impossible for us not to feel for his characters. This is accomplished on one hand because he tells us a story that, for all its sparkling surface, its garish colours and its hectic movement, is still a real story, with people in it that are so well drawn that they come alive. On the other hand, of course, the merit goes to the brilliant actors, one and all, who give breath and heart to their characters. Ewan MacGregor and, above all, Nicole Kidman, the Sparkling Diamond, draw us in and make us love them and love and suffer with them, to the very end.

The problem is that thismovie doesn't have the proper pacing.  Partly because of it'ssetting in the Paris Bohemian underworld, it is a constant rush ofimages through much of it that is just painful to watch andoverworks the senses to the point the brain isn't prepared to takein the finer points.  Watching through the first hour I was sotempted to just turn the film off as it hadn't pulled me in, somethinga good movie should accomplish in much less time.

393,AS-69,Probably the worst movie of the year.,3,19 November 2001,"""Moulin Rouge!"" tries to narrate its meager story via a sequence of (mock versions of) various well known pop songs. This technique is appearantly borrowed from the commercials. Whether it might work in a feature film is questionable, but worth a try. ""Moulin Rouge!"" is such a try and a complete failure. Its lack of style, content, and originality and the awful video clip style cutting which ruins the occasionally nice decors make it hardly watchable. In my opinion, two hours of watching MTV would have been a more rewarding experience. They would have offered better music and more change. The fact that this movie received so much attention is just another evidence of the continuing decline of major studio's film making.",Moulin Rouge!
394,stevenleadbetter,Film Of The Year?,8,7 November 2001,"It started and I was surprised, it was nothing like I was expecting. Ewan McGregor? Singing? This can't be right..Still, it appeared to be happening, whether my eyes believed it or not. Once you get used to the fact that it is set in the Moulin Rouge in 1899/1900 but they still appear to be singing Elton John and Police numbers, you can begin to enjoy the film itself. Don't let this fact put you off, the songs that have been chosen (and there are many) have been done with consummate care and attention and all work excellently well in a setting you would not expect them too. 'Like A Virgin' being quite marvelous in particular. McGregor plays an Englishman arriving in Paris in the Summer of 1899, to live life hedonistically with the Bohemians of the time. He writes a play to be performed at the Moulin Rouge by their resident cast, lead actress of which is Nicole Kidman, who actually glows in her role. She shows off her more than capable singing voice. Supported by an excellent all singing, all dancing cast of what appears to number hundreds. Some wonderful camera shots, a dramatic score that tingles on the back of your neck in parts and casting that would appear to be close to perfection, this is clearly (and by some margin) the best of the bunch thus far. Glorious, decadent, witty, fascinating and tragic. Absolutely delightful.",Moulin Rouge!

Unfortunately, my experience with Moulin Rouge was marred by the director and film editor. Flashing through different camera angles second by second in a herky-jerky fashion may work well for a short music video on MTV, but it had me feeling nauseous before this movie was half over. Not even Blair Witch Project gave me motion sickness like this. I would like to have seen the dancing with at least 5 seconds per camera angle because a lot of it looked like it may have been wonderful.

If it feels like none of the DVD extras and behind the scenes footage ever shows these people with their guard down, maybe it's because they're all so open-hearted on screen--there are some lovely images though, including costume fittings and makeup tests that look  like works of art in and of themselves (plus a lot of extra scenes that make one think Luhrman could've cut this film six or seven different ways).  Ewan McGregor gives a lovely, soaking wet performance as the strange, enchanted boy, Christian, and no one in recent cinema history has been quite so charming--and I don't mean a Tom Cruise-""Top Gun"" kind of charm.  McGregor is nothing short of winning in this role.  Together with Kidman--excellent screen chemistry and a virtuoso performance--they're the most memorable screen team in ages as they traverse the emotional rollercoaster Luhrman has set out for them. All this plus Jim Broadbent in the scene-stealing role of Zigler and Luhrman's sheer genius (who else could turn The Police's Roxanne into a heart-stopping dance spectacle?).  Deserved much better than it got at the Oscars but who cares about them anyway?  By the third viewing you'll be hearing Elton John's Your Song very much the way it must've sounded in Luhrman's head.

402,yaseminturkish,Wishing I'd seen Freddy Got Fingered instead,1,15 April 2002,"It is very suspicious situation when a director's last two movies are virtually stolen from the creative genius of others as Baz Luhrmann's Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and now Moulin Rouge can attest to.  That said, Moulin Rouge was the type of theater experience in which your literally dying to go home and read the 6000 page War and Peace, read the entire 20,000 page IRS tax book, or rent the bottom 100 of all time film Freddy Got Fingered.    Nicole Kidman was visibly embarrassed when her selected scene as Satine was shown at the Academy Awards.  And rightly so because the scene displayed exactly what she did throughout the entire Moulin Rouge debacle which was pant uncontrollably, fake orgasms, and lip synch songs that were better left behind to the forgettable 1980's.  I'm not sure I've ever seen an actress nominated in a lead role for using so little dialogue.  What an embarrasment to see Nicole Kidman contending with the likes of Halle Berry (she lifted Monster's Ball single-handedly to greatness) and Sissy Spacek (A difficult role for a gifted actress in In the Bedroom).  And a word of advice to Ewan McGregor-you were miscast here and you'd be wise to stick to better roles like the one you had in Trainspotting.  The most notorious thing I noticed in Moulin Rouge was how much I cringed in embarrassment for the gifted Jim Broadbent as a pimp daddy of sorts. This grandfather and Academy Award winner has always picked good roles (excellent British comedy shows, Bridget Jone's Diary, Iris) and why he relented to Baz Luhrmann I'll never know.  I can only surmise that he is desperately trying to pay the mortgage on his 15- million dollar brownstone and was forced to stoop to this level.  If only the relentless camera hadn't been so motivated to capture his oddly made-up face quite so closely.  Whoever signed off on virtually making a mockery of Kurt Cobain's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" better be prepared to hear it from Kurt in heaven.  I thought Madonna was smart enough to sell her songs to the highest bidder with some class, but she must have thought that Moulin Rouge reminded her of the good ole' days when she wore those pathetic cone bras and thought the world bowed only to her.    Moulin Rouge has an awfully high rating of 8.7 on the IMBD and I can only surmise that a bunch of little Brittany Spears-wannabe 10 year old's voted about a 100 times each.  Never has a film stolen so much from previous songs, previous movies, previous musicals, and called itself inventive and inspired.  The only thing inventive is the gold-digging scheme undertaken by Baz Luhrmann to produce and direct trash and market it as real art.  If you want to watch a film that reinvented the musical with a classic work (Romeo and Juliet) but original songs, go rent the amazing West Side Story (1961) starring the deceased but incredible Natalie Wood.  Not only is it a piece on race but it's a new idea.  And yes, it thankfully lacks a slowly turning red wind mill.",Moulin Rouge!
403,harsawa,"A strange, stylish, comedy-turned-romantic-tragedy. It's hard to put it into one genre, but as funny as it is sad, it's simply a must see.",10,9 January 2007,"When I first started Moulin Rouge! I felt like I was on a trip, in fact, I found it so incredibly off I didn't watch it. I couldn't watch it. Too strange. But then a friend of mine convinced me to give it another try, which I did, and I don't regret it. Moulin Rouge! is a hard movie to place, it's hysterically off kilter, it's depressingly sad and emotional, it's musically sensational, and it's definitely different. It tells the story of Christian (Ewan McGregor) a young poet and writer who has come to Paris in search of a job, against his fathers wishes, who warns him that he'll end up wasting his time with a Cancan dancer at the Moulin Rouge, and that there is no such thing as 'freedom, beauty, truth, and above all things, Love.' Which is something that Christian believes in more than anything else. So then,an unconscious Argentinian falls through his roof, along with an artist named Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) (A real person, so I've heard) and herd of other rather eccentric people, trying to find a good song for their next production (Christian comes up with 'The Hills are Alive') and is then whisked away to the Moulin Rouge, an enormous night club owned by eccentric Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the main attraction being his 'Diamond Dogs'. One of his star women, Satine(Nicole Kidman), wows the stage, and is to have a private meeting with a Duke shortly after her act. Well, Christian and Toulouse have already ran into the Duke, and when Zidler points out the duke to Satine, she does not see the Duke, but rather Christian, who instead shows up at the private meeting. Sound weird enough to you? It's even weirder to see. All the music in the movie is great, but if it seems familiar, that's because all but one song (The gorgeous 'Come What May')are remixes of classic rock and stage play songs. It still sounds unique and it all matches the on screen looniness. All though it's established that Moulin Rouge! is a weird movie, it's also a very sad movie. Each character has their own unique charm, and the silliness doesn't totally leave the movie, it stays consistent, but it of course, had to be toned down to make way for the more emotional, and serious main act, which will leave you in tears. I admit, the scenes leading up to the saddest part of the movie do seem unfitting as the end is a hard blow out of a rather exciting scene, but it's clear that the comedic part has made it's end, and it's time for the main act to deal out it's sad story. The movie does what a lot can't: It provides two different stories, that remain consistent with one another. The comedy act almost always hits, with you snickering or even laughing out loud at the overall craziness of the characters, but then the romance act sneaks in, and it's genuine and true, and in some points, even does a collaborative dance with the comedy act, but the romance ends in Tragedy, which severs it's ties with the comedy, though it never loses step. It's a wonderful movie, it's funny, it's sad, it's weird, and I would recommend this movie to anyone.",Moulin Rouge!
404,kdryan,A 'Road to Wellville' for the new century,7,10 June 2001,"If it weren't for Nicole Kidman looking more beautiful than any person ever has in any movie ever and what's his name singing 'Your Song', this movie would have gotten a 1 instead of the 2 that it did get.  It is so 'out there' that it is almost incomprehensible.  The acting is bad.  Yes, I understand is is arty to use modern songs in a past era, but there is a point and I don't think Kurt Cobain would much approve of using 'Smells like Teen Spirit' as part of (basically) a vaudeville act.  On a good note, the hidden references to modern songs are many and there is much that is amusing about the way they are used, but it does NOT make up for what is overall an attempt to get into the Guiness book of records for the most surrealistic picture ever.  I think that 'The Road to Welville' might have actually been better.  At least I sat through the whole picture.  But then, I was younger then so...BTW, I'm not kidding about the Nicole Kidman thing.  Incredible!!",Moulin Rouge!
405,vivalarsx,Theatrics: Plus and Minus,1,10 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge is nothing if not theatrical. Director Baz Luhrmann has a distinct vision that one would recognize even if his name weren't in the credits; his pursuit of all things artificial is evident. But here, unlike Strictly Ballroom and William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, his dogged pursuit of a kind of Zen-like cleverness fails. Moulin Rouge isn't a bad movie, exactly. Artifice and over-the-top hysteria have their place, and can make for a quite entertaining, sometimes thrilling, experience. But if you are aiming for the stratosphere with your artistic vision, by all means don't let it ever touch the ground. When Moulin Rouge is just being theatrically silly for its own sake, it soars; but Luhrmann is using every false device ever invented in the service of a story that was probably hoary in 1899, when this film takes place. His theatricality not only overwhelms the emaciated plot, but it doubly points out--again and again--just how hackneyed the storyline is. These are archetypes, not characters; these are plot devices, not drama. I wanted to like this movie, I really did; at times it was so much clever fun (the ""Roxanne"" tango number, for instance) that I was transported. But its weaknesses can't help but seep in and pretty soon Moulin Rouge is nothing but a remote, chilly experience. When Luhrmann sets all his machines in motion toward the end, one is simply repelled by his lunatic manipulations. How can one feel any emotion (and, boy, is it laid on thick like gravy) for (non)characters for whom the movie's theatrics have made empathetic involvement impossible? As my friend and I were riding in the parking garage elevator after the movie trying to sort out our feelings for the movie, two women got on having the exact same conversation. ""Oh, good"" I said, honestly relieved, ""it wasn't just me."" We all stepped out of the elevator and stood and talked for several minutes trying to sort it all out. That is certainly a sign of a director's accomplishing something, but it doesn't necessarily mean the accomplishment was good.",Moulin Rouge!
406,jn1356-1,If for no other reason...,9,28 November 2013,"You should see this movie for the beauty of Nicole Kidman, if for no other reason. I think her supernatural beauty reached its unprecedented peak in this movie. Her first appearance, a close-up of her face, is the most breathtaking show of female beauty since the violent eye of Elizabeth Taylor shocked us in the beginning of ""The Taming of the Shrew"".You should see this movie for Jim Broadbent, if for no other reason. It is embarrassing to have to admit it, but I had no idea what this amazing actor could do until I saw this. I had seen him in ""Bridget Jones"", where he is spectacularly underused. I had seen him in ""Iris"", where he is heartbreakingly brilliant. Later, I would see him in the Harry Potter series, where, like all the other actors of note, he got paid for doing tragically little. He, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, and on and on, lent their names, got well paid, and did little more than propping up younger actors. Broadbent sings, he mugs, he dances, he is hilarious, he is farcical, he is cynical, he is tragic. He is a one-man acting army in this.You should see this movie for Ewan McGregor, if for no other reason. He's almost as pretty as Nicole. But who knew he could sing? And sing he does, wonderfully. And he will make you cry.You should see this movie for the music, if for no other reason. Baz Lurhmann's cheerful anachronisms are hilarious and wonderful, starting with ""The Sound of Music"", going through a stellar medley of '60's hits, highlighted with Elton John's ""Your Song"", and reaching a farcical peak with a dance number to ""Like a Virgin"" which will leave you in pain with laughter. Listen for a grand operatic rendition of Sting's ""Roxanne"", which will knock your socks off!

408,pgear83,The Show Must Go On,10,30 May 2008,"Early in 2001, Australian auteur Baz Luhrmann followed up his modern adaptation of Romeo & Juliet with an even greater cinematic accomplishment. Moulin Rouge is set at the end of the 19th Century in 1899 (the 'summer of love'). The writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) sits at his typewriter in a grungy Paris loft, typing out the story of the life and death of his love Satine (Nicole Kidman). Thus from the very beginning we pretty well know where the story is going but how we get there is really something else.Moulin Rouge is what's known as a 'jukebox musical.' It takes a selection of well-known popular songs and alters them (musically and lyrically) just enough to fit the story as needed. In this film, the purpose of this is two-fold. First the pop-songs communicate the foreign and dated culture that is portrayed in a way that the audience can understand. In the early dance hall scenes, we hear not gaudy horns, but the songs of Madonna, Nirvana and Patti Labelle, among others - the idea being that our reaction to them should be similar what the Frenchmen would have felt upon hearing the dance hall music of THEIR time. Second, the protagonist Christian is established as an incredible poet, as he has the ability to instantly spin off the greatest poetry of the 20th Century (in a time before it was ever actually written, of course). Thus he helps the dwarf Toulouse-Lautrec and a narcoleptic Argentinean write their modern Bohemian play 'Spectacular Spectacular' and then, at the Moulin Rouge, woos Satine with his rendition of Elton John's 'Your Song.' However, Satine has been promised to an evil English Duke, in exchange for funding for the Moulin Rouge. The Duke catches Satine with Christian, but they swiftly explain that they are rehearsing a play, the plot of which exactly mirrors what is going on in their own lives.Which of the two Satine ends up with should come as no surprise. This is a film whose strength lies in style, not in unusual plot twists. The imagery is dazzling and often surreal; the music is densely layered and incredibly well harmonized. At times we hear up to four different pop-songs being played at once. The pace of the musical scenes is breakneck and there is likely more cutting than in any GOOD movie ever made. The film is also unapologetically silly at times, featuring cartoon-like motions and sound effects.Admittedly, the ending is kind of a downer. Not only is Satine dead of tuberculosis, as we have known from the beginning, but we are left with the impression that the time of those oft-mentioned Bohemian ideals of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love will soon be swept aside by the tides of war. In fact, one early version of the script had Christian telling his story, not from his typewriter, but while dying in the Fields of Flanders. That would have really been too much and was wisely changed.For outstanding (and Oscar-winning) costumes and art direction, a great ensemble performance and sheer frenetic energy, Mouling Rouge makes my top 10 list.",Moulin Rouge!
409,EJBaggaley,A show-off poser film,5,10 November 2004,"This is the kind of film that you may very much like when you first watch it, as one may get carried away with the bright lights, fancy costumes and model actors, but if you have any depth, whatsoever, you'll soon change your mind after you've seen this film at least twice and realise that beyond the colourful, superficial glamorous surface of this film, that it is nothing but a load of shallow nonsense. Although this film had spectacular lighting, good choreography and most of all, great talented acting, this film had no proper storyline. Although, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were the perfect people to act in this film, as they are both incredibly talented actors (ie.Singing and Dancing) I found this film completely fake and hollow. The reason why some people may enjoy this film is because they have mistaken this film for what they believe is sophisticated culture, but in actual fact, isn't. In my opinion, this film is a hyped-up, over rated chick-flick, and if thats your type of film, than watch it, if not, don't bother.",Moulin Rouge!
410,jmarcel,One of the best films of 2001,9,19 December 2001,"Moulin Rouge surprised me. I'm sorry I missed it in the theaters. Outstanding visuals, hip soundtrack and great performances by Nicole and Ewan make this movie a must see. As a musical, this movie plays like a live action bugs bunny cartoon complete with outrageous comedy bits and dazzling visuals. If you liked O Brother!, you will most likely enjoy Moulin Rouge. Don't go in expecting Evita. Expect lots of fast camerawork, incredible sets, great special effects, and a contemporary songlist and you'll be set to take in this wild adventure.",Moulin Rouge!
411,Kiwi-7,"A circus blend of Shakespearean comedy, Cabaret, and Romeo & Juliet",7,30 May 2001,"This film has plenty of pizzazz, dash and spectacle with fabulous costumes, eccentric characters, dizzying camera movement, and a curiously surreal, circus-like Paris.  It's also a funny, fresh look at the tragic love story -- and only with Baz Luhrmann at the helm could that not be a contradiction.This is a musical, first of all, and that will alienate some potential movie-goers.  The characters burst into extravagant musical numbers (my favorites were the Roxanne tango--WOW--and the comic ""Like a Virgin"" number) at the drop of a hat, and any smidgen of realism is non-existent.  That said, however, the love story between Christian (Ewan McGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman) carries a surprising ring of truth.  McGregor's natty smile (reminds me a little of Hugh Grant, but I reckon McGregor brings it off in a less corny way) and Kidman's melting response just work a treat.Story-wise, this one is very Shakespearean with all sorts of mix-ups and confusions and plenty of bizarre side-characters with wonderful cameo roles. You feel like the cast had a lot of fun making this film, and you're let in on some of the jokes, which is very neat.That all said, I still wasn't as pulled into this film as I have been with others.  It was fun and I wasn't bored, but I wasn't much moved  either, and at the end I have to give this film a firm thumb up, but not two thumbs.",Moulin Rouge!
412,49235781,Absolute Eye Candy!,10,12 June 2001,"There is no word to describe the thrill ride which takes each and every person in the theatre on their journey to the Moulin Rouge.Its practically impossible to talk of this film without discussing the score.  Its fantastically choreographed, superbly timed, a spectacle which wows and delights the senses.The story is very basic, but that's not the point.  Moulin Rouge is operatic yet contemporary at the same time.  There's a difference between a ""paint-by-numbers"" and ""traditional"" story... and what sets the two apart is the flare, glamour and sheer energy with which the story of Moulin Rouge is told.This film is not for the faint of heart -- if you enjoy roller coaster rides, stunning visuals, and absolute art on film, Moulin Rouge is for you. The tounge-in-cheek treatment of the film's music may be pure cheese for some, but it works in the film, and you must take it at its campy, loud, boistourous, and rather flamboyant face value to ""get"" whats going on at the Moulin Rouge.Enjoy the film... laugh, cry, breathe.  You'll be glad you did.",Moulin Rouge!
413,snakejenkins,A True 10!!!,10,8 June 2001,"Simply one of the best films I've ever seen. With that said, here's the review.  Honestly I don't know what to say.  I have never seen a movie like this.  I have never had an experience quite the same.  What a rush of exhilaration.  What a beautiful story.  I have seen many, many, musicals and this takes precedence in its ability to energize and captivate.There is an immediate level of unbelievablility to the entire film as it is presented in an extremely artistic fashion.  But after 15 or so minutes you will sit back and be drawn into its world.  Quick cuts and bizarre camera moves make the film an assault on your senses.  One of the great bits of Moulin Rouge was its ability to tell this wonderful story in a different and fresh way.  A small note on Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.  Both of them sing, both of them dance, and both of them ignite the screen and Ewan solidifies his place in my heart as one of the best actors on the scene. I cannot put into words the beauty of this film and its light-handed approach to the genre of musicals.  I heard another review which stated ""Your heart will sing,"" and that is exactly what mine did.",Moulin Rouge!
414,mafster,A Remarkable Experience,10,7 August 2004,"When I went to the cinema with my partner to watch Moulin Rouge, I was not looking forward to it.  To me it started off really weird and was tempted to leave within ten mins. but then the music kicked in and BAM! i was hooked. 
The music was sensational.  Some of them were mixed with different love songs and strolled along beautifully.  The more upbeat songs had the feet tapping to the beats.The movie was well coordinated with colour.  It managed to set the right mood levels from glamour to sad scenes.  Truly remarkable.The acting was of the highest calibre and some actually song the songs which helped blend then film together.  It also had it's sad moments and it is advised to take some tissues in with you for the tearful persons.Owning this now on DVD, it has been played more than average and rightly so. A truly wonderful experience and a great musical which will live long in the history of cinema.",Moulin Rouge!
415,Wolfi-10,opera for people who are bored by operas,10,9 April 2003,"After I was glued to the screen for two solid hours and then, listening to the closing music, even watched the credits for ten minutes (which has not happened in years), I returned to reality knowing that I had just seen a fascinating movie. Upon further reflection, it occurred to me that Moulin Rouge is really a opera; but a opera distinguished by not being boring for even one single minute. It seems that no scene lasts longer than ten seconds, there is continuing movement, there are people, colors, close-ups, all in breath-taking succession and accompanied by that gripping music. The credits say the movie was shot in Australia - if this is the Aussie style of film making, we sure want to see more of it.",Moulin Rouge!
416,dbn3,It's Greatness Crept Up On Me (9/10),8,21 February 2002,"(I saw this on DVD, YMMV)I haven't seen Luhrmann's other big film, Romeo+Juliet, nor did I know anything about the film when I rented it.  All I had heard is that it was a musical, a bit odd, and nominated for some Oscars.Christian is a writer who gets drafted to write a play called Spectacular, Spectacular! when Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (who is an actor, not a painter in this film) crashes through the ceiling with another actor practicing in the upstairs flat.  Once the idea for the play is begun, the group of actors visit the Moulin Rouge to sell the play to the owner, Harold Zidler.  There they meet Satine, a young dancer and prostitute that dreams of becoming a ""real"" actress someday.  Here chance appears when the Duke of Monroth offers to finance Spectacular, Spectacular in return for Satine's services.The hook here is this movie is a musical.  Not a typical musical, the songs here take lines and melodies from many different songs to create new ideas. The two pieces that stand out were the opening intro of the Moulin Rouge with the intro of Satine and the actors as they were waiting for Satine to save the play by acting her part for the Duke.The first had the women of the Moulin Rouge singing various lines from overtly sexual songs, with the men singing ""here we are now, entertain us"" from Nirvana.  Ripped clean from it's cynical, ironic underpinnings, the line creates something totally new - call it the John's Anthem.The second had Christian singing a song of love and jealousy while the actors danced the life of a prostitute to ""Roxanne"" sung in a low growl.As I watched, I was increasingly impressed with the technique and with the ability of Kidman and McGregor to not get lost in all the music, color, and quick cuts.  It was only at the end that I could look back and realize I had seen a great movie.",Moulin Rouge!
417,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,Beauty. Truth. Freedom. Love. It's all there.,9,29 September 2001,"It could have so easily gone wrong, this film. Musicals aren't made anymore for a reason. That reason is many people, like me, feel they're kind of silly. People don't dance to settle arguments, they don't break into singing just because they're happy and even when they do they're usually so drunk you can't understand a word they're 'singing'. And before you disagree, just think of that ill-conceived Titanic musical (for krissake). But that's not the only reason this could have gone very, very wrong. Having actors sing is about as good an idea as having singers act, especially considering Ewan McGregor's casting (anyone remember A Life Less Ordinary's sing-and-dance routine?). And then there's a completely unhinged madman director like Baz Luhrman. It could indeed have been awful. What it is however, is the most innovative, spectacular, gripping and beautiful film this year.Luhrmann continues what he had already done in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, which is combining the commercial (using modern music and a surprisingly heavy dose of comedy) with the artistic (the heavily theatrical stylings and loaded emotional content). Moulin Rouge! (it really deserves the exclamation mark) is most definitely a pop-opera. Technically, this is the crossbreed between unhinged and brilliant. With CG-rollercoaster shots through Paris, amazing production design and about as much edits you can fit into a two-hour film without driving your audience fully insane this is a visual feast every second of its running time. Even topnotch stylists like Ridley Scott don't come close.Sound however is not forgotten (it is a real musical, you know). Luhrmann uses many different types of music and has everything from Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend to Material Girl to Smells Like Teen Spirit to FatBoy Slim's loose interpretation of the cancan thrown into the first 15 minutes or so. Of course, they're all reworkings of the original songs, but they're both so recognisable and different I doubt any fans of the originals have a right to be insulted. With such a wide variety of music, the movie's bound to have both high- and lowlights, my personal favourite being a tango-like version of Roxanne. I don't really dislike a single song, although I could have done without one of the film's many love ballads by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. Not that's it's their fault, really. McGregor shows himself a talented singer and Kidman is truly spectacular. The same goes for their acting. Jim Broadbent is fine but I did think John Leguizamo could have been better. Special kudos go to Richard Roxburgh, who is absolutely hilarious as the movie's villainous Duke.So, with so much madly OTT style it really can't be expected to have any substance, right? Wrong. Moulin Rouge! may be more of  triumph of moviemaking than it is of screenwriting, it's definitely not as empty as certain critics would have you believe. It's basic premise is simple enough (it simply combines most great old plays about beauty, truth, freedom and above all love) but it's filled with emotions that seem cliches but are brought with such compelling honestly you can't help (or at least I couldn't, which, for someone who usually prefers cynicism above optimism and intelligence above emotion, is quite surprising) but be swept away be it. No, it won't exactly keep you talking about the relationship between art and real-life as portrayed so vividly on screen. In fact, I doubt it will keep you talking at all, but Moulin Rouge! is a film to experience, not to dissect.In short, Moulin Rouge! is a one of those once-a-year type films, which re-establishes your faith in the belief that Hollywood money can be used to create something utterly unique and astoundingly beautiful. The kind of film you hope won't be insulted by the Academy (but you know probably will).Rating: 9/10",Moulin Rouge!
418,xawn,Spetacular,10,31 October 2001,"This is a real gem. I never knew these two could sing so well! A rare work of art.This is a definite for those who love musicals.

Only funny the first ten minutes, if you don't get a headache because of all the effects that are thrown at you at an insane tempo.

420,suicidalicecreamtruckdriver,Australian cinema at its BEST,10,20 June 2009,"This is my favourite Australian movie, for numerous reasons. The beautiful set, costumes and amazing cinematography and direction made by Baz Lurahamn and it is well acted. Most movies have a great start but slags onwards with a lazy finale. This is different: and proves that all you need is love. From the fantastic songs 'Roxanne' and many more, this movie is amazing in it's own way. It's original and I'm happy to call myself Australian after watching this. The dances are very well done and I cried when Satine died. The evil duke is traditional as the villain, and this film defines what love is. It's got an amazing soundtrack as well and anyone can enjoy it. Nicole Kidman is perfect as Satine, and Ewan McGregor makes Christian a better partner than Jack ever was to Rose. I preferred it over Titanic, because this movie was very impressive in a much shorter budget. This is must- see cinema, with great characters and emotional factors drawn into it to create a masterpiece",Moulin Rouge!
421,bzb2001,Stunning beauty but thin in substance,5,23 December 2004,"""Beautiful"" is a word to describe Moulin Rouge. It is terrific sounding, decadent, full of splendor, and ... well ... obnoxious.It is a polarizing film, either fresh and exciting or clichéd and overblown. So I find myself at odds because I am rating this film a 5 on the IMDb scale. That's right, directly in the middle. It is a simple matter of mathematics. The story is probably a 3 or 4 but the music and staging is so breathtaking, it lifts the film up to at least mediocrity.The plot is simply told. Above all else it is a love story told from the point of view of a Bohemian writer who is in love with a Moulin Rouge dancer/singer/whatever. There you have the flaw. With a love story such as this you have to feel the connection between the characters, above all you have to feel love.Moulin Rouge's characters seem like actors playing their parts, with the possible exception of Ewan McGregor who seemed more and more genuine as the film progressed. Nicole Kidman received praise for her portrayal of the tormented prostitute who must choose between love or sensibility. I found her performance elegant looking and sounding but without much depth or feeling.The production is as much a character as the actors. The musical numbers run from stunning beauty (as when McGregor and Kidman perform ""Come What May"") to the inane (Jim Broadbent prancing around singing Madonna's ""Like a Virgin""). The entire movie was filmed on a soundstage in Australia and it has a sort of claustrophobic feel. But it also reminds me of images from a time well before my own when musicals were shot entirely on giant soundstages bursting with color and exploding with sound.Director Baz Luhrmann succeeds in making a film unlike any other. Perhaps that is a nod to the Bohemian brotherhood in the film's story. But if that were true, why not spend more time baking the story rather than marching on to the next schizophrenic eye-candy piece? The obsessive jump-cuts, maniacal characters, color washed sets, and extravagant costumes all yell out ""we're overblown and we know it!"" But isn't self-congratulatory vanity still just vanity? I wonder what the style of the film is attempting to say about the Bohemians, are they lashing out against average society's morals and taboos or are they just being different? **.5 out of ****",Moulin Rouge!
422,kingderella,"a great and unique artistic vision, but they completely blew the execution",6,30 March 2008,"moulin rouge! seems to be universally beloved, so i saw it with high expectations, but also with an open mind. i really wanted to like this movie. however, i was rather disappointed.i think i can see what they are trying to do here: the cinematic equivalent of a great pop song. simple in its content, glamorous in its presentation and honest in its emotion. its a great and daring artistic vision and certainly unlike anything I've seen so far. so it really pains me that they completely blew the execution.the biggest (but far from only) mistake is casting Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor as the leads. neither of them can sing, which is fatal in a love story in which the lovers express their feelings by bursting into song. furthermore, they lack chemistry and utterly fail to convince in their roles. Kidman spends the first half of the movie squeaking hysterically and the second half being the passive observer of her own fate; McGregor is styled as if he was a member of the Backstreet Boys.but there are so many other things that bothered me. the comedy parts are so over the top that they are more annoying than funny. the voice-over narration is just lazy. and i know in a movie like this the story is not really important, but still, it wouldn't have hurt to have a slightly less idiotic plot.the selection of songs is a mixed bag: Patti Labelles ""lady marmalade"" and the polices ""Roxanne"" are a given, and there are flashes of brilliance (eg. Nirvanas ""smells like teen spirit"", Madonnas ""material girl""). but ""the sound of music"" and ""rhythm of the night""? ""up where we belong""? really? and for a film that relies so heavily on its production design, Moulin Rouge! is remarkably tasteless, even for a film that embraces kitsch. (check out Sofia Coppolas ""Marie Antoinette"", François Ozons ""8 Femmes"" or Todd Haynes' ""velvet goldmine"" to see how these things should be done.)if seen with lesser expectations, Moulin Rouge! is still an enjoyable rush with an admirable artistic vision buried somewhere underneath its many flaws. its certainly courageous and unique, and it will probably be even more hilarious to see it in ten or twenty years. but really, i don't understand why it was so successful.",Moulin Rouge!
423,Edd-N-Furter,Love is a many-splendored thing... this movie too,10,12 April 2010,"Christian is a young poet who arrives to Paris in 1899, the summer of love to be part of the bohemian revolution that's happening. With some luck and the help from a group of bohemians that includes Toulouse-Lautrec he ends up being the main writer of the most ambitious show that's about to be presented in the Moulin Rouge (the most famous night club of its time). What he doesn't know is that he would find true love personified in Satine, the star courtesan and aspiring actress.However, things won't be easy once Christian and Satine are together: a jealous Duke who wants Satine only for him (who also happens to be the main investor in the show), Harold Zidler's refusal to the relationship (mostly because of the fear of losing the Duke's sponsorship) and a fatal disease condemn their destiny as lovers.The plot described above easily sounds taken from any conventional romance novel and could have been an average period piece. In Baz Luhrmann's particular vision it becomes a completely bizarre and indescribable experience. Why? Luhrmann takes the risk of using a forgotten movie genre: the musical and with some of the most emblematic pop songs of the 90's creates what he calls a ""real artificiality"" in which anything is possible. Or where else is possible to witness a very unusual rendition of Like a virgin sung by Jim Broadbent? or Ewan Mcgregor singing' Elton John's Your Song? Another risk Lhurmann takes is hiring actors that aren't exactly known for being gifted singers. Nonetheless the risk works and Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent and the rest of the cast prove to have stunning voices. In addition to that, they also deliver powerful performances that reach a very wide field of emotions, from the most absolute absurd to the most heartbreaking tragedy being completely believable.A very important element for Luhrmann's vision to be complete is the recreation of the 1899 Paris. Luhrmann and his team decide not to do a carbon copy of the Moulin Rouge and its elements and instead they create a whole new Moulin Rouge based on how new audiences would imagine it if it had been existed in this time. Also the costume design has an important role here, every gown and dress has own life and differentiates this movie from others.Also the choreography of the musical numbers are completely breathtaking and remind us every moment we're not watching a typical musical movie. And that's Luhrmann's main intention: to create a completely different movie that becomes an experience for the audiences. Many people won't agree with this point of view, but those who agree are grateful for a many-splendored thing like Moulin Rouge!",Moulin Rouge!

I should say that I hated the music (both in its origibnal form and in the movie), but what I disliked even more is the total mindless use of one-liners in the conversations.

426,sylvesterthekat,I loved this extraordinary musical extravaganza!,9,19 May 2001,"This has to be one of the most original films I've seen in a loooooong time. The visuals are stunning, the stages are sumptuously detailed, especially in the production around which the film rotates (the Spectacular Spectacular).
The use of modern (spectrum from the last 25 yrs or so) pop music in a 1900's Paris setting drew a big and favourable reaction from the audience with whom I saw the movie. The songs were presented in a sort of melange where one segued into another in an often hilarious way (it made one realise just how many songs about love there are out there), also using snippets of familiar songs to deal with the broad spectrum of human experience. And this movie doesn't spare us any of the harsh realities of life. In this way it is blessedly and most assuredly not a Hollywood production. Probably the best humorous effect was brought about by having two older guys singing Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' to each other. Has to be seen to be believed really.Make no mistake; this film is totally nuts but you will never forget it. The standard of singing was outstanding, especially from Nicole and Ewan who did an awesome job of it. I was rather skeptical that they'd be able to carry it off but oh my!

428,clarason-1,Beautiful Movie,10,15 December 2003,"This film also has a great sense of humor, with green fairies, funny uses of familiar pop music, and lots of love & emotion.It is extremely beautiful as well as tragic.   I never thought I would hear an Elton John song again in a movie and they did the song better than Elton John did it himself.  (Makes you wonder if Elton John ruined other songs of his by insisting he sing them himself.)But anyway this is my second FAVORITE movie of all time.  My first being Betty Blue (37°2 le matin) which isn't out on DVD yet.Anywho this is a love story set in France at the Moulin Rouge, an infamous French dance hall (which was the first building in the world to have had electricity).  It is an amazing story in itself to read about the Moulin Rouge and Toulouse-Latrec a french nobleman with birth defects who hung out at the Moulin Rouge quite a bit despite his fathers wishes.  Toulouse-Latrec is known for his artistic posters, which he mostly drew at the Moulin Rouge. It almost seems as if the whole story is just a dream of Toulouse-Latrec's.The Moulin Rouge is the home of Satine (played by Nicole Kidman) who is a ""consort"".  The young writer falls in love with her despite her profession and she falls in love with him despite the fact that he is broke.  They have a ""forbidden"" love because of several factors and try unsuccessfully to escape their lives, to make a new life together.The scenery is all at the Moulin Rouge mostly and it is beautiful.  There were also quite a few supporting actors and actresses who did a very good job.  The costumes made this movie.  I think without the sets and costumes this movie would NOT have been as good as it was.  It seems to me that instead of heaping ALL the awards on Buz Luhrmann, they should have been heaping awards on his wife, who did the set!   Also John Leguizamo was wonderful as Latrec, without Latrec this movie would be nothing.  Nicole Kidman makes a convincing prostitute, because she is kind of cold and distant, as you would imagine a prostitute would be.  And of course Ewan McGregor is really versatile and could probably play any part you gave him.  There was some real chemistry going on with Satine and Ewan, possibly enough so that it broke up Nicole's marriage to Tom Cruise, who she is better of without anyway.",Moulin Rouge!
429,enthusiast,Great movie!,9,19 January 2002,"Saw the movie on DVD, and thought it was great!

430,seanahalpin,Ho Hum,4,18 February 2002,"First, let me say that I am Australian, love Australian movies, and admire the daring, new and exciting.Moulin Rouge delivers on some levels: The costuming is sumptuous There are witty gags through the music (especially loved the Like a Virgin scene) The acting is generally quite good Nicole Kidman is perfect for the role (I usually am not a fan of Nicole...)BUTI thought that the avant garde film making was hampered by a thin plot and weak dialogue. Come on, people, any film with the line, ""You MUST sleep with the Duke"" lacks sophistication. The underlying love story, though sweet, was very run-of-the-mill and seemed to be incidental to the theatrics.Moulin Rouge has made a stir, but I suspect that it will become one of those films that people forget as newer and better films come along. To give it credit, it has broken new ground - but I thought Madonna and 'Evita' was more sophisticated.",Moulin Rouge!
431,saywardstudio,"unusual flick, that's for sure",7,9 February 2005,"I just saw Moulin Rouge for the first time...yes, I am a bit slow getting around to watch the films. Anyway, this one was hard to categorized for me. I liked it but at the same time I didn't. The costumes and colors are very awesome. The plot seems to run a bit fast and if you don't pay close attention you will miss something, although the actual plot is not that hard to follow(Duke wants girl, girl wants penniless artist/writer,Duke gets insanely jealous but doesn't win in the end.) I had seen some ads for it years ago when it first opened up, but as I said before never got around to seeing it. I thought, well, Toulouse Lautrec frequented Montmartre' and the Moulin Rouge, but surely they won't be so brazen as to put him in a fictional love story, conveniently titled M. R..... but there he is! Of course I have no idea if he was that 'hyper'?is that the word I'm looking for? or what in real life (I wasn't there! ;) ) but they portrayed him as being very annoying. First time I can honestly say Toulouse Lautrec has gotten on my nerves. I really thought it was clever the way Sutine was thinking the guy was not actually wanting to read poetry to her, but to make love to her, and she was getting all raunchy. That was slightly erotic and hilarious at the same time. The guys peeking around the corner was a bit...cheesy at best. Also, I liked the elephant. I'd have that, and live in it if I could. I guess this is what they call a musical, and I don't particularly care for musicals, I know it's just a show and they ARE entertaining, but it just seems, again, cheesy and almost incomprehensible when everyone knows the lines and can all sing in perfect key and they all just met. Another thing that drove me around the twist was splices of todays music in something that was set in 1899...what the..?? >opinionated!!!!< ;)I would say, if you have a couple hours to spend, go for it. Not a must see for me, but if you like bright colors, costumes and makeup, this is good. That's about all the enjoyment it was for me, and the over riding theme of Nothing matters but love, I'm a big IL' softy when it comes to that. :p So those parts were good.",Moulin Rouge!

Nicole Kidman is a surprisingly good singer, and thats the same to say about Ewan McGregor. They seem like an weird team when you first hear they'll be starring together, but they have awesome screen chemistry. The beginning makes it look like a weird Gothic-esquire depressing story, but it turns out to be a beautiful bittersweet love story. Kidman never ceases to amaze with her vocal range, and it's just plain amazing McGregor can even sing. Ewan McGregor is Obie Wan Kenobe, and you certainly wouldn't expect a Star Wars Jedi to be able to sing AND act. Bravo.

Well, then it should be no surprise that Moulin Rouge turned out the way it did and if you didn't like the way it was directed and edited, you should have known better from Luhrman's previous films.The best thing about Moulin Rouge was the hilarious highs and the heart-wrenching lows and all that brilliant colour in between.

And had the editing not been done as if cutting hair I might have been able to do so.  The quick/stop editing is sloppy work disguised as art.  This is the musical for the MTV Generation and for those who are unable to digest a story or film unless given to the audience in form of music video or commercials.  I got the feeling that the film's director thought he was being original, but the entire film borrows from so many sources that it could be the most unoriginal movie I've seen in years.  I did not like this film at all.",Moulin Rouge!
436,Bgb217,"If possible to describe it in one word, emotional roller-coaster. I loved it!",10,3 April 2002,"The only way to start this is to say just what I thought of Moulin Rouge, it was great. I only write comments here when I really feel that a movie is just so bad (ie Lord of the Rings) or when I love a movie so much (ie A Beautiful Mind). And I've been writing quite a few of these lately, and I noticed in my ones for Pay it Forward and A Beautiful Mind, which I did about a month ago I said ""best movie I've seen in a while"" because they were just that good. So is Moulin Rouge. This movie is just plain spectacular, spectacular, visually stunning, incredibly acted, and over all so good. Nicole Kidman is amazing as Satine, giving a mind blowing performance, I didn't think she had it in her, she was great in The Others... but wow. Ewan McGreggor also gave an incredible performance in the role of Christian, and again, for him too, I didn't know he had it in him. The story is very sad, but so good, but it isn't for people who aren't comfortable with love stories. Baz Luhrman's direction was incredible; new, hip, fresh, interesting, and dramatic. The whole film is just something to be taken in, a real work of art.  Now, if you haven't seen the movie maybe you shouldn't read this paragraph, ship it over, but maybe not. Because if is revealed in the first part of the movie that, she dies. I didn't think that this took away from the story as was what I heard a lot of, I thought it added to it, Christian says that Satine is dead, but he doesn't say how that happened, and all through the movie it was just, just, you have to see this is you haven't, see what you think of it.  Concluding, I loved Moulin Rouge, WOW acting, incredible directing, the sets and everything were just, there's no other word to use to describe it WOW, and a great story. That is above all things about love. If you haven't seen this great movie; do yourself a favor and go do.",Moulin Rouge!

The screen explodes with vibrant colors, song, dance, and of course, the gorgeous, talented and utterly unpredictable stunner NICOLE KIDMAN. This really looks like a labor of love for all involved and it is just pure escapism, the sort of film movies are made for. I agree with those who claim the story is simple, but it needs to be, because the screen is bursting with life and a complex story would just make things too difficult to grasp. This is a perfect picture, Nicole sings and dances beautifully and it deserves every accolade it has received and then some! Congratulations to all for a risk well worth taking! 10/10",Moulin Rouge!

439,Oreolove,The Greatest Thing You'll Ever Learn...,10,27 May 2002,"Is just to see this movie! This is perhaps one of the best movies I've ever seen. It starts out with scenes that make you feel like you're on drugs but soon turns into a wonderful story. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are superb as Satine and Christian, who become the Romeo and Juliet of France. Satine's a high class prostitute that mistakes Christian, a poor poet, for a Duke and makes him fall in love with her. Meanwhile, the real Duke obtains the deeds to the Moulin Rouge, an exciting night club, and demands that he own Satine while he is there. Zidler, Satine's pimp, orders her to end any feelings she has for Christian, in fear he will lose ownership of the Moulin Rouge. But the lovers will not be torn apart and all hell breaks loose until the final, tragic ending. This is a must-see movie filled with laughs, gasps, beautiful songs, and some intense dance numbers. (Watch for the ""Roxanne"" dance number, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.)I particularly like Christian's quotes: ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."" I was very sad to see that this won almost no Oscars, but I gave it a 10. Just remember: All you need is love! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Freedom~~Beauty~~Truth~~Love~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",Moulin Rouge!

I want to ask you one question, ""What's Wrong with you?"" It's a story about a love like none other, about two people that fall in love no matter the consequences. I loved Nicole Kidman as Satine, her voice gave me goose bumps. Ewan McGregor really surprised me. I never knew he could sing, and he was really good. All that I didn't like was the end, it was so tragic...I loved every minute of the Moulin Rouge! not once was I bored or even asleep.

441,Justin-62,One of the most spectacular films I have ever seen,10,10 June 2001,"Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor both have incredible voices (especially McGregor), the story is exhilerating, the costumes are breath-taking, the sets are lavish and spectacular, and the musical numbers will stick in you head for a long time to come.  And those aren't even the best parts of the movie.I was initially very leary about Moulin Rouge, but about 45 minutes in I realized I was absolutely in love with the movie.Nicole Kidman is absolutely radiant on screen - and shows a wide range of acting ability.  Although I've had a thing for her since seeing Far And Away, Moulin Rouge takes it to another level.  Nicole Kidman is absolutely beautiful (pity Tom Cruise for letting her get away).The Elephant Love Medly and Like A Virgin musical numbers are nothing short of fantastic.I don't think I'm going out on a limb to say Moulin Rouge will receive Academy Award Nominations for Art Direction and Costumes.  Possibly for make-up and original song as well (Come What May or I'll Fly Away).I just hope the DVD is a director's cut with even more scenes - or at least a lot of behind the scenes stuff.",Moulin Rouge!
442,mattdvs,Great if a little bit shorter...,7,1 August 2001,"I was dragged to this movie by a girlfriend so, needless to say, I wasn't expecting much of anything.  While I enjoyed Baz Luhrman's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" I wasn't part of the masses of people that thought it was a towering achievement.  Before I saw MR, I heard they were using current pop songs (""Like a virgin,""""Roxanne"") in the soundtrack and was very skeptical. Well I must say is was much better than I expected, and just about all the pop songs fit very well, with the possible exception of ""Like a virgin,"" which was totally unnecessary.  I actually liked this film a lot, and was very happy that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang their own parts.  The visual style displayed is key, but not the only drawing point, and therefore works well within the context of the famous French nightclub.  My only complaint really was that it was about 20 minutes too long.  With a TRT of over 2 hours, the plot is just not thick enough to support this length, and therefore becomes a major detractor. 7/10",Moulin Rouge!

Everyone involved outdid themselves, especially the breathtaking Nicole Kidman as the tragic Satine and luscious Ewan McGregor as Christian.There are so many songs, so many dazzling camera angles, so many gorgeous costumes that it starts turning into a wild ride beyond the scope of heaven and even hell. It's truly the embodiment of a cinematic acid trip. Incredible. Outrageous. Unbelievable. Watch it!",Moulin Rouge!

I had no idea they could sing!The Choreography was fantastic- it looks pretty tiring!I feel Moulin Rouge should of won more oscars- i cannot stand Russel Crowe!

447,evilpinklolita,Massive Sensory Overload,1,4 January 2011,"This was one of the strangest films I have ever seen. For one thing, it seems like a weird role for Nicole Kidman to take, not her kind of thing at all. The movie was like a bad acid trip: too many sounds, too many blinding bright colors, and too much camera movement, all assaulting the senses simultaneously. The musical style was from the wrong era for the historical time of the film: too modern for it, so it clashed. It reminded me of the country music I frequently hear at the Chinese buffets in my city. Combine that with a lack of plot, and you have a hideous caricature that attempts to imitate a movie and fails. Very bizarre.",Moulin Rouge!
448,HollywoodVixen90,A Spectacular Spectacular Movie,10,28 March 2012,"Okay this movie has been on my personal top 10 list of my favorite movies of all time ever since I first saw it and fell in love with it when I was 11. I have always been a fan of musicals and to me this movie is the greatest musical of the 20 century. The music and dance numbers are beyond amazing!! I am so glad that they actually used the actors actual singing voices instead of having the lipsync to other people sing. Nicole Kidman was amazing as ""Satine"" the gorgeous star courtesan of ""The Moulin Rouge"". Nicole can sing very well, and she shows that off in this movie. Ewan McGregor did a great job as ""Christian"" the writer who falls in love with ""Satine"". Ewan also has an amazing voice as well. Jim Broadbent perfect for the role of Zidler!! He fits this role so well. Richard Roxburgh did a pretty good job playing the obsessed Duke. John Leguizamo was I think the perfect choice for Toulouse-Lautrec, I cannot think of anyone else playing Toulouse in this movie, it just wouldn't be the same. Jacek Koman is HILARIOUS as the ""Unconcious Argentinian"". I love the fact that Kylie Minogue had a cameo appearance in the movie as ""The Green Fairy"". Sorry for me going on and on about the actors I just believe this was one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a movie. Baz Luhrman did an amazing job with this movie and he has such a brilliant mind that I totally admire him. He is a bad-@ss director.I love this whole movie and all of the songs and dance sequences so it's hard for me to pick a favorite but I think my favorite of the whole movie was ""Hindi Sad Diamonds"". I love, love, love that sequence. I love the song and the choreography to the music was AMAZING!! Another one of my favorites is ""El Tango De Roxanne"". Jacek Koman can sing well. I love the raspy sound of his voice.I also LOVE the costumes and makeup in this film. They did a wonderful job in keeping the clothing to the time period and they made the clothes look fantastic at the same time s well.This is an AMAZING movie. This is a great, tragic love story about two people falling in love yet they have to keep their love a secret from others. This is one of the best movies ever in my opinion. If you haven't watched it, WATCH IT!! If you love musicals and love stories, I am 100% guaranteed you'll love this movie like I do. You'll find yourself falling in love with the characters, the songs, the dances, and the story.Freedom, Beauty, Truth, and Love!!!!!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
449,pensive_englishman,Beautiful from start to finish,10,11 June 2020,"Well, well, well, another quiet but beautiful night is spent by revisiting the classic Moulin Rouge. What a fantastic show it is! Dressed in the form of music drama, the movie portrays the stark difference between idealism and realism, and the tense conflict between materialism and spiritualism. It is truly and highly an emotional and heart wrenching episode. Cast by Hollywood superstars Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, the show was once an Oscar nomination and for many good reasons, will continue to be a sensation.
Interestingly enough, I find myself inadvertently a Kidman fan. I just happen to like a lot of her movies, Cold Mountain, The Hours, Australia, to name a few. She has a calm characteristic just like her fellow Australian actress Cate Blanchett.
I somehow feel it's such a beautiful and meaningful thing to spend a quiet night on a quality movie. Isn't it a good feeling to immerse yourself into the drama, free your mind, soul and spirit, and let your emotion pour, soar, roar or uproar with the episode?
Thank you the motion picture. You have indeed enriched many lives, one of which is mine.",Moulin Rouge!
450,Devans00,Wonderful Costumes and Sets but.....,4,24 December 2001,"I gave this movie a 4 out of 10.  It would have been lower, but the fantastic colors costumes, sets and animation saved Moulin Rouge from being a total loss.  The leads were definitely eye candy, but I didn't find them appealing beyond that.  The ""modern"" music tended to be jarring and killed the mood the dialog built up.  I thought the parts between the musical numbers tended to interrupt the flow, too.On the DVD, I the writers and other crew were more interesting to me than most of the main characters.I'd only recommend this movie if either like ""vanity"" movies (there was a lot of specialized lighting for the actors faces) or if you love excellent period costumes and set designs.",Moulin Rouge!
451,sundance14,Wonderful! Original! May yet be a classic despite a few flaws.,7,3 June 2001,"Anyone who follows my reviews knows that I reserve wonderful for truly rare cinema. Moulin Rouge is wonderful.I think I hear Fredrico Fellini saying ""Here! Here!"" out there in paradise. It seems almost fitting that the world lost such a genius as Fellini on Halloween, since his works were always events of the bazaar and often masking greater things. The writers of Moulin Rouge saw a few Fellini films, bet the farm on it.Anyway, except for one, the cast was splendid too. John Leguizino is a show stopper as his version of Toulouse Latrec. Evan McGregor as the love smitten Christian is very good too. Jim Broadbent is dazzling as Zidler. Ok to the ""el stinko"";..yep it is Ms.Kidman. Ok so she is pretty. Sunsets are pretty, even beautiful, but they are hardly sexual experts as courtesans are supposed to be. Nicole Kidman as ""Satine"" the courtesan, is rather like casting Ernie Borgnine as Lancelot, it wouldn't be a fit. She is not a fit. She is pretty and perhaps she can even act, who can say, but a courtesan she isn't.Hollywood is full of sexy young courtesans, pick any one of hundreds and put them in this role and you have a masterpiece. Anyway, go see this movie.  It is fun and it will make you laugh.",Moulin Rouge!
452,buckleym-1,A MTV type musical,5,24 February 2002,"Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge!"" explodes onto the screen. The camera starts off moving around never truly settling down on one particular person. The musical sequences (and there are many) play right to the MTV music video generation including many popular songs from the last 20 years sung by the characters. The editing, though, jars the viewer to the point of eye soreness. The story revolves around a writer (Ewan McGregor) and a performer (Nicole Kidman) who fall in love despite a few obstacles. The acting is very good, but this musical just feels a little too stylish and never lets you fully into its fantasy world. A 5 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!

The music, except for a couple of songs, was hardly tolerable (why, oh why didn't they take people who could sing?). The plot was as unoriginal as it could be - exactly like in the Moulin Rouge spectacle, it looks like it was improvised in less than a minute. The only good thing about this movie was Nicole Kidman, but even she couldn't save this disaster.Is it just me or does it seem like movie-goers worldwide are getting dumber and dumber day by day? or is it true that 12 year old girls took over IMDB? whatever it is, at least my friend enjoyed his 2 hour nap... 3/10",Moulin Rouge!
454,SFTVLGUY2,A Buffet for the Senses,10,13 February 2005,"The exclamation point following the title in ""Moulin Rouge!"" is justly deserved, but barely begins to convey the level of excitement achieved in this film. Viewers seem to be evenly divided into two camps (with no middle ground) - those who dismiss it as a loud, excessive exercise in over-the-top movie-making, and the rest - like myself - who embrace it for its style, its imagination, its movement, its passion. Like a three-ring circus, it presents an overabundance of frenetic action that's impossible to absorb in one sitting. If ever a film demanded multiple viewings in order to appreciate it fully, ""Moulin Rouge!"" is it.Screenwriters Craig Pearce and Buz Luhrmann - who also directed - previously teamed for ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Romeo + Juliet,"" both cult favorites in their own right. Here they have selected the famed Paris nightspot, synonymous with extravagant entertainment and unbridled debauchery, to serve as the backdrop for what is, in essence, a simple love story. At the turn of the century - 19th rolling over into 20th - Christian, a penniless poet, arrives in Paris determined to establish himself as a writer. At first glance he is mesmerized by Satine, an elegant courtesan and leading attraction at the Moulin Rouge, who wants nothing more than to be a ""real actress."" Duc de Monroth, more familiarly known as the Duke, appears to be the wealthy means by which she can fulfill her dream, but at a price higher than she may be willing to pay. She initially scoffs at the attentions of the young writer, reminding him he can ill afford her, but she finds the pure love he offers to be more attractive than the success she could find in the arms of the lecherous nobleman. Ultimately, she will have little say in her fate, as consumption slowly saps her strength and illness invades her fragile body.In fleshing out their tale, Pearce and Luhrmann have borrowed from a grab bag of eclectic storytelling traditions. Their script embraces the pathos of Puccini's grand operas, the cases of mistaken identity found in Shakespeare's comedies of errors, and turns to more contemporary influences such as the madcap adventures of the Marx Brothers, Lucy and Ethel's convoluted plotting, and the spectacle of Bollywood musicals. All of this is highlighted by a score of 20th Century music from talents as diverse as Rodgers and Hammerstein, Paul McCartney, Madonna, and the Pointer Sisters. Christian and Satine's duet of a medley of popular love songs on the roof of the nightclub is pure magic.Magic is the keyword here. Everything seems to have sprung from a giddily gaudy land of make-believe where anything can happen, and often does. Satine's first entrance at the Moulin Rouge is seen through the eyes of Christian and his newly-found cohorts, all of them mind-tripping after consuming absinthe, and the spectacle is a dazzling array of sound and color and feverish movement as the camera spins through the crowd to capture every corner of the room and every person inhabiting it. At their first meeting in Satine's dressing room, she mistakenly believes Christian's wish to recite poetry is an unusual prelude to sex, and she writhes and moans in a faked display of passion until he, totally perplexed, blurts out the opening lines of Elton John's ""Your Song."" What follows is an exquisite rendition of the song that takes them out the window and into the night sky of Paris, where they dance among the clouds and waltz around the top of the Eiffel Tower. The camera-work here and throughout is spectacular. Much credit is due the film editors and special effects team, as well, for their often dizzying but never dull contributions that keep the film in a state of perpetual motion, and to the costume and set designer and art director for filling every scene with a visual smörgåsbord to delight the senses.Nicole Kidman previously had proved her worth as an actress in the delicious ""To Die For,"" but here her performance as Satine establishes her as a full-fledged STAR. Finally fully dashing out of the shadows long cast on her by husband Tom Cruise, she illuminates the screen with both her beauty and unmistakable talents for comedy, drama, and music. As remarkable as she was in the following year's ""The Hours,"" her Academy Award-worthy performance is the one she offers here. Ewan McGregor is delightfully surprising as Christian, proving himself to be a charming romantic lead and a very capable singer. Kudos also to John Leguizamo, who endows the diminutive Henri Toulouse-Lautrec with a deep sadness hidden behind his live-for-life demeanor; Jim Broadbent, for his no-holds-barred portrayal of the heart and soul of the Moulin Rouge, the impresario for whom belief in true love ultimately overshadows a need for financial gain; and Richard Roxburgh, whose finely-etched performance of the Duke allows him to fumble his way through a myriad of emotions as his unrequited passion for Satine slowly evolves into a realization that he's been made the fool.I have found it impossible to convince those who failed to appreciate ""Moulin Rouge!"" to give it another chance, but those of us who have returned to it multiple times tend to discover a previously unnoticed bit of business as we try to keep pace with the frenetically moving camera. This is that rare film that grows richer with each viewing, one that set a standard to which all future movie musicals should be held.",Moulin Rouge!
455,jimpowellsf,One of very few movies I own,10,17 November 2011,"Even now, more than 10 years after this film was released it still captivates me. Ewan and Nicole both just shine in this film. I remember seeing this movie 9 times in the theaters, and have watched it at least twice that many times at home. It's wonderful escapist cinema. The love story, tension, music/score, characters, cinematography, humor, and more all make it for one of my all-time favorite films.I recently moved and put this on to test my home theater system. Once I started it, I couldn't stop it. It's been several years since I'd seen it from beginning to end, and I still think it holds up. Baz Luhrmann makes too few movies, if you ask me. If you've not seen this movie, give it a shot. Trust me, once you get past the first ten minutes (they're confusing and a bit of an odd start to a movie) you're stuck.",Moulin Rouge!

Moulin Rouge is an OPERA, a MUSICAL, a COMEDY, a DRAMA, oh let the list roll on and on and on. Moulin Rouge, it is my guess, will destroy the almost perfect Rocky Horror Picture Show, and bring something new to the midnight people. If not, oh well. If this movie doesn't get noticed for some award somewhere than there is no hope for mankind. I hate calling this a ""movie"", I think it's a film, because a film means something and isn't just slapped together in one night. This is ART, this is everything ART should be.

When the movie starts out with a young writer saying ""All one needs is to love, and be loved in return,"" you know you're in trouble. The Parisian sets looked fake, nothing like what Gladiator achieved by bringing ancient Rome to life. In fact, this whole movie seemed fake, contrite, and just not very well thought out.

It never completely pulled out of the jarring weirdness that made it so different. I personally wouldn't recommend it unless you're a big fan of one of the major stars. The music was the best part of the whole thing.It was also pretty depressing whenever you thought about the actual plot, and it never really pulled out of that.

460,CTS-1,"All Oversaturated Color, No Substance",1,4 August 2002,"How did this film ever become so acclaimed? Take a couple of stars, mailing it in, add oversaturated color backgrounds (possibly ripped off of the much-maligned ""200 Motels""), toss in a few bizarre minor characters and non-sequitur scenes (again, done 30 years ago in ""200 motels"" without the self- indulgent pompousness), regurgitate as many lame top-40 songs of the last 20 years as possible (wait, that isn't ripped off of ""200 Motels""- Frank Zappa made the effort to write new songs for his movie)- and, voila! A movie that is all obnoxious smoke and mirrors with no substance whatsoever.Baz Luhrmann is downright lazy- tossing back pop culture and lame comments about ""love"" without adding anything is profoundly unoriginal. At least when John Waters throws pop culture back at us, he has the creativity to put his unique satirical spin on it. Luhrmann just puts a couple of stars over his lazily produced dreck, tosses in a lot of color, and then throws it against the wall and sees if it sticks. What surprises me is that, for so many people, it did stick.",Moulin Rouge!

He gets involved with a production called Spectacular Spectacular, a truly Bohemain play about love conquering all else, but needs to get permission to write the play from Harold Zeigler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge. In order to do this, he must meet Satine, posing as a famous English writer and convince her to talk to Zeigler about him writing the production. When she mistakes him for a rich duke who's keen to invest, she seduces him and falls in love with him. They then embark on a beautiful love story, but this can only result in heartbreak...

It will take some critics and some audience members years to catch up. Baz Luhrmann and his fearlessly committed team -particular honors go to the costumes, production design, cinematography- have fashioned a film that's unlike any other (high praise!) and that deserves all the scattered raves it will also be reaping. And then of course there's the music. It's a dazzling and sometimes left field approach to a song score and it works so well... Total highlights? Jim Broadbent's hilarious ""Like A Virgin"", the ""Come What May"" Bollywood finale, and ""the Tango Roxanne."" I hope that moviegoers will open up their minds and hearts to this. We desperately need films that challenge us visually and aurally. We need films that arrive in messy confusing 'I-don't-know-quite-what-to-make-of-this' glory.

464,sherbear-2,For the people who hated it...... (Spoilers!!!!!!!),10,18 June 2002,"I have a suggestion for you.  Watch it again.  The first time I watched it, it was all I could do to sit through it until the end.  I too was disgraced at the anachronisms, especially musical.  Nothing was accurate to 1899 Paris.  Then when it ended, I thought to myself, ""I kind of understand what this is all about.""  So I rewound it and watched it again.  Since then I have seen it three more times.  It is my all-time favourite movie.  Watch it again and don't take it too seriously.  Realize that everything, accurate to 1899 Paris or not, is there to help tell the story of their love.  Allow yourself to laugh at the silly ""Like a Virgin"" dancers and be shocked when Christian yells, ""Because she doesn't love you!""  Forget that it's predictable and not historically correct.  Get lost in the story, music, and visual effects, and I promise, you will cry when Satine dies.",Moulin Rouge!

The acting is horrible, the lip-synching depressing, the script painfully bad, the music recycled hits gone wrong.... I kept on skipping from scene to scene, waiting each one out, hoping against hope that it would improve... nope, never did. This is the kind of film that causes me to question why humanity hasn't blown itself up yet.

466,john_murdoch2002,After a closer observation (and repeated viewings)...,10,1 January 2003,"...I finally found the method to this film's frentic madness. Before, I used to get overwhelmed and think that there was no true depth to this film and thought it was just an attempt for Baz Luhrmann to establish himself as a unique film-making style. Turns out, it's not in his pace of film-making, but in the style of his shots that seem to encompass a world in and of itself that sets him apart from flash in the pan directors like Michael Bay and McG.The film tells a heartbreaking tale of true love and how it transcends the boundaries of materialism and set standards. We have idealist Christian (Ewan McGreggor) who comes to Paris in 1899 to find his voice as a writer. As he meets a gala of colorful roommates who take him to the Moulin Rouge to pitch his play, he sees Satine, the crown jewel of the cabaret, and is instantly captivated by her. But unlike the other men who are put under her spell, Christian can see what Satine has hidden from everyone else and he falls in love with her. After Christian shows Satine that life (and love) can and does exist outside of the Moulin Rouge, they begin their love affair. But Satine is constantly dragged back into her world by The Duke who simply wants to buy her with material possessions.What the film has to say about love is that it can transcend any drudgery and elevate those whose hearts are filled with it. Even in the darkest of places where ""love is available to the highest bidder"" as one song suggests, if you truly love someone for who they are, then love can exist anywhere.Bax Luhrman creates a 17th-18th centuary like we've never seen, where the colors are vivid, the lighting has as many spotlights as it does shadows and the pace is more frentic than today's hustle and bustle. Though at times the songs and pace can seem out of place, it only helps to create one man's vision of the times. Luhrman's style may not be liked by many, but one cannot deny that it is his own.At first, I enjoyed Moulin Rouge, but then the pace grew so fast for me that I became exhausted with it and couldn't find the depth that I once saw in it. Then watching it again on DVD on my TV has shown me that this is the best way to watch this movie so as not to be overwhelmed by the the big screen, but seen in widescreen so the TV won't cut out every facet of this festival for the eyes and ears.Despite the ending, one can't help but feel grateful that love had existed, helped someone achieve their dream and give them the sense of freedom. And in doing that, Luhrman and company have truly embodied and modernized the Bohemian mantra of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love.",Moulin Rouge!

Can he make a musical movie without screwing up?...YES HE CAN CAN CAN! YES HE CAN CAN CAN! Moulin Rouge is the best musical movie I have ever seen in my 17years of existance here on Earth. This should be the number one musical ever instead of that West Side Story one. Nicole and Ewan did a wonderful job in this movie. Actually Ewan is my favourite actor and knowing that he's in this movie made me even more desperate to see this. Nicole Kidman is so sexy, no matter what her costume is, she is so hot! I really like the songs they put in this movie especially the *Elephant Medley* and *Come What May* The song with an Indian singer & Nicole for the last half is so cool. Every time I hear that song I feel like dancing! 'Cause this movie so good, I bought it on DVD. Buy or rent this movie people, this is the movie that will make you watch it over and over again.

470,snazel,Giddy Tapestry of Farce & Romanticism,7,2 February 2002,"Moulin Rouge is a tapestry of things borrowed and thrown together to produce some great fun. The film is a little bit Magic Flute, a little bit MTV, a little bit Cabaret and a little bit Monty Python.Moulin Rouge is giddy fun, right from the first scene, where ridiculously dressed dwarfs come crashing through the roof.If you are the least bit nihilistic in life, this movie will annoy you within ten minutes and have you thoroughly bitter after an hour. Sometimes I think this film was made to annoy the kind of people that hate musicals. If you hate musicals, frivolity and gaiety at all, this film is literally your worst nightmare.Mouline Rouge robs references anywhere it can find them and never apologizes for the plagiarism. Indeed it holds it up to you and demands you to laugh at it all. When a late 19th century love ballad, features copped lyrics from the group KISS, you know you've hit something wonderfully silly.Is this film great art? Most assuredly, just as chocolate ice cream is great food. This is a movie that will delight those with light hearts and discourage those with heavy souls, to the point where they'll become contemptuous of the film's success.Personally, I hope it wins Best Film of 2001. In a year filled with horror and fear, a film such as this, filled with such farcical spirit and tender song, is just the medicine we need.",Moulin Rouge!

Baz deliveries yet another gem for as to lavish as a cinema audience. The costumes are gorgeous, an array of vibrant colours for our eyes to feast upon.

472,Catscanfly,"Inspired, inspirational, cinematic Joy",10,24 February 2004,"this is probably one of my favourite movies of all time. that isn't to say that everyone will love it as I do, of course... It is definately the type of movie that divides people into two classes: those who absolutely love, cherish, and adore it, and those who absolutely loathe, hate and despise it. count me into the former.To me, Baz luhrmann (the visionary, slightly mad director behind Romeo + Juliet) has created one of the rarest, most precious and beautiful gems of cinema, ever. The performances (a fizzling, sparkling cinematic pairing of the ever wonderful Ewan Mcgregor, and the heartbreaking, beautiful Nicole Kidman being the central ones), the sets, the costumes, the story, the themes, the music, and everything else that makes up this movie is sumptuous to the senses, overflowing with colour, emotion, energy, beauty and power. Luhrmann, who wrote the screenplay himself, along with Craig Pierce, (with whom he had already collaborated with on both his previous movies, Romeo + Juliet, and Strictly Ballroom) has admitted himself, that the movie is not aiming to be ""psychologically thick"". rather, it is a surreal, emotional journey, beautifully scripted, that aims not for realism, but ""truth"" of feeling. full of little gems (The scene inwhich Christian comes up with the refrain ""the hills are alive with the sound of music"" is a lovely example)  and hundreds of truly show-stopping sequences, such as the incredibly intense ""El tango de roxanne"" scene, inwhich Christian's jealousy and anger towards his lover satine are brought to incredibly to the fore, through vigourous, erotic dancing, and swelling climax. Though this movie is notorious for it's MTV style quick cutting and fast paced, wild visuals and cinematography, I think it is infact not appreciated enough for what lends the film its heart and soul: the love story.The sequences set in the infamouse Moulin Rouge itself are, indeed, faced paced and exhilerating (perhaps to some, nauseating). however, Luhrmann steps up and down the pace of the camera. Even if at times it distracts some viewers with its restless, snappy cutting, it also becomes poetic and tender, if never quite stopping its' beautiously surreal movement and viewpoints. I've never been lifted higher out of my cinema seat than the joyeous scenes of the lovers duets ""The elephant love medley"" or ""come what may"". At points, the swelling emotion and magic is truly incredible, the emotional highs and lows the movie takes you on are truly amazing.This movie is a pulsating, touching, moving, funny, musical, tragic and wondrous work, that revolves around an age old theme: love, celebrating it and exciting all those whom it speaks, or perhaps sings to.",Moulin Rouge!
473,Aaron_West,Mad. Mad. Mad. Dazzlingly Mad.,7,26 May 2014,"Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge is one of the most divisive films of recent memory, thought visionary by some and stupid by others - and both by me. One thing is for sure though, Moulin Rouge is one of the maddest movies I have ever seen. The music, production design, and costumes make it ravishing if not ironically uneasy on the eyes. The direction could do with a bit of polishing, I would have liked much longer and more fluid takes for example, to take in the wonder that the film was visually for example.The film was pacey enough for me not to worry about the time while I was watching it and entertaining enough for me to smile and chuckle along.But overall, Moulin Rouge is definitely only one for those aficionados in everything Luhrmann.Lavish. Raunchy. Ridiculous. Oddball. Melodramatic.",Moulin Rouge!
474,lazarus_ca_48,"Bohemian rhapsody, spectacular spectacular",8,22 January 2005,"I fell in love with Baz Luhrmann as a director when he released ""Romeo and Juliet"", and brought a timeless classic to life for a new generation. I was struck by his inventive genius -- I mean, who else would have thought of using the Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart as emblems identifying the Montagues and the Capulets? Yet even that did not prepare me for the bedazzling display of manic energy and glorious excess that is ""Moulin Rouge"". I saw it again recently on television, and realized just how busy the film is -- almost too much to absorb, a constant assault on the senses.Yet all is not noise and cacophony. There is harmony, too. Take, for instance, the sequence where ""Lady Marmelade"" and ""Entertainer"" are seamlessly woven together in a way I have not seen since the Big Band sound merged with soft rock in ""Xanadu"".Ewan McGregor (as Christian) is the heart and soul of the film, the troubadour of ""truth, beauty, freedom, and love"". He turns out to have a wonderful singing voice. Who knew? And he is able to deliver the hackneyed clichés with a perfectly straight face, genuine emotion, and touching naivety that makes you want to believe every word.Nicole Kidman (as Satine) pulls off the amazing feat of making you completely forget Marilyn Monroe ever sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"". Kidman makes the number all her own. She is the counterpoint to McGregor's lovesick swain -- a turn-of-the-century Material Girl.But the true genius of ""Moulin Rouge"" lies, not in its visual appeal, not in the acting skill of its principals and supporting cast, but in its bitingly satirical commentary on modern-day popular culture, seen through the lens of turn-of-the-century Paris.Luhrmann uses Christian and Satine as vehicles for an incisive examination of the cynicism and materialism of modern-day society, masked by the false romanticism of popular music and literature. Luhrmann slyly weaves classic song lyrics into the film's dialogue. Once the pleasant shock and surprise of recognition wears off, we realize just how corny they are -- or, more to the point, how jaded we have become.""Moulin Rouge"" is a movie with a message, and that message is best captured in the words of Sir Paul McCartney: Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs.

477,moonlightreflections,Elating and exasperating; a peculiar combination.,8,18 June 2001,"There have always been movies that have spawned countless hours of debate and controversy, be it for their subject matter or presentation.  ""Moulin Rouge,"" like Baz Lhurmann's previous endeavor, ""Romeo + Juliet,"" is the type of movie that is argued over because of its presentation.  Unlike ""Romeo + Juliet,"" however, ""Moulin Rouge"" is not the type of film that should have never come into existence.  It's not without its fair share of problems, but unlike most other movies today, it displays heart and is not self-conscious enough to concern itself with what people think about it;  it is what it is, and doesn't seem to be pretentious enough to laud its own sense of creativity.The story centers around Christian (Ewan McGregor), an aspiring writer who wishes to write about truth, beauty, freedom, and above all things, love. The only problem is that he's never been in love himself.  As he realizes this while he's typing in a hotel room in Paris, a random chain of characters and events lead him to the helm of a stage musical called ""Spectacular, Spectacular,"" whose script is to be presented to the resident courtesan and performer of the Moulin Rouge, Satine (played by Nicole Kidman with the calculating air of a businesswoman and the charming, seductive type of quality that makes it possible for a man to become completely infatuated with a woman upon first sight).The Moulin Rouge, despite its consistently packed house, is in financial shambles, so the owner introduces the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) to Satine in what in her business one would consider a formal meeting.  After a somewhat coincidental rendezvous with the writer of the new musical, the Duke agrees to finance the club, the only condition being that he possess all the rights--business and personal--to Satine.  Christian and Satine then fall in love and strive to keep the affair a secret, and the movie follows the established formula that leads to the Duke's discovery of the affair and the final winner-take-all confrontation.Narratively, the film fails in two aspects.  From the very beginning, we're told that Satine died and Christian never got to follow the relationship through to its desired point;  it renders the main conflict of the movie a little useless, though it strives to pull all the right strings in an effort to make the movie a poignant experience for the viewer.  The second problem? In order to do this correctly, you'd have to make the viewer be able to relate to both of the lovers personally.  Christian's nature is discussed just fine, but Satine is presented as nothing more than what her business requires her to be.  We see her go through the motions, but by the end, we really don't care too much for her character;  Christian is the one whom we pity, and that only makes the movie half the success that it could be in this aspect.In terms of presentation, the louder numbers tend to be a little distracting and offsetting in comparison to the rest of the movie.  The opening scene gives the movie somewhat of a grim prospect, so it's a little surprising when Christian and Satine first burst into a full-out love song.  It all quickly becomes second nature, though, and by the time that the characters burst out into songs from this point forward, just like in any good musical, it couldn't seem more natural.  Most of the songs do an exceptionally good job of letting the viewer know what the characters are feeling, but they feel a little contrived.  Case in point: Satine and Christian's revelation of their love for one another.  A medley of all the possible songs you could hear in contemporary soft radio stations, it ought to tell us something about the society that we're living in.  Either we're primarily concerned with making money at the expense of honesty, or we're incapable of truly describing how we innately feel, thus the quoting of every possible song in the world into a single number.Despite the blatant commercialization, though, the movie succeeds in a somewhat paradoxical sense: it feels very, -very- honest.  How could this be?  It's difficult to describe, but it appears as though this was Baz Luhrmann's primary intention, and somehow he managed to see it through to the end.  Perhaps it was the sheer potency of certain numbers, like the tango-esque ""Roxanne,"" which wove all the feelings of the movie into a tight little ball and had them explode in an aurally and visually overwhelming manner.  If as much care had gone into the characterization, I'm certain that this would have received a lot more critical acclaim.  As it is, you're possibly in for a bit of exasperation, elation, and the type of wonderment that's elicited when you see something completely, utterly new.  In today's world, that's somewhat of a rare accomplishment;  it's always better to savor it before it's emulated and commercialized, as ironic as it may sound.8/10",Moulin Rouge!

It would have been better if the editor and director could have let a single shot go on for longer than a second. It's a jumpy addled mess that is derivative of so many songs & movies there isn't a single original thought or idea in this film. Ewan McGregor & Nicole Kidman can sing pretty well, but it's not enough to save this film.Nothing personal intended here, but all you reviewers who say this movie is a masterpiece seriously need your heads checked.

I would like to respond to two previous reviews: Marya-3: I am 30 and would not consider myself to be ""very young"". (I remember when MTV actually played music and not the garbage it does today.) And so I think that the music used in the film was from my generation. Furthermore, to Burkemt29, so what if the gun took a trajectory that was not likely or that the the music wasn't correct for the period? It wasn't supposed to be an accurate portrayal of the Parisian Bohemian underground, IMHO, it was a surreal trip, a musical that was visually ""Spectacular Spectacular"" and a treat in the vast morass of cinematic nonsense that has been saturating our movie houses.I think that movie-goers need to adjust their thinking to accommodate the type of picture that one is seeing.

It was absolutely breathtaking. After a long time of debating on whether or not I should really check out this movie, I finally realized that I could rent it and not waste a terrible amount of money if I didn't like it. My opinion on the movie: I can't say for sure on whether I did or didn't like it. In many ways, I found it to be unique, and you could say that I'm not a big fan of musicals, but it turns out that the majority of the songs played in the picture is very modern.Another good thing about the movie is its unique art direction and set design, along with the stylized visuals accomplished via computers and miniatures. Australian Director Baz Luhrmann has quite a visual sense of style. He is able to combine the historical elements with today's and practically create a brand new movie genre, or enhance a movie genre, I should say. I must say that he's quite successful. However, I can't say that I'm particularly a fan of this ""new"" movie genre.Aside from having dazzling special effects and art direction, Moulin Rouge is rather boring when it comes to telling a story. In addition to my opinion on musicals, I'm not really a fan of romance movies, either. Unfortunately, Luhrmann was able to do nothing to fix this genre. To me, if a romance movie is good, then it probably has action, which I am particularly fond of, like Titanic and Pearl Harbor. However, I am able to admire the amount of effort by the cast and crew, who were able to try something new, it's just not my type. Story: D  Visuals: A-",Moulin Rouge!

I saw it on DVD and the sets are so lavish and unique that I know it must have looked (excuse the pun) ""spectacular"" in the theaters. But however glamorous the sets, this movie won't be to everyone's taste, in fact some may find it flat out strange. Set in 1899 Montmartre France, this is the tale of a struggling writer's (McGregor) attempt to win the love of a beautiful courtesan (Kidman), all the while trying to elude the evil villain (played splendidly by Roxburgh). Although set in 1899, this musical is scored with such modern day music, as ""Your Song"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""Like a Virgin"". Yes, it's an odd combination, but the music is incorporated into the scenes well (sometimes quite comically), and the performances of all involved are not to be missed. I was, however, a bit disappointed towards the end of the film, when the story line loses some of its witty edge and delves instead into an attempt at over dramatization. Here the film becomes unfortunately more laughable than it intends, yet this small glitch does not reduce any affection I felt for this unique and enjoyable musical.

You have to let your jaw drop in giddy disbelief as Ewan and Nicole, atop an elephant, duel to love or not to love in the language of late 20th century pop music verse.  Yes, the story is simple, the music deliberately plastic, and the entire production outrageous.

Yes, there are some cheesy moments but they're strangely cute to watch. The movie is so beautiful.

Entertain Us.,8,23 September 2001,"My first thought on seeing Moulin Rouge was that it marks such a definitive break from the deluge of mediocrity that has generally characterised the films of 2001 thus far, that the makers of such dirge as Tomb Raider should bow down and genuflect before Baz Luhrmann, their new God. The man is clearly a genius. Visually, Moulin Rouge is like nothing anyone has ever seen before. The mixture of contemporary and older songs in the turn of the century setting in the first half hour is breathtaking. After this, Romeo and Juliet and Strictly Ballroom, Baz is surely one of the greats of our time (as well as the campest film-maker since John Waters).However, Moulin Rouge is not without flaw. The finale is essentially at the start. It opens brilliantly (after a bit of scene setting) and thereafter gets slowly worse. It's never remotely bad and there's great stuff throughout most of its running time, but my attention was slightly wavering by the end and it's perhaps a tad too long.Yet it's still great and one of the few essential viewings of 2001. Ewan and Nicole can both sing and surprisingly the Scotsman is perhaps the better vocalist of the two. I particularly enjoyed the amusing rendition of 'Like a Virgin'. It's certainly the gayest film since 'Top Gun' was released.",Moulin Rouge!
493,Otis Lou Bohr,Wonderful One-Third of a Film,7,4 October 2001,"When I was first subjected to repeated viewings of the ""Moulin Rouge"" trailer (which preceded repeated viewings of ""Memento""), I swore that I would only watch it if someone paid me, say, ten dollars to (above and beyond admission, transportation, and popcorn). It looked to be the worst of Romance and Musical distilled into one dire waste of celluloid.But then I started hearing good things. Enough good things that I eventually dragged myself down to the two-dollar theatre to see it(after having procrastinated for a week or two in the hope it would finish its run and save me the hassle).So, you know, I'm not expecting much. I'm fully prepared to walk out; heck, I didn't even buy popcorn. So I'm rather surprised to find that within the first minute I'm thinking, ""you know this isn't half as bad as I'd thought it would be."" And by the time twenty, thirty minutes have elapsed, I'm thinking my God this is GREAT, how could I almost have missed seeing this film, I am going to sing its praises from the rooftops, *force* the unenlightened to go see it (see ""Memento"", above).And then, apparently, the plot kicks in. The part most people seem to enjoy the most. The endless repetition of a few choice utterly banal lyrics set to an absolutely unmemorable tune. That's right: the worst of Romance and Musical distilled into one dire waste of two-thirds of a movie's worth of celluloid. What can I say, truth in advertising.Still, the first third was so great that it sticks in my mind almost a week later, makes me want to see it again. I'm contemplating forming a first-third-of-Moulin-Rouge fan club...",Moulin Rouge!
494,jewelp24,The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love this film,10,11 May 2002,"The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was OK. Then it got nominated for BEST PICTURE at the Oscars and I, of course, had to rent it again. That second time I saw it, it turned into my favorite movie. I immediately went out to buy the video, and even thought about getting a DVD player so I could watch the deleted scenes. The soundtrack is amazing as well. I have over 100 CD's, but this one hasn't come out of my stereo since I bought it about a month ago. However, this is no Sound of Music. It's by no means a traditional musical. The soundtrack mostly consists of pop songs constructed so they're almost unrecognizable, and if you can forget that these songs weren't around in 1901, when the film is set, you'll love it. Almost everyone I know has seen this film and most have loved it, so I would recommend it to almost anyone.",Moulin Rouge!
495,Quirky-,"Wonderfully over the top, camp fun...",8,16 April 2002,"Moulin Rouge was surely a better film than Ron Howard's TV movie of the week weepie that eventually garnered a Best Picture Oscar in 2001 (A Beautiful Mind, in case you've blocked memories of THAT abomination out of your mind) and the fact that Baz Luhrmann failed to even secure a Best Director nomination in the face of such a low-grade 'true story' speaks volumes about the Academy.Lurhmann's film is a colourful swirl of song and dance, with Nicole Kidman giving a dazzling (and surprisingly good) performance as the doomed Satine, while Ewan McGregor acquits himself well as usual, even if neither of the lead actors can sing particularly well. That, however, is half the fun of Moulin Rouge -- where the characters break into song, the singing talents (or lack thereof) of the actors gives the re-modelled song numbers (Diamond Dogs, Children of the Revolution, Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend, Roxanne, Lady Marmalade, etc) a fun, almost spontaneous feel.It's a wonderfully inventive pastiche of the musical genre that deserves the recognition and success it received upon release. Lots of fun.",Moulin Rouge!
496,zordmaker,Well it was good enough for an Oscar wasn't it?,8,26 December 2011,"OK so here we go, another review of a film I also worked on. I was the head Art Dept Electrician on this film, meaning just about every light globe you see in every frame (and there are certainly a lot, possibly more than any other film in history) was put there either by myself or one of the four others on my team. But enough of that.In production, Moulin was a film where few crew knew what the film was about until we sat and watched it at the preview 12 months later. Both then and now, it blows my mind to watch such an enjoyable, indulgent and extravagant production - one of the few I can think of where the viewer really gets to see so much of what happened in front of the camera.For an art department crew member, watching a film you've worked on is so often like watching life through a keyhole. You know there was so much there but so little of it can ever be seen in the final cut. Not with ""Moulin Rouge""! Watching Every frame, every word, every song is like soaking yourself in a bath of creativity where there were no rules or if there was, they were often invisible.The Oscar (won for Best Production design) is rightly claimed. Whilst the performances, music and cinematography are all excellent, it's the unique designs that really jump out of the screen throughout the entire film. The success of ""Moulin"" as an artistic masterpiece is testament to the Australian way of film making, where art comes by way of cooperation, communication and a common drive to deliver the cast and director the best environment possible in which to present the story and performance. It's a long way from the ""Frustrated Incorporated"" way of working so common to American productions where time constraints often lead to sub standard results.So why an 8 and not a 10? ""Moulin Rouge"" in the end fell victim to Fox Studios Australia, displacing the production in May 2000 in favour of George Lucas' Star Wars prequel. As a result of this two major key sets were demolished well before time and well before it was possible to create the necessary special effect shots needed to bring the film to reality.This resulted in the construction of a number of additional scale models (at another studio) which were inevitably used for these mo-con shots - and resulted in the famed ""longest mo con shots in film for this week"".To most viewers, Moulin seems fine. But to me, and despite enormous effort to prevent it, the continuous multitude of continuity and lighting errors that abound in ""Moulin"" (where scenes cut back and forth from the real life to the model sets) is an ever present annoyance, preventing me from ever fully entering the director's intended world as it was planned to be. For this reason, Moulin will never be what it could have been - and stands as a warning to anyone who plans to outstay their welcome at a Fox studio.Still, it was good enough for an Oscar, and I guess (being in the department that earned it that Oscar) I should be (and am) satisfied. I do sometimes wonder what it might have looked like though had the producers gone ahead with their initial plans to build a full size outdoor back lot, thus avoiding the troubles at Fox and obviating the need for all that expensive mucking about with scale models afterwards.Moulin was a wild ride (both on and off screen) and I'll never forget it.And I guarantee, neither will you.Enjoy.",Moulin Rouge!
497,JackDevoe,"I also love ""Moulin Rouge!""",10,7 December 2002,"I wish I could come up with some better lines on why this movie is excellent, but I was blown away, aamazed, my eyes gleamed through the whole film, I gladly added a new favorite movie to my big list. Everything was just so grand. The best thing about MOULIN ROUGE was the fact that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman did their own singing. Ewan had such a beautiful voice. It was so emotional. He talks of releasing his own album, and I hope he does. I hear of people who say that the movie rips off so many songs, but that's not the case. MOULIN ROUGE does not take credit for these songs. The essense of the songs were used to bring out the theme of the movie, and the peopel who created these songs are given full credit, especially for having created such meaningful music in the first place. Besides singing wonderfully, Ewan and Nicole gave wonderful performances. I think Ewan should have been nominated for best actor at the Acadamy. And then he should have won. (Even though Denzel was great.) Jim Broadbent was also a fantastic note. His character of Harold Zidler was outrageous. He had so much energy, and was extremely theatrical. I loved his antics. Richard Roxburgh was also very good in playing a weasly villain. His mustache and floppy hair really added to his rodent like features that just made him so irritatingly evil, that I wanted him to lose in the end. I hope everyone realizes that the four themes of this movie are true, and I hope that they spread to everyone. I can honestly say that I was inspired after watching MOULIN ROUGE. While I don't isolate myself into movies, I do believe that they teach us how things should be, and MOULIN ROUGE is no exception of a film that shows us true meanings in life. I can't stress enough how much I love this film. SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR!10 out of 10!",Moulin Rouge!
498,robertodandi,9/10,9,17 January 2005,"I am not a fan of musicals. I often avoid to see them at cinema, but sometimes I see them on DVD and regret my choice. There are many musicals that can be considered the best movies ever: The Blues Brothers, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Rocky Horror Picture Show to name a few.This is a beautiful musical, too, that can compete for quality with the above mentioned ones, even if I voted 9 for this (my favorite ones are perfection). First the music is great. It has so many famous songs rewritten to fit in the script. I was delighted especially by the ""Like a virgin"" scene and by ""Show must go on"" (I'm always touched when I hear this magnificent song. It tells a lot of life and death and can be considered the most impressive testament by Freddy Mercury. One of my favorite songs ever). The initial song (I knew a boy..) is also very touching.So, the music is great, the script is funny and well written, the direction is wonderful, the actors are great, Nicole is sexy and as good as usual. But Jim Broadbent (the owner of mouline rouge) is the best actor in the play. He creates a character that you cannot easily forget.Don't miss this movie in DVD. 9 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!
499,north-julie,a stunning musical worthy of remembrance!,8,8 June 2005,"what can I say? I had avoided Moulin Rouge at the cinema like the plague, turned off by musicals full stop. Then when it appeared on video I avoided it again. It was last year when it was shown on television and I was absolutely blown away by it. A stunning movie full of heart felt emotion and beautifully adapted songs, it was such a brilliant experience watching it for the first time. From the moment Ewan Mcgregor started his rendition of YOUR SONG I knew I loved this film.Performance wise this film hits the mark. Being a musical, the actors don't take their roles too seriously, an example the cast of Phantom of the Opera 2004 could have learned from. Mcgregor is superb as the penniless writer who falls for the girl he can't have. When he sings YOUR SONG and his face lights up who admits that they weren't moved? His voice never falters, and he has such a magnetic screen presence coupled with an easy going personality that it is a small wonder that h ended up being cast in a role few people would have fought for him to play in the beginning. Kidman is good as well, playing her tragic role easily and making sure her voice doesn't let her down either. The Duke is superbly played by Roxbrough, and he does enough to make you genuinely hate this sorry little man with a weasly voice and quite ridiculous moustache. Leguizamo, who I have never seen in another role is fine as Toulouse, and Broadbent is good value as zidler, with his hilarious rendition of LIKE A VIRGIN raising quite a few laughs. His serious face as he recites the words to the song is amusing, ad he has enough dramatic thrust to make the audience believe that while he has a theatre to care for, he is still concerned about his stars.The songs meanwhile are brilliantly realised. YOUR SONG is performed superbly by Mcgregor, and COME WHAT MAY is suitably uplifting when first done, and then again at the end. The other songs are done well as well, mixing old style music with recent hits to forge well thought out partnerships. But the best song is WE CAN BE LOVERS, mixing some of the best love songs ever written into one, starting with ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE and finishing with I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. It also features the finest moment of the entire movie, as Mcgregor leaps to the top of the elephants head (Satines house) and sings out the famous song from the end of An Officer and a Gentleman WHERE EAGLES FLY. It is amazingly done, with the camera swooping past his delighted face as he belts out the words.Overall this is a magnificent achievement, and any faults such as choppy editing and the occasional camera wobble can be discarded.As they say, the show must go on!",Moulin Rouge!
500,dangerhorse,"Went in KNOWING I would hate it, ended up liking it!",7,2 June 2001,"I have seen thousands of movies, and Moulin Rouge met many of my must-NOT-see parameters, as follows:1.  I intensely dislike over-the-top lavishness. 2.  I abhor anachronistic films (like Luhrman's Romeo+Juliet). 3.  I am repelled by characters bursting into song. 4.  I am anything but a Francophile. 5.  I am not the least bit Bohemian.So Moulin Rouge should have instantly assumed a prominent place on my own personal Bottom 100 list.However, as a birthday gift to my significant other, I promised to attend the movie with an open mind and not harrumph, groan, snicker, or deride.  I steeled myself for the impending effort at self-control, and armed myself with a super-sized popcorn and soda planning on using the munching and slurping to stifle the involuntary sounds of repulsion I feared were inevitable.Much to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  If nothing else, Luhrman is a man with an intense and unique vision, and impressive skills at translating that vision to the screen.  I cannot help but enjoy such unquestionable skill and artistry being displayed, whatever my predispositions.If you have reservations similar to mine, I encourage you to open your mind and give Moulin Rouge a chance...you may be surprised, too.",Moulin Rouge!

If this is a trend in modern cinema, welcome.I knew nothing about the movie when I first entered the theater. I loved the movie right from the begining.

502,romper-2,The Emperor has no clothes,6,11 June 2001,"Never mind about polarising the reviewers (or at least the professional ones) - this movie polarised me. The production is spectacular and lavish, the set design is outstanding but stylistically I was left cold.It's not entirely Baz's fault. He's more of an addict than a pusher, even though I know it was him sliding the needle under my skin. I felt dirty and used, even as (or because) I enjoyed the spectacular. Was I being cynically exploited (as other reviewers have suggested) by someone that was simply out to sell a product, or was I being offered something that the purveyor believed was a valuable insight into the inner workings of society?I can cope - cringeworthy as it was at the time - with 'The hills are alive with the sound of music'. I have more trouble with the love scenes. It appears that both Christian and Satine are incapable of expressing their emotions except through the regurgitation of lyrics from popular music. I find it hard to empathise with characters who pledge their undying love for on another by using phrases equivalent to 'In the words of Dolly Parton, ""I will always love you""'. To be sure, musicals are based around scenes where emotions are expressed in songs, but they also have love scenes where the characters talk to each other rather than quote each other song lines.I am not immune to having had a song stuck in my head, or to associating songs with emotions and relationships. However, I do not confuse the song for the feelings. If being a romantic is shorthand for ringing up radio stations to get them to play 'our song', I'd have to say that I'm not a romantic. To me, being romantic involves a lot more - and at the very least it means refusing to express emotions at second-hand, which I see as a form of dishonesty.Baz's characters are emotional vampires, with no emotion but what they can suck from the carcass of popular culture. Maybe that was done deliberately. Maybe Baz meant this film as a satire on our obsession with living life vicariously. Certainly the overall effect was of a caricature, something larger than life - a fairy tale romance - which our post-modern sensibilities will judge as no more than pleasing fiction. The problem is that everyone has to be in on the joke for this to work properly.I feel that the film faultlessly panders to the lowest common denominator, where love becomes its own caricature and is debased in the process. Technically the film is a work of art, but it ends up feeling like a rock video clip - all style and no substance. I liked this film but hated doing so. Maybe the style was a cynical attempt to manipulate the audience. Maybe Baz believes that there is nothing new to be said artistically and that all new art can be no more that pastiches of existing works. In any case, I was left in awe of the technical achievements but untouched emotionally.I'm giving this a score of 6/10. That said, I think that it's a great film - possibly a classic, and it makes me wonder why I've given better scores to worse films. See it and marvel.

The actors and the decors are amazing, just like the camerawork, who acts like a crazy through the crowd at Moulin Rouge. The dressing by the actors was also nice done.

But nothing could prepare me for this.I loved the opening, with the weird-acting conductor, and the theatre-curtains. The start of the movie was very funny; Ewan McGregor definedly has a talent for comedy. The one thing I didn't like was the part with the sound of music-lyrics, though I have absolutely no idea why. The scene where we first enter the Moulin Rouge-club is spectacular, so spectacular you don't know where to look first. I certainly liked the Nirvana-Smells like teen spirit-part. ----------------May Contain Spoilers---------------------------------- After Satine's confusion between Poor Writer Christian and the Duke, we get to see the lovely scene where Satine ""gives it a try"" and falls in love with Christian after he starts singing. When she discovers who he really is, the real duke of course enters. This eventually turns into a really weird scene, where Zidler, Christian and his friends, and Satine try (and succeed) to convince the duke that this is all a rehearsal, because he gave her so much inspiration. I loved this scene and I don't think any of the other scenes was close to being that funny.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are both excellent singers and this of course, was the opportunity to try it out on screen. It works well. The elephant Love Medley is one of the most memorable scenes ever.But as the movie loses its funny parts, it gets more thrilling. We see how tragic Satine's life actually is, and that it's not just the glitter and glamour. The Duke really acts childish sometimes and I don't think that there was anyone who couldn't see why Satine doesn't fancy him. Christian's line, ""Because she doesn't love you!"" still gives me goose-bumps. And after the really tragic ending, I feel like it was really worth waiting so long to see this movie.",Moulin Rouge!

Way too much weird stuff going on! Confused, random, and pointless it seemed.  Then that ""Roxanne"" tango sung by a very annoying voice.  Yep, I hated it.  However...I sure liked that scene where they sang Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You.""  While strange, the opera-singing moon was an interesting touch. You know, that hindu scene was kind of cool too.  And the end really seemed to pack a wallop.  Maybe I should sit down and watch it again, this time paying attention? Was I ever blown away!  What a wonderful, beautiful movie.  I wound up watching the entire movie three times this weekend, NOT counting the time I read while my wife watched.  I replayed many of the scenes several times as well, in particular the Green Fairy scene (Kylie Monogue is rather tasty), the love song medley, the hindu scene, and the forgiveness scene at the end.Sure there are some plot holes and mistakes, but with the vision and beauty (as well as freedom, truth, and love - heh), I can overlook a few mistakes.

509,furex,Overdone Mess,5,5 February 2009,"If the songs in this movie were to be more rhythmic, you would have read tons of comments along the lines of 'MTV style editing' - I don't have a problem with fast editing, but in this one there are sequences composed of countless shots under a second in length, and they are long enough to make me dizzy.Senses are purposely overloaded and silly plot devices are layered one above the other to form giant heaps which should be conveying a feeling of joyful mindlessness, yet if you take a step back and look at the big picture the plot has a nice symmetry intertwined all throughout.The cast as a whole works, but Kidman came through as totally unbearable, she was like so totally over the top that if I was to compare her to a food, I'd say the cook has totally ruined the raw material by mistakenly pouring a ton of salt and spices. The underlying flavor of the character is totally blown away by the excesses of her interpretation (and FWIW the mindbending squealing) Despite involvement of famed producers like Craig Armstrong and Marius DeVries some songs are totally unlistenable (it doesn't help that the choice of Broadbent apparently couldn't sing even if it was a matter of life or death). I'm thinking of Show must go on, though on average the music wasn't so bad (the medley are a bit forced IMO), and couldn't avoid smiling when I recognized Gorecki.All in all there are good things in this movie but its flaws completely overshadow anything else.",Moulin Rouge!
510,bhat962,Best Musicial Romance Ever,9,15 June 2001,"I've seen many musicials (most of them consisting of love) from all over the globe: indian, russian, american, and so forth. This movie about Paris' famous Moulin Rouge is the best movie i have ever seen for musicial romance ever. It tells the story of a dying woman who is at her prime- and a poor man looking for a life, for love. He finds her and falls in love and the story goes on from there. One thing good about this movie is that i felt like i was involved in the movie- like i was in a open theater, close to the actors and actresses. It gave me that feeling of love and lust that most romance movies fail to obtain with the audience. Certainly this movie was a bit underrated and with its low box office sum- i do not see a sequel coming in works sad to say. But if you ever feel the need to watch a romance movie- which all of us someday after seeing all the categories of movies; horror, suspense, thriller, comedy, action, war, and classics- we will know that the one that relates to us the most is romance. 
Superb acting by Ewan McGregor and a near perfect performance by Nicole Kidman. Great songs and a great love story which has the usual man in the middle causing havoc. Out of ten stars i give it a nine, mainly because it does not contain the nonstop beat of excitement. Still it is a great movie and i recommend to all to see this movie, sooner or later.",Moulin Rouge!
511,Polter-Cow,Transcendently beautiful. A contribution to cinema.,10,2 June 2001,"*Moulin Rouge* is unlike any movie you've ever seen, even though it's just like every movie you've ever seen. It is the classic tale of boy loves girl, girl loves boy, one-dimensional villain gets in the way, the lovers spout cliches, and then either they live happily ever after, one of them dies, or they both die. Somehow, though, it transcends all these cliches and becomes something magnificent.A beautiful and often hilarious movie, it will probably be criticized as being ""style over substance."" Hogwash. *Moulin Rouge* is a ride. Not a Tunnel of Love, but more like a Wind Tunnel of Love. A radio DJ said of the movie, ""It's like you stuck No-Doze in every orifice of your body and drank a Mt. Dew."" For much of the first half, this is largely true. It almost feels like you're watching a music video, with frenetic action accelerated by dozens of frenzied cuts. Luhrmann recalls the slapstick comedy of yore, complete with exaggerated pratfalls and goofy sound effects. He immerses you in this world. I turned to my friend and said, ""This is the craziest ****ing movie I've seen in a long time."" The camera...oh, the camera. It zooms in and out, and flies around the elaborate set. The film is a directorial field day for Luhrmann. He creates a fairytale world, complete with a drug-induced Green Fairy voiced by Ozzy Osbourne.Like *A Knight's Tale*, it uses anachronistic music. Although I haven't seen *A Knight's Tale*, I believe it is far more effective here. In the Moulin Rouge, music and songs from the 20th century become integrated into the world of 1900 Paris. The amazing thing is, it fits. The patrons of the cabaret chant, ""Here we are now, entertain us, we feel stupid and contagious."" Luhrmann uses the music as if it were actually in existence at that time, and by doing so, he shows the universality of it. Music is one of those universal languages, and the most universal form of all is the love song. Whether it is 1900 Paris, 1987 Chicago, or 1473 Spain, love is love. The words Madonna, Sting, Elton John, and countless others used to portray love would have been just as appropriate back then, but they never had a chance to hear them. In one brilliant sequence, Christian (Ewan MacGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman) sing a dialogue about love, fluidly jumping from love song to love song, lyric to lyric. They don't sing these songs as songs; they sing them like they *mean* them. It is like a very trippy musical.The fact that Luhrmann pulls together a great deal of love songs is the key to appreciating the movie, because the love between Christian and Satine is idealized. It simply comes into existence and is there in its purest form between them, without logic, without sense. Over and over again, we are reminded that above all, this story is about love. And it really is *about* love. It is love in cinematic form. It is a visual and aural representation of what love is, what it means, and how important it is to human beings.The movie would not be able to get this across if Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman (looking more beautiful than ever) did not give incredible performances. You can see it in their eyes. You feel their pain. You feel their happiness. The supporting cast supports, as well it should. Jim Broadbent (Gilbert in *Topsy Turvy*) plays the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler. John Leguizamo is real-life midget artist Toulouse-Lautrec, a character I believe is akin to Shakespeare's Fool. And all of the cast can sing unexpectedly well, from a hilariously lyricized can-can to a hilarious ""Like a Virgin,"" from beautiful love songs to a disturbingly appropriate ""Roxanne.""The music is wonderful, from the orchestral score to the electronica. I advise you to stay and watch the closing credits, not only because you get to hear more music but also because it's not your typical black screen/white letters crawl, and it gives some predictable but appreciated closure at the end.All in all, *Moulin Rouge* grabs you and hits you with the sheer power of itself. When the movie ended, the audience was completely silent. I couldn't really speak. I felt like I felt at the end of *Requiem for a Dream*, except less like I was about to die and more like I had just been handed a transcendent feeling to simply experience, enjoy, and learn from. It is the best new movie I've seen since *Memento*, and as this looks like a slow year for great movies, look for it come Oscar time. Go see it. Now.",Moulin Rouge!
512,Bob-240,Nauseating piece of crap,1,4 June 2001,"They call this a musical but the leading actors can't sing or dance. The music (totally unoriginal and stolen) has been rearranged to lob off the tops and bottoms so that this troop no-talents can make their notes. The result is a score as flat as a possum on a Texas highway - and the movie stinks just as much. You can hear better singing in the average shower in any home in America. Much has been made that this is Kidman's first singing effort and you can tell that she is no singer. The same applies to the dancing. You never see their feet at critical times. One person in our audience stormed out the front and slammed the door about 15 minutes into the show. I applaud her judgment and only wish I had joined her. I frequent the arts, movies and musicals. The Sound of Music was a musical, Grease was a musical and even Rocky Horror Picture Show was a musical. This was a nauseating piece of crap that made me want to run for the door to purge myself of the vile pollution of song, dance and acting.",Moulin Rouge!

But if you are willing to give your eyes and your ears a brand new experience that will make everything else look and sound a bit dusty, this is the right movie. The simple plot which we can find in every classical opera involving an impossible love and some kind of nasty disease, has been enhanced up to the limit with incredibly luxurious settings, gorgeous costumes, a powerful soundtrack and an eye-striking editing. Moulin Rouge actually does not have any original content to offer - as said, the plot is so classical that it gets dangerously close to being naive, and in the soundtrack you will find only one original song, the others being elaborated covers to hits from the 70s, the 80s and the 90s - but this ""nothing original"" is presented to the audience in such a beautiful, witty, colorful, even redundant way that you cannot do anything but watch and be pulled into this fantastic world where nothing is important but Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love. The Bohemian Revolution is here, and nothing will be the same again.",Moulin Rouge!

Luhrmann seems to be obsessed with camera and editing techniques and oddity for no particular reason.  The modern songs immediately take you out of the intended setting, and all of the glitz is just a distraction from the fact that Luhrmann and Pearce must have written the screenplay during an all-night drinking session.  Why, oh why, could they not have tried giving us the real Moulin Rouge?  It would have been much more enjoyable than this half-baked concoction.",Moulin Rouge!
515,ellieforpeace,It works. That's all I can say to assure you.,10,13 July 2009,"Baz Luhrmann and Nicole Kidman. In Moulin Rouge!, they are both at their peak. Unfortunately lately, they've been in a slump. Their last film was Australia, a stunning failure. A western mashed sloppily into a war epic trying to chronicle the history of the country/continent. Kidman was humiliated by her performance; she knew how far she had fallen. She fled her native country, Australia, during the premier. She couldn't take the criticism. It was very disappointing. If you're wondering who Baz Luhrmann is, he is the director of Strictly Ballroom, Romeo+Juliet, and the aforementioned movies, plus the very bizarre tribute to musicals at the last Oscars. Oh, and that weird song ""Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)"" that was kinda popular once.But that really is neither here nor there, because this is Moulin Rouge!, made seven years before Australia and is seven times better. There have been at least five movies titled ""Moulin Rouge,"" though this one is distinct as it's the only one that includes an exclamation mark in the title. And features the music of Elton John, Madonna, and every love song ever written, set mostly to house music.Now let's, again, back up. Moulin Rouge! is about a boy, Christian (Ewan McGregor), from a small town who has gone to Paris to be a Bohemian writer. So as he sits, lost, in his apartment, and Argentinean falls through his roof. He's then commandeered into acting, then writing a play (""Spectacular Spectacular"") for Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), who is oddly changed from a painter to an actor. But anyway. Then he's sent to win the most beautiful courtesan in Paris, Satine (Nicole Kidman), from the Moulin Rouge (a dance club in this version), so she will act in their play, despite the change in writers. This happens in a matter of minutes, also allowing for the scene where the troupe trips on absinthe.It's a bizarre musical about freedom, beauty, truth, and most of all, love. And it's stunning. It takes you by surprise. You really do have to pay attention the entire time; it's very easy to miss something important in the frantic, kinetic, colorful mess on screen. I wonder how Baz Luhrmann convinced the other producers to jump onto this movie. ""No really, it'll be amazing. Look, we'll start with him in his apartment singing 'Nature Boy' by Nat King Cole, then this guy'll fall through his roof and he'll sing 'The Sound of Music' and they'll get on absinthe. No, and then there'll be this medley type number mixing up Nirvana and Madonna... and, oh my god you guys, it's gonna be great."" ""Umm... Okay...""And yet, everything really does work. All the elements fall together in a crazy chaotic way. It's a tragi-comedy, and there's a musical-within- a-musical. The movie starts loud, and crescendos like a symphony. It's the reason people expected so much from Australia, how could the Kidman- Luhrmann partnership failed after such a masterpiece? It's a theater piece, really. But it works. It works. That's all I can do to assure you. It's a top class movie.",Moulin Rouge!
516,enojones,June 2001 - in the midst of chaos,8,28 June 2009,"I remember Moulin Rouge! (MR) being featured very heavily at the beginning of spring and its subsequent release. The musical (outside of animation) was a dead genre until the arrival of MR. As I sit watching this movie on this day--a day after the music world has suffered a tremendous loss of talent, it reminds me of a few scant years ago when optimism and frivolity were the daily trends. Spiritual refreshment could consist of a trip to coffee bar, and nothing deep was required to put the world into order.MR was the height of this light-hearted time -- a film about competing lovers and a dying young woman--La Boheme simplified. MR followed such light films as ""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""American Pie"", and ""Scream"".Then, came darkness on a crisp, fall morning--change. But, the musical genre was revived. ""High School, the Musical"", ""Phantom of..."", ""Chicago"", ""Sweeney Todd"", and so forth follow in the shadow of MR.",Moulin Rouge!
517,Rainy-3,A unique and beautiful movie,10,7 June 2001,"Never have I seen a movie that has borrowed so much, with borrowed songs, a borrowed plot, borrowed settings, and borrowed dialogue, and yet been so original. You really have to see this movie to believe it, because the more someone attempts to describe it the more stupid the movie will sound.  There is no way on Earth that this movie should have succeeded.  If I had read the script or a plot outline I would have assumed that it would go down in history as one of the worst bombs of all time, but somehow this movie manages to pull off what should have been impossible. The music, the acting, the sets, and the directing were all wonderful, and it is one of those rare movies that you cant get out of your mind.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, even if just for the unique experience alone.",Moulin Rouge!

Just slow down for a minute! And turn that damned music down!Kurt Cobain is rolling in his grave.
You know folks, this motion picture stuff, it's too good to be wasted on entertainment. If you want entertainment, go get two hookers and an eight-ball. Use this medium for work which says something about us.

519,elle-10,Disappointing,5,2 June 2001,"We have just returned from this movie, and we were quite disappointed  in it. I cannot understand why Nicole Kidman was cast for this movie to begin with. Her very pale skin did fit in with the character's  tubercular illness, but I've seen Nicole act before, and she was more convincing in other parts. Some other actress of smaller height may have been better suited for this part. I truly don't think this part is going to help her career any. On the other hand, I thought Ewan McGregor made a better job of his part. His natural Scottish accent comes through very clearly in this part. I thought he did a good job with his singing. There were times when it was difficult to hear the actors singing for the noise of the music and the overcrowded cast.  I didn't think it was directed very well.I'm afraid I would advise my friends to go and see this movie at their own risk. We both had a headache from the noise and left before it finished. Just my view, of course. We all look at movies differently.",Moulin Rouge!
520,Nedla24,an audatious statement...,10,5 July 2001,"here it is... you ready for it?This will be the best movie of the year.  I'm making that statement now and unless something truly amazing comes out, this is the winner.  It is an innovative movie and deserves a place in history.  Never before, not in the days of Ken Russell or even Stanley Kubrik has a movie been so geared to evoke emotions from an audience.  Every frame, every jump-cut, every look, note, word, and movement has intention purpose and it all succeeds gorgeously.  Luhrman makes wonderful use of cultural standard songs from the ye old ""Diamonds are a girl's best friend"" and ""Sound of Music""  to classics like ""all you need is love"" and ""Lady Marmalade"" to the new songs like ""Smells like Teen Spirit"".  The plot is borrowed (La Traviata), as are the ideals (La Boheme, or Rent if you must), the drum beats synthesized, the whole movie is built on the talent of past creative minds.  This movie should seem false, all glitz and glamour but no substance, but that is not so.  The material is arranged so beautifully and carried out with a marvelous abandon by all the creative minds.  The words are so corny, the acting so over the top, the music so familiar and ""traditional"", but at no time does it ever pretend.  It never makes you forget that you are in a theatre watching a movie, yet it sweeps you off your feet like no other movie in the history of movies.  Not Braveheart, nor Lawrence of Arabia, nor Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, (certainly not Titanic or Shakespeare in Love) have the romantic sweep of this movie.  It overwhelms you with it's reckless romanticism that one can't help but be swept up and away, riding Luhrman's wave until the final frame.  I don't care if this movie wins Oscars, frankly no movie that deserves the oscars gets them (Quills, State and Main, High Fidelity, Magnolia) and even if they do, they don't get enough (American Beauty deserved at least 8, so did Crouching Tiger)  but at this juncture, I hope that it at least is nominated for Best picture, actor, actress, supporting actor (for Broadbent mostly, but Leguizamo, Roxburgh, and Jacek Koman all deserve recognition), director, editing, cinematography, art direction, costumes, original song, and perhaps (if there was enough original material) score.

This movie takes place in 1900. The opening was so boring, I slipped out of the theater and joined the movie ""Shrek"" for the second time. When it was over I returned to ""Moulin Rouge"" for the last 10 minutes. Other than the lavish sets which were not shown off as well as could have been...it was again simply awful.

522,Jen_UK,The film that should have swept the board at the Oscars is ...,10,18 April 2002,"Moulin Rouge!From what I can gather reading other user responses on this site, this film very much divides audiences into black and white categories. You either love it or you loathe it. May I be so bold as to suggest that this is solid proof of a work of art? It leaves no one indifferent. I reside in the former category, that of love! (bordering on obsession if I'm honest) I saw this film five times at the cinema and would rate it as one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have ever had the privilege to partake of. Why did I love Moulin Rouge so much? Have you got a spare couple of days?:1 - Stunning, breathtaking visuals. So colourful and enchanting to look at.2 - Baz Luhrmann is a genius. There was not one moment in this film that he had not agonised over. I would like to have seen him presented with a 'Best Director' Oscar this year, as this man is gifted and deserves huge kudos. What a surprise that the academy once again opted for a conventional choice, and the outrage that Luhrmann was not even nominated! There is no way in this world that any of the nominees put as much heart and soul into their work as this man breathed into his. He is a phenomenon.3 - The music. Beautiful. There was not a piece of music or re working of a song in the entire film that I didn't like and I can only hope that Baz Luhrmann's film will help start a new era in getting musicals back onto our cinema screens. I'm sick of teen filcks I want to see more intelligent films like this one! 4 - The perfect balance of humour, surreal visuals and comedy with the tragic love story. Any film that can make you laugh and cry in equal measure has to be applauded. 5 - The Performances. First of all let me say how stunning Nicole Kidman is. She is captivating and reminds me of a screen Goddess from the golden age of cinema. Her voice is, granted, not west end musical standard but it is very, very capable and human sounding. Ewan McGregor is a star with a lovely boyish look about him and a Robbie Williams style singing voice. Both are fantastic, play their roles to perfection and have excellent chemistry together on screen. A delight to watch. The supporting cast are also excellent. I especially loved (the amazing) Jim Broadbent and Caroline O'Connor. I could go on and on, but I would like to put a theory forward as to why some are disliking this film. I honestly think that it is above the heads of the average member of the cinema going public, most of whom are accustomed to hi concept trash and popcorn films. Luhrmann's film is postmodern and unconventional - two factors which make it unnapealing to a popcorn movie crowd. Despite that, I do accept that even to individuals who 'get it', its dizzying pace and hypnotic look may still be too much. Overall, 'Moulin Rouge' is an acquired taste. For what my view is worth, I would rate it as one of the finest films ever made and the nearest I have ever been to a theatrical experience in a cinema building. Thank you Baz Lurhmann: you deserve every success. Thank you for daring to be bold, and daring to break new ground. Thank you for the passion that goes into every frame of your work. Thank you for your energy, your vitality and your dedication! Just a huge thank you really! The Academy need their heads examining for overlooking this masterpiece!",Moulin Rouge!
523,bigspeegs,Nausiatingly Overrated,4,7 January 2002,"I know I'm going to get hate mail for this review. ""Moulin Rouge"" is just one of those movies. Everybody just adores it, and you're stuck there thinking ""what?"" Sure, I could see where everybody's coming from. Love story, good production values, pop songs, and all that jazz. But ""Moulin Rouge"" is a movie that is as easy to despise as it is to love.
The premise is simple. Take a whole bunch of pop music, plop it in the middle of a turn-of-the-century atmosphere and stick in a love story. Some would say such simple words wouldn't be enough to describe this film, but really, that's all it is. ""Moulin Rouge"" seems more like a reason for a soundtrack than a film.Ewan McGregor is Christian, an aspiring poet traveling to France for inspiration. Little does he know, inspiration will without a doubt come his way soon, in the form of Satine (Nicole Kidman), a popular courtesan working in the Moulin Rouge. He instantly falls in love, but of course, he can't live happily ever after with her (""The only way of lovin' me, baby, is to pay a lovely fee!"") And Satine has other plans for her future than spending it with Christian, and as her dreams to become an actress start to turn into reality, the greedy Duke of Monroth tries to bind her exclusively to him. So, take this, throw in ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", ""Like A Virgin"" and more, and what do you get? A ludicrous fiasco that's not even fun enough to be a sequel to ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" (yes, that IS a movie...)
For a while in the beginning, the film is a joy to watch. But this lasts only a few minutes, for as the story starts to develop, the film stops having fun with itself and begins to set up a serious, dramatic mood. That would work if this was any other movie. But in ""Moulin Rouge"", the utter ridiculousness of the placement of pop songs undermines anything notable. In the first scenes, I smiled when Christian randomly blurts out ""The Sound of Music"" and ""All You Need is Love"". Very quickly, however, I was getting tired of all the oo-la-la. By the time Zidler (Jim Broadbent) is singing ""Like A Virgin"", I was laughing at them, not with them. And don't even mention the ill-timed musical number set to ""Roxanne"".
I have to admit though, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman certainly do have the pipes to carry out the job. They sing with passion (the same can't be said about a certain Mariah Carey) and truly bring out some spirit in the middle of all the chaos. It's too bad the film is such a pain, because they give performances worthy of recognition. The rest of the cast seems like they're having a good time, which does make the film slide along a little easier.""Moulin Rouge"" starts with an idea that something could be done with. However, director Baz Luhrmann sells-out completely, completely giving his movie up for commercial success. There is really little inspiration after the first shots, and the premise might be able to sustain for two hours if the way it was carried out wasn't so gag-inducing. Quick note to Mr. Luhrmann: it's a very bad sign when you're is laughing so hard during dramatic moments that at the end, your friend turns to you and suggests you leave ""before the people in the back start shooting"".",Moulin Rouge!
524,jhendricks97,A Unique and Enjoyable Musical,8,6 June 2001,"`Moulin Rouge' seems headed for certain disaster in the first 20 minutes or so.   Its hard to keep a straight face when characters suddenly burst out into song, or do not even seem to obey the laws of physics!  These problems overwhelm the picture, at first.  But then once you become accustomed to the pictures style you can appreciate the movie for what it is.  An age old story of love, loss, and betrayal.  All told in a unique and interesting way.I really enjoyed this movie.  The story was faced paced, and often very funny.   And surprisingly, both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have pleasant singing voices.  If you think you can handle a musical, `Moulin Rouge' is definitely worth a look.  4 STARS OUT OF 5.",Moulin Rouge!
525,hasekamp,You really need disk 2,8,25 April 2002,"The movie is very good. No doubt about that. But the editing is too fast for me. Take for example the wonderful tango sequence. In my opinion that wonderful sequence is so much over-edited that it looses most of its impact. On disk too (DVD version) you can see the sequence as it should have looked. This goes for some other sequences too. The cutting is so fast, that one can hardly see what happens and many shots get lost in that way. That really is a pity. That is my criticism. The story, the music and the acting are first class. Nicole Kidman, who has impressed me since ""Bangkok Hilton"", is better than ever. The costumes and sets are fantastic. (Everything was filmed in Australia; the crew did not even see Paris!). One can hardly believe this.I have to see this movie again and maybe yet another time until I think I have really seen everything. But I don't mind. It is a feast for the eye.I would never have given an Oscar for the editing, however, but I have started with that criticism already. With a bit more restrained editing I would have given 10/10, now it is ""just"" 8/10.",Moulin Rouge!
526,MetaLark,A fantasia of sight and sound,5,8 January 2002,"This movie was interesting to me and possessed a kind of quixotic charm, once I had got used to the frenetic noise and motion. It's very original and a hard film to classify, lying somewhere between a cartoon and an opera. Some of the music--cribbed from diverse sources--is very beautiful, particularly a rendering of ""The Show Must Go On"" by the character Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) and a chorus of seamstresses.The introductory musical theme--based on ""Nature Boy"" from an old movie ""The Boy With the Green Hair""--is a haunting and unforgettable melody made popular by Nat ""King"" Cole in the late 1940s. ""Moulin Rouge"" seems to want to pursue some obscure parallel with that earlier film by the use of green lighting on Christian's (Ewan McGregor's) own hair during one of the reprises, though I'm bound to say I couldn't detect much similarity between the two characters. (I watched it a second time to see whether there were any other such allusions, but if so, they were over my head.)Nicole Kidman does a fine acting job. She is an exquisitely beautiful ""Satine"" and shows great courage, if perhaps not the best judgment, in singing her own songs. But that's okay; the movie is, after all, a celebration of ""truth"" (and better this than the abomination of Eliza Doolittle's dubbing). McGregor's singing voice, on the other hand, is a most pleasant surprise--somebody, give him a Grammy or something.If you can overlook the noise and the freaked-out kinetics, and you don't require realism in effects or story, you might just like this flick very much. It offers two beautiful protagonists, some comic touches, and lots of heart. It's worth a look, and better the second time around.5/10",Moulin Rouge!
527,popnoff2001,A Truly Great Cinematic Marvel!,10,5 July 2004,"Yea, after reading some of the recent comments, it's obvious that not everyone likes or gives this movie more than a passing glance then blows it off as rubbish or silly or nonsense. But then again I wouldn't want to watch what they consider a great cinematic masterpiece, which in my opinion, is exactly what this movie is! From the great scenery and costumes to the uplifting and inventive use of modern music in a bygone era of Paris circa 1900, this movie had it all.Sure, it took a little patience in the beginning because it went against what we are used to in movies. At first you are bombarded with music, dancing and sometimes bombastic dialouge but once it got to the actual story of a love that could not be, it was as good as any romance novel could hope for. It had Shakespearean elements of a tragic love story much in the style of Romeo and Juliet. Does Satine run off with the writer or marry the Duke(whom she despises) just to save the theatre and all it's actors who really are just a big group of misfits but family in every sense of the word. In those days, actors were not celebrities, like they are today, they were more like circus carneys or gypsies. Moulin Rouge, with all the twists and turns and pulling at the emotions of both lead actors, succeeds as the audience is drawn into their love story and feel every emotion as though it were their own! You fall in love with the leads and your heart aches for their doomed love. In the end, you feel the loss as deeply as anything you would feel in real life. I left the theatre in tears and i don't usually cry about anything! I say, watch it again and tell me if it isn't a powerful movie that ranks up thier with the best of what Hollywood has produced in the past 30 years or more! I could see Audrey Hepburn in the lead had this movie been shot in the 50's or early 60's and Marlon Brando or James Dean as the writer who falls madly in love with Satine. If you didn't like the movie, well I say your heart is hard and jaded and you are just plain boring!2 Thumbs Waaaaaaaaaaaay UP! I rank it as one of my top 5 favorites of all time and could watch Moulin Rouge every year for the rest of my life and love it like the first time!",Moulin Rouge!
528,popnoff2001,Only for the Openminded and Enlightened Minds!,10,5 July 2004,"Like many viewers of this movie, it was all too odd and bizarre at first and overwhelming and I avoided watching it for nearly 2 years. I finally saw it in late 2002 and have now seen it 6 times and own the DVD. The music is amazing! I have become a huge Josh Groban fan(he actually sings the Ewon Mcgregors songs). He was 23 at the time. Like anything that becomes great, it is hard to swallow at first. Just like the Beatles when they changed thier style, people HATED it, but their later has become classic. People always want the safe and normal status qou when it comes to art and music. nothing out of the norm. But I say NORMAL is BORING! What is todays oddity becomes tomorrows masterpiece and ultimately stand the test of time. This movie, in my opinion, will be considered one of the great movies of our time and future generations will like it very much. Did you know that the public rejected ""It's A Wonderful Life"" at first? Hated it! But it has become a Christmas Classic that we watch every year like it was out first time seeing it. Same thing with ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". Just consider ourselves( the ones who love it) to be ahead of our time because we got it!",Moulin Rouge!
529,philipsavory,I hate this!!!!!!!!!!,1,6 May 2004,"This is pure bilge. This barely constitutes as a film. To begin with I was enthusiastic about this film, I was expecting a visual tour-de-force and some show-stopping tunes. Instead I got lots of flashing lights, a bunch of diabolical cover versions and Richard Roxburgh!This movie makes me angry, it frustrates me more that this film is so popular. Why? I haven't heard one good explanation yet. The story is pants, I knew the conclusion from reading the back of the video case, save yourself two hours and do the same.I have nothing against Baz Luhrmann, I thought Romeo and Juliet was quirky and stylish, however watching this made me want to extract my eyes with ice cream scoops and replace them with extremely hot billiard balls. Contrary to popular believe Ewan Mcgregor CAN NOT SING! HE'S SINGING ONE NOTE THE WHOLE TIME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!Anyway if you find yourself with two hours or so to live and want to pass the time, don't watch this, you could go out on a high by watching True Lies or Aliens.

530,joelsecurities,Topsy-Turvy with Nicole on Acid,10,20 May 2001,"I was at loss for words concluding this picture, but now that I'm composed I feel Alive. Moulin Rouge did not feel like a movie, it felt like watching a live performance on Broadway. This was Topsy-Turvy with Nicole on acid, she's Satine a woman of the night torn between Christian, a poor writer and a Duke. The love story is as simple as Killer's Kiss, but its comic-dance scenes are as great as Everyone Says I Love You. McGregor belts out tunes with talented confidence, complimented by Nicole singing like a love-bird, she moves you and you stare at her in disbelief as she furiously dances, participating in the Moulin Rouge. The audience applauded at her with passion at the end of a hectic scene where she's talking to the Duke, hiding Christian in her room. There are many magickal sequences that will be remembered, as stamps of the cinema standing the test of time, simple scenes powerful and eloquent. A french man singing Roxanne with a thick voice, while the director like a panther moves from two simultaneous actions of Satine with the Duke, being forcefully cornered to a Roxanne tango, while Christian walks the streets of 1900 Paris, singing the song in a different place. If this was on Broadway, receipts for The Producers would be cut in half, what a show, what a show I tell you, a rare gem you will see again & again & again.",Moulin Rouge!
531,stodmyk,Director Baz Luhrmann is easily one of the most important filmmakers of our time,10,6 June 2001,"Baz Luhrmann is a freakin' genius.The man behind the 1996 visual orgasm that was William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet has done it again. This time, he hasn't breathed a taste of modern life into the Bard, but rather an even deader art form: the cinematic musical.Yes, Woody Allen tried it a couple of years ago with Everyone Says I Love You. But while Allen's material hasn't felt fresh since well before he ever laid eyes on his step-daughter, Luhrmann has injected innumerable pop references into his ode to Paris circa 1899.A young writer named Christian (played by Ewan McGregor), new to gay Paree, falls for a courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman) upon his first visit to the outrageous club Moulin Rouge. Okay, so the metaphor in the movie can be a little obvious at times... The story from there is interesting, but incidental. As shot by Luhrmann, these two are so captivating a screen couple the remainder of the film could involve them singing about poor penmanship and it would be worth admission.McGregor is every bit the smoldering star he promised he'd turn out to be, and Kidman once and for all proves that she is perhaps the most photogenic woman on the face of the planet. Both turn in surprisingly good vocal performances, and have no trouble carrying this picture.Luhrmann smothers every scene in overwhelming colour; even his usage of sepiatones or black and white shots are dripping in style and hue. The supporting cast is breathtakingly talented. Kudos to the casting agents and/or executives who fanagled the likes of Jim Broadbent as the sweaty, greedy, worldly bossman; and whomever it was that foresaw Richard Roxburgh as the ferociously needy Duke of Worcester should be summarily knighted.Luhrmann's vision in creating Moulin Rouge is almost incomprehendible. Four parts music video, three parts Picasso and five parts chocolate mousse, this film should take a number of Oscars next year; the Academy may as well hand over the best musical score statue now, and be surprised -- be very surprised -- if Luhrmann isn't nominated to walk away with the best director prize.",Moulin Rouge!
532,fepp,"Wonderful movie, wonderful music, wonderful style",9,30 December 2001,"* WARNING: CONTAINS A small SPOILER (but this movie is not really about the story anyway, so it probably does not matter :) ) *Moulin Rouge is all about style and appearance.  But what style!  The wonderful way the movie is executed makes it incredibly, breathtakingly, enjoyable, despite having a rather pedestrian love story as its ""plot"".
To be analytical, the basic story: a theatre making a story about two lovers with an interfering rich third man, by a cast living through the same experience, is nothing new.  Old idea, but good.  The fact that the heroine dies at the end might be strange to American audiences, but is the only reasonable way to finish the movie, without really solving the ""problem"" of a rich lover and poor loved. Anyway, this movie lives from its style. The way in which popular songs are used, using lyrics not written for this particular movie as if they were an original musical score, is brilliant.  Each song has its own set of connotations, due to the group who first made it popular and the trends it belonged to, and these connotations sometimes make the whole experience quite sublime.  The start, where Nirvana's ""Smells like teen spirit"" is intervowen with Patti LaBelles ""Lady marmalade"" is just plain genius!  The use of ""Sound of Music"" is hilarious. You wait and wait for Queens ""The Show Must go On"", and finally it comes.  Elton John's lyrics for ""Your Song"" are really allowed to mean something more... ""Like a Virgin"" is a crazy take on the Madonna music video, and the list just goes on and on and on!The visuals are often stunning, and the way is which realism is completely ignored just adds to the fun (I believe it was a bottles thrown out of a window is made to bounce on the Eiffel tower :) ).  There is a cartload of slapstick thrown in, like the cartoonish climbing of the elephant by Toulouse Lautrec, or the way in which an unconscious actor falls through the hero's roof at the start.  Just wonderful!Never mind the hero blabbing along about ""love is everything"": anything else would be utterly at odds with the strong colors and high volume of the movie! This is not about being realistic or believable, but about being entertaining!  Never mind that the end is given at the start of the movie: that is part of the drama!All in all, a movie that is a jumble of wonderful scenes set to fantastic music, and with a thread of a plot that is just thick and dramatic enough to carry it all through.  See it!",Moulin Rouge!
533,lori-1,Beautiful,10,7 January 2002,When I first rented this film I was worried that it would be awful. To some members of my family it was . My grandpa walked out after 5 Minutes which was sad because it was a very moving movie. The story revolves around a English writer who falls in love with French prostitute who works at the lavish nightclub The Moulin Rouge. The problem is that she is supposed to belong to a rich duke. That is basically the plot . The music is very good and lovely at certain points. So if you haven't seen it please do and if you have see it again You won't be disappointed.,Moulin Rouge!
534,glassorange,Its about time.,9,13 March 2002,"""Moulin Rouge"" is a spectacular film.  I generally don't like musicals at all, but I really had fun with this film.  It is expertly directed by Baz Lurmann, whose talents were unfortunately wasted in the overindulgent ""Romeo and Juliet.""  He has made a film which lights up the screen almost from beginning to end (emphasis on almost - there are one or two relatively dark scenes).Lots of people didn't like ""Moulin Rouge"" because of the story, not only those who posted comments on the IMDb, but most of people I talked to personally about the film.  Personally, I like the story, and I think that the extraordinary cast does a terrific job of acting it out.  This film is full of energy, excitement, great music, great acting, and great fun.  I gave it a 9/10.  I recommend to everyone.  If you don't like it, apparently you're not alone.  If you do like it, however, then you're a real human being.",Moulin Rouge!
535,hosolo,Generally - I liked it,7,10 August 2006,"""Spectacular Spectacular - no words in the vernacular can describe this great event, you'll be dumb with wonderment"". That line stuck with me for a few days, after watching this piece of artistry. Colorful, fast-paced, MTV video style motion picture that reminded me of Whose Line Is It Anyway Song titles game. The Like A Virgin sequence was modernly hilarious. True, it won't appeal to everyone, but there's actually a love story surfacing above the glitz and the glamour. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both do a nice job of portraying the ""doomed lovers"", and they do a good job of singing too. I still think Kidman should have been nominated for ""The Others"", but Moulin Rouge just shows her range more for comedy, music and drama. Very exquisite. So some of the songs were after the Moulin Rouge time period, I sang along with it anyway. The movie is like a nightclub itself, fun and entertaining. Overall, an original concept and an unforgettable experience.",Moulin Rouge!
536,MobiusAg,Absolutely Dazzling!!!,10,13 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a Diamond among gems. This movie stands out as a brilliant piece of film. It has it all...spectacular imagery, a wonderful story, sensational performances and an amazing musical score. I was extremely impressed by this film, considering I wasn't even going to see it. The movie is beautiful. It has brilliant colour, amazing costumes and is just a wonderful movie to watch. The sets are very well done and I applaud the performances of all involved. John Leguizmo as Talouse Latrec is incredible, taking nothing away from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor who are magnificent in their roles. I really found the addition of modern music, set in the early 1900's quite an innovation and loved the work that went into these numbers to weave them seamlessly into the film. This film has a vison and it simply fulfills it to a brilliant conclusion. I have not seen a film this good in a long time and whole heartedly recommend it to all. It is also has humour that adds to its charm. I hope to see this film recognized at the next Oscar Ceremonies. It truly is a wonderfully well done piece of movie making and I cannot say enough good things about it! A solid 10 on my list...Moulin Rouge is a must see movie for all!",Moulin Rouge!
537,TimeTrvlr03,Brilliant! Delicious buffet for the senses!,10,8 June 2001,"Baz Luhrmann manages, with Moulin Rouge, to take the fast pacing of Romeo + Juliet (which I did not like) and apply it effectively to this extravagant, musical love story.  Kidman and McGregor are the perfect pair.  His devastating good looks and her timeless beauty fit the scene perfectly. The wild nights of the Moulin Rouge, the famous French nightclub that provides the dramatic backdrop for this tragic tale, third in the ""Red Curtain Trilogy"" from Luhrmann.  Satine (Kidman) is the tragic heroine, ""Sparkling Diamond"" of the Moulin Rouge.  Christian (McGregor) is the Bohemian writer who becomes Satine's truest love and champion.  Her beauty drives the Duke to bitter jealousy, which threatens the two lovers.  The trailers may make you feel as if you know the end of the movie, but trust me, you don't!
The plot is not complex at all.  Its the simple tale of tragic, but pure, love.  Satine and Christian represent all that is good, wonderful and right in love and the world; their story shows that love can overcome everything, except nature.  The Duke is the evil that can destroy such beauty.  All of the relevant details play out in the sumptuous sets of the film.  Lavish replicas of the once great club, right down to the elephant, historically acquired for the Moulin Rouge at the World's Fair.  The costuming is gorgeous, vivid colors and rich fabrics.  Further, there is a wonderfully comical and supportive cast of characters (Zidler, the Unconscious Argentinian, Toulouse Lautrec, etc).And boy can Kidman and McGregor sing!!!!  They are outstanding in their duets and can even carry themselves on their own.  They don't hide behind backup singers and studio recordings, they just belt the songs out for our enjoyment.  The other songs in the film are wonderful, new renditions of old favorites (Like a Virgin, Lady Marmalade, Up Where We Belong, etc).  They are relevant and fast paced, in keeping with the movie.  (I must note that there was one musical element that my sister absolutely hated -- the singing moon.  It was a bit much. :-))This movie is a masterpiece and I will be buying it the moment it comes out on video.My rating for this movie would be off the scale!!  Enjoy!!",Moulin Rouge!
538,tan_pandit,bucking the trend wonderfully,9,4 December 2001,"With all the Hollywood monopolisation of recent times, this was a wonderfully fresh and daring buck of the trend. I am amazed that there are so many good reports on this site though as it is not the kind of film that I would recommend to anyone. But it seems that you are mostly in agreement with me that M.R. really is a masterpiece. The wonderfully camp performances of all involved, and the outrageous costumes and scenery were a real joy. One question though, watching the (perfect) performance of Nicole Kidman, how on earth must they have felt doing this. Like right fools probably, and more than a little worried about the final outcome. However, B.Th. managed to put together a beautiful feast for the senses, and made the unworkable work, and the unthinkable dazzle. 9/10",Moulin Rouge!
539,loopydate,There was a film...,10,3 July 2002,"...a very strange, enchanting film...I was one of the millions of skeptics out there that refused to accept ""Moulin Rouge"" when it first came out.  I, like many, assumed that the movie musical was dead.  I was wrong. I recently rented the film on DVD, and now can barely go a day without watching it (now that I bought it on VHS) or listening to the soundtrack. Where to start? Well, for one, Nicole Kidman has shot to the top two or three on my list of favorite actresses.  After her amazing role in ""The Others,"" paired with her mesmerizing performance as Satine, the beautiful courtesan in ""Moulin Rouge,"" anyone who doubts her acting chops needs to get their head checked. I've been a fan of Ewan McGregor's for a long time, but it was more of a fan-boy ""Star Wars"" type of respect.  However, now that I've seen him carry himself as a leading man (in a non-indy, non-crappy-horror film), he, too, is now one of my favorites.  While a bit crude, his singing voice is amazing.  His portion of the ""El Tango de Roxanne"" sequence is one of the most heart-rending in the entire film, and at the end...well, without giving any spoilers, this hard-hearted movie fan got something in his eye. After seeing his portrayal of Harold Zidler, I'm amazed that Jim Broadbent won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Iris"" instead of this.  I guess it was a choice between the two roles, and ""Iris"" was a bit more Academy-friendly, but Zidler was one of the ultimate love-him-AND-hate-him characters put on-screen in a long time. Apparently, I jump to conclusions a lot, because I had John Leguizamo pegged as an annoying little loudmouth.  His portrayal of Toulouse Lautrec changed my mind.  It was impressive enough that they made him look like a believable dwarf, and that the lisping French accent didn't grate on my nerves, but he carried several key scenes with a strength of character I'd never seen from him. This movie is, to use a worn-out cliche, a roller-coaster of a film.  It starts with an almost-ridiculously manic pace, jumping from shot to shot like a Linkin Park music video.  Then, there's a wonderful, brief pause (for comic relief) as Christian (McGregor) begins to write his story.  ""There was only one problem:  I'd never been in love!""  I can't explain the shot, but it had to have been one of those that Baz Luhrmann came up with over a glass of absinthe. Speaking of absinthe, the manicness of the film picks back up once Christian, Toulouse, the Unconscious Argentinean (possibly my favorite character in the film), and the rest of the Bohemians, have their first taste of the green beverage.  After a brief encounter with Kylie Minogue's Green Fairy, they're rocketed into the Moulin Rouge itself where those with weak stomachs probably get nauseous from the frequent camera moves. It is this kind of stop-and-go filmmaking that makes ""Moulin Rouge"" one of my favorite movies to come out in the last five years.  Baz Luhrmann is truly a visionary, and the fact that he was denied a Best Director nomination is sickening. Needless to say, the soundtrack is amazing.  In what other movie (other than, perhaps, ""A Knight's Tale 2"") could you see such an eclectic mix of modern rock transposed back a couple of centuries?  Seriously, in 1899, when the word ""grunge"" still meant dirt, the men at the Moulin Rouge are singing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" while the Diamond Dogs (the club's showgirls) croon ""Lady Marmalade"" and Satine belts out a medley of ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" and ""Material Girl.""  From there, Christian serenades Satine with ""Your Song,"" ""All You Need Is Love,"" ""Heroes,"" ""Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong,"" ""Silly Love Songs,"" and a host of others. But, undoubtedly, the most amazing musical piece in the entire film is when the Unconscious Argentinean, with the help of the wicked (why?) dancer Nene, turns ""Roxanne"" into a spine-tingling tango.  Mixing that song with (what I believe is) an original composition which I can only assume is titled ""Why Does My Heart Cry?"" lends the scene added potency, making it one of the most surreal musical experiences I've had at a movie since the ""Golden Years"" scene in ""A Knight's Tale"" (which I also loved). Isn't it odd that David Bowie's music has been around from the days of jousting, through the Bohemian revolution, up until modern times?  I wonder which era were the ""Golden Years,"" exactly. Anyway, I digress. I know I've rambled about this movie for a while, but I definitely think it's worth the words.  ""Moulin Rouge"" is the most visually amazing film I've ever seen, and if last year were not the year of ""AKT,"" this would have been my favorite of the year. So, kudos to Luhrmann, McGregor, Kidman, Broadbent, Leguizamo, and the rest of the people who assembled this truly amazing film.  You all deserve a big pat on the back. Ten out of ten, at least.",Moulin Rouge!
540,lduperval,This story is about love,10,10 January 2003,"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return. This movie has passed ""Life Is Beautiful"" as my favourite movie of all time. It's got everything: romance, jealousy, heartbreak, revenge, sadness, happiness, DANCE, MUSIC! EVERY-THING! My biggest regret is to never have seen it in a theater.I saw it for the first time almost a year ago, shortly after it came out on DVD. When I saw it, I was totally confounded by the first fifteen minutes of the movie. The camera work, the music, everything went by so fast that I had a hard time figuring out where Baz Luhrmann was trying to go. Then eventually, I caught up with the pace of the movie. I absolutely enjoyed it the first time around, and I watched the extended Tango de Roxanne over and over again.The use of the music was ingenious and marvelously magical. (I must say, though, that I've been listening to the soundtrack almost every day for the past six months). I am rarely moved when I watch a movie but this one moves me to tears.I don't like musicals (I did like Grease when I was still a kid, I watched about 10 minutes of Evita before turning it off, and although my kids watch The Sound Of Music on a regular basis, I have yet to see the whole movie). But this movie, with its  simplistic storyline and reused music, is an absolute masterpiece.I think the only way to really, truly appreciate this movie to its fullest is to watch it more than once. Baz Luhrmann has said that he wanted to recreate the confusion, the splendour and the craziness of the Moulin Rouge when it first opened in 1899. Nowadays, audiences are totally blasé. There is a preponderance of sex, violence and a total absence of innocence and bewilderment in our modern society.Imagine entering into a world that is unlike anything you've ever seen before, something you couldn't imagine in your wildest dreams. That's how people probably felt the first time they went to the Moulin Rouge. In order to understand it and appreciate it, they needed to go back again and again. Luhrmann has succeeded in generating the same feeling with today's apathetic audiences. From the music, to the dialog, to the story itself, there are constantly two things going on at the same time. It is nervewracking and confusing but highly effective.I believe this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time. After all, it's a movie about truth, beauty, freedom, and above all things, love!",Moulin Rouge!
541,emmahamilton-86644,"Dazzling, sumptuous, glamorous, funny, tragic, wonderful",10,23 October 2020,"I first saw this on the cinema when it came out.., I now regret not seeing it again! It really is a funny, fabulous, eccentric, fantastic film. And all these years later, I've been to the Moulin Rouge in France twice. - trust me, it is equally as fabulous. This wonderful film by Baz Lurhmen is so brilliant. It is hilarious, funny, and tragic. Wonderfully eccentric, brilliantly cast, beautifully told. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman shine as star crossed lovers in this gorgeous homage to the famous MR, done with modern versions of wonderful songs. Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh are fantastic too....just fabulous all round, Glamour, fun, humour, naughtiness, tragedy....just class....",Moulin Rouge!
542,buffy-34,You'll be dumb with wonderment,10,24 June 2001,"Since the opening of this movie, I've seen it four times. I own the soundtrack and an original movie poster. To say I like this movie is an understatement. I wanted to see it since I saw the trailer. But being as how movies have really sucked as of late, I had really no expectations except that it looked promising. This movie is more than promising. I'm not going to say it's the best movie ever made, but it's the most creative and beautiful movie I've seen in years. I realize that not everyone will like it. People have different opinions, but I thought it was great. I've never been a fan of Nicole Kidman, but she was absolutely fabulous in this movie. I don't care what anyone says about her performance, because it was OUTSTANDING. As an actress I know how hard emotional scenes are and she handled them with grace and made it seem that she wasn't acting at all. Ewan McGregor also did a commendable job. Both actors have singing voices that could soothe you to sleep. True, the songs weren't original, but as one critic said, it seems the songs were written just for this movie. Every familiar song you hear, every lyric, seems to go right with the storyline.This is a great movie. Not for everyone, but definately for me.",Moulin Rouge!
543,bruno-51,This is why I go to the movies,9,8 July 2001,"A tremendous love story; the best production value the movie industry has to offer; a consistent, unique style, which was campy and romantic without being particularly trite; superb acting (and singing!) by a dazzling Nicole Kidman and a beautiful, sincere Ewan McGregor; a self-assured sense of story that didn't feel the need to explain, or cover, or be sly; and the music!Walking out of the theater, the only problem I expected most folks to have is if the movie did a cover of a song that they had a personal attachment to; as for me, I felt the movie was simply one song too long.  But the ending was brilliant.Go see it, relax, and enjoy!",Moulin Rouge!
544,lore-5,What a freakin' mess,4,11 June 2001,"Oh, my, what a disappointment this was.  There was just TOO MUCH.  Too much spectacle, too many cuts and jumps, too much directoral cleverness, too much mugging for the camera, too much noise, too many pop song references, too much STUFF.  Even the musical numbers, which could have been what made this movie very very special, each were made up of multiple songs and intercut storylines.I considered getting up and leaving halfway through, but resisted the urge in hopes that the film would improve.  It did, slightly, calming down in the second half.  But by that point I was too annoyed to get lost in the story.""Moulin Rouge"" is to ""Strictly Ballroom"" what ""Phantom Menace"" was to ""Star Wars"".  When the directors didn't have access to enormous budgets and whiz-bang special effects they gave us well crafted, entertaining stories instead.  Given free rein the story is lost to the visuals and I, for one, am left wanting my $6.75 back.",Moulin Rouge!
545,jrhpax,What a stinker!,1,19 June 2001,"I can say just two good things about this movie: Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sing better than you might expect; and a few moments are visually rapturous. Otherwise, the movie is ludicrous from start to finish, with a plot that's little more than an outline, sharp changes in tone, MTV-video style production numbers, and -- worst of all -- songs that end in mid-song, without conclusion. In fact, the movie rather resembles a long, bad MTV video. See it at your own risk.",Moulin Rouge!
546,Bschorr,I didn't hate it.,3,4 June 2001,"On the plus side this film is visually very impressive.  Colorful, and wonderfully filmed. On the down side they had a lot more film than story, the musical numbers, while charming, are fairly repetetive and, lovely though Nicole Kidman is, there were far too many extreme closeups of her and McGregor. It began to feel like a dermatological exam with shot after shot of Kidman's nostrils or McGregor's pained eyes.Leguizamo puts in the kind of terrific performance we've come to expect from him; in fact, Kidman is the weakest link in the cast and I thought she did fine. You can't fault the performances.  Using the modern songs was an interesting touch and part of the fun was figuring out which song they were performing...unfortunately after an hour and a half it was more or less all of the fun.This is not a film you can ignore; bold, loud and musical; it's clear that there was a vision and this is a powerful embodiment of that vision. Unfortunately the vision was a lot shorter than the film. 
It's a bad sign when you're watching a movie and your mind drifts to another, totally unrelated, movie -- but 100 minutes into Moulin Rouge I found myself admiring a scene from Pearl Harbor which I'd seen the week before.Bravo on the visuals, good performances all around. But not enough story to carry the film and I suspect that most of the audience I saw it with just didn't get it.",Moulin Rouge!
547,elshuefan,"I loved the ""Love-it-or-Hate-It"" movie of the year",10,5 January 2002,"CONTAINS SPOILERS! I just love original movies that are made by professionals that are willing to take a chance. Any idiot can buy some dynamite and blow things up, capture it on film and call it a movie. It's been done thousands of times, and I'm tired of it. This movie was a welcome diversion from Hollywood's usual rehashed stuff. Like a lot of people, I thought ""MTV clone"" during the first 15 minutes. After the film settled down, I was mesmerized by the performances of not only the stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor, but the supporting cast as well. Each supporting actor seemed to be the right fit for their respective parts. The recurring sentiment of ""The show must go on"" spoke volumes about the struggles of everyday life, and the resolve people have to overcome obstacles. I thought that using modern music worked sometimes, and didn't work at other times, but overall, I can't think of anything that I would change. My wife got the DVD for Christmas, and after we watched it twice, and it's going around the circuit to friends who wanted to see it, too. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Even if you don't like musicals, give this one a try at least once. Like us, you may be quite surprised and were glad that you took the plunge into a film that is visually stunning and quite unique.",Moulin Rouge!
548,dwales,Spectacular but unsatisfying,4,1 November 2001,"No-one could fault the sheer energy and spectacle of this film and the efforts made by all to make it a success. But for me, I left vaguely unsatisfied.I'm not a great Ewan McGregor fan - I feel he doesn't have the range of acting talent to bring any depth to a performance and Nicole, nice-looking as she is doesn't have the charisma or presence to make this work.I felt the modern songs sat rather uneasily in this old fashioned setting, especially Roxanne performed in such an over dramatic way. When the Police did it it was effective because of its controlled understatement which brought out the real desperation and emotion in the song. Also I felt Heroes was murdered hideously.Why couldn't they write some original songs for this production - they've spent enough on everything else. Still, I did find myself at the end wondering what would happen next so the movie was a success in that respect.",Moulin Rouge!
549,maria-512,God Awful.,1,19 May 2007,"I hate to pan a film, but I find it utterly mind-boggling that this film found an audience at all. Some people seem to love it, as the other ratings bear out, but still, I must disagree.The acting was laughable, despite the talent of the cast, and the singing was painfully bad. The best that can be said about this it is that it was somewhat visually interesting, but that isn't nearly enough to carry a film. The plot (loosely based on Camille) was virtually nonexistent, allowing the soundtrack to carry the story. Perhaps if the singing wasn't so bad, that might have worked, but in this case, it did NOT.This film was so bad that I couldn't see it all the way through. It's the only film I've ever walked out on.",Moulin Rouge!

Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman provided Oscar winning performances...wonderful voices, some of the best emotions I've ever seen, and very funny.What else can I say? Along with ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""A Beautiful Mind,"" it wasn't nominated for Best Picture and they didn't get on the top three slots on my all-time favorite list for nothing!! VERY well written, wonderful acting, singing, choreography, costumes....I could go on and on. I'd rate this a 10/10.",Moulin Rouge!
551,Jason_VoorheesIMDb,If you like it fine but this is the most unoriginal movie i've ever seen.,1,31 March 2014,"So this brought back the movie musical? So movies like Chicago Hairspray & Sweeny Todd are all because of this awful movie? Well I have another question: Does Moulin Rouge still hold up after so many years? OF COURSE NOT! It didn't even hold up when it 1st came out. But everyone was amazed with how great and original it is. Yes there's nothing more original the playing songs we all know and love and reusing plot lines the even Twilight would laugh at. (auidence gasps) That right I said it. Twilight is better and more original than this. 1st let me say what I like about it. 1. The movie looks brilliant. 2. The Cinematography is good when you can see it. 3. As the movie goes on the editing does slow down allowing us to see how well the shots are set up. That's all the nice things now let's talk about the bad stuff. 1. The remixes they did aren't good and the only good song is Zidler's Rap. I don't know what it's called but that's the only good song. 2. The editing goes by so fast no shot lasts more than 5 seconds. As the movies goes on it does slow down as I already said. 3. It's loud, stupid and there's no dramatic backing for it in any way. 4. Satine wants something more? What else could she want? To be an actress? Oh yeah this isn't enough. Being hailed as a goddess, men wanting you, women wanting to be you, performing every night to hundreds of people greeting you with applause. Yeah, I can see how being an actress would be ENTIRELY different from this! 5. They use the word love over & over & over and they never explain what it is. We just know that it's really, really good and everyone wants it. They just say the word over and over more than they actually do analyze it. 6. The woman who gave the Duke the hint that Satine and Christian have been seeing each other. WHO THE HELL IS SHE?!?! She's not a main character or side character.7. With the Duke wanting to kill Christian why didn't Zidler get out of the business deal with him? 8. With Satine dying why didn't she tell Christian? Hell why didn't tell the Duke that would probably turn him off! IT MAKES NO SENSE! Hurt him to save him?! THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING I EVER HEARD! All she has to do is tell him the truth and figure out a plan together! How the hell is she saving his life if he's destroying him psychologically? What's worse: dying with the one you love or being emotionally assassinated by that same person. So Satine's breakup with Christian is about as convincing as Edward's breakup with Bella, but thankfully, Christian is about as smart as Bella, so he completely falls for it. 9. Truly in love? That's such bullshit! (mocking) Oh, all you need is love lovelovelovelove...Who treated anyone they truly loved this way? Why would you slutshame her in front of an entire audience of people? Who calls that love? That's not love, that's bitterness! Oh sure, her actions are abjectly stupid and she's the victim of bad, stupid writing. But him? He's just despicable! He's evil! For as many times as he sings about LOOOOVE, he treats her in the most insulting, dirty, mean-spirited way that you can treat a human being. And the dwarf's over here like ""Oh, she wouldn't do that!"" and yet him, the one that's in love with her can't figure this out? ""Oh yeah, love! I forgot about that! That's right! I'M SORR...you know what, I'm not even sorry, but we're still in love. SO LET'S SING ABOUT IT! In front of everyone and everything's okay! Oh wait, you're dead. Awww."" How would you feel if your loved one had some stupid misunderstanding that sprung from bad writing and then threw out all of their negative, horrible bile in one fell swoop...IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY! 10. So just as Christian gets done calling her every word for ""whore"" in the English language, the dwarf suddenly drops down and--what a shock--quotes more songs. So the whore he said he would never be manipulated by is now letting himself be manipulated by, it just so happens that she's telling the truth? Singing fixes everything. F*CK THIS MOVIE!",Moulin Rouge!
552,kezop_male,Virtually unwatchable,3,7 December 2004,"Oddly, this movie was heralded for it's visual granduer. Meanwhile, I found it virtually unwatchable. I struggled through the first 20 minutes on DVD before stopping to head here to see what others had written. Maybe I was missing something. Apparently not. I appear to be seeing everything the movie has to offer, the supposedly clever juxtiposition of modern music in a ""period"" piece. I say ""supposedly clever"" because I found it trite instead of clever. I was supposed to be enamored by the rich, visual tapestry of this movie. Admittedly, it was impressive, but not impressive enough for me to suffer through the paper thin plot of the story. I found this movie annoying.

I want to see if they show anything that was cut, there's a very small part of the story that seems unexplained and really doesn't effect the outcome but I have a feeling there might have been a scene that ties it together.

Let me ask one question--when you read a love story, do you think of the handsome prince and the beautiful princess in their fairy tale castle, or do you think ""Boy, I wonder how they run the plumbing in that thing?""There's three responses to that question.  1.

I am at home right now while my wife and our friends watch the rest of this boring overhyped pice of junk. The diaglogue consists of the most inane drivel you have ever heard, making no sense.  It is like an overacted melodrama, but there is no story or vilain or anything of any kind to hold your interest.  In my life I have never walked out on any film (even though I've wanted to), but this film was so boring and horrible, I was about to climb up the wall.  I was so upset at how miserable this film was, I left to come home and do the world a service by writing this review.  There are several other IMDB reviews about Moulin Rouge similar to this one.  If you don't believe me, then believe them!",Moulin Rouge!
557,cscjr8,Audacious!,7,7 June 2001,"I found the first half of this movie very impressive. The mixture of modern songs, big production musical numbers, gorgeous stars like Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman doing their own singing (good enough: they aren't as good as Meryl Streep in ""Postcards from the Edge""), and editing tricks thanks to computer animation just had me sitting wide-eyed in appreciation. I would give this part of the movie an 8 or a 9 on the IMDb scale of 10.However, then comes the second half of the movie. Early on, two or more songs are sung simultaneously (I remember particularly ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"") in such a way that works beautifully. But later, in a scene where 3 or 4 songs are sung in this way, the trick loses its magic and it sounds as if everyone is just screaming the lyrics. The story's superficiality also begins to take its toll on the film in the second half. The last 30 minutes are especially difficult to watch due to an excessively complicated plot and a drawn out finale.But at least Ewan McGregor emerges from the movie unscathed. (I cannot say the same for the miscast John Leguizamo.) Let's have more of Ewan.",Moulin Rouge!
558,jrphelan,Run for your soul! Glitz and MTV flash triumphs over story and substance in this frenetic mess of a music video movie!,2,7 June 2001,"How can I describe the movie Moulin Rouge?  Glittery multi colored cotton candy? a huge flashy cubic zirconia diamond? hallucinations of a drunken drag queen who has taken too many bad drugs?   Yes, all those!  The movie was one long series of glitzy shouting melodramatic climaxes interspersed now and then with some soap opera dialogue.  Acting??? No room for it.  Plot???? trashy remake of La Boheme (speaking of La Boheme, if you want to see a tragic love story set to music, see the opera La Boheme.avoid Moulin Rouge).  In short Moulin Rouge is a triumph of glitzy style over substance.  Special effects, fancy camera work, and choppy editing run amuck!  On top of that the singers whisper their lyrics then shout them, one gets frazzled by all the razzle-dazzle. When the cliché climax finally came, I was so benumbed by all the frenetic scenes that instead of shouting: More! More! (for a good movie),  I beseeched Hollywood:  Less! Less!!!!.     Moulin Rouge reflects our pop culture, where special effects and over the top screaming singing has replaced  substance and intelligence and genuine emotions.  It says, it you scream loud enough and make it flashy enough, they will come, and buy. All in all a total disasterso much talent, clever sets, numbers, camera work, editing, good actors,and all the director could come up with is a 110 minute MTV music video,  and a bad one at that.  If you like music videos, then you may like this movie.  you will be safe, there is no substance to it.  Just eat that glistening spun sugar and go for the ride!",Moulin Rouge!

We've seen it 4 times.,Moulin Rouge!
560,solebanana,Wobbly start but developed tremendous force later,9,8 October 2001,"This strange film, apparently a film within a film, started off rather eccentricly and at various times included literally a singing man in the moon, a green angel with wings and people flying a la superman. Despite being set in 1899-1900, it included music from such ""19th"" century songwriters as Elton John, Madonna, and Paul McCartney, and bizarrely even parts of The Sound of Music. Supposedly a lot of this was composed spontaneously by the penniless hero, a romantic dreamer who spoke of love but knew nothing of it. Let's be honest, this wasn't a promising start, but what developed steadily as it went through was a very human story of emotion and conflict, including a choice between feelings and materialism. As to which won, and what became of the hero and the courtesan he fell in love with, you'll have to watch it and see - but expect a real tear-jerker of a story which will ultimately make you forget the preposterous way it has been filmed. Too emotional to be my ""favourite"" film, but certainly in the top ten.",Moulin Rouge!

My friend whom i took to this movie, was not really looking forward to it. But at the end of the movie, she declared ""That is the best musical i have ever seen."" Ewan McGregor truley steals the show, Yes Nichole Kidman is a beautiful talented actress, But in my opinion Ewan really is the key and talent of the movie. His voice!! I had no clue he could sing so well. Im so buying the soundtrack. My favorite part, is when He burst out....""This Hills are Alive with the sound of music""I give it a 9 or 10...can't decide.

563,col_rutherford,The Most Overrated Film of the Decade,3,31 May 2004,"Baz Luhrman's frenetic ""Moulin Rouge!"" is one of those films that people either love or hate. I have to go with the latter. This is the epitome of a generation of MTV-style filmmaking: the movie is little more than one long, exhausting music video. There is very little substance amongst all the stylistic excess. The characters are all cartoonish stereotypes and the plot is formulaic. The comedic aspects of the film are very broad and not very funny. I found John Leguizamo's portrayal of diminutive painter Toulouse Latrec particularly annoying. The film's message is basically about the power of love (or ""wuv"", as half the characters in the movie seem to pronounce it), but the love portrayed here is shallow.There is no subtlety or pacing in this film. Everything is done to the extreme. ""Moulin Rouge!"" could be diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. I became annoyed with the unnecessary camera movements and fast-paced editing. During one scene, I counted 45 cuts within one minute of screentime! Meanwhile, the soundtrack is a bizarre medley of modern pop/rock hits and songs from old movie musicals. This concept is novel, but the novelty soon wears off. While I must give a tip of the hat to any film that tries something different in this age of cinematic mediocrity, watching ""Moulin Rouge!"" is equivalent to eating cotton candy: it's colourful and gives you a quick buzz, but you soon get sick of it.Rating: ** out of ****",Moulin Rouge!
564,jrm-3,Fantastic and Magical,10,22 October 2001,"For the first fifteen minutes of this movie, I was sure I had made a mistake.  I was totally caught off guard, and the quick-cutting style of Luhrman made me dizzy and almost nauseous.  But then, something magical happened.  Nicole Kidman came on the screen, and the movie suddenly switched gears.  It slowed down a bit (just a bit, but enough), and a love story began.  Familiar songs, such as ""Your Song"" filled the theater.  And suddenly, without warning, I fell in love with the movie.  I couldn't believe the change from my initial reaction to my end reaction.  I think some people absolutely hated this movie because they couldn't shake that initial reaction, whereas I sort of fell into the fantasy of the whole experience.  Yes, it's silly that they're singing modern songs.  Yes, it's silly that, at one point, they appear to float among the clouds while pixie dust sprinkles around them.  But I accepted these as images, almost as metaphors, to help explain the excitement and beauty of the love story.  To make a long story short, ignore the bad reviews and give the movie a chance--and stick around past the first 15 minutes--and you'll see that it's truly unforgettable.",Moulin Rouge!
565,raimi3,Please see this film!,8,20 January 2002,"First of all, I am a guy who loves historical dramas, action movies, horror movies, and other guy mentality related stuff. Secondly, let it be known that I love Moulin Rouge! Moulin Rouge is not only my favorite movie of 2001,(LOTR being a close second), but also my favorite surprise of the year. I did not expect to like this film. I left the theatre confused. ""Was I supposed to like this movie?"" I asked myself. ""Oh man are my friends gonna make fun of me."" But who cares. I'm sure everyone out there has felt passion for a movie. I felt true passion for Moulin Rouge! What caught me first was, of course, the music. Please, Academy, recognize this crowning achievement. Through the music I was taken into the story with an amazing clarity. I felt the emotions of all the characters. I laughed with them, and yes, cried with them. I have new respect for the young Jedi Ewan. Ladies & Gents, this guy can sing. This guy can sing good! And so can the lovely Nicole. The two of them were a screen match made in heaven. And you can't go wrong with John ""The Pest"" Leguizamo playing the great, vertically challenged, french painter Toulouse-Lautrec. This great film was well worth the taunting jeers of my stupid friends (ignorance is bliss to them if ya know what I mean). Forget what you think you know, and just enjoy what a true screen gem looks and feels like. Then buy the soundtrack and DVD like I did.",Moulin Rouge!
566,DizzyDitz,Did I miss something?,5,27 March 2002,"I don't usually comment on movies just to trash them, but the popularity of Moulin Rouge has always baffled me. Besides the later arrivals, the movie seasons of 2000-2002 had been dismal(Jennifer Lopez was up for an Oscar for ""The Cell"", Julia Roberts actually won an Oscar). I went to see Moulin Rouge because it looked interesting and I liked the actors involved, and, frankly, because there was nothing else to see. Moulin Rouge is a melodramatic, sometimes funny musical. The storyline is sappy, sagging, and cheesy; reminiscent of Gothic literature. Nicole Kidman does a fine job as Satine, but even her genuine emotion can't save this musical from seeming corny. The music is decent, but not heart-wrenching. There are a few appropriate songs (Elton John's ""How Wonderful Life Is"" is used endearingly), but the most memorable moments come from the comic numbers (See ""Like a Virgin""), and the unintentionally comic numbers (See ""Roxeanne"".) A standout is Jim Broadbent, who is absolutely fantastic as the Moulin Rouge's manager, approaching the performance level set by Joel Grey in ""Cabaret"". Don't expect a heartbreakingly poignant movie, but if singing star-cross'd lovers guided by fate and fortune are your specialty, you'll be pleased. For everyone else, you can expect to be sufficiently entertained.",Moulin Rouge!
567,thealexanders,One of the best musicals I have seen,10,15 February 2002,"It has taken me over a year to see Moulin Rouge since it has been released.  I am sorry it has taken so long.   This movie was marvelous.  Well done to all involved, from the writer/director Baz Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearce, through to the stars, Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor and the rest of the cast.   From start to finish this musical was rich and vibrant and showed a fresh approach to a musical presentation.   I was unsure how I would react to the heavy use of colour and frequent close ups, but they brought me into the action.   There has been some criticism of Nicole and Ewan's singing.  I thought they did a great job.   Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh were well cast and represented their roles very well.  All round this was a 10 in my book.",Moulin Rouge!
568,WMOLSTAD,Owwww! My head.,4,7 June 2003,"The entire film speeds along like an hour long Pepsi commercial.  Less intriguing when compared to Baz's Romeo + Juliet.  Ewan McGregor saved certain parts of this movie.  A well constructed vision, but just too WHAM - in your FACE! - too overblown. I suppose that was the point of the whole thing, but it certainly gave me a headache much worse than the delightful Absinthe scene.  The swooping camera shots made me delirious.

569,steve49er,What a surprise!,10,21 April 2002,"Having believed that ""The Lord of the Rings"" should have won the oscar for best picture, I was surprised to find that ""Moulin Rouge"" was, actually, the better picture.  Without reading any publicity about this movie, I had thought that it would be a typical musical centered on life at the Moulin Rouge in Paris.  How wrong.  This movie was more surrealistic than could be imagined.  It played more as a colorful, crisply directed, film that would puts MTV musical videos to shame. Why this picture's director wasn't nominated for an award is beyond me.  The story, a romance between a Bohemian writer and the theater's star attraction was poignant. Both stars play their rolls to perfection.  Ms. Kidman was beautiful, more so than ever I realized.  But, the true beauty of this production was in its rendering. A musical using both original songs and works by such writers as Elton John and Paul McCartney. It might not be for everyone.  But for fans that enjoy the color and excitment of a beautifully crafted piece of work, this is it. An ""art"" film placed on the big screen.  And, art it is.",Moulin Rouge!
570,FoxGarrison,"Spectacular, Spectacular!",10,21 June 2002,"I have to admit, I was a bit sceptical when I heard that Nicole Kidman was going to sing and dance in a musical.  This, I thought, couldn't be from the waife that brought us some memorable characters--one being Tom Cruise's wife...nevertheless, I was amazed!Tonight I saw Moulin Rouge! for the second time.  The first time I was numbed by the dance, color, tectures and animated characters...quite frankly, it felt like a real bad acid trip.  But having seen it that very first time really made me want to see it again.  It was funny because I tend to shy away from a second viewing of a film until sufficient time has past that I can forget about the plot and watch it with a clear mind.  Moulin Rouge! noooooo, not a chance.  As soon as I saw the movie, I wanted to see it again, and you know, really...I don't think everybody has seen it all noticing all the rich decor, wonderful lighting and background action.  I think it's because the cinematography was done so beautifully that it really makes to step back to see it all at different angles.The story itself is simple: Love told through song.  And trust me, a musical such as this--you have never seen.  The casting was very well done, the lighting, cinematography, direction...all of it was fabulous.  I don't think I even have a complaint about this movie, it is just wonderful and really a must-watch movie to enjoy over and over again.",Moulin Rouge!
571,mgirl,"Splashy, but Unorginal Plot",7,9 January 2003,"I have to say probably the best thing about this movie was the orginal arrangement and splicing of well-known songs. Sure the songs themselves are not orginal, but I really enjoy the creative use of them. Both soundtracks are a joy to listen to, except many of the songs are the orginal cut and not how they were played in the movie. Onto the problems. This is an out and out rip-off of Camille. Both stories are set in Paris at about the same era. Both Satine and Marguerite are women who use their bodies to get what they want. This later backfires when they actually fall in love with the wrong men. Both men come from poorer backgrounds but are armed with high ideals. There are also men in both stories using their money to buy the affections of Satine or Marguerite. To complete the case for plagerism, both women have consumption which plays a major role in their decisions.",Moulin Rouge!

Very enjoyable, easily watched again and again.We can sing along to the music now and soak up different visual details every time we watch the movie. The two-dimensional Parisian backdrop is extra cool, the elephant and windmill especially... and the main character's typewriter means of story telling felt just right.What a complex and heart breaking love story, a struggle between survival and indulgence, selfishness and community (family). Universal themes with a very unconventional delivery. LOVED it!! And who hates showgirls?",Moulin Rouge!
573,GJBStar,Hard to fault ... but not to everyone's tastes,10,23 October 2003,"Moulin Rouge is the 3rd of Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain trilogy and arguably, the installment that takes the Red Curtain concept the furthest.  As such, it is not a film that will appeal to everyone either in concept, story, style or execution.  I, however, find it a film that it is difficult to fault but can understand the criticism of others.  As for the plot, it is loosely based on the Opheian myth (Orpheus and the Underworld) and is a love story which uses very similar story telling devices to Romeo and Juliet and is based around Montmatre and Moulin Rouge in turn of the century (1899) France.  The key device that this film will be remembered for is its use of modern songs in a period setting (not an original concept but taken further than previous films have dared). 
The acting and musicianship of the headlining actors is excellent and each brings something to the film as a whole.  Christian (Ewan McGregor) is an idealistic, naive writer and McGregor brings a degree of honesty and vulnerability to the role, particularly in his early scenes with Nicole Kidman.  Kidman herself plays Satine, the courtisan in chief of the Moulin Rouge and completely owns this role.  It is impossible to imagine anybody else playing the part as well as Kidman and her musicianship, particularly in ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend) is also top-notch.  Jim Broadbent plays Harold Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge and mostly is there to provide comedy.  However, he performs well and creates real shades of light and dark.  Finally, Richard Roxburgh as the Duke, is a good comedic villain, who also managed good variation between light and dark.  In fact, the only characters I did not care for were the other Bohos such as Toulouse (played by John Leguizamo - a Luhrmann favourite).  They suffer from being the story devices to get Christian to the Moulin Rouge and as such, they feel shoehorned in to scenes taking place after the Elephant scene.The direction is typical Luhrmann - brash, colourful, quick and stylish. Admittedly, the first 20-30 minutes of the film are not easy viewing as they invoke the style of old WB cartoons and there is also a lot of jump cutting. This is, I believe, the main thing which puts certain audiences off. However, if you can get past this, the direction settles down post ""Spectacular Spectacular"" number.  It's hard not to like this - it has charm, wit, drama and romance and for the most part, is an original concept. The set and costume design also show an amazing attention to detail.  The dancing exudes energy especially the Can Can in the Moulin Rouge.  But I think the Tango scene is where it is used to best effect. However, if you do know someone who hates musicals, this is not the film to try and convert them.In my opinion, an original, modern classic and the sort of film-making that should only be encouraged.  Superb 10/10 (Plus, if you liked this, try Singing In The Rain if you haven't already seen it.)",Moulin Rouge!
574,emswan2004,I walked out on this one.,2,10 September 2010,"I am an artist, photographer, costume designer and love most anything French... but I hated this movie. I saw a preview in Vogue of the costumes and eagerly awaited the film, but was dreadfully disappointed in it. I walked out about half-way through, as I was feeling dizzy and sick from the incessant flash-and-dash editing, and the utter silliness of it. There isn't one scene that lasted long enough for my eyes to focus on it. The mix of songs, some stolen from other musicals, were staged in a blend of people and animation, and are awful. Though I was surprised to find that Nicole can really sing, while her costar cannot.The story is taken from the real life of an actual French dancer, but what is in reality a tragedy of life cut short is here made into a comic travesty. It's a different style film than others before it, but different doesn't mean better. I give it two thumbs down. Skip it.",Moulin Rouge!

I did not want to end that first sentence with an exclamation point, but it is part of the movie title. The perplexing punctuation point in the title could be due to one or more of the following:a) It emphasizes that it should DEFINITELY(!) not be confused with the fine 1952 biopic of Toulouse-Lautrec starring José Ferrer. b) It is used as a warning, as in ""Danger!"" or ""Hazardous to Health!"" or ""Bad Movie!"" c) It is just an example of the unnecessary and worthless trappings that someone thought they could throw together and pass off as ""art"".Let me see if I can sum up this mess for you: Take a reel or two of 35mm film. Fill it with gaudy, heavy and bloated direction. Add some stomach-churning performances. Throw in a weird goulash of music. Mix it up with enough chopped up, disjointed editing as to produce vertigo,and VOILA!Motion picture motion sickness. Cinematic mal de mer. Projector projectile puke.

She was the only good thing about this movie... and she can indeed sing. She does indeed know how to act... even in an abortion like this.Ewan MacGregor... he may be the flavor of the year (from ""Trainspotting"" and ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace""), but he doesn't add anything to this movie - anybody could have filled the role.As for the rest of the cast... the less said, the better.Let's talk about the camera work... I'm surprised that more theaters didn't report cases of sea sickness during this movie... while we're all used to (by now) all those hand-held cameras that jump around, this one jumps around so much that you don't even have time to identify the player that it is focused on. It zips all over the place like a demented hedgehog, denying you a point of view to anyone.Next, the music... musicals are supposed to have music - preferably original music, though theater shows such as ""ABBA, the Musical"" (or whatever it may be called) rely on previously published tunes - not cheap recordings from an oldies station. If they had actually done full songs, that would have been one thing... but just stealing lines from various pop songs of the last 30 years? Ridiculous. Not only did they use individual lines from pop songs of years gone by, but they used the same durn lines over and over and over again... nauseating.Nicole Kidman was good... as noted, she was the only saving grace of this movie - but only if you have a really desperate Nicole Kidman fix that you need to feed. She deserves an Oscar just for putting up with this poor plot (so very over-used) and direction. She's good... but this movie isn't.

And there is that video that has nothing to do with the film that but was inspired by it... To say the least I was not expecting much.I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  Moulin Rouge is a fantastic intelligent musical fantasy that has more energy in the first 15 minutes than most films have in their entirety.

Where all the technical hoohaw and the music carried those movies along, here I thought the got in the way.  It was like a 2 hour music video, and who can love that.  Particularly at the beginning, the action was so frenetic that nothing seemed to stick.  The movie slowed down as it wound down, which let at least a couple of the characters come through to a degree, and there were lots of very clever, very funny, bits, but I never felt drawn in to the story.  My wife said it reminded her of Coppolla's Dracula, and I think that is true.  Unfortunately, Dracula was a clear confirmation that Coppolla had lost sight of what was great about his movies and had become infatuated with the technical side.  All that technical brilliance can really make a story come alive, but it cannot substitute for a story.  Hope this was just a slight lurch off the true path for Luhrman.",Moulin Rouge!

Unlike most dramas, which wallow in constant pity and remorse, Moulin Rouge has its truly exciting, fun moments, such as (SPOILERS ahead) the joyous dance scene at the end of the play.
When Sertine finally dies, the viewer feels a sense of pain, yet joy, at the fact that she died happily and with her wish come true. There could have been many alternative endings- for example, the bad guy could have shot Sertine in the middle of her joyous finale dance. The writers decided to satisfy the viewers' hopes, for a change, and I'm glad that they gave us the ending we yearned to see.

Moulin Rouge is easily so far this years best film and movie soundtrack.  The music is what makes this movie. You'll laugh during the Like A Virgin number, cry when Kidman sings One Day I'll Fly Away.  All in all, this is an extremely brilliant film.  I would say this is the best musical of all time.  Not only, musically is it a great movie, but the acting is superb.  Kidman and Broadbent are brilliant, McGregor gives an honest performance, Roxburgh is scary, and Leguizamo was decent.  Kidman and McGregor also have great singing voices.  The rest of the cast have decent voices, (except Roxburgh, but he doesn't sing much.)

Why bother?  If you ""put together"" a musical without writing any music, have you really ""put together"" a musical?  The answer is no.This is the kind of idiocy that _Oklahoma!_ displaced, where the songs are unrelated and the ""action"" and ""character"" don't even rise to the level of formality.  Only it's worse, because it specifically targets songs which are attached to your memories and butchers them.  When I saw them quote out of context the song U2 wrote to commemorate the life and death of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in an idiotic scene on the back of a big fake elephant, I almost walked out.  I should have.  It only got worse.The only way this would be even permissable would be in parody, but this is no parody.  It clearly wants to be taken at least marginally seriously, apparently without going to the trouble of having anything at all to say, unless you count the apparent reality that people are very, very stupid, are essentially devoid of any and all merit, and are not worth watching.Do not believe the hype.  Do not see this movie!  If you do see it, at least have the good sense to get really, really high first, so that, even if it takes itself seriously, you don't make the mistake of doing so.",Moulin Rouge!

587,stevenblackburn,Great!! In Places!!!!!!!!!!,3,16 January 2002,"I went to see this movie solely because of the popularity of it in reviews etc. I thought that maybe it would be a little more better than it was said to be!!!  Due to the fact that there was no storyline whatsoever or i didn't notice it it seemed like i was straining at the screen for some little glimpse of reality!!!Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman Mmmm. Two brilliant actors that i admire are seemingly lost in the middle of this pointless, operatic dribble.The best part in the film was when the credits rolled up the screen at the end!!!!3/10",Moulin Rouge!
588,nicver,What was that all about?,1,4 February 2002,"Maybe it would be a good thing to pick up people who can actually sing, for a musical, don't you think?Still wondering what was that all about.The director tried to steal from Jeunet and go ahead with the mix of elements that are supposed to create a je ne sais quoi out-of-time universe with a clumsy attempt at honoring the time of Melies, Toulouse-Lautrec, and of the Cancan. Just that it totally duds.Oh, and having these people sing modern pop classics out of sync, out of tune and out of the blue, that's so much NEVER SEEN before.At least, in a Knight's Tale, there was some action going on.",Moulin Rouge!
589,herzograven,McGregor saves the day!,5,22 April 2002,"Prior to watching Moulin Rouge! , I only heard amazing things about this movie.  However I was warned that it IS a musical, and I was not sure how well this movie was really made since I am not a fan of musicals.  As the movie begins Ewan McGregor's narration lays an impression on the viewer. The opening scene is serious and sad when McGregor is explaining what has happened.  His narration continues the movie changes rapidly into a ridiculous comedy that does not seem appealing at all.  It continues for another hour to have this great touch of a ridiculous comedy which is not funny I might add.  The first hour of the movie was completely boring and seemed very weak, however in certain scenes McGregor proved his acting ability very well and showed the audience how well he is capable to act. The story does not pick up until half way through the movie.  That is when the climax begins and the story begins to take a serious shape compared to the first half.  The second hour of the movie has many twists and turns in the sense of the complications between the two main characters.  They are caught between their love and their duties and seem to forget how badly they are tangled up in this obstacle.  Again the story changes rapidly from a ridiculous comedy into a serious romantic drama.  It continues with its more serious side until it hits the end.  The ending was not unexpected but without a doubt it can be said that it was a better ending than most recent movies that have been released.  For a regular movie person the ending would be predictable, but the overall performance near the end raises and became much better than it was at the beginning of the movie.  One has to sit through the movie in order to completely understand what is going on and in order to determine what kind of movie this is.  To come to a conclusion and give this movie a definite genre, Moulin Rouge! is a musical love story beyond any doubts, it is preformed in a comedic style as the movie opens, however it changes into a dramatic love story as it proceeds.  As a personal note I might add that this movie was no Oscar material accept Ewan McGregor's performance.  I believe that with this movie or even his prior movies he has proven that he is a great actor with great abilities.  Him being in the cast was probably the only reason that I did watch this movie. As another private note I wish to add that for the 2001 Oscar nominations if there was anyone worthy of winning the `Beat Actor of the Year' award it would have been McGregor rather than Denzel Washington for `Training Day'. This once again proves that the Oscars are not concerned with ART in movies but rather larger box office digits.  One last statement that I want to close this off with; this movie is not for everyone, you have to sit through a lot of senseless material in order to get through this and it will not be easy (I warn you now!).  As I mentioned it before, if this movie has one strong element to it then it was Ewan McGregor, In other words, McGregor saves this movie from being `very bad' to `okay'.",Moulin Rouge!
590,scifisuede,Get ready for a spectacular journey...,10,2 January 2005,"If you're in love, this is the ultimate film for you. This is an emotional ride, not the kind you should watch with frowned foreheads trying to analyse it; but the kind you should watch with a light heart and an open mind. The whole film feels exactly like how the world looks when you're in love - everything's so dream-like, fabulous, spectacular, emotional.It's just utterly entertaining! It's touching at one time, funny at another....Firstly, the music is GREAT - there are the likes of David Bowie, Rufus Wainwright, Beck, Alka Yagnik... even just listening to the soundtrack CD alone is an ultimate emotional ride enough. Visually, the cinematography, costumes, sets, and choreography are just stunning. They work great as a whole and resulting in a dramatic eye candy. The plot, although simple, WORKS.So sit back, dim your lights, unplug your phones - and get ready for a fantastical, romantic 'dream' that is Moulin Rouge.",Moulin Rouge!
591,Shippey,Bravo! Baz Luhrmann's best!,8,31 May 2001,"On a better note, I went to a screening of Moulin Rouge last Tuesday evening. For the non-epileptic among you, I heartily recommend this one! It starts in a nearly cartoon fashion, then it segues into a bizarre fusion of traditional musical theatre and music video, an acid trip through Name That Tune. The cinematic stagings include some over-the-top pieces such as an all male rendition of Madonna's paean, Like a Virgin. This is a fantasy as ever as Andrew Lloyd Webber saw drama, and if you can be mesmerized by a Technicolor Dreamcoat, Baz Luhrmann's rather joyous answer to Aronofsky's not-so Requiem for a Dream will sweep you to a place you probably have never been: into an applauding hoi polloi of post-modern distinction. After the mind-numbing disaster that is Pearl Harbor, this film salvages the summer for me.",Moulin Rouge!
592,Glida,"A tale full of sound and fury, but two hours worth?",4,2 June 2001,"I can certainly give Baz Luhrmann credit for defying, or perhaps more accurately, reinventing convention in his stylistically bold approach to this partial revival of the MGM Technicolor musical cum 2 hour rock video, unfortunately monikered Moulin Rouge.  Certainly, there is a lot energy and vitality in this production, and much like his previous work, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, seems to address the teen audience (although this one seems particularly targeted to adolescent females roughly between the ages of 14 - 17).   The film, starring Nicole Kidman and Ewen MacGregor with good supporting work by Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo, and Richard Roxburgh, chronicles the happenings of a gorgeous courtesan named Satine (Kidman) whom we discover early in the film has contracted consumption.  She falls in love with a struggling young writer who becomes involved with the production after a piece of broad comedy that both misses its artistic mark and him as one of the members of the upcoming ""Spectacular Spectacular"" cast literally falls through the ceiling into his apartment.  Naturally, the writer is a hopeless romantic, the courtesan is incapable of love until she meets the writer, there's an evil capitalistic Duke (Roxburgh), with whom Satine must liaison to keep the show from closing, while the kind, fatherly director (Broadbent) tries to bring some wisdom and common sense to all, etc., etc.,etc. Meanwhile there are over-long production numbers that quote old show tunes (""The Sound of Music"") as well as more current material (Elton John and Madonna) in a mix that possesses a certain amount of quirky charm but never really jells into anything of substance.  This is a film about effect, with art direction that struggles hard to overwhelm the audience ever harder at every turn.  Roger Ebert gave this film a positive review, which I am not, but he did make the point that watching this film is like being stuck on an elevator with a circus......I think he had a point.  Certainly, the editing flies so fast and furiously at some points that I was tempted to stop an usher for an airplane bag. This was an effort that cried out for relief from a lower pitch to allow the characters the chance to breathe and be, as well establish some sense of reality.  Instead, we are forced to deal with types stuck in a high-tech largely formulaic melodrama that is so stuck in its formula that it really makes no attempt to connect with the audience on a more authentic level.  As a result, there really is no glue to hold this enterprise together, and what we get is two hours of artifice without soul. I must confess that I was bothered by the title, since the original film of the same name was a great film with such wonderful style and performances. I wanted a warning label like:  ""Be advised to lower your expectations from the original film -otherwise, your subsequent disappointment might be harmful to your health."" I might have hoped for some ironic quirks to relieve the film from its self seriousness, like having John Cusak revive his role from Bullets Over Broadway to play the struggling young writer, or Terry Gilliam to introduce a cartoon sequence.  Well, I kid, but don't kid yourself that this movie is anything like worth 2 hours of your time.  ** from me on this one.",Moulin Rouge!
593,edcguy,Poubelle,1,4 June 2001,"Bleh. What a load of technicolour bull-crap. An overdone-to-death little love story stretched out into a massive production of instantly forgettable song & dance routines. Nicole Kidman is about as sexy as a dead fish wrapped in newspaper and Ewan McGregor's singing left dogs howling outside the cinema. The sets, makeup, and costumes were visually obnoxious, and the music could only be possibly enjoyed by the same type of morons who listen to all '80's radio.",Moulin Rouge!

595,keiths29,Pretentiousness is often confused for greatness.,5,3 June 2001,"I will admit Moulin Rouge is visually stunning, but beyond yet it can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, musical or melodrama.  The first half of the movie is filmed at a frenetic pace.  The style is a cross between Tim Burton and Spike Jonze on speed.  It had all the drama of an hour-long music video (the Smashing Pumpkins did it better).  The characters are cartoonish and too slapstick.  The second half of the movie plays better, but it left me wondering why the whole movie wasn't treated as a serious love story. The usually entertaining John Leguizamo's Toulouse Lautrec is Three Stooges in its depth.Moulin Rouge is better suited for the Broadway stage, then for the movie screen. Ewan McGregor does hold his own, unlike Antonio Banderas in Evita (or who could forget Oliver Reed in Tommy) and Nicole Kidman is absolutely beautiful.  Even these great performances can't rescue Moulin Rouge.  Too often avant-garde is synonymous with greatness.  The audience I saw this movie with was bored.",Moulin Rouge!

It's simple and predictable, just the way you would expect.  Of course, no one looks at the plot for this movie when there's all that music..  had I seen this in the theatre I'd totally have walked out.  the whole level of maturity of everything going on just seemed way too toned down... the cartoon sound effects that happened all the time were picking at my nerves, ewan mcgregor's plastic smile and singing voice were bugging as well, just about every character in this movie is engineered to annoy, ya this movie was not for me.  if you're looking for some deep thoughtful meaning, this movie is as far as you can get from that.  if you want a trite love story and some redone music, come right over.  i'd give this a 1 out of 10, but they put so much work in it that it must deserve a 4.

599,redrum_9,A Total Disaster,1,26 September 2009,"This must be the most overrated film I came across on IMDb yet. If you look at the user rating statistics, you can see that most people voted it 10. Also, can be seen the average rating for male voters is 7.5 (as of the day I write this review). This is clearly a film that is usually more appealing to female viewers, and why is it that if only males voted for this it would still get a great rating, is beyond me.This film is not only a total atrocity, but an opportunity missed to make a visually beautiful film with great songs and performances.I have to say I'm a male, but the reasons why I dislike this film is not because of that.The editing is absolutely terrible. CUT CUT CUT CUT CUT CUT. About 20 minutes in the film I started counting how often is there a cut (which is already a sign that I waited for the film to be over). There is a cut every 2-3 seconds in average. You barely can follow what is going on. You just see faces pop up on the screen. There is even a scene where you see the building of the Moulin Rouge for a second. It just pops up, you don't know why. That shows that the whole editing of this film is a mess. The director employed this quick editing for the movie to be stylish, but it just failed.The acting and the character development are disastrous. Nicole Kidman looks gorgeous as always, but that's it. Both her's and McGregor's acting is extremely forced and unnatural. Also, I don't see why I should care about the characters, if the director doesn't care about developing them. What we know about the two main characters is that they LOVE each other. Everything else is unimportant. The creators thought that the love and chemistry between McGregor's and Kidman's character will be so strong and powerful that it will blow us away, and then they can do ANYTHING on screen we won't notice. NO. You don't care if a plane crashes in the Moulin Rouge, and all the characters die, because you don't care about them.The visual style. A huge fail again. The whole thing tries to have it's own unique and beautiful visual style, but it just isn't impressing at all. The whole film seems like it's on a set, and maybe that was intentional, but in doesn't work anyway.Ridiculously clichéd dialogues and story. The word LOVE is used in every sentence, there are monologues about LOVE, Ewan McGregor is a troubled writer who LOVEd someone, and writes a story about LOVE, and the whole film is about LOVE, ....... NO, enough!The interesting thing is that all the points cited above have one thing in common (apart form that they are all negative). The quick cut-cut-cut editing, the forced and cheesy acting, the wanna look cool visual style, the 'they've done this story a hundred times before but I'll show that I'll do it the best' comes down to this: the director wants us to believe that this is great by those things. It wants to shows that this is a unique and powerful film. No, it's not. It's a bad bad bad film. Of course, it's got to be said that this is a musical, and you can still like the songs. If that is the case buy the soundtrack, but don't waste your time watching this atrocity. And the fact that it won 2 Oscars, shows the true quality of these awards.",Moulin Rouge!
600,KatieBug19,An Energy and Charisma not usually seen in main-stream film ...,9,28 May 2002,"The weekend prior to the Academy Awards, I decided I could avoid it no longer, and I rented ""Moulin Rouge!""  As a devotee of classic musicals, I thought I would be offended and disappointed by a film that destroyed their legacy rather than honoring or bettering it.  Boy, was I ever wrong! From the opening seconds of the film, I was shocked, dazzled and inspired. As I have since learned, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice (with a large chunk of appreciation due to ""Camille"") served as the source material for this unbelievable piece of showmanship.  Each shot (and they are seemingly endless) was carefully planned, is part of both story and atmosphere and is unlike practically anything else produced today.  Each member of the cast is wonderful, maintaining the perfect balance between melodrama and true passion/emotion, all with this fantastic self-awareness.  ""Moulin Rouge!"" performs for the viewer, asking at each turn whether he/she is satisfied. Lines, songs, costumes: they all change the ultimate outcome of the story, but if you are unsatisfied, wait just a few minutes, and they will change it again, aware of their power and yet free of pretension.  No comments on this movie would be complete without a word about the magnificent singing voices of those involved.  When Ewan McGregor pops up with ""The hills are alive ... "" and later ""My gift is my song ... "" my mouth dropped open.  And Nicole Kidman, descending on that trapeze murmuring ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" - I almost applauded.  This IS what musicals are all about: Spectacular, Spectacular!And so somehow, this film works.  It works and it laughs at the cynic who thought it would fail.After the first hour, I was ready to change my Oscar predictions. How could something of this magnitude be ignored?  Yes, it is gaudy and garish. Yes, the actors do spontaneously burst into song and dance about.  Yes, Baz was more than a little obnoxious in interviews in the weeks before.  But isn't that the point?  Unfortunately, Oscar voters would like to distance themselves from their craft.  On ""the big night,"" they seem to desire that which is safe, that which is normal, that which is mundane.  ""Moulin Rouge!"" is none of these; and although my first predictions of its success were wrong, I feel positive that this film will survive and entertain as long as people are interested in intelligent, stimulating art.",Moulin Rouge!

OK I found the initial run of song routines a little trying, but the movie dragged me along and just got better and better.

I agree with a previous comment that said something to the effect that this movie has all the Romeo + Juliet had and more. Well, I didn't care for Romeo + Juliet either. If I want an assault on my senses I'll go the amusment park and ride the roller coaster. I rented Moulin Rouge because I really wanted to see what all the hype was about. The first half, the faster paced half, had me almost gagging...but then it got better. I actually could tolerate the second half. Was I impressed with the music? No. (Lady Marmalade at the end made me want to puke!) Was I impressed with Nicole Kidman? No, she grated on my nerves. Was I impressed with Ewan McGregor? More so than with either of the previous aspects. I can't be accused of not likeing it because it was ""different"" either...Memento was different and I enjoyed it much more the Moulin Rouge.

Let me explain why.Do you know what I mean when I say there are some movies that just knock you backwards with delight and surprise the first time you see them. The impact is even more powerful if you don't know anything about the film before you sit down to watch it. Well, for me, Moulin Rouge is just such a movie, and a great example of entertaining cinematography at its very best. I'm not going to say anything about the plot; nor am I going to give you any clue as to what journey of delight the director will lead you on. You will just have to read these few key words and see if you like the idea in general: love, Paris, jealousy, words, theater, Sound of Music, tragedy, humor, an elephant, dance, a Duke, music and colors.So? What do you think? Willing to give it a try? But be warned: there's no action scenes; no exciting shoot out; no cops; no mafia, no car chase and no blood and guts. Boring you may say? Well if that lot is a must for any movie you watch then you can forget Moulin Rouge.Still interested? Great. Go away, find the DVD or download it, and get ready for a delightful couple of hours.This is a film that many consider a 'cult movie' of a kind. It might not be a perfect, clinical production but I promise you that all its flaws just add to the charm. There is a very good chance you will want to see it over and over so as to catch the myriad points of detailed set design and actions by the supporting cast. And the music is great. It shows what two 'non-singer' actors can do in very demanding musical roles. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGegor are both fantastic.Oh, yes, a word of warning: don't be scared off by the first 10 minutes - trust the director.

So imagine yourself how surprised I was, when i understood that the music had actually touched me...It actually did...And the story, itself, touched me as well.

609,sbsyd207,"Come what may, I'll love this movie until my dying day!",10,19 June 2005,"In a world of complicated concepts and unfamiliar ways of life one familiar concept is handed to us on a silver platter. Love. To the English writer called Christian love is like oxygen. Love is a many splendered thing. Love lifts us up where we belong. All you need is love! One problem. He's never been in love. And so the journey at the Moulin Rouge begins. And in a wave of familiar lyrical songs and laugh-out-loud jokes, you watch as a young, sensitive, handsome, penniless writer falls for a clever, sexy, Cortesan called Satine. It seems as though the only thing the two have in common is there singing talents and there desire for something greater. But things start to get a little more complicated than Christian thought when Satine is sold to the Duke in exchange for investments on their new play, and when Satine becomes deathly ill. What was a sweet and lighthearted romance turns into a desperate race for Satine's love, and overwhelming jealousy and a sense of ownership create a power on screen that becomes heart wrenching. Baz delivers a few powerful renditions of modern songs and delivered lines that make the audience gasp. Such as the scene where the Duke asks why the Cortesan shouldn't fall in love with the Maharajah. In an angry and frustrated rage Christian screams out ""BECAUSE SHE DOESN""T LOVE YOU!"" Sending further suspicion that Christian and Satine are in love. The daring casting of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give it an extra leap of faith that proves to be ""Spectacular!"" And the unexpected romantic aspects have ever female viewer in tears. But an extreme in opinion shows a serious viewing issue. Many who are spontaneous, passionate, and artistic will love this. The combination of the passionate love story, the wonderful music and art direction and the character's want of something greater is gripping. But the viewer has to be very opened minded. This film is a breakthrough in musicals. But is slightly odd. The plot has the kind of feel of Pretty Woman, but much more artistic. All in all, this is a great romantic passionate, art driven movie. Baz made moves in this film that no one has ever seen done. Yet it's captivating and emotionally driven and sends you to a place you can only go to in the movies.",Moulin Rouge!

The storyline alone was amazing, but to add songs to it, it made it spectacular! The mix of music and the passion between Satine and Christian made this movie so unpredictable. The passionate romance between the two leads was a beautiful thing, that did not seem like acting at all! Christian was an amazing idea of a hopeless romantic. He is funny & is obsessed with love. I loved how the play inside the movie reflected him. Ewan is such a talented singer, so I say whoever made this cast is pure genius.",Moulin Rouge!
611,JulietV,A Tasty Treat for the Eyes,10,12 June 2001,"The plot was a little thin, and they could have showed more dancing.  But the rest of the movie was so utterly and completely perfect, it made up for everything.  I assume the critics are saying ""Visually Spectacular"" and that is exactly what it is.  Not to mention that both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have really lovely voices, which is a surprise, too.  Very humorous, having the cast sing modern pop songs.  And at times, hilarious.

I have to admit to not being a great fan of musicals made after the 1950's. However I rented the video last night to see what all the fuss was about. IT WAS AWFUL. The editing was so disjointed as to make the plot (Ha Ha) impossible to find let alone follow. The acting was poor, the siging worse and the choice of music bizarre. I really cannot understand how this film could be nominated for oscars and other awards. I can usually find something good to say about a film but not this one. I gave it one out of ten because there isn't a zero.",Moulin Rouge!
614,jack_1981,excellent on all counts,10,25 May 2001,"This review may contain what people call spoilers. Though I wouldn't be wary, they're not major.- - - 'Spectacular! Spectacular!' is the name of the theatrical production the team of Moulin Rouge are trying to make in the movie. And boy, is it ever! I think I can quite clearly say that Moulin Rouge is my favourite movie... indeed. Everything from the wonderfully directed opening 30 minutes (diamond's that smell like lady marmalade are a can-can girls best friend) to the tragically sad ending (yes, I am not ashamed to say that I cried!)The songs are brilliant, colourful and everything you'd expect from a Baz Luhrmann movie. Ewan and Nicole are really good singers. And the scene where Jim Broadbent & Richard Roxburgh sing ""Like A Virgin"" to each other is a crack up! I have never been to a movie where the audience clapped. I can now say I have. Everyone in the cinema (about 300) clapped after the 'spectacular! spectacular!' pitch (which is hilarious,) after the elephant love medley, after the ""Like A Virgin"" scene and after the finale song. And then after the song everyone cried because of the ending.But damn, is this movie funny. John Leguizamo (sp?) as the dwarfed man dressed like nun (you'll get that once you've seen the movie)The special effects are great, to show the bohemian absinth (sp?) soaked Monmatre in 1899. Oh, another highlight! Kylie Minogue as the green fairy singing ""The Hills Are Alive With The Sound Of Music"" she appears as a drunken halucination from a bottle of tequila... and it is funny as hell.Mouling Rouge deserves at least 4 oscars. Best actress (for the fabulour Nicole, of coarse,) Best Costume Design, Best Cinematography and best set design. And a nod to best song. I think there was an original one in there somewhere.See this movie, you [probably] wont regret it.A+ / 10/10Now, obviously this isn't going to appeal to everyone, but... see it, it truly is like nothing you have ever seen before!",Moulin Rouge!

Had to pause it and do something else now and then. But, I did manage to finish, and even though I don't like to admit it, i have to: Moulin rouge! is a very good movie. At least, that's how I felt after it was over. I loathed the singing bits while they occured, but looking back.... If this is not your kind of movie, chances are you will dislike it. But regardless, it may be worth a look.",Moulin Rouge!
617,modern_maiden,Missed the mark.,4,1 April 2003,"I love musicals. I love Nicole Kidman. I love Ewan McGregor. But in my opinion this film was a dull let-down.Why was I so disappointed?For a film that literally cries out for extravagant dance numbers, this film merely had a lot of action that through trick editing was merely *pretending* to be extravagant dance numbers. The scenes switch so quickly that you can never really see anyone truly dance, probably because they're not truly dancing. The exception is the final dance number where the Argentinian and one of the ladies tango and re-enact the lovers' story. However, that episode is so long drawn out and full of triteness that it becomes tedious.On the subject of editing, I felt that the editing failed to provide the awe, energy and pizzazz that some of the dance numbers required. It left the actors looking awkward and ridiculous in parts, in particular the scene in which the group is demonstrating the ideas for the new show to the Baron.Although Nicole Kidman is beautiful and talented, I didn't think she was warm and sensual enough for the role of Satine, and although she's not a ""bad"" singer, I felt that most of her big songs lacked the ""oomph"" required to give proper effect.Overall, the feel of the film was very juvenile. I felt like the director was ""dumbing down"" the sophistication of what should/could have been a smart, naughty story about love, lust, envy and greed in the underworld. Instead, it felt sanitized, and because of that became nothing more than a typical Hollywood date movie in lingerie.But the most painful of all were the dialog and the music. 90% of the film steals lines from contemporary pop music. And the lines are so brief and ecclectic it had me feeling like it was targeted towards people with Attention Deficit Disorder. I can only guess that it was an attempt to appeal to the masses -- and since I'm one of the few who didn't like this film, I guess it succeeded in that regard. Clever appropriation of well known music and words can be very effective, but in my opinion ""Moulin Rouge!"" missed the mark, choosing to totally saturate the film with line after line of quotes from mainstream pop music...not even something cleverly obscure, only the most obvious and mainstream so that the most unworldly of viewers was likely to ""get it"". I found myself thinking ""If they utter one more quote from Elton John I'm going to puke!"".So what did I love about the film?The costumes and sets were fun, fantastical and lush. They created a magical atmosphere that promised more than the rest of the film could deliver.And Ewan McGregor was by far the shining star of the film. He's a strong singer and absolutely brilliant actor. Too bad his performance couldn't eclipse the rest of the film's shortcomings for me.In summary, it's a cute film, great for a family with kids, but don't expect anything too deep or original. Sadly, it suffers from ""over-Hollywoodization"". It's just too corny and trite.",Moulin Rouge!

I've never been a fan of Broadway or any sort of showtunes whatsoever.  When you've dated someone who used to sing them 24-7, maybe you willingly begin to despise them;  Call me close-minded, but I assumed this film would be along those lines, and during the opening scene, I was almost blown away.  I have never seen a movie like this in my entire life - and praise to Baz for having the cajones to make this film, he deserves an Oscar for it.  The acting was superb, and who knew Nicole and Ewan could even sing?

621,kevin_blaze,Silly Love Songs Hit A Home Run!!!,10,7 January 2002,"30 Second Bottom Line: A struggling writer falls in love with a nightclub singer/dancer/courtesan and becomes thwarted in developing the relationship by the desires of a powerful and wealthy man holding the title of Duke, and ultimately by her illness.Moulin Rouge is not simply a film, but rather a fantastical affair filled with music, drama, action, and most importantly, love. Moulin Rouge allows you to take a trip to the 19th century Paris hot spot for the price of a movie ticket. It's a musical play set with the stage background reminiscent of The Grinch. for adults. That is to say we see real people against a fairy tale backdrop, performing nearly impossible stunts to the tune of contemporary pop music. Although the story takes place in the arty section of Paris known is Mormantre, it was filmed entirely down under in Australia. The costumes are wonderful, just as they were when we saw Jim Broadbent in Topsy Turvy. In that film, the setting, costumes and music were 19th century. Here, the setting is 19th century, yet the music spans the last 30 years; with songs you will recognize such as Like a Virgin, Rhythm of the Night, Material Girl and Lady Marmalade. It may sound crazy, but director Luhrmann brings it all together just as he did with Strictly Ballroom.
Usually clichés make me groan, but in this case, they fit in perfectly. The phrases from popular songs are used in the dialogue as the characters are speaking to one another and it sounds like a funny type of Shakespeare where you really know what they are talking about. It's also hilarious to listen to because it's like talking to someone with bits and pieces of songs that you've heard a thousand times.Over the top, energetic and extravagant musical numbers, as well as tender solos make Moulin Rouge soar. When Lady Marmalade was being done, I'm sure that although Patti Labelle was not on the screen, she would be proud of what they did with her song. It's somewhat like Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis singing Cruisin in the film Duets. They sounded great and would give the man himself, Smokey Robinson, a run for his money on its performance. Who would have thought that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor can sing well enough to make you want to buy the CD?! Elton John says, regarding Ewan's performance of Your Song, ""This guy sings this song better than I sing it."" Word is that Ewan is working on getting a recording contract. I think it will happen.he's that good!Moulin Rouge is a spectacle that keeps you breathless because it moves so fast. You see so much, you hear so much and you think so much about the story and its eccentric characters that you can't help but enjoy so much. There are at least three or four times I had to restrain myself from applauding after a musical number. This is one film that deserves a standing ovation.Message: Life is nothing without true love.As the conclusion this movie is really the best musical movie of Year 2001 and you would feel sorry yourself if you do actually miss this elegant and vivid masterpiece from Baz Luhrmann!!!",Moulin Rouge!
622,scarlet caulfield,Wow!,10,18 February 2002,"When I walked out of the theater after seeing Moulin Rouge for the first time I was speechless.  It took days for all I had just seen to sink in.  I saw it two more times in the theaters and walked away always craving more. This film just ""woke me up"" so to speak and rejuvenated my spirits which were crushed by the mass-produced monotonous films of the season.Baz Luhrmann is a visual genius.  He decided that he was going to spend millions of dollars making a lavish, all out, decadent, artistic musical experience.  He could have spent this money making the next hallow Schwarzenegger film, but instead he decided to go out on a limb and a masterpiece was the final product.Some people have argued that this film merely shows glitz and glamour over substance, but I disagree.  As he did with his version of Romeo and Juliet, Luhrmann has a way of using visual brilliance and music to convey emotions that could never be done with conventional filmmaking.  The extraordinary artists, designers, and editors are the stars of the film, but the performers, especially Kidman, McGregor, and Broadbent steal the show.The songs are incredible too.  Only Luhrmann could combine Nirvana, Queen, Elton John and other pop figures into one giant montage of artistic vision. It feels as though the songs were written for the movie, as they work perfectly with each scene, and the stars can sing beautifully too!This film is a work of love.  It is obvious that everyone who was involved with the picture took it to heart.  The story I'll admit is not original - in fact it's very similar to Romeo and Juliet, a story which has been beaten to the ground at this point.  But the film is still very original as it takes the feelings and emotions of love and splashes them across the screen in every scene.  In the first half of the film we see the mystical world of Bohemia through the eyes of Christian who is in love.  Much like in Romeo and Juliet, during the second half the mood changes leading up to an emotional climax.However, it is when he is in love that Bohemia sparkles, showing how love can change everything.  This film is essentially a tribute to the power of love to change one's world.I suggest that you watch this film with an open mind and an open heart, and just let yourself fall into this irrational glittering world of Bohemia during the ""summer of love.""  You too will fall in love with Luhrmann's style, trust me.",Moulin Rouge!

Jim Broadbent especially, with his f**king ugly face filling the entire screen through many moments.I think this film is just horrid, horrid, horrid.

I can get why people like this film, though I thought there was too much style over substance. I thought Nicole Kidman was pretty bad in this movie, was annoying, and did not deserve her Oscar nomination. Though I thought Ewan McGregor was good as usual. The costume design and production design was really great. I thought the editing was abysmal and cinematography was pretty strange. Jim Broadbent's performance was pretty good though campy and Richard Roxburgh's performance as The Duke was in my opinion no very good and way too goofy. The love story it's self is okay but nothing special. Ewan McGregor's sidekick or whether were very weird and unnecessary. The singing was really good and I did really like how they mashed up different songs. The movie was so weirdly paced for me, that it ended up feeling almost tiresome.

626,the_prince_of_frogs,Watching once was too much,1,19 September 2017,"I can not believe that anyone or anything in Moulin Rouge! was nominated for an Academy Award much less won any. I have seen better acting, song and dance in a third grade play. I saw no talent in the entire movie. I think Nicole Kidman was wasted in this movie. Kidman has talent but I saw none in Moulin Rouge! unless it was Kidman's talent to not puke all though the movie. I think the attempts at singing by the cast are failures. To me it sounded more like screaming. A great musical is The Sound of Music (1965) as this movie displays real talent and enjoyable performances that include musical numbers, drama, romance and a great plot. Mary Poppins (1964) is another great musical. I consider Lady and the Tramp (1955) to be a much more accomplished movie and musical than Moulin Rouge! To get past the awful taste and mood that Moulin Rouge! left me with I will watch Cabaret (1972) or one of the other great musical movies I named. Finally I will say that I do not consider Moulin Rouge! to be any form of entertainment.",Moulin Rouge!

628,GillianS,Lacks originality...,6,31 May 2001,"While I enjoyed this movie as an overall pleasurable movie-going experience, I left feeling that it lacked something.  Of course, it was visually spectacular; the scenery and the dance numbers provided something of a sensory overload.  Nicole Kidman was beautiful, though her tragic part was rather cliche, as was the whole story.  Anyone ever hear of La Boheme? or Cabaret? Put them together and you have Moulin Rouge.  Don't get me wrong, both have terrific stories, but did we really need them to be re-hashed, with new songs?  I think not.  I would recommend this movie purely for the visual value and performance numbers, but certainly not if you seek something original with a plot that will leave any impression at all.",Moulin Rouge!

When plot, picture, & performance are at their best, the result is excellence.  Such is the case with Moulin Rouge!  I will admit the plot could have been stronger, but then again, if it had been more complex, it may have been too much for filmgoers to take. After all, an audience is asked to withstand power punch camera shots (I would have hated to be the editor on this one), bizarre musical concepts, quirky characters, etc. throughout the film.  Plot weakness aside, the performances more than make up for it.  And the picture quality (artistic set design, directing, cinematography) is the best I've ever seen.  This is a film people will recognize in years to come as one that set a new standard and opened doors for future filmmakers to fulfill their creative senses. BRILLIANCE!

630,hermes-10,mixed feelings,6,25 February 2002,"What I liked: visually the movie is gorgeous. The sets are great, so are the costumes. The colors are beautiful. I also liked much of the music. I appreciated the joke of using late 20th century popular tunes in a movie set in 1900. The two principal actors (Nicole and Ewan) sing amazingly well.What I did not like: First of all the story. Was this the one-millionth love story? Will he get her, will she get him? Who cares? This type of story has been told so often in books and movies. Then the over-acting: the Duke and the Moulin Rouge's director over-acted heavily, making their scenes unrealistic. The other actors over-acted a bit too. Maybe the over-acting was intentional - it fits the type of acting that was practiced around 1900. Still I don't like it.Overall a 6.5 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!

Baz Luhrman is this man - although we should not forget his fantastic crew and talented production heads (as well as focus-puller). It goes to show that even in way down-under in Australia (I am half-Australian), far, far from Hollywood, it is possible to do world-class imaginative features, developed, produced, and edited in Australia (Lord of the Rings supports the same supposition in New Zeland). Nicole Kidman is brilliant, as is the set design and the costumes.

Moulin Rouge! is so spectacular that it is just awe inspiring. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's performances cap off a fabulous all round performance from the ensemble cast.

As time went on, I discovered that it was actually a musical and that they would be using modern-type songs. At that point, I was severely concerned for the well-being of the filmmakers, but I still hadn't seen the movie, so I couldn't exactly pass judgement. About a week ago, I finally broke down and saw it. I went into it knowing I was going to be completely weirded out, but I didn't know I was going to laugh as much as I did. What a wonderful movie. It's such a great mix of humor, romance, action, music, and COLOR! OH, the COLORS! I don't think there is anything about this movie that I was disappointed with. Mind you, Moulin Rouge is not a movie for everyone. After checking out the reviews here, it's plain to see that people either loved it or hated it, in general. I am one of those who LOVED it. It's a movie that will stay with me for a long time. If you still have yet to see it, however, SEE IT IN THE THEATERS, if at all possible. This kind of brilliance deserves to be viewed on the big screen, I fear a small screen will not be able to do it justice.",Moulin Rouge!
635,Greg Lord,A post-modern masterpiece,10,22 November 2001,"`The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love & be loved in return': so begins `Moulin Rouge' as penniless Parisien writer & hopeless romantic Christian (McGregor) types & reads out the story as it at the same time unfolds before us. `My writing was interrupted' (he types & reads, & I paraphrase) `when an unconcious Argentinian fell through the roof' (cue said precipitation) `and a dwarf dressed as a nun ran into the room' (which he did). Thus the scene is set for an audacious, dazzling, deconstructed & reconstructed, exhilarating romp of a film: a romantic tragedy, a musical that is at the same time old & new, as much an homage to times past as it is a herald of the 21st century.It turns out that the 2 intruders (Koman as the narcoleptic Argentinian & Leguizamo as the painter Toulouse-Lautrec) were rehearsing a play called `Spectacular Spectacular' (itself a good description of the film, 1 of several play-within-a-play self-references), which Christian is promptly drafted in to rewrite. The play is to be shown at a can-can cabaret theatre, the `Moulin Rouge', where Christian meets & falls in love with the star turn, lady of dubious virtue & struggling wannabe Satine (Kidman). She's a Material Girl' who apparently will do anything for money & for the furtherance of her career, & who is attempting to seduce a rich Duke (Roxburgh) to that end. Christian attempts to turn her with nothing to offer but his undying love & a beautiful singing voice. Can he save the girl & win her heart from the cold evil Duke & his money? Will love save the day? The outcome isn't hard to guess  not least because it's announced in the opening scene  but then it isn't meant to be; this is not your average run-of-the-mill movie.  Visually this is absolutely stunning  the sets & costumes are impossibly colourful, lavish & detailed, the choreography inspired. The cinematography textbook has been thrown out here; the camera seems to have a life of it's own, panning & zooming manically, making a mockery of normal concepts of time & space, & giving us many post-modern sight gags along the way.The cast is superb: McGregor to my mind is one of the finest actors to emerge out of Britain in recent years, & Kidman fully justifies her star billing. Broadbent, Roxburgh, Leguizamo & Koman give excellent support with really strong performances, & there's a great little cameo from Kylie Minogue as an Absinthe Fairy'. There are moments too of great theatrical power, chief of which to my mind (along with the climax) is the moment when Christian accidentally gives the game away to the Duke about his Hamletesque play-within-a-play; a really powerful scene. The film exudes an intoxicating energy from the opening scene to the stunning denouement, & is in turns exciting, uplifting, inspiring, energising, clever, funny, surreal, & profoundly moving. The music itself is superb, & ranges from turn of the century vaudeville to Fat Boy Slim, Christina Aguilera & the queens of hip-hop, stopping along the way for opera, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Bollywood, The Beatles, T Rex, Bowie, Madonna, Nirvana, U2 & Beck  among many many others; the original music also is excellent. This is a music lover's paradise! Surpassing even the variety & quantity of the music is how it is used: often completely disparate types of music are meshed together seamlessly in a way that is clever, witty, highly original & simply exhilarating. For instance: a can-can type number sung by the Moulin Rouge cast alternates with the audience singing back lines from Nirvana's `Smells Like Teen Spirit': `here we are now, entertain us' etc.; Christian eventually wins over Satine in a conversation come musical duel comprised almost entirely of lines from pop songs  brilliantly imaginative & witty. The viewer is constantly surprised with the ever-changing musical landscape & at a time when so many films are extremely predictable for this alone `Moulin Rouge' deserves high praise.The quality of the music is also outstanding, not in the least due to the vocal performances of the stars themselves. Kidman holds a tune extremely well & combines beautifully with McGregor - who is simply magnificent. His is a voice of such control, range, power, tone & expression that it is the equal of his considerable acting talent. His rendition of Elton John's `Your Song' is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a long time. Jim Broadbent, playing the theatre owner, adds his stentorian baritone, while Koman growls his way magnificently through a version of The Police's `Roxanne'  in duet with McGregor & a tango  - that simply has to be heard to be believed. `Moulin Rouge' is a truly modern musical; Luhrman has taken hold of an old & cliched genre, injected it knowingly with 21st Century irony, imbued it with great energy, imagination & talent; & has produced a post-modern masterpiece, one of the most audacious & original films seen in a very long time - & one for which he deserves every success. After all, to quote Christian & Satine (& Paul McCartney), `Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs  and what's wrong with that, I'd like to know?', & surely making love not war' has never been more appropriate than it is now. Love it or loath it - & you're sure to do one or the other  for any lover of film this is compulsory viewing.Me? I've fallen in love.   RATING: 10",Moulin Rouge!
636,wgreid,Cool !,8,25 February 2002,I wouldn't sit through a musical if my life depended on it but this floored me. Ewan MacGregor is cool and Nicole is enchanting.  This was a pleasant surprise and I confess that I would consider watching it again.  The music is cool.  What a great idea to use popular songs from our own culture.  I'm still not going to see The Lion King !,Moulin Rouge!
637,eric.hermans,Style over substance,2,23 November 2004,"After 2 minutes into this movie we know we will have to totally suspend our belief, ignore the actors and just let the cameraman and editor get on with it. However after 5 minutes just like after eating a big fat cream pie we've had enough and we wish that there will be period whereby the story will take over just like in any good musical.No such luck we're dealing with a director who is very keen in showing us how much references he can squeeze into one movie. The actors don't help very much either. Whispering Nicole Kidman can't avoid looking like a porcelain doll, Ewan McGregor again doesn't seem to care very much (has he ever performed well in a big budget movie?) and the Toulouse Lautrec character might as well be a prop in a porn movie.The love message is hammered into our heads towards the end, as if we shouldn't complain, it's a love story after all, shucks. The last half hour is one long wait for Nicole to die. Let's hope there isn't a Moulin Rouge 2 where her daughter shows up in a fake New York with moody clouds, a token Andy Warhol and a struggling poet who can compose hip-hop songs.",Moulin Rouge!
638,chuckydorn,WOW!!,10,28 January 2002,Not having enjoyed Baz's Romeo and Juliet I was blown away by how wonderful of a job that he did on this. What a great film and what a great pair for the lead roles. Nicole Kidmann (always timeless and ALWAYS beautiful) and Ewan McGregor do such a great job playing opposite of one another one actually believes that they are totally in love. Being a huge fan of anything with romance and tragedy I was left in awe at the end of the movie. If this doesn't win best picture this year than we know the Oscars are rigged. I also loved the use of music in this movie (though it was obviously cliché). It was so well used to carry the story and not to promote the musicians that it made it interesting to listen to as well as watch. Like I said before... WOW!!,Moulin Rouge!
639,Rod-88,Creative Misfire,6,23 February 2002,"What a weird movie.  It's like `The Wizard of OZ' on drugs.  Baz Luhrmann, co-writer and director, and Craig Pearce, co-writer, have created an utterly, decadent fantasy that pushes the envelope of the imagination.  This movie is a testament that there are no boundaries when making a movie these days.  The computer-generated images of the Moulin Rouge and Paris in 1900 are fascinating.  The camera shots that seem to have no seams, zoom through the city, and come to a close-up of an actor are great.  
However, I can't say I enjoyed `Moulin Rouge' that much.  It just seemed way too busy, and it could have been better without all of the silliness.  The love story that is central in the plot, was, in fact, interesting and touching, but unfortunately there are too many campy distractions. 
While watching `Moulin Rouge', it reminded me of a couple of movies.  The first that I thought of was 1996's `Romeo + Juliet'.  I later found out found that he co-wrote and directed it as well.  The second I thought of was the Beatles' `Help' because of the playfulness and zaniness of some of the scenes.  So if you liked the style of `Romeo + Juliet', you may enjoy `Moulin Rouge'.     The music and songs were good and bad at times.  Luhrmann and Pearce take famous songs and blend them to create some interesting medleys.  Many artists are sampled, from Nirvana to Dolly Parton.  Madonna, the Beatles, and Elton John also have large chunks of songs thrown in.  The combinations are not always great but are original.  My favorite scene in the movie is when Christian (Ewan McGregor) is trying to convince Satine (Nicole Kidman) that they should be lovers.  Christian and Satine sing lyrics from famous love songs, while they are in on top of her elephant-shaped apartment (yes, she lives in an elephant).  They end up singing David Bowie's ""Heroes"" (great song).McGregor is outstanding, as the aptly named, Christian; the poet who falls in love with the most sought after prostitute at the Moulin Rouge.  His singing voice is good, and he handled his dramatic scenes very well. 
Kidman is Satine; the hooker that falls for the poet and suddenly develops morals (the hooker with the heart of gold).  I have never liked Kidman, and I have a hard time believing that Satine was the most popular prostitute.  I don't see it.  She does sing well, however.  If you are a fan, you should like this new dimension of her.The best performance in the film was by Jim Broadbent, as Harold Zidler, the owner and pimp' of the Moulin Rouge.  He was great.  He reminded me of the wizard in the ""Wizard of OZ"".  He was funny and he sang well. 
The bottom line is that I am glad I saw this movie, however the craziness and silliness was taken too far for my tastes.  I wish Luhrmann had made a more serious movie that was consistent with the love story.  I can, however, appreciate the creativity and work that went into this movie; it is quite an accomplishment.  I think if you are a fan of Broadway musicals, you should like it.  6 out of 10",Moulin Rouge!

There are some who say it is the biggest mistake in film history, and others who say that it is one of the most unique and wonderful films ever to grace the silver screen (and then there are those who don't know what to make of it.)Well, since everyone seems to have an opinion, I'll put in mine: I loved it. I found to be unique and fascinating.  Here are some things to expect:1. Kinetic energy!!  Hold on to your hats, the beginning moves VERY fast, so keep up.2. Great acting from Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and the colorful supporting cast.3. Music.  What a big way for the musical to come back!  The modern songs effortlessly flow through the film and enhance it.4. Color.  Look for crisp, clear, overwhelming color.5. Fun, humor, and the experience.  You don't watch Moulin Rouge, you experience.  So have fun!  Laugh out loud!  And lastly, SEE IT.",Moulin Rouge!

But as I talked about it,thought about it and listened to the sound track, I couldn't wait tosee it again. I liked it so much more the 2nd time. Visuallyimpressive, entertaining characters and above all, wonderful music.McGregor is remarkably impressive. I had no idea a jedi could sing soamazingly well. I can't wait to see it again.

642,aleix_wiggum_93,Moulin Rouge! A Sparkling Diamond,10,10 October 2007,"Moulin Rouge! it's a very entertaining musical film. With a great cast: including Ewan McGregor & Nicole Kidman, giving one of her best performances. One of the best things of the film is the set-decoration and costume design. Wonderful! The soundtrack is one of my favorites. It contains in the same song a part from a song of KISS (I was made for loving you) and Elton John (YOUR SONG)or in SPARKLING DIAMONDS, Marylin Monroe (DIAMONDS ARE GIRL'S BEST FRIEND) and Madonna's (MATERIAL GIRL). My favorites songs are: .Lady Marmalade: the most famous song of the film. It's a super-mega-hit performed by Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lil Kim, Mya and Missy Elliot. .Sparkling Diamonds: great medley of Diamonds are... and Material Girl. When Nicole sings it in the film it's fantastic. .Your song: a lot of sensitive. .Children of the revolution: great song performed by Bono and many more. .One day I'll fly away: Nicole sings it very well. .Diamond dogs: I love this song. The lyrics and the melody are impressive. .The Elephant love medley: The best medley of the film. And the performances are so good. .Come What May: I think that's the best song of the film. Ewan and Nicole do it perfect! .Complain de la Butte: French good song. .Hindi sad diamonds: Strange song but I like it. .Like a virgin: So good. .Meet me in the red room: special. The music is amazing. .Show must go on: VERY VERY GOOD! And the song is one of the best of Queen.The other songs are: Nature Boy, Because we can, Rhythm of the night, Tango de Roxanne, The Pitch and Bolero.The argument of the film is so typical. A history of love, about a man and a woman that they can't be lovers.A part from this, it's so wonderful and enchanting. Don't miss it! I Love Moulin Rouge.",Moulin Rouge!
643,tony-148,bizarre movie,3,22 December 2001,"Moulin Rouge could have been best movie musical since the heydays of MGM, with it's unparralled sets, incredible theatrical style lighting, and last but not least it's massive musical and dance numbers, but sadly it falls short because all these things come crashing down as it becomes a parody of itself over and over throughout the film.Including contemporary music, costuming and locations, yet reatining the classic story and dialog realy worked for Baz Luhrmann in his version of ""Romeo + Juliet"".  These things drove the story and made it more accessible to a younger audience.Moulin Rouge! didn't need this, the story stood on it's own and didn't need gimics to draw audiences in.  The ridiculous overuse of  contemporary music turned what could be a classic into Vaudville.  Once it's clever, twice it's tollerable, but relying on this ""joke"" throughout the entire movie ruins it's entertainment value.  One minute it's story and character development is drawing you in, the next minute a kareoke version of ""Roxanne"" is being belted out.",Moulin Rouge!
644,joyday,I felt stunned afterward!,5,2 June 2001,"It was very colorful with many exotic costumes and sets!My eyes were fairly popping out. In fact, I wish they had finished out the dances instead of cutting them off. We didn't get to see the precision can-can dancers line up kicking for more than 30 seconds at a time, which was disturbing to me; because I love dancing.The love story was satisfying. Kylie Minogue has a 2 minute Peter Pan-like flying and singing part which is excellent, but I wish they had given her a bigger part.The old pop songs blend very well. I especially loved ""Like a Virgin! which was a comedy."" There is singing about 80% of the time!!! The music was loud; your ears will be ringing.Saturday, 4 pm and the theater was completely full; nearly all were over 50. I'm pretty sure kids would be bored unless they were little Billy Elliot dancers. No one applauded, not during and not at the end. At the end you could hear a pin drop. 50% of the audience began to leave immediately, and the rest either stood in the aisles talking or sat watching the credits.The lasting impression was that too much was happening too quickly and too many scenes ended prematurely.",Moulin Rouge!
645,Kevinduran,Completely dreadful and overrated!,1,18 December 2001,"I went to see this movie with a certain amount of enthusiasm, having heard so many good things about it.  What I saw were sets that looked like they were made out of cardboard, covered with glitter and Christmas lights. Could someone please explain why John Leguizamo's nose changed sizes throughout this flick?  And why did he look like he was walking around on his knees?  Ewan McGregor's teeth look like he's been chewing on dirt, his hair looked like a wig, and he looks like he smells like he's a heavy smoker.  Nicole Kidman was alright, but her demise was as predictable as anything I've ever seen.  Never have I seen something that was so poorly written and executed.

But other moment of this film compensate greatly.  What a wonderful escape.  Telouse was annoying, but I loved the rest of the Characters, I wonder if the actors were working together, of if Baz Luhrmann told each of them a different style to go for.   The most visually delicious movie I have seen in forever.  It is like any old hollywood musical in that is completely presentational, but what fun. Better than anything else I've seen in years.   The fact that the movie is so polarizing speaks highly of director. People love it, or hate it.  That's because unlike most directors, Baz Lurhmann did not back down.  He gave us the story the way he wanted to. Without comprimise.  Not worried about trying to please everyone.

The ""tortured artist"", the ""courtesan with a good heart"", the ""evil rich guy""....even if the very first line of the movie didn't spoil the ending, it's as predictable as the sun rising in the morning. Now, to be fair, I do have to give credit to the amazing sets and the remarkable choreography of some of the musical numbers. I didn't particularly enjoy the music arrangements in the movie but if you did, fair enough. I'm not going to call you stupid for that, I just enjoy the originals better. But I just can't forgive the beat-for-beat, scene-by-scene predictability of this movie. It never goes anywhere other then where you expect to go. And what's the oh-so-inspirational, oh-so- original thought the movie builds to? ""Love is good"". Yeah, that's about it. ""You should try to have love in your life because being loved feels good"". Wow. That's right up there with ""Water is wet"".

653,polargirl,Bravo Baz!,10,3 August 2003,"Anyone who loves artistic, emotional and different films has to see this masterpiece by Baz Luhrman. As the third installment of the red curtain trilogy by Luhrman it clearly indicates how the director has developed as an artist.To begin with it has to be said: Moulin Rouge is not for everyone. Due to the fact that it has a unique and at times absurd take on the musical genre. However, I think its pure genius. The way in which cliché after cliché is uttered by the protagonists and modern songs are given a new treatment to suit the orphean myth in this musical, which set during the belle epoque, is just awe inspiring.This movie touched me on so many emotional levels due to the clever usage of known songs and overly romantic dialogue.The fact that Moulin Rouge can make an audience laugh and cry, and all the while be utterly entertained is very extraordinary in a time when Hollywood produces so many movies that you feel like you've already seen ten times before and that make you wonder why on earth you even bothered to pay for the ticket.The casting is superb.I wasn't a big fan of Nicole Kidman before this movie but this movie truly proves she has star power and great screen presence. Ewan Macgregor  is equally astonishing in his role.The chemistry between the two is sparkling and its amazing how they can make their love for each other so believable in such an unbelievable story.The art direction deservedly won an oscar, creating a suiting atmosphere for the movie: heightened reality at its best.This movie is  an art piece. It made me feel and experience something truly unique and memorable. The music, art, casting, directing, photography, editing and mood, make Moulin rouge a roller- coaster ride of emotions you do not want to miss!",Moulin Rouge!
654,MattD12027,The Saddest Movie Of All Time,10,20 November 2006,"Who knew that such a visually and aurally stunning movie would also be the saddest movie of all time? Bahz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet) explores and expands his colorful, manic, and at times overwhelming style in Moulin Rouge!, but he also has learned how to create a coherent narrative.Moulin Rouge! tells the story of Christian (McGregor), a young quasi-Bohemian in Paris near the turn of the century. He becomes fascinated with Moulin Rouge!, the club in which streetwalkers become celebrities and the rich and the poor mix in a kind of decadence that the club is now internationally famous for. The object of his affection is Satine (Kidman), the premier attraction of the club. She can only be bought for the highest of prices.Seems like a clichéd plot, doesn't it? Well, any one new to this film will be in for a surprise. The sets are absolutely ravishing, the production and sound design are unparalleled even to this day, and the pure pathos exhibited in this film hits right to core. McGregor and Kidman do their singing on the actual set...none of what is in the final film is prerecorded. It has been polished...but their original work is there. And it is stunning. Who knew the two of them had such huge voices? McGregor especially is an eye-opener here. We knew he could act, but to sing like that? Amazing.The lovers live in bliss for a short time, but like all good things that has to come to an end. Passion, lies, murder...again, more clichés, but it works here because we are so emotionally invested in these characters by the end of the film. The tragedy is so overwhelming at the end that many of the people I've watched this film with were literally sobbing by the conclusion. My eyes weren't dry either. There is something so elemental about how love is portrayed in this film--""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return."" And that is the greatest thing we have learned. Then that is shattered, stripped from us in the final moments. The end of this film is so cathartic that it leaves you breathless. Moulin Rouge! is easily the saddest film ever made.",Moulin Rouge!

I just got the double-DVD edition of this from you local library and I feel very fortunate to be able to devolve it as fast as possible.Other reviewers, thank God, have had the good taste of recognizing the intrinsic flaws of this flick (pun intended). It's out of any gender and type, out of context, to be true. Nothing is respected, neither the time this story is supposed to have happened, nor the music, nor anything. It's just a shrill, nincompoop attempt at assaulting our senses and our taste by a totally, fundamentally, inept director. One should really prohibit him from working, he's certainly better at selling hot dogs than making films! Well, it's ten years the flick was made. It seems to have gained a certain ""cult"" status, but very undeservedly so in my opinion. Taste is difficult, albeit impossible to discuss, the Latin proverb says is, but nevertheless I had to get rid of my bad feelings about this.",Moulin Rouge!
656,lstrawser,Cocaine and Skittles,4,12 December 2020,"Baz Luhrmann's kaleidoscopic 2001 musical wowed audiences with its audacious camera work, editing, lavish sets and costumes but nearly 20 years on it has aged like milk. Its pure style over substance and tragically the style Mr Lurhman has employed looks cheap and attention seeking, the meat of the film vapid and well trodden.Ewen McGregor plays a writer captivated by the Courtesan Satine (played by Nicole Kidman) who is contractually promised to a Duke who is funding the conversion of the night club Moulin Rouge into a theater. Moulin Rouge draws from several Operas, piecing together plot strands like Legos and it's musical numbers are similarly sourced from pop radio, often several songs are cut and spliced together, different familiar tunes sung in counterpoint by different characters. having borrowed from well known material it becomes quite predictable, leaning heavily on its style to hold audiences attention.In 2001 the novelty of the garish colors, ornate set designs, frenetic camera and snappy editing blew audiences minds in the context of a musical; a genre that had long fallen out of favor. Its style proves fleeting however, seeming to be the result of a raucous cocaine fueld bender that irritates. Performances are similarly heightened with Nicole Kidman's character moaning, writhing and eliciting lupine barks and howls. The absurd firey facial hair and bulging eyes of the Moulin Rouge's owner, Harold Zidler, match the rest of the film's unabashed gaudiness.There are some ocassions when all of this ostentatious style comes together and functions as a masterclass in editing and sound design, the ""Roxanne"" sequence in particular is a highlight, cross cutting between two musical numbers and the Duke and Satine in a profoundly affecting highlight. Unfortunately this isn't sustained, the film imbibes in another bump of fine white powder and promptly reverts back to being shiny garbage.Moulin Rouge may have seemed like a breath of fresh air when it premiered but its stylistic choices have condemned its appeal to a specific period of time. While older musicals like Jacques Demy's Umbrellas of Cherbourg remain timeless, Luhrmann's effort deserves to rot in a nursing home unremembered by future generations, unvisited by those with fond memories of its decadence and high camp.",Moulin Rouge!

Much like ,""Dancer in the Dark,"" I will definately be buying this when it comes out on DVD as I have to own this masterpiece!! The use of modern songs in the old setting of 1899 Paris oddly worked for me. I was thrown off at first when McGregor started singing, ""The hills are alive with the sound of Music,"" but then I got interested. By the time ""Like a Virgin,"" hit I was amazed, that song alone makes me want to go see the movie again. The last song in the movie is outright amazing!!

659,jefu,An Incandiferous Spectacular Spectacular!,10,17 November 2002,"First, my summary :""Moulin Rouge!"" is a brilliant surrealist assemblage/collage, grand music, beautiful cinematography.  Deserves to be considered one of the great movies ever.And now the nitty gritty bitties :The first time I saw this, I enjoyed it.The second time I didn't like it as much.  ""So so at best"" was my thought.Then one day while I was doing something else, I put it on as background and suddenly found myself paying attention.  (Probably worth noting at this point that I've only seen it on TV - it takes a rare film to drag me into a theatre - but this is one film I'd love to see in a theatre.)  Time to look it up in IMDB and read the comments and other information carefully. ""Wow, a lot of people really like this, and a lot of people really HATE it.""I made a point to watch it again the next evening, put the sound through the stereo, turn the volume up a bit, turn lights down.  Often enough when I do this, about five minutes into the film I get bored and go off to do something else.  Not with ""Moulin Rouge!"" - I was hooked.Since then I've seen it several times and every time I watch it, I find more to like - a bit more to dislike as well - but the stuff to like is by far the larger part.The plot is hackneyed, the pacing uneven, the editing at times intrusive.
On the other hand ...Think Max Ernst (""Une Semaine de Bonte'""), Salvadore Dali, even Picasso. Think  Lewis Carroll, Reymond Queneau, James Joyce. And most especially, remember opera.""Moulin Rouge!"" is a surrealist collage, a mix of dreamscape and reality. Its an impressionist cityscape built almost of pointilliste scale cinematic (and audio) Legos --  symbols, allusions, quotes,  archetypes, a dash of postmodern sensibility.  Its an operatic (spectacular!) spectacular with its own leitmotifs, and as (often enough) in  opera, its not the story that matters most.Luhrmann presides over the production with vision and discipline.  What sometimes looks like a mess on first viewing reveals itself (usually -- there are some exceptions) on closer consideration to be a very deliberately constructed stew -- filled with detail and allusion.  Musically, we often hear the shortsighted say ""None of the music is original"" -- but why should that be a bad thing?  By using music we know, Luhrmann gets to play off our associations of one piece against another, of music against performer, and of music against visual.  Think Zidler doing ""Like a Virgin"", or the Paris toffs with ""Teen Spirit"".You can almost imagine Luhrmann taking a favored collection of films (and cartoons), music and other bits of cultural detritus and cutting it all up and heaping it up, then taking out bits as he comes to them and putting them all together into a whole.  Luhrmann's vision combines a very carefully planned visual style, an equally carefully planned musical score, some wondrous choreography, an oddly wonderful sense of humour and, well, lots more.  He builds from these pieces a whole that is  brilliant, coherent, compelling, funny and wholly his own.And to top it off, its a whole pile of fun.Watch for the allusions - the moon from the Lumiere brothers is the most obvious from film, but there are many more.  I think you could do a final exam for a film course by showing a ten minute segment from this film (almost at random) and asking students to note down all the films referred to.And watch for the stuff that just flashes by.  I don't have a DVD player, but am tempted to get one almost this movie alone -- there are several things I'd like to look at very slowly to see if what I think is happening is really happening.A final note - ""The Roxanne Tango"".  Gosh.  Wow.  Speechless.",Moulin Rouge!

And for fun let's put an extraordinaliy fat red-faced bloke who can fly around and rap like a thug. Geez guys, sounds like a real winner to me. Not. Kurt Cobain is turning in his coffin.",Moulin Rouge!
661,ross-41,"Awsome Musical, not for all tastes",9,22 January 2002,"Alright, Stop right now and sit down.  This one isn't for everyone.  I brought this one home as a rental, and the little lady almost immediately settled into the `you'll owe me for this' mode.  I absolutely loved this one.  And from what I can see on the net, sounds like our reaction(s) were fairly typical.  This is a love it or hate it flick.Do me a favor.  Think back to `Romeo and Juliet' w/ Leonardo and Claire Daines.  Remember the drunken party at the Capulets?  Remember the scene w/ Juliet's mother before the party, full of accelerated frame rates and wacky music?  If those were your favorite scenes from that movie, you'll love this one.  Other wise, it probably won't work for you.  Come to think of it, the overall style structure of Romeo is almost copied to the beat for this one. Surprise, Surprise; they are both done by the same director; Baz Luhrmann.
The opening 10 minutes are the litmus test of the whole flick.  The grand sweep through the Paris set, up to Christian's apartment w' the Narcoleptic Argentinean and Dwarf Bohemian, then steam rolling into the Moulin Rouge w/ the loudest musical intro I can remember; this all sets the scene for event that follows.  But of course, I would commit a sin if I didn't mention the opening conductor over the 20th Century Logo.This is a movie that takes all the typical (predictable) conventions of movie mechanics and throws them out the window.  The editing can be frantic, often cutting to 3 or 4 different cameras in less that 2 seconds.  The acting is over the top, especially with the owner of the club.  And the music becomes an extra character.  It is shocking what songs they try (and mostly accomplish) to work into the dialogue of the musical.  `Material Girl' works into Santine's opening number, `Your Song' becomes the main love song, and even `Roxanne' gets reinvented into a drunken tango while being cut between three different sequences.Quickly about the movie mechanics.  The story is surprisingly simple, a love story of star-crossed lovers in an age where love should be simpler, but as always this story has been told before.  I did like the old play-in-a-play routine that went right over the head of the Duke until it was thrust in his face during the final rehearsal.  The acting is above average; witness the comedy of errors between Christian and Santine during their initial meeting.  The Visuals, style and presentation are top notch.Yet again I've found a `frameable' movie, where every frame is a work of art.  Every sequence and camera movement is a choreographed ballet. One of my favorite sequences in the whole movie takes place in the `Elephant' from the time the Duke walks in on Christian and Santine, to the improvised rehearsal and final group presentation.  The energy in this scene alone puts whole other movies to shame.Unconsciously, I've written most of this review so far without actually mentioning the names of Ewan or Nicole.  They just totally sold me on becoming the characters.  Nicole has finally crawled out from under the shadow of tom (small t) and established herself as a legitimate leading lady.  And John Leguizamo once again amazes me with his ability to play supporting roles.  He has enough personality to grab your attention, and enough sense to step aside and not showboat.Any negatives?  Just a few minor ones.  After the first half hour, there is a noticable downshift in the energy as the plot kicks in and things get more serious.  In the long run, that is probably the wise move, as the initial celebration can not realistically be maintained.  But it is missed.  There is also one point where the songs cross the line between excess style and offensiveness, and that is where we have a fat red-haired man with a mock nun's outfit singing `like a virgin'.  just a bit outside of where I needed to go.Oh, and by the way, anyone who wants to see this movie in anything other than widescreen is out of their freaking mind. The opening curtain alone would be destroyed.  And there are numerous shots where the cinematographer obviously decided to ignore the Pan n Scan idea and shoot dance numbers that took up the far left and far right at the same time. The DVD is gorgeous.  I wish I had seen this in the theater, with a full sound system and 80 ft screen.  IMAX anyone?Just treat it as a musical and this is hard to put down. 9/10",Moulin Rouge!
662,vizli,"Wonderful, Glorious Tragedy",10,25 March 2007,"When I first saw Moulin Rouge! at the movie theater, I was shocked, surprised and stunned by the most most original cinematology I had ever seen. Its difficult to explain the visual feast for the eyes created by Baz Luhrman in this masterpiece. Suffice to say, no one had ever seen anything like it before. But to dwell only on the visual aspect of this movie does a grave disservice because it is not only a visual marvel but also a superb film in its own right. I have never been a huge fan of traditional musicals such as ""Oklahoma"" or ""Sound of Music"". However, Moulin Rouge! completely explodes and re-invents musical film-making. With all deference to the subsequently released ""Chicago"", Moulin Rouge! is in a league of its own. The melange of pop songs in the ""Elephant Song"" could have easily have been a disaster but here, it fits perfectly with the story. I would also be remiss not to mention the performances of Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor. Kidman is a revelation. First, her singing was surprisingly accomplished. But the true stunner was the vulnerability and honesty that comes across in her performance - it was simply breathtaking. MacGregor also shocks with his convincing if unspectacular singing and well as his simple but spot on performance as the young and penniless writer. I see literally dozens if not hundreds of movies a year, both classics and new releases but I only own about ten DVDs and reserve purchases only to the absolute classics like The Godfather Trilogy and ""The Maltese Falcon"". Yes, one of the privileged few DVDs on my shelf is Moulin Rouge! Enough said!",Moulin Rouge!
663,essmeier,"Two trains full of confetti, colliding head on",2,18 June 2001,"What a mess!  Director Baz Luhrmann takes every known cinematic gimmick, tosses them all into a food processor, and splatters the mixture all over the screen like a would-be Jackson Pollock.  It's loud, brash, colorful, relentless, and doesn't make a lick of sense.  The result is a musical that seems to take place at no particular time, and in no (despite the name) particular place.  There's nothing here that even remotely evokes either Paris or credibility, and character development is nonexistent.  Ewan McGregor meets Nicole Kidman, mutters a few Bernie Taupin lyrics to her, and she immediately declares that she's ""in love.""  Uh, right.  The next 100 minutes consists of various characters engaging in routine and stereotypical melodrama, singing bits and pieces of twentieth century pop songs to one another with songs rarely being sung in their entirety.     The ""Like a Virgin"" sequence rivals the ""Officer Krupke"" sequence from ""West Side Story"" as perhaps the worst three minutes ever presented in a musical film.     The conclusion of the story is totally unmoving, since you don't know the main characters well enough to care about them.  When it's over, you just sit there wondering why you paid good money to be visually and aurally assaulted for 126 minutes.     On the plus side, Luhrmann's use of color is impressive.  Kidman looks absolutely radiant, and she and McGregor both sing surprisingly well.  The opening credits are quite clever.     I'd have been tempted to give this film a rating of zero, but the film is so emotionally uninvolving that I just didn't care about it or any of its characters enough to hate it that much.  2/10.",Moulin Rouge!

Yes, it is a musical, and yes, there is a reference to the Sound of Music, but this is unlike any musical every made before. I am not really a fan of some of the high speed frenetic film editing that you can find in today's music videos but somehow I was not bothered at all by the video acrobatics that make up most of Moulin Rouge, it really seemed to fit with the whole picture.But for all the flash, this movie is first and foremost a romance. And not a sappy sickly sweet love story but one that can really touch you... if you let it. It reminded me most of ""Shakespeare in Love""... but actually was much more effective in showing the love between them.It's also one of those movies that you want to see again... immediately!",Moulin Rouge!

Luckily, through word of mouth from friends who usually have reliable movie recommendations, I decided to give it a chance.     It isn't just a movie, it's an adventure. A wild trippy ride that takes you where no movie has ever taken you. I should have been more prepared, knowing the un-orthodox style of the director, Baz Luhrmann. However, even his previous ground-breaking style movies such as Romeo + Juliet & Strictly Ballroom gave no indication that a movie such as this was on the horizon. See it! Enjoy it!

Stunning to look at, occasionally touching, but overall an empty exercise in film.

670,Brodie_500,"Ambitious, engrossing spectacle.",10,29 October 2001,"Moulin Rouge is what it sets out to be: a dazzling, colourful, exuberant celebration of bohemia and song. Normally, such glossy, seemingly shallow fare would best be avoided, but Moulin Rouge is an exception. And a damn good one at that.*small spoilers*Ewan McGregor is Christian, a romantic young poet with a knack for improvising song lyrics, a talent that brings him (via some drunken bohemians) to the Moulin Rouge - a nightclub for the rich and the beautiful, a whirlwind of sex and glamour. After a case of (that old screwball chestnut) mistaken identity, Christian ends up inadvertently falling for (and winning over) the queen bee of the Moulin Rouge - Nicole Kidman's courtesan Satine. Their romance is cemented in a visually stunning (and well sung) performance of Elton John's 'Your Song', but (as with all romances) their love is threatened, in this case by a whining rodent of a Duke (Richard Roxburgh). He wants Satine and seeing as Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the owner of the Moulin Rouge, needs the Duke's financing, he agrees to hand his star attraction over.The narrative is as dull and unoriginal as that. As far as the story is concerned, Moulin Rouge is poor. But this, surprisingly, doesn't seem to matter much. The story is secondary, a mere backdrop for Luhrmann to stage extraordinary musical numbers, and to display a range of emotions in the most glamorous and dazzling ways possible. If his attempts at doing so had fallen flat (none do), then this film would have been disastrous, like a 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' without the wryness and the controversy.Luhrmann delivered us an overly familiar story for a reason: this film is so packed with music, song, extravagant camera angles and sheer personality that an original story could have been overload. What Luhrmann has given us instead is a fantastic, original idea. The anachronistic use of familiar music is a pure success. The sentiments of each song represent what the Moulin Rouge was; a place of freedom, energy and lust (this is best shown in the introduction to the nightclub, when Luhrmann splices 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'Lady Marmalade' and 'Diamond Dogs' with a manic reworking of the Can Can).The film's unrelenting energy may overwhelm some, and it NEVER lets up. This can be seen as a virtue, but if you're unprepared for it, it could work the other way.Whether you love Moulin Rouge for its anachronism and explosiveness, or if you hate it, it can't be denied that Moulin Rouge is made by people with talent and vision. Luhrmann puts on a grand show, and his actors serve him very well indeed.Roxburgh copes well with the cliched Duke, while Broadbent is completely charismatic as Zidler. In the leads, Kidman and McGregor are outstanding. Although her vocals shake on the odd occasion, Kidman demands to be watched - her startling rendition of 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' is magnificent, reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich, but she gleefully ditches the sophistication when she partakes wonderfully in the impromptu song-and-dance pitch for a play. McGregor is also enchanting as he perfectly captures the dreamy-eyed, romantic optimism of Christian. His voice is stunning, and he is an ideal hero. Broadbent, Kidman and McGregor all deserve Oscar noms for their work, and I wouldn't be surprised if Kidman takes one home.Other scenes to watch out for: the wonderfully executed tango to 'Roxanne', the show-stopping 'Like A Virgin' routine, a witty exchange of song lyrics between Kidman & McGregor atop a huge bejewelled elephant, and an hilarious cameo from Kylie Minogue as a green sprite with a fondness for 'The Sound of Music'.Moulin Rouge takes advantage of the magic of cinema, a concept that is so often talked about, but rarely used with such conviction, originality and ambition. Allow it it's flaws, and appreciate its many virtues - a great show.10/10",Moulin Rouge!
671,StarsGirl59,"A beautiful, lovely, amazing film about ""truth, beauty, freedom, but above all, love""!",10,4 August 2002,"I must admit, before I first saw this movie (my friend Jessica dragged me to the theatre) I was utterly skeptical (this was before the Oscar nods and raving reviews). How could a musical about a nightspot with a stale, old plot be any good? In more ways than I could have dreamed.
The acting is spectacular, as are the cast's voices. Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman sing and act beautifully; their chemistry jumps right off the screen! MacGregor has one of the loveliest voices I've ever heard. Listening to him belt out ""Your Song"" is amazing (not to mention the fact that his smile makes me melt). How did he not get an Oscar nomination?!? Jim Broadbent (as the exuberant Harold Zidler, the ""king"" of the Moulin Rouge) is fantastic in his supporting role, and Richard Roxburgh as the villianous Duke is perfect for the part. Baz Luhrmann is an utter genius. A genius! It has so many of his special little touches that make the film unique and original. I can think of few other directors who could pull this off with as much grace as he did. It was a cinematic crime that he was robbed of an Oscar nomination. (This movie recieved far less Oscar recognition than it deserved).
The story may have been used many times in the art of film, but Luhrmann and Craig Pearce (his co-writer) make it stunningly unique. It's heartbreaking yet beautiful. There are few other movies that touch the heart such as this.
The music is spectacular! Reinventing many songs such as ""Roxanne"", ""Your Song"", and ""Like a Virgin"" (though I must admit I found that sequence a bit unnecessary) was delightful to watch, and I especially loved the ""Elephant Love Medley"" where Christian sings a mixture of classic love songs including ""All You Need is Love"", ""Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong"", ""Just One Night"", and ""I Will Always Love You"" in attempt to convince Satine that they ""could be heroes forever and ever"". The few originals of the movie (such as Satine's hopeful melody ""One Day I'll Fly Away"" and the wonderful, beautifully lyrical ""Come What May"") are absolutely FANTASTIC!
All in all, this movie is stunning. This movie is colourful. This movie is beautiful. This movie is heartbreaking. This movie is hopeful. This movie is quietly happy. This movie is more than just a movie. It is a secret longing to be loved, and loved alone that we all have inside us, which whether we have it boldly out in the open, like Christian; or silently locked in away inside so that barely even we know, like Satine, is undoubtedly there. See this movie. You won't regret it. the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return....",Moulin Rouge!
672,StephaneD,"energy driven by easy love, if not rythm...Alas!",2,14 October 2001,"Love, Love, Love...it seems to be the only purpose of this musical... True, the action and settings are really great; everything is in excess of everything: it is nervous, vibrating, loud (sometimes too loud). It's cacophonic in the first half hour, so that you lose almost all contact with the story, but you later get back on your feet. But when you consider the plot, it's really predictable. If a simple story is not really a problem for the first half of the film, with so many other things occupying your mind, it becomes a big one when the action is slowing down in the second part. Here you discover the one-sided face of the characters, the simplicity of the script at a whole : the total weakness of the second role characters (never seen such an insignificant Toulouse-Lautrec in a Montmartrian movie...), and the relatively small variety in settings starts to really suck towards the end. The movie is promising at the beginning, but end in a very loose way due to a total lack of rythm, if not love!!! Amelie is far more fun and captivating, if you want to deal with the ""Paris-clichés"" romances...without the boring. I give 4/10.",Moulin Rouge!

About a year later, there was nothing new at Blockbuster, so I picked it up.WOW! Moulin Rouge turned out to be such a wonderful movie (probably the only musical I'll ever like, though). Everything about it was fantastic and impressing.It's interesting because instead of the actors telling you what they feel, they sing it (and you can actually like the songs)! Music and singing can express feelings that words cannot. The simplest phrase when sung can add a lot more meaning and emotion.The songs were entertaining, the costumes and scenery were amazing, and the story line really keeps your interest.

Many films have tried to be like Moulin Rouge but none can compare. Highlighted by beautiful cinematography and vivid acting, (Nicole Kidman was utterly breath-taking,) Moulin Rouge gave the audience a trip into a colorful world unexplored by any filmakers. The one tick I have is why the Academy was so stupid to leave Baz Luhrmann out of the race for best director. ALL of the film is a genuine product of his beautiful mind, (wink, wink!) It has been the talk of Hollywood lately that 'Rouge' is being considered for Broadway adaptation. I say go for it! It can't be a bigger flub than the skewing of Lurhmann for the Oscar. I am now a bona fide fan of his, and i would love to see him bring ""Rent"" to the silver screen.(if you havent heard about this, click on his name.) **** (4 out of 4) -Give my regards to Broadway, remember me to Harold Square!-",Moulin Rouge!
675,johnk73,Fantastic music video,7,26 November 2003,"Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet uses a pop exterior to bring Shakespeare's rich dialogue to moviegoers who never would have sought it out. Characters are successfully translated, so that the audience can identify with them. The colorful presentation makes it fun to watch. Shakespeare's story makes this film easily rewatchable, especially in the modern context.Luhrman's Moulin Rogue! has flashy presentation AND pop music. But the story feels thin and stretched. It must compete for time with the (amazingly arranged) music, eye candy, and comical scenes. The underlying story is romance vs. pragmatism, and the challenge of whether or not love can conquer all did have me thinking about the ending two days later (a sign of a good story).I was blown away by the rooftop love-song duet. Having rented it the first time, I bought the DVD several months later. And found the film as a whole not very rewatchable. The music is still quite good though; I wish that there were an easier way to just play the songs, other than skipping through the chapters.The leads both did a good job getting us to identify with their characters, with the few serious scenes they had together. For instance, Nicole does a good job on the rooftop scene with eye contact, to show internal conflict, to help us believe she could still fall in love. They were obviously convincing, or the ending wouldn't have moved me so much.Expect a music video movie (as in Graffiti Bridge), and you won't be disappointed.

679,trypanophobic34,Visually luscious and irresistibly charming...,6,30 August 2005,"Moulin Rouge is one of those movies that depend on style over substance. It is very simply a love story that has been told many times over, and throws no fresh light on said love story and provides no original insight. It has not much to do with the actual club Moulin Rouge, which serves simply as a setting for the love story the movie centers on, with a few characters drawn from history (such as the ""dwarf"" Toulouse-Lautrec) and thrown in for comical effect.That being said, the sets and costumes and saturated colors in the movie are very appealing to the eye and, combined with the rather touching romance between Satine and Christian (interesting choice of names, by the way...) and quirkiness of the characters and dance numbers, are enough to hold your attention, especially once the movie gains momentum (it comes off rather strange and random at first and takes some settling into). Nicole Kidman is, of course, dazzling in the role of the sultry Satine, and her voice is quite good. Ewan McGregor's, while not as melodic as Kidman's, is good enough to serve the movie's purposes, and I'm sure a great many women have swooned/will swoon over his character. It is impossible not to be warmed at least a little by the two's secret love, although I was not quite sure why they fell in love in the first place...The dance numbers that are drawn from an amalgamated variety of modern songs are rather tacky but manage to work (some of them are barely pulled off, in my mind, and some are quite good). ""Roxanne"" is definitely my favorite in the movie (as many people will agree), probably because it's in the more conventional and serious style of musical numbers.",Moulin Rouge!
680,reverb_88,Very good.,8,12 January 2005,"OK, first of all it needs to be said that ""Moulin Rouge"" is a very strange movie and that there's a good chance it will confuse a lot of people. It's not like any other musical I've ever seen. On the scale of all things strange, it's like ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" times three. Intrigued? Yeah? Well so was I. So, I did some research and discovered that Baz Luhrmann's movie is actually a combination of three completely different musicals: ""La Bohème"", ""La Traviata"" and ""Orpheus in the Underworld"" smashed together and then mixed with a truly bizarre combination of modern musical stylings and twisted pop-culture. The results are anywhere from hilarious (Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"") to very touching (Elton John's ""Your Song""). At first, I wanted to start my review of ""Moulin Rouge"" by saying how I didn't understand how Luhrmann and Co. came up with the idea to make this film, but now that I think about it, it's really pretty obvious. It's very natural for filmmakers to want to make an ""updated"" version of an old play or an old film. They're doing it every single day. Now, making a new version work? That's the hard part. ""Moulin Rouge"" works because instead of shaping itself for its audience, it asks its viewers to shape themselves for the movie, thus pulling them into a strange and colorful world where anything can happen. It's loud and it's incredibly ambitious, but director/writer Baz Luhrmann juggles all of the movies themes very carefully. Every character is well established and well written.The film's tagline: ""No Laws. No Limits. One Rule. Never Fall In Love"" is pitch-perfect because it describes perfectly the conflict of the film. That is: what are the consequences of falling in love with a person who sells their body? Now, that's really under-analyzing the film. It's about a lot more than that: Death, sex, love, etc., but maybe that's a good place to start if you want to understand the plight of the characters in the film. The best sequence in the entire movie, a dance number featuring a Rouge prostitute and an employee that shifts focus into a sexual confrontation between the evil ""Duke"" character and Nicole Kidman's ""Satine"", really explores these central themes.""Moulin Rouge"" is the kind of movie that will divide people. But, I believe that most of the complaints that I've heard from the other camp about the film are simply ill-founded. The most common complaint that I've heard is that the movie is too ""bombastic"" in its imagery and that Luhrmann places too much emphasis on ""style"" over ""substance"". First of all, the expression ""style over substance"" is probably the most trite and cliché expression in the history of film, so it should not be used. (That's for you, guy on the IMDb forum). However, the basis for that argument is not very good either. ""Moulin Rouge"" does not feature its tremendously elaborate dance numbers simply to show off the talent of the director (though he definitely could do that). Naysayers argue that Luhrmann's movie is drowning in its own excess, but what they don't see is that THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. He wants us to see the trashy and elaborate life of the people that live and work in the Moulin Rouge club and after all, this IS a musical right? My vote: 8 / 10",Moulin Rouge!
681,bradjanet,The worst movie-going experience of my life.,10,12 December 2007,"Excellence in crassness, in vapidity, in editing that destroys what were apparently quite good dance sequences ...

Migraine inducing visuals, absurd musical choices, actors chewing the scenery while singing hammed-up versions of ""The Sound of Music"".Now, to be fair, I've never seen the film in its entirety, but I have tried to see it through three times to understand why some people love it ... and failed ... I can't make it to the end. The noisy, garish, tasteless assault defeats me every time. The only successful performance in the film is by Nicole Kidman's porcelain epidermis. Dancers of the calibre of Caroline O'Connor must have been furious at the way their performances were hatcheted.There was a movie in there somewhere Baz, but you couldn't find it, so you drowned it in treacle. Lovers of this film are masochists or boneheads.",Moulin Rouge!
682,KirkS,Still trying to mull it over,7,6 June 2001,"I must admit, I'm a sucker for musicals so my opinion is distinctly biased. If you get p***ed off when characters in a movie break into song, you probably won't like my review.Music:  Of course, the music is anachronistic which becomes a bit of an inside joke.  Christian (played by Ewan McGregor) is hailed as a brilliant original modern poet while spouting lines from popular music written two generations after 1900.  Of course we recognize them as top ten hits.  The Bohemians at the end of their summer of love (1899) find them strikingly new and original.  Most of the musical production numbers are medleys of songs appropriated from popular culture.  Madonna, Cole Porter, The Beatles, Nirvana and Sting get pulled out of context and used in weird ways.  This is not new.  Bing Crosby and Fred Astare managed to recycle more than 20 Irving Berlin songs in Blue Skies.  In most of the cases the songs get put through the wringer and come out as completely new compositions.  In some places the two songs are mixed into contrasting harmonies and lyrics that actually work well.  In other places you end up with a jumbled mish-mash of songs that don't really fit well together and spoil the effect.  In other cases the transformations demonstrate a twisted sense of black humor.  (Jim Broadbent's and Gary Oldman's dramatic duet of ""Like a Virgin"" complete with chorus line is worth about half the price of admission.)Plot:  Perhaps I'm a bit spoiled but the plot and the scripting seemed to be one of the weaker parts of this movie.  Not only was the music appropriated, but the script in places was appropriated as well.  The script alternates between slapstick and tragedy.  If you've been raised on too much opera, the movie keeps you guessing, is it heading towards Tosca or La Boheme?  The climax comes right out of Charlie Chaplin and then dumps you right into Verdi with a sweet Hallmark tag at the end.   I suspect this is a movie that most people either love or hate.  I'm a bit in the middle.  As a musical, this certainly isn't Sound of Music and it isn't even Evita.  The closest musical I can compare it to is Bob Fosse's almost-biography All That Jazz which is another movie that viewers either love or hate.  I suspect that All That Jazz would be a good barometer for determining if you want to see Moulin Rouge.  If you thought All That Jazz was worth watching, then you would probably appreciate Moulin Rouge.  If you find that self-referential and critical musicals are overly self-indulgent, then you probably should skip Moulin Rouge.",Moulin Rouge!
683,KALKevin,Post-modern musical dazzles the senses,10,1 February 2002,"In 1915, after a private White House screening of D.W. Griffith's silent Civil War epic Birth of a Nation, President Woodrow Wilson hailed the movie, saying, `It's like writing history with lightning.'  If any movie deserves to carry the moniker `written with lightning,' it is Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, a flamboyantly delirious post-modern spin on the creaky old `Let's-put-on-a-show' musical.From its opening frames, in which an orchestra conductor wildly conducts the 20th Century Fox fanfare, it is clear that Luhrmann is not going to play to expectations.  Strains of `The Sound of Music' and `Nature Boy' lead us into Montmartre, the Bohemian corner of Paris, where a young writer named Christian (Ewan McGregor) is penning his latest tome, an ode to the only love he has ever known.The opening is somber and restrained, despite some truly eye-popping visual effects that take us into Christian's world.  We are relaxed, but only for a moment.  The second Christian's story propels into flashback, the audience is thrust into a world of sights and sounds that boggle (and almost assault) the mind.  We are introduced to a bevy of bizarre characters, including John Leguizamo as a lisping Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jacek Koman as a narcoleptic Argentinian (don't ask) and Matthew Whittet as famed French composer Erik Satie.It seems this group of Bohemians are looking for a new poet to provide lyrics for their latest musical offering, Spectacular Spectacular.  One sip of absinthe, and Christian has suddenly joined their band of merry men.  Of course, it helps that he is able to compose such poetic ditties as, `The hills are alive with the sound of music,' on a moment's notice.It is here that we realize Luhrmann is going to populate his movie not only with a bizarre cast of characters, but they are going to be singing songs that we all know and love.  It's a risky move, but Luhrmann makes it work as an integral convention for his story.  Christian is a great and gifted poet. What better way to demonstrate this than by having him write truly memorable poems?As Christian soon learns, the Bohemians still need the backing of Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent, in a role that truly shows his range), owner of the title nightclub.  And the star of the show is to be none other than Zidler's `sparkling diamond,' Satine (Nicole Kidman).  Zidler, however, has other plans, which include using Satine to secure the financial backing of an evil duke (Richard Roxburgh) to turn his Moulin Rouge from a nightclub into a legitimate theater and courtesan Satine into a legitimate actress.  Things get complicated (well, as complicated as this type of music could possibly get) when, through a case of mistaken identity, Satine and Christian wind up together and in love.That's the setup, and if it sounds like it borrows from countless other stories, well, it does.  But Luhrmann knows this.  He's not interested in telling a story that's never been told before.  He wants to tell a story in a way that's never been done before.To this end, Luhrmann succeeds.  After an opening act that literally never lets up (think the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, only with song and dance), he settles into his story with a comfortable pace.  We know pretty much everything that's going to happen for the next two hours, but thanks to Luhrmann's sometimes wacky sense of humor and truly phenomenal performances by his actors, it just doesn't matter.Of course, Moulin Rouge! is a musical, so the quality of its musical numbers certainly play a large role in the movie's success.  And to that end, the big question for those who haven't seen the movie yet is, `Can Nicole and Ewan really sing?'  Well, the answer is yes and no.  McGregor's voice is the better of the two, strong and confident like a chorus line singer determined to get the agents to sit up an notice.  Occasionally, he tries a little too hard (in one of the movie's final songs, he actually spits in Kidman's face), but that's all in keeping with the grand operatic passion that Luhrmann is trying to capture.Kidman can carry a tune, although she scoops up to some of her notes, and she sometimes seems a little unsure of herself.  But her acting more than makes up for it.  Her ability to range from light (very light) comedy to chest-thumping tragedy is truly remarkable.  In her opening number (`Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend'), she displays a kittenish quality for which none of her previous performances has prepared us.  And on top of that, thanks to Donald McAlpine's lush photography, she has simply never been more beautiful.  If audiences didn't know better, they could easily mistake her for a movie goddess from the Golden Age.Broadbent shines in every scene he's in, almost stealing the entire movie away from its leads with his hilarious take on Madonna's `Like a Virgin.' Roxburgh is a fitting, if two-dimensional villain, while Leguizamo is reduced to only a few minor bits, none of which demonstrate the actor's incredible talents or the character's depth.But minor quibbles aside, Moulin Rouge! is not so much a movie as it is an experience.  As Luhrmann has explained in interviews, the Moulin Rouge itself was the ultimate nightclub.  The rush that people got from going to Zidler's electrified extravaganza in the 1890s is the same feeling modern audiences get from going to a great club with an awesome DJ.  So, to give today's audiences that same feeling, Luhrmann has hired today's hottest remixers (including FatBoy Slim and Missy Elliott) to help fashion his musical statement.  And he has cut his movie into quick edits, never once letting his camera sit still.Some have complained about Moulin Rouge!'s use of previously written songs, but again, this is a cultural statement that Luhrmann is making.  Today's musical culture is rapidly becoming more and more dependent on sampling.  So Moulin Rouge! is the first `sampled' movie, which could place it on the brink of a new post-modern movement in film.  Only time will tell.",Moulin Rouge!
684,AllThumbs-1,YEAH!,9,1 August 2001,"Finally, a movie where I walked out feeling like I'd been entertained.  It seems like most movies this year have left me feeling offended and ripped off.  Moulin Rouge is a beautiful flick!  The plot was well written, actors did an excellent job, and I'm sure the costumes will be up for an award.This is a big 'ole love story.  I highly recommend bringing someone to snuggle.",Moulin Rouge!
685,mrhonorama,Audacious fun,7,10 June 2001,"To accuse Baz Luhrman of style-over-substance is missing the point, since the style is the substance of this giddy, splashy musical.  It is appropriate that Luhrman incorporates Queen's ""The Show Must Go On"" into this film, as this is the cinematic equivalent of a Queen song -- intelligent, over-the-top and winking in a knowing way that let's the audience know it's not just in on the joke, but part of it.The plot is just an excuse to throw together musical numbers and set pieces. To that extent, the second half of the movie drags and could have used some editing -- although the climactic scenes are very effective.  I'd ditch the ""Roxanne"" number, simply on the grounds that it was musically uninteresting, for starters.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both show the breadth of their talent, including their fine singing voices.  Jim Broadbent uncharacteristically chews the scenery, delightfully, while John Leguizamo characteristically chews the scenery, also delightfully.The use of music is almost always spot on, and any movie that not only touches upon Queen, but Elton John (big time), Sweet, Kiss and T-Rex shows an auteur who knows both zeit and geist in equal amounts. Oh, and the look of the film is just awesome, stitching together the best bits of cinema from the silents to Welles to today's cutting edge technology.And best of all -- it's the best Kylie Minogue/Placido Domingo film ever...7.5 of 10, only because of the draggy bits -- but still worth seeing.Mike Bennett",Moulin Rouge!
686,ymklein,deeply disappointing,1,3 June 2001,"Considering the hype, I was not surprised at how poor this flick was, but it did get respectable reviews, so off I went.  The opening sequence did not bode well; altogether too high energy to build on, it left the eye with nowhere to rest and, oddly, nothing to look at.  It all went downhill from there.  There is a limited amount of pleasure one can get from soft pop rock put to anachronistic purposes; less from camera work that never ceases its frenetic, but ultimately repetitive action. On the second reprise of The Show Must Go On, I became afraid that it would and left.",Moulin Rouge!
687,M-46,The best movie of the year!!,10,21 October 2001,"Before I saw the movie I read about it in a magazine. The writer said it was the best movie of the year and that all the Oscars where already been taken for this movie. It will not receive all the Oscars, but at least the most important ones like best actor and actress, best movie, best music, best script etc. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I'm sure I will see it a few times more in the cinema. It is a fairy tail situated in Paris around 1900, it tells it feels like it tells the story of Freddy Mercury in a different body (Nicole Kidman)and in a different place and time. But in the end it only tells a story about LOVE (how stereotype this sound, that's what it really is about). This is the second movie I will reward with a 10. The first was The Matrix.

688,bacoby13,A Fantastic Whiz-Bang Film,10,10 June 2001,"It takes a certain kind of movie to wow me, and glue to my seat. ""Moulin Rouge"" did that very thing. I'm a huge fan of Baz Luhrman's ""Romeo + Juliet"" and especially "" Strictly Ballroom"". His kinetic style and flashy direction give him a trademark that it seems no one in Hollywood would want to emulate. Injecting pop music into a genuinely 30s musical, just helped the movie roll along. You couldn't help but snicker when you hear incredible versions of ""Like  A Virgin"" and even ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" sung by old men. This movie moves at a pace that would make grandmothers faint, but would have 12 year olds drawn to the MTV style movements. Finally a movie that gloriously recreates something most see everyday, music videos, adding a story and placing in into a interesting environment. Thats basically what ""Moulin Rouge"" is: a music video.Its these kinds of movies that make me more and more excited about the kinds of films people are willing to make these days. If there were just 3 more Baz Luhrman's in Hollywood, we wouldn't have movies like ""Pearl Harbor"" or ""Battlefield Earth"", to name a few. The whole time I kept thinking how great this movie would translate to the stage. Wow. As of now, ""Moulin Rouge"" is the best movie I've seen this year.",Moulin Rouge!
689,wordcraft,"Yes, but...",2,3 July 2002,"...go back to the source. Yes, this was an enjoyable, hallucinogenic, MTV-video-and-sampling-era piece, but much of the hyperbole written by admirers here is probably from the keyboards of those so young they were never fortunate enough to have seen Pennies From Heaven. No, not that dire 90-minute Hollywood version (what WAS Potter thinking of, anyway?), but the original 1978 TV miniseries featuring Bob Hoskins and Cheryl Campbell. Sure, Baz Luhrmann lays it all on with a trowel, with Meliés moons and even a touch of Murnau tossed in there, but he succeeded more in hurting my eyes than actually blowing my neurons.Dennis Potter's Pennies from Heaven, swiftly followed by a dose of the even more potent magic of The Singing Detective (1986), would make this film seem very shallow. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing much but a grasp of fast-food moviemaking and cutting for the attention-challenged. But then again, Pennies From Heaven has 48 votes, and Moulin Rouge had over 20,000 at the last count, so what does that tell you? Beg, steal, or borrow a copy of the original Pennies From Heaven and then see if what glitters now in Moulin Rouge really IS gold.
P.S. Ewan McGregor made his small-screen début in another Potter production, the slightly iffy but still infinitely superior Lipstick on Your Collar (1993). I wonder how HE compares the two works?",Moulin Rouge!
690,pkanzow,Spectacular! Must see!,9,8 November 2001,"Okay, this movie has a trivial plot and no realism but that's not the point because it is a SHOW. It is not even about a show, it IS one.The beginning already shows this - the canvas becomes a curtain, with a conductor in front - you're not watching a stroy about the Moulin Rouge, you're sitting in the Moulin Rouge.The movie is not even trying to move you to the fin the siecle, to the early 1900's, to show you an historic show. NO, it's a show of TODAY, with TODAY's songs (songs of the 60's to 90's which did not exist in 1900 when the movie ""takes place"").So stop thinking. Just relax, and enjoy this extraordinary audiovisual experience. This is one of the movies that trade in realism for being an artwork, and that I like very much. The flying views of the city reminded me of ""The Crow"" and other comic strip movies, like ""Batman"" and ""Dick Tracy"". I love this kind of somewhat strange athomsphere.And I loved hearing well known songs in surprising arrangements, like ""Roxanne"", ""The Show Must Go On"", even ""I Was Made For Loving You"" sung by this elf, Nicole Kidman, instead of these ""horror-masked"" bad boys of KISS.I totally fell in love with this unique artwork, and gave it a 9/10. The missing 10th is due to I think it could have been done better, if you got the best singers/actors of the world which Kidman and McGregor are not. But without doubt they did a good job and I was surprised how well ""Obi-wan Kenobi"" can sing.

This movie was not only romantic, beautiful, sad, and fun, but one of a kind. The acting was excellent, particularly by Richard Roxburgh and Nicole Kidman (also both Aussies). In closing I have to say that I love this movie and I hope it is nominated for best picture at this years Oscars. This critically acclaimed  masterpiece is a must see for anyone.

It is also a shocking film, but not in the sense the word is generally used.  There is very little in the way of explicit sex or violence, and the humor, while a far cry from the standard Hollywood fare, does not attempt to push the envelope of bad taste. Moulin Rouge! is shocking in that every aspect of its design, from the over-the-top acting, to the frenetic editing, to the lavish sets and the unconventional manner of telling the the story, is a spectacular departure from conventional filmaking.  This is why so many people dislike it, but also why, for those who do enjoy it, repeated viewings are so rewarding.  The more comfortable one becomes with the film, the better it seems.  For my part, I was not sure what to think of Moulin Rouge! the first time I saw it, but I liked it enough to see it again, and I have seen it several times since.  It is true that it is not for everyone, but I would encourage just about anyone to see it at least once.  To use the words of the movie's male lead, played by Ewan McGregor, Moulin Rouge!

I believed that the movie would be the same pathetic thing; whores trying to carry a favorable tune but end up coming out with a ""pop"" song.I made a mistake.  I waited until video even after reading rave reviews and seeing it on the TOP 250 list.  I originaly went to rent Scary Movie 2 just so I could come on here and give it a bad review.  But while entering blockbuster a big Moulin Rouge sign stole my eyes and I decided to rent it instead. The movie began kind of dull, the first 10 minutes weren't good.  I have to say that because I want to tell you the truth.  But gradually the movie began to progress and I began to love every minute of it.  The music was brilliant!  Ewan McGregger and Nicole Kidman are wonderful!  There voices are mature and blend wonderfully together.  The music was irresistible. It's catchy AND likeable.  My favorite would have to be thier version of 'Roxanne.' But not only was the plot, acting, and music perfect but the setting was amazing!  It was surreal an romantic.  I loved everything about it and that includes the singing moon. In all this movie was one of the best romances of all time.  I believe it's right up thier with Gone with the Wind and Titanic.  And definetly one of the best musicals of all time, most certainly the best in the last two decades. In fact I loved it so much I went out and bought the CD and the DVD!

His work with Craig Pearce with the stories and dialogues has been great, and let's just hope for the best that they can give us in the future.For the present, enjoy the past of Paris, with a love story so tragic as delicate, a love story at the Moulin Rouge.And congratulations for the eternal and probably the best sentence of the last 3 years at movies:""the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return"";) RIC",Moulin Rouge!

""I didn't care about the characters"" or ""Its too wild and it's just nonsense"" or ""the songs were not original and the Pop songs they used were horrible.""  All these reasons might be true if you were watching the movie with your eyes closed.  This movie is viabrant and spectacular and the music had such an impact on me.  For people who don't care about the characters I can only say that you have no heart because this movie had so much emotion. If you think its nonsense then you probably don't like musicals.  ""I hate the way people just sing out of no where,"" says my friend during a conversation about the movie.  Maybe so, but that's what musicals are all about.  The Director of Moulin Rouge said that musicals during the time of the 40's would use music from the 40's to describe what was happening at an earlier time.  This is the same way Moulin Rouge works by giving us songs from many 1970's 80's and 90's generations.  This movie is not nonsense with a beautifully written script, score, and talented singing actors who worked hard on this dazzling spectacle.  This movie completely took my breath away.

699,supersoaker900,Good Lord! Spectacular!! (Some Spoilers),10,17 March 2002,"*SPOILERS*First of all, let me just say that Moulin Rouge has got to be one of the most original movies of 2001. I only recently brought the video in March 2002, but all the same I love it. As with most, I saw the trailer when it came out on cinema and shrugged it off as some Hollywood fad and ignored it. That was before I found out who directed it. BAZ LUHRMANN!!!!This man is truly a God amongst Directors. The cinematography and direction (Not to mention dialogue and humour) for this film gets top marks from me because Baz is my favourite director - I LOVED Romeo and Juliet.McGregor knocked me six ways from Sunday when he opened his mouth and belted out the romantic power ballad 'Your Song'. Everything just seemed to silence at that moment. (Baz knew this because the lights of Paris all lit up too) I couldn't find a fault with his voice at all, nor his acting. It was so much better and natural than his wooden performance in Episode I.Kidman did a nice job, though her voice took a little warming to. It's quite thin and high, but worked surprisingly well with Ewan's voice. She certainly did a good rendition of 'One Day I'll Fly Away' though I was more impressed with her 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' and 'Come What May'. I was particularly impressed with Kidman's acting skills. I've never really watched any of her films, and was pleased to see she could switch from a raving loony prostitute to doing a good job and coughing and wheezing  it sounded so real!Though the plot is straightforward and simple, Baz managed to make it something new and interesting in the best way he knows how; through pure and utter LUNACY. This was great. Baz certainly picked a clever way of introducing the co-stars  A narcoleptic (of all things) Argentinean falling through his roof and a Dwarf with a unusually long name (dressed as a nun) running into his room, then all of a sudden he winds up helping them on a play. Genius.A simple, zany and tragic love story (slightly reminiscent of both Romeo and Juliet and Titanic) Baz has redefined the genre of musicals. The singing was up to par, the dancing was moving (no pun intended) and the songs chosen were as if they were secretly written for the film twenty or so years ago. Fantastic. 10/10.",Moulin Rouge!

Admittedly, I liked the use of modern songs in a movie set well before the songs were actually written, but the whole thing was just too boring.

This is one of Ewan McGregor's worst movies, and only Jim Broadbent shows any ability to act at all.

Too much going on makes it hard to like what's happening because you don't know what the hell is going on sometimes and for some reason every one shouts. But hey that's Luhrman's style I guess. It kinda turns me off though. I didn't like Gatsby, I didn't like Romeo and Juliet, and I barely liked this film. I've seen it once so I'm not sure if I'll need or want to see it again.",Moulin Rouge!
706,charlietruffles,Mr. Luhrmann is great when he's not artistic,3,7 October 2003,"Everyone claims this film is a musical, but it's more like a documentary. The song and dance routines seem to be a dress rehearsal where the leads were off sick.  On Broadway, a show can get away with thin characterization and story through live interaction, distance from the stage, and lack of background elements.  But in a film these glaring errors come back to haunt the film.  Of course the irony is that the movie was staged and shot theatrically, without talented performers.  Actors that are skilled and successful in mainstream film were woefully miscast.  You can't hide the fact through slick cutting, electronically enhanced voices, odd angles (we were almost on the Titantic), and pop tunes that are a one trick dark pink pony.Many people enjoyed the film and it was even nominated for Best Film, but I firmly believe that it was because of how unusual it was and ""what"" the film had to say, but unusual doesn't mean good and thorough analysis would bring that to light.  My goal is not to tear down films that had ingenuity but a hope that the common filmgoer won't get ripped off going to the cinema.In a musical, the audience has a right to see song and dance and not actors parading around as performers.  The only exception is Frank Sinatra because he worked hard to refine his persona (and possibly Elvis Presley in Viva Las Vegas). Fred Astaire knew this and prevented directors from being creative by putting in his contract that he can only be shot in long shot.  He gave the audience a value-added performance-not some actor singing in the shower. Granted some of Astaire's scene were too long, but his performance never ceases to impress.  Why do you think slapstick is dead? No one wants to do stunts and pratfalls like in the early days.  I know it's a ""postmodern"" world but we're still the same homo sapiens who are suckers for a good 'ole song and dance routine with funny (or classy) outfits.To be fair, the art design and visual compositions (when they were long enough to notice) were carefully laid out.  I appreciate the production allowing Cinefex to cover them.  Nicole Kidman is stunning and alluring (whatever that truly means).  But don't kid yourself this is just a modern update of Cabaret which is a classic, set in a real era that deals with weighty issues.A message to anyone attempting to be Bob Fosse: Don't.  You'll trip and fall and break your leg.  But all I can say is smoke a few pack of cigarettes, dress in black, and watch his films.  If you aim high enough, you're bound to hit a mullet rouge.",Moulin Rouge!
707,syedniloferanjumali,he music is decent and the costumes and set design are fantastic. Plus McGregor and Kidman are awesome.,10,26 May 2012,"When I saw this one a year or two ago, I couldn't imagine how I existed without knowing about this musical masterpiece. It's a spectacular film, a beautiful love story told by a poverty-stricken English poet, and tons of songs by distinguishing singers and bands of 20th century (from Marilyn Monroe and the Beatles to Elton John and Madonna). The songs performed by the cast are music to the ears, and choreography is magnificent. There's only one amazing original song ('Come What May') in the film. Probably, the only thing that I didn't like about this movie is over-drama. Indeed, too much drama, too many tears shed by Christian, by Satine, even by Toulouse. Anyways, it's one of my top favorites and is therefore highly recommended.",Moulin Rouge!
708,gr8one232,Quite possibly the silliest movie I have ever seen,1,28 June 2004,"I must admit I did not watch the end of this movie, i had to shut it off after just over an hour. I didn't see the need to continue after that. I don't know what kind of ""vision"" the director had on this one, but I sure as hell didn't see it. This movie bored me to tears, and it seemed very childish at times. The music was terrible. Who thought it was a good idea to have Ewan McGregor start singing Smells Like Teen Spirit in the middle of a hearty romantic conversation? This movie was somebody's attempt at art, and I guess i just didn't get it. The scenery was impressive, but hey, I don't go to movies to stare at colors. I enjoy thick plots and great acting, which this movie does a good job avoiding with its campy story and way over the top characters. To this day I rank this movie as the worst big budget film I've ever seen. Two thumbs way down",Moulin Rouge!

710,hothelen,Set and costume design is beautiful and original,9,14 December 2016,Just amazing! I loved the adaptation of classic pop music and the sets were fabulous. I couldn't get enough of this film. The Australian actors were terrific and Baz is such a wonderful director it was breath taking in so many ways. Do yourself a favour and buy this movie on DVD and also buy the CD for some toe taping fun.The best song is a new version of Roxanne by the Police. Kidman is wonderful and does a great job with the songs - her look and costums are beautiful. Sad ending my wife would not stop crying! A real Aussie classic but is not the usual - a classy classic you and the family will love.,Moulin Rouge!
711,Basil-3,No one cares about your dogma!,1,17 January 2002,"A movie musical starring an unsexy sex symbol with an actor pretending to be a writer making up songs off the top of his head that are actually hacked from other musicals or pop songs, most of which were achingly bad in their original form.  My wife wanted me to see this with her, and I just kept staring at her.  Eventually, she was embarrassed by the bad call she made in picking this movie and wanted to leave, but I insisted that we stay to the end, and delighted in sharing the remaining 45 minutes of cinematic punishment.  This movie is a textbook example of two phenomena.  The first phenomenon occurs when the developers of a movie and its consumers convince themselves that a corporate-approved, non-threatening movie with talented actors and a big budget and flashy movement and costumes and the trappings of decadence must be a great movie since all the easily recognizable components of a great movie are covered in the ""checklist of elements of great movies."" 
This phenomenon actually works to some extent because the self-deception creates and moves the product.  In the U.S., demand for Titanic was so high that copies went on sale in stores that had never sold a videotape before. At one point, everyone was telling me to see Titanic.  Then everyone was telling me to buy Titanic.  Then everyone told me not to bother.  Now they sell on Ebay for US$1.00.  By the time that most of you read this review, this process will have already occured to Moulin Rouge.The other phenomenon is when the creators of a film convince themselves that movies about superficial themes, like a Paris dance hall/whorehouse musical, can or should be superficial films, because there's the available defense of ""of course it's a superficial film!  This movie is ABOUT surface!  Truth! Beauty! Freedom! Love!""What truth?  The romantic element of the plot rung false.  What beauty? Nicole Kidman is recurringly described in the American Press as ""alluring,"" which is code for ""really pretty, but not in a way that provokes an erotic response.""  What freedom?  Everyone in this movie is a whore, and none of them seem to earn any grace or learn any worthwhile lessons.  What love? I'm not sure what any of these characters really love or believe in.
Maybe this film is escapist in a way that speaks to other people.  Maybe my fellow US citizens are as superficial as this movie seems to assume they are.  I doubt it.  I've never been this negative in a film review before, because I only review films that I see to the end, and I would normally stop watching a film this bad.Good lord, what a dog. AMENDMENT:  Apparently, there is some legitimate beauty in this film, as my wife assures me that Ewan MacGregor is a hot piece of beefcake.",Moulin Rouge!
712,PugsMom,Moulin Rouge:Dick Tracy...both overacted,2,4 June 2001,"DISCLAIMER: I walked out after 25 minutes so this is what I thought of what I saw and why I left.First off all the editing was too quick made me dizzy because I couldn't focus on one shot long enough to take everything in. I wanted to see all of the beautiful details but never got a chance. The sets, make-up and costumes were amazing, but again, I wanted the pace to be a bit slower. The music was wonderful and I especially liked the use of contemporary songs. What I couldn't stand was that I felt everyone was overacting. I know that was somewhat the point, but the overacting was overacted. I thought Kidman did a decent job as Satine but her character was just so ridiculous I couldn't help but wince at every line. And everyone elses lines too. I left right after her introduction to the Duke. So did my three other friends. This reminded me of when I walked out of ""Dick Tracy"". Oh well. I did manage to go to another theater and see Bridget Jones...thank God for multiplexes!!!",Moulin Rouge!

And have not seen R&J simply because the actors do nothing for me in it.  But about three weeks ago, one drizzly afternoon in a local store I saw the CD and decided to have a listen.  In todays society of croakers being passed off as crooners I was interested to see what sort of sound Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman would have.  I walked out of the store with two things.  One a copy of the CD and two a firm commitment to see the film when it was released two weeks later.Moulin Rouge is banquet, a gargantuan feast of sight and sound.  It screams Baz Luhrman, but's that's ok - it's his trademark.  Baz has assembled a cast that suits perfectly.  I didn't feel that there was one person who shouldn't have been there (however it was a bit of a shock to see ""Diver Dan"" in drag - Aussie readers will understand).As a self confessed Musicals freak, I had a predilection towards this film as I walked in.  The numbers are fantastic with ny hat going off to the ""Roxanne"" number, it reminded me very much of the three way song that The Phantom, Christine and Raoul do at the end of Phantom of the Opera.  I had an idea that Ewan could sing from Velvet Goldmine and Emma, but Baz has helped to fully develop a wonderful voice and set it free.  Nicole Kidman said that Ewan and herself have made a pact that they are not singing in pubs, clubs, parties, or generally in public though.  The one exception I hope they make is if the song is nominated for an Oscar.Well done to all involved, if this was a stage play it would be up there with the great stories like Les Mis, Phantom or West Side Story.",Moulin Rouge!

717,Jhetto,Gilbert & Sullivan Meets MTV,10,12 June 2001,"If Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" (1996) was Shakespeare for the MTV generation, ""Moulin Rouge"" is Gilbert & Sullivan on ecstacy.Laurmann's over the top portrait of turn of the century Paris is an explosion of sound and color that leaves the audience dizzy, disoriented, and begging for more.  Its so sad it's being seen by so small an audience. This is a big, bold, daring, tasty, entertainment extravaganza that blows the doors off the theater.  It's everything a movie should be, and then some.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are surprisingly appealing in their doomed love affair, and Jim Broadbent's brilliant turn as Zidler is in itself, worth the price of admission.  A send up of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"", with the rotund and whiskered Zidler as the blushing maiden should go down as a classic in cinematic comedy.  From the love triangle, to the play within a play; from the mustache twirling plots to the wild score and breathtaking choreography, Moulin Rouge stands in a class by itself. So inventive and so beautiful are the production design and cinematography that they could literally stand alone. Laurmann propels us through the mean streets of Paris at breakneck speed, treats us to a magical waltz on moonlit clouds, and even serves up a glittering green fairy and a chubby faced singing moon. He jams the screen with illusions to other films ranging from ""American Beauty"", ""Titanic"", ""Singing in The Rain"", and his own ""Strictly Ballroom.""  One can only hope that this under-appreciated effort will one day be recognized for the masterpiece it is.  Bravo Baz!",Moulin Rouge!
718,filmcrit-2,Gimme a Break!,4,14 March 2002,"OK, so I went to this movie on the recommendations of some trusted friends, as well as the raving reviews on this wonderful website. I must have missed SOMETHING, because this movie looked like hot garbage TWICE warmed over. The thing is, I thought the acting was great. This is the first time that I really, really liked a Kidman character. Admittedly, she was amazing as Satine. Unfortunately, when I left the movie my eyes were sore, my brain was confused and my constitution was generally appalled. All of the gawdy color, fast-moving cuts, close-ups of grotesque faces...who could deal? And besides that, Luhrmann had the audacity to make this movie 2.5 hours long! Are you kidding? I could've told this story in 45 minutes with hand puppets.This movie goes into the same garbage can as ""Speed 2: Cruise Control,"" ""The Haunting"" (no, I will never see another Jan de Bont movie as long as I live), and that tragedy on celluloid ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" Sheesh, I should've seen ""Pootie Tang."" 4/10",Moulin Rouge!
719,craig.tuohy,Predictable predictable,3,19 July 2001,"Boy, where do I begin.I hated this movie. Trying to sum up quickly what I didn't like isn't going to be easy. Let's start with the plot: I've seen Shakespeare in Love, so why watch an almost identical story about unrequitable love in the theatre?Especially one as predictable as this.The Editing: Fast and messy, with absolutely no finesse. I thought the camera movements and cuts would relate in some way to the tempo and flow of the songs, but instead we are treated to random zooms, spins and 50 cuts a minute until we feel (or at least I did) rather unwell.The Songs: What a heavy handed use of pop songs. A song about a prostitute? Oh, lets use Roxanne. In the name of love, Like a virgin, all you need is love, all too predictable. I was hoping for a really clever use of a song to make us see it in a different way. For me, the only tune that achieved that was 'Your Song' by Elton John. Unfortunately, this tune appeared during the most embarrasing scene of the movie.The Arrangements: This for me is where the movie really failed. Every song (bar Roxanne, which was brilliantly done) received EXACTLY the same treatment. That is, each number would start with a few spoken words, which would then progress slowly (oh, so slowly) into tune. then some strings or a keyboard comes in and the tune picks up pace a bit. Building to a crescendo of huge orchestral accompaniment and high pitched screeching and then...silence. The music stops and our star quietly sings the last line. Again and again. The unoriginal arrangement is hindered further by the fact that we already know all the words, so while the stars are plodding along we are already a verse and a chorus ahead, waiting for them to catch up. I HATED what they did with the songs in this movie.The Choreography: Average. I liked the Indian dancing at the end, but there wasn't enough of it shown. The Dancing during Like a virgin and especially the scene with the Duke in the Elephant were excrutiating.The Stars: Nicole Kidman was fantastic, with a solid voice. But Ewan Macgregor, Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo & especially the Duke fellow were all awful.The Directing: On the whole, fairly solid. The movie certainly had fantastic production values. However, the one thing that really grated me was Baz's use of a slow motion strobe effect to convey moments of drama. This technique worked best in Strictly Ballroom when our hero came sliding onto the dancefloor on his knees in the finale. It really hit you in the gut. But in Moulin Rouge we see the same trick every time Nicole had a little cough. Or when we saw the bad guy, or indeed in any moment of 'high drama'. This seriously diluted the desired punch and became way too repetitive. Also, using the exact same zooms and pans every time we go from Exans hotel room to the Moulin Rouge becomes so very tedious.Now you may have read this thinking that this movie is just not to my taste, but you'd be wrong. I loved Strictly Ballroom, Shakespeare in Love, Rocky Horror picture show, Priscilla Queen of the Desert, The Red Shoes, My Fair Lady etc. etc. I have nothing against musicals, or kitsch movies or any of that. On top of all this I was really looking forward to the movie. I just cannot praise a musical with badly sung, badly arranged & badly filmed tunes, that has a plot stolen from any number of other romantic drama/comedies and does absolutely nothing new with it except sprinkle on a bit of glitter.",Moulin Rouge!

I loved this movie, though at first it seemed like the sort of film I would hate, I was drawn in and by the end I was used to the continual breaking into song and sudden bursts of color or sweeping camera shots. Nicole Kidman is fantastic, I have never been much of a fan before, but I thought she was fab in this, she also has a surprisingly good singing voice. Ewan McGregor was also very good, I had never thought much of him before either. They had great chemistry and I loved their duets.Overall this film was fantastic, the story may be simple with the ending revealed early on, but look past this and you will see the magic of this film. it is the type of movie that makes you smile and want to break into song (maybe not..)A beautiful piece of film that is as colorful and crazy as it is original and touching.

722,orangecatdancing,gets better every time you watch it,10,28 January 2002,"The first time I saw ""moulin rouge"", I liked it well enough,  But witheach subsequent viewing it has grown and grown until it hasbecome one of my favourite films of all time.  This is not a film thatyou can be cynical about - you just have to let the emotions and thevisuals wash over you and envelop you in its magical charms. Ewen McGregor and Nicole Kidman are perfect in their roles, andhave such a realistic chemistry between them that you will forgettheir real-life personas and simply see them as Satine andChristian, starcrossed lovers in the most exciting nightclub at theclosing of the nineteenth century. Baz Luhrmann returns to the themes displayed in his previousworks, ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"". And although allthree are wildly different, they also exist in the sameLuhrmann-esque universe of the wildly hyperkinetic and tragicallybaroque. So much so they have been rechristened ""the red curtaintrilogy"". Lurhmann films are about emotion, and succeed with the viewer ifthey let themselves open to it.

723,applescruffy,Of course the story is easy!,10,3 May 2002,"I was reading some comments and I just couldn't believe there are still people out there saying: ""Lots of show, no substance... The story is worthless... Why does Satine fall in love with Christian after just one song... Unrealistic..."" Aaargh! I'm gonna direct this comment to those people: What are you, stupid?! When you heard the story of Romeo and Juliette for the first time, did you think ""How unrealistic, they only know each other for two seconds and already they're in love.""? It's supposed to be unrealistic, it's one of those dramatic love stories!Of course the story is simple,  of course it's a corny, over the top musical with silly love songs in it and a predictable ending. That was the whole point! It's supposed to play on the human emotion in the easiest way there is; with music, dance and simple but beautiful lines. You have to enjoy the singing and the dancing, you have to smile when they get each other, you have to cry when she dies, you have to get goosebumps during the final of the tango/Roxanne, you have to be dazzled by the colours and costumes. It's a show, a wonderful, cheerful, uplifting, easy for the eye and ear show! If you want to see a good story, go see Memento or something like that, this movie you go and see to have an exciting time and nothing more. So stop whining about the story!",Moulin Rouge!
724,crewgch,Possibly the best ever! The bar has been raised...,10,3 June 2001,"""Possibly"" is incorrect... Moulin Rouge is simply the best movie ever made. Star Wars was neat.  Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, the list goes on... all of these movies are special but ultimately fall short of Moulin Rouge... I can hear the angry voices countering this opinion as I type.Of course.  If the world understood all at once, every war would cease.  The world would change instantaneously and we all know that won't happen so the reality is that some people can't and won't ever be able to get the clues masterfully presented in Moulin Rouge.  These are the same group of people that think Wizard of Oz is simply a coming of age story. 
So yes, I'll say it again with even more conviction... Moulin Rouge is the best movie EVER made!The most amazing thing about this film is that most of the people in the sold out audience I sat with missed the point.  They totally didn't get it. In the Bible, it says that the truth is so simple that even a child could understand.  Yet somehow, inexplicably people miss the point. 
This movie expressed emotions like no other film has dared to attempt.  It grabbed me at my deepest point and then went even deeper.  Me and the four guys I watched it with were the only ones to watch all the way through the end credit sequence where Baz showed us even more clues.  I'd sift throught Baz's trash if I believed he was hiding more clues in there.  The director is a genius people - let's pay attention to this guy.  He knows something.I feel so lucky to have understood this film.  The message was so clear - and I am so thankful.Technically speaking, the film was flawless.  Absolutely flawless.  Every frame had intention.  The designers, the music, cinematography, choreography, editing, sound, and yes the acting.  WOW!  Ewan, Nicole, and the rest of the stellar cast were absolutely 100% amazing.  They poured their souls into this movie.  They're not putting teardrops into these actor's eyes - they gave every ounce of themselves to this movie.  Every single one of them should win Oscars.As for the director, I would do my best to honor your message.  Since I was one of the people that actually understood this film and I'm not saying I'm the only one - I'm sure thousands of people's lives will be changed from the film but the fact that everyone didn't get this film makes me feel like I'm one of the lucky ones.  To think some people walked out of this movie and made a comment like:  ""Well, the costumes were nice at least but I just didn't get it.""  That's scary!  They're at home choking on a mediocre life and that's too bad.Thus...I have an obligation because the truth has been handed to me so it is up to me to honor it... I will love like I've never been hurt, I will sing like no one is listening, I will dance like no one is watching-- I will love and I will be loved in return!Thank you Moulin Rouge...And yes I will write ""my story""... only the clued-in ones will get that.(1000000 out of 10)",Moulin Rouge!

But I did rent it just for kicks, and ended up loving it! I am in marching band at my high school, and our director chose the music from Moulin Rouge for next year's show. I was thrilled to hear the great news! I am very excited to find out what our show will end up looking like on the field next year! I can see why my band director chose this show for our marching band. Moulin Rouge consists of wild combinations of all different kinds of music. From artists like Christina A., Queen, Nirvana, Marilyn Monroe--everything! I'm afraid to use this cliche, but there is no other way to say it: ""I laughed, I cried, it was all-around perfect!"" I was very surprised to find myself enjoying the film. I even received it for my birthday! So, in conclusion, if you are kind of ""iffy"" on this movie--just go out and see it!

728,scottallendavis,Must see event,10,11 November 2002,"As you may have noticed from the other comments, people either loved this film or despised it.  That reaction alone should be enough for you to give this movie a shot and discover in which camp you belong.
Visually stunning, but so unconventional that scores of people will tune out immediately.  The first fifteen minutes are almost a test to see if the viewer can bend his expectations to a totally new paradigm.  According to the director's commentary, this is exactly what he intended.  Separate the wheat from the chaff early, let the audience know this will not be another generic musical (or film, for that matter) and then proceed with the fun. For the people that don't make it through the first fifteen minutes, thank Baz.This is a simple love story with a simple plot told in a very complex way. The movie begins by telling you the end so the viewer can enjoy the ride, and what a ride!The Moulin Rouge is about to become a real theater, with the help of the evil monied Duke.  The show being written by Christian (Ewen McGregor) to accomplish this 'Spectacular' transformation is a reflection of the movie character's own lives.  But wait!  This is a two-way mirror.  At times the stage show precedes the real action and at times 'real' life is written into the show.  At other times the show and life are happening simultaneously.*small spoiler* The movie is chock full of original ideas, my favorite being the use of popular music in the score.  The first time this happens you'll be asking yourself, ""What the heck is this piece of music doing in this movie?"", but once Ewen starts singing Elton John's 'Your Song' the device is revealed. Modern songs are used as the libretto of the movie!There has been much said about the singing talents of the lead characters, but I applaud Nicole and Ewen for having the courage to sing their own roles.  I guess Baz could have cast a 'real' singer like Madonna for the lead role, but unfortunately, she can't act.Give this movie a shot, and don't be tricked into turning it off before you see what it's really all about.10 out of 10",Moulin Rouge!
729,xphile63,Spectacular! Spectacular!,10,19 July 2001,"Okay, so the plot could have been a little stronger.  But in light of everything else that was good about this movie, the plot seems kind of irrelevant, don't you think?The really beautiful thing about Moulin Rouge is that it comes across as less of a movie and more of a very elaborate stage show.  The visuals and the music were what really made it great, especially the vibrant use of color and the hilarious popular music parodies (including Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" among others).  The deliberately over-the-top performances added to the effect.The beginning of this movie is incredibly corny, I'll admit, but not by accident.  Instead, it *revels* in its corniness, and that makes it excusable.",Moulin Rouge!

I was extremely pleased by the talent revelation of both Kidman & Mc Gregor. Nicole, has been full of surprises this year but this is a miracle. The blend of old and new songs with the legend of Molin Rouge was exceptional with the 'Like a Virgin' topping the show as it was performed by MEN????!!! I will class this as a rare sample of fine cinema, and will dare to compare it with other masters of the kind like Evita and Grease. The addition of a tragic ending 'amour', has given the film a touch of 'Love Story', with Ryan O'Neal and Ali Mc Graw.There's only one verdict. Get it and treasure it. 15/10!",Moulin Rouge!
731,naginata,A Dazzling Follow Up Masterpiece,9,6 January 2002,Ok not everyone understood what was going on in Romeo + Juliet and a lot of people probably were still confused with Moulin Rouge but I have got to say that Baz Luhrmann is a genius. His innovative way of seeing films is inspiring. I came out of the movie theatre for Moulin Rouge thinking I have got to see this movie again. It's just such a good movie.,Moulin Rouge!
732,MadMatt7,Only A.D.D. sufferers can follow it.,1,21 May 2003,"Seriously, how could anyone sit through this thing? After 5 minutes of this amphetamine-edited nonsense, I had a splitting headache. This movie could not sit still for one scene to let me catch up to what was going on. Not that I cared, anyway. No one in the film got a chance to even finish a song without the director jumping in and out of it like some hyperactive 3-year old child. Completely unwatchable.",Moulin Rouge!
733,serenity5,"you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love it!!",9,13 September 2002,"This film is stupendous! There's absolutely no mistaking the director's style, if you're familiar with his other work. This time, he uses the glitz and glamour of the Musical, and I think it works better than his Romeo & Juliet. I enjoyed that film, but Moulin Rouge is leaps and bounds better.Everything seems fresh and innovative, and as Ewan Macgregor's character says: ""if you're open, I think you might enjoy it.""so go in with no expectations: this is NOT your typical musical, it is Not your typical movie, it is simply divine!!",Moulin Rouge!
734,bdotson,A superficial depiction of love.,1,28 May 2003,"When will people figure out that you can't compensate for a lack of TALENT with glitz and glamour. Shaking the camera, inserting quick cuts and using over-the-top sets and costumes may distract some people from this atrocity, but some of us are insightful enough to recognize crap when we see it.This is absolutely the worse editing I think I've ever seen. (The fact that it was nominated for an academy award made me rethink every thought I've ever had. I'm afraid to leave the house now, because I think that was a sign of the coming apocolypse.) The cuts are far to quick and it seems to have arbitrary cutaways thrown in that make no sense whatsoever. It was impossible to follow, because there isn't a single shot in this movie that lasts longer than 2.5 seconds. All flashy cuts do is confuse the viewer. They aren't ""hip"" or ""cool"" or ""innovative"", they're just plain ridiculous (believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a professional editor.) The whole idea of editing is to cut the film together into a coherent story so the viewer can enjoy it-and this film failed miserably. All it did was give me a headache.  To be fair, the editor is a very skilled editor who probably was just doing her best with what that no-talent hack of a director gave her. I have to believe the A.D.D. style of cutting was his vision, not hers. Check out Road to Perdition or Elizabeth to see her true skills.
What was with the gratuitous slow-motion? Every other shot was in slo-mo for apparantly no reason at all.The singing made me want to sharpen a pencil and shove it directly into my ear. Seeing a fat man singing  ""Like a Virgin"" is going to cost me years of therapy and lots of sleepless nights. Kurt Cobain is turning over in his grave, and if I ever hear ""Your Song"" by Elton John again, I may set myself on fire to distract me from the pain. ...THE MOON SINGS! What the f**K?Not to mention, the story was awful. This was a just a very superficial depiction of love. The story is what holds a film together. No matter how pretty you make it, without a good story, it's just a complete waste of time. I shudder to think of some potentially great movie that didn't get made because this piece of crap did.I was EMBARRASSED to watch this movie, and I was alone when I watched it, so figure that out. If you are planning on watching it, might I suggest taking an entire bottle of Vicodin beforehand- 'cause it's gonna hurt.",Moulin Rouge!
735,SteveB Ohio,To critics who didn't like it: Don't quit your day jobs,9,15 July 2002,"I won't repeat what many have said here about the spectacular visuals, dancing and music.  All I will say about that is that this is the best musical I can ever remember seeing!  Whatever the critics may say to pick it apart, the sum of the parts is that this movie just plain works.  Period. Never mind Nichole Kidman's well-deserved applause, just imagine Obie-Wan belting out a version of ""Your Song"" that rivals Elton John's, and you'll get an idea of the unique quality of this film.It starts out a bit goofy and quickly turns chaotic, but then settles down to just good old fashioned music and dancing.  And through all of the visual and auditory spectacle, you begin to see that there really is a touching, if corny, story underneath it all.  The ending is truly tear-jerking.
I understand that some people didn't like this movie for the very reasons that make it great: it is bold and different.  If your idea of a good musical is along the lines of cute story that is written primarily to show off some new show tunes, you'll probably hate it.  But if have an open mind and understand that the main purpose of the cinema is to entertain us, then you'll have to agree:  ""Spectacular, Spectacular!""Oh, one more thing:  Given the subject matter, my kudos go to the director for keeping this film in good enough taste to keep it below an ""R"" rating. The film itself was not like the in-your-face rather slutty MTV video of ""Lady Marmalade"" that was used to promote it.  Although it had its moments of implied sensuality, I was able to watch this movie with my teenage daughter with no reservations.Bravo!",Moulin Rouge!

At 40something years of age I was laughing and crying at a musical the worrying thing is so was my boyfriend.I dont know where to start, it was visually sensational, the music was Fab. We were delighted each time another song came along that we knew (must buy the sound track), the casting fantastic, direction superb it even had a good story......well ok it was one big fantasy that I was happy to be taken into and given an emotional ride.",Moulin Rouge!

Ewan McGregor is fantastic in this movie, I fell in love with him the first time I saw his face and when he started to sing I almost passed out! Am I exaggerating? No, I´m not. See the movie and cry!

738,mia-manns,Moulin Rouge - a musical with a few magical touches,10,22 March 2011,"Moulin Rouge is a classic story of love-at-first-sight, with the twist of the hopeless romantic falling for a prostitute. I know we all claim to be tired of this sort of thing... but just stop whining and enjoy its charms. Please? For me? This film is complex enough to make that overdone plot line incredibly rich and fantastic. Christian is a writer who has come to Paris to experience the bohemian revolution, with a dedication to the ideals of ""truth, beauty, freedom and, above all things, love"". He falls in love with Satine, the Moulin Rouge's head starlette. The intriguing part of this story is what happens when Christian is mistaken for the Duke, an investor in the Moulin Rouge's production of Spectacular Spectacular, a play Christian is writing for a bunch of crazy bohemians. Satine wants to go from ""courtesan"" (or the hooker with the prettiest singing voice) to actress, and the Moulin Rouge will subsequently transform from ""night club"" (or glorified brothel) to theatre. But they need the Duke's money. He is creepily obsessed with Satine and demands that she... service... only him, in exchange for his funding. To make matters worse, he demands that the deeds to the Moulin Rouge be transfered to him in the case that there be any ""funny business"", which of course there is, because she is giving Christian free ""service"" behind the Duke's back.What's so good about Moulin Rouge? Well, to hook the classic rock lovers, it has showy covers of some really great hits - Your Song by Elton John, Heroes by David Bowie, Silly Love Songs by Paul McCartney, Roxanne by The Police, All You Need is Love by The Beatles, and The Show Must Go On by Queen. Also, Madonna, Nirvana, and Whitney Houston. So mostly great rock songs, but there is something for everyone. And who can forget Christina Aguilera with... OK I forget who... doing Lady Marmelade?The art direction in Moulin Rouge is fabulous... and weird. Very weird. It might take a second watch to really get into the weird comedy as well. Have a few drinks with your first watch and you'll soon find yourself chuckling at the absurd circumstances and nonsensical spectacles. Just trust me.Partway through there is a noticeable shift from ridiculous dance scenes to dramatic, tense ballads. Accompanying the shift in tone is Christian's transition from boy falling in puppy love to insanely jealous lover. Ewan McGreggor does a spectacular job here. Watch how long his goofy grin is plastered on that face, making him the picture of a man falling in love for the first time (don't you know it's gonna last) and then suddenly he is intense and crazed. Flashes of that innocent love can be seen in his expression later, making the transition incredibly flushed out and believable.You're really going to have to take a leap of faith with me if you haven't seen this. The first watch may even be too estranging, but just stay seated for the whole ride, and I promise you will like where you end up. Just... just trust me.",Moulin Rouge!
739,Bradd06,Outside it may be raining but this movie keeps on entertaining...,9,16 January 2004,"This movie captures the essence of theatrical art. It modernizes the stereotypical Hollywood Musical with a twist to 18-century Paris.

However, I was blown away by it especially as a big-screen experience, it was AWESOME. Never before or since have I seen a British cinema audience stand up and applaud a movie during the closing credits. For a visual and audio experience beyond all expectations, watch this movie. McGregor and Kidman have well-matched voices, and who would have thought either could sing so well. Jim Broadbent is, as always, OTT and immensely watchable. All the other characters are well-cast. The use of existing music tracks is genius, they are chosen well. Sets and costumes fantastic. I've just seen this again, and its as fresh and exciting as originally. Compulsive viewing - watch it please. Baz Luhrman rocks!",Moulin Rouge!
741,theimmortal18,Let's do the can-can! for this film!,10,1 February 2005,"Definitely the one of the best romance films of the century. The movie was done so well that it gives off something for teens to realize. Don't let your romance fall flat on it's feet. This movie almost is a guide into your romance. Don't let anyone push you away, and certainly don't let anyone tell you can't have what you want. The movie itself is fantastic. The actors were amazing. Nicole Kidman plays a can-can dancer named Satine and brought up to believe she was only worth what someone would pay for her. So you can understand her line of business.Ewan Mcgregor plays a sad romantic who has never been in love and actually realizes this when he's typing it on his keyboard. So then his friends, well, i'm not sure friends is what he thinks of them, but then pass him off as an English writer and they all went to the Moulin Rouge. Funny enough, Satine mistakes McGreoger for the Duke who is a powerful man who was willing to invest in the Moulin Rouge if he has Satine. Then the movie plays out into where the Duke invests in the show they tried to cover up when he accused Christian of foul play, and turns the Moulin Rouge into a theater. The movie shows fantastic work by Baz Thuriman and Nicole Kidman sparkles. Moulin Rouge shows us everything truth, beauty, freedom, betrayal, suspicion, jealously, and outstanding love. Moulin Rouge is a breathtaking experience and will leave your heart pounding. I highly recommend this to all, especially hopeless romantics. A",Moulin Rouge!
742,firenze_italia,More is more,3,20 May 2021,"Such a waste of incredible talent from the production design to the choreography to the actors and dancers. The dialogue is frequently corny AF, the sets are dizzingly overwhelming. It's the adult version of ""The Lego Movie"".

743,realdealholifield,"Not as good, or as bad as everyone says...",6,9 December 2005,"Moulin Rouge! The only movie I can ever remember seeing with an exclamation point in the title! But that's about the only originality you'll find in this film.Does Moulin Rouge have great musical numbers? Of course! But are they original? Moulin Rouge samples, ""The Sound of Music"", ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend,"" ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", ""Lady Marmelade"", ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""Like a Virgin"". The list goes on and on. It's more like a Puff Daddy Remix Album than an original motion picture soundtrack.How about the plot? A struggling writer competes with a wealthy man for the love of a beautiful girl. Nothing too original there.So surely it must be the dialog. Yet thinking back, the only phrase that's still ringing in my ears is ""The show must go on!"" A great phrase, but nothing Moulin Rouge can claim to have coined.Is Moulin Rouge a bad movie? Not at all. The chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor is excellent, especially when they're singing duets. And while a little neurotic at times, the movie never lags or leaves the viewer bored. Despite all my complaints, the movie was over before I knew it. So while I didn't like it, I can easily see how someone else might. My biggest suggestion here is to RENT IT before you buy it. Because, while it's not a bad movie, it's also not as good as everyone says.",Moulin Rouge!
744,Kyle007,"""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return""",10,5 March 2005,"What a movie!! I have to say i've never liked musicals, but the day i saw this movie it kept me thrilled during the 2 hours it lasts. I thought that it was impossible first to make love songs in the ambient of the Moulin Rouge for the fact that it is a cabaret and ""courtesans"" can't fall in love, but Bazz Luhrman did a great Job directing the movie and placing the songs in the right time to elevate this movie to a DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE.Won't say anything about the plot, because there are others who have already done that, and very well, but i have to talk about the songs, it is a subject apart, it begins with a song of David Bowie performed by John Leguizamo and it gives you the clue it is a romantic movie with a sad ending, and that song is the one that establishes the climate you'll feel later in the movie. Then we have Lady Marmalade performed by.......well we all know who perform that song. the next great moment of songs is when Zidler appears and the whole Moulin Rouge sings and dances by the rhythm of ""the can can"", a really aggressive song with a really modern sound. Then we have the introduction of ""Satine"" (Nicole Kidman) singing ""Sparkling diamonds"" and it shows us a Character that only loves material stuff, she doesn't care about love, thing is going to change when she meets Christian (Ewan McGregor) and he teaches her the meaning and importance of love. Then we begin with the great love songs of this superb movie ""Your song"" , ""One day i'll fly away"" ""The elephant love medley"" and ""Come what may"", what can i say about these songs, they are just too great to say something about them and those songs make you wanna see this movie again and again and again.If we should analyze the outfits and ambient of the movie, it couldn't be better, it is all colorful and filled with energy everywhere (you really see this is Bazz creation). It is everything red and there's a lot of fireworks everywhere, like celebrating love and life.Resuming, this a an experience that no one should miss, though not everybody shares my optimism, i guess they just can't understand it well, because this movie is really a MASTERPIECE, no doubt of that......",Moulin Rouge!

The spectacle, pace, eye candy, sheer entertainment make it hard to classify.As important as the plot is, this film upholds the best traditions of 'American Musical' - just enough story to hold together the music and show numbers.But I digress.

It is truly one of the most amazing film experiences I have ever had. The art direction is stunning. The colors are brilliant. The camerawork is out of this world. But it's the editing that truly makes this picture. Anyway, I absolutely loved the music. Thanks Baz and company for including some of my all-time fave songs. As for the two leads...who knew? I agree with everyone when asking ""who knew that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor could sing?"" But sing they do and what a great job they do. (I swear if Ewan ever releases an album of songs, I'll buy the first copy.)A favorite scene of mine is when Ewan sings ""Your Song"". Oh my God! I just melt when I hear that song. I also loved the scene where they're both singing on top of her ""elephant"" apartment and the ""Roxanne"" tango scene with Ewan singing another song at the same time. What an incredible scene.

With ""Pennies from Heaven"" and ""The Singing Detective"" there was some sort of rationale for the mix of fantasy and music tossed into the story. Here there's no rationale, there's precious little story, there's scant acting or singing ability displayed and there's absolutely zero chemistry between the leading actors. Contrary to one reviewer's comment here, I found this one totally self-conscious and completely contrived.And it's not that I don't like Buhrmann.

749,Kasheen,It is a step above the rest,10,19 June 2001,"The numerous references to Ewan McGregor's penis size (which you will agree with if you've seen Pillow Book)made me realize how self-conscious this film is.  After realizing that I just loved it all the more.  It is such a culture savy film and it really pushes in your face how insane mass media and pop culture is.  It is a film for people who are influenced by pop culture (just about everyone).  And also people who like to be entertained. Because the film does go over the top, it uses cliches to it's advantage. Unlike pearl harbor for instance in which each cliche was met with a groan and rolling of the eyes. Also after seeing Moulin Rouge everything else seems tired. It must have been quite a task to edit that baby though.  And there is so much foreshadowing. The food even foreshadows events to come. It was sort of shakespeare in love meets rocky horror or something and then take on some more song within a play within a story within a movie.  Which is great because it reinforces the whole theme of a moulin, its circular motion.  My favorite thing is when a film synthesizes its visuals, plot, and sound into a perfect whole.  Since 2001 I haven't seen it done but I think Moulin Rouge does a pretty darn good job.  Plus I was taken by how well the musical aspect worked with the plot.  Using already known songs really only strengthened their meaning because along with them came all of the things that those songs mean to each person individually.  And it also seems that they used the songs in homage and to make a statement, not just to make a profit.  So before you read critic reviews by people that probably didn't have the time to actually assimilate the visually complex film, give it a chance, pay attention and whether you love it or hate it, you can at least appreciate the brightness and unique vision that this film offers.  :)",Moulin Rouge!

Moulin Rouge is a visualy stunning and breath taking movie with lavish art direction, beautiful musical scoring, and colorful costumes. The music is great to hear and is sung in great form. And the acting while not on the same level as the technical aspects of the movie is still applaudable. However after the movie ended I felt empty and somewhat sad, this is because of how the movie concludes. From the begining of the movie right up until the end it is a fast paced and stimulating then like a stake through the heart the music dies and so does Nicole Kidman. The ending while an homage to many opera's like La Boheme is something that should have been happier, I would have rather seen the two live happily ever after.

The direction, costume design, cinematography and musical numbers are to die for... it´s wild, it´s crazy and at times absolutely hillarious (highlights?

Not because of the plot, or anything that could refer back to the 1972 movie (except maybe that both are period pieces: `Cabaret' during the decadent times right before the rise of the Nazi movement; and `Moulin Rouge' during the fin-de-siècle decadent bohemian times), but just the fact that it presented itself as a musical that totally throws itself in your face.  Why TC ever split with Ms. Kidman is beyond me  she is truly magnificent (her voice in some of the songs she performs sounds rather like Madonna during the early years  not bad). Funny, I've always had an aversion to the idea of visiting Paris (ever!), but after seeing this movie, I kinda, sorta want to go now.  Perhaps I, too, can eventually say, `The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.'  This is not for the faint of heart when it comes to drama, but it could just be me  I cry at the drop of a hat.

If you have the right frame of mind it will make the difference between enjoying or loathing the movie.  Do not go expecting a deep plot, original characters or important themes.  Also, do not go expecting a movie aimed at teenagers even though it occasionally looks like a video clip.  Go with the expectation that you will be seeing an amazing, dazzling, almost overwhelming theatrical musical. Expect to get major sensory overload in the first 20 minutes.

Art in any sense, music, cinema, architecture, etc. Whichever form. All is being brought to us by the almost forgotten form of cinema, musical. The film-musical had it's prime during a time of depression and war, which main purpose was to give a little joy to the people. During the fifties and sixties, they tried to make them a little bit more serious or to take big Broadway productions to the screen. But by the summer of love the musical was as good as dead.So now we enter the 21st century and a whole generation doesn't know what movie-musicals are all about. They have never seen films with Gene Kelly - Judy Garland - Fred Astaire. What Baz Luhrman did was great, create a modern day version of ""Singin' In The Rain"", a film packed with modern classic songs. ""Moulin Rouge"" is the same concept as ""Singin' In The Rain"", old songs covered in a new story. The only distinction is that Baz Luhrman also gave the old songs a make-over. So we have a musical for the MTV-generation. It was a bold idea which happened to succeed perfectly.Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent were wonderful. The art-direction, cinematography and costumes were spectacular and the choice of music terrific.In my eyes you can only hate this film, if you loath music or cinematography.

By the end of the first half hour of this film the entire cast and crew has tried very hard to bring themselves to meet your very definition of the most utter foolishness you can imagine. Then they go past it. So, the question is, are you going to take this film for what it is -- an absurdist satire on cynicism, if you can believe that -- or just think it nothing more than ridiculous? I decided to go with it and had two-thirds of a great time. You know exactly where the plot's going, you know how it's going to end, you know with all the silly archetypes you've been introduced to that it's going to have nothing but either flamboyant or sincere melodrama at the outcast. I laughed hysterically at this film, but I think it knew I was laughing at it. In fact the movie almost dares you to ridicule it, then tops your ridicule with a cherry and does the next most ridiculous thing you can imagine. I admire its audacity. It was laughing back at me. I can handle that. Really the only big drag about the film was the length of the ending and how it probably took itself a little more seriously than it had to at that part, but hell, you knew going in that it was melodramatic, didn't you?

He becomes acquainted with Henri Toulouse-Laudrec (John Leguizamo), a disorientated Argentinean (Jacek Koman), and several others. Well, they fall through his roof anyway. When they discover he is a writer, they want him to write a play, then get it staged in La Mouline Rouge (Translates as ""The Red Windmill"")""The Nightclub of Your Dreams!"" It is there he first sees Satine (Nicole Kidman) a beautiful, ahem, courtesan. They meet, fall in love, sing and dance...but all is not well. The Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) is determined to take Satine away from the Moulin Rouge and make her a star (and, it seems, his wife). But then Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) our nightclub's manager, discovers that our Satine is not very well... This is a beautiful film. (C'est Magnifique!)Anyone who says this is just like all the other films titled 'Moulin Rouge' (the flops from the 30's and 40's,) either cannot appreciate good things, or is lying. Running at just over 2 hours, some would say it's a little long, but it flies by with the help of some speedy cameras and beautiful performances. With some help from a few familiar songs (Heroes by David Bowie, Material Girl by Madonna, and Your Song by Sir Elton John, to name a few) and obvious hard work, Baz Luhramann has created the best musical since Grease. (C'mon, admit it, we all sang Summer Nights at one point) All the stars positively sparkle and there is strong chemistry between them all.   There are times when you laugh (When Zidler sings a famous Madonna reel to the Duke) times when you cry  (The tragedy off-stage about ten minutes before the end, I'm not gonna spoil it for the minority who haven't seen it) and times when you can only sit on the edge of your seat to see what happens (yeah, like I'm going to tell you when that is! ). It'll be a few months before the launch of Moulin Rouge on DVD over here, but if you're in a similar situation, it's totally worth waiting for. Someone asked me why the actors in this were so great. Y'know what I said?

759,MoulinRougeRules,Very simply...,10,27 January 2002,"It is the greatest film ever made.  Better than Citizen Kane.  It is the most visually stimulating, intelligent, amazing, unique, creative, and beautiful film ever made.  It's unique blending of so many genres and techniques should be heralded.",Moulin Rouge!
760,newcastleboy,Pure Unoriginal Trash,1,1 November 2001,Absolute trash. No originality. A pure cynical exercise by Hollywood to make as much money as possible with gross manipulations & boring visual effects & a non-existent script & third rate songs which are 80-100 years before their time. I give this one 1/4 out of 10 at best. Baz must be the most overrated director in movie history.,Moulin Rouge!
761,murdermystery77,All You need is Love!!,10,31 May 2008,"This is one of my favorite movies.Right up there with princess bride.The sheer romance is the key things.The glorious costumes and the awesome songs.this song takes some songs and puts it in a perspective,you'll never fathom,ever.this movie will make you want to get up and marry a poet.I love this movie passionately and the quotes are sheer brilliance.Ewan Mcgregor sings beautifully in this and John Leguizimo(?) and the bohemians provide comic relief during some of the dramatic times.this movie is not for everyone.but i love it:)If for nothing else go see this movie for the like a virgin scene.You'll never think of that song the same way.....God bless",Moulin Rouge!
762,scerevisiaety1,Everything wrong with American cinema,2,3 July 2004,"Lots of fabulous style...little substance. The acting in this film is very good. The cinematography and sets and costumes are fabulous. But the most important aspects...such as writing and plot, are pitiful. A cliched and boring tale that we've all heard and seen countless times before. At times pure style and a familiar tale can be simply fun. But in the case of Moulin Rouge, the use of modern music and lines out of context make it nauseating. Seeing Ewan spout out U2's Pride ""In the name of love..."" to Nicole Kidman was sickening. Obviously many people disagree with me, which is fine. But for my tastes, this film was vulgar filth. I apparently need to write more for this to take up ten lines so...that should about do it.",Moulin Rouge!
763,cruyff14,It's great!!!!!,9,10 July 2001,"I think this movie is the best movie I've watched this year. It's beautifully shot and the music is great. The only thing I might complain is the sad ending.... sob.... It's 1,000,000 times better than Pearl Harbor.",Moulin Rouge!

The acting is excellent and the singing fantastic, the songs that have been used for the film fit it perfectly.  I was captivated all the way through and wanted to applaude at the end in the cinema.  It is not often that we get a film as original as this.  Baz keep up the good work.",Moulin Rouge!
765,sandralfagundes,Ewan Mcgregor Steals the Show,9,16 April 2021,"I'm weak in the knees for a man in love on screen. Ewan Mcgregor plays a handsome, sweet, hopelessly romantic man in love very well. The way he sings like the line my gift is my song and come what May over and over again at the end as he's approaching the stage will melts any woman's heart. He has a nice but masculine voice and he sings with emotion in a role that demands it. The music is romantic and memorable. Everyone's performance is unique and well acted. The 2 leads have great chemistry together. It's a beautiful movie. I still remember the warm afternoon I saw it on and how much I sobbed. I wasn't expecting to be so blown away when I first sat down to Moulin Rouge. It will make you want to fall in love if you're not already.",Moulin Rouge!
766,paulcarm,This film is truly dire...,1,15 April 2002,"but what is even more disturbing, it achieved both critical acclaim and box office success. There is no denying Buz Luhrmann put a huge amount of effort into making what is at times visually dazzling, but that does not compensate for what is a lame story, and mostly poor performances. As a Scotsman I do like to see Ewan McGregor do well but this is his poorest performance to date, and even worst he spends much of the film singing despite the fact that he cannot sing. Nicole Kidman puts in a rather uninspiring performance and also struggles due to the fact that her voice is not up to what is required in this role.  Jim Broadbent, admittedly puts in an excellent show as the eccentric Harold Zidler, but that is one of the few redeeming features of this lacklustre film. As soon as the novelty of watching a musical set in Paris in 1900 with the music taken from a century later, wears off (which is ten minutes into the film), the viewer is left to watch a shell of a film, all style and no substance.",Moulin Rouge!
767,hosr1,Tremendous film,10,23 November 2001,"Nicole and Ewan are outstanding in this musical-with a difference. The performances are very fine indeed. This film marked the moment that Nicole's star rose above Tom's. The cinematography is breathtaking and deconstructionist. Baz Luhrman has achieved something remarkable with the heady cocktail of pace, lights, colour alongside a deeply subversive critique of Hollywood movie making. So ... you can watch this film as a modern musical, and if you like musicals you'll like it, if you don't you won't. But, watch it on a deeper level and watch Luhrman's wonderful deconstruction at work. Outstanding.",Moulin Rouge!
768,sprover,great filmaking...awful film,2,17 January 2002,this is a lavishly produced and carefully choreograffed musical. Yet is silly and painfully slow.  Skip it unless you are REALLY a fan of musicals and do not care much about plot or pacing. The choice of music is very clever as are the four character actors who dog the leading man and provide comic relief.  They are sort of a cross between the June Taylor Dancers and The Marx Brothers.,Moulin Rouge!
769,Savvas Stavrou,"Moulin Rouge!, A Masterpiece",10,23 July 2003,"The bad commercial campaigns of the best movie of all time failed to give Moulin Rouge! worldwide recognition, but alas, this happens with many great movies (e.g. Requiem For A Dream, Donnie Darko). The whole comparison between this and the new musical blockbuster Chicago is useless since they are both great movies but not the same. Still, Moulin Rouge! remains in the first place on the Best Movies list. This musical, comical, dramatical and action packed hell of a movie will satisfy the whole audience. It just needs to be given a chance. Never have I seen an audience stand up and clap, with tears in their eyes, at the magnificent movie they have watched.
   The story is very simple but very complicated at the same time, giving enough music, action and laughs for everybody's taste. The characters are very easy to relate to and the edge-of-your-seat directing gives edge to this masterpiece. Christian, a young writer arrives in Paris, against the will of his father, to seek a career as a writer. He meets a group of bohemians who are planning to set up a musical play at the famous club Moulin Rouge and they invite him to rewrite the story of their play but at the same time to lure the famous courtesan Satine as to star in their play. Satine confuses Christian with the Duke, who on the contrary is expected to sleep with Satine to finance the upcoming play. The confusion continues and finally Satine and Christian convince the Duke to accept to finance the play. As the play is made, Christian and Satine fall in love, but the Duke's rights to the play also count for the body of Satine. She is his. And so the lovers try to keep their love a secret before everything is lost. On the way, jealousy, betrayal and trust is needed for their love to be contained.
   Satine is portrayed by the beautiful Nicole Kidman who delivers an astonishing performance. Her character has so much life inside her which makes you fall in love with her. Nicole was truly the one for Satine, for her beauty and character match like no other. She did, in fact, break two ribs during the making of Moulin Rouge! Ewan McGregor, one of the finest young actors on the Hollywood A-List, plays the writer Christian with success. Christian is a three-dimensional character with feelings and compassion. Both of these excellent actors' singing and dancing skills help in the portrayal of their characters.    The direction is simply amazing. With the best director there is, what can someone expect? Baz Luhrmann shows us his creative and brilliant ideas through his direction, cinematography, editing and camera work. All of these factors give you a dazzling effect. The editing gives you enough to be kept at the edge of your seat and also to feel those small goosebumps running up and down your back. The music is absolutely fantastic. The idea of mixing old songs together and forming this huge masterpiece is just amazing. The original music created by Craig Armstrong, one of the finest, also has atmosphere and is truly brilliant.    Mr. Luhrmann also takes us comprehend the importance of the visual world of movies with Moulin Rouge! The whole movie is a visual attack, giving you enough colours to come back begging for more. It dazzles you amazingly and twists you around. The costumes are excellent and the sets are simply fantastic. The mixture of all of these given to you by the editing will leave you speechless and coming back to watch it over and over again.
   Moulin Rouge! is a movie for the people. It has something everyone can relate to. It has been an instant classic ever since it came out in the cinemas. The more you watch Moulin Rouge!, the more you get addicted to it and the songs can even make you sing along. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor show off their acting and singing capabilities and at the same time director Baz Luhrmann mixes them together and forms his finest masterpiece up to date. Moulin Rouge! makes you proud for who you are and will make you fall in love with it. This is a movie about Truth, Beauty, Freedom and above all thing, Love...Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 10/10 - A True Masterpiece",Moulin Rouge!
770,gerelove124,"At first a fast paced journey into Paris, then it slows down into a timeless tale about forbidden love.",10,28 February 2002,"This movie was so brilliant, I was shocked to see how America's response to this film was minor. This is a new age movie set in old times, yet it squeezes your heart and makes you want to get up and sing. It takes you on an adventure that no other film could possibly match up to. Moulin Rouge is a wonderful mix of comedy and love, but it is mostly about the deep love that kepps the two main characters, Satine and Christian, bound together despite the odds. Nicole Kidman is getting every ounce of recognition she deserves for her leading role, but I feel that Ewan McGregor is getting cheated for his spectacular performance. If anything he should have received the award for Best Actor In a Musical Or Comedy at the Golden Globes. Moulin Rouge should have gotten more attention than A Beautiful Mind, and all Moulin Rouge fans know it. THis film is a feast for the eyes and an opener of the soul. It's a ten across the board, and the critics shoul have seen the magic from the beginning!",Moulin Rouge!

Ewan was absolutely perfect, yes Nicole 's performance was great and rightly deserves the Oscar nomination, but where is Ewan's?!? His performance was better than Nicole's or anyone else they have nominated for best actor this year. I can't express just how much I enjoyed this movie.

772,hcandersonliu,Kidman & McGregor Shine!,9,11 April 2002,"""Mouin Rouge!"" is indeed the best musical I have seen in my whole life. As a musical fan, I truly consider this one a real classic which's even better than ""My Fair Lady"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""Broadway Melody"" and many other musicals. The splendor, the magnificence, the gorgeousness, everthing in the film is absolutely wonderful. To get to the point, it is the best musical ever! Both Kidman and McGregor give extraordinary performances, and their singing and dancing are even more surprisingly fabulous! Moulin Rouge!, under the great direction of Baz Luhrmann, sure deserves a 9 out of 10! And the performances of both Kidman and McGregor deserve at least 8.8! Hail Moulin Rouge!",Moulin Rouge!
773,diego_moita,A bling-bling and dumb marriage of Fellini & Brodway,1,8 September 2003,"This film is interesting just for 10 minutes. After that is very hard to pay attention to the visual excesses and the absolute absence of plot, story and decent music. It becomes just a succession of stupid repetitive video-clips. I tolerated it just for 40 minutes. After that, not even in fast forward. Want visual fascination? Look for Fellini's ""Amarcord"" and ""E la nave va"". Want good musicals? ""All that Jazz"" and ""Singing in the rain"".",Moulin Rouge!
774,BravesPaul,The best musical of all time!,9,18 June 2002,"Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman surprised most of the Moulin Rouge audience with their singing abilities in this film. Add to that a wonderful musical production, a great story, and great acting from top to bottom, and Moulin Rouge is my favorite film from 2001. (Believe me, that surprises me more than you.)That is especially significant considering that I have never liked musicals, and I have rarely liked such a love story. I suppose most teenage males wouldn't. But I saw, I liked, and eventually nothing could top it. The best reason for this, I think, is the soundtrack. I was absolutely taken aback by the music from this film. I bought the soundtrack, bought the second volume, bought the promotional score, and even ripped audio from the DVD that couldn't be found on any musical release.Of course, this film isn't for everyone, and the awards shows earlier this year have proven that. Still, Moulin Rouge was (in my humble opinion) the best movie of 2001, and one of the best of all time.",Moulin Rouge!
775,ilovtheend,Eye and Ear Candy,10,2 September 2002,"I love this movie! It is the third in Baz Lurhman's ""Red Curtain Trilogy"" and by far the most stunning. The same old story, told in an incredible way, Moulin Rouge follows naive Christian (Ewan Mcgregor) into Monte Martre, the world of sin. Here he meets the beautiful Satine (Nicole Kidman), and instantly falls in love. THe plot is predictable, but IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE! This film is a common story told in an extraordinary way. The sets are gorgeous, and Ewan and Nicole have got enough chemistry to carry the film themselves. The supporting cast is wonderful as well, but nothing can compare to the music. Sung by the cast themselves, the collage of modern songs in original ways will take your breath away! Heather",Moulin Rouge!
776,orjames7,Yikes! And I thought the Titanic was a disaster!,2,15 October 2008,"I am not quite sure where to begin. Was is the lack of original score? The lack of original dialog? The miscasting of most of the supporting cast? The really bad editing? The horrific ""story""? Lets start with the score. I am not sure how they got permission to ruin so many good songs by including them in this movie. At least there could have been some effort to slip in some original lines in some of these songs. But why be original, that might require some thought or effort.And the dialog is a string of many good lines (and some bad ones) from a wide collection of songs, movies, poems, and bumper stickers. If I was the writer, I would have used a pen name, because nobody would have given me work after this.I like John Leguizamo, but what the heck? And what was with casting people who cannot sing in a musical? Were all the talented people doing something else? Or maybe they just read the script first. I didn't know that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor needed work this bad.Maybe the editing wasn't really that bad. Perhaps the editor just needed to cover up the really bad script, the inconsistent cinematography, and the sheer lack of talent involved in the production of this film. If the editor of this film didn't drink before, I am sure he does now.And what is the point of the story? That no matter how hard you try for true love, everything will end horribly. I know, maybe the point was to see exactly what the audience would tolerate before burning down the theater.I am still a little speechless after seeing this. Stupid film class.",Moulin Rouge!

I think it is a cinematic masterpiece, and although already a modern classic, I have no doubt that it will,in the future,be considered not only a great film,but a CLASSIC FILM. Why? A.A touching and heartfelt LOVE STORY,brought to life by a brilliant director,and perfect performances by a talented and committed cast of actors.All the performances are flawless,especially Nicole Kidmans.It is her ROLE OF A LIFETIME !! B.Great songs(especially El Tango de Roxanne)which do not interrupt the story but rather tell the story.Stunning use of popular music to connect on a emotional level with the viewers. C. A totally unique visual style which once you adapt to it, will blow you away. D.This film has it all.Story,acting,music,comedy,tragedy; - the whole nine yards. Look at it this way.If you don't like it(how sad),you can always sell it on E-bay for about what you paid for it.So its really a no lose situation.BUT,if it does connect with you,you will be one happy camper,as this is a MUST SEE / MUST HAVE movie.

But I'm watching it this evening and I just feel like I have to say that I have loved this film ever since I first saw it back in 2002, I wore out a DVD copy because I watched it that much.Everything about it is sheer perfection, the sets, the lighting, the music, the costumes, the actors, the script, the coloring, the camera work...literally everything is just perfect to me.

A waste of money, time, paper and film among other things.  It's SO bad, it's not even worth saying anything else about.",Moulin Rouge!
781,Gregonar,Silly good fun!,7,30 December 2008,"Moulin Rouge is a great musical. It pushes the boundary of musicals in the way that many good recent movies have done: by mixing and mashing existing forms. Compared to say, The Matrix, Moulin Rouge has much more crazy mixing, but less finessing (not to say that the Matrix couldn't use more finessing). I particularly indulged in the thought that Moulin Rouge merges Disney with pornography. I doubt this sat well with the ""Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever"" crowd.I believe that musicals are best enjoyed as musicals. As a rule, the construct will bare its seams because of the fact that people simply don't break out simultaneous into song. For most traditional film-lovers, this will be a huge hurdle as the expectations of seamless film-making originates with the likes of Kubrick and Coppola and pop culture simply doesn't have the class to out do it.And while we're talking about class, the dirty down inside theory is that musicals, as per Bollywood, as per the main role of music in almost any country, is to serve as an aphrodisiac for the masses. Conversely, a high-brow is someone who proclaims to have found something more interesting than sex. The two sides are not likely to ever agree very much and for a class targeted piece like Moulin Rouge, disagreements on its quality are as eternal as the class differences that draw the lines.Even the most clever of musicals- ""Cabaret"" (1972) has its kinks. And the glorious musicals of old like ""Footlight Parade"" (1933) consistently have flimsy story lines that serve as loose filler between the fantastic musical vignettes.I got my kicks from the movie through the numerous times it cleverly breaks the fourth wall. Also I couldn't help but muse at the supposition where I could write/sing like the lead character. Having many musicians as friends and once being a fledgling musician myself, I know it's an effective vehicle of seduction.Ah, but how very low-brow of me!",Moulin Rouge!
782,nimmy1,Simply excellent,10,24 January 2005,"This is , at this moment, my favourite film. It's got everything. Firstly, Nicole Kidman, I know it's been said before, but she was born to play this part - she looks sumptuous, acts well and sings well. Ewen Mcgregor, ditto, but for the ladies.The film is a visual feast, especially the first 45mins - perhaps if there is a fault it is here, with a little too much going on on screen.The costumes and settings are stupendous.The music is brilliant, taking standard popular music and presenting them in a musical context - so even if you're not in to musicals, please do not let the tag 'musical' put you off - there's covers of Trex, Bowie, Elton John all superbly done.There's humour, pathos, melodrama, delivered with brilliant timing by all the cast.So if you like beautiful women, handsome men, a good pantomime baddie, great music and a visual feast, you needn't look anywhere else.",Moulin Rouge!
783,james_mower2003,Obi Wan stop shouting....,6,6 February 2005,"Nicole could sing... Ewan shouted. Nevertheless, with Moulin Rouge Baz Luhrmann delivered another visually stunning film, similar in style to Romeo and Juliet. I like this pop culture take on the musical. Hollywood just doesn't make musicals anymore, and its interesting that this one was shot entirely in Australia. Moulin Rouge is unusual. The leads give their best, the supporting cast is great and I quite liked the music. However, in saturating the film in song, Luhrmann doesn't really let the characters develop. Moulin Rouge looks pretty and is certainly different. I did just buy the 2 disc DVD and the extras are great.",Moulin Rouge!
784,SuleKalmis,musical dram,8,18 August 2013,"The scenes that affected me at most were the Roxanne dance scene and the last 10 minutes. I did liked the costumes as well. Music was original and high quality. Actually, I am quite used to dramatic or highly emotional scenes in love movies however the last scene was perfectly effective and made me cry. I did not like male main actor and the Duke in terms of their acting. Nicole Kidman was amazing and it is hard to believe that she has broken ribs etc and is on wheelchair in many of the scenes. I believe that this movie will be very meaningful to those who currently fell in love and bears to take any risks to maintain their love.",Moulin Rouge!
785,margarida_saramago,"Good acting, good songs, good everything! Two thumbs way up high!",9,25 June 2005,"In my opinion, this is one of those movies which are true Hollywood material. What's Catwoman or Elektra next to this? I understand that people don't like to see musicals, or that they don't like to see what appears to be a perfect love story, because they think that's not real. I mean, I think that's the reason because some people didn't like this movie. But anyway, this movie it's absolutely awesome, fabulous, and it has everything (director, story, actors, music, ...) just great. Let's begin with the director, Baz Luhrman. This man really knows how to tell a story in the big screen, we can see that in ""Moulin Rouge"". OK, some of the camera moves may be a little bit extravagant, but, let's face it, it couldn't be better. It adjusts perfectly to the movie! The story... Oh, the story... By the tag lines it seems like a true cliché. Love here, love there, and they always seem happy, so we think that's just one of those ""and they lived happily ever after"" stories, and that's why I think that this movie it's worth watching. I mean, it's a true love story, ""a story about love overcoming every obstacles"", but the end it's simply genial... We get so into the story that we really wish it has a perfect ending, but it doesn't. Some of the people who left the movie in the middle may think that the movie is rubbish, but that's because they didn't stick around until the end. Last but not least, the Actors. First, Ewan McGregor. That guy has a talent to sing AND to act. That's unusual in this days. I think he was extremely convincing in his role, because he allows us to see the despair of the lost of our love, and he shows us the life, the ideals and the bohemian Paris in a way that is worthy of an applause. Now, Nicole Kidman. Not as good as Ewan McGregor, but also convincing and very romantic. She also allows us to see the rules and the life of a french prostitute in the end of the 19th Century. Now, just a synopsis of this comment. I think that this movie is great, very well directed, with a good choice of actors and excellent adaptations of many musics. Very good movie.",Moulin Rouge!

The story couldn't be more simple, but it's told (in the first half) in a frentic way that intercalates raw emotional moments of singing with the ecstasy of the boemiam life, some scenes are a bit cringy, but that's ok, it's Baz's style.All the actors go well in the movie, but Kidman and McGregor stand out for me! They can sing!! A lot!!! Great performances paired with some great musical moments.The thing is, when the Elephant Medley scene ends (""You're gonna be bad for business, i can tell""), i'm completely surrendered to the movie and it's blowing away my expectations.The second half of the movie is less energetic, as the movies slows down a bit to reach the fatal conclusion, which is the first information given to us at the beginning, but as the movie progresses we tend to forget that (a reminder here and there) in the middle of that beautiful chaos.It's definitely one of the best movies i've ever seen, i saw it countless times now and it still holds up till today as the best musical ever in my opinion and the best way to tell a love story, simply magical!",Moulin Rouge!
787,musicalmaniac09,Moulin Rouge was spectacular!!,9,17 May 2005,"I thought Moulin Rouge was spectacular!! The vibrant costumes, sets, and characters made the whole movie come alive in it's own sense. I was amazed to see two actors I'd never known could sing (Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman) project such astounding voices! I loved all the little musical jokes in the movie like McGreggor belting out The Sound of Music to McGreggor and Kidman singing a wonderful medley of classic songs. I loved the conflicts and ""close calls"" that all of the characters faced in this movie. Baz Luhrman put a magnificent twist on a basic ""love-triangle"" plot, making it one of the most amazing, funny, tear-jerking movies I have ever seen.",Moulin Rouge!
788,schroederana,Favorite movie of all time!,10,27 May 2017,"I normally do not like musicals, but the thing about this movie is that it doesn't only focus on the musical aspect of it, but it has romance, comedy, drama, and everything else you want in these kinds of movies. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgreggor really embody their characters in such a way that you actually fall in love with them and their relationship since the beginning of the movie. There are no words to describe how Moulin Rouge is a true masterpiece and in my opinion, it is not given enough credit as it deserves. Making a musical is hard, but making a good story out of one is even harder and the story of this movie is really creative and there is nothing like it. I hope everyone watches it and enjoys it as much as I do!",Moulin Rouge!

People will dress as their favorite characters, shout out lines at the screen and sing along.Where this movie succeeds -- it is brilliant.  But the plot is as predictable as they come, the quality of the singing is merely adequate, and the scenes that fail are laughable -- and not always on purpose.This is a daring movie -- but one that, ultimately, fails.  It is worth seeing only to encourage the writers, directors and actors to keep taking risks.  And -- yes -- it is worth seeing for those few scenes that soar (like the narcoleptic Argentine who sings ROXANNE as a tango).",Moulin Rouge!
790,koobs,What were they thinking?,1,3 March 2002,This movie is bad.  Remember how bad Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was?  This one ranks right up there as one of the worst musicals and one of the worst movies ever made.  I've lost some respect for the Academy Awards process since this movie was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Terrible stuff!  Save your money and rent something...anything...else.,Moulin Rouge!
791,Bimpen,Giv'em a history book!,1,4 April 2002,"These dreadful anachronistic scenes make me sick! Why pretend to be in the year 1899 and play music that belongs, for instance, in the seventies? Furthermore, it's not sufficient to have Nicole Kidman rolling around on the floor in black lingerie. A god movie has to have more than that. And Moulin Rouge simply hasn't. I fell asleep after the first hour. 1/10.",Moulin Rouge!
792,kiki-13,Devastating!,9,14 January 2003,"This is the second time I have seen Moulin Rouge.  I can easily say that it is an amazing film!  If you have not seen it... rent it or buy the DVD. After seeing Nicole Kidman's work on this film, I believe she will walk away with the Oscar this year for The Hours (as the Academy sometimes does). Her role was incredible  and she did a fantastic job in it. Her singing along with Ewan Macgregor's is amazing.  They had so much chemistry going on.  I can't believe he was overlooked by the Academy last year!  This is a film that explodes with color... and energy.. romance.. despair.. and of course love. I can't say enough about this movie.  Yes.. it is an MTV style film, but the editing, the cinematography and originality (even thought they use old songs) are all top rate!  I am very glad that I own this film in my DVD collection.  9 stars out of 10!",Moulin Rouge!

Her portrayal of Satine is quite simply incredible. Ewan McGregor also turns in an incredible performance. Although I've been a fan of his for quite some time, this movie should show the whole world how good he is. The camera work, effects, supporting cast (John Leguizamo in particular), and the amazing soundtrack are also superb. Baz Luhrmann proves once again he is one of the best directors around. This movie deserves many, many, many awards. Now I have to go. I'm going to see it again!",Moulin Rouge!

Outstanding costumes and sets.  Great acting, singing, choreography.  No matter what this does at the box office it has to get nominations for cinematography and editing.I've probably seen most musical ever made for the screen and probably another 50 on and off Broadway and this film stands on it's own and sets a benchmark for others to aspire.This is undoubtedly one film I will never be able to forget.",Moulin Rouge!

This is the most amazingparade of colors, music, actors, grandiosity, operatic drama I haveever seen in a long time. I had the sensation of watching asucession of Impressionist paintings. This is a feast for movielovers all over the world.",Moulin Rouge!
796,tdewey,"The most daring, inventive, kinetic, sweet and fabulous film of 2001.",10,4 June 2001,"Let me begin with a quick aside to a few of the other reviewers. Never, ever review a film that you haven't seen in its entirety. Doing so reveals an incredible contempt for the medium.Moulin Rouge is quite simply the best film to come out of a major Hollywood studio in quite some time it compares favorably to Fight Club (the movie), Rent (the musical) and One Hundred Years of Solitude (the book).Whether you like it will depend quite a lot on you. You can't just sit and watch Moulin Rouge like you would a simpler movie. You either accept the Universe Baz creates or you don't. I personally find Baz's world exhilarating and embraced it gladly.While the triumph of Moulin Rouge is ultimately the director's--he couldn't have gotten there without wonderful performances by his cast and company (and crew). The cast is exceptional and well chosen. Kidman shines as the courtesan Satine. Her voice is surprisingly warm especially in the Sparkling Diamonds and I'll Fly Away numbers. Ewan McGregor is (as others have mentioned) the real surprise--should he choose he could junk the Movie Star life for the Rock Star life.The supporting cast is, if anything, even better in their roles. Jim Broadbent is simply spectacular--and Oscar worthy--as Zindel. Roxburgh has the toughest role in the film (the villain Duke) and handles it expertly. Leguizamo's (Toulouse-Lautrec) lisp is somewhat off-putting--but apparently true to life. Regardless his energy wins you over by the end of the movie.After my first viewing my single strongest feeling was shock that such a movie made it through the studio process (Fight Club generated a similiar feeling--wasn't that a 20thCentury flick as well?). I can not recommend this movie enough--it is one for the ages. Don't wait for the video or DVD this movie demands to be seen (and seen again and again) in the theatre.",Moulin Rouge!
797,philomot,Does Mary Poppins ring a bell?!?,4,5 October 2001,"This movie has the look and feel of a Disney animation/live action movie. The plot and the storyline are very similar to Disney movies. Even the singing reminds of animation films like The Lion King. This is a kid's movie. The only part I liked is almost at the ending where Satine and the Duke have to 'consummate' their relationship. For the rest it's pretty bland and unsurprising and that counts for photography, story and setting. I recommend Terry Gilliam movies if you want some real substance.",Moulin Rouge!
798,privatesf,A post-modern masterpiece,10,30 May 2001,"Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" is a dizzying, completely over-the-top post-modern masterpiece of filmmaking. Daring, funny, tragic and above all exhilarating , this hyperactive musical is the shot in the arm filmgoers will desperately need after suffering through the latest bloated corpse of hype passing itself off as a movie. This film may not be for all tastes, but for those who are willing to try something daring and different, you will not be disappointed.",Moulin Rouge!
799,JamBap,Baz tries too hard,1,11 June 2001,"Well for me this is a groundbreaking movie, I don't think I have ever hated a film from the opening '20 Century Fox' intro. Poor Baz gives us a fine example of how success can inflate the ego so that it becomes very hard to focus on creating a humble, sincere and thoughtful piece of work. He takes the elements of Romeo & Juliet that make it such an original masterpiece - ie. unique fresh fast paced camera work, extravagant 'in your face' sets and costume design and an intense depth of emotion - and blows it so far out of proportion so that he thinks it can't possibly fail.Baz, you struck the balance perfectly in Romeo & Juliet, there was no need to try and blast our socks off by making the ride louder and wilder unless it had other elements that would have made it fitting. That would make for a very intense piece of work and this wasn't intense, it was a flimsy story with no depth that simply did not merit the movie's extreme style. It's like taking a boring song and trying to make it sound amazing by playing it at a ridiculously high volume. It doesn't work and will only impress listeners that get excited from sensory impact but have no idea about substance.  Well it seems to have worked as it's a box office hit and the majority of reviewers on IMDb were so overwhelmed that they couldn't tell that the movie was just that metaphoric cacophonous noise. I am a little sad that so many people think that ""those who don't like it, don't get it"", you've obviously been left so dizzy from the ride that it's hard to see that there was nothing going on under all the glitz and glamour to GET.The only thing I thought was original and did work at some places in the movie was the use of famous pop songs as the message that the characters were trying to convey, but I feel it was still wasted on a movie that fell apart on every other level.Please Baz put away your BAZMARK INC. label and stop trying to take movie making to even giddier heights because you are getting a little out of your depth. I know you'll probably hate me for saying that but hey, I wasted $12 on it so I'm still a little peeved ..............2/10",Moulin Rouge!
800,robzillatx,"Visually stunning, funny AND touching!",10,26 July 2001,"As the credits were rolling, I just sat there stunned, still trying to absorb everything from this unique movie.  The sets and costumes were spectacular, the music was energizing and the movie was filled with funny, strange and touching moments.  I didn't know what to expect going into the theater, and I'm still not sure what I experienced.  I just wish the soundtrack had more of the original music from the movie!",Moulin Rouge!
801,eunicem,Rocky Horror Show at Studio 54,1,3 June 2001,"Having loved Strictly Ballroom, I was looking forward to seeing this film. I could see what the director was trying to do: The Rocky Horror Show at Studio 54 as performed by Monty Python's Flying Circus, with scenes from ""Oh What a Lovely War"" and ""Peter Pan"" thrown in for good measure, but I found it a bit too much.  The colors were too vivid, the editing nauseatingly fast, the sound system seemed to have blown a fuse, and the pathetic mewing of the two leads made me nostalgic for the great days of Howard Keel and Katherine Grayson.  What ever happened to singing lessons or dubbing?  The singing was too week and the songs too brief for me to recognize any of the songs.  I kept wondering who had given Baz Luhrman all that money to make this film. I like both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, but I did get tired of seeing close ups of ghostly pale Nicole's smudged scarlet lipstick, and listening to her flat Australian twang.  OK, I'm picky picky, but with the money she earns she could afford to take elocution and singing lessons. 
The file had one truly superb scene for me: the violent Tango/Apache Dance which no low dive in Paris was ever without.  It is many years since I saw one and this was excellent.  The other dance scenes of the Can Can were far too brief but what little glimpse we had showed it as it likely was rather than the dressed up ""tourist version"".  The choreography, costumes and set design were all that made this movie bearable for me.",Moulin Rouge!
802,clubmike00,Phew!,10,21 December 2001,"I just finished watching Moulin Rouge and I could kick myself for missing it while it was in the theaters!  I don't think a film has ever touched me so deeply on so many emotions.  It is a feast for the eyes.  The plot, while familiar, is at once hilarious and terribly sad.  The players are wonderful.  Certainly, this film is a masterpiece and deserves the Oscar for Best Picture.",Moulin Rouge!
803,psycho-dj,This film proves that musicals are NOT dead!,10,8 January 2002,"I expected this movie would be good, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out this movie wasn't just 'good'...it was great...fantastic...absolutely excellent!     Growing up in musical theater, I've always had a great respect for musicals, but I was also aware that in this day and age, musicals don't usually fly with the public like they used to.  It seems to have become an era where ""reality"" entertainment is what people want to see, but this movie shows that the old fashioned musicals and fantasies are still alive and well. This film was obviously done right.  It had the traditional musical movie aspects of it, but it also included modern music in its score, which made it appealing to the younger crowd.  Like a long ""MTV"" music video, but without getting away from the charm of such a genre.     Not only were the musical score, the actors and the sets excellent, but it was such a great story.  I'm not exactly into the mushy love stories, but I found myself getting lost in the movie...like I was there..and that IMO is the purpose of films and television; to escape our everyday lives for a little while.  Obviously this film was successful in doing that.     It's nice to know that in the age of 'reality' TV shows and programming, that a film such as 'Moulin Rouge' still works, and we still have the opportunity to see a movie that we can get lost in.",Moulin Rouge!
804,benjamyn47,truly unlike anything,9,13 June 2001,"when i went to see this movie, i was just at the movie theater with friends and they picked it.  i had no desire to see it because i had seen the previews and was not impressed.  but i guess it had to be better than most other choices this summer.anyway, as the movie began, it was what i expected.  too much singing and dancing to tell an actual story, especially for a man who doesn't like musicals.  as the movie progressed, i could see the underlying theme of the movie show and it was presented so beautifully i could not turn away.  this is one of few musicals where the actors don't get out of character to sing. i admire the makers of the film because it seems they had a story to tell and didn't care what others would think, but wanted to tell it in their own way.  a truly artistic film with spots of humor in the right places. 
the people i went with were not so sure about the movie, but i could not get it out of my head for days.  definitely a great movie!",Moulin Rouge!
805,jintz,Love it or hate it.,10,15 March 2002,"The definitive film to divide both critics and cinema-goers, Moulin Rouge is a film like no other. From the moment the curtain glides up, the audience are swept along on an outrageously extravagant anecdote of truth, beauty, freedom and above all, love. Luhrmann's undeniably ambitious film is a two hour immersion in colour, sound and emotion that leaves your body saturated with a euphoric exhilaration that precious few other films can provide. I will not pretend that this film is the best that you will ever see, for as much as I enjoyed it, I am inclined to agree with some of the more cynical reviewers on this board that certain inclusions are questionable.However, to examine it short comings would detract from what is a spectacular cinematic experience. If one can watch this film with nothing more than mild curiosity, then I am sure that you will enjoy it immensely. Pleasures such as this should not be overlooked hastily, you might well be surprised. Delightful.",Moulin Rouge!

I mean a film with ewan mcgreggor and nicole kidman?? Both of whom have had pretty poor results of late in my opinion. After the first 30 minutes though I have to admit I was taken by surprise. And was really looking forwards to the rest of the movie.It didnt fail to live up to the opening. The acting was great, the singing better, and Baz Lurhman's unique filmic visions have once again triumphed here. Whoever said the musicals were dead?? Well whoever it was I just have 2 amazing things to say to them: Dancer in the Dark and Moulin Rouge!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
807,angelkiss84,pointless,1,5 June 2001,"i thought the movie was going to be so great since i love the lady marmalade video. but i was very disappointed. first of all, the set was so fake, it only have a fake eiffle tower and a little hotel and of course the ugly moulin rouge. where is the street? where is the people? the movie was suppose to look like it had been set in paris, not on the little dirty corner. and plot was so corny and the actors could've talked more instead of sing. the moulin rouge suppose to have tons of beautiful women, but only Nicole kidman looked decent to me. everyone else was old, ugly and fat, the moulin rouge seems like a pig show instead of a night club. however, there was few funny part but still, i would never see this movie again.",Moulin Rouge!

809,Abi Khoo,Spectacular Spectacular,9,26 June 2001,"So delighting, so exciting. An amazing film, who would have thought Nicole Kidman could look so amazing and play the role of a prostitute with such skill...she definately shined especially in the comedy scenes such as when she was attempting to hide her lover, Christian from the Duke...and that voice, she certainly can carry a tune very well....i would have to say she did a much better job of singing than Gwyneth Paltrow in Duets. The background of the film, created by special effects was very impressive as well. The dance moves and the directing were superb. However i feel that most the credits of this amazing film lies in its musical section, throwing in all types of music from all over, from ""the hills are alive with the sound of music"" to ""diamonds and a girls best friend"". The whole concept of where the origins of the songs though not at all logical or making sense... but then again... it's not suppose to be seen that way. Enjoy the film, as a musical, as we've not had such an amazing and spectacular musical in the cinemas for a long time.",Moulin Rouge!
810,scullystwin42,"Unbelievable story, dancing, music, acting",10,14 June 2001,"Being a big fan of Baz Luhrmann, I was expecting a lot from Moulin Rouge. And it delivered!  Everything about it was amazing.  A review I read said it takes cliches and pulls real emotion out of them.  And I agree. Everything felt new, even though it's been done a million times before.  The acting was superb - Ewan Macgregor was so heart-wrenching.  My friend and I were falling in love with him as he sang to Kidman's Satine.  He was perfect.And Nicole Kidman has the only person who could play this part.  Her expressive eyes and perfect turn-of-the-century looks matched the background superbly.  She evoked memories of Jean Harlow's silliness, Marilyn Monroe's sexiness, and created in Satine a gloriously contradiction - the naive prostitute.  More than a hooker with a heart of gold, Kidman's Satine is childlike, even in her seduction of Christian.  Her painful coming of age, brought about by the duke, was wrenching and amazing.
Baz's direction and vision are extraordinary.  I fell in love with his vision the moment I saw Strictly Ballroom, and Moulin Rouge keeps it going.",Moulin Rouge!
811,dkfriend,What a celebration of love!,10,23 September 2001,"This movie has moved me in ways no movie ever has! It tells the story of two love-struck people (Christian & Satine - Ewan McGregor & Nicole Kidman, both great!) but their love is forbidden. The scene is the Moulin Rouge in Paris in the 19th century, that is A LONG TIME AGO, but still the movie has much more appeal than your every-day romantic movie. It is a musical, and both Nicole Kidman & Ewan McGregor does a great job singing...it makes it even more believable to watch them fall in love...and even though their love is overwhelming, they have to overcome many obsticles to be together - and I will not reveal here whether they actually do or not, but them bottom line - AND - silver lining is that this movie truly is magnificent! Baz Luhrman has, once again, created a masterpiece, following the great success of Romeo+Juliet.Above all this story is about love! And what a story!",Moulin Rouge!
812,e_spartacus40,Trapped in a cruise ship cabaret show about love.,1,26 December 2001,"This is about the worst movie I've ever seen.  It was like being trapped on a cruise ship and forced to watch one of their awful cabaret shows where everybody is singing at you constantly.  Moreover, all of the songs, the story and everything else in the movie is about love.  It is highly repetitious and overly sappy.  It makes an obvious and weak attempt to pull you down emotionally and then lift you back up.  It never worked for me.  The plot was too transparent, and it happened in microcosmic waves that repeatedly hit you in the face over and over again to the point where you can no longer stand Elton John's wonderful song, ""You're Song""--or whatever it's called.  Apart from a few mildly humorous moments and the sight of Nicole Kidman (better to see Eyes Wide Shut for that) the movie was greatly disappointing.",Moulin Rouge!
813,neonexus,I never wanted it to end!!!,10,24 June 2001,"There are as many bad reviews as here are good ones out there for Moulin Rouge, so I had to see it for myself.  The previews showed a lot of glitz and a lot of glamour, but no real substance to the plot or characters, so that's pretty much what I expected; a good looking film and not much more. I'm glad to say I was mistaken.  Of course, the film is visually dazzling, not just from the sets and costumes but from Baz's nifty trademark directing also. Nicole Kidman, (whom I never really used to like very much) was outstanding, beautiful and in every way stunning, as was Ewan McGreggor, in this gorgeous fairy tale Romantic romance.  A story about 'Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all Love', Moulin Rouge is, in a word, SPECTACULAR!!",Moulin Rouge!

The story itself has no dead air (except the first few scenes cause that's where the build-up happens) but it's all so good! It's 2021 and this movie is 2 decades ago. So I think the VFX would look great if I were to watch it in the same year it was released, unfortunately I still wasn't born. But overall, it was great, the mixing of modern songs in the movie like Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" is a classic. And this movie has the same type of origin with ""Burlesque"" but it has the same color pallete and visualization as Lemony Snicket's ""A Series Of Unfortunate Events"" which I loved so much. Everything was very intimate and passionate, although I didn't like the visual special effects put on since we are in a year which has better vfx than that but again, since it was made in the 00's, it is very pleasing.",Moulin Rouge!

Musical dramas have been pretty rare for the past 10 years, because of this, Moulin Rouge becomes a unique movie viewing experience. The direction is in many ways similar to that of Romeo & Juliet (after all, both flicks were made by the same director). Though actor performances are somewhat exaggerative in the first half of the show, their performances in the latter half more than makes up for it. The production design is ornately resplendent, not to mention the striking costumes. I call this ""a common love story repackaged in a new way"". This is a must-see!!",Moulin Rouge!

The musical numbers were done quite well, and I found a good bit of humor in the usage of modern-day songs in the storyline.  I appreciated this movie much more after the second and third viewings.  Ewan McGregor does a more than credible job of carrying his role, and I wasn't aware he had such a piercing tenor.  I was not put off by some of the camera work and visual imagery as some other reviewers - I found the frequently changing camera angles to be much more of a visual enhancement than a distraction, which added to the overall effect of the film.8/10",Moulin Rouge!

How anybody could muster even the slightest interest in the ultimate fate of the two principals is beyond me as Luhrmann's preferred style (dazzling though it may be) has the disadvantage of driving us away rather than pulling us in.

I rented it with very low expectations (I had listened to the critics). However, from the very beginning, I was hooked. The clever usage of modern songs helps to quickly familiarize a time that myself and many others aren't really familiar with). Then, you get to see the bright colors of the Moulin Rouge and the images (if not the songs) you won't be able to shake for weeks. The only criticism I have to offer is of the soundtrack which is good, but where is Zitler's Rap, Spectacular Spectacular, and Like A Virgin? Anyways, for those of you who have not seen it because you heard from someone that it was bad, be bold and go out and rented. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a few dollars at Blockbuster.

I was not impressed and couldn't help but groan when they began to sing Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' as a dance number.  It's like taking the lyrics of 'Rage Against the Machine' and putting them in a Hansen video... the two just don't fit together, and taking the music out of it's context like that completely negates what the original artist intended.  (a la Disney's sanitizing of Victor Hugo's political satire 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame.')Aside from the music, my only other complaint was the BLAH message the film repeated OVER and OVER and OVER again by Ewan McGregor.  Love is good, Love is Great, Life is Love, We all need Love, Life is meaningless without Love....  etc. etc. etc...I kept expecting the film to get a little deeper, or at least try to explain why love is good... but it didn't.  If you want a great love story, there are a whole bunch out there that are much better than this film.That said, the supporting cast were entertaining... and the overall look of the film is definitely impressive if not surreal.Overall, costumes, choreography and art direction are to be commended, writing and direction are not.

It had me laughing so hard at times, but drawn so strongly to it's allure I could not break away, and was devastated by the tragic ending. Even though the first minute of the film tells you it will be a tragic ending, you still don't want to believe...It's difficult for me to assess this film because I cannot separate it from the emotions it evoked. Suffice to say, it left me breathless, dazzled, seduced, laughing, anxious, fearful, and broken. Truly not something anyone should miss, I recommend this film to /everyone./",Moulin Rouge!

Ive never particularly liked musicals, and was cautious of this new ""modern"" type. My expectations, visual limits, everything ,dashed. Moulin Rouge! is in cocept a simple movie, and like most musicals doesn't have much depth or extensive plot or character development. The most important thing in watching this movie is that you except it for what it is, a musical, not an emotional drama.
The most stunning aspect of Moulin Rouge is certainly the visual imagery that dazzles you at every corner, and the cinematography that brings the never ending bustle of extroardinary activity in the Moulin Rouge! nightclub in 1900 Paris to the viewers in a stylish manner.

Wow!I won't ruin it for anyone by going through the plot - La Boheme meets La Traviata and rocks!I thought the cast were superb, particularly the two leads - if Nicole Kidman doesn't get the Oscar there is definitely something wrong.Original, witty and brash - Mr Luhrmann - we salute you!9/10",Moulin Rouge!

I will give it a 5 as it did possess some amusing moments but I am beginning to think that Baz Luhrman might be a reincarnation of Ed Wood. I remember watching an awards show last fall and being shocked when this movie won for Best Original Score. This is not a movie with an original score. It might have an original song, but not much else. It is an overinflated vainglorious mess. I can imagine the director and his cohorts congratulating themselves on their artistic brilliance after every little oddity. Toulouse Latrec with a Winchester Lisp? give me a break. The movie was nothing more or less than Camille on LSD. Save us from more self-professed artistic genius movie makers.",Moulin Rouge!

832,bethgoodsell,Definitely interesting but it didn't make a big impression.,6,5 January 2003,"The biggest problem I had with this movie was that the music was not original.  I mean, with the amount of money they spent making the film they could have bought some pre-written score or something rather than just take snippets of music from say, Elton John and the Sound of Music.**Possible Spoilers** I don't have any problem with the stars - the two leads have rather nice voices actually. But the plot? I'm sorry, maybe I'm a purist but the whole prostitute thing AND consumption - not an attractive concept.So, although the music isn't original and sometimes the characters get on my nerves, see it if you want to. I mean, don't buy it unless you've seen it. I'd give it a 6/10. If you like the concept of Moulin Rouge, see Chicago (2002), it's a lot better.",Moulin Rouge!

836,ParanoiaPoliticianDiva77,Christian...get over satine and love me!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,4 February 2006,"i've had the soundtrack since it came out but being 10 wen it initially was in movies i didn't see it, finally seeing it i thought one thing-marry me Christian. this movie is a whirlwind of romance, love,longing, intrigue ,affairs, song, dance, colour and death. its amazing and has rekindled the popularity of the musical movie, i loved all the songs and fell in love with Christian's as soon as i saw his first flash back wen he sang those first notes ""THE HILLS ARE ALIVE..."". he's GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the romeo and Juliet style romance is gorgeous and her death @ the end was so sad! everyone cries, I love the way this movie can touch you with its passion and love but upset you because of the heart wrenching truths of satines 'job' yet entertain you from the twirling camera moves and bursts of colour and music and make you laugh at the sweet goofs it makes along the way. The beginning has the same style as William Shakespeare's Romeo+Julilet, like the prologue-the performance of nature boy has already told us the ending, that satine dies. the reason this hooks us and we don't just walk out of the cinema going ""hmmm whatever i no what happens"" its because we want to see HOW it happens!!!! i love how he goes on to this completely off the wall situation where ""an unconscious Argentinian fell through my roof followed by a dwarf dressed as a nun"" the appropriation of ""the sound of music"" was really clever and using Kylie for a tinkerbell-like hallucination was really cute. the whirlwind into the moulin rouge was interesting and metaphorical. The appearance of satine, sitting on this trapeze was very effective. it has a metaphorical sense saying ""even though yes, i am a hooker, i am still above you men, because i am only a hooker cause men need hookers"" it shows that no matter what, she is still above the pigs who pay for her. The most powerful scene is El Tango De Roxanne, it has so much energy and emotion that every1 is drawn to tears as Christian cries out ""I LOVE YOU"" as satine is nearly violated by the duke. The anger and jealousy of the Argentinian touches you as throughout the tango Nini is passed from man to man, all faceless men willing to pay. The Choreography of the tango-suddenly all the cancan girls and their boys joining and doing this powerful tango in their old time underwear is so touching and powerful and makes you stop and think about the lives of these people. Another of the most heart wrenching moments is when Christian, desperate to believe satines leaving him 4 something else, that she still loves him, and he screams for her outside the mouiln rouge and u see satine crying in the clouds. then he goes and tries to pay her and they stumble onto stage, satine sobbing and Christian trying 2 force money into satines hands. then as he walks off she stands up and starts singing come what may and you know even though she'll die, you still know that they will have some happy last moments. and as they sing this beautiful love song to each other with the bursts of music and colour on the stage ending in rose petals you just want to bawl your eyes out in happiness that a love like that actually exists. and as the curtain goes down, you know this is it-she's going to die now. But chirstian does what she asked him to-to tell their story and your left wth a satisfied feeling, and as the credits roll you relise your face is wet wih tears...",Moulin Rouge!

My favourite part is the 'Like a virgin' sequence, which is hilarious! But you'll have to watch the film to see it! All the actors and actresses in the film are very talented and mostly sing the songs themselves, which I think is fantastic and makes the film even better, if that is possible!

839,barrys-2,The Emperor's not-so-new clothes.,1,6 June 2001,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's too bad that the IMDB rating scale only has `1' as the lowest possible rating. `Moulin Rouge' is a textbook case for much of what is wrong with some contemporary popular films. It substitutes technical tricks for style, and frenetic cutting in place of meaningful development. The story is the epitome of triteness, creating a soap opera melange out of Camille, Orpheus, and the old Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney movies where they decide `let's put on a show.' As a deconstructive musical, it depends on send-ups of popular songs to fill out most of its excruciating two-plus hours (there is some undistinguished new material), and this is interspersed with bits and pieces imitating scenes from a wide variety of films of the past, most notably the works of The Three Stooges. The dialogue is extremely lame, often painfully mistaking popular song lyrics for great poetry, and it certainly lives down to the level of the story. The overall attitude of this film,  is that if you take the kitchen sink approach and throw in as much stuff at as fast a pace as possible, many people will be tricked into thinking that there's substance here, rather than just the frantic hyperactivity of a desperate mind with a vague notion and a lot of money to spend on bringing it to the screen. This becomes quickly apparent after the same gimmicks are used over and over even in the very beginning of the film. By the end of the film you've seen the same devices so many times that a nauseating numbing effect results. While, like a cinematic junkyard, it is truly crammed with great numbers of things (cuts, costumes, camera moves, set pieces, computer effects, etc.), there is no overriding sense of purpose or vision, just the effects of juxtapositions of elements, and this quickly creates a tedious and irritating result. Nevertheless, many will be fooled into mistaking quantity for quality, and will believe that they saw something of merit. It might also be appreciated by younger people who have been weaned on music videos. `Moulin Rogue' may be the first commercial film created expressly for the ADD crowd.",Moulin Rouge!
840,DP-7,"Not a film, an experience. But so is watching paint dry!",4,3 March 2002,"Baz Luhrmann has aimed high and attempted to produce a stunning cinematic experience that is larger than life.  Sadly he fell short.This film has a plot so shallow that were it a puddle, ants could wade through it. Some films succeed despite this, but Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! is so crammed with over-exuberance that you can't help feeling that he was aware of the weakness of the plot and was trying to distract viewers from it. A good script has often overcome poor plots, but almost half the script (it irritatingly seems like more) is lifted directly from the lyrics of various songs. What begins as mildly amusing with 'The Sound of Music' rapidly wears thin as you realise that there was very little originality or creativity put in to the script. Then it becomes downright annoying that Luhrmann and Pierce have claimed writing credit for outright plagiarism of the works of many artists. Proponents of the film have pointed out to me that this isn't the point, that the whole extravanganza outweighs these shortcomings. Certainly the many song and dance routines, complete with their eclectic and impressive staging and costumes, lift the film up, but much of the great choreography is ruined by some unfortunately heavy and jarring editing that consistantly detracts from some good performances. The cast does perform well (if you like the singing performances of the actors), but the roles do not settle down well, with the tone bouncing from romantic through to farce via many other genres. This does not seem to be the fault of the cast, rather from a directorial approach that failed to decide what it wanted. The end result of this to-ing and fro-ing is that I felt no emotional contact with the characters even by the latter stages of the film and was actually thankful when Satine died as it meant that we must be near the end!That said, this film does have its good points. The visuals are stunning; the costumes and sets are divine (if you like over the top); there are many 'small touches' that are worth looking out for; and the soundtrack is an inspired collection of predominantly old pop and rock classics, but with a number of newer or new tracks as well - all are good. The concept is bold, even if the execution has produced a 'cinematic experience' that is ultimately tedious and gives the impression that the film's good points are purposely outlandish to stun you in to missing its shortcomings.Is it worth seeing? Yes - I am glad that I saw it (even more glad when the final credits came up!). Is it worth buying? Only of you are undemanding of anything more than bright colours and good music in your taste of film or else it will wear thin very rapidly. Expect to see many copies of the DVD appear on the second hand market in due course.",Moulin Rouge!

This is about style and no substance. This is about showering us with visuals and edits to hide, well, the sorry-ass state of the film. This is about schlock comedy bits that are too lame to be used in a 'Friends' skit. This is about having a villain so cliched and lame and obvious and cartoonish, a satire of his character in the movie would have absolutely nothing to expound upon.

Spectacular! film, is not entertained by it.  Even if a movie-goer hated Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"", I fail to see how the film could be unentertaining for them...Bombast is a quality too often unseen in modern American filmmaking. Aside from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", there was not a film released in 2000 that was as imaginative and daring as ""Moulin Rouge"".  The film, quite literally, is a visceral and aural feast, and with scenes like Satine's (Nicole Kidman) swingset descent from the rafters of the Moulin Rouge reminded me of being in the theater for ""Phantom of the Opera"" and seeing the chandelier fall. And while some critics decry that the film uses too many modern pop songs that seem inappropriate in a late 19th/early 20th century setting, I think the songs give the film a universal appeal rather than having it seem artsy-fartsy.  Besides, music artists have sampled for years now and people praise it, so why knock Luhrmann for ""sampling"" pop songs in his musical.I hope that lots of people go and see ""Moulin Rouge.""  It is delightful and sumptuous, brazen and exhilirating, bold and creative.  This return to the movie musical wears its heart on its sleeve and is not ashamed to see it. Movie audiences- (parents, take your children) see this film over souless corporate shill like ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Mummy Returns"" and ""Shrek"" (I don't care how cute or clever people say this film is- it is designed simply to sell dolls and Happy Meals).

I went to complain to the manager that the movie was out of focus but he said the first reel was suppose to be and he had a letter from the film company to prove it. For me, it was too surreal and gave me a headache. But after that ridiculous scene where the actors offer a preview of ""Spectacular Spectacular"" for the Duke, it got so much better! What surprised me the most was Ewan and Nicole's voices...I had heard they weren't very good but they blew me out of my seat. They gave 100% which is so risky in a project like this. They both had so much confidence and sincerity on screen and without it, this movie would have descended into complete camp. They sang their hearts out. I liked Ewan from Trainspotting but he completely won my heart in this picture...he was so earnestly in love you could almost feel his joy and pain. And Nicole! I knew she could be a sexpot when she wants to but she almost pulls a Marilyn Monroe in this...sexy & talented but with an added gift of intelligence and street smarts.All I can say is that this is one film where part of the audience walks out and another part is sobbing at the end!

This was worth all the exposure to lesser films this year. I am really amazed that I am going so overboard in my praise because it really is not my nature.  The last time I was even nearly so impressed was the drama of ""Boys don't Cry"".   This, of course, is very different moviemaking.

849,glumpy_99,"A great visual achievement, missing a truly moving tragedy",7,7 December 2001,"***MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS***Having just seen 'MOULIN ROUGE' for the fifth time, I am ready to deliver my verdict on this visually challenging, but somewhat emotionally distant film. It's chief asset, and it is a wonderful asset, is director Baz Luhrmann's original and imaginative view of Paris, circa 1900. The film is a how-to exercise in making big, grand entertainment and making it entertaining rather than resulting in an exercise of self-congratulation. I enjoyed the way that, visually, everything was brazenly overdone, down to the decision to film all scenes, particularly the dance scenes, in gaudy reds and yellows.Performances, save one, were particularly well done in a film that must have been difficult to perform in. Nicole Kidman delivers another superb performance, proving that she is also a very adept singer. Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxbrugh are also very fine in roles which they seem to have been instructed to not hold back; I particularly enjoyed Roxbrugh's immensley entertaining villian, who reminded me of the man in the pantomimes in the black hat who grins wickedly at the audience, and Roxbrugh embodies this persona wonderfully. The one performance that just doesn't reach the same level of excellence of the rest of the cast is that of leading man Ewan McGregor. His singing voice, particularly in the scenes where he must hit, or struggle to hit, the high notes of 'THE SOUND OF MUSIC,' grew increasingly tiresome and irritating for me, (I have spoken to other people who have said that McGregor's voice was acceptable, so it must be a matter of personal choice.) I also found his constant reliance on looks from his puppy-dog eyes to be somewhat nauseating.Luhrmann has said that, with his movie, he wanted to present a view of the Moulin Rouge that would be shocking/exciting to contemporary audiences. This results in the usage of music that is some seventy to eighty years out of its time. I don't know where Luhrmann found the inspiration to have Kidman sing 'DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND' as an opening cabaret number, or to stage Madonna's 'LIKE A VIRGIN' using Richard Roxbrugh and Jim Broadbent careening around on a bed on wheels, or to stage the Police hit 'ROXANNE' as a tango dance led by Jacek Koman, but these scenes create moments of true movie magic and stand out in my mind as some of the great moments in modern cinema.The one final fault with this film lays with its love story. The love story didn't work for me because it involved laying heavy human emotion on two characters who had insofar been established as caricatures. I think back to Luhrmann's own 'STRICTLY BALLROOM' (1993) which treated the love story between its two caricatures as secondary to visuals and therefore succeeded. I must confess to feeling very restless during the final curtain-call scene. I stared at the screen and wondered whether I was supposed to care about a character who wasn't even human. The tragedy would have worked far better for me had it been a more metaphoric one, to fit with the mood of the preceding two hours.It is still one of the greatest looking films I have ever seen and the music and set design are first-class, as you will see from my 'out of 10' rating. However it misses its potential to be a great film because of Luhrmann's inability to decide which way he wants it; all style or all substance or, (and this would have been the mark of a great film) a bit of both. 9 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!

855,JosephChillingworth,Different,7,4 July 2002,"I enjoy experimental filmmaking, so this caught my attention when a friend showed it to me.  Having seen a can-can performance at the REAL Moulin Rouge, I can honestly say that this film does not do it justice.  For any fans of this movie, I suggest seeing the real thing, then your regard for this film might falter.But back to the film . . .Visually it's eye-candy.  It does a nice job of representing the world as a stage, but it looks too much like an MTV music video.  Please note that this does NOT hurt the film - it simply makes it difficult to watch - like watching the epilepsy enducing visuals of Pokemon.  Just be warned.The songs are fun - that's what I really enjoyed about this film.  What better way to update the movie musical than by using POPULAR songs?  And the way the film incorporates the songs really works.  It's humorous and uplifting to hear them in the context of the story.  (The Beatles' ""All You Need is Love."" is a subtle, yet strong example.)Ah, but now I reach the story . . .GAG!  PUKE!  WTF!!!!!  *cough* *cough* Excuse me . . . Okay, I'm better now. :)Disney seriously comes up with more original and complex storylines than this (Bambi, The Lion King, etc).  But lest I forget the dialogue! Whoo-boy!  CLICHE is the word of the day!
Anyhoo, like Batman, this film is all about the visuals (and the music) so it's best to watch it looking and listening for those things.  Just cover your ears when they're not singing, folks.  :)  Otherwise, do yourself a favor and turn off the television, leave the movie theatre, and take your next vacation to Paris to feast your eyes on the one and only Moulin Rouge!P.S. For a better modern musical, check out Dancer in the Dark.  It's definately MORE experimental and MORE creative in its experimentation than Moulin Rouge.  And guess what?  The dialogue's intelligent.",Moulin Rouge!
856,BigYellowBiohazard,The stuff of true & brilliant cinema!,10,14 April 2002,"This is no movie. Moulin Rouge is an intoxicating, life-affirming, magical audio-visual experience. It's something which you'll likely never come across again, and if you aren't touched in some way by it, then you can't be human. Everything: the acting, the script, the cinematography, the music, the amount of wisdom and soul injected into it strikes chords with me that no other film has ever done (though ""Almost Famous"" isn't far off). It is a simply wondrous work of art. One of the things that most surprised me was the fact (stop the presses!) that Ewan McGregor - bless his soul - can sing! And not just an average singing voice: a real, powerful, Broadway-esque voice that goes perfectly with Nicole Kidman's (which is also excellent). This blend of vocal quality and evident chemistry between them is the pivot on which movie spins. The story is as deep and sumptuous as the music, giving Ewan & Nicole's Christian & Satine exactly the kind of canvas on which to weave their magic. On face value, Moulin Rouge is much more style than substance, and granted it is VERY colourful and visually spectacular - but the basis of the story is very emotional. The idea of these two completely different people - one a struggling & penniless writer, the other an out-of-this-world underworld performer - is so well carried off that I couldn't help feeling a sense of reality to it. It seemed to me that they were real, and they were really in love. The kind of movie that breaks your heart (and you don't care, because it is so fantastic) and takes your breath away EVERY time you watch it, is one to be treasured. There really aren't enough words in the world to describe the sheer incredibility of a film that I for one am proud to say ""Moulin Rouge is my all-time ultimate top-of-the-class favourite film ever, and I don't care who knows it"" about. The performances, the score, the screenplay, the artistry - every one of Moulin Rouge's attributes is unique, and will probably never be equaled, let alone surpassed. It's a wonderful experience and one that I will love having over and over again.",Moulin Rouge!
857,dwbball50,The Acting is great but the movie drags on forever!,8,16 August 2001,"Moulin Rouge is quite and intriguing new style of film making that caught my eye from the start of the movie.  Nearly a thousand different frames fly by your eyes in the beginning of the movie moving from one picture to the next. If you are not alert while watching this movie, you will be visually dazed. The story line is nothing out of the ordinary.  Two lovers battle over the same girl and you can pretty much predict the ending except with a little twist.Many people walked out of the theater crying but the movie didn't seem to hit me that much.  The visual effects are interesting but the movie seems to bounce around way to much.  I found myself rubbing my eyes trying to focus on what was going on but it was hard.  The first half of Moulin Rouge is the best part of the movie in my opinion.  It is gracefully funny and entertaining.  The second half moves along extremely slow for over an hour going back and forth about how much each person loves the girl.  It made me sick and wanting to run out of the theater.  I thought the ending was never going to come.The acting was superb!  Nicole Kidman as Satine does a fantastic acting job throughout the film.  I wouldn't be shocked to see her nominated and winning a best actress award when the oscars come around.  Ewan McGregor also does a great job acting.  Though a singing voice is patched in over his because after this movie is a musical.Overall, I was entertained for the first half of the movie but then the love story took over and I started to slide down my chair.  The movie moves really fast and at times is quite tedious.  If you like love stories and like movies where you cry (girls), you will like this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
858,norwood34,All Style and No Substance,1,25 July 2002,"Moulin Rouge is all style and no substance.  There is certainly a lot to look at and a lot to listen to, but you won't care.  This is a long and boring movie.  The characters are one-dimensional.  You won't care what happens to them.  The story is silly and predictable.  You will know the ending very soon.  The direction is horrible.  The camera keeps jumping all over the place too fast.  Moulin Rouge is like an extremely long music video.",Moulin Rouge!
859,bogiefan-2,Two thumbs across,2,10 June 2001,"I can't trash this film because I didn't see the whole thing - having left with a friend who insisted on walking out about 1/2way through. I would have otherwise toughed it out but, after a full hour, was nowhere close to being engaged by this work.I can't say the acting was bad because I honestly didn't see any acting and any that was there would have been lost through the distractions of rapid zoom shots and numerous (way-too-close) close-ups. It sure had style - but we've seen (and heard) it all before on MTV. And although Kidman and McGregor were surprisingly good singers, the song productions were just too disjointed, unoriginal, over the top and unfunny for me.
Okay, I'll admit that I'm not a big fan of musicals and prefer plot lines and character development to glitz and an omnipresent soundtrack.  My apologies to those who truly loved this film (for its whimsy I'm guessing?) but I just couldn't find anything to like.Recommended for those who like musicals, fast-paced editing, lush sets or who are just curious to see Kidman and McGregor sing old Elton John songs over and over.Can't give this one a thumbs up or down.",Moulin Rouge!
860,drplw,In the top 100 films ever created. Period.,10,21 January 2002,"I saw it 4 times in theatres and couldn't get enough of it.  There is magic in the film, the music, characters and production.  It is simply a phantasmogoria of delight, innovative, romantic, haunting, and O so wonderfully tragic.  I was in love with all the characters simultaneously - a very rare occurance.Baz Luhrmann is simply a genius of geniuses.  His vision, new ideas, and depth of discovery is awesome.  I purchased the DVD to give to a friend for Christmas.  Watched it on a large screen and still weep and joy for Christian, what a great character.  I sure wish Ewan had won best actor in a musical or comedy at Golden Globes.  At least he was honored but it would have been so uplifting had he also won.  As it was, Nicole was honored, rightfully so and so was the film - best in its category.I deeply hope that Oscar recognizes the greatness of Moulin Rouge.  It deserves to be re-released so that those who missed this masterpiece, will have the opportunity of seeing it for the first time.  Moreover, I affirm here and now that Moulin Rouge will be nominated in all the following categories: Best film, Best director, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best supporting actor, Best screenplay, best art direction, best musical score, best song in a motion picture, best costume design.It deserves this kind of recognition.  For those naysayers who didn't get the film, for those who said it was over the top, don't believe them.  If you haven't seen Moulin Rouge, you missed out on a fantastic masterwork of cinema.  Just go buy it, rent it, or watch it at a friend's house.  It is the best darm film of 2001.",Moulin Rouge!
861,tatlicupcake,lush,10,25 March 2007,"A luxurious movie. The beginning of the movie is hysterical, weird, sexy and it gracefully transcends into true love and drama. Throughout the film, there is the apparent theme of beauty - the scenes and sets are lush and luxurious, the leading actor and actress are handsome and beautiful as opposed to the ""circus freaks"" who populated Moulin Rouge, the music is made up of remixed songs but it captivates you to a world of fantasy and love. The acting is superb as the sensual Nicole Kidman (satine)allures you into loving her. She plays a strong character who eventually gives into love. Ewan McGregor (Christian) voice will make you fall in love with him. He plays a romantic character whose gentle passion turns to strong fierce raging love. There is tenderness through his voice and eyes which will make every woman sigh longing for a man just as romantic as he is. He truly deserved the Golden Globe. John Leguizamo is just excellent - comedic and sweet. He gave his legs for this performance and should be recognized for it. Jim Broadbent is perfect - he plays a father like figure to Satine who believes her love affair with Christian is nothing until he discovers that they truly love each other. Richard Roxburgh plays a static character so it's not a difficult character to play but Richard pulls it off wonderfully. This movie will break your heart and make you sing and make you laugh. It makes you want to fall in love.",Moulin Rouge!
862,bean_invaders,"Awful, painful, migraine-inducing sparkly vomit (*SPOILERS*)",2,24 March 2002,"I didn't want to see this movie.  I'll just come right out and say that up front.  From the very first preview I was turned off by all the singing and dancing and glitter.  I was incredibly bored one day, however, and a friend who really loved it insisted that I would, as well.  I didn't think so, but I decided to be open-minded.I was ill-prepared for the next torturous four hours (or however long it actually was; it certainly seemed like four hours or so) that I was subjected to.This film is so shallow as to be less than one-dimensional, if that's possible.  Everyone was so busy showing off that there was no time for any character development.  It was impossible to care about any of them.  The tale itself was trite, rehashed old crud served up in a glittery package.  Oh, but wait!  They're singing awful pop songs from the '70's and '80's that everyone hates!  How terribly clever and original!Oddly enough, for a movie that moved so fast and had so much going on at once that I literally got a migraine after watching it, it certainly dragged on and on.  By the time I finally made it to the end, I just couldn't wait for the main character to DIE ALREADY so that this nightmare would end, but she had to cough for about 6 years and look beautiful first.This film's broad appeal truly causes me to fear for our society as a whole.  The only two kinds of people that I could see enjoying this film would be either people with severe ADD or fans of Elton John.  Or perhaps a frightening combination of the two.  I guess there are more of these people around than I thought.If you have a soul and want to keep it, avoid this horrible, horrible movie.",Moulin Rouge!

Planet of the Apes?  NO!!  There you have it.  All the blockbusters have failed and not lived up to expectations.  The others films I 'd rate as good are Shrek, Atlantis, Spy Kids, and Dr. Doolittle 2.  But Moulin Rouge was AWESOMELY fun and entertaining.Hands down, this movie is the movie with the MOST.  Comedy, drama, music, dancing, intrigue, suspense, and love.  What more??  There's Passion, Love, Freedom, oh wow!!  This is sure to be a RENTAL classic.  I mean, it really doesn't get any better than this.Ewan can SInG.  Yes he can.  He's handsome, cute, funny, and irresistable. Nicole Kidman is a perfect partner for him.  The Can Can dancing is so fun and enjoyable that I watched this movie over 10 times.  The acting is so good that I laughed, cried, and sang with every viewing.The story is not fantastic or earthshattering but it is 10 times better than many of the stuff Hollywood puts into the market.  This was 50% Hollywood and 50% artistic/literary film.  I cannot hold my enthusiasm for this movie as it totally took my emotions and soul for a wonderful ride.",Moulin Rouge!

I only wanted to see it knowing and loving the previous movie, Shakespeare in Love. Ad I went to see it in the first day of the premiere.. It made me laugh, wonder, cry, be sad and happy all at the same time. I never understood why some of the viewers left the cinema hall before the end of the movie. I loved the actors and felt every bit of the story. I cried and I would cry again If i saw it. Oh, I can bet that I will see it again. But take a girl's advice and DON'T GO ALONE to see this movie.

It really gave me confidence that cinema can still produce wonderful movies. Moulin Rouge is such a wonderful experience to watch. Everything, from the beautiful sets, bizar cinematography excellent soundtrack and wonderful acting is flawless. It's such an amazing achievement. The story itself, centering on the love-affair between Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor may be old, it may be unoriginal, but it's told in such an entertaining way that it never becomes irritating or dull. And credit for this achievement should be given especially to the main characters, Nicole and Ewan. They really shine in this picture, not only acting extremely well, but also singing extremely well. They've succeeded in making the story seem fresh and original simply by acting so well.And then I have to say that this movie is the first one wich in my eyes really deserves an oscarsweep this year, or at least get a lot of nominations(male & female performance, art-direction, cinematography, costumes). This movie contains everything that makes cinema great, makes you laugh, cry, and brings you in a state of awe that won't leave you quickly.

Many familiar songs, but we have CD players at home.  We need not go to a movie theatre to hear the songs.

The screenplay is excellent, so is the directing. The cast couldn't been better. I think that you really feel Ewan in this one. Nicole is brilliant as Satin, she really captures her 'spirit'. Also, I have to comment on the soundtrack. Absolutely one of the best ever heard. Especially if you're in a difficult relationship yourself and if you're experiencing strong emotion towards someone you're not supposed to , it will surely bring a tear in your eye. The part: ''you're free to leave me, but just don't deceive me and please, believe me when I say I love you'' does the trick for me. The movie really touched me in two parts. The 'Roxanne' one, of course and the 'The show must go on'. I cry every time I see them.

It made me want to dance in my seat. Interesting renderings of some very familiar popular tunes. Ewan McGregor was adorable in this film. Nicole Kidman was beautiful as always. If you like dancing and singing and eye candy, you'll love this.
One caution: if you don't like those old Hollywood musicals where the plot is just basically an excuse for a lot of singing and dancing to occur, and wouldn't like them with updated music, either, then don't see it. I happen to love those movies and wish they were made more often these days. I'd compare it to ""Hair"" or ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" for being a fun musical with modern music.",Moulin Rouge!
872,heybrakywacky,"A first-rate movie musical, after all this time!",8,8 July 2001,"First of all, this is a movie musical.  So if you really don't like musicals, this movie may not be for you.That said, I love musicals, and once I realized that direction in the movie (I did not know it was a musical beforehand), I settled into musical mode and continued.  The fact that this is a musical also explains many critics' disdain for the seemingly cloying and simplistic plot.  Musicals are not generally known for their complex intellectual themes.  They're not supposed to be.  Musicals are supposed to evoke more of an emotional response, and in my opinion, this one does an outstanding job.  The bohemian theme of love above all else...what more could you ask for in a depiction of turn of the century Montmartre in Paris?  I kept expecting Edith Piaf's voice to come through, wrenching my heart right out.Moulin Rouge is fast-paced, with a continual barrage of sensory stimuli.  I know that is a sore point for many critics.  I love it.  It gives me that much more reason to see it again, to see what I've missed.  And there is indeed so much to see.  The cinematography is amazing!  The costumes are not far behind.  But above all else, on an emotional level, this musical delivers.  There are only a few moments in the entire movie that I think are a bit overdone.  But they are gone in a flash, replaced with suspense, humor, or any number of whirlwind emotions as the cast jumps into another performance.My advice is if you see this movie, go in with an open mind.  Prepare for elaborate musical productions.  Prepare to be sensorially assaulted.  Let la vie bohème wash over you.

But Satin wants to become a famous actress and if she wants to achieve this she has to be with the Duke,the man who produces the theatrical play in which she will star.So Satin will have to make a choice either to follow her dream and become a well known actress or let herself enjoy her romance with Christian.The movie is a fantastic dramatic musical directed by the visionary director Baz Lurhman.The cast is magnificent too, Nicole Kidman dazzles as Satin and her co-star Ewan McGregor is very charming (They both do their own singing in the movie). Let Moulin Rouge take you to another world, where you will be amazed by the set,the costumes,the bohemian world of Toulouse Lautrec(played by Jonh Leguizamo) and the music composed by Armstrong.

881,mikespoff,A spellbinding experience of Shakespearean proportions,10,25 February 2002,"Spectacular, spectacular... the title of a dance hall show in the film, and the most apt description of the film itself.  It is a show of enormous vision and brilliance - truly an Experience.Following up his entrancingly surreal version of ""Romeo and Juliet"", director Baz Luhrmann has created his own spectacle of Shakespearean proportions.  Like all of the master playwright's greatest works, the story is superficially simple - the plot could be summarised in one paragraph - and yet the message is deceptively complex.  The themes of truth, beauty, freedom and love wash over you in a spellbinding display of style, and you are transported into the Bohemian world without even realising it.The story is set in and around a dance hall in Paris, and so, fittingly, much of the story is told through song and dance.  The music is a glorious montage of styles, featuring songs by David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, Sting, Fatboy Slim, Nirvana, Elton John and old Marilyn Monroe numbers all flowing seamlessly together.  With vocal cameos by Placido Domingo and Ozzy Osbourne - need I say more?There simply are no weak points.  The performances from all the actors are impeccable, and the cinematography and visual effects will blow you away even if you are immune to the power of the music.  After watching it six times in the cinema, I was still captivated by it.I'll have to stop now - I'm in danger of running out of superlatives, and anyway, the movie speaks for itself far better than a review ever could. Simply put it is a magical and beautiful production, the likes of which you have never seen before.See it.  Fall in love with it.  Be forever changed.

All my friends told me how incerdable it was, however, after having watched it, the only reason they or anyone liked it that I can think of is that they're astounded by colors. Plain and simple, the movie is a jumbled mess of colors swirling around the screen while beautiful music plays in the background. None of the acting is in the least bit redeeming, and sometimes downright embarrassing, the cinematography is often too dizzying to watch, and there is not a single unpredictable plot twist or intended laugh. My friends all cried at the end I was practically shouting that we knew it was going to happen for the past three hours for in the opening scene, we are informed that the woman Christian loved is dead.

However, the trailers had enticed me and so, I sat down to watch now one of my favourite all time films. 'Moulin Rouge' is a fantastic love story, musically enhanced and set in the early 1900s. Nicole Kidman did a wonderful job portraying Satine, and Ewan McGregor's voice is absolutely fantastic. I rewatched the movie just to hear him sing again. I admit however that some scenes where a little bit, um, unusual. For example, when Satine is trying to seduce Christian (whom at the time she thinks is the Duke ), I was a little bit thrown off. You can't help but groaning, ""Nicole! How could you?"" However, you do have to remember that Satine was a prostitute. All in all, I'd say that 'Moulin Rouge' is an excellant film with fantastic musical numbers ('Come What May' and 'Roxanne'). But then again, I can't guarantee that you are going to enjoy this movie.

Plot? Who needs it, it's a movie about love! Who cares if we know the ending after the first 5 minutes? Acting? What's that? Only Kidman and the guy who played the Duke were good with Ewan McGregor being totally pathetic (not that the script helped him one bit but still).

886,eyetothescreen,It could have been a love story,4,14 September 2002,"Note:  This commentary contains spoilers for ""Moulin Rouge"".""Moulin Rouge"" is one of those films that one is not certain how to rate. While it is clever in concept and visually rich, the plot lacks substance, relying on a sugar-coated set of ""true bohemian"" tenants to tell what is essentially a hackneyed boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl story.  It's also historically annoying, lousing up with its portrayal of the privileged fin-de-siecle artist Toulouse-Lautrec as a starving writer/performer, but succeeding with a number of coy David Bowie references.Yet its most frustrating aspect is its inability or refusal to create audience sympathy for Satine (played by Nicole Kidman), the actress-prostitute who abandons her credo of love for money only to have a fling with the poor poet Christian (played by Ewan McGregor).  Certainly she is pretty, certainly she is sexy, but when she gives up all for love during a song montage, the audience doesn't yet have a real reason to care about her-we simply haven't had enough time alone with her away from the lights and color.  Ewan McGregor is more successful as her lover, but he acted a much finer love affair with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in ""Velvet Goldmine"". Indeed, ""Velvet Goldmine"" is a good picture to measure ""Moulin Rouge"" against, since it too tells a splashy, sexy rock-and-roll love story, but manages to do it with sure style and real sentiment, things ""Moulin Rouge"" only grasps after.",Moulin Rouge!

They even both have references to drinking absinthe and seeing the green fairy.The characters are flat and everything is pretty darn predictable, but that's OK. It's a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously.",Moulin Rouge!
888,IMarriedBritneySpears,"Freedom, Beauty, Truth, and Love",10,24 January 2003,"I too often find people trying to take this movie for something it's not, or criticizing something that's not even there. For example, saying that it ripped off songs when that wasn't why they were used at all. I don't understand how people could possibly be so lacking in common sense. Personally this is my favorite movie. I am not claiming to know all about cinema, I am not claiming it is the greatest movie of all time, simply that I enjoy it very much. I saw it in the theater when it first came out, and I instantly had my breath taken away, and though some of the pacing was fast, I very much wanted to try to keep up and was absolutely in love with the film. I saw it five times in the theater, and I've since watched it quite a few times on DVD. Moulin Rouge is the story of Christian and Satine, a penniless writer and a courtesan. They fall in love in nineteenth century Paris. It was pieced together with many great songs from the twentieth century. This movie was in no way trying to make a new and exciting story, simply trying to tell the story in a new, different, and exciting way, for which I think it did triumphantly. I very highly recommend it, though I know several people who have turned it off because they thought it was moving too fast (I also noticed some people leave the theater), and some others who didn't like the love story because apparently they... don't like and want to admit they have emotions? *coughmyexboyfriendcough* I find this film very moving. Some people I know call it a ""chick flick"", then giggle and twirl their hair around their finger. Stupid peers.",Moulin Rouge!

This is a waste of celluloid being a musical lover myself this is the worst movie that the genre has ever seen , an awful script , filled with horrible old pop songs everybody forget and they should of stayed forgotten! and a terrible performance by the over rated Nicole kidman make for a crap film , And people have the nerve to compare this to actual good films like Chicago!

891,volpone13,A Bohemian Feast for the Senses,9,24 November 2003,"I honestly didn't expect to like ""Moulin Rouge"".  What?  Take a bunch of songs made popular by Madonna, Elton John, David Bowie, Sting, and Nat King Cole, and tie them up in a music video-style format?  You've got to be kidding?Nope.I grew up during the era when ""classic"" musicals were still the big thing... ""The Sound of Music"", ""The King and I"", ""The Music Man""... you know the type.  Grand.  Beautiful.  Safe.Baz Luhrman has managed to re-define what makes a musical.  Using every trick in the modern cinematic arsenal, he's created something as grand and beautiful, but never ""safe"".I didn't like it.  I loved it.  But then I love theatre.  And this is as theatrical as you can get.  It's big, brash, larger than life in every aspect, and it MOVES!  There's enough energy in this production to power Sydney for a fortnight.I can't begin to talk about the actors... everyone turns in a stellar performance.  I already liked Kidman, McGregor, and Leguizamo from previous works, but Jim Broadbent as Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge, and Richard Roxburgh as the delightfully dislikable Duke fit right in and made themselves right at home among my favorite performances.  And watching the two of them sing ""Like a Virgin"" in a Busby Berkeley styled comedy number with a dozen waiters flitting around like a bunch of demented fruit-flies was hysterically funny.  When just thinking back on the jokes still makes you laugh, that's good comedy.Basically, the movie was nothing like what I expected... but then, it's not really like anything else, so how could I expect it?  But I still liked it... a lot.I doubt ""Moulin Rouge"" is for everybody, but then again neither is champagne.  Me... I like the bubbles.Simply great movie.",Moulin Rouge!
892,reserved_for_unwanted_messages,A remarkable experience,10,18 June 2005,"Moulin Rouge is the most visually unique thing I've seen since I don't know when. I watch an awful lot of movies, and I pay attention to things like color and camera work. A lot of people don't. In Moulin Rouge, you can't help it. These aspects grab you by the collar and shake you around for 2 hours. From the bright, vibrant, almost neon nighttime colors when the Bohemian ideals (love, truth, beauty) of Montmarte are celebrated, to the brownish, daytime hues when harsher realities set in, this movie sustains our attention. The images run the range from beautiful (Satine, bathed in blue light) to garish (the owner's appearance, and his tendency to shout loudly and closely in people's faces) to bleak (the entire setting when the plot grows more grim).I am not even a fan of musicals per se. There have been occasional musicals that I have enjoyed, but I am not one to sit down and relish the choreographed movements of the Sharks and Jets. Yet if any non-musical lover has a chance of crossing over, this is it. Moulin Rouge is a musical on speed, a post-modern musical for the new millennium. If anyone can remain unaffected by the Roxanne ""number"" near the end, I would confess astonishment. Its sheer power and fast-paced rhythm carries us along. It's one of the most incredible examples of virtuoso editing I can think of.The movie is thoroughly saturated with song. When no music is being sung, it becomes part of the dialog. Someone should count how many different songs are sung or partially quoted. From Elton John to Rogers and Hammerstein, the movie is a like a collage of music.It ends as quietly as its middle was loud. When the credits began to roll, the movie theater was silent. No one talked or made much noise; it was a response approaching reverence or at least respect.Perhaps Kenneth Turan of the L.A. Times said it best. His comment takes into account that Moulin Rouge may have its detractors. But it underscores the film's uniqueness, its coherence as something entirely different: ""You can go with it or resist it, be exhilarated or worn out. But forgetting the experience is not one of your options.""",Moulin Rouge!
893,Box_o_Chocolates,I laughed when this got nominated for an Oscar.,1,10 July 2004,"I will apologize in advance to those who liked the movie. WHY? Was it the dazzling effects? (perhaps the only thing interesting) The singing? (which nearly killed me) The acting? (definitely NO ONE'S best acting) The story? (God, no...) I even feel bad for writing a review! I could NOT get past the first hour, and I've tried, oh yes, I've tried. Twice, maybe three times. This is a sad excuse for a movie. Did it win any awards? I'm not sure, but it's quite possible it did. Now, let me think...is there anything remotely interesting? The wacky-ness was horrible. And believe me, I like silly stuff! (when appropriate) But Moulin Rouge, oy, even the title makes me cringe. This is perhaps my least favorite movie of all time. Now, call me crazy, but I like good movies, like Lord of the Rings, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and It's A Wonderful Life, just to name a few. There's PLENTY of good movies out there. Classics.Yes, I laughed when this AWFUL movie was nominated. And I rejoiced when Lord of the Rings kicked its silliness :) What a triumph!",Moulin Rouge!
894,snailgirl4,What the heck was that?,1,8 July 2006,"I read many of the comments here before renting it. I'd heard from several people it was their favorite movie, and though I was too young to see it at the time, remember what a huge deal it was when it first came out, as well as being nominated for many awards. I was surprised to read these comments that said it was like an 'acid trip.' I figured they just didn't understand originality. But they were right!! It reminded me of when I have high fevers and hallucinate! It made literally no sense until the end. It wasn't that the plot line was bad, it was that it was intertwined by such weird and almost disturbing scenes and dizzying camera angles that you were just like 'what?!?' How could this be anyone's favorite movie? It just is so...dream like...weird unconnected things thrown together. Attempts at humor (the narcoleptic Argentinian) fall totally flat because humor doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie, and serious scenes elicited huge laughs from me and my friend because they were so...odd and ridiculous. Don't see this movie. And I don't think I'm being too harsh.",Moulin Rouge!
895,AvdW,laughable,2,18 December 2004,"First off, I am no fan of musicals, but this was garbage. Why take two fine actors and have them sing? Would anybody have watched this if Kidman and McGregor weren't in it? The story was probably barfed up on a Sunday afternoon. Was there one original thought or score in the whole thing? Why take a nice little song by Elton John and have it proclaimed dully by Ewan McGregor and Richard Roxburgh? I choked on my drink when the guy kept shouting 'Roxanne!' like he had lost his dog. Too many questions (but too small to care). Hey Lady! you're coughing up blood; I'd ask the doctor about that. Hey Christian! can't you wait until the show is over? People have paid good money to see it. Hey Zidler! The little ho is dying; not too smart to put on a show with her leading, now is it? As long as we're borrowing: why not take out your light saber to prevent her from going to the dark side? This one is on my blacklist.",Moulin Rouge!

The songs are incredible, and nobody could sing them better than Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor.Nicole Kidman is absolutely amazing in this movie She and Ewen McGreggor create the kind of lovers that have not been seen since...well..ever. They have a kind of chemistry that is one-in-a-million. I absolutely love the story. I cannot believe that it hasn't gotten the kind of attention it deserves. Whoever wrote the storyline for this movie is a genius. I have never cried so hard in my entire life. Or laughed so hard either. Richard Roxburgh is excellent as the duke. He and Jim Broadbent are hilarious when they sing 'Like A Virgin'. This movie is incredible, and I've seen it thirty times. It never gets old. I laugh just as hard, I cry just as hard, and I love it just as much as I did when I saw it for the very first time.",Moulin Rouge!
897,alexanderasam,Truly a beautiful film,9,6 February 2017,"It was brilliant. When it first started, my first reaction was, this wasn't going to work, and then it opened up and just lit up the screen. The two leads were pitch perfect (who knew Nicole could sing). The imaginative director Baz Lurhmann is just fabulous. Creative, smart, and beautifully shot, not many films surprise or please me like this one did.Very few movies succeed as musicals. (CHICAGO was a masterpiece) The love story was sincere, and the chemistry between the actors was genuine. Baz directed an earlier film that I had enjoyed STRICTLY BALLROOM, which was a wonderful film and my first introduction to his works) but this one far surpassed any of his works. And so far, he hasn't topped this film. But he's diverse - and I look forward to more films directed by him. 'Romeo and Julie' was well done, but 'Great Gatsby,' though beautifully shot and directed, just was missing a 'heart' and 'Australia' though again, another well made film just feel kind of flat. Bravo to a terrific director.",Moulin Rouge!

Ewan too stands out but not as much as Nicole. I must admit I never knew that either of them could sing.The choreography to every dance was great. The dance that stands out for me is the Can Can.Overall this is an Excellent film with the actors, sets, dances and music all working Superbly. Buy or rent this film.

The editing is mediocre at best and vertigo-inducing already some 20 minutes into the film. The soundtrack just plain sucks without any slightest reference to the period and you'd think they couldn't have done worse without putting all that pop trash into this garbage movie. Dirt-cheap after effects grade post-processing effects abound (like the super cheesy and tasteless glister in the eyes). On top of it all the photography is simply not interesting and all the scenes are plain boringly lit, which is a massive blunder for a film that tries to ""dazzle"" your senses.

Late 19th century France?  Decadence? Consumption a la ""La Boheme""? Dizzying photography in the name of creativity? What were the producers of this disaster thinking?

901,debbie-26,Definitely a low in moviemaking,1,11 June 2001,"This movie ranks with the worst movies ever made.  Frenetic movement, disjointed camera angles, song snippets, and goofy sets do not make a great movie.  I'm not surprised that the MTV generation finds this compelling. It reminded me of nothing so much as the old Monkees' Saturday Morning TV show--except that the plot of Camille was thrown in and the action was speeded up.  You could say, the Monkees on acid would be a fair description.The slapstick comedy was boring, the acting abysmal, the plot made no sense, the sets looked like a second rate Disney animated film.  Let's see, take a compilation album commercial for pop love songs, add a Laurel & Hardy Film, a high school production of Camille, the Blair Witch cameraman, ""It's a small world"" Disney Theme Park Ride, throw it in a blender, crank up the speed and add some acid.  Then you would have the Moulin Rouge!",Moulin Rouge!

The opening 40 minutes not only had my head spinning, but several times during the remainder of the film I had to stop up my ears, the pain was so great! Please Baz, give us something we can see, not something flashing by so fast that we have to guess at what we saw. And some originality too. Ripping off your Act 1 set from your 1990 production of ""La boheme"" (Christian's rooftop apartment) doesn't pass as a tribute, tip-of-the-hat, or homage with me.",Moulin Rouge!

Seeing Moulin Rouge is like entering a dream world. The setting & the scenes in the first half an hour of the movies are like the subconscious mind. I think memory is like this, they're impressions more than facts. okok, back to the topic. I went to see the movie 'cause I'm a fan of Ewan McGregor & I like musicals. It ends up I got more than I wanted. The songs are great. Without the characters singing, I think I couldn't have empathy w/ them (the storyline is quite weak). The songs help the plot to develop so that There's no need to lay hints for the characters to fall in love w/ eachother. Even one song is enough to show us their love. (Music is a world language) Also, Nichole Kidman acts well & she makes me have empathy to her. (also I'm a female, I can put myself in her role better)Although I like McGregor more in his wilder roles (like in ""Velvet Goldmine"" & ""Transpotting""), I still enjoy seeing him as the sensitive writer.

If there was a great dance sequence in there I missed it. On the other hand Jim Broadbent is great as Zidler. Shame I can't be as positive about Kidman and McGregor. There was no chemistry between them and it was impossible to believe in their 'love.'It seems to me this film is walking a tightrope between utter brilliance and cringe inducing embarrassment.

No doubt, I will see it again this weekend, and it's funny to me that as much of a ride the film was, there are many parts that I do not remember.  Perhaps that was part the joy, of being taken for such a wild rush that everything becomes a blur.  From when the curtains lifted (people who have seen the film will know what I mean) to the very end, I was absolutely transfixed.  The director here did a flawless job of transporting the audience to another time and place, that despite its surrealness and displacement of time and culture, felt very real.  Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman and the entire cast was brilliant, but the real star here are the images that the director delivers to us.  A seamless stich of computer animation and sound stages, Technicolor and grainy B&W, the visual pyrotechnics need to be seen and experienced to be believed.  Echoing a statement from another IMDB user, I would feel very sorry for you if you do not enjoy this film.",Moulin Rouge!
907,JessicaLouise,"Spectacular, Spectacular",9,15 June 2001,"Despite my dislike of Nicole Kidman, I decided that this was a movie that I needed to see.  I truly have never seen anything like it.  It's a musical, set in 1899, that uses sappy 1990's love songs.  The costumes, the sets, the singing, the dancing, the love story... everything is amazing and inventive. Ewan McGregor's voice is absolutely beautiful (I must say, I was quite surprised).  Normally, if I cry at movies at all, I do so at or near the end.  But Chrisian, Ewan McGregor's character, made me cry the first time he sang to Satine (Nicole Kidman).  It is very over the top, but the romance still seems legitimate and believable. This movie is absolutely worth seeing - I will probably go again.  The music is amazing.",Moulin Rouge!
908,nouvelle,The greatest movie I've seen in a LONG LONG time,10,3 June 2001,"Before this movie came out, I saw the Lady Marmalade video and I was really looking forward to this movie.  Then, the first few minutes of the movie, everything was moving so fast I started to hate it.  THere was soo much going on it didn't give the audience time to rest.  I really thought the movie was going to be like that for the rest of the time, and I was starting to get pissed off.  BUt when things slowed down, the whole Moulin Rouge experience takes over.Ewan McGregor is soo fine, he looks soo soulful that now I'm in love with him.  Nicole Kidman was so pretty, and even though I heard those critics say her voice sucked, especially in the high notes, she was pretty damn good -- like what the hell were they talking about??Coming out of the theater with tears streaming down, this movie was soo goood.  THere was even this one chick in the back that started sobbing and wailing really freakin' loud during the sad sad end.  I hope they give this movie a lot of awards, because it really really deserves some.  I've seen a lot of crap in the theaters lately, but this is truly a movie that deserves all the hype.",Moulin Rouge!
909,juliannasculpts,Surprisingly good,5,22 June 2001,"I didn't want to see this movie because the trailers made it look like an elongated version of the music video for their main song. But after several friends with completely different movie tastes recommended it, I finally went out to see for myself--and I was very impressed. More by the cinematography than the story line, but it's got a few surprises packed in there. And while Nicole is credited as the lead role, I found that Ewan's role was somewhat more demanding (at least at the end).",Moulin Rouge!
910,johnsteede,Terrific but depressing,10,24 August 2001,"The way the film started off was very interesting, as it was like a play of some sort and was in an old style from the early 20th century. The first half of the film was amazing, ""spectacular, spectacular!"" even. The film was vibrant for the most part and has interesting combinations of music (""Because We Can"" and ""Lady Marmalade"" at the same time) and the way the characters interact with each other is amazing. However, they give away a major plot point before the first five minutes were over. The whole story was told in flash back, which I personally don't like as one can tell what will occur in the story from how the character is in the beginning. The humor is interestingly different from the norm and is very unique. The musical numbers are primarily in the first hour or so and the vibrant way it is shot shows the emotions the characters were feeling. Then the film turns to a darker point and is very different form the beginning. While the ending seemed to perk up, all of a sudden it turned back to the sadder side. Overall, I still enjoyed the film but it is more of a romantic film then the comedy side shown. The musical aspect was new and very good and I would recommend most people to this film.",Moulin Rouge!

It has comedy elements, jokes, good music for almost everyone's taste, great drama and ... Something it's impossible to describe. That feeling. When you fall in love with this movie. You don't know why is so special to you. But it is.Details? Music is so blurred together with story, it's looks like you watching one big video clip all the time. Performance of everyone - McGregore, Kidman, all other actors - are simply amazing. Singing....It made me a little jealous to McGregore which actually shows how to sing. He sings from heart. I sing with him usually when I listen soundtrack.I won't tell you anything, because again this is the movie which you must see and gain your, very personal opinion.And in shorts words - centuries come and go, love stays.

912,mitzkity,I never expected to like the soundtrack more than the movie.,8,28 June 2001,"You know how disappointed you are when they completely destroy a great book by making it into a mediocre movie?  Well, I listened to the Soundtrack for a month before I had a chance to get to the movie, and I have to say I felt the same way. I had grown so attached to each full-length cut on the CD, I would have been happy with a string of music videos instead of a plot. However, this movie is much more than its music, it's a sensory experience. Much of the music is too deeply buried in that experience for me, but I still give it an 8.  In fact, I'd pay double to be able to see it again - - in slow motion!!I also have to say that the movie's lush surroundings just bowled me over! With so much staging and constant activity, music within music, plots within plays within plots, it was okay for the main plot to be a bit unimpressive. The actors were a bunch of strong characters and Nicole Kidman's incredible accuracy of pitch was a happy surprise!!  Who knew??  Throw in the humor, the surrealistic historical venue of Moulin Rouge, and the bows to dozens of musical hits from the past and it's a rollercoaster ride!  No, more like a pinball table with me crying ""Tilt"". And then, I felt dizzy and kind of slapped in the face when it ended.This was one of the most unusual movies I have seen in years, and when I think back on it, all I can say is ""Hurry Up, DVD"".

916,Poubel,A rare 10,10,5 June 2001,"A rating of 10 should be only for a movie that captivates you, whose plotline sticks in your head for days on end. Moulin Rouge is one of the now 11 movies in my lifetime that has earned such a distinction.And now, to respond to some of the harsh criticism I've read:1. ""The first scene in the club is too fast-paced, and too overwhelming."" Well, could someone please provide me with two better adjectives to describe what someone in Christian's shoes would feel, straight off the bourgeois train and into the Moulin Rouge?2. ""The plotline is weak"". I'll channel Alexandre Dumas Fils and let him know that, after 140 years, it turns out that his play doesn't cut the mustard. Shall I inform Shakespeare while I'm at it?3. ""The songs is anachronistic."" Not so, not so. Not a word is out of place. If you'll listen carefully, you'll notice that there is not a single word sung that would not make sense in 1900 (e.g., deleting the reference to the Automat in Diamonds). Christian even admits that it's modern and might take a while for Satine to get used to. So what if the songs were written after the story is set - name a musical that isn't!If anything, the music shows just how much pop culture is dependent upon the creative powers and love of freedom Les Bohemes celebrated. I suppose you'd have similar criticism for Jesus Christ, Superstar for not singing in the style of the ancient romans; or for that matter, Carmen for singing in French!Woe to those who cross my path in criticism of Le Moulin Rouge.

Okay, now we can concentrate on the ever so predictable path to the end of the film. Throw in some admittedly very good music and dancing, albeit shamelessly over-produced and over-acted, and you have Moulin Rouge, version 2001.The best bit was the CG graphic of the Paris roofscape in 1900.

918,2bfree,Probably not the musical you are thinking of,7,2 June 2001,"The word ""musical"" usually makes me think of those films from vintage cinema or those Disney animated films.  Moulin Rouge is not like this. The movie's tone is a bit more serious and contains suggestive dialogue (as it should be considering the setting).  The musical numbers are a mix of both modern-style original and adapted songs such as Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" and Madonna's ""Like a Virgin.""  But, make no mistake -- neither the songs nor the score contain heavy rock-n-roll or electrics; think more along the lines of a full orchestra.I thought the music worked well for this movie and offered a different style of storytelling than the norm.  It had a pretty interesting musical-within-a-musical plot.  The movie itself did seem visually hard-hitting and disjointed at times, especially in the beginning, but it does settle down once the love story gets going, and an emotional one it is.Don't dismiss Moulin Rouge because of your predispositions, because chances are they don't apply in this case.  It's not your typical musical.  Also, it's not so much like Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" -- you can like one and not the other.",Moulin Rouge!
919,carolvt51,Bring back musicals......!,10,8 October 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a revelation. It takes a very good film to hold my attention for 100% screentime, but with Moulin Rouge this was no problem at all.  My only question is: why aren't more musicals made?  This film was sensational. Countless reviewers have already passed comments that I would reiterate over and over again, so I won't go repeating things that have already been said.  Needless to say, Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor were absolutely riveting whenever they were on screen.  Ewan was enchanting and Nicole absolutely stunning.  And the musical score and the whole musical production was incredible.  I am running out of adjectives already......this film really did it for me. If it is not up there as an Oscar contender next March I will be very disappointed.......and it will, no doubt, be down to the American critics if it doesn't make it.  It's a massive hit in Europe - as it was expected to be.  Critics are not paid so much attention to here - we generally like to make up our own minds.  Long Live Baz Luhrman!",Moulin Rouge!
920,alveyblue,Exploiting the Best,8,1 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge is one of the best cinematic experiences I have seen in years. Baz Luhrman takes his directorial style to new heights with this soaring story of love.  At the heart of the movie is the simplest idea.  All you need is love. Now...for the cynical moviegoer...this won't be enough to sustain your interest for two hours.   But for the moviegoer who loves to believe in love, this movie delivers. Set admist the very un-romantic setting of a french brothel in 1900 is a story of true romance.  AND IT'S A MUSICAL!!! Firt...a note on musicals...the theory behind musicals isn't to be cheesy as many moviegoers feel.  It is said that characters in musicals sing and dance because they have to.  They've expressed all of their emotions in speech and need a new platform to convey their feelings.  So they sing...they sing for life...for love...and for the world.  Granted...it gives the performer a chance to show off his abilities...to wow the audience with a number or two. But it is meant to express the charcters inner feelings.That's what Moulin Rouge does.  Going with the convention of using modern day lyrics in 1900 France...the musical numbers explode from the screen. Baz is a master of eye candy...but beneath his candy is feeling...passion and romance.  Maybe the lead vocals were doctored.  To quote history...Audrey Hepburn did not do all of her own singing in MY FAIR LADY and that is considered a masterpiece.  Entire characters vocal tracks were dubbed in THE KING and I and even recently in EVERYBODY SAYS I LOVE YOU a nice musical as well)  Drew Barrymore was obviously overdubbed.  Those stars of movie musicals inthe past weren't the greatest singers either...but they emoted...just like Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor. This is coming from a person who is not an avid musical fan.  I hate the cheesy MY FAIR LADY's and GIGI's and anything with Rodger or Hammerstein in the title.  I like the musicals that speak to the audience in a real way. Like Cabaret...or Chorus Line.  Moulin Rouge spoke to me.  It created a world where love is possible...and not only possible...but wonderful. Where love can make you sing. Visually the movie is like nothing before.  Baz exploits all the best of cinema.  With his quick takes, and moving camera, and extreme close-ups you see all the little sublties in a not so subtle movie.To pause on that...the movie isn't subtle.  That isn't its intention...the musical from 1960 and before isn't subtle.  Its not supposed to be.  TO use current lyrics is brilliant by Baz.  It allows the viewers to be connected and still experience a musical.  Something which is foreign to modern movie-goers. Baz is trying to recreate the musical...which is needed. There is talk of RENT and CHICAGO being movies.  I hope they are.  So few people view the theatre anymore...and what better way to expose them to it but to bring it to the movies. Back to the movie...to truly experience the movie you have to let yourself go...accept the blatantness of the movie and allow all of its conventions to surround.  It is more than a two hour music video...it is a simple story of love...where every emotion is so great...the characters must sing. The characters will carry you away.  Ewan is moving as the lost poet with love in his heart...and Kidman is appropriately fetching and sensistive. They float this movie up into the moonlit scenes that much of it takes place in. I'm hoping the academy doesn't look over Jim Broadbent who steals everyscene he is in...like the Emcee of Cabaret Broadbent embodies the feeling of the Moulin Rouge.  He is the abandoment of the club...but more than that he is its heart.  John Leguizamo...who may become a Baz staple...is very scene stealing and very effective. In sum...the cast shines...the movie shines...and you will want to talk about it after it is over.  See the movie which EXPLOITS (in a good way) all that cinema has to offer.",Moulin Rouge!
921,dragonbirdyellow,This film is exceptional,10,28 November 2001,"Musicals is one of my favorite film genres. Before Moulin Rouge, The Sound of Music is the only musical movie (in English) in my classic list.The development of love story in Moulin Rouge is not twisted, actually it is quite simple. But it does not mean it is boring. The above-all and heart-breaking love between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor keeps captivating you completely from beginning to end. The excellent performance of leading actors bring us great enjoyment both visually and emotionally and bring the film an exceptional achievement.The songs are fantastic. When they are sung, it seems they are drifting from the remote heaven, or flowing out from deep heart, so beautiful. The dancing is also entertaining. The costume is visually rich and pleasant.I am glad I did not miss it in the theater. It is most enjoyed on a big screen, a lot of effect will be either substantially weaken or lost when watching it on video or DVD.I am wondering how long I have to wait for another Moulin Rouge or The Sound of Music to be filmed?",Moulin Rouge!
922,jctyler1,YUCK!,1,12 April 2002,"This movie stole my life from me (subjectively, this thing lasted an eternity and so is still sucking the life from me as I write this).  I can not beleive that ANYONE actually liked this piece of crap.  Don't waste your time or your money on this stink burger!",Moulin Rouge!
923,HESedit,Dizzying kaleidoscope,5,20 February 2002,"For lovers of the musical theater (a purer venue for musical plays than film), the PR for Moulin Rouge was very tempting, especially given the calliope of popular songs featured in the soundtrack.  Viewed on the small screen (as I did), it no doubt lost some of its dazzling effectiveness, but I think if I'd seen it in a movie theater I might have become uncomfortably dizzy. The production is almost blindingly colorful and there is so much going on visually that it is hard to take it all in.   It is a jangling jumble of many parts--circus sideshow, fantasy, romance, dark comedy, and burlesque.  It's as if Baz Luhrmann made every movie he's ever wanted to make, all in one.The performances were fine, however, and there were plenty of compelling moments.  The sweet singing voices of both Satine (Nicole Kidman) and Christian (Ewan McGregor) were the biggest surprise.  Unfortunately, I didn't really feel their chemistry and the contrast between their mutual love and their disdain for the bad duke (Richard Roxburgh) could have been drawn more clearly for better dramatic effect.  Jim Broadbent--who played the conflicted Zidler, proprietor of the Moulin Rouge--of all the actors, seemed to grasp the need for a bigger-than-life performance.  John Leguizamo, a wonderful character actor, had too little to do as Toulouse-Lautrec.The movie only partly worked, and it was the basic innocence and universality of the appealing story that saved it from finally exploding like an ambitious science experiment with too many ingredients.",Moulin Rouge!
924,sazzichic,It's About Time,9,6 January 2002,"Moulin Rouge was performed and directed beautifully. Finally, a nice story, that also happens to be a song and dance musical, but done in a modern perspective. It's a perfect rainy-day movie to take home and watch again and again.",Moulin Rouge!
925,Bruno Morphet,Awful.,1,1 November 2001,"I lasted about 50 minutes in this movie until Jim Broadbent's leering ginger mug repulsed me so much I had to leave. There is no denying the beauty of the art direction here, but it really is the proverbial purse made from a sow's ear. The script is appalling, the plot paper thin. In the grand tradition of all those terrible puppet shows your parents made you sit through when you were a child, there are characters who exist for no reason other than to add a sort of aural punctuation to the main characters songs and sentences. John Leguizamo's entire dialogue seems to consist of beeps and squeaks at appropriate moments. Then there are the songs...ah yes...the songs. If you want to shake things up a bit and ""re-invent"" genres, which Luhrman is no doubt trying to do, is dull radio fodder like Elton John really the way to go? The choice of such songs smacked of product placement. Beyond this, add the fact that Ewan Mcgregor cannot sing, Kidman's voice was flat, and both of them gave up trying to act before the movie had even begun, and you have an undeniably excruciating experience.",Moulin Rouge!

927,morningperson_2000,"I am in love with ""Moulin Rouge""!!",10,22 May 2001,"I am in love with a movie, and that movie is ""Moulin Rouge."" This occurrence happens maybe once or twice in a decade, if one is lucky: a movie comes along that so dazzles, excites, and shakes up your notions of what a movie should be, so exceeds and surpasses your expectations as to leave you completely dazed and dazzled. For me ""Moulin Rouge"" was all that and more. Firstly, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were absolutely brilliant. Their performances were two of the most human, beautiful creations I have ever seen any actors create. Secondly, the visual design was the most sumptuous, eye-popping, fantastical one I have ever seen. The colors were so bright and awe-inspiring that it seemed to be one, long, beautiful dream. And some of the special effects were so unexpected and delightful that I will never forget them. Thirdly, the score was absolutely brilliant. Blending songs that are classic standards, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, with modern pop songs written by the likes of the Beatles, Madonna, Elton John, and even Nirvana, and then reworking these songs into operatic-sounding pieces of musical theatre, Baz Luhrmann, the director, has finally accomplished what we have been waiting all too long for: the first great post-modern musical. Recent attempts, such as ""Dancer in the Dark,"" have tried but failed to accomplish this, because they did not have their full heart in the musical aspect of the piece. ""Dancer in the Dark,"" for example, had only 6 or 7 songs, most of which were quite short. In contrast, ""Moulin Rouge"" blends at least 30 songs in its mammoth, brilliant score. Most amazingly, all of the songs fit perfectly, despite their varied sources, and the lyrics are so perfect you would think they were written for these characters. The musical numbers themselves are so fantastically staged and choreographed that the audience in the Ziegfeld Theatre in NYC, where I saw it, spontaneously burst into applause at the close of almost every one, as if it was live theatre. That is I believe the greatest testament to the power of this film. It made people laugh, it made people cry, it made people, most of whom did not seem to be fans of musical theatre, sing. The movie got an honest to God standing ovation at the end, much like I heard happened at Cannes. When the actors names appeared at the end, people cheered, as they did when the director's name came up. Do yourself a favor, and throw all your preconceptions of this film out the window. Whether you are a fan of musical theatre or not, I can almost guarantee you will, if not fall madly in love with this movie as I have, have an experience the likes of which you have never had before. And that is saying a lot for an age when completely original films are so few and far between. Yes, ""Moulin Rouge"" copies cliches from many different mythic and musical sources, but it does so only to deconstruct them, turn them on their head, and create one of the most satisfying cinematic worlds I have ever seen.",Moulin Rouge!
928,morningperson_2000,"I am in love with ""Moulin Rouge""!",10,31 August 2001,"I have not ever felt for a movie the way I do about ""Moulin Rouge.""  It is not just a movie...it is a cinematic experience the likes of which I have never before seen. The story, the music, the acting, the visual imagery strikes emotion in me I never before thought possible from a film. It is without a doubt the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I have ever seen. It is dizzy, maddening, beautiful, and heartbreaking!  The music is rapturous, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices compliment each other and the story perfectly.  This movie takes its story to a mythic level and surrounds these two star-crossed lovers with music and imagery that simply will take your breath away.  The story is grand, huge, and operatic, as is the music. The brilliant score skillfully weaves many modern, popular songs, and rescores them as the libretto to this grand opera. There are some images in this film unlike anything you have ever seen. And the performances are absolutely incredible, particularly Nicole Kidman's.  I truly felt for these two people, and truly felt that they were in love.  My heart broke into a million pieces for them every time I saw this movie, and I've seen it 8 times. It's an absolutely breathtaking, visionary, masterpiece that did not get the credit it deserved by American critics, who seem to complain that every movie is the same. Yet when an original, daring, shocking film like this comes along, they don't know what to do with it. But then again, this really is not just a film. No mere film could strike me the way this one has, in a way that reaches to the very fibres of my being in a way only ""The Wizard of Oz"" ever has before.

I hate it's set design, and how it tries to make up for the movies lack of excitement.  I hate it's sub-Mills and Boone storyline.  I hate the way it desecrates one of my favourite songs (Smells Like Teen Spirit), despite how short that bit is. I hate the way that it seems to have fooled otherwise intelligent people into thinking that flashy editing, pretty colours and loud music somehow makes a film good.Lurhmann has never made a good film and this is his worst yet.

This film went over so well with our audience that at the end there was complete silence as if in respect and appreciation for the film, out of 300 or so people only a handful left before the credits were over. And when the credits finished a huge cheer arose. It was like nothing I've ever experienced at the movies. I walked straight out of the movie and bought the cd, its fantastic! I'm listening to Valeria's track 5 right now it's awesome!I might be biased cos I'm an Aussie but this has been the best film I Have seen in years. A great visual stimulation, my friend called the first 40 minutes a full body assault that attacked all the senses, you certainly can't sleep thru it! And thru-out the film there are many aussies who put in an appearance which adds a greater excitement for Australian audiences but don't worry there is enough to keep everyone interested in this film.There are some stand out performances from Nicole and Ewan McGregor who carve up the screen with Come What May the shows only original love song. Also Jim Broadbent is a real asset who adds a lot to this film and John Leguizamo who plays Telous the dwarf well without detracting focus from the movies leads!I am so proud that this is an Aussie production and not only is it the best we've produced but I think it'll put its mark on the world and make people stand up and take note at what us Aussies can do!I highly recommend this film, its a simulation ride thru time with amazing sets, costumes and acting talent. 5 stars go and see it at the cinemas your a fool if u don't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Moulin Rouge!

Let's use songs we already know people loved, big top 40 tunes only of course, and then let's set as a backdrop a dieing prostitute falling madly in love with an impoverished writer, using about 40000 cuts per hour filled with wild whacky sound effects as we zoom in on somebody's face and call it a blockbuster. My good friend and fellow critic calls this ""Better than Casa Blanca"". I weep for his future children.

However, it is one of the few musicals produced at all in the past couple of decades. Since the AFI ""experts"" seem to have only a superficial knowledge of films prior to 1960, this gets the film in the top 25. A similar pattern of temporal bias afflicts most of the other AFI lists.

Very dramatic, full of theatre, drama and comedy.If you have no care for Truth, Beauty, Freedom or Love - or any music, then you may not care for this movie.  Everyone else should.  I don't normally care for musicals.  People bursting in to song usually seem rather out of place.  In Moulin Rouge, the surreal nature of the whole movie is maintained and the singing seems not only natural, but essential.  The integration of song and dialog is brilliant, often with no obvious border.The cinematography is superb, with some sweeping zoom & pan from one shot to another supporting the surreal fantasy feeling.There is some similar tongue-in-cheek style to Strictly Ballroom (also from Baz Luhrmann)In my opinion there is no question this is the best movie ever made.

937,tim__lee,There really is a plot under all the music and camp drama,10,10 August 2001,"This movie seems to generate comments that are extreme one way or the other. If you 'get it' - you'll love it.  Some people just don't 'get it'.  Many people complain about it's lack of plot, or overly simplified storyline.There is a clever multiple layered story, the movie is about itself. Christian is a penniless artist - a writer specifically, writing a story which reflects his own story, about a penniless artist & his lover.  The second time I saw it I realised that quite early in the movie he tells us the ending of the movie, just a quick line that I missed the relevance of first time.  It is all the more tasty when the movie anti-hero needs some prompting to see that the story played out in front of him is also happening around him, and he still doesn't quite know what's going on until it's too late.Then there is the Tango, a marvelously dark rendition of Roxanne.  The dance on the ground floor plays out what is happening upstairs, and although we only see tantalising flashes of Satine & the Count, the dancers fill in all the details.  This is presented at such a pace that it leaves the viewers almost as breathless as the dancers, which is not a reason to hate it, but the key to the emotional power of this movie.Moulin Rouge never pretends to be a faithful rendition of 19th century Paris.  Rather it uses that which viewers of a century later might be familiar with to convey the spirit of bohemian Montemartre.Moulin Rouge is not just a movie, it is an Experience.  An Experience I doubt I'll ever forget.  If there is a problem with this movie, it is that it makes me realise how empty other movies are - like realising that all those '5 star' ratings were actually out of 10, and I've now seen the real 10/10, and I now know what I've been missing.",Moulin Rouge!

943,HFenderchick,Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place,10,9 January 2002,"I picked up Moulin Rouge at the rental store thinking ""What the heck? At least I can say I saw it,"" thinking it wouldn't be that good.  Boy was I wrong!  I should have known I would fall hopelessly in love with the movie. Baz Luhrman(director, most well known for his direction of Romeo and Juliet) is a genius seeing scenes and putting them together in a way that no one else would have done.  The editing is fantastic and really brings out so much emotion whether it is happy, sad, or hilarious.  I have never really seen many Nicole Kidman films but this has given me a whole new respect for her and I am a fan for life.  She is a remarkably talented actress from every word to every blink.  Her facial expressions can stir emotions inside you that you never knew were there.  You could always tell what she was feeling and she made it very apparent when she was Satine the actress and Satine the woman in love.  I was so surprised to hear how wonderfully she sings and never thought I would have a ""Nicole Kidman CD"" I can't say enough good things about her performance.  I have seen a few films starring Ewan McGregor and loved every one of them, this one tops the cake.  As the naive man in love with a woman everyone wants, he is so wonderful and his voice makes him that much more. (if I say anything else great about his performance I will spoil the movie) Kidman and McGregor have fantastic on-screen chemistry causing that wonderful warm fuzzy feeling  (""it's a little bit funny this feeling inside"") whenever they are together in the scenes.  This is a picture you never want to end but it does and all you can do is rewind and watch it over and over again.  Any film that does a music mix of ""Lady Marmalade"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" gets a 10+ in my book. This isn't a movie for everyone, but for those of you who love great music, true love, and an all around craziness complete with a new cover of ""Like a Virgin"" you will be happily surprised with the masterpiece of Moulin Rouge! which in my opinion will be a classic that people will be enjoying for a million years to come.  ""It's spectacular spectacular, no word from your vernacular...  So exc-i-ting the audience will stop and cheer, so de-light-ing it will run for 50 years!""",Moulin Rouge!
944,The Mad Reviewer,"Spectacular, Spectacular!",9,23 January 2002,"MOULIN ROUGE! (2001) Rating: 9/10Director and co-writer (with Craig Pearce) Baz Luhrmann describes the style he brought to the Australian dance flick Strictly Ballroom and his underrated take on William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet as ""red curtain theatricality"". He likes to deal with familiar types of stories (so the audience knows how it will end) taking place in sort of a heightened reality, with plenty of devices reminding the audience that they're watching a movie. Moulin Rouge! is a perfect example of that. It's not interested in the banal and the realistic, it's Cinema!!, with a capital 'C' and plenty of exclamation points! Music! Flying colors! Dancing! Emotions set free! Slapstick! LOVE! The red curtain opens (literally) and then we're off for one wild ride, a rocky electric cancan boogie playing over a love rollercoaster, as seen through the lenses of a filmmaker with a vision equal parts Méliès, Technicolor 1950s musicals and MTV.It's quite overwhelming at first, but in a good way. Luhrmann's frenetic back and forth camerawork puts you in the same state of mind as Christian as he enters the Moulin Rouge for the first time. On one side powdered girls are doing their thing, chanting the ""Voulez-Vous couchez avec moi?"" chorus from ""Lady Marmelade"", while across the way a bunch of men in tuxedos are emulating Kurt Cobain and proclaiming ""Here we are now, entertain us..."", meanwhile Zigler is screaming ""Because you can can-can!"" on Fatboy Slim's electronic beats... And then Satine floats down on a trapeze crooning ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friends"" and takes everybody's breath away... The men's, Christian's... Ours.That's another thing; it's good to be able to craft energetic, entertaining musical numbers, but there's the danger to end up with a futile, purposeless costume revue. This never happens here because, as familiar and melodramatic as the story can be, it still involves us completely. We really feel for these passionate lovers doomed to hide their affair. When we see Satine for the first time, we fall in love with her along with Christian, and we root for him, for them, through the rest of the film. The delightfully twisted musical numbers that punctuate their tale aren't gratuitous but integral to the drama. Most every important declaration is made through song, be it Christian belting out Elton John's ""Your Song"" (""How wonderful life is while you're in the world..."") or Satine serenading him with ""Come What May"" (one of the movie's few originals, and a great one at that - expect an Oscar nomination), or the both of them discoursing about love with lyrics from famous songs from The Beatles, Kiss, David Bowie, Paul McCartney, Joe Cocker, Whitney Houston. Plus, not only to the songs fit in thematically, they're also reinvented in original ways. The Police's ""Roxane"" becomes a tango, Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" becomes a show tune...
Then there's the outrageous sets and costumes, the frantic choreography, the endless variety of camera angles and editing tricks... And above all, love, as communicated by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in what could be career peaks for both. Kidman is just lovable, sexy, warm and goofy, nothing like the icy bombshell she once appeared to be. McGregor is at the other end of the spectrum from diving into toilets, all charm and idealism, love obsessed writer, blue-eyed dreamer... And when put together, extraordinary chemistry erupts, they just gel together, they BELONG with one another! And they can sing too! Who knew these two had such nice voices? They're nicely surrounded by a cast of enjoyably caricatural supporting characters, from John Leguizamo's high-on-absinthe dwarf to Jim Broadbent's life of the party burly man and Richard Roxburgh' moustache-twirling Snidely Whiplash of a villain.Moulin Rouge! is what film lovers have been waiting for all year. Here's a movie that makes you giddy with joy and eager to see it again and again. Spectacular Spectacular indeed!",Moulin Rouge!
945,jdorries,I thought this was a wonderfully imaginative film.,10,9 April 2002,"This film was a breath of fresh air for me. It was unlike anything I'd seen before. It showed such imagination and energy and yet allowed me to relate to the characters. I think it's a crime that Baz Luhrmann and Ewan McGregor weren't nominated for Academy Awards.  It was very brave for a film like this to be made. Hopefully, Baz Luhrmann will make more like this.",Moulin Rouge!
946,daniel_diesing,Why did God allow this to Happen!,1,13 May 2002,"One morning my mother woke me up to watch this movie, I have not yet forgiven her. In this movie the cast from Romeo&Juliet got together and sang a remix of every song that was on the top 40 list since 1969. The format for this movie was entirely new; although, me standing on my head and peeing is new, but you don't see me doing that.",Moulin Rouge!
947,sexy_fouchet,best musical/romance ever!!!,10,9 November 2002,"ever since I've seen the movie I've been searching for soundtrack,cause the music is so brilliant.Nicol and Ewan are just great as Satine and Christian,and not only that they can act,they can sing great as well.Jim Broadbent is great as Satines crazy pimp who also sings.Leguizamo as Toulouse is funny with his mixing of letters r and l with v,every time he gets in the seen.Jacek Koman who plays The Unconscious Argentinean is just great in singing and dancing parts,especially ""El Tango de Roxanne"".i was only sad because of the ending.beautiful cast,great music,original  10+/10",Moulin Rouge!
948,Satua,More than perfect...,10,18 October 2002,"... piece of entertainment! I might have seen greater movies than this but as an entertaining piece of art... No-one does it better than Luhrmann, and thanks to him, I fall in love every time I watch it. And it gets better and better. I wonder what it's going to be after ten years time",Moulin Rouge!
949,leez34,The worst movie ever made (kinda spoilers),1,21 January 2003,"My friends and I like to get together just to talk about this one.  We've had several conversations just debating the finer points of what make this movie so terrible.  We have an insanely confusing plot - OK, Nicole Kidman seduces the wrong guy?  None of us even figured that out until way at the end of the movie, after spending a seemingly endless amount of time wondering what was going on.  It is filled with other people's music that range from annoying (""So exciting!"") to horrible and pointless (""Roxanne""). Five and a half hours of meaningless dreck.  Loved only by swooning girls and pompous film critics.  I think I actually want to see it again, just to confirm all the main reasons it's horrible.",Moulin Rouge!
950,Blockmary,Wouldn't watch it again.,3,12 February 2003,"Moulin Rouge is visually stunning. The use of colors and lighting is unlike any other movie I've seen. Pop rock over the past two decades has been revamped, and is well suited to the scenes in which it is played. This is where my infatuation with the film ends.I watched Chicago last weekend, and was unable to peel my eyes from the screen. Moulin Rouge was a different story. The movie dragged heavily. I feel that all focus was placed on making the movie an audio/visual masterpiece, sacrificing a quality storyline. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor give good performances, but the plot failed to interest me the slightest bit. In my opinion, this a film that brings a unique concept to the table that critics immediately hail. I found it to be stimulating, but a waste of two hours at the same time.I gave the movie a 4/10 simply for the unique set, use of color, and the ingenuity in use of refurbished pop songs in an early 1900s Paris setting. As I stated in my summary line, I would not watch the movie again.",Moulin Rouge!
951,movieclocks,The Best Movie I've Ever Seen! Amen!!,10,12 December 2002,"Moulin Rouge is a unique movie. The direction is similar to Baz's Romeo and Juliet. If you didn't like the direction of that movie, you may get annoyed with the brilliance in this one. The love story is the sweetest saddest love story I've ever seen. Lots of movies have great stories but don't get you caring about the characters. This movie makes you care and that makes it great. The design is gorgeous, the music is fabulous. Ewan has an awesome voice and does an awesome job acting as well. To let you know if you and I have the same tastes, to better determine if you will like this movie, here are my top 5 films of all time. 5. Amelie 4. Jerry Maguire 3. O Brother Where Art Thou? 2. Signs 1. Moulin Rouge",Moulin Rouge!
952,athousanddreams,One of the Best,10,12 July 2003,"Even though I'm a sucker for musicals, I wasn't planning on seeing it when it came out.  My cousin took me to see it and I fell in love.  It's now my favorite, or at least one of them.  I seriously went to see it in the theaters 7 times (it was a slow summer).  It's a classic tale of boy falls in love with a girl he can't have and the consequences of that.  Yes, it's over the top.  But that's what makes it wonderful.  In the first ten minutes, you find out how it's going to end, but that's the beauty of Baz. All of the actors are brilliant as well.  Check it out even if you don't like musicals.  My boyfriend used to fast forward through the songs in Disney movies, but even he thought it was great.10/10.  Try and top it.",Moulin Rouge!
953,Gabbiegurl222,careful or you'll miss the point,8,6 June 2005,"People have to be incredibly careful with this movie. If the make the mistake of taking this movie too seriously, and not accepting it as the innocent, romantic, incredibly overblown, over-exaggerated, over-everything that it is, they will be greatly disappointed. Yes it is one cliché-after another. Yes it is over-done almost to the point of distraction. But in a movie like this, the simple things really shine. And it is the simple things that people miss in a lot of large blockbusters. The chemistry between the stars for one. Sheer emotional talent. And God the singing, in any other movie the surprisingly superb vocals of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (who ever guessed Obi-Wan could sing??) would be buried under subplots, and subtleties, and action, and randomly interspersed cameos of huge stars, and bad acting, and everything else the movie industry throws at you to attempt to get you to sit through the movie and give them money. But in a movie like this, a movie that only has the emotion to rely on, the vocals can shine. And God did the shine. Looked at the right light, this movie is a masterpiece.",Moulin Rouge!
954,steubnerrhodes,The greatest thing you'll ever watch is Moulin Rouge!,10,25 October 2004,"I don't understand how anyone could hate this movie! It is my favorite movie of all time. Admittedly, the plot is cliché, but no one can claim that the plot keeps the movie from being unique. I have never seen anything remotely similar to Moulin Rouge. It is an incredible feast for your eyes; the set and costumes have such vibrant color that if they were the only good thing about the movie, you would still be entertained. The script is wacky and amusing, but also sentimental and moving. The acting was real; my heart broke for Christian every time he was jealous or hurt, because the pain on his face was real. Ewan McGregor is a phenomenal actor, and has the most pleasing male voice I have ever heard. Nicole Kidman is also superb, both as an actress and a singer. The movie moves quickly, but is easy to follow as long as you pay attention, and certainly keeps you from being bored. The songs, though familiar modern tunes, are blended and arranged in an original way, that could not be conceived by anyone other than a genius. Moulin Rouge never fails to excite, amuse, enthrall, or captivate me. I have seen it four times now, in the past 2 months, and have never managed to make it all the way through without crying. Despite the borrowed songs and cliché love story that drive the film, I have never seen a more original production.",Moulin Rouge!
955,ainsleyrix,Fantastic!,10,23 December 2004,"I absolutely love this film, I haven't seen it in ages, but I don't need to, I know it's brilliant! The songs are absolutely amazing, it made me want to be a Moulin Rouge girl. Nicole Kidman is absolutely stunning as Satine, red hair suits her so much, she was very sexy. Ewan McGregor looked pretty fine too, and Nicole and Ewan really made me believe that they were in love. It was a bit of a culture shock after I watched it and I realised they weren't together! The sets and the special effects were very, very realistic, I think this might be the most brilliant musical of all time! I watched it about a thousand times, listening to it, writing down the songs and joining in with the dancing, come to think of it, I think I'll watch it right now!",Moulin Rouge!
956,LucretiaBorg,Wauw!!!!,10,7 April 2005,"I thought I'd seen it all, but that was before Moulin Rouge. Normally I'm not a real musical lover, although I loved Jesus Christ Superstar, Hair, Tommy and a few others, but like JCS, which was a weird musical too, this one also rocked my world. Songs from Madonna to Marilyn Monroe and everything in between, the good actors (I didn't know Nicole Kidman could also sing, is there anything she can't do? and of cause nobody could top Ewan), the beautiful clothes, jewelery, dancing, great songs, all beautiful made by Baz, who I thought already was a genius after Romeo and Juliet, but now, how does he plan to top this one. The only weird thing was that a musical like Chigaco, that was really bad if you don't count Richard Gere (he looks good in every movie), won all kinds of Oscars, but not Moulin Rouge???? Shame on the people at the academy. They give Nicole enough credit, but always for the wrong movies. I don't like the Botox-Kidman, but I love her in almost every movie, especially this one. A big TEN!!!",Moulin Rouge!
957,amurdoch92,One of My Favourites of ALL time - Classic,10,26 April 2005,"What a incredible film, with such staggeringly perfect script. A wonderful story line that would make ANYONE upset, great performances by Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent.It has everything going for it, the music is sensational the directing superb! The story of a forbidden romance that is in the end united than stricken with doubt then collapses with the death of Nicole's character.This is no doubt one of the most magnificent films of era and should have been showered with Oscar's and Golden Globe's. This is a great film and should be recognized for the accomplishment as a grand film.",Moulin Rouge!

959,Hjr41,Moulin Rouge,10,22 October 2017,"Moulin Rouge is a tour de force of artifice, a dazzling pastiche of musical and visual elements at the service of a blatantly artificial story. Lumpish biopic, historically laughable as it pursues Hollywood's perennial view of the artist as solitary and star-crossed in both life and love. What taste can do, Huston does, abetted by Paul Sheriff's set designs and some fine colour camera-work from Oswald Morris. But playing Toulouse Lautrec on his knees, Ferrer could equally well be begging for mercy from the script. Best bit is the first reel, which evokes the spirit of Paris in the Naughty Nineties in a swirling mass of colour and movement.",Moulin Rouge!
960,sixshooterbob,Stunning,9,13 May 2019,"Full disclosure. I am not a fan of musicals. I'm a lover of epic westerns, film noir of the late 40s, classic syfy and dark comedies. But my wife likes musicals so I rented this years ago. I was captivated from the opening scene. Within 20 minutes I longed to be in Paris in 1899. I wanted to be a bohemian artist. I wanted a tiny apartment with perking paint and a view of the Seine. What a story! The naysayers who were bored by this must be very cold and unimaginative souls indeed. The film swept me along and at the end I was so glad I had experienced it. Possibly the only film both my wife and I love unconditionally. We now have tapes, dvds, blue rays, and I'm sure whatever the next generation of electronic entertainment is we'll get that too. Timeless stuff and Hollywood at it's best.",Moulin Rouge!
961,elorasabine,This Movie Was Not For Me,3,29 January 2002,"Say there is a painting in a gallery that is worth $1,000,000.  Art critics, my friends, other people go on and on about how great this painting is.  I am excited to go to the gallery and see it.  I go, look at the painting, and am shocked that I don't see the triumph that others talk about.  I see a grotesque thing.  Are the people who think the painting is great wrong? Definitely not.  Am I wrong for being in the minority of dissenters who wouldn't hang this painting in my house even if it was free? No.I believe movies are both art and craft.  All art has a different influence on and meaning for each individual who views it.In short, I severely disliked Moulin Rouge.  I will never view it again.
Am I uneducated, mislead, stupid, etc.?  No, and neither are those many of you who loved this movie.Do I need to consult source material (Orpheus or other literature recommended in previous reviews) and ""educate"" my ignorant self?  No. Will consulting other material make me miraculously love this film?  No.  I don't think one needs to have studied ""The Odyssey"" to enjoy ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"".I was on a date in an art museum once and my date hated a painting that was by my favorite artist (not Toulouse-Latrec :-)).  I asked my date, was there at least something about the painting, anything at all, he liked?  He came up with the brilliant answer:  ""Pretty colors.""On a similar note, there were two things I liked about this film.  (1) The ""Roxanne"" number.  I will never think of the song in the same way again. (2)  Ewan McGregor.  I've liked him in everything he has been in.  He did a valiant job in this role.",Moulin Rouge!
962,GrayBear-3,What a mess!,2,3 October 2002,"Nicole Kidman is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful women ever. And I always thought that I could watch her eating a bowl of cereal and be content.  But I can't sit through this mess.  In fact, I'd rather watch her eating a bowl of cereal, it would make more sense.  Maybe it's the fact that the original ""Moulin Rouge"" was such a splendid film that predisposes me to hate this.I firmly believe that in the 6th level of Dante's inferno, they play this film over and over.",Moulin Rouge!
963,brightersuns,Unfortunately Terrible,4,2 February 2002,"I was unaware what to expect from this faux-musical, so I expected the worst. Tragically, I was proven right. While this film will not make my 10 Worst Films list, it's pretty close, and only Luhrmann's visually exciting direction kept me from leaving. If you're researching a paper on Luhrmann, this might be worth seeing; otherwise it serves as a stark reminder of why musicals went out of fashion so many years ago.",Moulin Rouge!
964,DbNatura,Spectacular Spectacular,10,7 June 2001,"I think that the ""El Tango de Roxanne"" scene may be the finest ever filmed. Period!  Ewan McGregor shows such a breadth and depth in this movie.  His other work has showcased his range, but never has one picture shown all of it.  Nicole Kidman was a revelation.  I'd never thought of her much one way or the other before this movie, but she was wonderful.  The supporting cast were all brilliant.If there aren't at least Academy Award nominations for the 6 or 7 main characters, Baz Luhrman, set design, costumes and best song; then there is no justice in the world.",Moulin Rouge!
965,rkwong,Rush out and see it while it's still on the big screen,10,5 September 2001,"I went into this movie with no more than the barest notions of who the two lead characters were, and the knowledge that this was a musical (or, more accurately, a re-working of the standard movie musical). Since I was afterwards grateful I'd seen it with no pre-conceived ideas, I won't go into detail, except to say that if you haven't viewed it yet, you ought to run out and catch it while it's still playing the big screens.This is a film to be experienced big. With its gorgeously-detailed sets, swooping cameras, wild colors, and soaring music, MR needs to be seen on the same scale that it's presented. Suspend your disbelief when you walk in the theater door, sit back, and take it in. You're stepping into a different world.But not so different that it keeps the heart of the film from ringing true. Kidman and McGregor are are both breathtaking, and they sold me on their characters...and, most important, on each other's characters.And bonus--in this day and age, a film set in a hedonistic nightclub with no gratuitous sex and no gratuitous violence? It's shocking. Absolutely shocking.",Moulin Rouge!
966,Gandalfe,This may be one of the defining films of the decade . . . .,10,3 June 2001,"I rarely write these reviews, mostly because I am rarely moved enough by a film to actually have enough to say.  However, after seeing Moulin Rouge, I find that I must comment on it, and possibly on it's place in our society.Most of the other reviews have mentioned Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's voices, and they are entirely correct.  Both of them harken back to an era when movie star were entertainers and not just media concoctions.  Less evident but equally important in this film are there acting talents, both of which are prodigious.  John Leguizamo pulls off his usual fantastic job, while the other actors are more than equal to their tasks.There are three other pieces to the film that are extremely important, tho. The first, and probably most obvious, is the music - from sweet, to grand, to gutter, the sounds of this movie will blow you away.  It's intriguing how it's done, as most musical have entirely (or mostly) original music, while most of this one is new versions of old songs, and medleys, and bits and pieces, and lyrics set to incongruous music.  It's almost as though the story is being played out through the top 40 radio of the past 30 years, and it works admirably.Secondly, the costumes and set design.  One could not work without the other, but together, they create some of the most beautiful visions I've seen on screen in a long time.Thirdly is Baz Luhrman himself.  Unlike many directors, he is completely present in the film, and you feel his personal involvement in this project more than in either of his previous movies (Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juliet).  Yes, he's somewhat self indulgant, but if it works, this isn't a problem, and it works very well here.If I have any complaint about this movie it's the pacing at the beginning - very, very slow initially, then frenetic.  However, it's like a rollercoaster - it builds and builds until the first drop, when everything goes wild and, in the best cases, you experience red shift.I'm going to have to see this movie again, to see if it inspires me as much the second time around.",Moulin Rouge!
967,WiseFool,If you didn't stay,10,13 June 2001,"Until the house lights came up, then you didn't see the whole movie.  My GF and I always wait until the very end of the film before we leave.  Quite often we're the only ones left.  We were well rewarded this time.  The credits had music better than most films.  Oh, and then at the very end of the credits was a message that all should see.  If you left early, go back, stay in your seat and see.  Watch the credits, respect the people who worked so hard on such a great movie.",Moulin Rouge!
968,JSForth,Spectacular Spectacular,10,24 June 2001,"This is the best movie I've seen since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  The story is lovely.  The cinematography is incredible.  Nicole Kidman is beautiful.  Ewan McGregor is perfect.  It's simply Spectacular Spectacular.",Moulin Rouge!
969,Scott-221,"Eye-candy, artistic -- and unbearable silliness",6,8 June 2001,"I loved the sets, the original songs, and the basic story line was trite but entertaining, and the bits of humor were good, but when they went off into ""Material Girl"" or ""Like a Virgin"" or other modern songs (though ""Your Song"" was done acceptably) I was like, ""This is so stupid!!!!!""",Moulin Rouge!
970,dumbear1,unbelievably bad...total disappointment,1,4 June 2001,"I had anticipated this movie for weeks.  Last night I went to see it and was completely bown away...by what a horrible, no good, rotten waste of celluloid it was. Anyone who claims this movie is anything better than crap is as pretentious as Baz Luhrmann is. THIS MOVIE MADE ME WALK OUT HALF WAY THROUGH. I see at least one movie a week sometimes two and I never walkout. I cannot describe to you how unwatchable this drivel is. Please do us all a favor and avoid it so no one attempts anything like this ever again.",Moulin Rouge!
971,Mistress of the Dim,Tired of Bay and Spielberg? See _Moulin Rouge_!,9,12 June 2001,"My theory?  Some of the people who dislike _Moulin Rouge_ are perhaps the same movie-goers who seem pacified by the thoughtless, uninspired dreck that plagues theatres today.  The same crowd that loves Steven Spielberg's ready-made, static melodramas that tell them how to feel, and the same crowd that drools over Michael Bay's heart-thumping but mind-numbing schlock.Visually stunning, well-acted, and a genuinely inspired, unique experience. Thank you, Baz, for showing us something we've never seen before.",Moulin Rouge!
972,teacherpete,It's like La Boheme on acid.,10,23 February 2002,"I've come to the conclusion that movies can be truly breathtaking art, and this move fits that classification. As a love story by itself, it is strictly according to the formula of tragic love. The way it is presented, however, raises it to a higher level. The sets and costumes were visually stunning, and the staccato presentation of the scenes added to the pleasure. The use of mid to late twentieth century music in a story ostensibly set in 1899 only added to the film's appeal. I highly recommend this picture.",Moulin Rouge!
973,doblerman1227,The BEST film of 2001!,10,26 November 2001,"WOW, what can I say about this absolutely FANTASTIC film, I have never and I mean NEVER, seen a movie, glorify the power and the ecstacy of love, the way it feel, even the way it looks and sounds, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are in top form as the lead characters, and John Leguizamo steals nearly every single scene he is in, and I didn't think Baz Luhrman could top Romeo and Juliet, and boy, was I wrong, and I am glad I was, this movie evoked emotions in me that I never thought a movie could do, the music is fantastic, the production design and the sets were incredible, and are oscar worthy, and everyone in the film gives top notch performances, See this movie immediately!!",Moulin Rouge!
974,zzedzdead,An Exciting Tour Through 20th Century Music!!,9,16 February 2002,"We start off with a relatively ambiguous musical reference to ""The Sound of Music"" and the tour de force of music only progresses from there.  This postmodern masterpiece unlike anything yet envisioned is a gem that should and will be revered for ages to come.  If you have an interest in music this film will not disappoint.  Forget the plot, it is insignificant anyway. Focus on the music!!!  I guarantee you will leave humming the music on your way to purchasing the soundtrack.  The music is threaded together with constant references to Orpheus in the Underworld, especially the can-can portion.  As well Ewan and Nicole put a new light to individual songs as they cover them throughout the ""narrative"".  I cannot describe it as that would give away to many songs, and that is the fun of the film, identifying the dozens of musical references embedded in the movie.  I must say, to end, if you go into watching it thinking of it as a fun, comedic experience you will love it.  However, if you are a serious person, without a sense of humor you will hate it.",Moulin Rouge!
975,chaouatg,a disastrous attempt to recreate Paris 1900 with Madonna music,3,11 May 2001,"Liberation, the French newspaper, says this movie is French CON CON, not can can , a joke meaning it is dumb and dumber. Competing with Huston is a dire problem already faced (with catastrophe) by Roger Planchon, but .....here.....!!The Paris we see is carton pate, the story improbable, and albeit some songs are beautiful, to see and hear modern lyrics (Madonna, Beatles I think)  in an anyway improbable 1900 Paris is the cerise on the Melba. Disastrous Irma la douce Paris was cliche and improbable, but charming. Here, as say Le Monde, it is boring despite some (some) sparkling scenes",Moulin Rouge!
976,jbparker,Utterly Unique,10,24 May 2001,"There is too much in this movie to comment on.  It is fast-paced and breath-taking. It is beautiful and romantic.  It is lush and decadent.  Its is poignant and human.  It is absurd and bizarre.  It will affect your very core. This film is part Broadway Musical, part Opera, part Music Video.  Had someone explained it to me in those terms, I would not have gone.  But I can assure you, as a fan of Opera rather than MTV, that the elements WORK! Ewan McGregor is a rock star waiting to be. Nicole Kidman is beautiful, powerful, and a very nice singer.  The supporting cast is amazing.  There are so many wonderful costumes, sets, lights, colors, camera tricks, songs, musical manipulations, dances, and best of all, it all blends together into a WONDERFUL story! (reminiscent most of Dumas' ""Camille"", with even a reference to Camille's most famous portrayer, Sarah Bernhardt). It is nearly overwhelming at times, and it is so simple at times. Every element is blended together seamlessly to create a completely new form of the movie-musical. I would like to go into specifics, but I will exceed the 1,000 word limit far too quickly. I think anyone who enjoys love stories, musicals, operas, dance, or just a good film will appreciate this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
977,margonjinn,A twisted musical ride into the underworld of Paris 1899,10,26 January 2002,"This movie shocked me at first until I got into it. It really wasn't what I was expecting. I loved it and the music was phenomimal. Ewan McGregor is one of my favorites and I would watch him in anything. (Even Trainspotting) Satine is sexy and Christian is loveable. Their love is honest yet in a unhonest world. ""All you need is love."" I was really sad at the end.",Moulin Rouge!
978,wesn3586,Spectacular! Spectacular!,10,2 June 2001,"Most movies nowadays try to be as realistic as possible. And I began to ask, 'whatever happened to going to a movie, and you still know its a movie throughout the whole thing?' and with Moulin Rouge I did. It was a fantastic ride. The colors, the costumes, the story, was amazing. Sure, it was a simple love story, but it was huge. So many elements, drama, suspense, music, comedy, everything was in this film, and I left the theatre totally shocked. Baz Luhrman is simply a genius. This incredible idea he had, about the Moulin Rouge and integrating modern songs into it...brilliant! My vote's a ten. A wonderful movie experience, you won't soon forget.",Moulin Rouge!
979,bigguy728,My Favorite Movie!,10,17 March 2002,"Wow!  What a ""spectacular"" experience!  Ever since I first rented the movie two weeks ago, I have watched it seven times.  I was simply amazed at the heightened reality of the film.  While some think it is goofy, I thought it was great how the director, Baz Luhrman, could walk the viewer skillfully through such a wide variety of emotions- laughter, sadness, love, energy. The dance scenes, especially the tango scene, were truly a joy.  I love the way the play and the dance scenes mirror what is happening to Christian and Satine.  Also, casting was wonderful, and Nicole and Ewan's voices are perfect compliments.  Also, John Leguizamo played an excellent Toulouse-Latrec, and Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh were a wonderful support team.  The lighting was always perfect for each scene, and the use of color and movement, especially in the cancan dance, was simply magnificent.  I think the fact that we see all these exaggerated actions and emotions in the movie simply adds to the truth, not takes away from the reality (which is what many close minded people would say).  Furthermore, the use of previously composed songs did not bother me- in fact, it helped me relate to the movie more easily.  I have never been touched so much by a movie.  I give it a perfect 10!",Moulin Rouge!

I was pleasantly surprised at the singing talent of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  I recommend if you like music of any kind to go see this movie and then go buy the soundtrack (I did the following day...)... And I plan on seeing the movie again and then buying the video or DVD...",Moulin Rouge!
981,mstick,Visually spectacular,7,4 June 2001,"Well, this one really was an assault on the senses. Your eyes and ears will be overwhelmed, especially at the start of this well crafted tale.I enjoyed one of this director's previous works (Strictly Ballroom) and was underwhelmed by Romeo+Juliet, so went into this with a fairly open mind.
Quite frankly the story was ho-hum, but the outstanding performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor more than made up for it. Some will find the very 20th century soundtrack in this 1900-set film irritating, but I found it most amusing (especially the Elephant Love Medley and the fantastic rendition of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"")And a cameo by Kylie Minogue! How gorgeous!",Moulin Rouge!

983,HookEmDink,If Kurt Cobain could back from the dead...,3,5 June 2001,"...He would shoot himself in the head again. This movie was absolutely the worst product I've seen come from the movie industry in a long time. Sure, it's pretty to look at sometimes, but please - the script was weak, the songs were lame and corny, and the acting okay. The reason the critics and audiences have ""never seen anything like the Moulin Rouge"" is because they haven't set foot in a live theatrical venue. This was a poor excuse for a movie. Why not just put it on a REAL stage, and let it flop in a week (because it was so horrible),instead of waiting for a year or two for it to be adapted to the growing theme park we call Broadway? I am so disappointed in this film because I am a huge fan of Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Baz Luhrman. Save your money - watch the trailer. And whatever you do, don't waste your money on the soundtrack. Blah.",Moulin Rouge!
984,patria,"Stunning, exciting, romantic, what can one say?",10,6 June 2001,"I floated home on a romantic cloud, singing Elton John's ""This is my song"" and have been humming it to myself ever since (wish I knew the words).   I was stunned to discover that Nicole and Ewan were the actual singers of the songs.  Just amazing.   Ewan McGregor, pleasant those I've found him in the past, wasn't until now one of my favourite actors.  After this film, I fell completely in love with his depiction of a man in love.  He was so convincing and sincere - and gorgeous!  Nicole of course is always gorgeous; just didn't realise she could sing too. A whole new career for both of them!Baz Luhrmann has done it again.  ""Strictly Ballroom"" is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen and he's hit the target once more with Moulin Rouge.  I've recommended it everyone I know and even the male members of my family enjoyed the movie.   In fact, I can't wait to see it again and I don't often pay twice to revisit a film at the cinema (too expensive).   But this time, I'm dying to see the whole thing again (and probably again, and again - especially when it comes out on video!).  Congratulations, Baz, Nicole, Ewan and the whole cast!",Moulin Rouge!
985,patria,It gets better each time you see it,10,18 June 2001,"The first time I was dazzled and stunned and could hardly assimilate the movie.  The second time, I relaxed into it and couldn't hold back the tears - an emotional feast to the senses. A joy to behold.  A masterpiece.  I will certainly see it again and again and will even buy the soundtrack.
I have just spent some time reading through comments on this film. It certainly arouses deep feelings - from pure hate to pure ecstasy. Fortunately, mostly the latter.   I can only guess that those who hate this film so passionately are the same ones who would applaud such Hollywood dross as ""Pearl Harbour"".  And I wish Users would stop referring to this film as ""a Hollywood musical"". It was made in Australia by an Australian Director, with almost exclusively English and Australian stars!  When will the world wake up to the fact that some of the best on the screen - especially actors and actresses - comes from Down Under!",Moulin Rouge!
986,mcmlxxxviii,Warning: May cause seizures,5,19 December 2001,"The whole thing was interesting and irritating at the same time.  I enjoyed it enough not to stop the tape (I did take a break), but I really wanted it to end.  Strange mixes of music--rarely did you get more than a line or two from any single song--fast motion running around like those early Beatles movies.  I was just annoyed.A pretty good--if simple--story, though.",Moulin Rouge!
987,gvwilliamson,High energy and epic romance combine!,10,2 June 2001,"As ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" revolutionized the martial arts genre, director Baz Luhrman knew exactly what he was try to accomplish with ""Moulin Rouge"", and pull it off brilliantly and beautifully.   Moulin Rouge is a joy to take in from start to finish, and does for the musical genre what Crouching Tiger did for the martial arts, or maybe more-so. We open on Christian (McGregor), a young, and apparently haunted young poet, who immediately starts enlightening us with the story that  makes the movie. The opening scene in the Moulin Rouge is stunningly gorgeous and brilliantly smart, incorporating modern music in an earlier time period, with a large sequence including everything from Lady Marmalade, the hit single from the soundtrack, to a brilliantly operatic version of Smells like Teen Spirit by Nirvana. After the fun and the brilliance of this sequence subsides, the beautiful Nicole Kidman makes her sparkling entrance as the star of the Moulin Rouge with an exciting interpretation of the classic ""Diamonds"". Meanwhile, Christian is present take sin this event, after being asked to attend by aspiring playmakers (who happened to meet him by hilarious circumstances), trying to convince him to write their play, while getting Statine (Kidman) to star in it. As this event takes place, Satine wrongly mistakes Christian for the Duke, one of her ""costumers"", and takes him home with her, under the impression that he is interested in doing a little more than a poetry reading. But while Satine and Christian converse (and a little more) they immediately fall in love, and perform a sequence incorporating Blondie, The Wallflowers, and more. Things do not, however, go as planned when the Duke decides he wants Satine for himself, and Satine makes a discovery that will influence both her, Christian, and the Moulin Rouge's existence forever. With dazzling musical numbers, brilliant directing, and wonderful performances by both the two leads (who, by the way, sing their hearts out) and the delightful ensemble cast, mixed with modern hits and classics, this film gaurantees to become a classic. Moulin Rouge could easily start a chain of modern musicals, being appealing to the teen audience, and the adult audience alike, who will enjoy recognizing the music that is sung, and be intrigued by the epic romance that the story provides. The director makes sure not to go overboard with the music and completely forget about the wonderful story that makes the movie. Instead of having pointless characters for comic relief, some of the music serves as that (especially the performance of Maddonna's Like a Virgin) while still maintaining the mood that the director wanted. Overall, Moulin Rouge is a must see for anybody who loves music, theatre, or, most of all, movies. Soon to become a classic, Moulin Rouge is the best movie this year, and quite possibly, one of the most in-genius and beautiful movies of all time.",Moulin Rouge!
988,noshit!,Not So Spectacular! Not So Spectacular!,6,16 July 2001,"This is one of those infuriating movies - like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - that are very good where they're good, and very bad where they're bad. It could have been a masterpiece (and hence, Oscar material) but alas!I'll tell you where Moulin Rouge hit the bull's eye, and where it missed the barn by a mile. First, the hits:1. The film began well. Much of the first half of the film is corny, but so what? Corniness by itself doesn't make a movie bad, and in this case, it worked, thanks in large part to Baz Luhrmann's directing.2. By far my favourite part of the movie is the scene in Satine's bedroom (called The Elephant) where she mistakes Christian the penniless writer (Ewan) for the wealthy Duke (Richard Roxburgh). Nicole Kidman as Satine EXCELS here, especially in her orgasmic throes (you'll know what I mean when you see it).3. The supporting cast was by and large very good, especially the Bohemian revolutionaries a.k.a. Ewan's fellow-actors in the play, Spectacular! Spectacular!4. The set was lush and the costumes were opulent, something you would expect to see in a Tim Burton movie.5. The pacing was excellent.So far we've been talking about the first half of the movie, for most of the merits of the movie seem to be found there.Now the misses.1. From the point where Christian the writer meets Satine the courtesan on the roof-top of The Elephant, the movie inexplicably goes downhill. From that point on, the songs lose their punch and the plot just meanders along. In one word, you're liable to be bored stiff, as I was.2. The movie is about Satine's desire to act in a play written by Christian called Spectacular! Spectacular! Yet when the play is finally staged near the end of the movie, we only catch snippets of it. I know the director didn't mean to make a musical, but having built up such incredible expectations among the movie-goers, we should at least have had the chance to watch a major portion of the play. I certainly would have edited out much of the draggy singing that cluttered the second half of the movie, and shown more of the play.3. Similarly, we didn't see enough of the can can. Since the Moulin Rouge was famous for this, we should have been treated to a more or less complete can can dance. Instead we got little flashes here and there which were more annoying and headache-inducing than entertaining. Recall the flashes of flamenco dancing in the John Woo debacle, Mission Impossible 2, and you'll know what I mean.4. The plot was moronically predictable. You could see the ending a mile away. Worse, it was boring.Some specifics now.Nicole Kidman acted very well, I must say, though I'm not a fan of hers. Ewan McGregor was quite good, especially at the end of the movie where Satine died in his arms - his wailing was the best I'd heard since Mel Gibson's in The Patriot. I liked Richard Roxburgh as the Duke. (By the way, Roxburgh is the actor in Mission Impossible 2 whose finger was cut off with the bad guy's cigar-cutter.) It was nice to see Roxburgh get a meatier role than what he had in MI:2 and that he could act as well in a tragicomedy as in an action movie. Jim Broadbent, as Harold Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge, was outstanding. I hope he gets nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars.And now the golden question: can the stars sing? Well, I thought Nicole had a pretty good singing voice. She sounded like Madonna, only better. Ewan sang a version of Elton John's My Song and sang it well. But that was the only song he sang well. The rest was just monotonous bellowing.Sadly the movie didn't come up with much original music. There were plenty of spoofs e.g. Madonna's Like A Virgin, but surely an expensive movie such as Moulin Rouge deserves some good original music.I read somewhere on IMDb.com that the Roxanne tango was the greatest thing in the movie. Well, my movie partner thought so too. But sorry, it just didn't grab me.Certainly not on a par with The Sound Of Music, I'd give ML 6 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!
989,dkozel,"Cheesy, Cheerless, Cacophonous Tedium",1,27 January 2002,"Had I not heard so many glowing reviews of this disaster, I would have turned off my DVD player about a third of the way through. I wish I had. The best parts of this mess were the ones I slept through.Elton John's ""Your Song"" now has assumed permanent ""DELETE"" status on my CD jukebox after suffering through its misuse in this piece of junk. This attempt to apply contemporary music to a bygone era was ill-conceived and ludicrous. The plot of this movie barely exists. The production numbers would be best suited for a revival of The Gong Show.Apparently, calling something a musical gives it a certain status among reviewers, because I can think of no other reason for the praise given to this piece of garbage.""Moulin Rouge"" has the same effect as a train that passes ten feet from your house in the middle of the night. At first, it startles you. Then it annoys you. Eventually, you get used to it and fall back asleep, feeling relieved when you wake up and it's no longer there.",Moulin Rouge!
990,krikripiiin,Sad love-story!,10,6 June 2006,"I loved it and I cried. Most of all because I love love stories like that, where the one of them dies in the end. Very original also but that doesn't matter as long as it's good. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman is excellent performers in the movie and a thing which makes the movie even more better is that it's a musical. Everybody who sing in the film is great singers especially the leading parts Ewan and Nicole. I'm very mad at my self because I didn't watch it in the theaters because a movie is always best when you watch it in the theater. I can highly recommend it so if you're a couple who need to know how love can end if you don't follow you're heart this is the perfect movie!",Moulin Rouge!

992,ghetrick,"Great Eye Candy, Fair Movie",6,9 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a frustrating movie for me.  There is so much there that is very good to excellent, but it is dragged down by a script that fails in all the wrong places.This movie is a treat for the eyes.  The sets are vibrant and original, bursting with light and energy.  The camera flies over them like an acrobat on his/her eighth espresso; jumping, spinning, and dancing to capture the frantic action.  The use of lighting, not just to illuminate, but to define structures and action is wonderful.  This movie is indeed set in a fairyland, albeit a corrupt one.The costumes are totally over the top.  Whoever designed and made them must have had a wonderful time.  They are a near perfect expression of the sophisticated and decadent world portrayed here, the 19th century equivalent of disco.Led by Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge, and John Leguizamo as Toulouse Lautrec, the cast turn in performances that are at the very least good.  Broadbent holds this movie together as the satyr-like Zidler, a man for whom no pleasure is to be denied.  Leguizamo takes his Lautrec to the edge of zaniness while keeping him border line believable. Nicole Kidman shines as Satine.  She goes from hardened prostitute to lover, capturing at least my heart along the way.  Ewan McGregor delivers a wonderful tragic performance as the man who's love transforms Satine. 
Unfortunately, all of this is fatally compromised by a script that is indecisive at all the wrong times.  It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, a love story, or a tragedy.  The result are scenes that inject laughs at all the wrong times, drop tear jerking moments into the action without motivation, and generally ruin what could have been a transcendent movie experience.  The use of existing songs is handled poorly, all to often taking lines from several songs to create a muddled and confusing whole. While there are exceptions to this (especially the Police's ""Roxanne""), this is the general rule.  I was also surprised to discover that cast members did their own singing, the lip synching was terrible.All of this is really too bad, because Moulin Rouge had the potential to be one of the great movie musicals of all time.  But it just doesn't make the grade.",Moulin Rouge!
993,Laura Brink,Surprisingly Fantastic,10,14 July 2001,"To begin, I had anticipated failure regarding ""Moulin Rouge"" before I knew the first thing about it.  Then, to completely transform my opinion of the film, a relative of mine went to see it, and returned with the surprising news that it was the greatest movie he'd seen all year, and he's no novice when it comes to the film industry.  He raved about it, to say the least, and said that it was most certainly Best Picture material; he gave it a definite 10 out of 10.  I was shocked, but then again my brother has always had an interesting view on movies.  So I figured WHAT THE HECK and decided to make the trek over to the movie theater and give it a shot.  I was astonished at what this unusual movie had to offer in multiple forms; pure entertainment, artistic ability, impeccably remarkable acting, etc.  Beyond these, the story accompanying ""Moulin Rouge"" was intense, and did not cease to keep me at my most interested and amazed.  From the romance to the music to the keys on Christian's typewriter clicking, this was definitely one of those unforgettable movies that I've rarely has the pleasure of seeing these days.  That's not to say that ""Moulin Rouge"" is old-fashioned.  On the contrary.  It is a delightful mix of both the old and the new.I personally give ""Moulin Rouge"" 9 out of 10, and encourage all who read this to go see it.  But do not delay, for it frankly will be worthless, pathetic and most likely a waste of time to view on video; you absolutely MUST see it in the theater.  All things considered, a great movie.",Moulin Rouge!
994,gareth3es,Perfect!! Awesome!! Incredible!!! Superb!!!,10,20 September 2001,"I was lucky this summer because I was in Australia and I could see this wonderful movie before it arrives in Spain, and I really became in love with it. I´m a big fan of musicals, and I could say this one is the best one I´ve ever seen. The performances of all the actors are great, Nicole Kidman surprised me, I couldn´t imagine she was such a great actress, and Ewan, with dark hair, does here one of his greatest jobs.I like that frenetic and non-ending rythym that takes all the film since its beginnings, it is perfect, all the songs, especially ""Come what may"", took my breath away, there´s no one day in which I don´t sing ""Come what may"". I fell in love with Nicole.A great digital cinematography wraps the film with an incredible colorful atmosphere. The script is great, the music, the choreographies,oh, I wish I was there!, I couldn´t imagine a movie as perfect as this one. It really reached my heart.The other team is very well cast, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, Richard Coxburg, Caroline O´Connor, they are all great, I couldn´t forget that story of the maharaja,with all that dancers that turned Nicole into a goddess (""she´s mine"") and the Big Elephant.There´s so many wonderful things in that movie that I could write lots of books. I´ll never forget Nicole on the top of the elephant singing ""I´ll fly away"", or Ewan singing ""your song"". They are not singers, but they are a couple of great voices apart from  their acting.  Fortunately great singers have collaborated in doing the wonderful soundtrack, Bono, David Bowie, Beck, Valeria,Fatboy Slim, Mya, etc .Their songs fits perfectly with that story, and the lyrics make it more credible than ever.But I insist in the script, is perfect, those lines like: ""I´m not a duke, I´m a writer!"" or ""Tell our story Christian, this will be the only way we´ll be together"" or ""Love is like oxygen"" surprised me, especially the second one, which brought deep emotions to my heart. I won´t forget the day I saw this movie. I don´t know if I´m in love with Satine or Nicole, I think with the two of them. I recommend this movie to all people who likes musicals, frenetic dance, deep stories, and above all, love. The greatest thing you´ll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return. Moulin Rouge is without doubts, my third favourite movie, and I´m very proud it is Australian,(I´m Australian) and not a Hollywood product as lots of people  think.",Moulin Rouge!

And it lived up to my expectations- the whirling costumes, all-over direction, and lively acting made it a classic. My loving it shows that even the new generation can appreciate this visionary achievement(last year's best film, by far, was CROUCHING TIGER,HIDDEN DRAGON). Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor did great, and their singing was prefect- they are both 'honest to goodness' stars. I also really liked Jim Broadbent as harry Zidler- his character was really funny and full of energy.

1000,dramasylum,Save Your Money,1,4 June 2001,"Ewan McGregor can surely sing!  However, even his incredible talent cannot save this nightmare.  After sifting through 45 minutes of disjointed pop remakes (after identifying the setting as 1900 Paris) and unusual camera angles, the viewer is finally rewarded with - gasp - a PLOT.  (that is, if you were one of the patrons who did not walk out by this point.  During the show I went to, 12 did.)  The plot seemed to have a lot of promise.  There are great acting performances in this film by both leads, but their love affair happens too quickly to ever be believable.  They literally sing a remake and poof, both are in love.  Nothing is surprising at this point. Maybe I missed the point of using pop music in a film about the Moulin Rouge, but it seemed to have no point whatsoever - other than, perhaps, reaching its target audience of young teens.  It would also have been nice, since the film identifies Toulouse-Latrec, to have made him less of a buffoon and perhaps have mentioned (more than a brief second introduction) that he was an artist.  If he could have been any buffoon, maybe he should have been someone without a world-renowned reputation.  But if you want to see pop glorified, this is your film.  You will not be disappointed by McGregor.",Moulin Rouge!

Yes, they knew how to get visual wows and glue together a patchwork plot with the emotional juice leached from the songs they stole, but in the end it's just a really well funded and filmed trip to the karaoke bar.It's not just that they recycled the songs in lieu of a script but they couldn't manage to remain true to the spirit, the lyric, or the tune of those songs, nor did they stick to one era or genre. It just seems to be a wholesale ragbag of anything that can goose the emotions of someone not thinking very hard.",Moulin Rouge!

Their stellar performances, especially that of Nicole Kidman, forced me to adopt this film as my favorite movie...ever. I have seen many, many movies, and very few have captured me the way Moulin Rouge did. Every aspect of the film, from acting, to singing, to costumes, to makeup, was done to near perfection. It brought music back to the big screen, and portrayed a love story of epic proportions. If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop wasting your time. I'm sorry I waited as long as I did.

I mean granted, I have to give credit where it is due,  The cinematography was different and grand, the singing of Ewen McGregor and Nicole Kidman was quality, however I felt that the Bastardization by Luhrman of the great Rock and Roll works probably made Freddy Mercury and Kurt Cobain roll over in their graves.  I really felt that the predictable plot and the campy dance routines made me want to laugh in a bad way more than praise the movie.  If this is the type of movie that people believe is brilliant, I believe that a new Paulie Shore movie is coming out for you intellectuals.  After seeing this movie, I have lost all respect for Baz Luhrmann's ""artwork"".

I was ""knocked out"" by its humor, clever use of music and even using lyrics occasionally as spoken dialogue. It was visually stunning.  It was well cast, and the performances were very impressive.  To those who complain that Ewan MacGregor lent all the real emotion to the story, may I point out what should be obvious because it's inherent to the script...there is meant to be a big difference between the two characters...a wide-eyed, innocent, romantic poet should seem more emotional than a jaded, worldly courtesan.  And it is written from Ewan's character's viewpoint.  Nicole expressed her character's emotions very believably, and she was funny in the humorous moments.  I hope she chooses comedies more often than she has so far in her career.  And finally, for the ""Like A Virgin"" number alone, this film was fun!",Moulin Rouge!

1011,mgoodro,Delightful musical storytelling strung together by theatrical silliness,8,15 January 2002,"While amazing by stage standards I had mixed feelings at the onset of this rendition. Though starting with a clever opening this film quickly finds itself mired in silliness and visual cacophony. What has been repeatedly described as production brilliance seemed at first a garish mess of opulent design and flashy costume only suited for a vaudeville production. However, the opening sequences do serve to set the stage, as it were, for the rest of the film. The music is where the real magic begins.  At the onset of the first duet with Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman I was hooked for the duration. The music of this piece is clever and inventive while being almost wholly unoriginal at the same time. The songwriters have tapped into some 50 years of pop songs about `Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all, Love' and woven them together in powerful, evocative fashion in many cases transcending the original versions. In similar fashion to Dancer in the Dark (though no further comparison applies), the film is at its most pleasurable peak during the musical numbers.",Moulin Rouge!

My first question is, if most of the lines are sung, why did they choose two actors who cannot sing? and fine, if you want famous stars, why couldn't you at least dub their singing lines so that the audience doesn't have to suffer through shrill screeches for two hours.  the plot is cliched and i cannot believe that they were allowed to butcher those popular songs!! the set was overdone, everyone was overacting, and the script was lame so that the end result was a pathetic, shrill, superficial clownshow.  that this movie was ever made is an embarrassment, that it is up for any awards is a sin, and that people actually enjoyed it is baffling. can't even vote on this movie until IMDB allows negative numbers.",Moulin Rouge!
1016,washsem2001,Like a virgin...Hey!,2,17 March 2002,"Bialystock and Bloom themselves couldn't have come up with a better formula for a bad movie. Rip off an old musical (""Cabaret""), set it in the past, and force your characters to spend the entire movie singing bad 80's pop songs. Wait--not bad enough. Let there only be about four or five bad 80's pop songs, and force your characters to sing each one for a half an hour straight, until no one who watches the movie can ever hear the songs again without being traumatized all over again. Get some real A-list, truly great actors, and run their careers into the ground by forcing them to dress in tablecloths and prance around serenading random passersby. Then edit it all so that it's completely incomprehensible and impossible to understand.
That's a pretty good formula for a bad movie. And the fact that ""Moulin Rouge"" is now nominated for eight Oscars and is well entrenched on the top 250 list only goes to prove that Mel Brooks was even more visionary than we thought. ""Moulin Rouge"" is the real world's ""Springtime for Hitler.""Where did ""Moulin Rouge"" go right? I haven't the faintest idea. I sat there for two hours watching this thing, knowing that so many people loved it--I just assumed it would get better after a while. But it just kept getting worse.This really is a love-it-or-hate-it movie. I don't think there's any middle ground. And I think it really depends on what you think of the use of modern pop songs in a movie set in 1900. Apparently Luhrmann justified it as necessary to convey the idea that Ewan McGregor's character was writing lyrics that transcended time and spoke to the true nature of love (or something along those lines). Even if that's true, that still doesn't justify the ""Like A Virgin"" sequence. Or ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" for that matter. Or ""The Sound Of Music."" And if I ever thought ""Your Song"" transcended time and spoke to the true nature of love, I certainly don't now, after having to endure McGregor and Kidman first singing the lyrics, then speaking the lyrics to each other, then speaking the lyrics to other people, then singing them again, then singing them again later...I like Elton John, but that went on for a half an hour. (Interrupted, that is, by another song that was ""So a-nnoy-ing! I can't clear it from my head! So a-nnoy-ing! It will stay there till I'm dead!"")So, in conclusion, I hated this movie. I gave it a 2/10 on the strength of the acting, which at least is very good. The fact that Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent are at least watchable in this movie is a testament to their respective greatnesses as actors. If Kidman wins Best Actress, I won't be too upset. (If it wins any other Oscars at all, I will break my television with a hammer.)Warning to all: if you're watching this movie for the first time, and you get to the part (about five or ten minutes in) where Ewan McGregor belts out ""The hills are alive with the sound of music,"" and you find yourself really hoping the rest of the movie isn't going to be like this, shut--it--off. It will not get better. If you're still tolerating it at that point, keep watching. You'll love it.",Moulin Rouge!
1017,mrpancake_2000,On second thought...,2,26 May 2003,"I really, truly loved this movie when I originally saw it.  I saw it twice in the theaters, and both times it was a really unforgettable cinematic experience.  However, upon seeing this movie again, it is just, in my opinion, a little overdone.  Personally, I think it would have been much more tolerable if it had been cut a considerable amount of time, but the love story gets very ...meh...to me.  Although many wont agree, Nicole Kidman is, at best, and overrated actress.  Ewan is a little better, but I don't see the ""wow"" factor everyone else sees.  His voice is certainly better than Nicole's.  I think the cinematography and direction is really good, but I just think this movie doesn't have quite the power to make me want to watch it multiple times.  There can be too much of a good thing. I'm giving it a 2, to even out the 10 I gave it before I discovered it, well, annoyed me.  What bothers me most is when people assume it started a musical revival that paved the way for Chicago.  Not true.  It isn't as if Chicago wasn't going to be made before Moulin Rouge came out.  It was like 20 years in the making.  Chicago was better because it keeps at a good length, with a great storyline and better acting and voices.",Moulin Rouge!

The music was simply fabulous, how they mixed different songs and made it sound fantastic. Also with an unbelievable story line and a strong cast, this movie was clearly a box office smash hit. I know that many others, myself included, fell in love with this movie the very moment it ended. It's hard not to get lost in the atmosphere this film creates, with all the romance, comedy, and the tragical moments. The casting couldn't have been picked better,They just did such a great job in making this film.Moulin Rouge! is about a song writer named Christian, played by heartthrob Ewan McGregor, who poses as a professional bohemian play writer for the show ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" which Satine, played by the stunning Nicole Kidman, stars in as the lead Broadway actress. The two develop passionate love for one another but know that their romance is forbidden for Satine is supposed to seduce and be-wed the jealous Duke who will grant her wish to becoming a real actress.I voted this movie 10/10 but honestly my original vote broke the rating scale.",Moulin Rouge!

The emotion didn't really seem to capture me and I didn't like many of their musical selections.  How can they use Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit?

1023,triade1,When art and cinema becomes one,8,30 December 2015,"An example of a film based on a book, which since its origin blends various art forms to tell the unhappy life and the ephemeral loves with dancers and models of Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, the painter of the late nineteenth century that a childhood accident had rendered deformed. The plot therefore should be loneliness and alcohol. But art is transfiguration, and that is where the masterpiece was born. So entertainment is, and entertainment at its best! Imagination and originality in a movie that breaks down the barriers of space and time: the life goes on the stage and merges with the art, the rock songs of the last thirty years bend to the whim of the characters giving voice to their passions. Music, simply used as a means of narrative, out of time and out of context, but for this reason even more powerful, is put at the service of art ... art, in turn, which, with the magnificence of the scenes and the extreme colors of the characters, surprises and strikes deep with his message of love, perhaps a bit Utopian compared to the gray cynicism of these days...

This movie was terrible, hands down. I usually enjoy musicals, but instead of 'reawakening' America's interest in musicals, I know this movie made me do a complete 180. In my life, I have always watched a movie in one sitting, but I could only take Moulin Rouge in small doses of about twenty minutes, or I think my head might of exploded. I'm sorry, but I have respect for songs like ""All you Need is Love"" and ""Smells like Teen Spirit,"" (and if you don't, then you need to get with it),I mean, their great songs. But this movie's remakes of them, were incredibly dissapointing, and bordering with blasphemy.My ratings (out of 10): Characters, 1. Acting, 4(I think Kidmen should have one for best actress, she plays a convincing prostitute...). Plot, 4(there was one, so that gives it some credit). Music, -6. Satisfaction, 0. Enjoyment, 0.

Wow, I was shocked at how utterly awful this title was.  Good thing that I work at a theater and get movies for free, or I would've completely wasted my eight bucks on this one.  The scene where the drugs enter the characters' systems near the beginning started the long, lost, winding road of a movie.  Just one more side note, Ewan McGregor needs to sit out of the movie business for a few years and rethink his character choices, because after this and those jokes of a movie they call Star Wars, he's flushing his career down the toilet.1 out of 10",Moulin Rouge!

I came with very high hopes for this one, as many say it was the reason for Chicago's success. I have to say, it is a very foreseeable movie, the story is a classical Hollywood soap-opera, and music and dancing are really just for ""decoration"": The focus is always on story (the final play says it all). Unfortunately, the story didn't catch, and I wasn't touched by it a single moment.The music is not bad, if you like to recognize famous songs played a bit different. Even so, I couldn't find a single song that stayed with me, and most of them are cut to less than a minute! As I said, the focus is really on the story, which is bad enough to spoil even the rare moments of good music.Anyway, the dancing is really missing, and it could have been so much better! Except for the tango scene (which is not great, but I suppose it's the best scene in the entire movie: you should see Asfalt Tango for a much better one), I always had a feeling of frustration, trying to see the dance and moves, but the cutting and camera moves didn't allow.I think the greatest achievement of this movie is turning the attention of the audience towards musicals, and making possible the success of later movies, like Chicago. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would give 7.",Moulin Rouge!

1029,jesper-224,Annoying,1,31 January 2009,"I think this film is absolutely annoying. Why are we living in an age where every wannabe-actor is suddenly a great singer and performer. So far until date, Nicole Kidman's only good performances has been exposing her body either naked or in tight or see-through costumes (in her youth) on camera and Ewan McGregor is a very handsome man but not a deep feeling character actor. Good for Star-Wars, The Island and other action packed no-brainers.So, in this movie you are not seeing the young, hot Nicole and you are forced to witness Ewan as a deep wanna-be bourgeois poet-type which comes out rather annoying.They have taken hits from the last 20-30 years and over-stuffed the movie with them for the hope of recognition appeal, however, hearing every song from my youth spoiled by never-ending sustains in a less-then-flattering 'opera-style' just made me feel more and more annoyed.The plot of the movie would last around 5 minutes if they didn't have the lingering tones (forever) to make the 2 hours.I like being reminded of older songs in a modern way, but I would rather hear Christina Aguilera sing 'Lady Marmalade' 10 times than watch this movie again.",Moulin Rouge!

After the first hour...the writing but dragged on...and on...and on....the elephant meledy is stunning...but after that musical numbers like ""Like a Virgin"" and ""Roxanne"" are horrible....the acting isn't much either except for Nicole Kidman who carries the film..I much preferred her role in the The Others..the writing is terribly predictable and nothing special either...Baz Luhrman tried to do something unique and artistic...all I got out of it was a headache....Moulin Rouge is one of those movies you either love or hate....I just think its a movie using pop songs and hot stars to get box-office bucks........",Moulin Rouge!

Reluctantly i watched it, and suddenly changed my mind very quickly.  I've always liked the two main actors(Kidman and Mcgregor) and they played their part wonderfully, and have awsome singing voices as well.

Though many people criticize this movies use of popular 'main-stream' music, I found it to be very interesting - and a bit different from 'the norm' - Not to mention comical at times!... The actors did a wonderful job with all the singing - (though am a bit biased on this subject as I know that I could probably never do something like that!)2.) The Storyline was good. Maybe a bit predictable at times (with the all-too-tragic ending...) But still very well done. Well written!3.) Visually appealing and stimulating. I consider this to be a very important quality in any film and 'Moulin Rouge!' with its vivid colors, CGI backgrounds and scenery, and authentic costumes and get ups certainly earned 'kudos' in my book...4.) Superb acting. ALL the actors in this film did a splendid job...Nicole Kidman - very stunning (as always) gave her charater an added spark that kept you interested... I can't really imagine anyone else in this role - she pulled it off so perfectly! Ewan McGreggor - Gorgeous (again, as always) I just LOVE his voice! I really liked his character - very endearing... John Leguizamo (please forgive any misspellings!) superb as Touluse! His character made me laugh SO MUCH!!! Okay, as you may have noticed I'm running out of adjectives to describe this awesome cast - So I think I'll just stop at that!5.) As I mentioned already the characters were just so rich and endearing - deffinitely a fact worth reiterating!6.) And last, but certainly not least, LOVE. This is such a 'hopeless romantic' movie (yes, if you're wondering, I am one!) with the whole ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return"" thing resonating through the entire film - how could it not be?...So, as you can see, I highly rate this movie - it will forever be one of my favorites.

I am amazed because this movie is quite extreme, in that the actors are actually singing, and the most weird things keep happening, but still it is a well told story. You can see that this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but other moments are very real and serious, and I think they work extra well because of this contrast.

1041,JulietsDagger,The good and the bad of Moulin Rouge!,8,26 August 2004,"Moulin Rouge! (2001) Directed by Baz Luhrmann, With Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and Jim Broadbent.THE PLOT: A young poet named Christian (Ewan McGregor) comes to France to write a novel, and by a strange turn of events ends up coming to the Moulin Rouge to start a play. While at the Moulin Rouge, Christian falls deeply in love with a beautiful, but ill courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman).THE GOOD: Now, you probably shouldn't follow reviewers guidelines for this movie. It is a love it or hate it type, and you just have to decide for yourself whether you like it or not. As for me, I really enjoyed it. I thought the costumes and sets were all grand and beautiful. The acting is great, in my opinion. Everyone in the cast really surprised me with their singing abilities. Unlike other movies that would involve the themes in this film (by themes I am talking about sex and prostitutes), the movie does not end up feeling tasteless and tacky. If you're not a fan of Baz's typical fast-paced direction, don't give up within the first twenty minutes. It gets better after the beginning.THE BAD: Like I mentioned before, this is a love it or hate it type so I didn't find much bad within the film. If you can't stand musicals or the fact that the music is not original, steer clear of this movie. The soundtrack includes many popular songs from recent decades. The stars of the film sing them all so don't expect to be hearing the original versions of any of the songs used. **POTENTIAL SPOILER** If you dislike sad endings, this might not be the movie for you. **SPOILER OVER**MY RATING: 8/10",Moulin Rouge!

It made the movie's beat so vibrant and wild with energy.When I first saw the movie I was bewildered and a little insulted but I out grew it. The movie is a little odd but it is also magical.

Basically, this story is about four things: Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and above all things, LOVE! The movie is packed with some music such as ""Lady Mamalade"" (sung by Christina Aguilera, Mya, Missy Elliot, Pink, & Lil Kim), ""Nature Boy"" (written by David Bowie), ""Your Song"" (written by Elton John), and many more so exciting and so delighting songs that we may be familiar of.

I am especially impressed by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's acting. Boy, they both can sing too! Nicole (Bewitched, The Interpreter) portrays Satine, a beautiful courtesan of a French night club in Paris. Ewan (The Island, Down With Love) portrays Christian, a young struggling writer who falls in love with her after she unwittingly draws him into her seductive spell with her sexual powers. Their secret affair leads them to explosive consequences. I have always loved Ewan and Nicole's work and this is what I have got to say to them, ""Ewan & Nicole, you're doing great!

1049,john-3142,A Crime Against Humanity,1,14 January 2006,"After seeing this film, I feel ashamed of the human race. I feel even more ashamed when I see how many people actually enjoyed it. One of the worst things about a film like this is that after watching it, you may never again be able to speak to people you know that did like it.This film is nothing short of a crime against humanity. Not only are the characters utterly undeveloped, there is no plot (I repeat, there is absolutely no plot), it is an utter failure as a musical. The majority of the musical pieces are bastardised versions of contemporary pop (eg Smells Like Teen Spirit - so pretentious, it makes Tony Blair look genuine) and the original pieces are as nauseating as medium rare chicken breast sandwich.The director might as well just have filmed himself masturbating. That goes for the rest of the crew, cast and production team.I would rather mate with some fevered Turkish wild fowl than watch this travesty again.",Moulin Rouge!
1050,NiJu,Post-modern cinematic orgasm.,7,23 May 2001,"(May technically contain spoilers) I should preface this review with saying I had a really bad feeling that this film was really going to suck. I had hoped it would live up to the hype, but as so often happens with Hollywood hype, films fall flat on their own false reputation.  Baz Luhrmann's film ""Moulin Rouge"" far exceeded any expectations I had, negative or positive, and was a truly magical and beautiful cinematic experience. While most filmmakers agree that at a fundamental level, films should be in some way about the human condition, there is always a drive to create, innovate and impress.  All too often films try too hard to do one or the other to extremes, but once in a while a film comes along and does them both, splendidly. ""Moulin Rouge"" is one such film. The story in ""Moulin Rouge"" takes the tried and true narrative path of the innocent love story, between the coveted and gorgeous courtesan, 'Satine' (Nicole Kidman) and young naive writer 'Christian' (Ewan Macgregor). The plot centers on these two characters' struggle to practice their love, which is forbidden for a variety of reasons.  The most pressing obstacle to their love is the 'evil' (read: classic slimey Hollywood bad guy character) Duke of Monroth, played hilariously by the talented Richard Roxburgh.  Without giving too much of the story away, the Duke's character puts the young lovers in a decidedly tough position and ultimately puts their love to the test. Cinematically, ""Moulin Rouge"" is a feast for the eyes, as well as the ears.  Yes it can be campy. Yes it can be over the top. Is that a problem? If you are a cynic who can't handle too much colour (and I have to tell you I thought I was) or honestly believe in nothing but stark realism in cinema, then this film is probably not for you. To those of you with an open mind, this film is a gorgeous rainbow for the eyes and ears.The soundtrack. Where to begin?  A postmodern extravaganza of lovesong lyrics well weaved into traditional orchestral songs, as well as ultra modern thumping electronica... Luhrman (who was the album producer) has done to the musical what hiphop did to the humble sampler. (Who said you can only sample recorded audio? Why not lyrics and score as well?)..  Again I don't want to give anything away, but think of all the many cheesy love songs of the last twenty years compressed into a couple of all-encompassing big band musical scores in the most tastefully kitsch and gorgeously wonderful way. This film oozes post modern cred. :) As for the performances themselves - it was great to see that non-musicians were chosen to lead, as well as sing. They (Kidman, Macgregor) have good voices, but they don't have the heavily over-trained voices of a singer. In my humble opinion this makes the soundtrack so much more honest, which is so important for a love story like this.  They don't sound like pop stars, they sound like your friend or neighbour who has a nice voice (maybe they even sound like you)... Technically. Well all I can say is as an Australian in the film industry I often wondered why it took Hollywood so long to work out we always had the skills (I guess now we have the currency that will soon come in bundles ;P ), but anyway the special effects and studio wizardry in this film is what the world has come to expect from films out of Fox in Sydney, so no surprises there. And the only minor quibble I had?  The music was wonderful. BUT (and I strongly believe it was just the theater I was in - a preview screening with most patrons just thankful to be there), the mixes on the songs, while on the whole very good, at the worst of times did not really seem (technically, mixing) designed for a cinema space. For the most part they were rich and sonically dynamic, but on one or two tracks I felt the audience was a bit dissapointed at how the location audio was pushed right forward at the expense of bassy thumpin' tracks. Nonetheless, the quality was excellent, despite the concerned head scratching of one or two patrons in the theater I was in. Cinema audiences these days, I ask you. ;)  It's not enough that a film like ""Moulin Rouge"" blows their mind and their preconceptions, they need the bass cranked and for it to shake them out of their seats. The on screen love between Satine and Christian was enough for me.  Go watch this film, and please do as I did and keep an open mind and heart, you will not be dissapointed.",Moulin Rouge!
1051,Tyler Szabo,No Laws. No Limits. One Rule. See This Movie and You Will Fall In Love.,10,20 January 2002,"The first time I saw the film, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.  I came away not really sure what the colorful, unique, fast-paced piece of art was really all about.  I liked it, but I didn't know why.  But this is not a shortcoming of the film, but probably its greatest strength: it makes you watch it again.and again...and again until you cannot stop.Moulin Rouge creates its own genre: a mixture of a musical, a comedy, a romance, a drama, and a tragedy.  It is also a mixture of a film, a play, and a dance show.  It takes the best from each of these genres and each of these art mediums to create an unforgettable classic.  Baz Luhrmann has succeeded in creating a world that you can escape to, be entertained by, be moved by, and never want to leave.Although many of the songs in the film are not original, the film transforms popular songs into ""Moulin Rouge"" music.  The songs fit seamlessly into the story and are sung and danced to with such talent, that soon the film version of the song may become your favorite.  The music is simply exceptional.  The soundtrack, unfortunately, does not take many of the best songs from the film and, in fact, only one of the songs on the soundtrack is exactly how it appears in the film.Besides the music, the other strongest asset of the film is the acting. Each actor/actress creates such an indelible and developed character that it will be difficult to accept the actors/actresses playing roles in any other film.  For example, Ewan McGregor seemed totally out of place in Black Hawk Down, his next feature film, playing a soldier (with a virtually shaved head) in the U.S. Army.  Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, and Richard Roxburgh tie the choppy scenes of the film together and all deserve awards.  The surprisingly good singing by Kidman, McGregor, and Broadbent, who provide their own voices for their songs, define their characters.What truly makes the film a classic is that you can go to any scene in the film and be both entertained and moved.  Every scene is done with such style, such phenomenal acting, and often performed to stunning music and dance, that this film has a timeless quality.Besides being entertaining, what makes a film a truly great and unforgettable film is if it has meaning.  From beginning to end, Moulin Rouge is about ""Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all Love.""  Moulin Rouge is in fact a fairy tale, and like all classic fairy tales, its purpose is not only to transport you into another world, but also to leave you with a new meaning about your own world.  ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.""So, remember, watch Moulin Rouge open-minded, and then see it again and again and again...10/10 -- One of the best films, one of the best musicals, and one of the best love stories ever.",Moulin Rouge!
1052,mrb-2,One Long Music Video,4,30 December 2001,"I like musicals but not this one. If it had been made a short music video, it would have been right up there as a good one. The story was weak, the acting not much better, only the choice of music saved it.Not good.",Moulin Rouge!
1053,frery,We'll quote this film in the future,9,21 September 2001,"The film takes video clip language to its limits, producing a visual orgy. The story is simple and well known, but who cares? I even think that a weak plot is a great idea when form and aesthetics should prevail. I am sure this movie will establish a borderline, and we will talk about ""before and after Moulin Rouge"". The film is not a mere MTV long clip, it is much more than that. The music is quite nice, specially for those older than 30.",Moulin Rouge!
1054,Joe-258,It's allegorical,9,21 March 2002,"In the first 15 minutes, my senses were assaulted.  I was also taken aback by the use of popular song lyrics as dialogue.  Then I finally got the point of the movie. It's not even remotely grounded in reality.  It's ""hyper-real"" (Lurhman's own words).  It's allegorical. The characters are deliberately archetypal.Relax, and give in to this feast for the senses, and you won't be disappointed.McGregor's ability to sing surprised me more than Kidman's.  Personally, I think he did a better job singing, but both were quite good!Roxburgh's portrayal of the Duke is superbly comical.  When he recites a couple of lines from ""Like a Virgin"", I was rolling on the floor.  Compare this with his character in MI2.  They are a wonderful contrast.My favorite part is when the song, ""Roxanne,"" is given an awesome interpretation in some passionate Argentine Tango.The key is that the songs and lyrics-as-dialogue are wonderfully integrated into the movie, unlike a standard musical that stops for a song.  This integration contributes to the film's good pacing.  It's so refreshing to see popular songs used in original ways.",Moulin Rouge!
1055,sundae,Insanely beautiful modern opera,10,5 July 2001,"Moulin Rouge tells the story of Christian (McGregor), an innocent young poet who defies his father and moves to late nineteenth century Paris to live a penniless bohemian life, and winds up falling in love with Satine (Kidman), the ""Sparkling Diamond"" of the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub. Satine, who is dying of tuberculosis but doesn't know it, dives into an ill-fated relationship with Christian, despite the only rule of the Moulin Rouge: never to fall in love. The storyline is cliche, but it is told in such a unique way that you feel as if you're being told a love story for the very first time.Everything about this film is beautiful. The visuals are even more outlandish and artistic than those of Baz Luhrmann's last film, William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, but they seem to work even better for this film. The scenes cut so often and are so mixed up that the movie could have easily been a mess, but Luhrmann somehow managed to put them all together perfectly.The music is also wonderful. I have always had a soft spot for film musicals, and it's refreshing to know that they haven't gone completely extinct. The music is also fun because it's mostly made up of contemporary pop songs, featuring such artists as Sting and Elton John, as well as a few classics like ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" and ""The Sound of Music."" It's amazing how well the songs fit; it almost seems as if they were written for the movie.The acting is astounding. Nicole Kidman is wonderful, and has a surprisingly good voice (yes, it is her singing). And Ewan McGregor is indescribably amazing! He is immensely talented as an actor and has a beautiful voice. He really has a talent for making the audience feel the intense emotions that pour out of his character. Richard Roxburgh, Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo, who play the Duke, Zidler, and Toulouse Lautrec respectively are all very entertaining, providing the comic relief. All of the actors portray their characters in a very exaggerated, melodramatic and operatic way, which confirms the fact that this film is a modern opera.This movie swept me off my feet. Everything about it is perfect; I wouldn't change a thing. When it came to the end of the movie, it felt to me like waking up from a wonderful dream, wishing it could have lasted forever. But it is obviously the type of movie where you either love it or you hate it, because it's so unique. If you tend to go for simple movies, or movies with a diverse, constantly twisting plot (not that I don't love that genre), you probably won't see much in this movie. But if you like original, artistic, intensely dramatic films, this is one you don't want to miss.",Moulin Rouge!
1056,barney19,like a kid fuelled by red cordial...,4,3 June 2001,"The first half of this film is a fun, frenetic romp full of hilarious dialogue and cheekiness. This shall be known as 'the good bit'. Then comes the second half. And just like a kid fuelled on red cordial, the buzz ends sooner than you want to, and with Moulin Rouge, crikey did it end. Unfortunately, the buzz ended exactly at the halfway mark. This shall be known as 'the bad bit.' From that moment on, this is some of the most boring film-making in the history of the world. The good bit -- with Ewan in fine form, Nicole doing a lovely job pretending to sing and the cast so brim full of energy you could power a small town on their vibrations -- neatly glosses over the absolute lack of story. Well, the thinnest story imaginable. But as a chorus of suited blokes would sing, ""it's not about the story, it's about love and clever use of modern songs in a turn-of-the-century setting"". How much that matters is up to you. The comes the bad bit. When the film comes to a grinding halt in the middle, the bit when it decides to try and be a real movie and less of an experience, this is when you should stick knitting needles in your eyes. The life, soul and spirit is sucked out of proceedings harder than something I can't write here but involves one of the many prostitutes in the film. A shame. Moulin Rouge is a red-hot go at a musical, but realises midway through proceedings that it just can't go on, when in fact it should have.",Moulin Rouge!
1057,Stupid-7,An Operatic Spectacular on Screen,9,13 September 2001,"Having seen this film last night, I still cant get over how good this was.It quite clearly owes more to stage Opera than stage musical, and that is possibly why people feel that it is a disorganised mess with limited plot.Opera plots are very similar to this, with twists and turns complicating simple love stories.The handling of the songs is also much more Operatic, with two people singing different songs at each other, musical refrains occurring and re-occurring throughout.The Roxanne song and dance number was awesome, Ewan McGregor and Jacek Koman singing the same song in very differing styles, whilst Nicole Kidman sings the recurring love theme song.A great film, the style of which will be lost on those who are expecting a musical, when what they get is closer to Opera.  A style in which this day and age is ignored by the average movie-goer.Baz Luhrmann has truly opened up a new genre in film with this excellent masterpiece, you would be a fool to miss it, whether you feel it will be your cup of tea or not.",Moulin Rouge!

For years it was the trend movies (ie-the disaster movies, WW2 movies, destroying earth movies).  Now we have this glimmering light from the depths of Hollywood shining through all the proverbial muck.  I can't say much more about this movie without talking about the story and plot.  But I can say that I was making plans to see it again less than half way through the movie.  And it doesn't hurt that the music is wonderful.  McGregor and Kidman are incredible together, and they have the most wonderful voices.  I recommend this movie to any person of any age, and especially to those of a theatre background.",Moulin Rouge!

It gets to all the points that a real story would make but it earns none of them.Are we really supposed to find the lyrics to ""The Sound of Music,"" ""Smels Like Teen Spirit"" and/or Elton John's ""Your Song"" compelling and/or meaningful?  Or is this some really subtle joke that went over my head?  It would be more forgiveable if we found out that the filmmakers were stoned the whole time.Until my fading memory returns, I'd have to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen.",Moulin Rouge!
1060,Baimudan,Fantastic.,10,12 March 2003,Shockingly good to the point of amazing. I have to admit I almost missed this movie.

1061,tobyp,Best since American Beauty and in some ways better,10,14 September 2001,"All good films have to be good on at least one level.Gladiator was an epic, American Beauty ironic, Priscilla Queen of the Desert kooky, Delicatessan original, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon beautiful, Kes sad, Chocolat romantic and Shrek plain funny.Moulin Rouge manages to be all of these at the same time(maybe not an epic!). The scenery and characterisations are enchanting, the notion of displacing music could have been disasterous, but worked out just fine. In fact, it was what Topsy Turvy should have been (Jim Broadbent please note).It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but after the nightmare of New York this week, Moulin Rouge was a terrific piece of escapism in the grand manner. 10 out of 10 without hesitation.

I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for quite awhile.Moulin Rouge! could have been a truly great movie if someone would have held Baz Luhrmann's hand and restrained him a bit.  Unfortunately, the film suffered from many of the shortcomings of Romeo and Juliet, but this time they were amplified beyond all reason.  Baz Luhrmann's editing, while innovative, is nothing short of self-indulgent.  It takes over the film, interrupts the story, and turns the film into a mediocre overly-long music video.I don't fault any of the performances...not even the singing.  The story was actually pretty good...when it was allowed to unfold.  Had the film-makers exercised some self-control in the editing room, this movie could have easily taken place inside of one hour.  It also could have been a very good movie.  Luhrmann is a visual genius, but he needs to be reined in a bit.",Moulin Rouge!
1067,jpmurmur,It tries REALLY hard,1,25 June 2003,I'll just list the problems with the film:I doubt a woman in the advanced stages of tuberculosis could have been singing like Satine was.  It's like asking me to believe that a paraplegic could perform Riverdance.The editing was arbitrary and distracting.There was absolutely NO chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. It felt like I was watching a brother and sister kiss.The film could have been improved immensely had they used original music. What a horrible idea.Now what was good:I did enjoy the costumes and the beautiful sets.,Moulin Rouge!

Nothing wrong with that however to cast around her average singing talent with  Ewan McGregor,a fine actor but a terrible singer makes this film;and only then sightly, easier to watch sans sound. Second,I love a roller coaster ride however lets don't change the mood of a scene even before the song has ended. It loses alot in the emotion of the film when you aren't able to properly feel the mood before it changes again. The entire movie did have a very rushed feeling to it. I did, however find John Leguizamo portrayal of Toulouse Lautrec very enjoyable. Just my opinion.",Moulin Rouge!

It elicits so many different emotions.The use of modern day pop songs laced throughout added greatly to the entertainment and thats what is was- great entertainment. The special effects and the larger than life characters wove a fascinating web that engulfed you and before I knew it, it was over.That is the mark of a good film when it only seems like it started and its finished.I, along with the whole of the male population must have fallen in love with Nicole, Tom's loss is our gain.  The chemistry between her and Ewen was so hot it burnt an acid stain in my brain. I watched it pay for view and at this rate I could be bankrupt by Christmas.Enjoy !",Moulin Rouge!

I can understand why some may not like this film, but for anyone who is well educated in the art of filmmaking, surely Moulin Rouge rates highly in terms of ingenuity.Every scene knocked me off my feet. I saw this film with a group of fellow film students, and every single one of us thought it was fantastic, astounding, hilarious, moving. The ""El Tango De Roxanne"" sequence was simply amazing, really powerful stuff! And who knew of the enchanting vocal talents McGregor and Kidman possess?10 out of 10. I cannot believe it didn't get a look in at Cannes. Just shows how stuffy and conservative the industry is getting.

Basicaly, it starts out with a young writer, Christian (played to perfection by the addorable Ewan McGregor), moves to Paris in 1899. He quickly gets invovled in a group of actors, with the lovable John Leguizamo playing Toulouse Lautrec. He then quickly finds himself quickly into the Moulin Rogue and meets Satine, played by Nicole Kidman. Which results in a hilarous first meeting, she finds that he is not the Duke that she is suppose to be ""impressing"". This quickly leaves to a passionate secret love affair between Christian and Satine, behind the Duke's, who is also taken by Satine and wants her to himself, back. But little to any of them know, is that Satine is slowly dieing.
I've been waiting for years for a good musical to come along, and it looks as if i finally got my wish. A GREAT soundtrack, tho i have one complaint, where's the version of Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" on the soundtrack?  10 out of 10 stars easily.

When a young courtesan, Satine, and a ""pennyless writer"", Christan, fall into an unlikely triangle with a conniving Duke, the plot twists into a hysterical comedy and tear jerking tragedy all rolled into two hours.  With a killer soundtrack including, Beck, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreger, and the infamous ""Lady Marmalade"", it's not just about the scenes but also about the back ground and foreground tracks.  Still if you are expecting to get every tune in the film on CD, you had better buy the DVD because the fourteen song album only holds a fraction of the actual music in the film. Still with all the sounds and wonderful performances, this is probably the best film of the year because of the well developed plot and outright crazy sequences.

Not since ""Titanic"" has a movie gotten me this excited!!  Even though they are very different movies, they have the same ""feel"" to them, i.e the long lines of people waiting to get in; the heart-wrenching love story; audiences clapping throughout and at the end; at least half the theater sitting through all the credits.  I've seen it twice and will definitely see it at least a few more times.There is so much visually to take in that it is impossible to catch everything in one showing.  Baz Luhrman did a remarkable job.  I really enjoyed his version of Romeo & Juliet, but this even surpasses that!Nicole Kidman & Ewan McGregor were amazing and so good together.  And who knew they could sing so well!  I agree this movie is probably not for everyone, but even if you are not a ""fan"" of musicals this will ""knock your socks off!""  It is a roller coaster ride of emotions & visual & musical stimuli that will leave you breathless - and running back for more!I really hope the ""critics"" are not too hard on this wonderful movie. Sometimes it seems like they feel it it their job to find fault with movies rather than ""experience"" them.

1077,camiloarenivar,My favorite movie of 2001 So Far!,10,6 December 2001,"Moulin Rouge is not just a romantic musical, it is a theatrical experience of the heart, eyes, mind and soul. This film delivers a moving passionate love story amidst cutting edge electric direction and music deliveries that dazzle the senses.Set at the turn of the century in France's bohemian subculture, this film tells the tale of a man, Christian (Ewan McGregor) who goes there from England to write about the movement. Instead, by a strange twist of fate he is talked into writing for a play at the famed Moulin Rouge. He ends up becoming enchanted by Satine (Nicole Kidman), the main star of the Moulin Rouge who is also a courtesan. Christian falls uncontrollably in love with her.The movie is cute and charming, very, very romantic. For those who scoff at the high concepts of love, this is movie is definitely not for you. This film also contains singing and dancing in a theatrical manner. But the funny thing is the songs are not all Julie Andrews type songs, most of them are modern hits of the last decade or so, like Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" or Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" (which gets a truly hillarious delivery). Notice how I didn't say it was a musical? To call this film a musical is like calling Mt. Everest a tall mountain. It underscores the greatness. All of the actors in this film do their own singing, even Nicole Kidman, and shock! She sounds good. Both Nicole and Ewan underwent weeks of singing lessons for this movie. Ewan has an incredible voice and is a powerful actor.The entire production, the costumes, the characters, the musical numbers, it is all very visually captivating. Baz Luhrman's (Romeo & Juliet) production is cutting edge, bringing an animated feel to the movie, and adding much life to it. If you are open to new deliveries of old ideas, and enjoy romantic love stories set amidst pending doom, this will be a movie you should not miss. This film will not be for everyone, but for me it was a pleasant surprise. It will be a shock if it does not pick up an Oscar nod for music and costumes, if not a nomination for Best Film of the Year, which as December 6th, it is for me!",Moulin Rouge!
1078,sebchen,"This one is not for everyone, just those who love music and movies.",10,17 June 2001,"A dazzling and dizzying delight to the senses. Moulin Rouge is an unexpected homage to the 20th century songbook that's fantastic as a fairy tale and familiar as a cherished LP. Don't be surprised if you find yourself breathless at one moment and weeping the next. This movie is a thrilling carnival ride and classic musical tragedy rolled up into one. The fusion of soundtrack, visuals and plot is nothing short of deft craftsmanship. I don't mean to be vague but to give specific details would be to take away from the surprising pleasures that await. I can say that this ride left me completely satisfied.",Moulin Rouge!
1079,radionut,A Unique and stunning treat!,9,22 January 2002,"The pace at the beginning is frantic - but it's a wild, magical and fascinating ride. There has never been a movie like this folks. The production quality, visuals, special effects, settings, and more are all truly spectacular. Of special note is the ""Tango de Roxanne"" which will leave you believing that ""Roxanne"" had to be written in 1900. The brilliant arrangement of the song and the vision of 30 couples simultaneously dancing a dirty, almost violent tango is absolutely captivating. Other numbers of note are the hilarious send up of ""Like a Virgin"" and the ""Lovers Medley"". See it. This isn't just a movie - it's a life experience.",Moulin Rouge!
1080,mail-156,These are perfect performances by Kidman and McGregor -- both emotionally and the way they look..,10,3 June 2001,"This is a fresh, exciting movie that has to be seen, and seen on the wide screen. It is brilliant in many aspects, with few valleys. I would have enjoyed more coverage of the dancing and a few less camera swipes, fly-arounds, and quick cuts, though. Some of the art direction is breathtaking. Nicole Kidman is absolute filmic beauty.Most incredible is the way Kidman and McGregor stay within their characters and make their romance real and totally believable -- not so much as a story but as a magical connection that burns between them. Both have a screen presence in this film that is magnetic and captivating, and when they are together their combined energy makes looking away from them impossible. They are brilliant, and since many of their scenes with sustained emotion and emotional development are cut together from footage in totally different make-up, costumes, settings, and lighting, the work of both the director and editors must be considered brilliant, as well.",Moulin Rouge!

It's propably the most beautiful movie I have ever seen, audiovisually and by the cliché storyline. Everything is beautiful and melancholy. The music ain't very good in itself, but the main actors make it sound beautiful. You have to dig your fingernails into your palms to stop yourself from sobbing, when Christian sings ""why does my heart cry""...*sigh*... Moulin Rouge! is a beautiful faerytale, which makes you feel unreal. I'd hope it'd stay in the movie theatres for ever and ever, and see it again and again.",Moulin Rouge!

It's completely pretentious and without any sort of merit from an artistic standpoint. Nicole Kidman is a square peg in a round hole in a musical, period. She's mediocre to begin with, overvalued as an actor in general, and horribly miscast in this movie. I couldn't even watch the movie. If I hadn't fallen asleep 3 times while trying to get through this horrible film, I'd want to throttle most of the actors for over acting. I realize I'm in the minority here, but anyone who thinks this movie is unique has never seen a decent Broadway musical.This movie is Velveeta on Wonder Bread. I guess that's what the masses eat for lunch, so it figures that most people would like this. To me it it's a waste of good celluloid.",Moulin Rouge!
1083,towdfwag,"before this, i hated 'your song'...",10,19 July 2001,"ok, so i have now seen this movie 4 times.  i have made others see it with me.  i have the soundtrack.  but there is not a single song in that movie (of the covers, that is) that i liked, or even tolerated, before i saw the movie.  but now,  when i listen to the soundtrack, i feel the way i usually feel when i listen to the smiths.  but enough about the music...i am not quite sure what has drawn me to this movie.  the first time i saw it, about 2 weeks after it opened, the theater was packed for the matinee. the audience was 'into' this movie, which perhaps enhanced my view of it. people laughed, people cried, everyone stayed till the end of the credits (!).  the males in the audience were crying!  i was crying!  it was an audience love-in.  the second time i saw it a few days later, it was again packed.  people walking in were singing 'because we can can can'.  there was a grandmother with her grandson.  they both left crying.  as did i.  by the third and fourth times i saw it, i was bawling openly for the last 20 minutes.  i can imagine that those who are not used to the lightning-fast style of mtv would get a little disturbed by the editing style, but i found that it really enhanced the whirlwind feeling of suddenly being dropped into the moulin rouge.  people who know me cannot believe that i would be so attracted to a movie about a love story.  the last movie i saw this many times was fight club. i think this movie appeals to a very broad audience: those who appreciate the absurd, those who watch mtv, those who like musicals, those who like tragic love stories, those who have always wanted to see ewan mcgregor not looking emaciated...to all filmmakers:   more musicals please!!!",Moulin Rouge!

I don't think the anachronistic use of modern-day songs could have been more expertly woven into a story, to give it a depth and emotional credibility that just would not have been possible if it were being told ""straight"".This is not a history lesson, and there are no morals or hidden meanings. It is simply a fantasy that takes your eyes, ears, and emotions on a holiday that you wish you didn't have to come back from.An enormous amount of love, passion, and meticulous attention to detail went into the making of this film and every member of the cast and crew deserves a standing ovation for their efforts.An inspiring effort: 10/10",Moulin Rouge!
1085,lookslikerobertredford,"Moulin Rouge! has the stature, not the insight of Talouse Lautrec, unfortunately",3,10 November 2002,"Moulin Rouge was a disappointment.A musical needs its own music. Not only did Moulin Rouge! fail in that, but the music it had was well-known prior to the movie and identified with a modern era.Indeed, each time the characters broke into song it yanked the viewer out of the 1899 setting of the movie. So well-known is the music that it seemed like even the most serious scenes were comedic, with the joke being the character partaking in anachronism.The costumes, however, were wonderful. They suck the viewer into the period and feel of the movie.Too bad the music causes the viewer ""toulouse lautrec'' of time.",Moulin Rouge!
1086,Gillybean689,absolutely fantastic,10,14 September 2007,"This film is not only visually stunning, it has an amazingly, beautiful and touching story. It tells the story of a young, naive writer named Christian (McGregor) who comes to Paris to try and start his career. After making friends with some rather scrupulous characters, including famed absinthe soaked artist Toulouse-Lautrec(Leguizamo), he gets into a fiasco involving a bordello, its owner(Broadbent), its star performer(Kidman), and a Duke(Roxburgh) who is to invest in an upcoming show. The film then takes the viewer on a whirlwind journey through romance, comedy and tragedy. This is a truly breathtaking film full of exciting musical numbers and superb acting from the whole cast. An easy 10/10.",Moulin Rouge!
1087,lougray,Thrilling.,10,15 March 2002,"People I've watched the film with have said that it rips off some great songs, but as far as I am concerned the songs are used well, especially Roxanne, which no offence to the 'Police' was a better version in Moulin Rouge. Its the cinematography but not only that the acting, ecstatic. I feel sorry for Baz that he wasn't nominated in the directing category for the oscars. However, I do wish Nicole Kidman the best of luck considering she totally deserves best actress with an absolutely stunning performance in Moulin Rouge, even better than The Others, she has really sprung into action in the last year and deserves one hell of a congratulations for it, what better with an oscar. This film makes love out to be fantastic and Hollywood and the audiences have been waiting for a romantic tragedy (Romeo and Juliet not quite right) for years and finally is delivered, screw Lord of the Rings, I may be British but Moulin Rouge has got more of a watchable storyline, shame that it is up against Lord of the Rings, which will probably run away with it this year at the oscars, any other year Moulin Rouge would be the best. Good Luck Moulin Rouge and Nicole Kidman, I'll be watching.",Moulin Rouge!

This was so over-the-top stupid ... without the sexual content, I could have taken a nine-year-old to see it and he or she would have enjoyed it. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous, so why make her do such ridiculous scenes in the first half, like in her chambers when she's dancing with the others in that improvised skit? The supporting cast, especially Zidler, made me feel like I was being held hostage in a carnival gone bad. The beautiful costumes and equally beautiful Ewan McGregor made me stay for the full two hours to see if Moulin Rouge got better, but sadly, it couldn't get much worse.",Moulin Rouge!

A period setting with modern music hightening every scene. The funny thing about it is....it works! Whoever arranged all the music deserves an Oscar, and even though we're only halfway through the year, expect ""Moulin Rouge"" to get a few Oscar nods in Costume Design and make up. The cinematography is like a theme park ride taking you through the streets of Paris and into the characters windows, and with more close ups the actors to really make you feel like your sitting right next to them. If you haven't seen this film yet, what are you waiting for? I've seen it three times and each time the audience applauds, which is something I haven't seen in a long time!

Ewan McGregor used his charm and acting ability to make you love him and his character! Great cast and great acting make this movie a must see. The fact that they can blend songs from 1930ish to 2000 is amazing! The lead characters will attract you to the movie, and the music will keep you yelling for more! Truly a great film that involves drama, comedy, music, and dancing while not falling to the chick flick genre. One of the greatest parts of the movie however is only on the video as the extented dance scene. This scene truly shows that it will be a cult movie and a Broadway hopeful! DO NOT let the fact that Lil Kim, Maya, Christina Augurliara, and Pink do a song for the soundtrack! THe music in the movie is far better including songs from Elton John, Madonna, Beck, Nirvana, Pattie LaBell, Bono, Sting (the Police), and sooooo many more!

After all this is ""A story about love"" The thing about this movie is that it's not just weak romance... it's REAL PASSION... And you can feel that when you watch this movie. There is this force between Ewan and Nicole in this movie and the love in the script actually comes onto the screen and you can actually FEEL the passion they're feeling when you watch it.

1094,kalori,"Flashy, but ultimately lacking heart",4,22 May 2001,"Moulin Rouge is VERY obviously a Baz Luhrmann film.  With all the trademarks of his previous ventures it begins with the promise of greatness. Unfortunately there is something lacking and I can only surmise that it is heart. There are some fantastic moments in this film and the actors are all perfectly cast and beautifully portrayed, however, in hind-sight there is nothing new in the movie which would warrant a return viewing. I also thought there were a few opportunities missed, which may have made the film more enjoyable, albeit more predictable. Moulin Rouge was an interesting attempt from a director who has so much more to offer.  Maybe a smaller budget and less hype will allow him to experiment once again and hopefully next time hit the mark. See it once, but I doubt you will see it again.",Moulin Rouge!
1095,aubreysinger,A Technicolor Yawn,1,27 January 2002,"In a way, Moulin Rouge typifies everything that's wrong with American cinema by bastardizing everything that's right with its European counterpart. Visually, the movie is a great reference for any commercial or video director. But unlike a music video that lasts only three minutes, Moulin Rouge begins with a visual volume worthy of Spinal Tap and tries to sustain it for 120 minutes. It doesn't work. The rule of dynamics applies as much to a pretentious musical as it does to an ambitious action film. If the volume is too loud, you simply can't hear anything. Everything gets lost in Moulin Rouge's hurricane of desperate art direction and production design. The film's leads, talented actors though they may be, simply aren't charismatic enough to compete. The movie requires posturing, not acting. And, frankly, there are no less charismatic actors than Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. In fact, their appeal is in their pastiness, not in their screen presence. What's more, the music can't compete either. Great songs are dwarfed by the never-ending onslaught of CGI visuals, which, after a while, become tedious. We get it, already. The moral of this story is that you still need one to make a good movie. Nothing can replace pen and paper. Unglamorous though it may be, a good script is everything. The filmmaker's previous effort with Romeo And Juliet worked precisely because he had a great script to begin with. The production design was icing on the cake. With Moulin Rouge, icing is all there is, and a satisfying meal it does not make.",Moulin Rouge!
1096,Warhoss,"Inane tragedy, and boring, too.",3,2 June 2001,"When I went to see Moulin Rouge, I was expecting it to be many things, visually magnificent, a tragic love story, musically splendid, etc. But more than any of these things, it turned out to be... goofy. Go figure. Following a Bohemian poet, Christian's (a boring Ewan McGregor) journey through the underworld of the nightclub/bordello Moulin Rouge and his disastrous romance with its biggest star Satine (an embarrassing Nicole Kidman) proves to be, of course, a Luhrmann feast for the eyes, but generally lacking in substance. The movie is told through flashbacks as Christian tries to recall the story of his life for the past few months. Since entering Paris, he has met and befriended a wide array of Bohemian artsy types, such as a directorial midget with a speech impediment known as Toulouse Lautrec, (played by a desperate John Leguizamo), a meaty ringmaster, Harold Ziedler, (an inconsistent Broadbent) who owns the Moulin Rouge, and the only hilarious character in the film, a narcoleptic Argentinian (played to indulgent perfection by Jacek Koman). Our somewhat charismatic hero is immediately thrust into writing a musical production, which he bases on his own love battle for Satine with the rich underwriter of the production, the Duke, played by Richard Roxburgh in an acting approach more one-sided than Rambo. Through all this, Luhrmann interweaves plot gimmicks stolen directly from Shakespeare in Love, a visual atmosphere that assaults the senses and actually crosses the line I never thought Luhrmann could cross, that of over extravagance. Too many quick cuts and fast speeds alienate the viewer and can't draw the audience's attention away from the general cheesy air of a cardboard production. All this, the plastic performances, the poor humor, and worse romance could be excused as a mediocre production, were it not for the million silly references to pop culture which not only fail to amuse, but also place the audience out of the movie. From Christian singing Celine Dion to a ridiculous dance version of Madonna's Like A Virgin, these devices disappoint and reduce the entire film to a shallow joke.",Moulin Rouge!
1097,ana_galeazzi,Boring and Unoriginal,3,3 April 2021,"I give this movie 2 stars. One for the visual originality and one for Ewan McGregor's voice.I was honestly really disappointed when I watched this movie. I watched it because I was curious. It had been given great feedback and after I watched it I couldn't really understand why.I recognize that it's visually different from any other movie, but the story is probably the most unoriginal thing I've ever seen. It was really boring.

1099,haritari,Still shaking off the spell...,10,6 June 2001,"This film was enchanting, and that's the best word for it.  You feel almost like you've been pulled into another world, leaving all your cynicism at the door.  This movie takes all of your guilty pleasures, all the things you love to love all alone, and makes it okay to love them right in broad daylight with everyone watching.  It is intoxicating in its beauty, surprising in its originality, and utterly dreamlike.  Ewan McGregor, who's not such a shabby actor in previous works, outdoes himself time and again - the ""bohemian ideals"" he espouses (truth, beauty, freedom, and - above all things - love) are clearly shown in every expression, be it lovelorn, tormented, or wholly joyous.  Nicole Kidman turns in a solid performance as well, sometimes hilarious - sometimes poignant.  It is, however, Mr. McGregor's film.""Moulin Rouge"" captures the quintessential nature of life - that everything we think is bad can be good and that everything we think is good can be bad, and that everything - good or bad - is magical and wondrous and should never be discarded as unworthy.  Greed, lust, purity, artistic ideals, betrayal, jealousy, sacrifice, salvation, truth, and love triumphant even in tragedy - it's all here, wrapped up in a package that takes your breath away and makes you laugh, cry, and sing (and yes, you'll already know some of the words).

1100,mickiequinn,A Gilded Turd,1,14 June 2001,"I, like many others, am drawn in by beauty. And, with Romeo&Juliet and Strictly Ballroom being two remarkable movies, I thought, ""This one is going to be great."" I purposely stayed away from reviews until I could get to the theatre. Much to my dismay, the movie held much contempt for its audience. Nicole Kidman wanted nothing more than to display her talents and executed a terribly shallow role of a character that was very complex.Toulouse-Lautrec was reduced to a caricature of a dwarf with a speech impediment, when in truth he was the embodiment of Montmarte's bohemian scene. It was he who brought artists out of the church and into the newly invented method of mass production and made their art the icons of the age! He was at the center of a movement that later spawned the Beats, the Hippies, and all other degenerates who brilliantly create the words, art, music and theatre of their generations.The fact that the producers spent so much money to give the movie such visual splendor and so little on making it an important piece of art is a perfect representation of a lot of over-budgeted movies today. Couldn't the script have been clever, not trite? Couldn't they have used actual music from the period and given it a modern beat instead of using Elton John and Nirvana? Couldn't they decide whether the movie should be a farce or a drama, instead of something confusing in between? Couldn't the cast embrace the history of their roles (Zidler was great) and then create intelligent satire? I am so disappointed in this movie. I think I'll make myself feel better about the state of film making and go see Shreck.",Moulin Rouge!

This just made the list.I dunno, maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind, but this movie was just a bad music video.  It was loud, the plot was utterly predictable (I didn't need to see the end to know what happened), the ""modern songs with period sets"" was simply a gimmick without purpose, the pace was unnecessarily frenetic, and worst of all, THE MUSIC STUNK.  I can deal with most of the other stuff, but when I watch a musical, I want the music to be good.  Duh.  Whoever says that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor can sing are tone deaf.  I'm a musician, and I know good music.  This is not it.Want a ""I never knew he/she could sing!"" movie?  Michelle Pfeiffer in ""Fabulous Baker Boys"" does OK (not great).  John Travolta in ""Grease"". Tom Hulce (Mozart in ""Amadeus"") in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame.""Want a fast-paced, off-the-wall edited, frenetic movie?  Requiem for a Dream.Want a good musical?  Little Shop of Horrors.  Any Disney animation. The Wizard of Oz.  The Sound of Music.  Singing in the Rain.

I mean it's probably the best movie I've seen in my lifetime.  The movie starts out kinda campy and annoying, but the Green Fairy and the Abstinse stuff was just hilarious!  And when they finally get down to it, the Moulin Rouge nightclub is probably the most beautiful spectacle of lights, music, color, and excitement I've ever seen.  The camera was like a rollercoaster, twisting and turning almost to the point of giving me a headache.  And the music, it was amazing.  One of the coolest things about this movie is how you can mix Madonna and Nirana and come out with something that totally fits with the movie.  But deep down this movie has a very emotional core.  At the end of the movie, everyone, and I do mean everyone, in the theater was either bawling hysterically or trying to cover up the fact that tears were running down their face.  Go watch the movie, it's one of the greatest you'll ever see, you might be surprised when you realize a week later your watching it for the third time wanting to see it again.",Moulin Rouge!

I am watching it right now, for like the 12th time. Bought the DVD, soundtrack. Nicole Kidman, her voice is awesome.But Ewan!!! My god!! He is beyond belief! If I could sing like him, I'd quit acting. The score, the singing, the directing, and the, of course.........acting is superb. If you like tragic love stories, this is for you.

It is a cartoon of itself: vaguely comic,two-dimensional dialogue and vapid plot, absolutely mangled medley of ""Top of the Chart Love Hits"" from yesteryear, and endlessly ridiculous camera and computer gimmicks that define the entire work.

The editing became less hyperkinetic as the film goes on. Stop complaining!Anyway, the film was brilliant and Nickole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have STUNNING VOICES!

Bridget Jones's Diary, Shrek, The Others and of course, Moulin Rouge. I have to admit the first time I saw the trailer for this film, I wasn't too thrilled about it. I had heard numerous rumors that the film was overbudget and honestly, it just wasn't good. Boy was I surprised! From the opening logo, it pulls you right into it's world. The performances of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are phenomenal. They really keep the story moving at such a great pace. Now I have to also admit that I am not a huge fan of musicals but this one takes the cake. The music is extraordinary and both stars capture the feeling so well of each song they sing. I was so impressed with the art direction, costume design and everything. It's great film, not for everyone though. Give it a chance though, i'm sure you'll love it!",Moulin Rouge!
1112,mcnew1@email.msn.com,A SENSUAL RAVISHMENT!,9,14 February 2003,"""Moulin Rouge!"" is one of the most magnificent and most entertaining music-driven spectacles ever made. From its visual opulence to its visionary amalgamation of classical storylines, the movie is a stupendously original and intoxicating romantic tale that may spark a new generation of high-tech musicals (like the recent 'Chicago') and draw a diverse array of audiences back to the multiplexes for a chance to drown in the vibrant energy and manic zest of a good, new-fashioned cinematic show. The movie is a triumph in film making. Everything from the art direction, to the costume design, to the cinematography, to the fast-paced editing techniques, to the eye-popping visual effects, the movie is a dazzling feast for the senses. But don't let that mislead you into thinking the movie is all in-your-face giddy. No, the movie succeeds also on the level of subtle romance (the chemistry between the movie's two lovers is absolutely sizzling) and compelling melodrama.
It's impossible not to admire the film simply for its wonderful performances (Nicole Kidman turns in one of her very best performances ever)and directorial style. However you slice it, ""Moulin Rouge!"" is one of 2001's best films!",Moulin Rouge!
1113,anotes,You need to invent words to describe it.,10,1 February 2009,"It's very rare for me to rate a movie 10/10. I usually give this only to movies which are almost flawless, and I haven't found many.This movie is perfect. There are few films you like or think OK, and there are ones you need to wonder at, if you'd have to achieve what they did, how could you do that? How did they do it? I think, this movie sets a standard no movie ever will repeat. The difference is there, in between, the difference which separates the professionals who are brilliant in their work, put everything they have, work hard and achieve great things, and the geniuses. This is something I couldn't imagine, couldn't invent. And I can only bow down with humility and thank the creators for the chance that I could see it.I feel it silly to list everything, to say it was great, because everything was great. Pacing, effects, music, acting, singing, editing, directing,... I would give an Oscar for everything there's one and for the rest I'd make new categories.Thank you Baz Luhrman. You made me feel richer inside.",Moulin Rouge!

Instead of developed characters and story, we just get a lot of flashy imagery, which at times was amusing, but mostly just gave me a headache.

Visually dazzling; purposefully stunning.And it is satire with us, the paying audience, as the victims.Like the theatre of the grotesque that was contemporary with libertine France of the Moulin Rouge's historical heyday, the audience are being made to confront their own pretensions.The original practitioners were more honest, though. They would use ordinary buckets of poop on their stage. The poop in this elaborate plaything is a vast, elaborate artifact, but it is well aimed.Just as in the old original stage happenings, we gasp, discuss and admire. What fools we all are. And that is exactly the message that the writer and director of this gaudy thing is conveying.One cannot deny that he did it successfully.",Moulin Rouge!

A lot of people have said to me Dan, what a boring movie. but how wrong they were because I left thinking, every time I watch the movie I see it in a different light, a different meaning. based on the classic theme, of good and evil. if you make out who the characters are and the reasons for there actions, you can see through the screen into the True world of Moulin Rouge.

1122,u_raben,Spectacular!,10,18 January 2002,"'Moulin Rouge!' was one of the greatest movie experiences of this year, the acting was great, the songs and instrumental score are outstanding, the art direction and the costumes are brilliant, and Baz Luhrman did a good job for making another 'Moulin Rouge' movie, filled with drama, humor, romance, insane jealousy and tragedy. For the audience who love musicals, and 'Romeo & Julie', 'Moulin Rouge!' is really worth seeing, and even if that the movie slow downs at a time with the many love songs, there is a dramatic and exciting ending of the movie. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is a very nice pair in this movie, but even the two bad guys of the movie steals the scenes, and they does it nice too, with their flamboyant acting.",Moulin Rouge!

I say to those who ""love it"", have you people seen a real musical with original music?  Like maybe ""Fiddler on the Roof"", ""Grease"", ""The Sound of Music""?  Pick any Disney musical from the past fifty years and it would be better than this nonsensical mess.  The only way I can think to make it better would be to turn it into a Muppet movie.  Miss Piggy would be a much better Satine (as she would say, ""at least Moi can speak in a French accent"").  Kermit would be Christian and Fozzy (Waka, Waka, Waka!) would make a great Zidler. Mix in some ""humans"" like Dabney Coleman or Elliot Gould as the Duke.  Gonzo would make a terrific Toulouse-Lautrec and Rowlf (a dog) would be the perfect Narcoleptic Argentinean. I'm telling you Dr. Teeth and Rizzo Rat would fit this movie like a glove.  Wouldn't that be better?  Throw in catchy muppet songs and some wacky adventures and then you would have something to watch!",Moulin Rouge!
1124,diane_janssens,Overwhelming,10,31 October 2001,"For me Moulin Rouge is one of the best films, if not the best film I have seen this year.I was really overwhelmed, and I had not expected it at all.The way of filming, the scenery, the casting, it was for me 100% successful, convincing.  But above all this is the film of Ewan Mcgregor, he is astonishing in his  performance, he IS Christian. I only knew him from Emma (with Gwyneth Paltrow), as Frank Churchill with the awful wig , and also there he proves he is a good singer.  But what he is showing us in Moulin Rouge is a total different Ewan,he certainly is one of the most versatile, talented young actors of the moment. I really do hope he will be able to enchant us again, maybe in the new Phantom of The Opera, he would be the ultimate Raoul !",Moulin Rouge!
1125,crawfo,worst film I've seen in years,1,25 January 2002,"What a dreary experience Moulin Rouge was.  It's the worst film I've seen in years.  The story was unoriginal and mostly predictable, the songs mainly banal (though I admit there are few American musicals whose songs attract me much), and Ewan McGregor can't sing - he just opens his mouth too wide and sounds come out.  Nicole Kidman made quite a good fist of her singing opportunities, though.  She, and maybe Jim Broadbent's comic talent, were the only aspects of the film worth the trouble of sitting through it.  (I did so because my wife mildly enjoyed it).",Moulin Rouge!
1126,hmshanno,A Pitiful Mess,1,31 December 2001,"Wow!  I have not seen a worse movie this year.  Then of course I like reality too much.  But if I want fantasy or escapism, I can see ""Lord of the Rings"" or a fine French movie ""Ma Vie en Rose"".  This waste of celluloid has little to redeem it.  The lone exceptions were the wonderful Jim Broadbent, the fine British actor, who seemed to be the only one in the farce that understood what being campy and over-the-top was.  Nicole Kidman, with her smooth milk skin and lovely looks unfortunately is as interesting as a glass of milk.  I was quite surprised how well Ewen MacGregor could sing.  Or was that his voice?  I am very capable of suspending my disbelief for a movie, but this mess, with its insertion of modern pop songs into turn of the century Paris was so forced and incongruous I left the room frequently (fortunately I didn't go to the theater for this).  I know the whole rational of musicals generally using music that is not specific to the era of the musical itself (i.e. ""Oklahoma), and the attempt was to be over the top and tongue in cheek;  but I didn't have tongue-in-cheek; I had drool on cheek.  8.2 out of 10 on IMDB.  What a disgrace!  This film was a colossal waste of time, money, and energy.  Poor Tom Cruise is all I can say.  This obviously broke up the marriage.  Or was it the simpering ""Jerry McGuire""? At least Nicole took of her privates a bit in ""Eyes Wide Shut"", which displayed her only true attributes as an actress.  I would have given it a zero on the voting scale, but they don't offer that.",Moulin Rouge!
1127,desperatetrash,"Oh, Ewan!",9,25 January 2002,"Anyone who has seen this movie will tell you that it was by far the best performance by an actor this year.  Forget Nicole Kidman.  Ewan McGregor was the runaway star of this film. His character's love for the courtesan was so real. I truly believed every aspect of his character: his joyous outlook on life, his heartfelt belief in love above all else, his spontaneous and beautiful rendering of song (especially 'Come What May' and the 'Elephant Love Song').  Forget Gene Hackman, Denzel Washington, or Russell Crowe. For your consideration, Ewan for Best Actor!",Moulin Rouge!

The potpourri of incredible actors, both leading roles and supporting cast; and inventive usage of modern and old songs gave the movie an incredible presence. Laughing and crying at the same time.

I was overjoyed when it finished because at last I could go home and watch paint dry, which I'm certain would have been much more entertaining.This is a movie that either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough, and its only redeeming feature is Nicole Kidman in lingere.",Moulin Rouge!
1130,minnaely,Bolero dancing lovers (could include some spoilers),9,3 April 2002,"It's can-can! Moulin Rouge bounces in the rhythm of director Baz Luhrman's heart. Man who woke us up in the mid-90's with his ""Romeo and Juliet"" adaptation has brought his new child of revolution into world after a few years of processing. Moulin Rouge is a bohemian musical and most of all love story. Ewan McGregor plays writer Christian who sings himself into parisian courtisan Satine's heart with such speed it makes your stomach  whirl. Not the developing of the lovestory but the set it develops in. Pop art's most known remarks using set decoration and music make a positively psychedelic combination. From the first minutes to the last this story takes the viewer into a wishes-filled world of love, honour -and of course- paying fees. Luhrman's passion for music and dance is admiarable. He continues (in his own, original way) the legacy of 40's and 50's movies which musical numbers where filled with skilful coreographies and colourful costumes. The soundtrack is packed with hits from the latest decades (such as ""Roxanne"" and ""show must go on"") and all new music including the should-have-been-nominated-for-best-song-academy-award ""Come What May"".Kidman and McGregor's performances are great. Christian is filled with little-boy like enthusiasm which makes him lovable. And yes, he can sing. Kidman is, for the first time, actually likeable. Her Satine is emotional and clever woman to whom Cristian offers a chance of her life. The couple play greatly together which makes their ""from love to despair"" story enjoyable. Otherwise quite ordinary triangle love -theme get's new dimension by the colourful characters and visual setting. Jim Broadbent is father-like but business-wise Zidler and John Leguizamo makes small but important role as Tolouse Lautrec. Inspite of all things fast (and quite furious,too)Moulin Rouge succeeds in which it's supposed to: convince the viewer that the greatest thing is boundless love. All I needed was a happy ending!",Moulin Rouge!

1132,adelightfulsong,Left Me Cold-Does That Mean I Lack Passion?,3,8 February 2002,"I didn't feel any emotions besides annoyance and discomfort during the two times-I gave it a second chance-that I saw ""Moulin Rouge"". I didn't feel the love and passion other people said they felt. I think the reason I didn't feel anything was because, to me, this movie is not even about the love which the characters preach so much about. First of all, the movie is more about jealousy than love. Jealousy represented in the silly and incredibly stupid Duke, idealistic Christian, and the prostitute that exposes the two lovers. Secondly, the word ""love"" is constantly used in vain in this movie. It is used to impress. Characters cherish inflated ideas of its importance. The John Leguizamo character keeps on using it to boast how he and other bohemians are so much better than others because they believe in ""love."" I agree with the other viewer who commented on ""the blissfully ignorant use of...the word love"" and mentioned the line from ""The Princess Bride"" (""I do not think you know what that word means""). It seemed as if the movie makers made the characters say the word ""love"" over and over again, so that if they repeated it enough the movie would be about love.False love at the sake of art does not champion love at all. ""Moulin Rouge"" is no true ""champion"" for the love which is supposed to be its theme.",Moulin Rouge!
1133,marymcg,Style over substance - what's wrong with that?,10,7 March 2002,"I saw Moulin Rouge three days ago for the first time, on DVD, and apart from the film, the DVD is very much worth seeing - buying even!You may guess from that comment, that I loved it. 3 days later, I'm still left with a warm glow. The film is unashamedly about love, and I can understand many people hating it, because it's not a substantive film, like perhaps ""A Beautiful Mind"". To me, its the opposite of that film, where you are perhaps led to believe that you a fly on the wall of the life of Nash. Moulin Rouge is about being aware that this is fiction, that these characters aren't real, and showing an idyllic form of love that perhaps everyone should strive for, even if we can never reach it. The Moulin Rouge was a nightclub, and even today when we go to a nightclub, in a sense, its about leaving the real world behind, having a few drinks, dancing like maniacs, and maybe even finding love. Nightclubs are not about substance; they're about leaving substance behind.The film is pure entertainment, a feast for the eyes, ears and heart, not for the brain. The frenetic pace, the colour, the familiar and sentimental love songs, the fantasy characters and the comedy which is absolute farce, make this film a unique experience. The audience is asked to sit back and enjoy, without really trying to preach or teach you anything. It demonstrates that film can be pure art, like a painting or music or dance, with no other agenda but to lift you out of the mundane ordinariness of life.Congratulations to Baz Luhrmann for getting this film made, in an era where superficiality can be frowned upon, and films must fall into a category dictated by marketing people. Congratulations to Baz Luhrmann for casting Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, who were intelligent enough to see what he was trying to achieve, and going out on a limb with him to achieve it. Congratulations to Baz Luhrmann for his originality, bravery and vision in avoiding formulaic or so called ""worthy"" film-making. He has proved himself a visionary before, and he proves it again with Moulin Rouge. It is a shame that the Academy have not acknowledged him this year, because surely this was a directing triumph. I suspect that Moulin Rouge will go home empty handed from the Oscars, but that is an indictment of Hollywood, not of this great film. It is not only the best film of 2002, but probably the best film of the past ten years.Nicole Kidman was incredible in her perfectly judged over the top performance, as was Ewan McGregor for his wide-eyed innocence and purity. And the singing? Brilliant. They looked like two people utterly in love, and gave those old love songs a depth of meaning that they never had before.Maybe I'm shallow, but I'll take Baz Luhrmann's style over Ron Howard's substance any day of the week.Ten out of Ten!",Moulin Rouge!

I saw Moulin Rouge two weeks ago, on DVD. Last week, I rented Legally Blonde, a film I expected to enjoy. I didn't. I thought it was most unoriginal, unfunny, and a bore. The following day, I bought Moulin Rouge on DVD, and I've been watching it since...(without/with commentaries, behind the scenes stuff, choreography etc...there's a lot to get through!)I have a sinking feeling that I'm trapped in a world where the only movie I want to see is Moulin Rouge. Every film I've seen seems to pale in terms of the enjoyment factor. Honestly, it's like a drug! Despite the sad ending, every time, it seems to give me a high.Thanks a bunch, Baz, Nicole, Ewan and the rest of your accomplices, you have ruined my cinema-going forever. I'm off to find a ""Moulin Rouge Anonymous"" meeting.P.SMake it up to Baz for not getting a Best Director Nomination.

This has to be the worst movie ever released (I am talking worse than such bad flicks as Yor, Armed and Dangerous, and even any cheese late night b-movie on Showtime.) I hardly could stand the sight of this so-called ""artistic wonderment"" without wondering to myself if it was possible to have this film banned as a cruel and unusual punishment.I have no idea why anyone would consider this movie a ""GREAT"" film other than those who spend their time talking about the esoteric qualities of Dadaism and the writings of Voltaire.The plot (?) was highly predictable and the characters were less evolved than those from ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" The only thing that could have made this film worse is the addition of the ""cut-scenes"" that are provided on the DVD version.I hate to be so harsh on this film that it seems has found some fan-friendly audience but I would rather wish that my friends live with a colostomy bag than to see this movie.",Moulin Rouge!

The opening credits only heightened the anticipation and for the first twenty minutes or so it was a magnificent spectacle, but then the film got bogged down in repetitive padding. The musical numbers seemed ten times as long as they needed to be and I started to get both bored and irritated, a mood which carried on to the end credits - a shame, as performances were great and the whole film looked absolutely stunning. But I would rather have had more of a script which did justice to the film rather than the same bloody Elton John song seemingly over and over again. I shall rent it out at a later date, just to enjoy the beauty all over again, but I'll be fast forwarding over a lot of the musical bits......",Moulin Rouge!
1141,smarthomewk,All that glitter is not gold!,5,14 July 2002,"Moulin was a big beautiful, energetic waste of time. I give it's makers credit for creating a rather interesting diversion, from the norm. This movie really stinks as a musical, even though the staging of the production numbers was well done. Whoever sang for Ewan McGregor, should be arrested for assault with a irritating weapon of a voice. Ewan McGregor was convincing as a young man, hopelessly, foolishly in love with a very shady lady, with a cough. Let's face it, he must have been totally unconscious, not to have noticed. Nicole Kidman, was drop dead gorgeous, especially for a woman on the verge of death, I felt a little offended at this intermittent cough was used soley for dramatic effect. This woman had one of the most contagious diseases of all time, and would have infected many people way before these events could have happened. Kidman's characterization was arresting, but not enough to forget that she was a user, a manipulator, a cheap, overused woman. Nicole Kidman is very talented, but if she actually had the charisma to pull this part off, it could have mad a very interesting movie.Again, congratulations are in order for the movie's design. Generally high marks for the two major actors; for meeting the challenge of very difficult roles. I don't buy the idea of re-cycled music, even if it is fairly well utilized. With all the effort, that was put into creating a unique visual extravaganza; an equal effort to create a score to match, would have been an major accomplishment.I agree with the person who said this would have worked better as a stage play. I think it could have made a great stage play, even lacking the full movie glitz. Perhaps, this would have made for a more personal work of art, with a heart.",Moulin Rouge!

If you crave flash, and color and lack of any real story you have come to the right place.Modern music in a turn of the century period piece? It is off-putting to say the least.Kidman is beautiful but her voice is not up to this. And frankly her character is tragic but not particularly likeable. At the end when you should be feeling for her you are actually just hoping the movie ends soon.McGregor is a little better but the herky jerky camera shots just leave you feeling more queasy than anything else.I was hoping to see a movie with some interesting characters, music, and an honest to goodness story. Instead all i got was a headache.",Moulin Rouge!
1143,Holden Mcgroin2k2,Love is All You Need,10,17 July 2002,"After due consideration, I have decided that the ever coveted last spot on my top 5 films of all time list has been filled by a captivating piece of cinematic brilliance called ""Moulin Rouge!"". To call ""Moulin Rouge!"" a film is an act of uninhibited slander, for it is nothing short of transcendental cinematic excellence. Baz Luhrman weaves such rich tapestry of well placed fades, camera movement and clever inserts of Christian's narrative typewriter that truly make this an example of modern day storytelling, full of the revolutionary bohemian ideals around which the film revolves, and not merely part of the money making hollywood bourgeoisie. The script is brilliant, with the writers finding clever ways of steering the character's converstations into classic songs, with tweaked lyrics to further the story. An example of this is how Ziedler artfully stalls the Duke from noticing Satine's apparent disappearance by saying, ""you make her feel like a virgin!"" which of course leads into a slightly comical rendition of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" performed by two men, one slightly overweight, one slightly under. The cast is stellar. Ewan McGregor proves he has what it takes to be one of Hollywood's top leading men, with a great range of skills that is not limited to a withdrawal sickened Heroin addict or a Saber wielding Jedi. John Leguizamo as the diminutive Toulouse, gives his best performance since ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"". And no words can be said to describe the Beautiful Nicole Kidman except ""stunning enchantress"". All these elements combine to create one of the best films of 2001, but of all the aspects of this multifaceted masterpiece one rises above the rest. The Score. The songs, unlike in most musicals, aren't an uncomfortable break in  the flow of the film. In fact, not merely musical interludes, the song and dance numbers all help to further the story by driving home emotions that are intensified for the audience, by the powerful music with which they are delivered. An example is the full orchestral Tango scene in which the Argentinean explains to the crestfallen Christain, why one should never fall in love with a woman who sells herself, via a latin flavored version of Roxanne. I am not one who usually enjoys musicals, in fact most drive me insane, so it came to me as quite a shock that I loved this movie as much as I do. When i first saw it I regarded it as good and not much more, but after re-watching it a few times, I've been captivated by the sheer joy of imagining a world full of fun and fancy, magic and mystery, and of course true love. Not only was it artfully directed and beautifully written but it was also an example of a genuine love story. And when it comes down to it, that's all Moulin Rouge really is. A story about Love, a never ending, undying, perpetual, and all encompassing love.",Moulin Rouge!
1144,pippahicks,I just loved this movie,10,13 July 2003,"This is one of my favorite movies and in my opinion the best musical ever. Nicole Kidman is a brilliant actress.  And Ewan McGregor, wow who knew he could sing....?  I love Baz Luhrman's work especially Romeo and Juliet so i couldn't wait to see Moulin Rouge and i was not dissapointed. The movie is non stop colour,music,song,dance and drama that kept me completely entertained.  And the sets and costumes were amazing. If you haven't seen this movie yet you must.It was ""Spectacular Spectacular"" 10/10.",Moulin Rouge!
1145,sgtrobo,"a 10, except....",9,25 August 2002,"...they had to mangle Roxanne.Their copious use of modern pop songs sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't.  Roxanne was one of those times when it definitely did NOT.I think if perhaps a slightly more original score were used, and the pop songs used a bit more sparingly, I could've given it a 10.Unfortunately, I just can't shake that horrid gravel-throated groaning narcoleptic grunting ""Roxanne"".As I said, there were times when the song selection worked perfectly (atop the elephant, ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"") times when it fit in a humorous manner (""Like A Virgin"") and then...the putrid rendition of Roxanne.ugh.Anyway, Obi-Wan shows some darn fine diversity here and Nicole Kidman, well...that was easily an Oscar-winning performance.  I like Halle Berry, but Nicole Kidman's performance was outstanding, I thought, and clearly overshadowed Halle BerryOverall, a fantastically creative and enjoyable ride.  Incidentally, you probably won't find this on TBS' ""Movies for Guys who Like Movies"" marathon list.",Moulin Rouge!
1146,r_oshea,MTV does a musical,4,4 September 2002,The average time between cuts must be about one second. All those relentless changes of camera angle made the movie exhausting to watch. After 20 minutes I cared more about sleeping then what happened to the characters. I slept for the rest of the movie.,Moulin Rouge!
1147,PiperHalliwell,awesome movie,10,7 September 2002,"i was late in seeing this movie, and i regret it sssooo bad. i fell in love with moulin rouge. the story swept me away, the actors gave breathtaking performances, the romance made me cry, and the costumes were fabulous. if you haven't seen this movie, definitely rent it.",Moulin Rouge!
1148,AlphaShopper,MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,9 October 2002,"Moulin Rouge is absolutely, overwhelmingly the most fantastical film that I have ever seen.  I cannot believe that I missed this movie in theaters and never bothered renting it.  I was so blown away by this film - which is funny, because it wasn't until I watched this movie that I remembered that as a child, I adored John Houston's Moulin Rouge.  That was a very different movie, where if memory serves me right, I felt very drawn and empathetic towards Toulouse Lautrec and the Can Can girls.  But it's ironic to see a movie about the same place and same period of time that is so true to the spirit of the Moulin Rouge and yet absolutely different and original from any of the movies that came before it.The cinematography is breathtaking.  I know some people criticized it as being too much but I could not get enough of it.  And Nicole Kidman was born to be Satine.  Ewan McGregor made me feel like I was a little girl getting a childhood crush all over again for the first time.  I cannot stress how much I enjoyed seeing these two opposite one another.  They're not a pair I ever would've thought of, but they work so beautifully opposite each other. The music is Wonderful.  So totally cool to hear Nirvana and Elton John and Marilyn's calling card and Material Girl all blended into a kind of crazy insanely cool operatic opus of modern culture.  Baz Luhrman is in a league of his own and his vision is nothing short of extraordinary.  I enjoyed his Romeo and Juliet due to the visuals and his unique vision of an often told story, but with Moulin Rouge he has graduated straight from grade school to a Master's Degree.Entirely it's own world - absolutely wonderful.  But most of all, exquisite. He has totally resurrected and redefined the genre of the musical and it is an astounding pleasure.  And Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor earned my undying support for taking a chance and committing themselves one hundred percent to the story.  I'm so thrilled that it paid off for all of them and their hard work.A high recommend.  And a gushing 10",Moulin Rouge!
1149,JeauCharm,Brilliantly Executed!,10,24 October 2002,"There is nothing in this movie that one can complain about. Every aspect of it is stunning. Even though the first few scenes are at a fast pace, it sets the mood for what the Moulin Rouge is. It is clear that Baz Luhrman thought of every last minute detail. There is nothing in this movie that is out of place or missing. It is the symbol of perfection. The acting is brilliant, singing beautiful, and incredibly visually stunning. I can't complain!",Moulin Rouge!
1150,feeeshboy,All style and no substance.,2,28 May 2003,"*spoiler within*A perfect example of the decline of artistry in popular culture, not only in itself but in the insidious popularity it gained.  Moulin Rouge was repeatedly lauded for being ""artistic"" by its fans.  No description could be less apt.  The dizzying camera effects, the lavish sets and sequinned costumes, and the purchased rights to sample just about every pop song from the last thirty years: these are not the visions of an artist; they are the machinations of an egomaniac with a morbidly obese budget.All chance of subtlety destroyed in the first few minutes, Moulin Rouge goes on to state its three virtues: ""truth, beauty, and most of all love,"" which it will repeat the names of ad nauseum.  Let's look at those one by one. Truth is utterly lacking in this film.  Set in a turn-of-the-century whorehouse, the production is glitzier than Broadway's ""42nd Street."" Neither this nor the utterly generic plot lends any bit of credence to its claims of truth.  Beauty is not to be found either, as the film is so gaudy that even Nicole Kidman can not stand out.  Her quiet, nymph-like beauty does not go well at all with her surroundings, and she appears pale and sickly (only foreshadowing the end by sheer dumb luck).  That brings me to love, which is the the most sorely lacking part of the movie.  At what point do the main characters fall in love?  Never.  Their relationship consists of idiotic musical numbers and the word ""love"" bounced back and forth faster than a ping pong ball carrying the plague.  Anyone duped by the embarrassing sincerity of Kidman and Ewan McGregor, both good enough actors to force out their hokey lines, clearly does not know what love is.  And ""Sparkling diamond?""  Are you kidding me?I try to watch this movie every time it's on cable.  I *try* to watch it, but I've never forced myself to sit through five minutes of it since I saw it in the theater.  The musical numbers are too embarrassing (with the exception of the cover of The Police's ""Roxanne""), the acting too earnest (with the exception of Jim Broadbent, who is always cool no matter what), and the dialogue too ridiculous (with no exception- none at all).",Moulin Rouge!
1151,JazzyMegs,Satine must choose between the man who can finace her and the man who showed her true love exists.,10,2 January 2003,"This movie was so beautiful. It brings me to tears, yet makes me laugh my head off every time I watch it.The acting was amazing..Nicole and Ewan have perfect chemistry. The singing was beautiful...as Elton John said ""[Ewan] Sings [Your song] Better then I ever did!"" And Nicole's voice just breaks my heart.The story was so tragic. It was beautifuly told by the best director of our time. Baz has such vision. I love him!",Moulin Rouge!
1152,missfiftiesband,Best movie ever made!!!,10,16 March 2003,"This is my favorite movie in the world. The music is great, the dancing is great, the acting is great, as you can see everything is great!!! Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor do excellent jobs singing, yes, those are their actual voices. I could listen to Ewan sing for the rest of my life. This is the one movie I recommend to everyone. So, go see it!",Moulin Rouge!
1153,iluvcrayons07,great music,10,5 June 2003,"I love musicals, and I have to say that this is some of the best music that I've heard in a movie in a long time. My favorite was ""Come What May"", a duet between Kidman and McGregor, which was absolutely beautiful. They both have unique voices, not the best, but rich and powerful, and that's all that's needed in these songs. The only song I was disappointed with was ""Like a Virgin"", which absolutely sickened me and made me hate the song. I thought the tragic love story between Christian and Satine was beautiful, but a little overdramatic and overdone. Their love is best portrayed through the songs. The acting is excellent, especially on Kidman's part. I know the Moulin Rouge are like an abstract acting business, and while those aren't my favorite types of people, their costumes and makeup are very well done. The cuts are also a little too quick moving. The costumes are gorgeous, I love the flashiness of all of it. While I admit it was a little hard to follow, esepcially with all the quick cuts, the movie was great. 8/10",Moulin Rouge!
1154,EnglishRoseMai,Cannot recommend this highly enough,10,24 December 2003,"Back in 2001 when this film came out, my friend and I found ourselves outside the cinema with a choice; Enigma, that dreary-looking World War II film with Kate Winslet, or this, Moulin Rouge, which I had, after seeing the adverts, already decided was not for me.In the end we chose Moulin Rouge and boy am I glad we did.This is a wonderful film, with stunning sets and costumes, great music, and excellent performances.It tells the story of a young writer who moves to Paris to be part of the Bohemian revolution. Here he falls in love with Satine, a glamorous courtesan who works at the Moulin Rouge. Complications arise when 'The Duke' gains the deeds to the club and demands that Satine be exclusively his.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are delightful as the two lovers, while Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh and John Leguizamo provide excellent support.Baz Luhrmann is a director of real visual style and flair, delivering a film that is funny and moving in turns.Musically, Moulin Rouge! is innovative and fun, with modern songs placed into the context of turn of the century Paris - standouts are the Tango de Roxanne, and Broadbent and Roxburgh's hilarious version of Like a Virgin, although there's also a song written especially for the film, Come What May, that is beautiful.This film may not be to everyone's taste, but I strongly urge you to give it a chance. And this is coming from someone who was resolved to hate it even before the red curtain had opened.....still haven't seen Enigma.....",Moulin Rouge!
1155,Chibijoey,A wonderful movie that teaches a lesson. (possible spoilers),10,11 September 2003,"If you ever want to learn about true love, you should watch this movie. It is amazing. At first it was a little weird at first. The bohemians talking and trying to make Spectualar Spectualar, however the movie got better as they enter the Moulin Rouge. The line from the one song, ""How wonderful like is when you in the world."" I love that one line. The songs, the dances, the characters. I fell in love with the movie the first time I watch it. I think it a movie for men and woman. Considering there are a few scenes in the movies that are ""rated R"" material. I would advise against children watching it. But it is amazing with a capital ""A"".",Moulin Rouge!
1156,eejice,Masterpiece,10,29 April 2004,"I have watched this film several times over, and I understand why some vote for less than excellent, I would have too after my first viewing.This is one of the few films that improves by watching it over. The acting is marvelous, the citations are endless, there is humor and irony almost in every sentence and there is strong moral message in it to. The combination is just perfect, the comedy part of the movie does not make it ridiculous and the dramatic part is tuned below corniness.I fell in love with Satine and the film, and I shed tears at the end every time I see it. I strongly urge everyone who have seen the film and do not share my feelings to watch it again",Moulin Rouge!
1157,LindqvistAJV,This film was Spectacular Spectacular!,10,28 January 2013,"I have seen this film countless times as a child and even now I am not bored with it. The film uniquely visual and energetic. The story was cliché but directing, narrative storytelling, soundtrack, and cinematography made up for that. It was full of adrenaline and I think film does even give the viewer space to breathe.Nicole Kidman and and Ewan McGregor at at there best in this movie and they have chemistry in every one of their scenes.The soundtrack was indescribably delightful. It was like the combined the old with the new. For example, I Will Always Love You is an 80s songs but they remade for the film which sounded different but delightful at the same time.The film was an effective blend of tragedy and comedy and was almost like a cartoon (but that's made it special).10 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!

1159,ovm_,Left me cold,1,21 June 2020,"Someone artistic recommended this movie to me after I said I'd never seen it because the shorts hadn't appealed way back when, and the cast wasn't a drawcard for me either.
""Watch it, you'll love it."" So I did, and I didn't... should have listened to my gut (meh)Barrage of colours and sound, felt under attack for a solid 2hrs. Found the tired tropes did not hold my interest or endear any of the characters to me.Ultimately, just not my idea of a good time.Finally, after we're told she has consumption, (TB, highly contagious from coughing, etc.), I was cringing at all the close talking and kissing between the pair of lovers. Or that could be my COVID-tinted view now....",Moulin Rouge!
1160,blondevixen1937,Spectacular! Spectacular!,10,14 February 2005,"I saw this movie over a year ago, and this is one of the best films I have ever seen! If you haven't seen it, I certainly suggest going out to your nearest store and purchasing it!!! Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece, featuring the lovely Nicole Kidman as a nightclub diva and Ewan McGregor as a penniless writer is one of the greatest love stories of the 20th century.The dancing, the singing... Nicole did an excellent job, and Ewan's voice just blew me away!!! I still sing the songs and listen to the soundtracks I have, and it is just something you either love and or hate. I have never seen such a wonderful picture, what else could I say? Even though some of it may not seem unrealistic (at times), who doesn't want a man singing to them like how Ewan does to Nicole? Besides that, they were in love, and who doesn't love a love story? I think Baz Luhrmann is an absolete genius and he is considered God in my eyes. He took the dive, along with everyone else involved in this project, and it was certainly worth the plunge.I am always using the famous quotes from the film, but mostly just this one... ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love... and be loved in return.""",Moulin Rouge!
1161,sam_cornelissen,Just to love..,9,23 August 2017,"'Moulin Rouge' is an experience. From the first seconds in the story takes you away to Montmartre, a bohemian place which you might have heard of, or you didn't even knew it existed. Either way the whole atmosphere and environment of this film will make you feel like you are there with the characters, and you are lucky to be the third person to see whats happening over there.I've watched this film many times, and every time it just amazes me, especially the music. The songs were always great. ""Roxanne"" and ""Your song"" were always beautiful to me. But except for those songs there are a lot of great musical pearls in 'Moulin Rouge!'. The passion that McGregor and Kidman deliver in all those songs is just amazing. I'm not too proud to admit it, but every time i hear ""come what may"" I cry. Because sometimes you have given up on love and when these two marvelous actors sing that song, it makes you want to believe again.For me the whole story is a masterpiece, because you are in a a story which tells about a theater play (kind of inception) while the two are connected in every way. Every time I see it I see more references from the story to the play, and discovering new things is always fun. When you've watched a movie once you already know whats going to happen in the end. But when you still want to watch it again and get touched by all the great scenes including the ending, you know that this movies is definitely worth a 10 out of 10.",Moulin Rouge!
1162,Twinkle8988,The Magic of Musicals brought back to the screen! Woo!,10,23 August 2005,"I love Moulin Rouge. Being a theater person, I love how the story and the feelings of love are communicated in song and fantastic dance numbers. It also had that classic playful feel about it like the old musicals of the 1950s had, with the cheesy grins to the camera and all. Plus the acting is so wonderful; making your heart float over clouds and then suddenly break. Every time I see this movie I cry, even though I know what it happens, it kills me every time. As a an admirer of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor and John Leguizamo, all this movie did was make me admire than even more, for taking such a risk with this movie...because people either love it or loathe it (which is so sad for them). This movie also made me realize what I want out of love...and thats to risk everything for it...ah, also the character Christian is just one of the many characters from movies I would love to have in my ideal man...(Noah from The Notebook and Seth from The O.C) being the other two sides! So yes, this movie is adorable and the songs are so catchy. Especially the Elephant Love Medoly - learn the lines to that song and you'll never go back, you'll be hooked on musicals (Check), hooked on love (Check) and definitely hooked on the Moulin Rouge (CHECK!!!)",Moulin Rouge!
1163,elaina-212-171015,"Stunning visual, great music and acting",9,3 February 2017,"This movie takes a huge risk, with over-the-top melodrama, dancing and extravagant sets, but it works because the acting is strong and the music is great. There is a scene where they incorporate the song ""Roxanne"" as a tango with a huge ballroom full of dancers, while cutting back to a private scene where a courtesan is deciding whether to sell herself, and it's visually stunning with the song used to great effect. This was unlike any movie I've ever seen, in some senses a classic musical but unlike others because it mixes so many styles of music. The actors and the director should all be commended for putting themselves out there and making this work, at least for me.",Moulin Rouge!

And WOW. I understood so much more of it! And I remember the first time I saw it,the moment that Ewan McGregor opened his mouth to sing I was in awe.And now, I've seen this movie so many times i can scarcely count! It's definitely my favorite movie ever! Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have such beautiful voices and they fit together. If you like musicals and a tragic romance this is definitely the movie for you! Baz Luhrmann did a absolutely wonderful job with this film. He took a big risk with this film but pulled it off and it became a hit! I know a lot of people who aren't really into musicals and such, but I got some of them to watch Moulin Rouge and they ended up loving it! This is the best movie in the whole world!!!

1166,soheifox,Come see Predictable Predictable!,3,1 February 2008,"My fiancée, whom I love dearly, had been bugging me to see this movie since we began dating. Now, she is a huge Star Wars fan, and I began to suspect this may have been a case of Ewan-desire and not so much for the movie itself. I still think that's the case. However, I also went into this expecting to enjoy it because I adore musicals. I pointed out that I would have walked out of the theater during the chaotic, pointless beginning but was glad she told me it was a good movie, possibly had a bad beginning. (Side note here: Why do movies perpetuate the myth that Absinthe does.. well.. anything? It's just an anise wine. It's a clean drunk and nothing more, people. Yes, Wormwood is an hallucinogenic... BUT ONLY IN DOSES BIG ENOUGH TO KILL AN ELEPHANT!!) My walk out instinct would have been correct. What a piece of garbage... from the music on down to the plot. The second I heard something from Nirvana, my guts recoiled. But I thought it was a onetime thing just to be cute. Then the movie went on and on and on and on with that crap. Hey, when you're writing a musical? Write at least one or two of your own bleeping songs. Unoriginal hack. Even the big romantic number, Come What May? I can't place it exactly but I am SURE I've heard it before.My fiancée can attest that I knew everything that was going to happen as surely as I could sing the next line of almost every song before the characters did. I said ""She's going to die of some illness."" about 10 seconds after she started dancing with Ewan's character. According to her we were told she dies at the beginning.. but I wasn't in the room yet. The plot was stiflingly boring and predictable, replete with the obligatory forced part wherein Satine tries to convince what's-his-name that she didn't love him. Blah blah blah money, blah blah dying. Blah blah all rich people are evil. Yammer patter whore with a heart of gold. Art and love are truth blah blah the show must go on yammer blah blah. *Yawn* At any point after the first 15 minutes I could have paused the movie, told her the rest of the story, and only have missed some pointless subplot about the proposed ending of the play.This gets a 2, at least, because.. hey Ewan can SING! And sing WELL. It's just painful to hear WHAT they made him sing.And I don't care what the directors and whatnot say. Nicole Kidman is not singing in this movie. She is so obviously lip-syncing it that it's painful to watch.MY overall advice? The beginning was a great hint that I would have been wise to take. This movie is all flash and pretty swirly distracting stuff....incidentally, nobody would ever refer to the famous dance as doing the ""can can can"". When you say it three times, it means something about Euclidean geometry.",Moulin Rouge!
1167,maal-1,Unique movie,1,11 July 2006,"The liner notes on the back of the DVD were very accurate: one said something like ""there's never been a movie like this,"" and it was quite true. I have no idea what I had expected in this show, but it was not a cross between a musicale and an opera, with flights of fantasies between animated and live scenes, a lot of screaming and running around, and general chaos.There was quite a bit of pop music (oldies in 2006) which was not written when Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was alive, and seemed like a cheap way to import music into the show. The original music was interesting, and Ewan Mc Gregor is cute and apparently able to sing! I will look for other movies of his.",Moulin Rouge!
1168,Jjkev5,Simply Brilliant,10,21 December 2005,"What can I say? This movie blew me away. I remember the first time I saw it; I started it late at night, around midnight. By 2am in the morning, I was bawling uncontrollably, and then just sat there and worshiped every name in the credits list. Director Baz Luhrmann is simply amazing. The way he incorporated the music into this movie added so much to the plot. I have to say, my favorite musical part is when the Diamond Dogs come out singing ""Lady Marmalade"" and then the men come in singing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" You would think the songs were written for the movie the way they fit so well into the plot! I'm amazed every time I watch it. The acting that went into this movie was incredible. If you think about it, Moulin Rouge is a play inside a play inside a book inside an opera inside a movie. And yet, as confusing as that sounds, it works out perfectly. Kidman and McGregor are amazing together, and their accents are adorable. Besides them, I admire Jim Broadbent who played Zidler the most. He had a very complex character that was hard to express, and he nailed it. It's been three years since it's release and I still watch it religiously. That's how much I admire this movie.

I wont elaborate on how bad this blemish on the Aussie screen is, all i will say is: the acting was terrible, even for such high caliber Thespians as Mcgregor and Kidman... the sets were poorly constructed... the composition was worse than a 1970's sci-fi... the women too ugly... and would it have killed them to have written an original soundtrack???? if this is the prime example of Australian musical cinema then please, let us never make another musical.the only people who will enjoy this film are the deaf-blind, and the retarded.please destroy all copies. this is something we should not pass down to future generations.",Moulin Rouge!
1170,shanea,"Great cinematography, pity about the plot and the dialogue",1,12 October 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a stunningly beautiful film, with cinematography that manages to capture the flair of Paris in 1900. Unfortunately, that is not enough to make you overlook the ridiculus plot or the contrived script. From the moment Ewan McGregor first began to sing (in a send up of the Sound of Music), I knew we were in for something truly cringe-worthy. This scene was only topped by the version of Like a Virgin (Yes, Madonna's Like a Virgin) sung by the fat nightclub owner and the effeminate English duke. Even a wonderful performance by the ever reliable Ewan McGregor couldn't save this film. My advice: Save your time/money and a few brain cells.",Moulin Rouge!
1171,Lou48,Wow,9,10 June 2001,"I came with the expectation that this movie would be slightly strange, seeing as the director was the same as the one for Romeo and Juliet.  I was not particularly impressed with the filming in Romeo and Juliet, but I admired the rest of the film.  Moulin Rouge went way beyond my expectations for a movie.  I had no idea the movie was about love, as the trailer had been slightly confusing and vague.  What I discovered at the theater was a true gem.  The movie very unassumingly takes its place within the category of musical, though the music in no way draws from the plot or the acting, but merely draws you into the story.  Most musicals seem ridiculous in the way characters spontaneously break into a song or dance.  This movie was in no way ridiculous.  On top of that, the songs were familiar.  In A Knight's Tale, a use of modern music was attempted, but to some haphazardous effect.  In Moulin Rouge, the familiar music was wonderful because it was performed in an entirely new light.  For example, I am not at all a fan of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" but Ewan McGregor performed it so beautifully and with such feeling that I could not help falling in love with it.  The acting was very impressive and believable, though Kidman was a bit over-the-top, but true to character.  On the whole, this movie had a beautiful message to contribute and was expertly and entertaininly conveyed.  A delight to watch",Moulin Rouge!
1172,Chief_Jay_Strongbow,Worst Movie of the Year,1,29 May 2001,"It would be easier to ""relax and enjoy myself"" if my visceral reaction wasn't one of a revulsion at the lack of originality (yes, I know how many seem to view this as ""original"", ""brilliant"", ""dazzling"", ""visually stunning"", et al more appropriately, ad nauseum]). Sticking modern pop songs in a movie about 19th century Paris doesn't cut it as original. Neither does quoting 3 different pop ""definitions"" of love (twice), ""Love is like oxygen. Love is a many-splendored thing. Love lifts us up where we belong"" and treating it within the movie as the world's most beautiful poetry while winking at the audience who know their origins. Plus for something to be visually stunning, the human eye would need to focus on an image for more than the 2-second instances Luhrmann gives the audience. All this added up to a director who was afraid to tell a story rather than a daring artist ""reinventing"" cinema or a movie genre. Luhrmann's use of these pop songs and quick edits were cheap devices and distractions that kept me from relating to the characters or caring for them for one second. In a word: bad; in five words: bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.",Moulin Rouge!
1173,skyraidr,Worthless piece of sh*t,1,14 October 2002,"What a truly godawful movie.  The actors chew scenery in a manner that would put William Shatner to shame, the score consists of ruined, overproduced versions of songs, many of which sucked to begin with, and the direction is a non-stop bore-ride of empty gimmickry.  Even the much-lauded use of anachronism is unoriginal: see Ken Russell's ""Lisztomania"" or Alex Cox's ""Walker"" for examples of the technique that actually have some redeeming value, unlike ""Moulin Rouge"".A steaming pile of dogsh*t is still nasty, no matter how many bows and ribbons you tie around it.",Moulin Rouge!

Modern songs brilliantly segue one into the next and seamlessley enter and exit the script. An aural and visual treat.Don't miss it.",Moulin Rouge!

I just saw a free sneak preview and am planning to pay money to see it again as soon as it comes out, which should tell you how much I liked it. The most obvious influences are Fellini, Busby Berkeley, Bob Fosse's ""Cabaret"" and MTV, but there are a lot more. I can honestly think of no movie enough like this one to say ""If you liked X, you'll like this."" It is that unique and original.",Moulin Rouge!

I know people who don't who have only seen it on DVD or Video, and I can understand that because I've also seen it on DVD and it almost doesn't work in that medium.  You need the big screen with an audience to get the whole sensation.  The DVD did answer a number of questions about the editing of the ""Come What May"" scenes where it's choppy and people are not where they should be or are on stage and at the same time in the ""audience"". Sorry to hear that ""Come What May"" was not eligible for an Oscar because it was used somewhere in ""Romeo and Juliet"", but it's still a great song. In any event, the show will still go on and on and on. Bravo!",Moulin Rouge!

Presenting the performance as if we were sitting in a live theatre. The colours are incredible, so bright and vivid. Excellent settings and costumes. The essence of the age was captured so well. OK, so the singing voices aren't perfect, but the way the songs were intertwined was witty and amusing. And for a thirty something like myself I amused myself trying to spot the various song titles throughout the film. I can also understand the negative criticism. If musicals aren't your cup of tea this film would be dire. Indeed I was reluctant to go and see it and this is the only failing: i.e. as it is a musical it will put people off. But if you open your eyes to this feast of a cinematic presentation then this film will be very hard indeed to better. Here's hoping Nicole Kidman gets an Oscar nomination, as well as various members of the production team from the director to designers. A brilliant piece not to be missed.",Moulin Rouge!

The two films have a lot in common:  they both seek to define love, they both stress the play within the play (always an appealing technique), and they both are about male playwrights seeking the girl of their dreams. Wonderful direction, filming, and editing.  It truly will appeal to the MTV generation and their parents. Go see it!",Moulin Rouge!

If you like that sort of thing then go see this movie. If however you like movies to have an interesting plot, authentic acting, characters you can care about and a camera that stays still for a few seconds at least, then save your money. Nicole looks good but the sex-appeal is just not there. The music is silly. I felt sorry for the actors. The supporting cast is forced to do the worst acting of their lives.

We, especially her, had been wanting to see it for a while. After the movie was over, we were spellbound! The music was tremendous and catchy. We literally could not stop singing the songs all week while in Hawaii. On the way back from Hawaii, guess what movie was playing again! We both looked at each other like 2 little kids and quickly grabbed our headsets so we could watch it a second time. The story is beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. I highly recommend seeing it with an open mind. Seeing this movie with a closed mind will ruin its beauty. Remember, ""All you need is love!"".",Moulin Rouge!

The only positive was that Nicole Kidman looked fabulous, but even her looks couldn't pull this off.  The music was beyond poor.  I found myself thinking of all the people who would be collecting royalties for the use of their songs.  I am a huge fan of the old Hollywood musicals that I believe Baz Luhrman was trying to pay homage.  Unfortunately, it seemed more of an insult.  I can't imagine why anyone would have backed this debacle.",Moulin Rouge!

As an artfest it fails due to the most amount of cliches and hackneyed 1-second scenes I have ever seen. And as a musical it is without comparison as the lowest form of musical intelligence. Who ever thinks that putting together OTHER PEOPLES songs is artistic should listen to Jive Bunny. And whoever thinks that poetry could be allowed to consist of quoting Elton John or Bernie Taupin's song lyrics should listen to this movie in 6 months. And once more, whoever thinks that Nicole can lipsync should at least be grateful she didn't sing live. She cannot sing. Period. The characters are banal, without any substance or body and the movie effects are very amateurish.Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.....",Moulin Rouge!
1187,ophelia-29,"Pure Theatre at the cinema!! ""spectacular spectacular""",10,5 July 2001,"This is a film I've been waiting all year to see and I wasn't disappointed. The visuals are just amazing. The emotional impact of music and song in a film has been missing for so long it's great to have it back with this amazing treat. The acting was great (though a little corny at times), the set designs left my jaw gaping open and the songs were 'spectacular spectacular', the modern twist made you want to sing along as you watched. Well done to Ewan and Nicole who can both sing brilliantly!!This is arty blockbuster at it's best and a film you can see again and again just due to the pace and beauty of the production, pure theatre on the cinema screen. I've been waiting for a long time to see a love story where there's actual chemistry between the leads, the emotion seemed throughly believable. I laughed, I cried and I wanted to see it again once it finished. A cult classic in the making!!
Thank you Baz Luhrmann for giving me a throughly enjoyable evening, Please make more films like this!! The musical is back with a bang (and feathers)!!***** out of ***** I'd give this film more if I could!!! this is definatly in my top 10 favorite films.",Moulin Rouge!
1188,heather-57,not for the artistically deprived!,10,7 September 2001,"This movie is great art.  It revived my faith in the medium of film and it revived my faith in humanity.I went into it not caring much for Nicole Kidman and expecting that the anachronistic use of modern pop songs would be a travesty.  Boy, was I wrong, on both counts.  Kidman was utterly fantastic (she has got to win an Oscar!) and the use of pop songs was delightful.  Ewan McGregor?  Well, I liked him OK before, but he captured my heart in this.  He was beautiful and luminous.  Everyone was.  They let their lights shine.  That's thanks to Baz Luhrmann.  He helped them to open up and do the weird scary stuff, like singing (which was so moving that it brought me to tears many times).  Yes, the script was negligible but look what they did with it!  Compare, for instance, to ""Phantom Menace"", which was an exercise on how to degrade the talents of wonderful actors.""Moulin Rouge"" isn't a perfect film by any means -- there's a section in the middle that feels disconnected and choppy, and I wish there was more dancing shown -- but no great work of art is completely perfect.If this movie doesn't win a cartload of Oscars then there's no justice in the world.  But even if it doesn't, I'll still treasure it.  Like the best films of all time, it catapults you to a different universe and brings you back changed for the better.Another opinion: my husband, a musician who has played in so many musicals that he hates the genre (and almost never sees movies more than once), has seen it twice.  He thinks it's the best movie musical ever made.  We can't wait for the DVD to come out!",Moulin Rouge!

1190,mlc3,"Not a blockbuster, but a piece of art",10,15 March 2002,"For starters, I love Moulin Rouge.  It gets a 10.Moulin Rouge does *not* possess a very interesting story.  It's trite. What's more, the foreshadowing of the plot is so blatant that ""shadowing"" is not really accurate.  However, the movie is exceedingly artistic, and that is how it succeeds.By using a well-known story, the essence of which being classic although overused throughout history, Baz alleviates himself from having to concentrate on plot.  The movie does not suffer from misunderstanding, from which many movies with intricate plot lines do.  As a result, he is able to pour his efforts into *how* the story is told rather than *what* the story is.  It is the means the artist employs, not his/her subject matter, that keeps art enduring over the years.  This is the reason that I view it as one of the best movies ever created.  Long after summer blockbusters and feel-good or PC critic-choices fade into the background, Moulin Rouge will still be memorable as a movie that pushed the limits, shattering illusions of how cinema and musicals should be created.The basic framework of the movie is highly original for film and highly artistic in itself: the echoing of drama with music, the direct links between dialogue and impending action (e.g. Zidler states they will rehearse tomorrow the scene when the ""lovers are discovered"" and promptly he discovers Christian and Satine's love affair), and the collage technique - pasting snippets from other compositions, both musical and cinematic.  For those with a knowledge of 20th century music, Moulin Rouge has many artistic similarities with Luciano Berio's _Sinfonia_, the third movement.Layered on this framework is the acting, which is impeccable.  The four main characters (Christian, Satine, Zidler, and the Duke) were cast perfectly, and their performances are interesting, fresh, and convincing.  Nicole finally has chosen a role where she can really explore her talents, and in Moulin Rouge we can finally see why she is a big name actress.  Richard Roxburgh and Jim Broadbent handily juggle their comic roles with their more serious characterizations.  But Ewan's performance really takes the cake. His character is one, which, in practically every incarnation, is the annoying, hopelessly naive, nauseatingly optimistic boy-next-door.  Yet, Ewan's performance is so genuine and fresh (yes, fresh!); I never once wished him ill.  Ewan took a usually distasteful character and made him lovable.The sets and costumes were stunning and vibrant only when they needed to be. And Baz's use of sepia backgrounds produced wonderful contrasts throughout, but particularly in the second half of the movie.  The lighting was used effectively to complement the mood of the scene, not simply to illuminate the set nor to establish the mood in its own right.  The editing was also very effective.  The quick cuts can be daunting, especially during the Can-Can sequence, but I believe they are used to great effect, allowing Baz to keep only the most convincing shots of a take.  The performances of the actors can be contributed as much to Baz's editing as the actors themselves. In addition, there were unusual camera angles, which cast an atypical view of a scene.  My favorite is the shot after Christian shouts at Toulouse to leave him alone.  A typical shot would be a tight close-up to show intensity.  But Baz instead shows Christian's entire body sitting rather lifeless in bed, which really illustrates Christian's true emotions - sadness, despair - rather than the quick and easy emotion of anger.In the end, Moulin Rouge is a work of art.  Fruitful debate will stem not from it's plot, but rather from more academic discussions of it's technique and form - how the movie *reinvents* the Orphean myth rather than qualities of the myth itself.  And for those that enjoy it, Moulin Rouge can be watched numerous times.  There is so much detail and self-reference - especially some intriguing flash-forwards -  that one can pick up on something new each viewing.As for advice, if you need an intriguing, suspenseful plot, you will probably not enjoy Moulin Rouge.  If, however, you can enjoy a movie solely for its artistic qualities, I believe you will enjoy it.  Nevertheless, I suggest that everyone view it at least once - if not twice to pick up things that one cannot notice the first time - because it is truly a movie different from anything else ever made.",Moulin Rouge!
1191,gylzgirl,Spectacular! Spectacular!,10,19 July 2001,"In the short time since this movie opened, it has become one of my all time favorite films ever.  Moulin Rouge is fast, furious, and gorgeous.  It will take you from extreme comedy to extreme tragedy and all points in between. Not one member of the cast is lacking.  Ewan McGregor is incredible as an actor and a singer.  The same is to be said of Nicole Kidman.  Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo also give standout performances.  The music is familiar, brand-new and completely brilliant all at the same time.  It is said of this movie that you will either love it or hate it.  And I agree with that.  But I think most people that gave it a real chance loved it.  It's an unforgettable movie experience.  Vive Le Moulin Rouge!",Moulin Rouge!
1192,Jan27Jay,"Visually stunning, magnificently crafted musical genius!",10,8 June 2001,"As much as I loved this movie, it is a difficult one to decribe in words. Ewam McGregor takes great songs and makes them greater, when you expect little but for them to be butchered.  The speed changes in the film give it almost a roller coaster feel, propelling you through what you are not sure is a musical, or a spoof on musicals.  This is honestly a movie I was dragged to by my fiancee, and I didn't expect to even stay awake through it, much less enjoy it, but I found myself going back to see it again two days later.One of the most captivating films I have ever seen.  Thanks Baz.",Moulin Rouge!
1193,clifton jack,Absolutely stunning movie but....,9,20 September 2001,"I totally agree with all those other contributors who've heaped such lavish praise on this movie.  As a spectacle it was stunning, an assault on the senses, but I don't think I've ever come across a movie where the views of the critics are so polarised.  It's either one of the best films of all time or else it's total garbage.  When I saw it at least 6 people walked out.  I guess some people don't like weird movies, and let's face it this is a weird movie, it doesn't obey any of the rules, and some people are obviously uncomfortable with that.But I do have one big criticism, and that is Nicole Kidman's performance. I did not believe for one minute that Satine loved Christian. She was too cool, she was too distant, she could have been wondering how the hell she got involved in such a movie, but she was not in love.  I've asked myself several times whether that mattered in such a surreal film where style triumphs over everything, but I think it does.  Love is the message, this is a film about love and Baz Luhrman could have found an actress who looked as if she was mad about the boy.  Instead we got Kidman trying to be Marlene Dietrich.It was still wonderful, but it could have been almost perfect.",Moulin Rouge!
1194,cjfl512,Hopelessly disappointing ----,1,8 June 2001,"I feel keenly that ""Hollywood"" seems no longer able to produce ANYTHING on screen that can reach the discerning public.  This film -- was it a film?? or a video-taped hopeful for broadway?? -- the ""singing"" was just so -- just so flat, loud, and emotionless, reminding one of a b-grade and copycat off-broadway score ... and one should not even mention that it was totally out of era (don't tell the kids - they'll believe anything we show them at this point) ... I thought this film (movie seems a better word) gross and disgusting in every sense. I worry some that we had to allow Nicole Kidman a flaunt of her assets on screen just before and during her much hyped divorce from whats-his-name. Along with the recent throw up of a re-made Pearl Harbor, (see Tora, Tora, Tora for a much better propagandic rendition), I feel most strongly about avoiding anything that is made in the hills of hollywood at this point.  If they are worried about revenue, they won't be seeing my money for years to come -- dreadful stuff.  Look to cable and the independents, and don't forget about the Brits and Europe for what is really counting on film.

1197,bjp-2,How Wonderful Life is now this film is in the world!,10,6 June 2001,"I loved almost every second of this movie, hopefully this film will reinvigorate the musical genre. It really is a fantastic experience. Watching the film reminds one why you first started to attend the movies. The acting although slightly over the top by some is perfectly suited to their roles. Nicole Kidman is very impressive in her role and seems to now be in complete control of her craft, delivering on the promise that she showed in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""To Die For"". Ewan McGregor is also very fine, and they both deliver the goods admirably when it comes to the singing. The musical numbers are simply inspired with the Roxanne Tango, Ewan McGregor singing Your Song for the first time, and Like A Virgin being personal highlights. The film itself is very funny but you may find that the tone changes somewhat in the second half and you should prepare yourself for it, it definitely tugs the heartstrings a little bit. The early sequences are very dazzling and fast moving reminiscent of ""Cabaret"" whilst the I believe the plot I believe can be interpreted as being a modern day version of ""the red shoes"". The costumes and sets are very impressive and pleasing to the eye as is every other facet of the film. Director Luhrmann has shown great visual panache in the creation of this wondrous film and turned what was an audacious undertaking likely to be rubbish into the benchmark by which future musicals will be judged. Overall, this is the best film that I have seen this year and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who loves music, movies or life. 10/10",Moulin Rouge!

I can understand why some people don't like it...after all, it wasn't anything like what I was really expecting (I hadn't looked into the summaries very much).  If you try to take it seriously, then you may become irritated with the use of late-20th century music in a film set in 1900. Or maybe you are offended by the parody of the Sound of Music (which happens to be my all time favorite movie) or the operatic rendition of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" or the medley of Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" with Fatboy Slim's ""Because We Can"" or John Lennon's ""All You Need is Love"" with Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You.""  However, I challenge you to look beyond the dates and titles and just let the movie take you along for the incredible journey.  It's amazing how well it draws you into the atmosphere of the Moulin Rouge and, if you're like me, then when it's over, you will surprise yourself at just how into it you really were.  I was amazed by the overwhelming amount of emotion, intrigue, and dazzlement that I experienced while watching this film.  It captivated me more than any other recent movie.  It truly is a film that captures the essence of the Bohemian ideologies of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all else, love.

The blend of modern music was one of the aspects that I loved as a lot of the songs were old favorites presented in a different way.I cannot stress enough that this movie would not meet your expectations if watched on a small screen but the lead actors are a joy to watch and Nicole certainly proved that she can act, not to mention sing!",Moulin Rouge!

Moulin is an MTV style music video at heart featuring good music, fast editing, color, costume, cartoon-like characters, and weak and dreamy love story.  Moulin should have stayed true to its MTV genre and limited itself to 15 minutes in length.Beyond being a well produced music video the film failed miserably in every measure of a full-length feature. The story line was weak.  There was no chemistry between Kidman and the male lead.  This lifeless story is set amidst a backdrop of inane cartoon-like characters, and a twirling colorful headache of dancing and music. Extending the video format to more than 2 hours is a dismal failure.

1206,Tinka_dk,"Both ""old-fashioned cinema"" and ultra-modern film-making.",10,17 December 2001,"It has been said many times (here at this comments board as well as other places) that MR is one of those films you either love or hate. There is no real 'middle of the road' option here. For that reason alone, any serious film buff should watch it and make up his/her own mind. Take it or leave it - MR is an important film.Personally I took one long look at it. And another long look. And yet another. I was brought up watching classic MGM musicals as well as MTV. I may well be the target audience. MR's synthesis of old-fashioned musical magic (just note the ensemble work of the ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" scene) and what some critics have called 'postmodernism' (such as the Bollywood-meets-Marilyn Monroe scene) works for me. It truly does work even if the film sounds absolutely nuts on paper.Visually it is a feast. I cannot remember the last time I have seen such a beautiful, well-designed film. Aurally it is a feast too - I'm not going to give away all the delightful musical references, but some very inspired montages made me simultaneously laugh and gawk.However, the main reason it works so well is because of the actors. Nicole Kidman has been singled out in many reviews - and she is excellent and manages to lose her Icy Queen demeanour - but the film is an ensemble piece. Every tiny part is cast to perfection - at first I was admittedly not sure about the villaineous Duke, but I suddenly realised he was a sinister version of Cecil Vyse of ""A Room with a View"". It made perfect sense. Still, I do feel the need to single out Ewan McGregor. Baz Luhrman has described McGregor as an injection of warm blood into the film. It is easy to tell. McGregor is clearly having the time of his life dancing and singing his heart out. t puts a huge smile on my face.Usually I'm reluctant to give high praise to films - but to me, MR was a clearcut 10. It is a homage to the possibilities of cinema, it is a good-spirited celebration of The All Good Things In Life and finally it is simply just a fantastic film.

While many movie-goers will no doubt entertain themselves by pointing out the identity of all of the songs pilfered for use in this movie, they will hopefully not fail to overlook the fact that this schticky ploy, coupled with the uncomfortable cinematography and editing spearheaded by Baz Luhrmann, really makes the movie more annoying than endearing.Additionally, careful viewers will note a remarkably strong similarity in plot to another recent, far-superior movie, which I will neglect to name so as not to provide a spoiler. However, the aforementioned, nameless film is much better written, is more clever and intelligent, and really blows this movie out of the water.Still, much can be said for the colorful, vibrant set design, as well as the masterful performances by John Leguizamo and Ewan McGregor. Throw in a perma-beautiful Nicole Kidman, and you have a movie that might be worth renting. But if you've figured out which much-celebrated movie I've referred to earlier in my review, I would recommend it much more highly.",Moulin Rouge!
1208,leiawing5,"In a word, amazing.",9,12 June 2001,"Some people will say that this movie is haphazard, that it rushes through things, or that it's just plain stupid. I say that some of those people should not have come in the first place - if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen. :-) The others ... well, I think you've got to remember what it is to love.This movie shows us all what real love is like. It's true, the story could be fleshed out a bit more, but then the movie would have been over three hours and that'd be a bit long. It's the perfect length. The two leads are wonderful. Nicole Kidman shows a range that's surprising, and Ewan McGregor, both looks and sounds like the angel he's supposed to be.Most of all, the music. That's what everyone's talking about. I for one think it worked. Like ""Tango de Roxanne"" - its gravelly undertone and sexy, rough beat, plus McGregor's high, clear background vocals. It's enough to send chills down your spine. Or the ""Elephant Love Medley."" Christian, McGregor's character, is exactly the type to quote high-flown 70s pop to his lady love. And it works.Christian, in conclusion, is the man every woman wants on some level. Satine is the woman who every woman would like to be. (In terms of principles, everyone - not lifestyle.) Outstanding. Just outstanding.",Moulin Rouge!

Truly awful. Don't bother wasting your time watching this.The music was anachronistic. The story was non-existent. The only highlight was Nicole Kidman. The only reason I thought about watching this rubbish was because she was in it.If this is ever on the TV again, I'll find something else to watch.",Moulin Rouge!
1211,kedancre,"Completely its own film, and very good!",10,19 June 2001,"Some movies are so unique that they seem to be the creation of a single mind, a single artistic vision, even if this isn't actually the case.  Such films would include Citizen Kane, Rear Window, The Draughtsman's Contract, the recent Oh Brother Where Art Thou? and, now, Moulin Rouge.  Did I love it?  Yes, in spite of the frequent use of quick-cut editing (cut to new viewpoint every .5 seconds).  Will most people love it?  I can't say, but I doubt it.However, with a movie like this, no one could have told me if I would like it, for no one knows me quite that well.  And if I hadn't seen it for myself now, in a theater, I would have seen it for the first time on a TV set, and (after my dazzled mind settled down a bit) kicked myself.If it helps, the trailer gives an accurate idea of the main plot and artistic style, but doesn't hint at the farcical humor, mostly in the movie's first third.  However, it only gave a hint of the total impact the movie would have on me.",Moulin Rouge!

When I rented this film, I almost turned it off after the first 10 minutes thinking I was right about not liking it.  Then it just grabbed me and wouldn't let me go.  Once Ewan and Nicole met, I was hooked.  I couldn't believe they did there own singing.  I watched the closing credits three times in slow motion just the check it out.  I couldn't get the music out of my head.  I had to run down the buy the DVD two days later just so that I could skip to the music. Two weeks ago I saw it for the first time, and I have seen it in it's whole about 3 more times now.  WOW, sums it up best.",Moulin Rouge!
1213,kay321,This is a musical for people who don't like musicals.,10,8 October 2001,"This was easily one of the best movies I've seen in years. Rarely do movies have a visual force capable of stunning you into rapt silence; and even more rare are films able to further this with a soundtrack that can move you and ensnare you as well, if not better, than the images. Yet some how, through genius, magic, luck, or some combination, Moulin Rouge has managed to do both. In truth Moulin Rouge is a fusion of two fabulous films into one. A film of images capable of conveying meaning without dialog or music, and a film which you could feel and understand with out needing to see it. Much effort was obviously spent on both the visual and audio aspects of this film, and by choosing not to focus on one over the other, and sacrifice the songs for the story or vice versa, the filmmakers were able to make a truly unique, modern musical which those of us who have hated musical since childhood could enjoy. Moulin Rouge is a blend of old, established techniques with innovative experimental ones, resulting in a movie which could only have been made in our time, yet which has a classic feel. The acting is wonderful, the mixture of modern songs is ingenious, and the cinematography is at times simply amazing. The end result is a stunning film with unbelievable performances; a cinematic experience that people will be loving, analyzing and trying to imitate for year.",Moulin Rouge!
1214,fmulleriv,Were you people watching the same thing?,2,6 February 2002,"What is the deal with this film? Over acting, over the top, in your face and obnoxious directing makes this film one of the year's worst. At times it wanted to be a good film and that is what people are liking. They WANTED it to be better than it was. At times, it could have been great, but Luhrmann's direction is all over the place, the script has pacing problems and the acting is laughable (save a fine performance from McGregor). The film made my brain hurt and I don't understand how this thing will get Oscar Nominations. The film is simply forferdelig!",Moulin Rouge!
1215,joshcurley,Too boring to even be a campy cult flick,3,7 February 2002,"I recognize that everyone has different tastes but how can this film rank amongst imdb.com user's Top 250 of all time?  There seems to be quite a few negative reviews from users on this site...I felt so embarrassed for Nicole Kidman in her first scene with Ewan McGregor in the elephant.  Probably the stupidest ""Three's Company""-style innocent-discussion-mistaken-as-sexual-innuendo situation I've ever seen. Did this film have to beat me over the head with ""the greatest thing you'll ever learn..."" and the 4 tenets of the bohemian way of life.  God, I get it already! Love is great.""Your Song"" is beautiful.  But let's face it; wouldn't you rather listen to Elton John sing it?  Sorry Ewan, your singing just doesn't cut it.  As for the scenes in the club, does loud driving dance beat make for a good musical?  I'm not a fan of musicals but I'm afraid that was probably the best part of this completely uninteresting ""love story"".
If the insipid attempts at humor hadn't petered out toward the second half of the movie I could see this becoming a ""Rocky Horror"" style campy cult flick, but it's just too boring.  My ratings -- songs: 5; love story: 2; general storyline: 1.  Simply terrible.",Moulin Rouge!
1216,elestor,The Greatest Musical Ever Made,9,1 November 2001,"After seeing Moulin Rouge I could only think Baz Luhrmann wanted to make the most spectacular, spectacular musical ever. And the only way to do this is on celluloid, because the music, the sets, the effects, everything is just too darn 'big' to perform on stage. A masterfully crafted film, every second must have taken careful planning and shooting. This film is a rollercoasterride of emotions, it starts of very high paced and comedial (is that a word?), then it becomes grand and romantic and ends in deep, deep tragedy. I was absolutely thrilled! Fantastic music, I bought the soundtrack the day after. If this film doesn't get the academy award for best music, than I'll eat my top hat!I voted 9 out of 10",Moulin Rouge!
1217,mach37,Miserable ideas,1,4 March 2003,"Where did the idea come from that singing the first line of as many different songs as possible constitutes a ""Medley?""  Or that using, out of context, the most popular hits from Rodgers & Hammerstein and other great song writers is acceptable?  I was constantly hoping that they would complete at least one piece of music besides ""The Sound of Music"" and that Elton John thing; but no, they kept reciting bits and snatches of recent (and not so recent) pop songs ad infinitum - I wanted to tear my hair out after hearing nothing but sound bites of old favorites for what seemed like five minutes without a break.  And the Folies Bergere & Busby Berkeley cliches - this is not a movie for anyone with musical theater taste of ANY kind, only musical illiterates could like this piece of crap.  Not that Ewan McGregor or Nicole Kidman were bad... they did far more than then material asked for.

1219,smokedfish,A visual orgy about love,9,30 May 2001,"A tragic tale of love in Shakespearean caliber, Moulin Rouge grabs a hold of your senses and never lets you go.  Moulin Rouge starts off at a frantic pace, in which you're thrusted from 0-60 within a blink of the eye. Beautifully directed by Baz Luhrmann, one can see his style from past works of Romeo & Julliet and Strictly Ballroom.  We all know that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman can act, but surprisingly they can sing also.  This is a tale in which all hopeless romantics can enjoy.",Moulin Rouge!
1220,ash_uk,A big disappointment,1,16 September 2001,"My partner and I went to this film expecting, at the very least, to have an enjoyable time and, based on what we'd heard about it, possibly a 'life-changing experience'.This is the first film for many years where we both decided to walk out before the end.What is it that makes this film so appealing to so many and yet a complete anathema to others? Our taste is broad, we give most cinema a chance to engage and enthrall us, but this just left us looking at our watches and thinking of better things to do.Lavish in production it certainly is, with some clever cinematographic tricks that George Melies himself would have loved, but all this cannot make up for the emptiness of the storyline, the dodgy editing, the lacklustre choreography and the butchered songs.Why do people think Ewan McGregor has a good voice? He hasn't! Are people exposed to so much bad singing nowadays that they've lost all point of reference? Even Nicole Kidman's songs were dubbed in the scenes we saw before our exit.Maybe we missed the point of the whole thing, maybe by not staying for the end we missed some crucial and 'life-changing' finale. Judging by the comments of others like us - who thought this one of the worst films they'd seen for a long time - I don't think so. Even with all the hype, a week after opening the cinema was only about half full on a Saturday night - don't be frightened to stand up and be counted all you other Moulin dissidents!",Moulin Rouge!
1221,KenobiBear,Welcome to the Moulin Rouge!,10,9 June 2001,"Going to see to  Moulin Rouge on it's opening night was a night i will remember. Baz Luhrman should be praise for his baby. People may have thought a movie musical was a sure firer flop. Also critics began to doubt it when it was delayed so many times and had to move to different places to be flimed.The acting was excellent. I was a huge ewan mcgregor fan before the movie came out so i always knew he could sing but, Nicole Kidman? She blew me away! I think that the song ""Some Day I'll Fly Away"" was one of the most touching parts of that movie. And Jim Broadbent! Bravo Bravo! he was amazing! And Like a Vrigin! HAHA!I smell some oscars indeed. Best Actor for Ewan McGregor, Best Actress for Nicole Kidman, Best Supporting actor for Jim Broadbent, Best Set Design, Best Costumes, Best Song for ""Come What May"" and of course best movie and director.I predict they will all be nomanited but, i'll like to see the movie that can top it!",Moulin Rouge!

1223,theproducersdaughter,Fantastic!!!,10,20 June 2001,"This movie taught me many things including NEVER TRUST REVIEWS!!!! Most reviews of the Moulin Rouge said that Baz Luhrmann pushed this movie too much. I thought that it was perfect. This movie is high on color and high on energy. ""You will leave the theater feeling exhausted"" People magazine said. This is completely false. You will leave singing your favorite tunes of the movie hoping that one day you will be as much in love as Satine (Kidman) and Christian (McGregor). (Well, thats what I felt) This is a must-see for everyone!! This movie has it all: love, suspense, tragedy and above all MUSIC!!!! Go see Moulin Rouge for a spectacular movie experience.",Moulin Rouge!
1224,k_perry0325,Great vision!,10,9 August 2004,"This film was yet more proof of Baz Luhrmann's great vision in music and movie-making. His music is so deep, you can't help but be drawn into it. I believe this movie has set a new precedent for musical films. I don't know about the rest of you, but I hope with all of my heart that Baz Luhrmann keeps making films and beautiful (to put it mildly) music. I also hope with all of my heart that someone out there keeps Ewan MacGregor singing. Why did it take so long to get that gorgeous voice and man out there in this kind of role?!?! His singing gives me the shivers (yummy kind). Keep it up, Ewan MacGregor! Another good one, but not as good as Moulin Rouge!, is ""Down With Love."" Ewan's acting in that, too, is delicious!",Moulin Rouge!
1225,Johnny Darklighter,"See this show, before it shuts down!!",9,27 September 2001,"'Moulin Rouge' is probably one of the best films I've seen all year. It's the cinematic equivalent to being tied to a four-poster bed, having your eyes pinned open, ala 'clockwork orange' and having a mixture of honey, sugar and vaseline smeared over your eyeballs whilst Nirvana and Elton John let off fireworks just behind your ears. Lovely!! The screen chemistry between Obi Wan and Kidman is hot, hot, hot. They can both sing (Ewan struggles sometimes but I think that just adds to the movies charm) If I've got any criticism it's that, the film is predictable and, like Jim Broadbents paunch, it does start to sag a bit towards the end. In all though, I thoroughly recommend it, for pure escapist entertainment. Finally, I've got to applaud Mcgregor and Kidman for tackling these parts, it's this kind of diversity that sets them apart as two of the best actors around at the moment. Hats of to Baz Lurman's outrageously over the top direction. Every scene could be framed and placed lovingly above your fireplace. It really is *cliche alert* a rollercoaster ride of a film. Get on board!! See this show, before it shuts down!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1226,jessbarga,About as classy and dazzling as Skankilera & Lil' Kim in the video,1,28 March 2002,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this odious.  I appreciate musicals; I am not opposed to vulgarity or exaggeration; I like Bowie and Madonna as much as the next guy.  But after being barraged with this film's raunchy idiocy for about two hours, I was entirely desensitized to the costumes, the tolerable singing, the heroes' predicament.  Not even its mockery quotient made viewing it a worthwhile experience -- I was far too irritated to enjoy a good laugh.On the bright side, watching this atrocity will likely have the effect of making the other movie we rented last night seem brilliant in comparison. That movie is Legally Blonde.  In fact, this movie makes the film I had previously held to be the worst of all time look rather brilliant . . . that would be Urban Menace, in which Snoop Dogg plays ""an insane urban preacher bent on revenge.""  Oddly enough, though, that movie earned 1.8 stars on this website, and is #50 on IMDB's list of the 100 most poorly ranked films. Moulin Rouge, on the other hand, earned a respectable 8.1 at the time of this review.  Perhaps some scheming 12-year-old girl with a crush on Ewan McGregor wrote hundreds of reviews under different user names, and stuffed the ballot box?  I can only hope so.In retrospect I see that the horrifying spectacle that so offended me last year -- that is, Christina Skankilera, Lil' Kim, Pink and Mya prancing around in teddies and hotpants and wrecking a reasonably good LaBelle song -- was perfectly appropriate.",Moulin Rouge!

Whether or not you think this is ""your kind"" of movie, it is worth the $5, $7.50, $9, or $10 you may spend on it just to see a little of another person's imagination. It is a rare thing indeed to be able to look at something and know you are seeing exactly what the person who made it was seeing.

1228,kgroves,Very Surprised,10,29 April 2002,"I was very surprised.  I was coerced into seeing this movie by various friends.  I thought I would hate it.  After seeing the video of the ""Lady Marmalade"" song, I was completely turned off to the notion of seeing the movie.  I really liked the movie, and am very glad that I saw it on the big screen.  In fact, I saw it as part of a friend's film class, and he said he was going to show the first three reels after his night class, and I went back to see the first part again.  The first hour of that movie was one of the most spectacular things I have seen on film.  I would urge anyone to see this movie.  I will agree that it is not for everyone, but one may be surprised by it like I was.  Since it is a musical, you have to give it a chance to be what it is.  People don't break into song like that, but it works here, like all good musicals.  It also goes from campy to serious to funny to sad, all in the space of a few minutes.  Most films don't seems to do this effectively.  This one does.  Again, I would urge you to see it if you haven't already.",Moulin Rouge!
1229,makemeabird,WOW!,10,9 June 2001,"This movie is so great!  The music, dancing, story-keeps you glued to the screen.  This is the first Nicole Kidman movie that didn't make me sick.

The way Luhrman has woven together a heart-wrenching love story with contemporary music and incredible design elements carries you away into a fantastical world.  It is set in 1899, but because Luhrman isn't obsessed with making it the traditional ""period"" it enables the audience to identify and suspend their disbelief. The well-trained, but not overly-crafted voices of Kidman and McGregor are refreshing.  The songs serve as an extension of their emotion, not a showcase of talent.  AS the story soars forward you find yourself laughing and crying, hoping and wondering at the characters and what they choose. It is a beautiful story, give it a chance!",Moulin Rouge!

After this, who but a preteen could sit though Grease or even Singing in the Rain. It destroys the old concept of a musical, but it may also set the bar so high that no one will ever make a serious musical again.It happened in art (painting), where all that is left is retreads and attempts to shock. This may be the last musical worth seeing for quite some time.",Moulin Rouge!
1233,destinys_angel-1,Flawless,10,15 July 2009,"Admittedly; I approached this film reluctantly. ""Historic/Romantic musical describing the short yet passionate fling of a writer and a cancan dancer, that stars a Scottish and Australian duo as the leads in a very French film that uses well known songs to create an artistic thriller?""- I thought.But don't miss out on this fantastic viewing experience. It hits every single note and it is just amazing.First it introduces you to the simple life of bohemian Christian and then it throws you headfirst into the promiscuous antics that take place in the Moulin Rouge, the courtier (Satines) place of work and residence. Then it reels you into a tale of epic love when these two worlds meet, through the young and talented pair (Christian and Satine). All is blissful until complications ignite, which are initially hilarious but ultimately heartbreaking.This film is a roller-coaster of genres; you'll be crying so heavily you won't believe that you were rolling around in hysterics ,mere scenes ago. Artistic, tragic, hilarious, musical and historical; This film is pleasing on so many levels that just watching it wont be enough, you'll have to Google it and download all the songs to your iPod. Forget R&B, Come What May and the Elephant Love Medley will be dominating your playlist.UNBEATABLE FLAWLESSNESS.",Moulin Rouge!
1234,thora,What a romantic dream of a movie,9,19 May 2001,"I'm not surprised that so many (not all) men don't appreciate this film. I'm not surprised that they obsess over the fact that they've heard the music before, over camera angles and other minutia.  Many men are like that. They can't let go and embrace sentiment.  Most are simply not capable.  How any ordinary movie goer or critic could see this movie and not be moved by the intensity of Christian and Satin's feelings for one another is beyond my comprehension.  When I saw the film, I was flabbergasted at how much attention had been paid to complaining about unimportant trifles.  Shocked that so many had proclaimed that Christian and Satin had no chemistry, I nonetheless sat enraptured whenever they were on screen together.  That so many could have watched this and felt nothing for the two lovers is a sad sign of just how jaded young people have become in this day and age.  It's SAD.  It's not surprising, though.  Critics panned ""It's a Wonderful Life."" What do they know?Ewan McGregor is a romantic the likes of which I haven't seen onscreen in many a year.  I thought I was jaded until I saw this film. What a voice on that man!!  I was thinking, ""Oh my goodness, that's Renton the toilet boy singing like Harry Connick, Jr.!!""   The girls beside me were swooning whenever he sang, as was I.  What a perfect wide-eyed innocent. That this actor can convincingly portray characters as diverse as Mark Renton and Christian is a testament to his phenomenal talent.   There aren't many actors who are his equal, and Nicole's star power should certainly be elevated by her charming performance.  What a cutie she is!!  One can understand why Christian was so captivated by her.As for the rest of the movie, what is everyone complaining about?  It was a wild, dizzying, gaudy, decadent spectacle of a ride--as Baz intended it to be.  This world was intended to be surreal to the extreme.  It wasn't meant to accurately reflect 1899 Paris.  Of course it wasn't!!! So you get a little dizzy, so what?  The ride was wild and the reworked music was a hoot. Let go and *enjoy*.  Are you all grumpy old men?   It's not often a movie stays with you like this.  It's the first truly great film of the year. Bravo Ewan, Nicole, Richard Roxborough and Jim Broadbent.  A 9 out of 10.

1236,hailstormand,Beautiful Chaos,10,2 July 2006,"I thought that this movie was another Hollywood offering; another weepy love story that I'd discard from my head as soon as the final credits roll up.I was never more wrong.From the moment the opening credits were presented - for how else do you describe it? A little man conducting an invisible orchestra with so deep a passion that you cannot help think it as ridiculous, the sombre opening, then the sudden jolt when time line is reversed, back to where it all began. And scenes after scenes edited faster than you can catch them - you'd think this was some sort of bad cinematic decisions they had made in the cutting room.But this movie got away with it, because it was a perfect fit for the whole scenario: I've never seen anything like it before, and like a child looking at a new specimen, I stared and stared and tried to take it all in as much as I could. It was chaotic to the extreme. Whoopi Goldberg said it succinctly during the Acadamy Awards: ""I guess Moulin Rouge! just directed itself."" It was a compliment, because I cannot imagine how did Baz Luhrmann direct such a feast for the mind and soul without breaking the whole story.In short, this is the revival of musical in the grandest scale ever.",Moulin Rouge!

1243,mrmarkgleason,One of the greatest films of all time!,10,21 March 2002,"Moulin Rouge! is in my opinion one of the greatest films ever made and I have never felt so strong about a movie. This story is about truth, beauty, freedom; but above all things, this story is about love. The movie is a classic for all times - It brings to light the hopes of all the dreamers in the world. The movie uses such splendid music to express the beautiful feeling of love. The movie is about love and it makes you fall in love! If you're a girl you are charmed by the smile of Ewan McGregor and if you're a guy you dive right into the eyes of Nicole Kidman. If you think they're ability to act is wonderful, they're singing is even better! I recommend you see the movie. If you don't like it the first time you see it, watch it again until you understand it. Nothing is greater than love, ""Love is like Oxygen, all you need is love!""",Moulin Rouge!

It was a disaster!!None of the actors have a chance to act at ALL.  Notice the sound effects? It was meant to be cartoonish, yet the very worst Loony Tunes cartoon has more style and sophistication than this film ... and you can empathize with the characters more!The use of contemporary songs is tacky, overdone, half-baked and badly executed; the voices of McGregor and Kidman are doctored to boost up their obviously sadly lacking vocal chords.Even if you accept that this film is MEANT to be unrealistic and ""spectacular spectacular"", it still fails to engage even on that level. Jurassic Park wasn't meant to have a great plot, but at least you could follow the superficial character motivations!  NONE of this film makes any sense -- nothing follows even the most basic logic or progression!This film is horrible, and is ultimately very VERY boring ... for all those ""escapetivists"" out there, if THIS is good, then my question is, what could possibly be worse?",Moulin Rouge!

Many people think Baz Luhrman's work is too odd and out of the box to enjoy, but that's just because Romeo + Juliet was so horrible.  Well, anything you held against Baz, forget about it.  Moulin Rouge is an excellent movie.  It is odd, and definately outside of the box, but it's the closest to perfect I've ever seen in a movie.  The music is so wonderful, you can instantly tell what the characters are feeling because it's familiar music!  Instead of writing a whole array of new songs, Baz just included the characters singing famous songs.  That may sound cheesy, but it works amazingly well.  Of all movies I've seen, none have portrayed true love this well.  In our modern world of one-night stands and divorces, it'll seem corny, but if you watch with an open mind, you'll see how perfect love is embodied in Moulin Rouge (ironic, considering the movie is about a brothel turned theater).  There's not much more I can say that hasn't been said already.  Just make sure you see it, preferably in theaters.10/10",Moulin Rouge!
1248,nulliusnominus,A pathetic pastiche of half-baked ideas,1,24 May 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a massive waste of time and money, and you should waste neither of yours on it.It is all at once juvenile, under developed, terribly scripted, poorly acted, woefully unfunny, singularily unsexy and, most importantly of all, hideously directed by someone who, time and time again, demonstrates that he doesn't know when to take his foot off the accelerator.What constantly amazes me is that such ridiculous out of control rubbish as this is seen as an example of some sort of new cinema. It isn't. It's just bad cinema. Baz Lurhmann has, like lots of other ambitious amateurs, a sort of ""horror vacui"". He has absolutely no comprehension of what to leave out, so he just throws it all in an attempt to cover up the fact that he doesn't know what he is doing.Please, please, please if you enjoyed this swill, watch the following as some sort of remedial treatment course to see what the TRUE masters of glorious excess are capable of. Watch Busby Berkeley. Watch Vincente Minelli. Watch Ken Russell (anyone who sniggers at that suggestion yet can still embrace Lurhmann is kidding themselves). Watch Dennis Potter. Watch Bob Fosse. Watch (selected) Alan Parker. Don't accept pale imitations!!!Above all, probably the biggest crime of this film is what could have been.

1249,Hellocello77,This film has run away with my heart,10,16 July 2001,"Despite what people have said about this movie, I am going to be steadfast and say that I LOVED this movie!.  The shrill camp keeps the plot amusing while the drama keeps it interesting by giving the movie chops.  This ""rhapsodic celebration of a cliche"" is absolutely wonderful and as a future music major, I thought that Nicole Kidman's and Ewan McGregor's singing was exceptional for the role.  (Kudos to the two of them for toughing it out and learning how to carry a tune along with my heart).  The characters Satine and Christian portrayed by Ms. Kidman and Mr. McGregor were extraordinary works that made me feel what they felt(In my opinion, all characters in all movies should do this).  The slap-stick ""drama"" of the Bohos, the gregariousness of Harold Zidler, and the sniveling wickedness of the Duke only add to the texture of the film.  I encourage anyone with a song in their heart to see this movie, and to buy the soundtrack right afterwards. Suggestion to Baz Luhrmann:  Make a second cd with all of the orchestral accompaniment and other left out misc. music on it.  I'm sure everyone wants a copy of Zidler's and the Duke's rendition of ""Like a Virgin""!All in all, this movie is on my personal top ten list as it should be on anyone else's.",Moulin Rouge!
1250,jeninmass,"flawed, yet remarkable",8,3 June 2001,"This movie, like its show-within-a-show, is spectacular in the original sense of the word.  It is a visual spectacle unlike anything else in recent memory.  Baz Luhrman is to be commended for pushing the boundaries of mainstream American film.  Regardless of any other qualities, this accomplishment alone makes this movie a must-see for film buffs.Luhrman is a risk-taking filmmaker if there ever was one, and as such he is bound to make a few mistakes.  The movie drags at the end, unable to keep up the fast-cut, MTV-style frantic pace of the first two-thirds.  McGregor's character, while inherently likeable, is perhaps not such a great writer, as his narration grows increasingly cliched and saccharine.  Nevertheless, McGregor and Kidman have created characters that the audience cares about and will root for, and so it is not difficult to stick with the film through its flaws.The use of popular songs, often in unexpected ways, is arresting and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.  This humor is a strength of the movie, as this film would have fallen flat on its face had it taken itself too seriously.  The music is done very well with sharp choreography and surprisingly good--even excellent--vocals.  In particular, the 'Roxanne' sequence is magnificently performed and edited.While there are moments in which 'Moulin Rouge' flounders, it more than makes up for it in its visual allure and boundary-pushing style.",Moulin Rouge!

An indescribable blend of music, fantasy, gripping reality of love and life, and an almost accurate portrayal of love...",10,5 July 2001,"I have seen this film several times since it's opening, and, if finances and time allowed, would see it several more.  It's an amazing look at the beauty, freedom, truth, and, above all things, love, as the advertisements describe it.  Nicole and Ewan give their masterpiece performances here, being a triple threat, and it's a vehicle that showcases both talents' more than their past projects.  I wasn't a particular fan of the director until I saw this one, but will now follow his career.  I know this isn't exactly a review, just some gushing at a film I'm in awe of.  I couldn't recommend this movie high enough. Cheers!",Moulin Rouge!

I am trying to coerce the world into seeing this film!  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they can SING!  Often called a cross between ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Titanic,"" it is really true. Destined to be a cult classic.  So few films can successfully pull off such a sharp shift in tone.  The first 45 minutes or so is a complete farce, high camp.  Then it slowly down shifts until the end is deep tragedy.  And yet it works.  The music, the costumes, the performances, the story, the script, the visuals... it all works!!  It is almost like seeing a theatrical production. The film opens and closes with the opening and falling of a stage curtain, and some musical numbers are so elaborately staged that everytime I have seen it (three so far) the audience bursts into applause!A MUST SEE!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1253,jam8317,The best film I've seen all year!,9,2 June 2001,"En route to the opening night of Moulin Rouge, I got depressed over the (lack of) quality of the film's I had seen thus far in 2001.  But after the two-hour showing of Baz Luhrmann's remake of the musical, I had new hope for the future of cinema.  It was hands-down the best picture I had seen in years.I know not everyone will agree with my assessment.  If you didn't like Luhrmann's last flick, William Shakespeare's Rome + Juliet, you won't care for this one either.  The plot it highly predictable, especially since it's presented in flashback form and the ending is revealed in the opening scene. But that's what makes it enjoyable, as you can just sit back and enjoy the technicolor fantasy.  And Luhrmann doesn't hold anything back there, using both black and white and ""brown-toned"" film stock to contrast his brilliant colors, particularly of the color red. If the costuming and color scheme aren't enough to bedazzle you, however, the music will.  Kidman has a surprisingly good voice, and McGregor's is amazing.  But it's the songs themselves that will really get to you.  A short list of the songs includes Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" The Police's ""Roxanne,"" Elton John's ""Your Song,"" and a rousing rendition of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin""--sung by the Moulin Rouge's impressario, Jim Broadbent, no less.  In one scene McGregor and Kidman cite the lyrics to a dozen love songs.This movie is the product of an MTV culture, and those from the older generations won't be the ones flocking to the theaters.  If you liked the style of Romeo + Juliet or the wittiness of Shakespeare in Love and you're up for a different kind of film, this one's for you.",Moulin Rouge!

And then that love story, I have not cried at a film for a long time.  I think the style was perfect for that atmosphere with all the colors that Baz Luhrman likes to use.

It completely absorbed every part of this moviegoer's heart, mind and soul. It even did so for a short time after the film had finished, quite an uncommon feat.Nicole was beautiful. Ewan was nice.

1257,stotlerjen,Luhrmann has done it again!,10,5 June 2001,"I have to say I am a little biased-Luhrmann's Strictly Ballroom is my favorite movie.  So I expected a lot from Moulin Rouge and thankfully was not disappointed.  I can easily see how someone could be turned off by this movie.  It really wasn't advertised as a kinetic, quickly-paced musical. So if you weren't expecting that, it would be a shock.  And if you're looking for something like Pearl Harbor or Mummy Returns-DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE.  To me though, this movie was spectacular!  Ewan McGregor has long been a favorite and he displayed his tremendous talent once again as Christian. Who knew he had such a dreamy voice?  I think I audibly sighed when he started singing Your Song.  In the past I have not liked Nicole Kidman in the least, but she made me change my mind.  She was beautiful and was able to pull off the role of Satine nicely.  She was aloof one minute and charmingly in love the next.  I was enthralled by this movie the minute it started and was completely engrossed until the end.  I just can't wait to go see it again.",Moulin Rouge!
1258,DarkZophar,The Most Unique Film of the Year,10,6 June 2001,"I just got back from seeing the well-talked about ""Moulin Rouge"" with this review in mind ever since I left the theatre, and I have no idea to start. There's just too much swirling in my head about this very classy piece.I suppose I can start by saying that Moulin Rouge is one of the most unique, innovative, and original movies in recent years.Directed by Baz Luhrman (William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, Stricly Ballroom), and set in the end of the 19th Century Paris, Moulin Rouge is the story of young Christian (Ewan McGregor) a writer in his first experiences in the Bohemian Underworld of Paris,  and the lovely Courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), a well-endowed showgirl of the infamous Moulin Rouge Club/Brothel, and their ill-fated love affair. However, the club manager (played by Jim Broadbent) signs over the deeds to Moulin Rouge and ownership of Miss Satine to the Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxbourgh) in exchange for his funding for the greatest show Moulin Rouge will ever produce, and thus begins the ever-twisting love story of this magnificent movie.The performances of Mr. McGregor and Ms. Nicole Kidman (who, I might add, has never looked more gorgeous then she does here) are to say the least their best yet. Their love is believable, it's real, through the way they portray the character's emotions. No fabrication here like you see in your average romantic film. Cheers also to the exceptional works of John Leguizamo and Jim BroadbentThis film is both a musical and a love story, and Moulin Rouge is like nothing I've ever seen in either regard. The music is very important in this movie. One of the first true musicals to come out just for the silver screen in many a year, it uses what is called Anachronistic Music, meaning songs that don't normally coincide with the setting of the movie nor would you ever hear that kind of music if you were actually there. You'll hear from the cast bits from and pieces of ""I'll Always Love You"", ""Roxanne"", ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", and even a full rendition of ""Like A Virgin"", as well as the fresh Operetta pieces, R&B, and Pop Singles made especially for the movie. The anachronistic music is used remarkably well, and it's one of the most innovative scores I've ever heard.The one thing that grabbed me over everything else is the cinematography and the setting design. Baz has quite a bit of fun with the camera with this one. There's a lot of coreography in the movie, and the camera becomes a dancer itself. You wouldn't expect a musical/love story to be such a visual tour de force, and I didn't expect it either, and it made me dizzy from time to time. He uses some nifty tricks such as pulling individual frames from the film reel (so that the film purposely hops and skips) and speeding up or slowing down the speed of the film, using both techniques together with the pace of the music. Concerning the setting, Baz has taken a somewhat realistic setting and turning it into a virtual fantasy world. He uses CGI rather for an artistic effect rather then for eye-candy like most films tend to show, and the result is a specacular world filled with illustration and imagination. The costumes, make-up, and set designs are incredibly elaborate, dazzling, and almost overdone. Truly one of the most beautiful films to come out in a long time.I can almost guarantee that Moulin Rouge will make an appearance at this year's Golden Globe and Academy Awards. Here's what I think it will show in- Nominations in Cinematography, Musical Score, Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Actor, Best Actress, and above all Costume Design.This is the first truly superb film of the summer, and quite possibly will be one of the best of the year. If you haven't already seen Moulin Rouge, do so as soon as you can. I wouldn't recommend it to a person with little appreciation for Avant Garde moviemaking, but I'd recommend it to everyone else.",Moulin Rouge!
1259,Ryan82,"Moulin Rouge is ""Spectacular, Spectacular!""",10,9 June 2001,"Anyone with an ounce of common sense, can see that Moulin Rouge is a fantastic movie.  Of everyone I have talked to most have said that it is a bad movie, but of everyone I've talked to that has actually seen the movie has agreed that it is a superb collection of music, acting and style.  The others have made their opinions based on the trailers shown to the public, and that is the only problem with this movie, the poor (and lack thereof) advertising.Some people complain that movie trailers show too much about the movie and end up ruining it for the viewer.  If this was what the Public Relations people from 20th Century Fox were trying to accomplish, then they have gone just too far.  First of all, the trailer does not even make it evident that this movie is a musical.   Secondly, there is no real clear indication of the plot.  The only thing that is clear is that it is held in the early 1900's by the costumes and scenery in the trailer.  This movie would have made much more money if the advertising was done better, and the only thing that can help bring in more money is the word of mouth of people who have seen the movie.The plot may be a typical love story, but the movie itself is far from typical.  Baz Luhrmann, is not only a director, but an artist.  His modern visions give the movie a uniqueness that makes it stand out and will make the viewer want to see it over and over again.  A big round of applause has to be given to Baz Luhrmann and Marius DeVries for their work on the greatest soundtrack I've heard in a long time.  The soundtrack is so good, that after seeing the movie I had bought the soundtrack the very next day when the stores opened, in fact I am listening to it now as I write this review.  People should not just see this movie because it is a good movie, but because it is so unique and different than most people are used to seeing. Very few directors and their movies ever break out of the molds that seem to constrain the rest.  Baz Luhrmann has already proved that he is able with his rendition of Romeo and Juliet and Moulin Rouge is no different. 
Overall, and in every small aspect, this movie is ""Spectacular, Spectacular!""",Moulin Rouge!

The film draws you in from the very beginning with it's exciting, visually stunning atmosphere. Ewan McGregor can sing very nicely, thank you and Nicole Kidman has a charming voice(somewhat like Olivia Newton-John's).  The movie alternates from High energy wackiness, to very high drama.  Moulin Rouge uses music from everybody from The Beatles to Madonna(""Like a Virgin"" is used in a scene that has to be seen to believed...a real hoot!).

Aside from a couple of slow spots the film is a visual feast for the eyes.  The colors, choreography, cinematography, costume design, set design, direction, and editing all combine to make it one wild ride.  I must also mention the treat for the ears.  Kidman and McGregor prove not only their acting merits but their vocal abilities!  McGregor throws himself into his character and sings his heart out.  The excitement and joy in his expression just make you want to believe!  There was one musical number that I was not expecting and I was completely overjoyed.

I was very unsure about seeing this movie, but reluctantly went to see it with friends.  I had no idea what it would be about.  Within five minutes I was loving it.  It is a whole new musical about love.  The songs were great, and I loved the use of many titles in the Elephant Love Medley.

""THE GREATEST THING IN LIFE, IS TO LOVE SOMEONE AND TO BE LOVED IN RETURN!!!""Throughout the centuries philosophers have tried to describe what life is about with thousands upon thousands of words used in each of their complex discourses. I wonder what the ancients would have replied to the moral stated here?

1265,drunken wastrel,"One to simply be enjoyed, rather than analysed (SPOILERS)",9,12 March 2002,"The reviews I have read on the subject of this film seem either to say ""This is the best film I've EVER seen"" (probably for around a week) or ""Anyone who felt anything other than total disgust at viewing this film is an imbecile"". I can see where both sides are coming from, and I think that aspects of both are true.Moulin Rouge is the kind of film that has the capacity to greatly inspire you, assuming you are willing to forgive its weak points (more on that below).  Its message is crystal clear and poignantly delivered ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn...""  I am not the kind of viewer who watches films searching for weak points to make disparaging comments about at a later date, so the fact that I did sense that some aspects were not of the standard the remainder of the film deserves is proof that they are easily apparent.  However, I loved this film.  This was in spite of, or perhaps even because of, the several things that were bad about it.First, the good points.  Most undeniably the cast.  Nicole Kidman simply casts a spell as Satine (though for Gods sake stop her pouring emulsion over herself, or whatever the hell she does to get a distinctly unsexy white sheen on her skin), and Ewan McGregor, who has always seemed mildly annoying to me, also puts in a very good performance.  Jim Broadbent doesn't put a foot wrong as Zidler, Richard Roxburgh manages to pull off the trick of being both a caricature and occasionally exuding menace - the final scene with him advancing toward the stage brandishing a pistol had genuine ferocity about it -  and all the other supporting actors live up to expectations.  The one character who annoyed me throughout was ""Nini Legs in the Air"".  First of all, the woman is ugly.  Second, her spiteful comments to both the leads just made me want to slap the woman. I wasn't as annoyed as some by the constant changes in focus.  Perhaps I wasn't analysing it at a deep enough level to be greatly troubled by it, but after the mayhem of the first twenty minutes the cameraman appears to get his caffeine fix and reduce the jerking of the camera.  The direction was inspired, innovative, and a refreshing departure from the norm. I was also not troubled by the use of modern music, indeed in certain scenes it made the film.  My favourite scene, with the two leads serenading one another atop an elephant (ridiculous as it sounds), was touching, well choreographed, and exquisitely performed.Now the bad points.  Basically they all revolve around the one central problem - the plot.  Now fair enough, its not about the plot, blah blah, but basically, much as I enjoyed the ""Your Song"" scene, I couldn't see the two of them as a realistic couple.  So shoot me.  I loved the film, but its fundamental premise left me shaking my unashamedly idealistic head.Whilst I disagree that revealing the ending at the start was necessarily a bad thing, I do agree that the transparency of the plot inevitably lead to total predictability.  TOTAL predictability.  As in, after the first hour, I could have written detailed scene summaries for the second hour.That being said, I found Moulin Rouge to be a great film, extremely enjoyable, and able to be watched on multiple occasions with no reduction in that enjoyment.  I heartily recommend it to people with the ability not to delve too deeply into its underlying weaknesses, but to bask in the warm glow of its surface magic.  I don't know if its one of the best films I've seen in a while, but its definitely one of those I've enjoyed the most. An easy 9/10.",Moulin Rouge!
1266,mcganns,A TICKET TO RIDE,9,17 June 2001,"""Moulin Rouge"" is not just a movie. It's a rollercoaster ride. And a thrilling one at that. Baz Luhrmann has created a truly unique movie experience- You may love it or hate it but I urge you to buy your ticket, strap yourself in and keep your arms wholly within the car because you're in for an exhilarating ride.Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are just great, but it's the visuals that give this a whopping 9 stars. I haven't stopped thinking about this movie since I saw it (twice) 2 weeks ago. The one feature that has not been praised, to date, is the extraordinary original music written for the film. I hope that a second album is released that includes this, especially the end title music. Stunning!",Moulin Rouge!
1267,mors3953,Excellent for the deep in thought,10,20 June 2001,"The Moulin Rouge is a surreal image of Parisian life in the pre-1900's.  It embodies the surreal ideal in plot, filming, and music.  With an excellent performance by both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, this movie is not for everyone.  This movie is for those of you who can appreciate the surreal view and a deep ending.

It's one of those ""love it, hate it"" movies---I, personally, loved it.  All of my friends loved it; in fact, everyone I know that's seen it has loved it, a lot of them have and seen it twice. Compare it with Baz Luhrman's ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the sweeping, tragic, romance.  Compare it with an artsy music video for the cinematography. Then compare it with your Greatest Hits from the Last 30 Years CD for the soundtrack.  It's about 1/2 opera, 1/2 dialogue.  Imagine such songs as ""Your Song"", ""Roxanne"", and ""Like A Virgin"" as key scenes in the movie, only all songs tweaked to be ""broadway""nized. Ewan McGregor's performance is quite good, and his voice proves to be pretty decent, too. (I enjoyed his rendition of Elton John's `Your Song' better than the original!) Nicole Kidman is in a typical `unattainable goddess' role, with pretty good acting (not as impressive as McGregor's emotional performance), and with an I-Got-the-Lead-in-a-few-High-School-Musicals voice. Be prepared to be open-minded for the first 20 minutes (it's a little weird in the beginning), but to be delighted with the rest of the film. And BE OPEN MINDED! You should love it!",Moulin Rouge!

1272,Lord_Angelus,The Best Love Story In the World ! ! ! ! !,10,8 July 2001,The music and story is so nice. The music is so fast moving.

Ewan singing is so sweet.,Moulin Rouge!
1273,Y_E_,Very impressive.,9,11 July 2001,"In my mind, this movie gets two merits:1. That it was visually stunning, beautifully superficially appealing.  By that I mean the settings, cinematography, musical numbers, were all brilliant. 2.  That it had one of the most predictable, corny, rehashed plotlines I've ever seen, was full of romantic rubbish that would normally make a cynical type like me nauseous - and yet this was all pulled off so well, and with such skill, that I didn't even mind it.  (To say ""one of the most"", I admit though, is pretty unfair, considering the state of most efforts at movies nowadays - let's just say that it didn't particularly surprise me, and, at least theme-wise, didn't really seem to step out of the mold).So that would be my only grievance: Yes, the plot is corny, yes, the theme is simple, and the random-spontaneously-combusting passion that occurs between the two main characters is very cliche.  This one gripe aside, I will now try to express why the movie is worth seeing even despite this seemingly major flaw.The visual effects are to die for.  So many scenes just dazzle with color and beauty - every detail, from ridiculously lavish interiors and buildings down to the costuming, is breathtaking.  Definitely worth seeing on the big screen - it is a celebration of movement and color.It is filmed in an interesting and unique way - not so different as to alienate its viewers, the all simplistic general public - but a refreshing change from your everyday style.  Combine these with excellent choreography and the Moulin Rouge is a whirlwind of textures....a sort of living scrapbook is the only kind of way I can describe it.The singing is surprisingly good.  Kidman shines.  I didn't think too much of McGregor's voice, but he pulls it off well as well.  The inclusion of contemporary songs works so well, no one could even think of criticizing anachronism.The movie is cheesy: but when it's cheesy, it's glossed to perfection.  The love ballads are set in the stars, glitter and rosepetals galore, with big corny musical numbers inspiring emotion and awe despite themselves.And it's funny, too.  Spoofs galore - hilarious in contex.I don't know anything about excellent acting, so I won't presume myself informed enough to lecture you all on that.  But from what I, in my simple peasant ways, can see, Moulin Rouge is a fantastic effort.  The inherent ""cheesiness"" of the plotline is never evident; everything is believable, and earnest.  I don't think the plot has any major surprises, but the strands of the story are interwoven skillfully. It dazzles, enthralls, and flows beautifully....and worth every penny to see it in full glory on the big screen.Moulin Rouge has something for everyone, I think...innovative camera work for the film techniquers, visual splendor for the eye-candyists, lots of sparkles, music for the musical lover as well as the contemporary music lover - contemp. music placed so innovatively throughout the film, a heartfelt story for the romanticists, a comedy for those who want light entertainment.And even for cynics like me, always on the prowl to find originality and abuse cliches....for taking something so, so simple, and creating a great and enduring, and penultimately lovable film.",Moulin Rouge!

Now ""Moulin Rouge"" joins ""Top Banana"", starring Phil Silvers, as too unbearable to sit though to completion in the theater.

Its supporting characters extremely poorly written and many of the stylistic experiments don't quite work out. But why then is it worth watching time and time again? Its the closest we can see on a screen this far to true love being shown on screen. Its able to bring out the Bohemian in even the most cynical among us and though as a piece of cinema it may not go down as the greatest work it undeniably is a beautiful artwork of some kind and must be remembered as such so that we don't forget just why we continue to listen to silly love songs.",Moulin Rouge!
1277,creegah,"Simply, the worst movie ever made.",1,2 February 2002,"Where do I start? The awful miscasting of Ewan McGregor. The horrible music; like Lloyd Weber on a bad acid trip. Kidman's terrible lip-synching. Kidman's lack of stage presence. A story line which has been done a thousand times before, all better than this. Camera work which was like The Blair Witch Project, only in Technicolor (I kept reaching for my Dramamine). How did this movie EVER get financial backing? If not for the headliners, it would have run 1 week, max. Or stayed in the can forever. Where it belongs.",Moulin Rouge!

It does't work as a comedy(because it's not funny)not even a lame one, and drama?.....seriously?...I can only assume that the decision to use non singing actors to try and sing the horrible songs was done for comedic relief. So far I haven't spoken to anyone who liked this movie, and when it comes up as a rerun the offending channel is turned as soon as possible. The actors that were in this train wreck are good actors (but terrible singers), so the blame for this turkey probably lies with the director/producers.....who are probably saying to everyone now,""Well, we thought it was a good idea at the time."".....oh, and to top it off, this movie won an Oscar or two?.. that goes to prove that it's not the quality of the work, it's who you know in the business...btw, I am in the business...",Moulin Rouge!

Ordinarily the scores for the top movies peak at 8 or 9. Peaking at 10 is quite interesting, esp. when the average score is relatively low.Conclusion: you'll love it or you will regret having seen it.

1280,gjwarrilow,Classic Entertainment,10,26 July 2001,"The long wait was worth it.  After much secrecy during the filming here in Sydney, Moulin Rouge sprung to the screen to a very appreciative home town audience.  Whilst not being a huge Kidman fan, it was great to see her in the role of Satine and together with Ewan Macgregor made a great screen couple. In my opinion all the cast were faultless.This film was camp with a capital ""C"" and incredibly entertaining. Brilliant sets, costumes and an exceptional soundtrack with a clever use of the contemporary.  Ewan McGregors voice - wow!  It's not very often that I feel like singing along at the movies but with Moulin Rouge not only did I want to sing along, I wanted to get up and Can Can!So good to see the Australian film industry getting more acknowlegment worldwide through the success of such a film like Moulin Rouge.Sydney - the new Hollywood?

1282,Thunderstorm205,The Best Movie Ever moulin rouge,10,28 May 2007,"The Moulin Rouge is the most amazing movie ever. Its my favorite movie. The songs Are fantastic and i have been singing them in my head all day. Christian (Ewan McGregor), a gifted writer with an idealistic outlook on love, sets off for Paris . He moves into a lowly tenement right across from the notorious nightclub that is the Moulin Rouge, where girls do the can-can... and more. It is here where Christian befriends a dwarfish Toulouse (John Leguizamo), who wants to put on a musical production to further the Bohemian movement. He wants Christian to write it and have the most beautiful and famous star of the Moulin Rouge, Satine (Nicole Kidman), to play the lead. The ever-so-romantic Christian falls madly in love with Satine, but things get complicated when the wealthy financial duke of the production wants Satine for himself. Satine is torn between the two, but like a true actress, she knows that the show must go on.From the trailers, one would not think that ""Moulin Rouge"" is a comedy, but in fact, most of the film is. I was very much surprised how well this worked for the film, not only because we knew the lyrics and could sing silently to ourselves, but also these songs fit the situations perfectly. I was totally absorbed by the film's amusing absurdity. There were original numbers written for the film, which were also good, but it will be the ones that are recognized that will be remembered. Nicole Kidman was great as Satine, and I also admired Ewan McGregor's performance. Credit is to be given to anybody who can act as well as Kidman. Despite a bit of a shaky start, ""Moulin Rouge"" regains control and maintains it for the rest of the film. It is an enjoyable surprise that will make you laugh and sing along. Go check out this movie if you can-can.",Moulin Rouge!
1283,walter98,Sleeper alert!,8,21 August 2001,"If you are a fan of musicals, don't miss this film! Nicole Kidman turns in what I argue is the best performance of her career.

1284,kbenson-1,Breathtaking,10,5 September 2001,"Ultra-romantic, operatic in the grandeur of its ambitions, gorgeous to look at, musically astounding, witty and exuberant, endlessly inventive, and loads of fun, Moulin Rouge floored me. I don't think I have enjoyed a movie as much since my childhood, meaning that it transported me out of this world into its own unique universe the way Saturday matinees (didn't matter what was playing) did when I was a child. (This is not to claim that Moulin Rouge is as great as, let's say, Grand Illusion; but there are different kinds of masterpieces.) Kidman and McEwan are both splendid and of course both are splendid to look at. The supporting cast is uniformly superb, John Leguizamo especially endearing as Toulouse Lautrec. Sets, costumes are a delight. The film's musical director and whoever did the orchestrations/arrangements should both win the Nobel Prize in Music (if there were such a prize); musically Moulin Rouge is an absolute tour-de-force. I certainly can understand why some people might hate this movie (those, for example, with no sense of romance or humor; or those who find opera or, say, musical theatre, inherently ridiculous). And I know it's a much over-used word . . . but Baz Luhrmann is clearly a genius.",Moulin Rouge!
1285,theatrechick4490,A musical of a different color,7,26 December 2006,"I must say that I never saw this movie when it was in theaters but it was on demand last night so being bored i decided to order it and watch. It was brilliantly done but I can see where the negative reviews come from. The camera spins and created dizzying shots in which colors and shapes blend with pop songs such as Like a Virgin and Diamonds are a girls best friend. I would still suggest seeing it because I have seen nothing like it.....as some mentioned earlier it would probably be a good spring board for getting someone into musical film and theater. On a side note, I had no idea that Ewan McGregor could sing so well nor Nicole Kidman for that matter, they alone make it worth enduring the film.",Moulin Rouge!

1288,patchdyer,A love-it-or-hate-it experience. I hated it.,1,9 May 2011,"I just saw MOULIN ROUGE! the other night on Netflix and I thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Completely self-indulgent, contrived, soulless, and pretentious. And yet people keep calling it one of the greatest movie musicals ever. It's literally all style and no substance.There were many things about this movie that annoyed me so I'll try and keep it to a minimum.1) The plot: I've never seen a romance in a movie that felt so fake as in MOULIN ROUGE. Kidman and Gregor have no chemistry on screen but to be fair that's probably more of the director's fault then theirs. They keep saying crap like ""love will shine through"" or ""love will conquer all"" or the popular ""the greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return."" Give me a break. I literally counted how many times they said ""love"" in this movie and it was 126 times. (Although I may have lost count during the Madonna number when the chorus sings ""Love!"" a dozen times every 5 seconds.) The love that this movie babbles on about isn't real love. It's formulaic, planned, polished, and fraudulent Hollywood romance. The relationship between the writer and actress never felt true because whenever their relationship was in danger, it was because the one-dimensional Duke threatened, never the two in love. That Duke only exists to the convenience of the plot. Real problems in a relationship come from the lovers like their personalities, life choices, etc. There's more to love than just pure romance. It's about getting past problems and working through them instead of just waiting around and doing nothing hoping that ""love will conquer all"" in some clichéd climax. There are better romance films out there (musical and non) that actually show real love like CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND, CABARET, LOST IN TRANSLATION, and more.2) The characters: These people seemed so non-existent. In fact, the characters in this movie weren't characters; they were set pieces that could move around, sing badly, and make stupid faces at the camera. There are great actors in this movie like Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, and Jim Broadbent; yet, director Baz Luhrman favored their costumes and bedrooms more than their acting. A real shame and a real waste of potential.3) The editing: Based purely on this aspect, I believe MOULIN ROUGE! was made for people with severe ADD. Not one shot lasted more than 3 seconds. All it is is just people mugging at the camera as it zooms from one room to the next. It's as if Luhrman is afraid that the actors will distract from the movie's style so he yells CUT!! right before the actors summon a real emotion. Characters should never be upstaged by the visuals; the visuals are there to add to them and the story. Ironically, this MTV-style approach actually hurts the movie's look because we can never get a good look at the amazing art direction. These sets are fantastic! Let us see them! 4) The music: My friends kept telling me how brilliant and innovative the soundtrack is and when I saw the trailer I thought I was going to adore it. But when the McGregor character first sang ""The Hills are alive with the Sound of Music!"", I groaned thinking to myself, ""Great, it's a jukebox musical."" For those who don't know, a jukebox musical is a musical that uses already existing music for its ""score."" It's damaging Broadway right now with shows like American IDIOT and preventing musicals to move forward artistically. It should be used as an homage to great composers and their work, but nowadays it's just a cheap move to enhance album purchases. I guess in MOULIN ROUGE it's supposed to show how love is universal in all kinds of music but it makes the movie seem anachronistic. Plus, if a movie like MOULIN ROUGE is going to have this much hype around it, it better have original songs. Some people say ""Come What May"" is the only original piece but I've done some research and it apparently was used for Luhrman's previous film, ROMEO+JULIET. It wasn't even written specifically for MOULIN ROUGE. (It's an awful song anyway.) I can't stand it when people praise this soundtrack because there's nothing really brilliant about simply rearranging and orchestrating existing pop songs and having them sung horribly. (Kidman is not a singer! Why is she used in this and NINE?!) 5) The directing: Pretty much everything I've complained about is because of Luhrman's direction. People wonder why he never got an Oscar nomination for Best Director. It's because he didn't care about the story or characters, only the sets and costumes. It's actually kind of amazing how much he didn't care. There's no sense of pace, subtlety, or consistency. There's nothing wrong with trying to make your movie look spectacular. But if your story and characters fall flat, then the images just become something nice to look at and dissolve from the audience's memories once the movie's over. There's got to be something else that gives the film its drive other than clothes, art direction, and choppy editing.Well, that's all I can think of for now. Hopefully I didn't rant too much. Obviously I'm in the minority but that won't change my opinion. But who knows? Maybe I'm just ""missing something."" I just wish people would acknowledge and admire real musicals instead of a collection of pop songs pretending to be musicals.",Moulin Rouge!
1289,monkeyzoe,"Erm, not bad, not keen on Nicole though",6,12 September 2001,"This has got to be a film you either love or hate.  I went in there thinking it would be great and fantastic (my boyfriend went in thinking he would hate it).  I came out cold and he came out jumping for joy.  I knew I was hating it as soon as I started looking at my watch.  If I love a film I don't care about the time, but I was clock watching.  I didn't enjoy the start of it. Everyone was OTT.  It was everywhere.  I understand that it was supposed to be a crazy time.  It did my head in.  One could argue, it is a musical and it is a theatrical piece.  Bobbins!  It still was trying too hard at the start.  Got to say that Nicole made a good entrance, but for some one with Consumption, she had a good set of lungs on her and looked well.  As if! Do you know, but when I was little I always thought that Consumption was something that people who ate too much food got.  Anyway, that aside.  I like how they did new songs in the old setting, but I hated how they kept enveloping different songs into each other.  And (perhaps it's because I'm a female and it is the law that females end up hating female leads if they are very beautiful), but I felt no sympathy for Nicole's Satine.  I just couldn't wait for her to die.  She was a completely cold character that was not sold on me at all.  I thought that John Leguzi-whats-his-face was fab at Toulouse Lautrec and the Narcoleptic was a great part also.  I preferred Romeo+Juliette and Strictly Ballroom.  They wiped the floor with this film. Perhaps it's just me not ""getting"" it, but it was not the best film I saw this year.",Moulin Rouge!
1290,stefanocasali,What cinema is all about!,10,13 September 2001,"A bleary evening in London was threatening at which point the idea of seeing Moulin Rouge was cast in my direction.  Not having heard much of it, knowing about the famous night-spot in Paris and having seen a less than invigorating trailer left me a little unsure.  I gave into peer pressure and we took our seats.From the very beginning of this movie I was hooked. It was the saline in my cinematic drip from minute one to minute 127.  Left brain-dead by the usual Hollywood fare, this rocked me into consciousness and had me by the short and curlies all the way through.You can read elsewhere the details of the plot, so I'll refrain from a refrain, but if you are after an all-out cinematic assault in the way cinema was intended, then you need to see this movie.  Not only is it a welcome break from the more moronic Hollywood releases of, well, most of the time, it is a genuine emotional rollercoaster and visual triumph.  Mash that in with glorious pastiche, sharp wit, spellbinding set dressing, photography and choreography and you have a real treat.Don't be put off by the fact that it is a musical.  It is a musical triumph. In fact everything worked so well that I was left floundering in my seat until the end of the credits, as was nearly everyone else in the cinema.

All my expectations came true, and became overruled by this movie. This experience is one I'll never forget. This isn't just a story about love or a romantic comedy. This film is a masterpiece filled with visual miracles and breathtaking music. The singing voices of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor surprised me, they sound great! By the way, not only the film, the soundtrack is also a wonderful album. I think Baz Luhrman is one of the most innovative 'visualist' in movie-land!

I never thought that a musical (I think that is what they call such movies) could appeal to me so strongly, none to say a love story. Moulin Rouge was imho the best love story I have ever had the privilege to watch. Many of them are typical, only the scenery changes. Here the scenery is blown to such shocking contents that you feel as if being in a theme park of some sort. And it's not a crappy theme park. After a movie, besides the ""feel"" of it I always try to analyze it's good and it's bad points. After Moulin Rouge I could not find any weak points. The directing was great (thx Buz :), the acting (I could not imagine a better line up, all the roles were great), the COSTUMES, the scenery, the drama! I hope you won't take me for a freak but I just came back from THE SHOW and I'm still hot over it.You will have many great moments while watching this movie, from mad laughter, through sadness, despair to contemplation.

1295,benzin,When was the last time a movie made you cry?,9,8 May 2002,"No movie _ever_ has made me feel as strongly as this one. An enormous catharsis, that's what this movie is. The strongest of feelings: love, sorrow, jealousy, etc. Absolutely everything in this movie just fits in, from the ultra modern camera action to the themes that are as old as man himself.The basic story is actually a very shakespearenian tragedy - reminding of Shakespeare In Love and the most recent version of Romeo And Juliet (which was, by the way, directed by the same man than this one). From the opening scene it's obvious that there will be no happy ending on this one, and the whole plot could very well be crafted by Shakespeare himself.Also this is a musical, in a way it follows the footsteps of many former musical classics, like Singing In The Rain for example. But most of all this is A MOVIE, an audiovisual experience at it's best! Very rarely, if ever has there been such a collaboration between the direction, cinematography, acting, music, and script as in Moulin Rouge! Watching this movie was like taking a giant load off my back, it somehow freed me of any bad thoughts I had, a catharsis as I mentioned.Besides, this movie made me cry, a thing no movie has accomplished in at least ten years, and that really is a compliment from a movie freak like me!",Moulin Rouge!

When I watched this movie for the first time, I was thinking that it was OK. But then I watched it again and I loved it. But to most people this movie seems weird, not to me. It wasn't weird at all, to me it's just ""Spectacular"".There are many reasons why I love this film. Here are all of my reasons for loving this film. I liked the first half of the film a lot because it's very fast paced. The second half of the movie is when the drama kicks in and still very good. I loved most of the songs that are sung by Ewan McGregor & Nicole Kidman. Finally I think Nicole Kidman & Ewan McGregor are perfect in this film, their acting and singing are just amazing!!.And now the downfalls of Moulin Rouge! since I liked ""Satine"" so much, I didn't like that at the end of the movie she dies. Well, that's it.Overall I'd highly recommend for you to watch this movie, that is if you want to see a great romantic drama that's also a musical.

You want a dying courtesan caught in a love triangle? Try the opera Madama Butterfly, or the hit musical Miss Saigon. You want a heroine dying of consumption in a bohemian atmosphere in Paris? There's this opera called La Boheme I highly recommend. The cabaret singer who falls for the poor writer? Watch the movie/musical Cabaret. The entrepreneur who toys with the affections of his starlet? The black-and-white classic Twentieth Century with John Barrymore will suffice. And not only is it the most derivative movie ever made, the acting was ridiculously bad. Ewan McGregor's crying when Nicole Kidman died actually made me laugh out loud. Sounded more like he was struggling with a hairball. And Kidman can't touch Liza Minelli as the singer in Cabaret. That this pitiful excuse for a movie is even considered to be in Oscar competition with such a staggering, incredible cinematic achievement as Lord of the Rings is a travesty.",Moulin Rouge!
1301,LoeGreen,They could as well write some music for this musical,1,22 December 2001,"This film develops along a plot that is as cliche, naive and predictable as is cinematographically possible, with most secondary characters bordering on the ridiculous ( Lautrec's ghost should sue the producers ). And that's not all - Ewan McGregor is the British equivalent to Keanu Reeves, totally uninteresting to watch, his expression of emotions and complexities coming out completely forced and shallow ( and singing worst than the average guy on the street ). But anyway, none of it should matter since this is after all a musical, right ?  Well, it is here that things really fall apart. The idea of transforming well known tunes to songs for the Moulin Rouge proves funny on occasion, but generally the songs are worst than the original tunes and there is absolutely no worthwhile original music for the viewer to associate with the movie. No tune to whistle back home or remember the next day's morning. The camera work is mostly awful - it moves so fast in the club scenes that one is never left with any images of dancing or with any rythm, just a mixture of sounds, colours and movement that supposedly provides for the ""crazy"" atmosphere, I guess, but comes out tiresome and boring.So we have a musical that is not funny but mostly annoyingly ridiculous, the music leaves us with no impression and no dance to watch and enjoy ( apart for the Spanish dance scene which is rather indifferent ). Then, of course, there is Nicole - she is gorgeous, sings surprisingly well and acts wonderfully, but all in the wrong movie I'm afraid.",Moulin Rouge!
1302,vicki_carter,Unbelievably fantastic I have seen this film over 30 times,10,23 December 2001,"The costumes were breathtaking, all of the actors were adorable, I actually felt the romance and fell in love right along with the lovers. The music was the best part.  I was so captivated by Ewan McGregor's voice that I kept running back to see this film over and over.  Nicole Kidman was more beautiful than ever and her voice!  I was very impressed with all of the music, the actors, the setting, and the fun I had watching this movie. I loved every minute of it. Although I have seen this movie more than 30 times, each time was still fresh. It touched me very deeply.  I can't wait to see it again.",Moulin Rouge!

A spectacular show of colour and music, with amazing fast-track editing, out-of-this-world scene design, and a wonderful cast of talented support roles. I must admit - when the movie came out, I had no intentions of ever seeing it. I was sure it would not be my cup of tea. But oh! how wrong I was!! From it's first cinematic line the movie takes you thtough a fantastic journey of cabaret and nostalgia. It is sweet, queer, and funny. Kidman is full of wit and shine, and in all - it is the most glamorous film I've seen in quite a long time. It seems to be made by people who love anything about the cinema - for people who love everything about the cinema. Enjoy!!!",Moulin Rouge!

I have watched it at least half a dozen times, without leaving the room. I have to admit i didn't want to see it, i thought it would be a cheap movie(prostitutes), but it was terrific. The acting, singing, sets, etc. all excellent. I even have the audio, which i play all the time, my friends are tired of listening to me sing(I sound terrible). Go rent this movie. A must see.",Moulin Rouge!
1305,rjacobson,One of the worst films I have ever seen,1,4 January 2002,"The critical acclaim for this abomination boggles my mind.  The casting is atrocious (fresh-scrubbed Nicole Kidman as the sensual, consumptive Satine?), the deliberate anachronisms (the Sound of Music?  Elton John?) are a pathetic and woefully inadequate substitute for creativity, and the singing stinks.  What's to like?",Moulin Rouge!
1306,robertpearson,Not my cup of Earl Grey,5,13 January 2002,"This film is an exercise in excess. Visually, it's like a gourmet meal that just keeps coming and coming and coming, long after you're full to bursting and writhing in digestive agony. Zoom in to the window, zoom out from the window, zoom in again, zoom out again...So much red velvet and crepe you begin to pray for a touch of green. Most of the songs fit into the movie the way Rush Limbaugh fits in at an NSync concert. The principals can sing in a highly tutored, competent sort of way, but don't exactly bring Judy Garland or Gene Kelly to mind. Nothing about this movie really had any effect on me. I couldn't care less about the characters or their love story. It seemed to be trying to be ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Titanic"", and a bit of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" to boot, without ever really achieving any of it. If you loved this film I'm very happy for you, but it felt more like 228 rather than 128 minutes to me.",Moulin Rouge!
1307,jld_124,"Watching this film, I wore a stunned look of amazement on my face.",1,21 March 2003,"I just didn't expect any movie to be so bad.  I will never believe the critics and the academy awards people again.  I like musicals, and this was an insult.  Is it trying to revitalize the musical, spoof musicals or kill the musical dead so it never sings another note?  No original songs, just borrowed lyrics.  Kidman isn't one of the greatest actresses out there but this is her all time worst.  I liked her in the others though.  Direction for this film, well, it gave me a headache, style over substance.  Weak plot. Jesus Christ Superstar kicks this films a$$ a hundred times over. See that if you want to see a good musical.  West side story's pretty good too. But whatever you do stay away from Moulin Rouge.",Moulin Rouge!
1308,randomizmatrix,Unique and Brilliant,10,14 January 2002,"This movie takes the classical tragic love story and tells it in a unique and beautiful way.  The colors, the drama, the dizzy wonderment really captures you in the film and causes you to feel the good and the bad with the characters.  (And though it is a love story guys - it is NOT a chick-flick)  Pure genius to use Madonna, The Police, Nirvana and many more in a film taking place in 1900 Paris and actually make it work.  To appreciate Moulin Rouge, you have to over look a seemingly simplistic plot and dialogue and enter into a fantastical world of music, dance, color and unique cinematography.  In film style it reminds me of a combination of Brazil and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (a bizarre combo I know). I am in love with this movie and have been recommending it to everyone (something I rarely do).  Watch it, enjoy it!",Moulin Rouge!
1309,pulse_bhs,No movie has ever affected me like Moulin Rouge,10,26 June 2010,"When I was a naive little thirteen year old girl and not the avid movie watcher I am now, Moulin Rouge was definitely the cream of the crop,untouchable, and the most moving film I'd ever seen. It shook me from the core so much that it occupied my mind for at least 6 months straight during all hours of the day. Yes I was that obsessed that my whole life revolved around scheduling viewings of Moulin Rouge to watch and laugh and cry and be utterly captivated by every moment of this movie.8 years later I am now deeply aware that this is a flawed and rather shallow movie but to deny the effect this movie had on me would be blasphemy. I still adore the soundtrack but now in a way adore the original songs more I still watch it from time to time but now I would probably describe my favorite movie as Two Lovers, Saving Private Ryan, Memento or Nightmare before Christmas, though no movie has ever left me as breathless as this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1310,eliblack,Makes Battlefield Earth look like Academy Award material.,1,15 January 2002,"Like Titanic, this was one of those movies that female friends had suggested was good, but that I intended to go to my grave having not seen.  However, someone put it on at a little get-together, so rather than be completely neurotic and leave, I stayed to watch.God how I regret it.That's two hours of my life I want back.  The only good points I could pick out were that the sets (when you could see them) and the costumes.  Both seemed quite well done.  Actually, if you removed the script and the cinematography, I suppose it wouldn't be such a bad movie.  But those two ruined it for me.  The camera angles were so jerky and uncoordinated I felt sick, and the plot was incredibly bizarre and didn't make sense until at least half way through.  And the final nail in the coffin that would make me recommend this movie only to people I hate is that they used SOUND EFFECTS for the characters' movements.  Seriously, cartoon sound effects.Want a historical semi-funny romance? Get Shakespeare in Love.  Want to be sickened by bad camera angles, nauseated by the neurotic acting, and just plain irritated by the general reek? Then by all means, I wholeheartedly recommend Moulin Rouge.",Moulin Rouge!
1311,womancritic,Frenetic fun.,3,24 January 2002,"This is the antithesis of the so called ""serious"" American movie- I had the odd joy of seeing it the day after I saw that ridiculous piece of Junk ""IN THE BEDROOM"" (avoid).  Moulin Rouge is a joy from start to finish, but a bit like eating junk food. You know it's bad for you even as you gobble it up. Fast paced to the point of incomprehensibility, this movie is a visual feast. Enjoy it for the moment. 7 out of 10 stars.",Moulin Rouge!
1312,emabrooks,One of my Top Ten's,10,12 June 2007,"I had avoided seeing Moulin Rouge simply because I heard that it was a ""musical"". I soon seem to forget that I DO in fact like ""musicals"" (Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory). So, for a year, I avoided the movie altogether. If it weren't for a good friend of mine INSISTING on seeing the movie, I probably would have missed out on this wonder! I am so glad I listened. I never knew how talented Ewan McGregor was (I am now a HUGE fan, he is adorable!), and though I have always loved Miss Nicole, she was stunning throughout the movie. My favorite scene is the duet they have in the elephant (the first of many). I have never been sucked into a movie like this one. You feel what they feel. You ""feel"" their love, and sorrow. Its beautifully done. I was very upset when Nicole Kidman did not win the Academy Award for this film. The acting is believable and ALL of the singing IS done by those starring and NOT dubbed. Everyone who worked on this film put their hearts and souls into it, and it shines through. It opened me up to at least try on a few other musicals (Chicago, which I didn't like), and I am always looking for another film to make me feel like I did when I watch Moulin Rouge for the first time. I am highly looking forward to the release of ""Across the Universe"" this summer. If you had doubts about seeing this film, try it out. You won't be sorry that you did.",Moulin Rouge!
1313,StitchFL,"With wonderful production values, who needs an interesting story?",4,7 March 2002,"I really wanted to like this movie: clever sets, clever lighting, rapid edits, and it is very clever how ""modern"" songs are interwoven. Unfortunately the story is the usual hollywood recycled trash.The characters are flimsy, the story repeated a bajillion times before, and telegraphed in the first ten minutes of the film. An evil duke - oh my - how original and interesting. Two people who fall in love at first site - wow. Wacky sidekicks - golly.It's fun to look at, but again we have proof that hollywood assumes that money put into flash will hide the lack of substance.It's not horrible, but it is not as good as I wanted it to be.",Moulin Rouge!
1314,joelfunderburg,I just don't understand it.,3,11 February 2002,"I can, if I squint REAL hard, maybe, just maybe, see why people like this film.  This is one of those movies where your eyes are frantically searching for something to hold onto, but just can't find the ground.  Besides the visuals, the plot was also dry wall.  The love emotion deep inside I felt was the tickling of my gag reflex.  This movie is not for the faint of heart, nor should it be for anyone.",Moulin Rouge!

Finally a movie musical that isn't stupid or boring. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are perfect together. The songs are very creative and great. The editing sweeps you into the movie. There is nothing bad I can say about this film. Just go see it or rent the dvd in stores. I think Nicole should win Oscar for this role. Tom Cruise can go cry over loosing her because Nicole is so much beter than Penelope. This is Nicole's best role and one of the best movies in the last ten years. Baz give us more, more, more!

I was absolutely taken by surprise, this was like nothing I had ever seen before, and I have only nice things to say about it. Afterwards when I found out that all the singing was done by the actual stars I loved the movie even more. basically what I want to say is: ""go see it"" even if its the only movie you'll watch this year, because it's so worth watching.",Moulin Rouge!

It also tells the story in a type of genre long thought dead and only used in Disney cartoons - a musical. This movie is colorful in every way, from the lovesick and love obsessed Christian and the courtisan/singer Satine to the amazing costumes.  The cinematography in the movie was exquisite, my favorite use of the camera being near the beginning when you first enter the Moulin Rouge, it is used to make you feel disoriented, like Christian probably felt when he first entered the late 19th century version of Studio 54. In a movie about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and Love, you feel all of it. The Truth - This movie is sensual, uplifting, a definite ""Spectacular Spectacular."" The Beauty - Every thing about the movie is beautiful, from the setting and time ( late 19th century, paris france during the bohemian revolution) to the people, costumes, music...need I say more. The Freedom - You will feel free as your entranced by this story about the lovesick Christian in his attempts to free his first love, Satine, from the grips of the evil duke. The Love - You will love to watch this movie over and over again.  You will love to sing along with the characters in each of the amazing songs (Your Song, Elephant Medley, Come What May)  You will love being able to share the movie and its story with your kids, grandkids and so forth. You will just flat out LOVE this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1320,Angelsentdown18,A movie I walk away and can't say anything but I love that movie!!!!!,10,3 September 2007,I must say the first time I heard about it was from my sister and she said after five minutes she turned it off because it couldn't hold her interest.However I must admit I sat through the entire thing and this is possibly the best movie I have ever seen. The acting is amazing definitely one of Nicole Kidman's best roles yet.Then of course there is Ewan Mcgregor who not only is a talented actor but one heck of a singer as well. The music itself I found interesting because it was modern day mixed with another era. In the end the music is a big part of the film it shows the passion and the capability of these wonderful actors/actresses. I do hate that Satine dies in the end but I don't believe it would have worked any other way. I would recommend this movie to anyone as long as you have an open mind. It is simply incredible and very easily enjoyable.,Moulin Rouge!
1321,moosecomrade,I'll kill that sound guy.,8,3 April 2002,"I gave this movie an 8 because I'm convinced that I'd like it, at least, that much if I had been allowed to see it as it was supposed to have been seen. Unfortunately I ended up seeing it a very tired Sunday at 9 p.m. in a theater where the sound technician were either deaf, on dope or both.This movie is ... intense. Its imagery is intense as well as its sound. Therefore it became almost impossible to experience for me. On the other hand, I've never been much for musicals and Moulin Rouge is a musical on steroids. It's somewhat difficult to take the plot seriously when everybody's running around, singing everything. The scenes of the show at Moulin Rouge are almost tiring in their excessiveness.It's got humor, romance, music, sorrow and action but it misses at some point, trying to compress too much movie into too little space. Or maybe it's just that some songs are way too cheesy. Or maybe I'm just tired and grumpy. The point I'm trying to make is that, being such an intense film, you really need to have the perfect setting for it, or you will just not like it (like me).Oh, and one very big positive thing: They all actually sing their own songs. Without that the whole movie would just be laughable, at best.",Moulin Rouge!

1323,Dendros,"Seen it before, heard it before...now in even smaller pieces",1,17 October 2007,"I just do not understand the photographic intent in this film; the great dance scenes cut into tiny epileptic shreds, and the close-up face scenes intolerably slow, like the prelude of Tarkovsky's Solaris. Why the fast cuts? Is there a global lack of dancers today capable to keep a pose longer than a quarter of a second. In comparison Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers did their whole dance numbers in just one take, Mr Astaire was a perfectionist though. Still, it can be verified that face shots does not become more dramatic by time alone.Neither the characters of Satine, nor Christian manages to attract my sympathy, and the Duke is too plain; more like a clown. Maybe intentionally, but since this is a fairy tale, I would appreciate the villain to be more of a character.Finally a potpourri is a potpourri is a potpourri. Why not put some effort in giving this film its own music, instead of the mishmash of great love songs it ended up with. Waste your time on ""All that Jazz"" or ""Cabaret"" instead, at least they got an interesting plot.",Moulin Rouge!
1324,Satine the Hobbit,Simply Astounding,10,5 August 2002,"When this film first came out, I didn't hear much about it.  Once Oscar season started, it seemed as if I had lived in a hole.  Everyone was talking about this film.  I still hadn't seen it, and the only thing it was to me was competition for my favorite of the year, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."" However, about a month later, I finally saw the movie everyone had hailed for nearly a year.  It seemed as if everyone I knew had seen and loved this film. I rented it, and from the first moment it started, I was entranced.  Every moment of this film kept me hanging on, and sending me through a whirlwind of sights, sounds, and delights for every sensory part of my brain.  I truly believe that this may be one of the greatest artistic films of ourtime. I've been accused of being an ""artsy-fartsy"" person, so maybe that's just the artistic side of me talking.  But even if it is, there is not a single time when I have seen this movie that I have not been moved to tears, be it from the story or the beauty of the movie itself.First, let me address Ewan McGregor's performance.  Regrettably, the only thing I had seen him in prior to this was, ahem, ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.""  Imagine my surprise when the little Jedi belted out ""Your Song,"" a favorite of mine, and promptly caused me to melt into a puddle of shapeless goo.  I still swoon every time I hear his voice.  Who knew Obi-Wan could sing, on top of act the part amazingly?  Not I, certainly. Opposite him, I could have chosen no one better than the lovely and talented Nicole Kidman.  Definitive Satine?  YES.  Simple as that.  Her voice and her actions made me truly believe and love the character, even when she wasn't entirely lovable. John Leguizamo was simply superb as Toulouse-Lautrec, especially for someone who traipsed about on their knees throughout the entire film. I agree with many of Hollywood's best and brightest when they say that Jim Broadbent's Oscar this year was not only for ""Iris,"" but for this film as well.  Fatherly, comedic, and boss-like all at the same time, and managing to do it all with a large mustache and potbelly as well.One cannot mention the cast without mentioning the incomparable Richard Roxburgh and his incredibly hilarious yet amazingly imposing (at times) performance as the sinister Duke. Every singer, every dancer, every actor, every actress in this film was perfect.  Not a single hair was out of place.  Which leaves the director and magic maker himself, Baz Luhrmann.  Not many modern directors would set out to do a project like this.  Perhaps thirty years ago, but not now.  This was probably the biggest risk in his (and everyone else that worked on it, too) career.  Maybe the public is split down the middle, between those that love it and those that couldn't sit through twenty minutes of it, but this reviewer and movie viewer knows that this will go down in history as one of the greatest films of our time.",Moulin Rouge!

However, the brilliance of the movie lies in it's delivery.  Essentially, most tragic love stories are the same.  This movie elevates itself to greatness due to the masterful direction of Baz.  The frantic pace only serves to dazzle us more; the blinding colors and chaotic musical numbers truly make this film a tour de force.  The characters of Christian, Satine, Loutrec, Zidler, and the Duke are delivered splendidly by obviously talented actors.  The difference between many love stories and ""Moulin Rouge!"" is that this film actually tries...everything jumps out at the viewer to deliver the Bohemian message of truth, beauty, freedom, and love in an eye-popping way.  Many who see this movie will be left breathless; and muttering the timeless, honorable theme: ""the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.""  Now that is the mark of a great movie. 10/10",Moulin Rouge!
1329,sbaldis,"A movie I didn't expect to like, but wound up loving.",10,25 June 2002,"This movie transcends the way movies are made, Baz deserved the best director nod by a landslide over that Beautiful Mind director.  But whatever, what's done is done I guess(highway robbery).The movie's musical numbers fill you with so much joy and that sense of 'wow, that was pretty cool' feeling.  It's really an amazing movie.  The choice of songs somehow fit(save for a couple of songs, ie. that 'diamonds are a girls best friend' tune that gets sung over and over again throughout the movie I coulda done without) The storyline itself is of course, very 'Broadway' and thus, I don't mind at all that it didn't win Best Picture, but I still stand by my Best Director choice.I can sense a bunch of movies will come out soon attempting to copy Moulin Rouge, and frankly, I can't wait, here's hoping they don't ruin this newly realized genre'.",Moulin Rouge!
1330,jnmanix1,WoW!,10,17 July 2002,"When I first saw MOULIN ROUGE, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Musicals have been on the rise thanks in part to EVITA.  MOULIN ROUGE broke all the rules and showed that a movie musical can work in this day and time.  EVITA, DANCER IN THE DARK, LOVE'S LABOR LOST, and HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH all led up to this one great moment in time.  MOULIN ROUGE is stylish, creative and vivid.  Thus far, I have seen the movie 15 times.  I saw it eight times in the theatre (I had lots of dates at that time) and the rest on DVD - which by the way, is amazing in it's own rights and I suggest that if you don't own a DVD player, get it just to see this film and all the extra behind the scenes that go with it. It was a great shame that Ewan and Baz were not nominated for Oscars for their work on the film and showed Hollywoods lack of imagination (for the most part) in knowing great film-making when they see it. I can't wait to see what Baz will do next with the screen adaptation of the Tony Award winning musical RENT - not to mention the buzz that Baz may bring two of his movies, STRICTLY BALLROOM and MOULIN ROUGE, to the Broadway stage.  This man is bound for greatness.",Moulin Rouge!

On moment you are laughing hystarically and then next you could be crying.  Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor surprised me with their beautiful voice and of course acted wonderfully. But the real prize should go to Baz Lurman the director.  He beautifully told this story by creatively using fun modern music, weaving the images together masterfully.

You can't take your eyes off the screen while watching this movie.The music sequences are great, too. There's a lot of dancing and action. As I said before all the actors have great voices.

1336,dramaqueen270,An eye-popping classic,10,6 October 2002,"I absolutely love this film; it is my favorite of all time. Baz Lurhman is a brilliant director. Some don't like this film for its choppy shots and quick changes, but I think it is absolutely wonderful and original. I love the music, how they put modern songs in a movie taking place in 1899.Plus, even though it doesn't sound like it, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have wonderful voices. They have a lot of talent and the songs they sing are wonderful. Whoever put together the songs was very wise about their choices, because in scenes like the dance hall and the Roxanne scene the layered songs sound wonderful together.I think the best part was the green fairy sequence. That was brilliantly done, esp. how the fairy would be a little line and then stop, and it was if she was bursting out. All in all, I think this is the best movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching.",Moulin Rouge!

I love everything about the dance secuences, crazy visuals, songs and charactors. I feel like I went there, and saw it, no matter how different the Moulin Rouge really was. I love the powerful acting and outrageous comedy. Ever since this movie, I always look for Ewan McGregor's name on movies at SilverScreen rental. One thing that bothers me, is at the end, when you-know-what happens, it's all dramatic, and silent, and then Christian just wails. I never seem to be able to keep a straight face.",Moulin Rouge!

1342,eljersloan,A complete failure.,1,15 December 2002,"It seems that most people either hate this movie or love it. I just can't understand how anyone could like anything about this movie. I admit I am not the biggest fan of musicals, but I can usually see how others can enjoy them and find something to appreciate. Musicals need good songs like West Side Story, good production like Oliver, or just silly fun like Grease. This had nothing. The hyperactive editing, garish colors and awful, awful music made this one of the worst movies I have ever seen, possibly worse than Battlefield Earth. While the whole genre is pretty goofy, a musical should at least have good choreography. It is impossible to tell if anyone is even dancing in this movie with all of the edits, camera angles, and effects. Many have mentioned how cheeky it is to use modern hits in this period piece. What most don't mention is how terrible those songs are. ""Like A Virgin"" is an awful song in any century!",Moulin Rouge!

1346,elpulgadas,A Movie I Stopped Early,1,20 March 2010,"I had some expectation of a decent movie when I rented this but was still very disappointed. I shut it off after about a half hour as I could not follow the plot. There was Music and Singing but the actors were not good at musicals in my opinion. Couldn't they get real singers to play in the movie? The costumes and actions were busy and disconcerting and did not keep me hanging on long enough to see the movie through. Since this movie, I realized that Nicole Kidman's acting and/or movies are not worth watching. The only one I would recommend is the one where she lives in the haunted house. Next time producers would hopefully use singers to sing and actors to act.",Moulin Rouge!
1347,sfeyer,worst movie musical of the last 25 years (and that's saying a lot),1,17 March 2003,"Despite some rave reviews when it first came out, Moulin Rouge is totally inessential. The story is a standard love triangle, with no performances to distinguish it. Plot twists are utterly predictable. The direction is generally haphazard, cutting much too quickly from shot to shot (most movie musicals today have this problem, yet Chicago succeeds despite it).But worst of all is the music, a collection of pop standards rewritten for orchestra and vocalist. Some are almost unrecognizable, and there are interesting juxtapositions. But there's a reason it's called ""pop music"" -- it isn't any good musically. Most of the music is painful to listen to, without the energy of the stadium stage and the grind of drums and guitars. The gimmick is clever for 20 minutes and after that I was fast-forwarding to the end of musical numbers.I like movie musicals, but this kind of joyless cross-genre attempt to grab younger audiences will just drive them off when legitimate musicals are made into good movies -- such as Chicago. The most recent good example of the cross-genre movie musical, Madonna's Evita, is a much better film (and an infinitely better musical). If you want to rent a newish movie musical, get Newsies. The death of movie musicals has been declared prematurely, but another Moulin Rouge will certainly doom them",Moulin Rouge!
1348,oranges_parots,"Musically, Theatrically and Visually Stunning",10,16 September 2010,"From classic love songs to modern dance-provoking numbers, Moulin Rouge has made itself an instant Luhrman classic. Baz's hard work truly shows itself in the sheer musical perfection of the movie. Starring classic songs such as Elton John's 'Your Song' in a dreamy night scene of Christian (Ewan McGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman) dancing romantically under the stars. A fantastic medley of the greatest love songs ever written, sung excitedly on the suburban rooftops and inventively named 'Elephant Love Medly'. The whole Bohemian aura of the movie is theatrically enticing, with clearly defined characters who play a large part in the inspiring setting Paris. On the edge of the love, truth and freedom crazed revolution, young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) finds himself apart of a Bohemian play, and he's asked to write for them. He soon discovers himself reading his poetry to the club's star and beautiful courtesan Satine (Kidman), he instantly he falls in love with her and finds himself apart of a deadly love triangle with the clubs most prestigious patron- The Duke (Roxburgh) Throughout the film the camera angles vary from high panning shots of the musical to the intense face-to-face eye level romance cuts. Baz creatively uses black and white to colour scenes in conjunction with extreme wide shots to give the 'time travel' effect when zooming over the city in Paris. The editing and camera work all come together to form the classic Baz Style film that is easily recognized by any movie lover. During the scenes in the movie, it jumps from the present time to past rapidly with Christian (Ewan McGregor) typing the story as he narrates. It constantly zooms in and out of the Moulin Rouge to clearly portray the party vibe of the club. In the song 'Lady Marmalade' Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) jumps around the Moulin Rouge dancing with his burlesque women and keeping himself head of the party. Kidman makes her first entrance into The Moulin Rouge by coming down from the ceiling on a swing covered with glitter in an extravagant silver costume, she excitedly sings the world renowned song 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend'. ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return"" this important yet memorable quote takes front seat in the movie along with Christian's (McGregor) love song chorus quotes throughout. The young writer's infatuation with love builds up over the movie, though it does meet some twists and turns and he finds out love is not always easy. A musical masterpiece portrayed perfectly on screen this one of a kind movie hit jackpot in both actors and writers, with heartfelt songs to display the emotion and eccentric dance songs to give The Moulin Rouge the true burlesque finish. The top of a movie lover's must-watch list of all time.",Moulin Rouge!

It doesn't help that they tell you the ending at the beginning so that you know exactly what is coming.  Hate to be savage on an Australian movie but Nicole Kidman's wimpy, whiny singing voice was painful and the movie was trying too hard to be art-house that they let their artiness get in the way of the storyline.  I don't get the big deal about this movie.  It was boring and just dragged on.

Nicole Kidman is absolutely fabulous - who knew she could sing? Even if you find her annoying or stuck-up, Moulin Rouge gives her a totally different quality. Even if I never watch anything else of her's again, I will appreciate her role as Satine.Ewan McGregor is fabulous, and sings better than the majority of profession singers out there (his Scottish accent makes it better). McGregor, who is one of the world's best actors, in some admittedly unusual movies, sings, acts, and sobs like nothing you've seen before. No matter what you think of him, you owe it to yourself try this one out!Baz Luhrmann does a truly fantastic job on incorporating modern music into a classic piece; this should have won best picture, cinematography, sound, and costumes!The beginning makes you smile, the middle is a ""feast for the eyes"" (thank you, Ewan), and the ending will make you cry.

1358,serenasnazzyswan,Loved It - Some Boring Moments,8,30 August 2012,"First of all, it's a great film. Some parts are absolutely spectacular. I think that Nicole Kidman gives a great performance as Satine, a courtesan at the infamous Moulin Rouge, and Ewan McGregor as Christian, the writer. My favourite part of the film is from the very beginning up to the elephant love medley. I adored the sequence at the Moulin Rouge where Satine sings ""Diamonds are a girls best friend,"" (excellent singing throughout the movie, by the way, and all done by Nicole and Ewan.) I also loved the ""pitch"" where the Bohemians pitch their idea of a play to the wicked and evil Duke. Although many parts of the film are strong, I got bored with some of the musical performances and found myself skipping past them. Nevertheless, a GREAT film for anyone but the ending may come as as a shock.",Moulin Rouge!

Now, on to this movie. I wanted to hate it so bad, it came out at the same time as the first LOTR so I was naturally pitted against it because of the Oscars. I went on hating this movie I had never seen for being a musical. and also for reworking old songs in a new way (I had caught glimpses of the movie walking through the living room while my sisters watched it). Finally i sat down to watch the thing on a lonely weeknight, and was just totally ripped from my hate of the premise and placed firmly in the seat of one who would decry all who disliked it. The film reeks of freshness, the style is so unlike so much trash that is out in Hollywood currently. Yet while it seems over the top when viewed in a snapshot, the film as a whole is magnificent. I wont try and describe all the elements that I loved, you can see them for yourself (youll have to watch it more than once to get everything, the first viewing is a lot of you getting used to the style). If an 18 year old, at the time, die-hard action nut and sci-fi nerd can like this musical;anyone should.",Moulin Rouge!
1360,eeva-pusa,Simply fantastic,10,19 September 2017,"Written for English class.Moulin Rouge! (2001) is a movie musical that takes place in the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris - Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young writer, falls in love with the cabaret actress and courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). Their love is doomed from the start, since Satine is set to marry the wealthy Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), who has promised to invest in the cabaret if he gets Satine in return. In spite of all, the two start a dangerous love affair.To some viewers the characters may seem unrealistic and hard to understand, but after learning more about Luhrmann's style in general, I believe that that is exactly what he was going for. Christian is a hopeless romantic, ready to do anything for love, while Satine is at first extremely skeptic and doesn't believe in true love. In Moulin Rouge! these two main characters aren't the only ones with strong personas - Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the head of the cabaret, is comically melodramatic and jolly, while the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is exactly his opposite - so snappy and angry it may feel overdone at times. All of the actors in this film do a fantastic job portraying such dramatic characters.One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is ""El Tango de Roxanne"". This scene depicts Luhrmann's style quite well - the entire set, (especially the lighting) and the dancing are very dramatic and truly engage the viewer. Furthermore, the editing jumps from one place to another very quickly. Luhrmann's style can also be heard in the songs - the song they are dancing to is the rock song Roxanne by The Police, released in 1978, combined with the tango ""Tanguera"" by Mariano Mores, released in 1953. The events of Moulin Rouge! occur somewhere in the early 1900s, so neither one of these songs would have been released back then.Moulin Rouge! has been one of my all-time favourite movies ever since I first saw it. I absolutely love everything about it, and what especially stuck with me were the music and the actors, who all did a fantastic job. Not to mention the ending, which left me speechless for days. The production design, as it is in all of Luhrmann's films, is breathtaking - every scene feels extremely carefully thought out.",Moulin Rouge!

The plot elements of love and endurance are absolutely lost under slapstick comedy and artistic camera experiments. Quite frankly, even in the midst of all the turmoil of the plot, I didn't feel a think for these characters. No affection, no pity.This movie came very highly recommended, and it is indeed lovely to look at, but there's no substance here at all.

1364,uperesafakava,The Best Musical,10,15 September 2014,"I loved the film from beginning to ending. I wanted to use the bathroom before the film started at the theater, but then it did. I then stopped to watch it, popcorn and coke bottle in hand. Two hours later, I was still in the movie theater watching and crying as the final scene ended. This was the ONLY time I watched the film because I couldn't betray myself from escaping another movie-filled life.Then, Saturday night on September 13. I was tired of the paid channels programming so I clicked on the remote through channels, then I stopped on CBS. It was a film. I waited what it was. Then, the beginning started. I told my son that I watched this before and couldn't put in my mind where I have seen it. Then, the Sound of Music theme played, then I knew it. My son thought it was the Sound of Music. I loved every second of it again! I then downloaded the film and here I am reviewing. Moulin Rouge! is by far the best musical and one of the best films I have ever seen!

1365,BohemianElegance,Absolutely fabulous! My favorite movie of all time!,10,8 June 2005,"Moulin Rouge is the best movie I've ever seen. It blends tantalizing visuals with a gripping plot. Nicole Kidman portrays her character perfectly. She surprises the audience with singing, comedy, and extreme drama. She gains the viewer's sympathy from her first scene and amazes with her captivating beauty. Ewan MacGregor is unbelievably charming and also is a surprisingly talented musician. The rest of the cast includes seasoned actors such as Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo, and Richard Roxberg. The characters are eccentric and memorable,they range from immensely comedic to tragic. Luhrmann created a quality love story in the spectacular bohemian world of Paris at the turn of the century. Old songs are given new light and morphed into poignant musical dialogue that would otherwise be far too simple. The constant criticism of the movie as being just a series of reckless clichés completely overlooks the fundamental purpose of the film: effectively acounting for all of the conventional and unconventional views on love and art and culminating them into a deeply moving story. Having seen both Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet, it is of my personal opinion that Moulin Rouge takes the best qualities and doubles their effect. It is the originality of the movie that clings to the viewer long after the credits. Luhrmann and the all the cast should be applauded for their bold move to enter a genre that had long been considered out-dated.",Moulin Rouge!
1366,alicejohnson222,Spectacular spectacular!!,10,10 September 2013,"This is, without doubt, the best film I have ever seen. The story struck a chord with me instantly and I was swept off my feet within the first 5 minutes. Satine and Christian's story is the most powerful cinematic love story to ever grace our screens. I was captivated by the darkness of it all yet inspired by the joy and romance. I think so many films are cliché and rather cheesy but this definitely isn't. Visually the movie is stunning and the songs are brilliant; a unique twist on the everyday musical. The script also doesn't disappoint. Nichole and Ewan do a a fantastic job of portraying the characters, nobody could get across the love that they feel for one another and the pain they have to go through to be together. You would be crazy not to give this film a go, it truly is just beautiful! The greatest thing you will ever learn is just to love and be loved in return. Enjoy!",Moulin Rouge!

Besides that, it's such a complete film, it's a musical, a comedy, a drama and a romantic movie, and both leading and supporting actors make it all work.When I first saw Moulin Rouge, I wondered if I could have a life like that, full of emotions and dreams, and if I could fall in love in such a romantic way. And I'm not getting tired of watching it again every time I can.So if you like dreaming, and you believe that love can change everything, you'll be glad to watch one of the best movies Hollywood has produced.",Moulin Rouge!

Ewan McGregor (Star Wars, Trainspotting) marvels and Nicole Kidman (Cold Mountain) sparkles in this entertaining, sad, romantic musical.Christian (McGregor) goes to the Moulin Rouge to write but falls in love with a beautiful Courtesan (Kidman) and the movie is about how they have to hide their love from people such as the enigmatic Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent: Bridget Jones' Diary) and the slimy Duke (Richard Roxburgh: Van Helsing). However, as all good love stories go she has to end it for their sake and then inevitably she dies.All songs performed by the stars in a movie that is truly legendary, and will be remembered forever.I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who loves, romance but also to those who love music as this movie ingeniously uses modern musical number from people such as Sir Elton John and David Bowie, to Fatboy Slim and Xtina, making the movie so much more enjoyable. The acting is astounding and the storyline moving.",Moulin Rouge!
1370,rdebonosmith,Sensational,7,22 July 2016,"What you need to know about this film is that it is all about love. It is a story of lust, greed, jealousy and music, music expresses what words cannot and that is shown throughout this film. From beginning to end, I was completely captivated and this was because it was so quirky and beautifully scripted that I felt I was a part of the Moulin Rouge. Baz Luhrmann directed and helped write this musical and I have always been a big fan of his work.. The protagonists Satine (Nicole Kidman) and Christian (Ewan McGregor) are the unlucky and unlikely lovers as Satine mistakenly assumes that Christian is the Duke (Richard Roxburgh). Christian is in fact a young writer who travelled from London to Paris in search of inspiration and maybe love and Satine is the 'Sparkling Diamond' of the club who catches the eye of both Chrstian and the Duke. Satine wants to seduce the Duke so he can give her wealth but also help her to achieve her dream of being an actress. Early on we can tell that the two men will be fighting over Satine but it seems a greater threat is at large. The film takes its inspiration from 20th century music specifically love songs and even creates a medley of many popular love songs of the century. One thing I do love about this film is the soundtrack, the music intertwines perfectly with the plot and it really does help into showing us the characters true intentions.Obviously not every film is perfect and this film has its flaws but I think that is what makes it so honest and their love so captivating. The cinematography and the editing is beautifully composed, very quirky and quite dark for a film of this genre.Overall this film is a must see if you are a fan of romance, drama, comedy and above all else music. Also if you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann then I would definitely put this film on my 'To See' list.RJ x",Moulin Rouge!
1371,annie_hall90,fantastic,10,12 September 2005,"Moulin Rouge is and masterpiece by Baz Luhrmann, the Aussie directer that changed modern cinema. He's directed Romeo and Juliet, and Stricktly Ballroom, but Moulin Rouge is my personal favourite out of the 3, but it's my favourite movie so that's expected. Here's whyStarting with the visual aspects, the costumes are breathtaking, surpassing other movies by leagues. The set is equally fantastic. It's too awesome to put in words.Nicole Kidman is breathtaking as Satine, while Ewan McGregor gives a wonderful performance as Christian the love-struck poet. Both display amazing singing abilities, performing all their own songs, with only a singing coach to help them. Not bad for 2 actors.Ewan McGregor says it all ""I really think it will just blow everyone away. It really is a feast for the senses"" Couldn't have said it better...",Moulin Rouge!
1372,celeborndumbledore,Fantastic!,10,2 May 2008,"This film is very exciting. All actors are amazing, and I want to said ""Nicole Kidman, you are the best actress of our century"". It's just fantastic, how this story is so close to everyone of us and how we very often don't understand the life and it's power. The Power of the dream, the power of Love. The Year of 2001 is one of this golden years, which are coming sometimes to remind us for the greatest time of cinema, in this year was born ""Harry Potter"", in the same period was born and ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Beautiful Mind"" too. It was one of the best years in the history of cinema. After this movie I'm feeling very sophisticated and feel how my hearth beat with power which we, peoples said ""Love"".",Moulin Rouge!
1373,jess040570,absolutely fantastic film,10,8 August 2005,"Nicole Kidman and Ewan Magregor are fantastic. this is a fantastic film from start to finish. This is a film you have to watch several times. When i first watched it i thought it was a lot to take in. Fantastic story and the songs are brilliant Nicole Kidman has a brilliant voice, Ewan Magregor has a great voice too. Absolutely fantastic excellent choices of songs for appropriate scenes.I must have watched this movie a thousand times one of my favourite films of all time, this is a classic for me. 11 out of 10 :) excellent top film. it makes you laugh and it makes you cry.

1375,azn_sky2001,Absolutely wonderful and majestic film!,10,20 October 2007,This is one of my favorite movies of all time since it's original and full of excitements and those gorgeous scenery backdrops of vintage Paris and famous sites (like the Moulin Rouge) is just WOW! The visuals of the movie were really magical and very theatrical and mind blowing. The men and women (especially the lovely Nicole Kidman) have amazing costume designs and I can't really explain how I feel about the whole movie because it is just breathtaking to watch. I've never felt excited to see movies that much until I started watching a trailer for the movie and it had great strong dynamic performances and visuals were I felt I will actually feel like I am anticipating for a movie release which is rarely. The plot was pure genius and had great depth to story telling and the lead actors Ewan and Nicole were truly top notch and their chemistry makes everyone fall in love even more. All of the musical scores and songs sung by the actors were brilliantly done and I would recommend people who have not watched the movie to SEE IT! It is the most amazing thing you will see.,Moulin Rouge!

I just ""watched"" it a few hours ago and my ears are still aching. This movie is loud. Everybody is yelling and running around. I really cannot say I watched this movie but I tried. And I tried hard. After about 30 minutes I fell asleep. Fortunately the screaming voices of the fat and ugly Moulin-Rouge dancers awoke me. I started forwarding to the next scene that seemed to be of any importance. Unfortunately it was the end. So I got back to the Moulin-Rouge jumping and screaming dancers and tried again to find something interesting. Actually I reduced the rest of the movie (about one hour) to 5 minutes.My tip: Reduce the whole thing to 10 minutes and make a music clip out of it. Or even better: cut all the dancing scenes, just keep McGregor and Kidman as main characters, slow all the pacing down and give it an open end. Oh sorry, someone just told me Dior already had this idea but Ewan McGregor wasn't available for the shooting.My unanswered questions: 1st - Where is the praised passion in this movie? You can find more passion in the eyes of Cary Grant kissing Eva Marie Saint in North by Northwest than in the whole Moulin-Rouge thing. 2nd - What is so sexy about this movie? The naked flesh you see from time to time?I still don't regret to have partly seen the movie. I discovered Ewan McGregor's lovely voice.",Moulin Rouge!

1380,ancamg,Super musical movie,10,5 November 2006,"Excellent movie. I've watched it so many times and I just can't get bored. The music is wonderful and the atmosphere is magical. It's full of symbols like those of the free and caged birds, Toulouse's make up, weather changes, verses from well known melodies. It is difficult to compare it with other musicals but I remember another masterpiece My Fair Lady. I was happy to realize that now the actors were not dubbed anymore, a thing that unfortunately happened to Audrey Hepburn. All the actors were magnificent. Beautiful animations! I really love it! I only wish it could have taken some Oscars but being deeply Australian may be an explanation.",Moulin Rouge!

When I saw it****************OH MY GOD****************** I had never come out at the end of a film feeling so....SPARKLY. It left such a magical feeling inside me, which sounds ridiculous because it's just a film. I thought the colours, the detail, the characters and the story were amazing, and the music was out of this world. It was like it was the movie I had been waiting my whole life to see, my dream. Until then I had never heard of any of the actors in it, and I became comically obsessed with all of them. My favourite is Nicole Kidman, she is the best actress ever.",Moulin Rouge!
1382,joshaustin-74683,One of the best non-Disney musicals,10,12 October 2017,"""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.""Moulin Rouge! is directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. This movie tells the story of a young poet named Christian (Ewan McGregor) who plunges into the insane world of the Moulin Rouge, where he meets and falls in love with the club's most popular and beautiful star, Santine (Nicole Kidman).The only musicals I have ever really enjoyed have come from Disney. I find a musical every now and then that wasn't made by Disney and although I may really enjoy that movie, I have never found one that I have thought was an outstanding movie. That has now changed. Moulin Rouge! surpassed my expectations and I have definitely say that in my opinion, this is an outstanding movie. The songs where all great and memorable, the acting was fantastic and the movie itself looked amazing!My main issue with musicals is that I find that many of the songs begin at awkward times, the songs aren't memorable enough to remember and that many musicals have songs that I simply don't like. All of the songs in Moulin Rouge! are great and are all very memorable! All of the songs fit what is going on at that moment in the movie. One thing I would like to say is, who the hell knew that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman had such great singing voices? They should definitely show off their talent more often!The songs in this film were great and so was the acting. I have only seen a couple of movies starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor before watching this and I definitely want to watch more of their movies! They both put on great performances in this film as Santine and Christian! Their chemistry was great and I would like to see them work together again in the future on another movie! We also can't forget about the performances from the rest of the cast, especially Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh, who I definitely think deserve more credit than what they get! Richard Roxburgh was great as the The Duke and Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler was a crazy performance and was one of the best supporting actor performances I have seen in a while!Moulin Rouge! was a very bizarre, crazy, depressing, happy, exciting, emotional experience. I have not enjoyed a film this much in a while! I know that not everybody will agree with my opinion as there are a lot of people out there that don't like this movie but if you haven't seen it, I personally highly recommend it! It is definitely one of my favorite musicals that isn't made by Disney, one of my all time favorite romance films (a genre I don't enjoy that much so I'm surprised I enjoyed this film so much) and one of my favorite films! This is a very different film but it's one that I don't think you should pass on!",Moulin Rouge!

Moulin Rouge is my favorite movie... it's a ""must see"". I hope you like it. It's Wonderful. I am very sad as I didn't watch it in the ""Big-screen"", but I have seen it twenty or more times.

The proof that 2001 was one of the strongest years in history, and that Oscar rarely notices true greatness. For proving that rationality is a unnecessary bitch, that tension and music are as needed as anything and especially at the same time. And for proving that a happy ending can be anything you can imagine, with everything collapsing to the ground at once, eyes watching, hearts stopping, you think, no, and then... :fade to white: A film I didn't expect to love, a film I didn't expect to stay within my soul. Yet here we are. A+",Moulin Rouge!
1385,funnyhoney42,Best. Movie. Ever.,10,18 November 2006,"I never knew I could love a movie as much as I do Moulin Rouge. Honestly. People like what they like, but I am tired of hearing people say stuff like, ""It's so weird."" People who have no basis for their comments sound undereducated and closed-minded. Baz Luhrmann is an excellent director because he doesn't care about making generic movies that are not memorable. You can always tell he is the director when you see one of his films and I love that about them. Nicole and Ewan and the rest of the cast are perfect in their roles, too. I absolutely love the music they picked for the movie and that makes it fun to watch. LOVE IT!",Moulin Rouge!

The costumes, music, storyline, and actors are beautiful. I loved every aspect of this movie! It was great. I love the passion and how it can make a person laugh at the same time! Nicole Kidman is an astonishing actress! She definitely brings beauty and life to the movie!! I really like how part of the storyline is almost silently revealed at the beginning of the movie. It is so very sad, and it makes me cry every time I watch it. Satine's death is so very sad!It truly is a powerful movie and it deserves to be highlighted by those who love, like, and maybe even adore it! Once again, I say that Nicole Kidman is wonderful in this movie, and she and Ewan McGregor have wonderful chemistry throughout the entire story. All the songs have wonderful placement in the film, and I absolutely adore ""Come What May."" It's a beautiful song, and it represents everything that everyone hopes for in life and in love.

The songs are brilliant the acting is brilliant, everything is brilliant.Not looking at the art aspect of this look at the acting aspect. It had Nicole Kidman and Ewan MCgregor.

1389,montypython10,"A choppy, hackneyed mess",1,10 April 2011,"If I was going to be charitable, I'd take into consideration that Baz Luhrmann is not a cinematic director, and most of his experience comes from the theater. Unfortunately, given that Luhrmann did prove that he was capable of making a somewhat competent film with Romeo + Juliet, he gets no sympathy. Luhrmann acts like a child given a complex new toy with no instructions how to use it. Throughout the history of filmmaking, directors influence the attention of the audience by letting the actors' performance naturally become the focus of a scene; Luhrmann apparently regards his actors as too bland or his audience as too dim to understand where attention must be paid. To that end, every single scene is a mess of jump cuts, overused camera tricks and forced, ham-fisted acting. Shaky/walking cam? Check. Lens flares? Cartoonish sound effects? Soft focus? Multiple angles of the same scene? D-r-a-m-a-t-i-c-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-e-d d-o-w-n m-o-v-e-m-e-n-t and RAPIDLYSPEDUPACTION? Fade-ins, fade-outs repeatedly breaking the fourth wall? Check, check, double-check. All of these happening once in a movie is enough to wreck it, but these happen so often it's as if Luhrmann was just goofing around in a consumer-level video editing software with a bunch of footage from other films.The result is not a fulfilling journey into an otherworldly and hallucinogenic world, but a wearying, tedious slog through a vile bastardization of turn-of-the-millennium pop culture and hackneyed film tricks.It's not even campy fun.",Moulin Rouge!
1390,aiken,"Daring, and mostly successful",9,7 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a refreshing break from today's world of test-marketed, demographically targeted, homogonized hollywood garbage.  Loosely based around the myth of Oprheus, it's obviously the realization of Baz's dream rather than the result of committees and rewrites based on test screening report cards.The first half of the movie is dazzling and inventive, shockingly fun and surprisingly light on its feet.  The movie slows a bit in the second half and gets more serious, but for me it still pulled it off quite nicely. Sure, it doesn't succeed all the time, and I would have edited it down about 10 minutes (mostly in the rehersal for the show-within-the-show), but so what?  This is not a *perfect* film, this is a *very, very good* film.I completely understand why some people don't like Moulin Rouge.  The movie takes a lot of chances, and isn't afraid to do completely unconventional (even absurd) things.  This is not a ""safe"" movie in any sense of the word. To enjoy it, you really have to just let Baz take you through his vision; if you expect it to cater to your preconceptions of what a movie or musical should be like, you're going to be disappointed.However, if you've got any imagination at all, and you want to see something truly different -- go see this film right now.  It really is something special.",Moulin Rouge!

Perhaps the reason I enjoy them, but not this pseudo-opera puke-frenzy, is that I can take in the scenes and enjoy them rather than be dizzied with gratuitous and intrusive editing.  This film hints that it contains incredible visuals, but it never lingers long enough to permit verification.  I just remember the color RED! This flick will probably kill more than a handful of epileptics.
Perhaps it's optimized to be viewed while high.   If someone has tried it, please relate the experience...A positive note:  the DVD has lots of extras and some cool features to tweak the setup of home theaters and surround-sound.",Moulin Rouge!

I went in with one concept, I didn't know too much about it, and came out with a greater appreciation for the art of the movie musical.My two favorite songs was Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"", sung by all guys no less, and ""Roxanne"" sung by the ""The Narcoleptic Argentinian"" in a great gravel voice.  It was an experience that anyone who loves musicals would enjoy and reminiscence about for a long time.All in all, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals.",Moulin Rouge!

I don't know how else to say it, but I think this is possibly the most boring and uninteresting movie I have ever seen.

From the opening scenes Moulin Rouge had the aura of Baz Luhrmann, who in my mind is one of the best directors on earth.Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor were perfectly, if unexpectedly, cast in the lead roles.  Having the mixture of well known songs (listen for Madonna's Like a Virgin and Nirvana's Smells like Teen Spirit) and originals kept the movie interesting and exciting.As I left the cinema, along with my friends (one of whom was sobbing uncontrollably) I could hear many fellow movie goers proclaiming exactly the same statement as myself: 'I have just found a new favourite film.'",Moulin Rouge!

At first I didn't think I would like it, even though I am a sucker for a musical and a good love story. And, as viewers already know, this is a story about love.  The classic ""boy-gets-girl, or does he?"" story with some exciting twists and turns and laughs and tears along the way. I was pleasantly surprised by Nicole Kidman's and Ewan McGregor's voices. They were beautiful (on the eyes too lol).  I'll never listen to ""Your Song"" quite the same way again. ""Come What May"" makes me wish I was getting married all over again so I could have that as my wedding song. I'm speechless at this point except to say, see this movie- if you haven't already.

I have to admit, I had my doubts as to wither Kidman and McGregor could sing. My doubts were laid to rest. Both hold their own, with McGregor showing he has quite a singing talent.

Moulin Rouge is quite simply fantastic.The directing, acting, cinematography, singing and of course the music are first rate.I was glued to my seat (a hurricane wouldn't of moved me) for the 2 hour duration. I didn't look at my watch once (which is unusual for me) my eyes where transfixed to the silver screen.The first 10 minutes you are thinking ""this is very strange and what on earth am I watching"". But when you get used to this (it doesn't take long) you are in amazement. Their is a 15 minute (approximately) scene near the beginning which leaves your jaw open right to the floor.Luhrmann has decided to give us can-can dancers, dancing and singing to the likes of Nirvana's ""Smells like teen spirit"" to name but a few. With close up camera shots, fast moving pace and flashy editing. Sure there is a few corny scenes during the films between McGregor and Kidman. But it is a true wonder to watch.You have got to watch out for the excellent re-working of Madonnas ""Like a Virgin"". The film was also just the right length another 20 minutes and it might of started dragging. 20 minutes shorter and I would of been annoyed.I have forgot to mention McGregor and Kidman's singing, ignore what all/some of the critic's are saying they really can and do sing. The whole perzaz, Luhrmann's flare for style and being unconventional are something else.I urge everybody to see this film. It is definitely in my top 5 of films seen at the cinema this year.Thank you for reading this far.",Moulin Rouge!

Maybe it is, if you do like at least romance and love stories. I think it IS a movie for people who like musicals - especially the Andrew Lloyd Webber-style ones:""Moulin Rouge!"" is very Webber-stylish.

1409,terry-88,Quite possibly the worst movie of all time!,1,16 January 2003,"Baz Luhrmann makes Ed Wood look like Truffaut. At least Wood had no budget as an excuse. Luhrmann has made a movie of pseudo-pop style and absolutely no substance, a piece of frivolous camp which makes the fatal mistake of taking itself seriously. You are better off renting Rocky Horror Picture Show and watching an honest work of cinema.The film is a derivative, cliche-ridden two-hour music video. It has little to do with the real Moulin Rouge, either in setting, history, or people. Yes, we see Monte Martre and a red windmill, but they are scarcely recognizable after the computer animators got through with them.The script is absolutely dreadful, with no perceptible distinction between scenes of comedy and attempted pathos. The only clues we are given by the director are via his knee-jerk invocation of passe cinematic devices, like when doomed heroine Kidman repeatedly falls to the floor in skip-frame slow-mo. Otherwise, the characters whoosh around with cartoon sound effects, like Wile E. Coyote, making them less than one-dimensional -- a fractal dimension of about 0.3, perhaps.""Moulin Rouge"" will probably be remembered in film history as the apex of the ""auteur gone wild with cash"" period of the turn of the 21st century. It is destined to be shown in film schools as one of the finest examples of how not to make a movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1410,speak,Love above all,10,18 November 2001,"Moulin Rouge has no unique or original story.From the start of time people talk of great loves that simply can't have a happy ending.What Moulin Rouge is all about, is a pandemonium a colours and scenes,a really divine soundtrack and an excellent cast.Furthermore it isn't just a boring,usual,sloppy film with a dull sky and some poor people crying all the time about their fate.Everything is happening so fast and you enjoy the crazy rythms of the ballet or the many funny qoutes and comical scenes.I think that it's the first true musical that is made after a long long time.And if your are in love you just can't stay untouched by this movie.",Moulin Rouge!

First of all, I'd like to say that I've never been a fan of neither Ewan nor Nicole, but now I've realized that I have underestimated them. I was really astonished by the surprisingly great performance they made. My first impression when I saw and, above all, listen Ewan's ""My gift is my song // and this one's for you"", was that I, as Satine did, was going to fall in love with him. Later on I decided that they were the most enamoured couple in the world. Secondly I've gotta say that the Zidler's ""Like A Virgin"" has been, for me, one of the most funny times I've enjoyed in a since ever. And, what about the rest of the film? The Greatest Thing In The World...",Moulin Rouge!

1415,kkrouner,a TRUE feast for the senses,10,16 August 2001,"This is by far the best movie I have seen since 1999.  I wanted to see it since I saw the first trailer simply due to my affinity for musicals, but I had no idea what I was in for.  It was the best musical every put to screen. They managed to capture all the theatrical elements while still effectively employing cinematic elements.  And Ewan MacGregor's voice should not be ignored any longer.  He was born to sing.  And as we already knew he is one heck of an Actor.  I was never a big Nicole Kidman fan, but she blew me away as well.  And with a supporting cast of relative unknowns (save John Leguizamo) they all played their parts to a tee.  Mr. Leguizamo showed us his voice talents as well.  Again totally unexpected.See this movie.  For your own good and to help perpetuate movies like it.",Moulin Rouge!

If not always hitting the mark bang on, it is never dull, never pretentious and never less than whole-hearted. Completely exuberant, I left with a smile, and more importantly I couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterwards. This review is everything the film isn't - see it.",Moulin Rouge!

They managed to pull off a love story without making it corny and the characters were hilarious.

There's  great music to suit almost every taste and most importantly - Ewan is fine!!!!,Moulin Rouge!
1419,ethel.symolon,Moulin Rouge is The Matrix of musicals.,10,4 June 2001,"Fast, brash, and relentless in sound and image. Nicole Kidman is a diamond in the dark, rough setting of this fin-de-surreal Montmartre. With a marvelous cast and endless surprises, this film takes you where no musical has gone before. Enjoy the trip.",Moulin Rouge!
1420,mtaylormicky,"Who needs a plot when you can have Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love?",10,19 November 2001,"This film has been slated by numerous people for a lack of originality and a feather-weight plot. Both of these criticisms I find hard to fathom. For one thing, I can guarantee that you have never seen a movie like this before, and are unlikely to see anything quite like it again. For another, the entire genre of love stories isn't exactly groaning with stunning and complex plot lines, so why should this one suddenly have to be judged by some monumental standard, particularly when it has so much else to offer?What makes 'Moulin Rouge' so special is not only the much discussed pace of the opening twenty minutes, or the way in which the perfectly chosen songs are fused and reworked into each other and the story, but the performances of the entire cast, from the evident enjoyment they display in the early ensemble scenes through to the love scenes between Ewan McGregor (who has a smile to die for) and Nicole Kidman, both of whom look stunningly beautiful and have real chemistry (they CAN sing too).The film also manages to avoid the law of diminishing returns, with each musical number or emotional twist being bigger/better/funnier/sadder than the last, no mean achievement when you consider the scale of the opening.I don't want to give away any details, so I'll leave it there and just urge everyone to see this film for themselves because it really is worth it - funny, sad, entertaining, overwhelming and very touching. Who needs a hefty plot when faced with all of that?",Moulin Rouge!
1421,bffbcoolgirl,No words can describe the feeling,10,2 June 2001,"No words can describe the feeling that I felt as I sat in the theater watching this movie.  I usually don't write reviews because a movie doesn't move me to.  This movie obviously did.  You were so sympathetic and urging to the romance going on in the movie nothing else mattered.  Ewan and Nicole made it ever so more wonderful as the perfect match.  Their chemistry was like magic and so was the acting.  In fact all of the acting was magnificent and you really appreciate it in a film with so many emotions like this one.Again I have to applaud on the directing and color used in the film.  It pulled you in entirely and considering what this film is about, thats pretty important.  It was all so beautifully well done, there couldn't of been any mistakes.  Kudos to everyone for their singing.  I loved it and plan to get the soundtrack as soon as possible.A beautiful movie that reached deep down, and touched my soul.  See it as soon as possible.",Moulin Rouge!
1422,StumpRider,Just too silly.,2,4 June 2001,"Frenetic MTV style adaption of a love story, pandering to that demographic. Colorful with great  music, but just too silly. Story doesn't hold the energy of this film together. One of these films that  came close to being truly different enough to define a genre (like Matrix) but seriously flawed and therefore comes off poorly.",Moulin Rouge!
1423,lordirving,Fantastic,10,8 June 2001,"This movie was like a wild rollercoaster ride in the beginning with a fast pace and striking camera angles.  The music is beautifully arranged and can Ewan sing!!!!  I saw it on Monday and was back again on Thursday and loved it just as much the second time.  Even with a sad ending, I left the theatre energized.  Simply wonderful.",Moulin Rouge!
1424,soulofajedi,A breathtaking masterpiece,10,5 June 2001,"There aren't really any words I could use to describe the experience of seeing Moulin Rouge for the first time, but I will try.Baz Luhrmann is known films that distance the audience from reality by use of dance (Strictly Ballroom), language (Romeo + Juliet), and music here in Moulin Rouge.  Yet in all of his films, the music conveys the meaning and the depth of emotion of the scene far better than just dialogue alone.Some people have criticized Moulin Rouge for its use of non-period songs, but in my opinion, the music is what brings the emotional story of Satine and Christian to life.  Luhrmann draws upon songs familiar to us--ones likely to tug at our personal heart strings and call up memories of our reactions to the songs--and interweaves them spectacularly to amplify the feelings going on at the time.  I couldn't imagine any sort of music that could define the particular feel of the Moulin Rogue club scene better than the mix of ""Lady Marmalade,"" ""Teen Spirit"" and the ""Can Can.""  It gives a sense of the spectacular, the thrill, the eroticism, and the bigger-than-life sensation, to which defies description.  The Roxanne tango sequence was exceptional, using both the dramatic situations of the characters and the expertly woven dance sequence together, and using the music to build it into one the most brilliant sequences of cinema I've seen in a long time.The images of the film are as breathtaking as the musical scope.  The first half rushes by in an absinthe-induced dream, where the people and situations seem bigger and brighter, and the hallucinations are just as real as the people.  The style of the drab outer Parisian world seems to be cut from the same cloth as the early films and the degaurre-type photography, giving the sense of the old and the classic, but also the sense that the outer, older, non-bohemian world is somehow out-dated to the colorful, larger-than-life underworld of the Moulin Rouge.  And then, just as the theatre of the period was beginning to, the style swings from spectacle to more realistic.  Yet even these more down-to-earth scenes have visually exceptional and other-worldly quality.  As for the acting, I think that as a whole, the ensemble cast did a fabulous job, getting back to the styles of acting at the time, when pratfalls and circus-like conditions were the norm.As to the plot, I've heard many people call it ""fluff,"" so to speak.  The plotline may be simplified, but the story--true love--is something that every human being longs for deep inside.  True love, in its most basic form, doesn't need fancy trappings or complicated situations, just as most of the emotions racing around inside our hearts.  It's simple, pure, and uncomplicated.  And this simple love story, conveyed through a brilliant score and heart-felt acting, has carried away so many people with its scope. That scope doesn't necessarily come from wrinkles in the plotline, but from the scope of the human heart and our capacity to believe in true love.I think that Baz Luhrmann and his team have creating a trancendant piece of literature that has touched many people already, and will most likely be rewarded come Oscar time, whether or not the rest of entertainment year picks up steam.In closing, I would urge you to see it, and appreciate it for whatever it means to you.",Moulin Rouge!
1425,PB-26,Still burning in the veins,10,6 July 2001,"Baz & Co's Moulin Rouge is like oxygen; it lifts us up where we belong! Really, the IMDB ratings and the comments say it all. Moulin Rouge received some mixed reviews in the US, but don't let that stop you seeing this while you can! Anyone picking apart the plot totally misses the point. Anyone ""mauled"" or ""bewildered"" by their first experience really just has to see it again. It just gets BETTER AND BETTER. Like so many, I'll never get enough of this film; it feels like the best I've ever seen. Unlike for most films, getting the DVD will be a truly treasured moment, not just a nice way to test out the sound system. Short of heartfelt song, words really don't suffice.",Moulin Rouge!
1426,ethunder,"Visually stunning, emotionally captivating, musically brilliant.",10,16 May 2001,"One of the most amazing motion picture experiences to be had. The cast delivers magically from top to bottom, leads, supporting leads, dancers, all.  Nicole and Ewan prove beautiful and incredibly talented, musically and visually. John Leguizamo transforms himself magically. The directing is inspiring, cinematography is tantalizing. The use of color, texture, perspective and device is clever and entrancing. Thank you Baz for an intense experience that reminds me of the reason I'm a part of this industry.  As an artist, as a person.  Do NOT miss this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1427,shurlygurl,This movie is an Insult.,2,1 July 2001,"When I saw the previews for this movie I thought it was a movie I would fall in love with.  Unfortunately the movie was NOTHING like the previews, at least the ones I saw.  For the first 15 minutes of the movie i thought this was going to be fabulous.  I even thought the use of Nirvana's song when first at the Moulin Rouge was a nice touch, the song was well used and appropriate.  Soon after that everything went to pot.  This movie was an attempt at a modernization of La Boheme...  La Boheme is a fabulous piece of literature.  A few years back a show came out on Broadway called RENT. This was an absolutely wonderful show, a rock musical with an entirely original score. Moulin Rouge was an insult to both La Boheme and Rent.
Aside from Beautiful costumes (which most sequences went entirely too fast to even catch a good glimpse of) this movie has few redeeming qualities. The plot is shallowed, cheesed out and lacking and the whole story brought to an elementary level.  It seems perhaps Luhrman used the renditions of 80s songs to gain the interest of younger generations that might not have gone to see the film if they knew it was a musical all its own.  Gilbert and Sullivan style 80s songs do not a good movie make.  If they had went to the trouble to make an original score I would have been impressed.  Seeing the list of people he had working on the movie there was more than enough creative people that that movie could have had original score.  Instead the butchered hit songs from a previous decade.  It was a show of bad judgment or cowardice of attempting a modern musical on it's own two feet.I truly appreciated Baz Luhrman's version of Romeo and Juliet.  It was good not only in art direction, but in modernizing a masterpiece as well. Luhrman did Not live up to his potential.",Moulin Rouge!
1428,n3nity,How wonderful life is now you're in the world,10,10 December 2001,"I suppose you can love this movie... or hate it. But for me it's one of the greatest movies in the world. The colors (the chaotic spinning images as Christian enters the Moulin Rouge for the first time), the music (The combination of songs in the elephant love medley...How do you get the Idea they could go together SO well!), the acting but most of all the cinematography is just perfect: The flying hats, the singing moon (isn't it sweet), the green fairy (maybe there are some reasons to change my mind and become a lesbian... :-)no, just joking )... But also the cuts and camera and angles... Every detail is just perfect! I went into this movie several times and I can say only one thing: The intensity of the experience was bigger every time. You can just forget everything around you and get drowned into it. So really, the only thing I can say is, ""how wonderful life is, now it's in the world"".",Moulin Rouge!
1429,kirby579,At Least it was Pretty,6,26 April 2002,"I really did enjoy watching this film, but i would be hesitant to reccomend it to an unsuspecting audience.  The plot was incredibely banal, a golden hearted hooker meets lovelorn poet story.  Which will triumph in the end ""True Love"" or ""Love of Money""?  The suspense might actually get to you, if weren't for the exceedingly effected acting style of the two main characters.  Not to say that all the acting is awful, John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent were fantastic in their supporting roles, as were most of the other minor characters. Once i stopped paying attention to the plot and the lovers, however, i really enjoyed the film.  In addition to Baz Luhrman's eclectic genius, Something must be said for the absolute neon brilliance of Catherine Martin, the production designer (who also did such a fantastic job with Baz's other films, Romeo+Juliet and Strictly Ballroom)as well as the cinematographer Donald McAlpine.  The world they created was absolutely beautiful to watch. Everything visually was stunning to the utmost degree. However, while the gaudy decadence of the set and frantic editing pace appealed to me, it may overwhelm some audience members.  As a rule of thumb, if you don't like fast paced jumpy editing sequences (think MTV or Baz's other big hit Romeo+Juliet), you proboly won't enjoy the visual effects of this film. As a musical i couldn't decide if this made the cut.  Certainely the opening brothel number was fast-paced and exciting, but the majority of the rest of the songs were all sappy love song clips which i thought fell a bit flat. I just didn't feel the excitment of that opening song was ever recaptured throughout the rest of the film.",Moulin Rouge!
1430,StarOnStage,Does Baz have a machine that reads my dreams?,9,4 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge is not going to be accepted by a lot of people.That is not a fact, nor is it my wish, it is my greatest fear.  I loved Moulin Rouge, on a level that is hard to articulate.  And while there were bits that bothered me, such as the giant gun hitting the E. Tower, on the whole it is wonderfully done.It holds one thing above all summer movies this year, it is 98% unique!  The 2% of it that isn't unique is so obscure that only the well read will recognize it.Please go see this movie, please take as many people as you can.",Moulin Rouge!

If you see ONE movie this year, let it be Moulin Rouge!  And, don't let the fact that it's a musical scare you off.  This is like NO musical you've ever seen.  Kidman and McGregor were perfectly cast, as was everyone else!!  The direction was perfect.  The acting was.....were they acting???  I was so lost in the story, I wasn't aware of any acting. The cinematography - spectacular!  Superb editing and continuity!  This movie is an emotional, visual and sensual feast and, without a doubt, one of the finest films I've ever seen.  I'm still stunned from the brilliance and originality of the movie.  As another ""reviewer"" said, see this on the biggest screen you can find.  (I saw it at an Imax.) Don't wait for the video release - it MUST be seen in a theatre and the bigger, the better! I've never reviewed a movie here before and probably won't again.

1434,fhamden,Baby Do It . . . One More Time . . .,10,8 July 2001,"Absolutely fantastic. Fantastic as defined in the dictionary.
The quantum leap beyond Cabaret and All That Jazz.  The medium was used to it's fullest. MR presented highly effective visuals via camera work and cutting - that could not be replicated in a stage production.   But scene after scene was  presented with a unique perspectives that also captured the energy and intimacy of live theatre.  The ultra tight close-ups - left you in a space where you expected to hear the chorus sweat.
Nicole Kidman; to die for. :-)   Ian McGregor's last scene with Kidman - - you would have thought that he was being cast out of Eden. The audience I saw this with, (a full house) applauded  - not only at the end -   but also on several occasions during the movie at the end of song and dance numbers. Eye candy; brain food; heart moving.  What a beautiful piece of work.!!!!!!!!!!!   Go see it before it disappears from the big screen.  Go go go go go  . . . .

I'll keep this review short as you really should just go experience it for yourself, but I want to say that it is undoubtedly a piece of cinema history. The style of the photography, the art direction, the performances, and, yes...the music all combine in a surprisingly moving film.

After hearing that amazing cd, I couldn't wait untill i saw the movie. Who'd thought that a movie about a city that I absolutely hate would make me feel they I do. But Buzz Luhrmann did the movie so... extraordinary. Listening to a 1900 singer singing ""material girl"" or to a pimp singing ""like a virgin"" just made me an addict to this awesome movie. Tough the reaction of many people (among them: My parents) wasn't too enthusiastic, and some even left it in the middle- I still believe that it is one of the best movies created ever, and the Oscars will soon prove me right.",Moulin Rouge!

This a great movie going experience,  you are submerged in the under world of Paris in the end of the 19th Century, where the only revolution happening is that of artist striving to express themselves through their art.

Having seen previously Romeo+Juliet, by the same director, I feared that his interesting ideas were again to be drowned in his visual incontinency. I was wrong: Moulin Rouge does not have a single idea to be drowned anywhere, just pure, empty, incontinency. William Shakespeare was not there to help the director out of his visual mess. Everything that could be bought by money (acting, art direction, costumes) is very good. But not a single idea, or a passion, or any of that sort, dares to surface in this long and boring piece. Curious enough for a movie that stammers about the difference between prostitution and love.",Moulin Rouge!

The love seductive scene between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor was the best in cinematic history, in my opinion.

I am a young film buff and have grown tired of the uninspired, money-driven stories that flood the local multiplexes, so a movie as original and exciting as this is a breathe of fresh air. I had no idea Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor could sing! Just the sheer splendor of the movie had me on cloud nine for the entire length of the picture. (For some reason I could watch Nicole Kidman do anything onscreen for days without getting tired.) Everything was excellent. In the season of mindless shoot-em ups and sci-fi blunders, and would-be comedies, it's refreshing to see a creative movie bold enough to tango with the likes of Pearl Harbor and The Mummy Returns.",Moulin Rouge!

For anyone who believes there is such a thing in love this movie will emotionally move you to unimaginable heights.  Everything about this movie is awesome - the actors, the music, the story, the cinematography, the costumes, the ideas, the humor, etc...Ewan McGregor quickly rose in the chart of my favorite actors. I love him so now, he is a wonderful actor with an amazing voice that I was more than surprised to hear.  Nicole too.  She can sing and she does it well.  Who knew?  Tom maybe.  :)  John Leguizamo is hilarious...he hasn't played such a funny part since Too Wong Foo. The scene where Christian sings ""Your Song"" to Satine is wonderfully beautiful and romantic. This movie didn't even have to try, it had me at hello. :) This movie sends the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions and it is a ride that I will never forget.

Baz Luhrmann proves his genius for writing and directing through this work of cinematic excellence.  The wondrous combination of music with artwork with acting with camera drove me to laughter, tears, and goosebumps, all at just the right moments.  The film achieved at every turn the director's dream of transmitting an emotion from a screen and speakers to the very soul of an audience.  McGregor, Kidman, Broadbent, Roxburg, and Leguizamo meshed in a harmony not seen by me since Hunt and Nicholson in As Good as it Gets.  The characters, the actors, and the acting style fit together perfectly to produce a beautiful film about love, life, and loss.  Never before has a film enthralled me to such an extreme.

1447,joshgilpatrick,"I hate musicals, but I loved Moulin Rouge",10,4 June 2001,"Let me start off by saying, I hate musicals.  Semi-interesting plot that is only slowed down by bad music and cheesy acting.  Moulin Rouge, however made me see it twice.  When I first heard about the movie and watched the preview, I liked the way it looked.  It instantly reminded me of something out of a Tim Burton movie.  When I saw that Ewan McGregor was in it, I was even more excited.  However, in the first 25 minutes, I was beginning to worry that the movie would turn out to be what it was: a french musical. But it significantly calmed down afterwards and room for acting was allowed. The acting of the film was some of the best acting I've seen, especially for a musical.  The music, the mood, the feelings that it inspired, all made me enjoy this movie.  I am very sorry that more people didn't give Moulin Rouge a chance.  Many of the bad reviews that it recieved on the IMDB were from people who walked out on it in the first 30 minutes.  Any fan of modern music and who loves a good story about love should see this movie.  Oh, and if you do see it, try not to take it too seriously.  It is art after all.",Moulin Rouge!
1448,mdepinto,"Incredible, outstanding, a tour de force!",10,5 June 2001,"From the opening credits to the last frame, Moulin Rouge was so visually spectacular, imaginative and surreal, I was devastated by it. I have never seen a movie so visually pleasing. The performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were terrific, touching and funny. The whole cast was superb. The popular music set in Paris 1900 was incredible. I highly recommend this film. Sit back and enjoy ... you won't believe your eyes.",Moulin Rouge!
1449,anneewo,"One of my favourite films, ever",10,9 October 2001,"This film knocked me out. The amazing sets, imaginative use of the music and the excellent cast were all brilliant. Turning ""Roxanne"" into a tango was inspired. Loved the dancing,too. I've read reviews that said Ewan McGregor was the weak link - UTTER TOSH!! When Christian was pleading with Satine not to sleep with the duke, I was in tears. As for Nicole - she was beautiful - and no, I'm not gay!A hugely entertaining film. Loved it",Moulin Rouge!
1450,popstar3002,Never have I seen such a delightful spectacle...,10,1 June 2001,"This movie would be wonderful, whether it had no picture or no sound. Without the picture, you will miss the BEST cinematography (in my opinion) ever, but, you will witness a touching, musical, emotional, and sometimes funny story of Satine, the courtesan, and Christian, the poor writer. Without the sound, you WILL see the cinematography,but you will probably be able to figure out what is happening.  However, you would miss many original songs, and clever modern day medleys.  This movie is wonderful! GO SEE IT!",Moulin Rouge!

And the wonderful use of music that I've come to expect from Baz Luhrman. Love is like oxygen...love is a many-splendoured thing...love lift's us up where we belong...all you need is love!Given, the general ill-fated love is nothing new, but Luhrman has certainly placed his mark on the genre with Moulin Rouge! A must see which is destined to become a classic.",Moulin Rouge!
1452,kikiandmiki,Moulin Rouge is overrated!,1,8 February 2002,"Now, I'm only 23 years old.  So I'm not criticizing this movie because I wasn't raised on MTV.  Nor am I a conservative 23 year old.  My ""recent"" modern-style movies are ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Fight Club.""  Nor am I a fan of depressing, dreary movies.  I also like romantic, period pieces like `Sense and Sensibility' and `A Room With A View"" (Which both of them I also consider funny and witty comedies of manners). I'm also a fan of Luhrmann's ""Romeo and Juliet."" I guess generally like hyper-camera work and romance to be separate from each other.  I associate dark lighting and fast camera work with darker issues.  I admit, I like compartmentalization.
""Moulin Rouge"" to me was a big disappointment.  To me, `Being John Malkovich' is a creative movie because it was creative visually and plot-wise.  `Moulin Rouge' is creative visually-MUCH more so than BJM I add-but the plot line  is rather cliché.  And the character's names Christian and Satine?  Can you be more cheesy? Or does Baz mean Christian and Satan? Now, that's intriguing.",Moulin Rouge!
1453,duimsday,AN EYEFUL!!!!,7,21 January 2004,"BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHY!!! Kidman and McGregor ably handle singing duties.

And nobody needs LIKE A VIRGIN to be performed  for so long!!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1454,jefferey31,Best Musical - EVER!,10,25 August 2001,"Although I've been a professional and semi-professional musician  for over twenty years and an avid movie fan for over thirty years, most musicals have always bored me.  Except for Jesus Christ Superstar, I don't think I've ever seen any more than once.  That is until today.  Moulin Rouge grabbed a hold of me and would not let go!  Only five or ten minutes into the movie I knew I was in for a real treat.  By the time we had reached the half-way point, I knew that I already wanted to see it again.  And again I did.  Immediately following the conclusion of the movie, I ran to the lobby to purchase another ticket.  While I had heard Nicole Kidman sing a few bars before, nothing prepared me for the real talent she has.  Furthermore, to listen to Ewan McGregor sing was worth the price of admission alone.  Not only does this movie make great use of modern music (some very modern and some recently modern) but it utilizes musical bits and pieces and storylines from other movies, plays, and even operas.  You'll even find lyrics from songs you may know being sung to different melodies and to other familiar tunes as well.  Watch closely, you may even see a few parodies of some other familiar characters, too.  It seems the more you know about music, movies, and the theatre, the more fun you'll have with this wonderful gem.  This one's the next in line for my video collection!",Moulin Rouge!
1455,superiorityman,This film has ADD,3,6 June 2001,"The easiest way to describe this film is that this movie has Attention Deficit Disorder and only very rarely does it take its ritolin. And when it does slow down, the movie still isn't good. Most of the film is comprised of meaningless cuts at an extremely rapid pace so that things are not on the screen for more than half a second.  And this just hurt my eyes.  Especially because the colors are vibrant and really leap out.  Its like watching a music video which is already too fast on fast forward.When the film is not going off at this crazy pace, it is then comprised of extreme close-ups.  The camera is so close on peoples faces that most of the time they do not even fit on the screen.  And for some of the people, like the owner of Moulin Rouge, it is way too close and down right scary.  A problem that I have heard most people had with the movie, if they had a problem with it, was the music.  And that was one of the few tolerable things with it.  Unlike the absolutely ridiculous music of A Knight's Tale, this music is incorporated into the movie well.  At least here they make it like the music is original, even though it isn't.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't enjoy the music, but its at least tolerable.There is not much good about this film.  The story is 100% unoriginal and the film hurts your eyes.  The tagline says that Club Moulin Rouge is an experience you will never forget.  And that's true, Club Moulin Rouge is an experience you will never forget, but not because it was good, but because you will get ADD from watching it.",Moulin Rouge!
1456,hollyfaupel,My all time favourite film!,10,13 March 2019,"To start with, its directed by Baz Lurhman so you know its going to be good...
But I never expected to be obsessed with this film 11 years after I first watched it for a school project!Considering the bohemian/absinthe induced-vibe that makes it all so unrealistic and fantastical, from a signing moon, to the green fairy played by Minogue; the talented actors, Kidman, McGregor and Broadbent are stunning and make it all very believable. You find yourself routing for the protagonists and detesting the antagonist - just as any movie should make it's audience feel.It is so full off mixed emotions, all the way through. It is somber to start, with a beautiful opening sequence featuring establishing shots and the wonderful character Toulouse, played magnificently by Leguizamo! Haunting, funny and tear-jerking, it really is not to be missed!",Moulin Rouge!
1457,vasiliapapapostolou,An underrated masterpiece,10,12 April 2020,"Moulin Rouge! is the best film I saw after many years, I haven't felt so excited over a film for a really long time. Baz Luhrmann managed to create such a unique and incomparable movie and he took a big risk: he created a fantastic world beyond the spectator's imagination. You feel like you're a part of the story, while the characters are likeable, (well, except for the Duke of course) and you find yourself rooting for Christian and Satine's, up until a point, secret love affair, with the hope that they'll get their chance for a happy ending. You get attached to the characters while there are quite a few humorous and pleasant scenes.Nicole Kidman gives an exquisite and unforgettable performance in the role of the most famous Moulin Rouge courtesan, she shines and she gives her everything to the role: she sings, she dances, she cries, she even shows her comical side. Ewan McGregor is a true gem, you can't help but fall in love with him when he sings to Elton John's Your Song. He incarnates a challenging role and he has, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. Both of the protagonists go beyond their limits, while their chemistry is surpassing and very believable.The soundtrack is also a very strong part of the film, specifically Come What May and the chilling El Tango De Roxanne, both of them causing undescribable feelings to the viewer. As for El Tango De Roxanne, I never thought that a five-minute scene had the ability to be a true masterpiece. For me it's one of the best scenes in cinematic history as it goes from the tango, the rhythm, the infinite feelings it causes to the pain in Satine's sacrifice so she can turn her home into a better place. It makes you feel a hundred emotions all at once and you feel your heart racing, goosebumps and tears welling up your eyes as you feel for the heroine who has to pretend once again so she can make the Duke believe what he wants to believe.The entire movie is a breath of fresh air between movies with similar scenarios and the director breaks ground with his innovative approach despite the difficulties during filming. It deserved the Oscars it got and it causes a rollercoaster of emotions to the viewer, it even makes you want to fall in love so deeply that you act like a complete fool and sing your heart out on top of an elephant. Lastly, apart from the spectacle and the beautiful, colourful costumes that steal the show, it offers many beautiful messages such as the fact that it's better to have love and loss than no love at all and that, as Christian greatly put it, ""the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return"".",Moulin Rouge!
1458,glendabyron,excess is not always a virtue,5,23 April 2006,"so many people i know really liked this movie. unfortunately, i am not one of them. but at least i know why, too much. baz luhrmann, brilliant director, a visionaire, i just wish he knew when to say when. my impression of this film was that he felt the need to take every cool idea he ever had and put them all in the same movie. as a result of this overkill i found it difficult to pay attention to what was going on because i never really knew what was the intended center of attention, as opposed to extraneous contributions. had there been half as much...crap in this movie i would have loved it. it has a great story, it is a brilliant idea, and an amazing cast. unfortunately when all put together, with about a dozen other factors of equal intensity, it is overkill. like wearing plaid and polka-dots...and then putting a bright red bow on your head.",Moulin Rouge!
1459,sp_pixie,Art at its absolute finest,10,5 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge, despite its somewhat ecstatic beginning, is a genuine vision of the Bohemian ideals so often revered in the film: Truth, Beauty, Love, and Freedom. The film flows with such shocking beauty heart-wrenching honesty that it is difficult to remember yourself throughout the course of the story. A delightfully eccentric orgy of images and sounds, Moulin Rouge makes one cry from every pore in their body, makes them long for love and reality, despite its surreal and imaginative basis. The movie sets its own standards and guidelines. Baz Lurhmann is truly brilliant, and his creativity truly shines through this shimmering jewel of art and passion.",Moulin Rouge!
1460,mogaki,Spectacular Spectacular creates a stir,8,21 May 2001,"This is a visually stunning film! It is an incredible treat for the senses. This one must be seen on a BIG screen with BIG sound to be properly appreciated. The soundtrack and performances are wonderful, but this movie gets highest marks for production design and direction. The unique, fantastical world created here is reminiscent of the magic done by Jeunet and Caro but with some Peter Pan dust thrown in. The story is essentially very short and seems stretched out, but the extra space is filled with lots of moving fun. This is a period piece that doesn't stay in any one period. The special effects seem groundbreaking, and the refreshing thing is that the big budget F/X aren't used for car chases, fighting scenes or aerial acrobatics. It's high action romance. Highly recommended.",Moulin Rouge!
1461,theol_ludwigvan,A complete movie.,7,14 March 2002,"In my opinion you should watch this movie, because it describes life. Director's point of view on life is schopenhauerian: suffer is a part of it and we have to accept that. There is also another part of the movie, when everybody seems to believe in love: i think the final message is not that. It is not a movie about love, freedom; but about life, suffering and pain.",Moulin Rouge!
1462,vonnegreat,"Visually stunning, otherwise vacant",6,9 April 2002,"I really have mixed feelings about this one. It truly is a film like no other I have ever seen. The cinematography is absolutely incredible, no doubt about it; whatever artistic Oscars the film procured were well-deserved. The world that the film creates is stunning and the amazingly free movement of the camera solidifies spatial relations and brings the different locations together into a coherent whole. It really is fantastic work. That said, I didn't like--borderline hated--the film. The vast majority of ""dialogue"" is actually song lyrics (often rehashed) from familiar songs of the past 30 or so years. In this, it can be said that the film is often ""catchy"" and certainly caused the occasional smile, but really has nothing worthwhile to say. The plot would make Walt Disney jealous of its simplicity and really has nothing to add to the traditional ""boy and girl want to be together but something's blocking the way"". Perhaps it could be seen to be making a societal comment in its over-intentional hodge-podge of pre-existent ideas. At any rate, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this formula still brings about success... But it was really irritating hearing the same trite, already-familiar lyrics repeated again and again. It was a musical melodrama pumped with so much false energy that I felt embarrassed for the actors at times and just wished it would stop. The acting of the two main characters was certainly average at best. The fact that Nicole Kidman was lauded for this performance truly makes me ill. But the incidental characters in the film were mostly much more solid and interesting, especially the ""manager"" of Moulin Rouge. I must wrap up: visually it's absolutely stunning and certainly worth watching, but it is emotionally vacant and meaningless.",Moulin Rouge!
1463,rob99,Nicole and Ewan shine in Baz's magnificent realisation of a wildly decadent past Paris!,10,20 December 2001,"Baz Luhrmann's magnificent film stands as his best work to date. Utilising the very best in digital wizzardry his team has produced a most stunningly fantastical visual treat that has to be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated; for there is so much detail in this film it is sadly diminished when viewed on even a large t.v screen. That being said it was with great pleasure the film was reviewed again in the DVD format; with a lump in my throat I again heard Nic and Ewan sing that wonderful Elephant Love Medley in DTS, experienced the raw emotion of El Tango de Roxanne and felt as if I was at the Moulin Rouge during the Can-Can sequence.The production design, sound, musical scoring, costumes all outstanding and hopefully recognised by many industry nominations. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor head an extremely talented cast that give their all for Baz. This is the most entertaining film I have ever seen and cannot recommend it too highly to anyone looking for a stunning visual and aural feast. See it.",Moulin Rouge!

1465,Fantom07,A Modern Movie Musical,10,13 June 2001,"I love movie musicals.  The first one I ever saw was ""Singing in the Rain"" when I was in the first grade.  I loved it, and every other musical made during the fifties; the age of movie musicals. Movie Musicals of the fifties took the favorite music of the time, put a cute plot behind it, got some people who could sing and dance, and shot the film.  The audiences loved it.  Unfortunatly, that genre of movies faded away, and the movie musical died. . . until director Baz Lurhman brought it back. Moulin Rouge, starring Ewan McGregor and Nichole Kidman, is a fantastic movie musical, with all the qualities of one.  I feel that many people are looking at it from the wrong angle.  It is a great musical, WONDERFUL singing (McGregor and Kidman both have fantastic voices), and the color and costumes are great. Lurhman combined his first two movies (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet) and created a fabulous display of color, music, and emotion. Lurhman's sence of color is fantastic, with the two themes of Red and White sprinkled through out the movie.  There are lots of little details if one looks close enough. My one complaint is that in the Elephant Love Medley, they really didn't need the ""I Will Always Love You"" in there.  Blech!!",Moulin Rouge!
1466,skwankwan,What an experience...!,10,6 June 2001,"Indeed, Moulin Rouge has struck many emotions throughout the showcasing. Moulin Rouge is a collage of laughter, tears, and pain.

1469,lolalalalola,Moulin Rouge is What Artistic Cinematography is All About,10,21 June 2006,"""Spectacular, Spectacular"", the bohemians in Moulin Rouge couldn't have said it better. It is a film that is equally a classic, a work of art, and a musical. It is also brilliantly made in all its aspects, it is strongly emotional, a celebration of beauty, its soundtrack is nothing less than genius, the performances are truly memorable, and it is visually outstanding. This film is an extraordinary production that can only get better every time one sees it.In Moulin' Rouge the theme and sub-themes of the story are made clear by the characters themselves, ""Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and Love"", of course with love as the main theme. Christian, played by Ewan McGregor, is obsessed with love even though he has never fallen in love himself, the main plot revolves around his ideals about love. Throughout the movie Satine and Christian fight for love only to prove that it conquers all, as they beautifully play it in the song ""Come What May"". This is their secret song, and no matter what obstacles their love will be stronger than adversity. The whole film revolves around these ideals of the bohemian revolution, or better said: ""the children of the revolution"". So many films have been made in honor of love, yet this one stands out because it pays tribute to love with art, music, and consequently passion. It is impossible not to fall in love watching this film even if it is for the thousandth time.The story line of the movie gives allusion to several classics, such as ""La Bohème"", ""La Traviata"", and ""Orpheus in the Underworld"" (IMDB Trivia), yet it stands out for its originality. Another movie which it alludes to is, a stronger classic than the latter, is ""Romeo and Juliette"". Even if the audience is as cynical as Satine, Christian and the rest of the bohemians will draw them into romantic bliss.Even though the movie is a Tragedy it is made into greatness by the very basic ideals of the Greek Tragedy: it had to be made with such perfection and beauty that the spectator would walk away with a duality of emotion, both sadness for the heartbreaking outcome of the story and joy for the admiration of what they have just witnessed. What is more, whenever a movie starts with the ending the viewer can foresee that the film will be so great that is doesn't need a shocking ending, the movie's story line is enough.The acting in the movie was also worthy of awe, all five main actors, Ewan McGregor as Christian, Nicole Kidman as Satine, John Leguizamos as Toulouse, Jim Broadbent as Zidler, and Richard Roxburgh as The Duke made an incredible performance, and by performance I mean acting and singing. A couple of these actors had a previous positive reputation for their acting, however their singing will sure cause a shocking impression on the audience. The most memorable performances were those of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, they were so intensely in character that it is very hard to watch the movie objectively without getting absorbed into the sentiment of the film.Nevertheless, even though the singing of the actors was incredible it would have been nothing without the elaborate composition of the songs. All of the songs were covers for the most part yet it was seldom obvious. Most of the songs were individually composed of lyrics of many singers and bands and they were redone to fit the movie. These songs are so perfect for every situation that it would have been easier to compose new lyrics than to gather lines from other composers. Purchasing the soundtrack is almost as worthy of getting the movie itself.In addition, the costumes and the sets were so elaborate that they were as important to the film's success as the actors' performance, the music, and the plot. The movie takes place in Paris; yet it is a fantasy landscape of Paris that almost purposefully looks like a miniature replica, this setting adds to the fantastic world in which the film takes place. All of the inside settings are striking for their elaborateness and artistic quality, they add to the movie's creative, elegant, sexy, and dreamlike spirit.Moulin Rouge can also be described as very bizarre and this may be the reason why it does not appeal to all audiences. One of the main elements that make it so is the way the camera is used. It is not at all used in a conventional way; on the contrary, it goes to extremes so that it makes it unconventional. It is a combination of rapid tracking shots, spinning, coordination with the song (specifically in the song Spectacular Spectacular), and more. Even though the usage of the camera makes the movie very bizarre it is almost essential for its artistic structure.Many aspects such as the acting, singing, setting, costumes, use of color, camera movement, and theme, come together to make this movie into a brilliant work of art. However, as great as it is it does not appeal to everyone; because it is so unconventional it may not arise all of the emotions that it should, it may only cause confusion. Despite its unpopularity in certain groups, it is venerated by others. Moulin Rouge was the first acclaimed musical in this time and was the first of many more to come. It is also one of those movies that will be timeless and will only become better with time. Moulin Rouge can be concisely expressed as having heart.",Moulin Rouge!
1470,DrLecterPhD,"Some people are not understanding ""Moulin Rouge""...",10,10 June 2001,"While scanning through the endless praises of ""Moulin Rouge"", I couldn't help that the reviews which criticized it were focused on one large subject:that the story of MR was completely useless and/or absurdly non-unique. Obviously, the reviewers know nothing of the filmmaker, Baz Luhrmann, or his extreme cinematic techniques that he has branded himself with as tradition. Luhrmann, previous director of ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Romeo + Juliet"" always uses his films as ""upgrades"" of previously famous stories.  ""Strictly Ballroom"", for example, uses the biblical tale of David and Goliath set to a ballroom showdown, while ""Romeo + Juliet"" gets the 90's gangster-mob upgrade in their classical Shakespeare story.  ""Moulin Rouge"", of course, does nonetheless with Luhrmann.  He uses a Greek mythological tale set to the crazy Bohèmian lifestyle of upper-Paris.I do not berate people for not enjoying ""Moulin Rouge"" (I, however, thought it was absolutely incredible), but I feel that many of these reviewers need to not only know the aspect from which the film is taking, but to watch the ENTIRE film (do not walk out of the theater and expect people to read your review with understanding) and then judge it -- do not discuss something you really do not know what you are talking about.",Moulin Rouge!
1471,kahillis,The Ultimate Post Modern Experience,10,2 June 2001,"If someone asked me to sum up the essence of ""Moulin Rouge"" in one sentence, I would have to say, ""an ultimate cliche with extraordinary originality.""  I realize this is a contradiction, but what wasn't about this film? Outside of ""My Fair Lady"" I have never been able to stomach a musical, so when I went to see ""Moulin Rouge"" I was expecting to go to laugh at it. Strangely enough, I consistently found myself laughing with the film rather than at it (as well as crying). Every time a new scene emerged I thought, ""here's my chance to scoff,"" but the film was able to pull me into the other direction EVERY TIME. If anyone wants to know what Post Modern is: this is it.  This film took pop culture and made it art...how is that possible? I'm still trying to figure it out.The film, first of all, cannibalizes itself. It's a story about a man writing a play based on the story as it unfolds, and he is writing out the story after the fact. So it's a story within a story within a story. But it is never confusing, surprisingly enough.  Secondly, there is a romance. How does one make a movie about a romance of this nature--very cliche--and pull it off? Ask the director and writer of the film and you'll find out.  I still can't believe I liked the romantic aspect, but I did. Thirdly, the film is a mixture of genres I haven't seen since ""Blade Runner"" (although I wouldn't compare the two)--a musical, comedy, tragedy, fairy tale, with some hints of film noir. Fourthly, the film, I don't think, has any original score; rather, it uses a mixture of music from the last thirty years--some so unlikely to be put together that one has to check themselves to make sure they are really hearing the song(s) they are hearing. What I find interesting about the score is that Kidman can sing ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" while the men below sing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" both in their original tunes, and they work together as if it was all the same song. And fifthly, the movie is obviously a parody of musicals (and parodies are almost impossible to pull of these days without being banal), which is why the mixture of music, the love story, etc. can be well received without indignant guffaws.Well, there were a couple of people who did guffaw and snicker...but they were sixteen year-old teenage girls with their boyfriends who went to go see the movie because of the Madame Marmalade video on MTV--they wouldn't know parody if Christina Aguilara told them personally. And many have been asking if McGregor and Kidman were lip syncing. Actually, no. Everyone in the film sang their own music and did it live (of course, I'm sure there was some ""fiddling"" around with the sound quality).Anyone with intelligence could see ""Moulin Rouge"" for what it is: a great film. Over the top? Yes. Silly? Yes. Contradictory? Yes. But strangely enough, it all works because it knows it is all of those things and plays off of them. I walked out of that movie thoroughly surprised at my respect for it. It was worth every dollar I spent and I'll spend it again.",Moulin Rouge!
1472,morrell,A return to ideals and a value based life using a love story,10,23 June 2001,"We have only seen Moulin Rouge five times so far, but I love it. I don't understand how anyone could not love it. The colors, dancing, and music are nearly overwhelming. The romance from many viewpoints is completely enjoyable. The ability of the director to bring the viewer's mind into a certain frame through the use of music that brings the viewer back to times and experiences in their own life, many times matching the storyline, is remarkable. We thoroughly enjoy this movie and plan to keep going to see and and absolutely buy it when it comes out. But, see it in the theatre, especially one with the best sound you can get. I have been so won over to Nicole Kidman by this movie. And Ewan McGregor obviously enjoys acting so much that you just want to keep watching him. The part of Toulouse was played exceedlingly well, and I feel that the scene where Toulouse speaks to Christian when Christian is lying in bed, should win an Oscar all by itself!",Moulin Rouge!
1473,Hypnotizer182,Moulin Rouge brings the art of film to a new level,10,27 December 2001,"One of the best films of the 90's and I will tell you why. First of all, one of the most important things to remember is that this is part of Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain series (along with Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet) in which he strives to make the audience aware that they are in fact watching a movie. He has used dancing, Shakespeare's language, and musical numbers in the three movies in the series respectively to do this. But Moulin Rouge does more. Luhrman creates a cinema in Moulin Rouge which is a feast for the eyes and a feast for the mind. He has an acute sense of spectacle in the piece. He takes the genre of ""cinema"" and moves it forward in. Saying that it's ok to make a musical in 2001, and ok to take the film in and out of fantasy whenever he wants. It's this pushing forward that makes the movie so great with new innovations in editing, sounds, graphics, and storytelling. It also helps that he had a fantastic cast including the wonderful talents of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, who not only perform well on an acting plane, but sing beautifully. Even their singing style does not imitate that of the classical musicals. It is the film of the future in many ways and it starts right now.",Moulin Rouge!
1474,timmi002,Spectacular Spectacular,10,8 June 2001,"After I saw this movie, I could think of only 2 words to describe it - CLEVER and BRILLIANT.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are amazing in the lead roles.  Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo are excellent in their very funny supporting roles as well.  They can all sing, they can dance and they show such passion and emotion throughout.  The music is incredible!  I never buy soundtracks to films, but after seeing this film, I just had to have it. I have seen it twice now and would recommend this film to anyone who likes music, dancing, romance, comedy and quirky Being John Malkovich type humor. You never know Baz Luhrman is going to do next.  Being inside his mind would be the wildest ride.  The film is visually stunning from the Elephant to his take on 1900 Paris.  If you like ""different"" and ""extraordinary"" then this is the movie for you.",Moulin Rouge!

A more acute observation in the theater I attended was the number of people who walked out in the first fifteen minutes.Those of us who watched the entire movie were reasonably well rewarded.The use of contemporary pop/rock lyrics as musical dialog was interesting, characters outrageous, vivid costuming and the sets reminiscent of other Art Films I've enjoyed. At the same time, the story line was a bit weak.Worth a look as pure entertainment. Pretty off beat.Enjoy.

1476,anmaron,Surprise - Surprise,9,1 November 2001,"I went in without major expectations. I read many comments about the film and most of them dealt with the performance of Nicole - so I wanted to know.... In some aspects I can understand some criticism about some missing emotions in her character, but at the bottom line it was a real positive surprise. Ewan McGregor is great and the other characters are so strong!Also the colours, the cuts and the music is extraordinary.Such a great idea to bring modern songs in the time of the Moulin Rouge in the 20s.",Moulin Rouge!
1477,Livvy1,Amazing!,10,11 June 2001,"The opening was impressive enough, little did I know the film was going to get even better. I walked out of that movie theater with my faith in Hollywood restored. It has been quite a while since I have seen a movie this good. The music is so outstanding that I wanted to get up and dance with every scene. More impressive were the shots, each one filmed as though it was a piece of artwork. The sets must have cost a small fortune. I couldn't be more pleased with this film. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.",Moulin Rouge!
1478,schokobaerchen,What a great movie!,10,31 October 2001,"I think I've never written a movie review before...and certainly not in English, but I really have to say that I love this movie so much!! The plot is great, I mean, surly, sometimes it is a bit too trashy, but there is so much love in it...wow! And I can also tell you, the soundtrack is terrific! This music will definitely enchant you! And I am still deeply impressed by the voices of Nicole and Ewan. I had never thought that they could sing so well. This is one of those movies you love or you hate...and there is nothing in between. But if you believe in love and you like romantic music, great acting and costumes,... I can just recommend this movie to you!!",Moulin Rouge!
1479,jazzy_cat_2002,Excellent,10,6 July 2006,"Like the song, this movie was Spectacular. I had wanted to see this movie for no particular reason, then I found out Nicole Kidman was in it and I had to see it. I am so glad I did. I bought the soundtrack soon afterward and I listen to it every day. This was one of Nicole's most excellent of movies. I was astonished by the fact that the stars in the movie were the singers as well. Nicole could have started a great beginning to a singing career. I believe Nicole could most definitely have the potential to start a singing career. I would hope that anyone reading this who is a fan of romance movies or even just huge fans of Nicole Kidman themselves, would treat themselves by watching Moulin Rouge!.",Moulin Rouge!
1480,katonapille,"A romantic, visual delight!",10,29 May 2001,"It's not very often a movie's visuals, music and romance stick in your head. I cannot stop thinking about Moulin Rouge!  Director Baz Luhrmann is nothing short of a genius.  The costumes, the sets, the songs, the editing, the vision...what a breath of fresh air!  Ewan and Nicole create musical magic.  I laughed, I cried, I sang along.  May this be the summer's biggest hit!  Long live Baz Luhrmann and his movie musical!",Moulin Rouge!
1481,KDpeffley,Nothing short of Fantastic!,10,5 July 2001,"Wow!  I'm in love with this movie.  I rarely, if ever, return to the theater to see a movie for a second time.  The last time I did this I was about 10 years old and my mother gave me hell when I got home.  In the last 3 weeks, I've seen Moulin Rouge 3 times, and I still haven't tired of it.This movie gives and gives and gives, never holding back.  The combination of the beautiful sets, the story, the love songs, and the bold, bold courageous way in which all of it was done all combine to make a great movie, not just Oscar worthy, but a classic that may last years.  The set design is lush, full of brilliant eye popping colors and gorgeous sets depicting turn of 20th century Paris and the dark ""underworld"" of the Moulin Rouge theater.  Particularly, I loved the set in the Satine's bedroom, the vivid red and blue colors, hearts within hearts, and, of course, the elephant building where she lived.I'm not a lover of pop music, but I loved the way all of the music was used to tell the story of Satine, the courtesan, and Christian, the poet. Almost every time a song was introduced, the audience would titter as people recognized the most popular songs of the 70's 80's and 90's--which may or may not have been the movie's intent.  Nevertheless, each time this happened, I felt a playfulness here that eventually resolved itself into something deeper and more profound.  It was as if the movie was saying go ahead, let's have some fun here, but we're going to take you further than you originally expected, and I believe that Moulin Rouge did this from the very start, crescendoing to the very end, taking us deeper and deeper. Take for instance, when the song Touched Like a Virgin starts, we can't think of anything but Madonna, but upon further reflection, this song speaks so truthfully of Satine who's heart is opened for the very first time to the possibilities of love with a poor poet.  In this new context we find how well this song speaks to our feelings of open heartedness (virginity of the heart) when we are in love.Lastly, I was very taken with the story of the poet's love for the beautiful courtesan and her inner struggle between her love for him and her lust for wealth and fame.  The theme of love--the most important thing to know is to love and to know that you are loved in return--that love is at the core of our very humanity--that in spite of egoistic distractions, love is how we truly find ourselves.",Moulin Rouge!
1482,witkokodanwin,Perfect Eye Candy,10,11 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge was as wonderful a piece of eye candy as I've ever seen. The music was incredibly inventive, creative, and playful, and the visuals were as addictive as the ""Green Fairy"" that the characters regularly imbibed. Baz Lurhmann has scored another hit with the third installment of his ""Red Curtain Trilogy"". His flare for theater and dramatics really transfers quite beautifully to this film production. An impressive achievement! I've recommended this film to everyone that I know, and all who have seen it have loved it.",Moulin Rouge!
1483,lookinatme99,Best love story in the world,9,26 May 2001,"Moulin Rouge is the most wonderful movie I have seen in a very long time. I can't believe it received some bad reviews,  because I don't have a single bad word to say about it. The raw passion of this movie makes you feel the emotions of the characters as though you were there with them. The dancing and singing are fantastic. As far as I'm concerned, the story in Moulin Rouge is the best love story in the world, and beats out even Romeo and Juliet. This movie has everything, even humour, which I wasn't expecting. I completely loved it and recommend it to anyone.",Moulin Rouge!
1484,ksgibson,"Most amazing, better than The Notebook",10,28 January 2007,I hate musicals usually. and i had scene the ending twice before wanting to the whole movie until my neighbor wanted me to watch it. After the first viewing i couldn't stop singing the songs. Amazingly enough i own the movie and watch probably twice a week. If you are looking for a romance movie but is fun and outspoken this is the movie for you. I am actually watching the movie right now. Whats amazing about this movie is that Christian (Ewan McGregor) ruins the movie in the beginning but you forget he's telling the story. You will be amazed at how this movie was put together extremely fast in the beginning and slows down dramatically in the middle so you get lost in this story. I recommend someone doing a sequel because after you see it you don't want it to end. I recommend buying the Soundtracks or you will be depressed.,Moulin Rouge!
1485,shallow_grave,AMAZING!!!,10,2 June 2001,"This review is about truth, beauty, freedom, and, above all things, love. The truth-better films are made by film makers who aren't concerned with ticket sales, just their vision. The beauty-well, that's the film itself. The freedom-we must allow films to take us places. And love-that's all we really need, but it can't conquer all.As a film ""critic"", I try to keep myself at a distance from the films I review, but every now and then, I see a movie that I become totally enthralled with. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of these movies, and ""Moulin Rouge"" is the latest .""Moulin Rouge"" is simply one of the most pleasant movie-watching experiences I've ever had, since Ive extensively started watching film in 1995. It is a bewildering, magical, funny, touching, and romantic tale that combines the four ideals that I expounded upon on the outset of this review. Director Baz Luhrman (Romeo + Juliet) has blown me away once again. At it's simplest, ""Moulin Rouge"" is a rock musical, featuring everything from Nirvana to old school Madonna to the Police, and it all fits PERFECTLY. After I saw its soundtrack listing, I bought the CD, and it has been getting nonstop rotation in my player ever since. But labeling ""Moulin Rouge"" as a musical limits it, because it's a visual dream and sometimes nightmare.""Moulin Rouge"" tells the story of Christian (played magnificently by Ewan McGregor), a naive young writer who preaches the four, before-mentioned, ideals like they are his personal creed, because, quite simply, they are. Due to an impromptu meeting with four Bohemian musical writers, especially a dwarf (don't ask), played by John Leguizamo, Christian gains access to the titular nightclub, where he meets the club's ""sparkling diamond"", Satine (Nicole Kidman), a performer/courtesan, who instantly enraptures our young protagonist. The only problem is that Satine has been promised, exclusively, to the Duke of Worcester, who has promised that as long as Satine is his, he will fund the Moulin Rouge. Also, as we, the audience, are shown early on, Satine is slowly dying from tuberculosis. Not surprisingly, this is a recipe for disaster, but Luhrman stages it all with a fun house intensity that never stops until the end credits roll.I only have one regret after seeing ""Moulin Rouge"", and that's the fact that I will never have the experience of seeing it for the first time again, because it truly is an experience. The first thirty minutes speeds along at almost a sickening pace, much to the point that people nationwide have reportedly walked out. Good. If they can't take it, I don't want them. What Baz Luhrman has made here is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's that good. It is the closest thing I have ever seen capture what it truly means to be in love. As one of my movie-watching companions honestly stated: ""I want to fall in love like that.""Also, I'm kind of bias about the movie, because it stars the love of my life, Ms. Kidman. When she first appears in the movie, dropping from the heavens on a swing, I started swooning. Her performance was the best I've ever seen of her, at that's saying a lot, but every actor in the movie fit his/her role perfectly, and that all comes back to the director.Not much more can be said of the director, Baz Luhrman, but after seeing ""Pearl Harbor"" last week, there's truly a contrast. In ""Pearl Harbor"", you had a director and producer who were aching to create another ""Titanic""/ ""Saving Private Ryan"" in order to win the awards which their film won't even be nominated. In ""Moulin Rouge"", you have a director who, quite adamantly, put his heart, soul, and every fiber of his being into his film. You can tell how much he loved making this movie in every frame of it. Well, if you haven't guessed it yet, I really liked ""Moulin Rouge"", and, if nothing else, I leave you with a quote from the film. ""The greatest lesson you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return."" I love this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1486,beezur,a visual feast,10,20 July 2001,"i think moulin rouge was a real break through film,perhaps ahead of it's time. i'm surprised it isn't a huge hit. although in an age of middle of the road hollywood films, where car chase scenes, and gore rule, it could be just to original, and artsy for most folks. at first i thought i would be annoyed by the cover songs, but much to my surprise, i found them very well done. visually this movie is incredible. i loved the cast, especially nicole kidman, she looked like old hollywood star's did. i was delighted by her comedy sexual antics. great spoofy edge to the whole film. it was a bit like gilbert and sullivan meets busby berkley on acid. i felt like i had been there for the summer of love. a must for anyone who likes theater, or musicals, incredible sets, great dancing, the costumes were oscar worthy as was the set design. if i had trouble with any part of it, perhaps the editing required a seat belt. i loved it.",Moulin Rouge!

1489,curlsss,"A ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" Romance",10,4 May 2020,"It all started in 1899 when Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young English poet, travels to Paris to pursue his writing career. Soon after arriving in Paris, he meets a group of Bohemians that talk him into writing a musical that would be performed at the Moulin Rouge, the most famous underworld night club in Paris. Later on, Christian had a meeting setup with Satine (Nicole Kidman), the courtesan of the night club. Christian meets with Satine and he falls head over heels in love with her, as she does him, but there was one small problem. Satine was told by Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the club's owner, that she was meeting with the Duke (Richard Roxburgh). The Duke was interested in investing in the club and to make Satine a real actress for a small price, to have Satine in his possession forever. Satine was thrilled to have fallen in love with the Duke, until she realized it was not him, instead she had fallen for a penniless writer.
Love is the central and most powerful theme of Moulin Rouge. Not only is it shown between two people, but it is also shown with Satine and the other dancers at the Moulin Rouge. They are all in love with the thought of being real stars one day that they will do anything to get there, including work in a night club. The director of the movie does a wonderful job making love the central theme with lighting and angles. The lighting dims around the background activity and extra lighting goes onto the characters during intense romantic scenes. Also, the director films at many different angels in the movie. He switches between first person angles and third person angles. He does this to allow you to not only feel the main characters emotions, but you also get to feel the background characters emotions. The movie, Moulin Rouge, will take you on a crazy journey of love and grief, and will have your eyes glued to the television the entirety of the film.",Moulin Rouge!
1490,rbrokx,What an addled mess...,3,14 January 2002,"Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are fantastic actors, but come on!  How is this movie supposed to hold anyone's attention?

Eventually I had to switch it off.Ideal for people who like listening to two radio stations at once.",Moulin Rouge!
1491,InLuvWithBeck,Incredible,10,16 July 2001,"This is my new favorite movie. I loved it. My cousins had told me they had loved it. So they invited me to see it with them. It was probably the best movie I had ever seen. I thought I had loved movies before. But they all look like garbage now that I have seen this. The only thing that comes even close to this is Disney's ""The Lion King"", which is nothing like Moulin Rouge, but is the closest I can think of to pure excellence other than MR.Even though I had seen the plot a million times before, it was special this time. The costumes, cinematography, coloring, etc. were all great. But nothing could compare to the singing. Nicole Kidman was terrific. But Ewan McGregor was exceptional. His voice had just melted in my heart. His voice itself actually made me cry(and I rarely cry), not just the movie(which is sad). I loved the way they would use modern songs. They fit so well. I especially loved ""Like A Virgin"", which was very funny.So overall, this is an excellent movie. *10 out of 10*!!!!! See it!!! Many, many times!!!",Moulin Rouge!

It is a beautiful love story that is not a typical situation which makes it even better. The music is amazing and most of the songs people are familiar with which makes it even better. The costumes and makeup really set the tone and allow you to imagine what it would be like if you were attending a show at the Moulin Rouge. This film is very different from most musicals and i think that's what sets it apart. The biggest take away from this film is that it is very entertaining and you can watch it over and over again. Would deffinantly comment this movie to anyone!",Moulin Rouge!
1496,parrot99,Like two movies in one,4,28 October 2001,"The problem I had with Moulin Rouge is that it almost seems like Luhrmann shot two movies - one good, one bad - and had a blind person splice them together. The romance between McGregor and Kidman is very good, the chemistry is excellent. Their stuff works. What doesn't is the over the top musical numbers, especially the ""Like A Virgin"" number - oy, vey what was Baz thinking on that one? Cut about one-third of the musical numbers and the movie would rate around an 8.",Moulin Rouge!

This is quite possibly one of the most beautiful love stories I have come across, thus far in my career as a film student.  Don't listen one minute to the uptight ""professional"" critics who declare this piece is ""ruined"" because of the abrupt editing style it has adopted.  The music is phenomenal, and the acting is superb. If you haven't experienced Moulin Rouge yet, go...NOW!  And, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",Moulin Rouge!

1501,pothas,Love for Sale,9,18 June 2020,"Fresh to the scene, young writer, Christian played by Ewan McGregor arrives in 1899 Paris, France. Christian connects with the theater troupe and lands a job writing an extravagant musical play to be performed by the local artists and ladies of the evening. One of which is Satine played by Nicole Kidman. Christian falls in love with Satine - Satine is cautious because her business is to sell love, not fall in love. Enter The Duke, played by Richard Roxburgh, who will fund the theater endeavor. Aside from his investment, he wants Satine, who will be the star of the play, to become his lover. Satine goes along with the proposal for the sake of the play; however, she is not interested romantically in The Duke. Satine falls for Christian the writer, true love. Despite the fact, Christian doesn't have a penny to his name. The Duke becomes jealous, and mayhem is afoot. The audience is left wondering, will Satine go to The Duke or Christian. There's an element of dramatic irony as the audience knows that Satine's days are limited as she is inflicted with the consumption, otherwise known as tuberculosis. Satine remains on the fence as to reveal her true feelings. The Duke increases the stakes stating he will have Christian killed if she doesn't go along with the original agreement to be The Duke's lover. Satine agrees to stay with The Duke to protect Christian, leaving him confused and heartbroken. Christian's theater friends contribute to a jumble of events during the opening night of the play. After the dust settles, Satine is in Christian's arms.The theme of this film is that one cannot purchase true love. When a person pays for intimacy, there will always be doubt if it was given truthfully. If there is doubt, how can there be trust, and without trust, there is no love. To complicate matters, The Duke invests his own money to produce the musical play expecting more than ticket sales in return; I.E., Satine's affection. Hanging in the balance are the theater actors yearning for the show to go on. ¾ of the way into the film, Satine is told by Moulin Rouge's manager, Mr. Zidler played by Jim Broadbent that she is dying from consumption, otherwise known as tuberculosis.
Another film with a similar theme is entitled, Indecent Proposal produced in 1993. Indecent Proposal has the same theme in attempting to buy love for a million dollars. This film has a bit of a twist, in that the main character, Robert Redford, approaches a married couple asking the husband if he can have a one-night affair with the wife.There are a plethora of cinematic elements that unite the film. During the tango scene, theater spotlights were used on the dancers to create harsh illumination on their faces and crisp shadows. This heightens the tension between the characters and dilemma as to the outcome for who Satine will choose, The Duke or Christian. The musical number where Satine is lowered from the ceiling on a swing, upon which the camera circles around her quickly every 360 degrees, reveals the audience full of men, yearning for her attention. This accentuates the frenzy of the performance.Many books and films attempted portray the notion of buying love, hoping, thinking, wishing it would be successful. We see this presented across many genres and for a vast array of target audiences. One could say that this theme is universally appealing and intriguing. As an audience member, we're compelled to watch because we're hoping this would be the one time they solved this dilemma.",Moulin Rouge!

It has charm, magic, love, perfect directing and cutting... And the voice. Ewan McGregor is an emotional actor. He expresses emotions like no other actor before him. In ""Moulin Rouge"", he does it through singing! He expresses so much emotion in his singing, it shows how great an actor and a singer he is. Nicole Kidman is captivating, but easily draws second next to the charm, the voice and the talent that is Ewan McGregor. This story is not a movie. It is a dream.

What a feeling this movie generates, a visually spectacular (spectacular!) experience with a beautiful story line and a love to last the ages.  The use of modern day songs and lyrics kept the audience amused and at the edge of their seat to see what song they could recognise next.  And who knew that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could sing? These were the words whispered while filing out of the cinema by hundreds of movie goers through their now subsiding tears.  The whole cast surely surprised and mesmerised alot of people with their seemingly unlimited talent but none more-so than Nicole and Ewan.  This movie was beautiful in every way and I would strongly recommend it to all ages.  I loved this film and believe if the promotion of it is right it may become of Sound of Music notoriety.",Moulin Rouge!

Ewan Mcgregor can sing quite well, as can Nicole Kidman.  Fast editing, and a thumping soundtrack, keep you glued to the opening 10 minutes, getting you intrigued into this strange world that is before you.  The plot is simple and easy to follow, good fun, and very touching.In all if you liked Shakespeare in Love and Romeo and Juliet, you will love this. If you like classic modern songs, you will love this (see the old men singing Smells Like Teen Spirit).Great fun, go and see it, take a girl, she will love it too.",Moulin Rouge!

The unexpected 'Sound of Music' outburst by Ewan McGregor had the packed cinema bewildered at the beginning of the story, but the appearance of Kylie Minogue as the green shot fairy was entertaining and unexpected.  Nicole Kidman provided a suberb performance as Satine, with her wonderful rendition of 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' which was delivered with a deep yet beautiful voice. Moulin Rouge was a cross between 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Strictly Ballroom' with it's brightly coloured sets and wicked sense of humour.  This movie is definetly a must see!",Moulin Rouge!

This is a type of film that have to be experience.Some people might complain that the film is full of cliches and is overblown but that's the appeal of the film, it acknowledges how love sometimes become silly and trite and how we still celebrate it in spite or because of it. This film reaffirms that no matter how silly love is, no matter how we know it might hurt us, how cliched it is, we can't deny that we'd rather experience it.This film is beautifully made with great acting from Nicole, Ewan and all the other Supporting Casts especially Jim Broadbent. The editing is wonderful, the art direction, the costume, the songs, acting and the Directing deserve to be acknowledged come the Academy Awards.One of the best film I've ever had the pleasure to experience in my life, Moulin Rouge is a sure front runner for the Best Picture of the Year! (it would be a shame if its not acknowledge)My rate for MR, 11 out of 10",Moulin Rouge!
1511,Andramachy-1,"A ""Spectacular"" Show Business Done",10,3 June 2001,"I had total changed my mind about Nicole Kidman. She's not bounced any more between man-desired target, or just a blurred female character. McGregor has such a wonderful voice that he might referred him as  ""talented"". Watching this movie would be a wonderful experience if you are a fan of Broadway. Though the story has been displayed out in the first place, people would still rather pay for it for the dazzling costume, background design, and for the most of all, the love story. Due to the great performance of Jim Broadbent, and the way the camera moved, laughter filled the front part of this movie. Spectacular movie, spectacular recommended.",Moulin Rouge!
1512,taniane,Over produced and unmemorable - is Baz Luhrmann... Mel Brooks?,1,27 May 2001,"Baz Luhrmann's long awaited film Moulin Rouge has been unleashed - and what an unmemorable, over produced disappointment.The curtains opened and I waited for an innovative and spectacular movie experience. Presented instead with what might as well have been Mel Brooks meets 'The Sound of Music' (complete with table cloth 'Mother Mary style' on the fat man singing 'Like a Virgin').Jim Broadbent is excellently cast as Zidler (the owner of the Moulin Rouge). Satine (Nicole Kidman) as the head dancer/courtisan/actor gives her very best but ultimately her performance (and lip-synching) is lack lustre. Richard Roxburgh playing The Duke of Monroth is unbelievable having no authority or presence on the screen.If an unoriginal cheesy sound track with manic edits, motion sickness inducing cinematography and Mel Brooks style humor is your cup of tea, you'll love it.One star out of five.",Moulin Rouge!
1513,gary4ever,Not likely to be anything like this again,10,31 May 2001,"I'd just like to add my voice to the majority who loved this movie. Definitely the best movie I've seen in at least the last five years (and I go to the movies around 100 times a year).  I've seen the movie five times in five days and will probably wind up back at the Ziegfeld tonight.  Went with two friends last weekend and they HATED the movie.  But there you are. And though I see that most love this movie, I'd be interested in knowing if I'm the only idiot who's paying to see it again and again.  And here in NYC, it's $10 a pop!",Moulin Rouge!
1514,Fluffington Meadows,A series of skits incoherently jumbled together.,1,12 June 2001,"I am one of those people who is often sucked in by the hype surrounding a film and as such when it fails to live up to the publicity I can sometimes become very disappointed.Moulin Rouge, at least in Australia, was hyped to the hilt. Posters with declarations like ""This is a story about Love"", ""This is a story about Truth"" were around for months. The movie advertisements promised plenty with high octane editing, magnificent costumes and an overwhelming visual and aural energy. The publicity promised a story as sensual and passionate as the images and sounds the film contains. As such I went in with high expectations of something that would grab me by the throat and drag me into the seady, sexy, dirty, passionate world of the Moulin Rouge. I wanted to become involved, I wanted to see the pure, simple Christian become defiled and debased as he was seduced by Satanic Temptress Satine. I wanted unfair brutality thrown in the face of kindness, complexity into the face of simple ideals and to be burnt by dirty human characters not bored by the flaky caricateurs I see in this film.The storyline goes like this: Christian, poor writer from London comes to Montmartre Paris presumably to bathe himself in the (allegedly) bohemian atmosphere and lifestyle, the epicentre of which was located at the Moulin Rouge. At the Moulin Rouge he spots Satine, weird red headed woman and star of the Moulin Rouge show. Christian is smitten and in quick time (and thanks to an implausible ""twist of fate"") winds up meeting the courtesan. Within a few short minutes the two amorous beasts are ""in love"".But how could it ever be so simple? Christian can't have Satine without a bit of a custody battle ensuing between himself and the vaudevillian Duke of Worcester, and of course Satine coming down with a ""tragic"" case of tuberculosis. It all gets too irritating and too stupid. Humourless lines like ""You have to hurt him to save him"" are juxtaposed against (occasionally hilarious) covers like Madonna's Like a Virgin, which contrasts with the deadly serious Your Song, and the menacing Roxanne. All in all the film should probably leave most in the audience cold, but I doubt it will. More like a fireworks show set to music it can't be seen as a regular movie but more as a series of loosely connected skits, some of which work on their own, some of which don't, but taken all together they just don't fit properly. The performances apart from Nicole Kidman's are all pretty good, although there is little to no chance for real character development. Richard Roxburgh is probably the highlight with his comical exasperation one of the few emotions you can actually understand and identify with.",Moulin Rouge!
1515,tcardwell,brilliant,10,30 May 2001,"This movie was brilliant...and even better the 2nd time around.  It is truly what one goes to the movies for; to be transported to another time and place.  You hate to leave when it's over.  Please, please, marvel in it's excitement and love of movie-making.  I hope more directors have the courage to make movies that are out of the mainstream Hollywood standard.",Moulin Rouge!
1516,RALKSA,"A kaleidoscope of colour, movement and drama.",10,9 June 2001,I don't like musicals but I loved Moulin Rouge. How many movies do you walk out at the end wishing to see again? This is definitely one to see again (and again).Baz Luhrmann has created a film work of art that sets a new standard for others to strive for. It's not possible to take it all in in one sitting.  Like a perfect feast! Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are outstanding in their leading roles and Nicole has the beauty of a translucent pearl (Tom who?).See Moulin Rouge and weep for any love you ever had and lost.,Moulin Rouge!
1517,familybugs,the best movie ever,10,27 August 2006,"i loved the Moulin rouge it was sad but at the same time funny and Christian sung like an angel (sigh) i just loved it. I never new that Nicole Kidman could sing that well she was really good the songs went really well with her voice. I think she played the part really well especially at the beginning she made a really good ""sparkling diamond"". i thought that the duke did a really good job i found him quit scary at times. He had really good facial expressions. Christian had a really sweet sort of charm to him and made me feel sort of in way nervous for him but as soon as he started to sing that just slipped away. He gave me goose bumps every time he started singing especially the hills are alive with the sound of music line and the this is mine song. All up i thought it was a fun enjoyable film with a really good story line and the people playing the characters were chosen perfectly.",Moulin Rouge!
1518,Trubble05,A Unique Cinematic Experience,10,31 May 2001,"Baz Luhrmann has taken the formula of classic musicals from a bygone era and injected them with a HUGE shot of adrenalin (or absinthe) to bring us ""Moulin Rouge"". And what a cinematic experience! There's lots of color, noise and movement that is almost too much to take at times, and it will leave you gasping for breath. I could go on and on here, but I won't. My advice is just to go and see it and judge for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Baz and 20th Century Fox should now be negotiating ""Moulin Rouge 2"".",Moulin Rouge!
1519,cyrus_01,Incredible,10,1 June 2001,"I know this is probably one of those love it or hate it movies...but I'm just here to give my opinion. I thought it was one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. Everything about it just fit together perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone that has an open mind and is looking to be blown away...if not by the plot and dialogue, then at least by the set design and direction.",Moulin Rouge!
1520,afaaka,A Refreshing Burst of creativity,9,18 September 2007,"A story about truth, beauty, freedom, and love And loving it is hardly a challenging task when this magical story is displayed on the screen. Moulin Rouge throws a surprising twist on what seems to be an overused theme of ""love"" in Hollywood. Is it overused? Well, after watching this film, I found myself reconsidering the meaning of ""love"" as a cinematic theme and concluded that my previous definition was to be taken off the shelf; it is now well expired.It is a movie I entered with ambivalent to low expectations. For all I knew, I was in for another ride down the musical roller coaster, and this one was going to make me really sick (""oh no, here comes another long song about love, where's the barf bag?"") Instead, I was treated to one of the most phenomenal stories ever captured on film, told with such creativity and originality that I knew there had to something wrong with it. How am I so easily falling for this fantasy/comedy/musical/drama/documentary(wait, did I say documentary? Well yes, this was a fantastic narrative that was really told biographically, so in a ""let's-not-get-too-technical-about-film-terms"" sort of way, was a fictional documentary).And I thought I'd seen and heard it all just when I realized, ""wait, I did."" Most all of the songs performed were readapted famous singles already made famous by such artists as Elton John, Madonna, The Police, and Nirvana, yet I found every performance to be beyond delightful, entertaining, amusing, and most of all, inventive; these performances pieced together every mood of the story, collectively seducing me, and with no sense of time, I was in love with this movie.Moulin Rouge sets not only a standard for musicals but a standard for the entire film industry. When the next movie comes along with musical performances that seem to actually improve the original song, more than impressive booming vocal performances by the two leads, a story that carries the viewer a fantasy world that for once feels so real, I'll be the first person to buy the ticket. But wait, on second thought, I must keep in mind the old saying, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" This film deserves to be that single original gem, and should never be sought to be improved, recreated, or just copied in the form of another ""unoriginal film"", instead, this cinematic achievement should be set aside and just appreciated and glorified for all that it has accomplished.",Moulin Rouge!
1521,samuelc17,Visual Feast and master expression of deconstructionizm,8,2 June 2001,"A beautifully executed visual feast.Let me just say that this movie has no original pieces in the whole movie. However, the originality of the movie comes through in its unique and post-modern arrangement of the other people's creations without becoming overly cliché.The basic plot of the story is simple; boy meets a girl, boy falls in love with the girl, some conflict, and resolution.However, with its master cinematography and customs, this movie shines.I had two problems with the movie. The first 10 min of the movie is just too confusing and annoying. It can be seen as a techno. aspect of the movie, But I didn't like it.Secondly, to overcome awkwardness of musical, they used a lot of popular in-pop music. While this added to the humor and will appeal to teen-agers, little less pop-music and more original arrangement could have made this movie solid 10 for me.Overall, a great meal that satisfies your mind as well as your taste buds.",Moulin Rouge!
1522,jespero,Amazing...,9,2 June 2001,"When I started to watch this movie I got scared at the beginning. I was thinking ""oh no, not another stupid, bad made movie"" and I was about to just leave. But it got to me, grasping me harder and after a while I was sitting and enjoying a movie like I haven't done in a long time. This movie is extraordinary and I have only one word for it, ""Love"". I love it. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for music but this movie is combining both decent acting and a great variety of songs. If you like musicals then go and see this. It's one of the best movies out there for the moment.",Moulin Rouge!
1523,Vincent Moore,Marvellous postmodern pastiche and surprising singing skills.,10,2 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge was a joy to watch.  I had not seen any previews or advertisements for the film, but had seen the John Huston film of the same title about Henri de Tolouse-Latrec.  This film, while sharing the title, was not about Tolouse-Latrec, but about love and, more importantly, about the power of the narrative.  This postmodern pastiche of song lyrics and stunningly dynamic images reinforced the concept that our lives, emotions, and actions are all the story that we are constantly writing.  Some great symbolic actions, such as the character Chocolate catching Nicole Kidman's character twice, once literally and once figuratively, highlighted the idea that the lives of the characters were text.  Other uses of narrative as reality, songs used as dialogue for example, invested the film with wit and meaning.  Ewan McGregor's voice was surprisingly good and Nicole Kidman was no slouch in that department either.  The film also appeals to a wide range of age groups--for the same reasons, too.",Moulin Rouge!
1524,mlg1952,Contemporary music was pointless and why no Art?,8,2 June 2001,"There is a more than adequate repetoire of music from the turn of the century that would have been entertaining and appropriate to the storyline. The use of contemporary music was pointless and annoying.  However, other than this significant flaw, Moulin Rouge was an entertaining film.  It would have been nice to have some exposure to the wonderful art of the period by Toulouse-Lautrec as he was a significant character in the film.",Moulin Rouge!
1525,gremlinz42,The deciding factor,10,2 June 2001,In my humble opinion this movie will draw a line across the world. There will be two sides. People who love it and people who hate it. I loved it. Go see it right now!!! I did not see one flaw in the entire movie.,Moulin Rouge!
1526,nycnewyork,Great Movie,10,3 June 2001,"I went to this movie not knowing what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised.  In the beginning it seemed like the random complexity of a Fellini film. Once the story line developed, it really came across as a cleverly written musical parody of the past 2 decades of pop-culture music with a love story intertwined.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor both carried the parts they played well and with great aplomb.  What was really shocking was their voices.  Their screen presence as singers surprised me as I never really pictured either of them as a real vocal talent.Summary:  Good movie (even for the guys to see) and the special effects and cinematography were phenomenal.Trebor",Moulin Rouge!
1527,nala76,A waste of an evening,1,3 June 2001,"I was so incredibly disappointed.  This was truly a waste of both my time and money, and an insult to the glorious movie musicals of the past.  Not one original song--instead a long strain of every recycled old pop song you never want to hear again.  And the vocalists certainly did not help the matter.  Ewan McGregor, usually an excellent actor, suddenly loses all acting skills as soon as he opens his mouth to sing.  (As to his vocal abilities, he certainly leaves much to be desired.)  Kidman, though making a slightly better showing, was uninteresting and lacking in true vocal training, proving that it takes more than ""star power"" to have a vocal prowess that can carry a musical.  Definitely not Kidman's best work.  The story itself has potential, and the cinematography is unique and artistic...but the movie goes downhill from there.  This is a devastating mess of a movie.  If you're going to make a musical, for goodness sakes, PLEASE actually write an original musical score, and cast REAL SINGERS, not just ""big names."" Such a shame--done right, this movie could have been fantastic.",Moulin Rouge!
1528,adambonarek,Talk about a modern musical!,9,3 June 2001,"Congrats are due to Baz Luhrman for succeeding in creating a truly modern musical.  I was not sure what to expect going into this film, with so many reviews being very harsh of the fact that modern songs were used in a film that is set in 1899.  Yet, that is precisely what makes the film a ""modern"" version of the classic musical.  I can't wait to see it again!",Moulin Rouge!
1529,tcob,not very complementary,1,4 June 2001,"I don,t understand why they had to change camera shots so often, but I have seen strobe lights that are slower. Hopefully they didn't spend too much on costumes, as the camera changed so fast the eye could not focus on anything. After 25 minutes of this I started to time the camera changes ( just shows how it held my attention) At this time they changed on average of 2.3 seconds. The opening number was much faster, probably 100 different shots in 38 seconds. If they are nominated for anything it should be for the poor sap that had to splice all those tiny bits of film together.",Moulin Rouge!
1530,giuliana81,sensational,10,4 June 2001,"This movie has immediately gone into the list of my all time favorites, and I think of myself as pretty damn picky. First of all, how cool is Baz Luhrman, who has created such a daring, visionary work of ART. The stars, Nicole and Ewan prove themselves more than equal to the huge stylistic challenge that is given them in this movie. The visuals are stunning,as is the soundtrack (alright, I did get a little bit of motion sickness till I got used to the demands that were being placed on me as an audience member)...The supporting cast is sensational. Who is this guy Richard Roxburg? Where did he come from? I swear I was laughing so hard at his Duke I nearly peed my pants (a real high point for me was a duet of Like a Virgin with Roxburg and British actor Jim Broadbent). I also found the film deeply moving. I was a mess at the end of it. It's like, you make a decision during the film to either go with it or not. Well I went with this film like I haven't done in years. Brilliant, brave movie-making.",Moulin Rouge!
1531,permanent_daylight,See this movie in the theater so you can get the full effect.,7,4 June 2001,"The first half hour or so of this movie is completely amazing!!  My date and I both had huge idiotic grins on our faces- my cheeks actually started to hurt from smiling so much.  The fast pace of the movie, the jumpy camera work, and the vibrant colors were stunning.  I really enjoyed the fast dialogue, the clever musical numbers, and the way crazy characters would pop up from random places.  That being said, when the movie calmed down towards the end it lost most of its charm.  It went from being overpowering and engaging to sappy and predictable.  The finale was a letdown: not because of the tragic ending to the love story but because it lacked the intensity that the beginning of the movie led you to expect.",Moulin Rouge!
1532,tabethaf,Best movie I have seen in years...,10,5 June 2001,"This is a non-stop rollercoaster ride, the best movie I have seen in years. I will not give one second of the movie away, but I will say that this is a movie one can see a thousand times and each time will see something new. Sit back, relax and enjoy this musical and artistic extravaganza.",Moulin Rouge!
1533,kambei7,Wildest ride of the year,10,4 June 2001,"See this movie. Two hours of kinetic energy that transport you into a world of color, song and dance.  From the opening Twentieth Century Fox titles you know this is going to be a different kind of movie. It dares to clash and stand out and scream and go on and on and on, until you give in to the spectacle, and find yourself just one of the many patrons of the Moulin Rouge staring wide eyed and trying to catch your breath.  Run-ons abound, but that's the point. This film has no periods or commas, no gentle transitions.  It's about constant movement.Besides the glorious dizzy speed, Moulin Rouge is a well constructed and clever story, circling around a love triangle amidst a play that mirrors the events of the production as they unfold.  I was reminded of Tim Robbin's Cradle Will Rock, another great movie that used a production of a play, to reveal and test the convictions of characters.  Both films use art as a reflection of the artist, and the artist as a reflection of his art. Both explore the financial needs of a production giving way to its integrity. The difference between the two is, Cradle is more cerebral, Moulin is more emotional. Hyper-emotional.  Romantic.Moulin Rouge is about love, and what we are willing to sacrifice to keep that love. I loved this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1534,Parliamo,The best opera I've ever seen,10,4 June 2001,"One should always be suspicious of promises that something will be ""like nothing you've ever seen"", but Moulin Rouge is a breathtakingly original work of art.  As I watched it, I could not help thinking that this is what opera is all about.  Everything - the actors, the music, the costumes, the sets, the cinematography - contributes to the development and expression of the story.  The plot is indeed simple, but it is archetypal in its simplicity, and speaks volumes on the themes of the movie - truth, beauty, freedom, but most of all love.  I am reminded of opera because of Wagner's esthetic of trying to create Gesamtkunstwerke - complete works of art - and this movie goes much further toward that ideal than any opera I've ever seen.  Most of the musical numbers are a collage of songs and each snippet that is recognized evokes some distinct memory or emotion.  These are distilled packages of emotion that add to the sea of sensory stimulus that washes over you as the movie unfolds.  The director had a unique vision and surrounded himself with remarkable artists who seem to have been challenged to be at the height of their creativity.  I was stunned by this movie and wept as the last credit rolled by, not because of the sadness of the story, but because it was so beautiful.",Moulin Rouge!

I have seen this movie five times at the theater already, have the soundtrack and plan to buy the movie on DVD.  I recommend this to anyone who likes Musicals and comedies and romances.

A fabulous blend of music, song, cast, and story.",10,7 June 2001,I consider myself enough of a fan of mainstream cinema to know what makes a good movie.This is it.Baz Luhrmann and the cast and crew have combined to provide the ultimate musical presentation - you feel like you are actually watching a stage show as part of a theatre audience. The story and its telling are superb (if not new). From the first appearance of the curtain you become gripped by the emotions of the characters AND your own recollections of the various songs included in the magnificent soundtrack.I felt a wave of blissful goosebumps at several points as I was so moved by the performances of Nicole and Ewan (and Jacek Koman as well).Moulin Rouge is a reminder of the power of cinema.,Moulin Rouge!

Get over all the crap floating around about how it's cut too fast, it's too colorful, it's got too much music, it's trying to revive an out-dated movie form. Flooey. Sure, there's great camera tricks; unbelieveable production. Overkill, overkill, overkill on all your senses. But that's only to make the solid core - the real story - smack you all the harder when it's ready. God bless Baz, he understands love, and loss, and being human. Go see this movie. Go see it again.

1541,GaneshaX,20th century answer to the popular opera,10,22 June 2001,"I keep seeing occasional comments about this film where some under-educated, action film addicted, toxic, cultural cretin thinks this is the worst movie ever.  Ooooh...that just irritates me. Bless their pea-pickin' hearts, they just don't get it.Open your mind. Educate yourself.  I think this is a superior film.  I won't call it a musical.. it is more of the 20th century answer to the popular opera (as in popular drama) of the 18th & 19th centuries before Opera became the exclusive desmesne of the elite.  All my students will be writing essays about this film describing how early modern theatrical movements like Futurism, Dada, Symbolisme, Surrealism, Theatre of Cruelty, and Brecht are used and fused with 20th century popular culture enthythematic contructs to create a coherent and effective whole. I can't wait! Although, I'm sure they will groan. Too bad.I've seen it twice now and I found it even more thrilling the second time around.  The only thing I HATE is that the ""soundtrack"" is NOT a soundtrack at all.  Many songs are missing or in totally different forms than they are in the film.  Small background pieces are brought to the forefront and central pieces are left out altogether.  The sale of the soundtrack as a soundtrack is a fraud...it's still good but it's not a soundtrack!",Moulin Rouge!
1542,markresurreccion,This is a great piece of artistic work!,10,10 June 2001,"I fell in love with this movie the first time I watched it.  At first the movie felt weird and fast paced.  The catchy songs, beautiful dancing and costumes, and the specticals of the sets were amazing.  The love story of Satine and Christian is timeless and very moving.  I fell in love with Nicole Kidman's character and the way she portrayed Satine.  Both Ewan and Nicole have suprisingly beautiful and passionate voices that the first time I watched the musical, I doubted it was even them singing, like they were actors lip-singing to a pre-recorded tape.  McGregor's final scene with Nicole is the best I've seen him act.  His heart felt emotion he portrayed needs a 2002 Oscar nomination.  He's one of my favorite actors because of that very role.  Nicole Kidman is timeless herself and with this part as Satine under her belt, she'll only be ever more successful in her acting career.",Moulin Rouge!

While I don't think its for everyone this was by far the most fun I've had in a long time. If you're sick of cheesy Hollywood movies take a look at Moulin Rouge. It doesn't try to pretend that its reality but rather takes the art of storytelling to a whole new level, leaving you breathless as the credits roll.",Moulin Rouge!
1544,julie_arie,Lavish!,10,8 June 2001,"The movie was a lavish blend of acting, singing, and sets.The only warning: most of the fun to be had was identifying the numerous songs - and a vast amount are from the 1980s-1990s - so if you didn't listen to popular music then, you may not pick up on some of the references.",Moulin Rouge!

1549,crr82,Spectacular Spectacular,10,10 June 2001,"I don't think I've seen a movie that mixes vocal music, instrumental music, dance, and imagery so vibrantly and so successfully.  This movie is by far the most exciting musical I've ever seen or been in.  The way that the music and images are constantly moving you along as an audience member is unbelievable.  This movie has the potential to revolutionize the way Hollywood makes movies.  Everything meshes together so well, even the ""pop"" music, to create the most artistic picture I've seen.  This film shows how movie making can be the greatest art form of them all because it has the chance to combine all other previous forms of artistic expression.  Music, costumes, dances, elaborate sets, beautiful words, and great acting combine to produce a very fulfilling movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1550,tony_myhill,This film should down in history as the complete example of form over substance.,6,15 July 2002,"This film should down in history as the complete example of form over substance.   Although interesting to watch why someone wasted 4 years of his or her life on this film is a mystery.  Baz keeps on about the story when of cause there isn't one - I suppose if he says it often enough he'll convince himself that there was one.  One of his collaborators (or should that be partners in crime) said that the 'story' was decided by the songs that they could licence.Nicole Kidman looked just like Cyble Shepard from some musical she made in the 70's and the 'baddie' Richard Roxburgh was doing a Tim Brooke-Taylor impersonation (from the 'Goodies' and Willie Wonker) Jim Broadbent looked like the Gilbert character from Topsy-Turvy and the great McGregor just looked like he hadn't a clue why he had agreed to do the film.Upon saying that - the sets and costumes were great - but the cinematography... who can tell - as far as I could see there wasn't a shot longer than 20 seconds in a 2-hour film.  That is even worse than that Bruce Willis thing about the asteroid.  As for the F/x you can be the judge.  I've seen better on a pop video - in fact that's what is, a 2-hour pop video.",Moulin Rouge!

This is a sweet little nightmarish dream sequence from beginning to end.  The music, interwoven throughout without noticeable effort to chisel it into the plot, was beautifully done.  I was moved to tears by the performances (and this time it wasn't because the acting was terrible). I loved this movie.  It was purely flawless.",Moulin Rouge!

A little wild, weird and ""out there,"" but that's what movies are supposed to be, right?Go see the latest Titanic incarnation if it suits you (ahem, Pearl Harbor) or the latest Indiana Jones rip-offs if that's your thing (Mummy Returns and Tomb Raider) or maybe even the new, modernized version of E.T.

My 10 rating is for the pure entertainment value. I think I have seen all of the all time great movies. Moulin Rouge tops the list for entertainment value and that is worth something. It is a good job that my daughter has not seen this because it gives my brother and I a good excuse for a second viewing. And I am looking forward to that I can tell you.

Evita came close but just fell short of amazing.. Moulin Rouge never lets up with its zooming cinematography and combine this with the searing score and electric on screen chemistry between the two stars, the goose bumps never seem to stop! I think I'll be seeing this again and again and again.. Ewan was a bit of a surprise with his heartfelt performance of Elton's ""Your Song"" and Nicole shone with her previously unknown pipes.

Besides the music being absolutely amazing, not to mention by a certainly praiseworthy group of music artists, the whole of this film is no less then `spectacular, spectacular!' The selection of wild, exotic colors blended with the explosive charisma of an all star cast is perfect for one truly entertaining viewing. The cinematography is sheer genius, with some of the best transitions I have every seen, accompanied by some smooth, dazzling special effects. The captivating story line, a purely emotional voyage of dramatic standards, provides a sensation of amplified feeling only captured in those moments of true love. All of this combined with the radiant use of turn of the century clothing, set to the beat of modern generation's musical influences. With a superior cast, this group of inspiring performers outdo themselves again and again throughout the film. Also, I have to mention that the cast vocals are totally stunning! Even the soundtrack does justice to the essence of this movie. I'm sure you'll never expect what is ahead if you haven't seen this flick yet!!",Moulin Rouge!

The movie dances and sings in the hearts of all true romantics.",Moulin Rouge!
1559,riesjeroos,"Spectacular, spectacular!",10,7 October 2001,"I'm not too fond of musicals, I don't like soppy love stories with predictable endings and I am not a frequent visitor of posh brothels either. Still, I was simply dazzled by Moulin Rouge.The first fifteen minutes of the movie were very fast and flashy, almost music video-like. Some (middle aged) people right next to me in the cinema started shifting around their chairs uneasily, but I'm sure they got what they waited for after a short while anyway. I didn't mind the beginning at all, I thought it was a very clever way of portraying the chaotic and lively atmosphere in the famous nightclub.After the initial chaos died down a bit, the viewer got a tragic love story about the poor English writer Christian (McGregor) who falls in love with the posh dancer Satine (Kidman) in the famous Parisian nightclub Moulin Rouge. However, she has to be the lover of a very rich duke who pays for the production of Spectacular spectacular, the new Moulin Rouge show. This is a story about a poor sitar player who falls in love with a courtisane, but she has to marry the wealthy maharadja. The parallel is clear, I think. Satine and Christian start a secret affair, but the jealous duke gets suspicious and does anything to stop the passionate love affair between the two. The premiere of Spectacular spectacular is a tragic climax of the love story: will Satine choose for the duke's money, or follow her heart for the first time and leave Moulin Rouge together with Christian?It is not the story that makes Moulin Rouge such an interesting picture, it is in the incredible way it is told. Fabulous camera shots, interesting use of classic and modern pop songs (Madonna's Material girl and The Police's Roxanne will never be the same) and most of all, very good acting and singing of the two heroes, Kidman and McGregor. Never knew they could sing at all, so I was a bit sceptical about this aspect of the film beforehand. But I must admit I was quite impressed, particularly with McGregors efforts. Give 'em both and Oscar, and the person who cast Miss Minogue: give him two (for his guts).",Moulin Rouge!
1560,sail-aria,A Most Engaging Film,10,14 June 2001,"I found ""Moulin Rouge"" to be a most engaging and enjoyable film.  I think Baz Luhrmann is an incredibly gifted director, and he's assembled a top notch cast to inhabit this cutting-edge film. Ewan McGregor displays his finest acting ability to date (not to mention a superb singing quality), and Nicole Kidman has discovered new heights of acting not previously displayed.",Moulin Rouge!
1561,toby_s55,The most entertaining film I have ever experienced!,10,14 June 2001,"Never before have I been to a movie where I could just not stop smiling. This is certainly one of the greatest movies of the modern era. From the opening Fox studios intro to the gripping climax, the film transports you into to the colourful, exciting and magical world, know as the Moulin Rouge. i just want to go and see this film again and again and again. The use of modern music diced into the late 19th century era is done with sheer perfection and brillance. The mind of Baz Luhrmann is one that must astound anyone who has the pleasure to be associated with him. Ewan and Nicole are perfectly matched. It is certainly Nicole's greatest achievement as an actor. 10 out of 10!",Moulin Rouge!

Buy the soundtrack. The chemistry between Nicole and Ewan in this movie was stunning, and the scenery was unbelievable. The story starts off a little strange, and it's the kind of movie you have to watch twice to get a lot of the little details and innuendos that are hidden in the flashing camera angles and song lyrics. But after the first time you see it, you'll want to see it again and again. The beginning is a little tricky to get at first. You already know the ending before you even get to scene 2. But throughout the movie, you fall in love with all the characters, songs, and the storyline. It's the best love story of all time, and I urge you all to watch it. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll always be left wanting more.",Moulin Rouge!

Genius!! i also love Toulouse because he says 'The Sthparkerwing Dimondth' and 'The Childwen of the Wev-a-Woothon'!! and i think its a really good twist at the end when Satine dies!! but then Ewan is crying!! :( xx",Moulin Rouge!

The cast looked as embarrassed as I felt for them.God preserve us from Hollywood plundering the past; from unoriginality, from remakes and from travesties such as this! Bury it please in a deep hole.Unfortunately I was on a flight somewhere when this film was aired. I survived merely by the expedient of disconnecting the headphones.Anyone ever see the British TV sitcom ""Goodnight Sweetheart"" starring Nicholas Lyndhurst? Well - it was pretty much like that; 'modern' songs reused in an historical backdrop. It doesn't work. Ever. m No disrespect to Mr Lyndhurst and his writers: the plot of the TV series is somehow explicable and works - in a way. ""Moulin Rouge"" doesn't. Full stop. End of story.",Moulin Rouge!

It has everything that one could possibly want in a movie--action, romance, comedic interludes, and a wonderful soundtrack.  One of the best things about this film how is it filmed.  At times this can be over-powering but in a good way.  Some scenes are choppy to add depth and to give the film something different from the main-stream to the film.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman each to a very good job with the songs in this film and I was surprised with how excellent they actually sounded.  When Ewan first sings, ""Your Song,"" it's unexpected how wonderful his voice is.  This film is beautiful and everyone should give it a chance.  Don't let the negative comments that I've heard be the deciding factor as to whether you should see this movie or not. Give it a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Moulin Rouge!
1568,iknowkungfu,Terrific,10,18 June 2001,"Just saw it last night and loved it. The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman was great, and the story between their two characters was moving. I liked the balance between the drama of their story, the music, the crazy choreography, and the humor. Plus, very clever little touches that made me smile when I noticed them, but they didn't distract me from the main story. Great visuals, too. One of my favorite movies of all time.I think Baz Luhrmann is a very good, very brave and creative director. Moulin Rouge is a somewhat familiar story told in an original way. I walked away from the theater in a better mood than before I saw it, feeling fulfilled, I guess. In my opinion, this film is what filmmaking is all about!",Moulin Rouge!

Most of them are not worth the $10 it costs, when I can rent it in a few months for $1.99.  This movie I have seen twice, and I'm already looking for another day next week to go see it again!  It gave me chills. I listen to the soundtrack over and over again.  I call it ""Moulin Rouge Radio - all Moulin Rouge, all the time."" If this doesn't get nominated for at least several Academy Awards, it will be a travesty.  Note: This movie is not for everybody.  You have to like: a)Musicals, b)Ewan McGregor c)filmmaking, or any combination of the above. I don't think liking Nicole Kidman is enough, because that usually means guys, and they don't generally like musicals, but if you are on the verge of going...go!  There are some very funny sections (""Like a Virgin"" is hilarious!)  I do think a lot of people are mislead by the commercials and ads they are seeing, because I have heard of a lot of people walking out after the first 15 minutes.  Again, it's not for everybody.

A very good and exciting film.,Moulin Rouge!
1571,attackemu,"Brilliant use of romance, absurdist and music",10,22 June 2001,"Moulin Rouge was a fantastic film that brilliantly used music from artists like Nirvana, U2, Elton John and The Police. The songs were incredible, the set(typical of Luhrmann's shows) was an over-the-top spectacular show and the acting was first-class. Nicole Kidman gave probably the weakest performace of the cast and she was excellent. Ewan McGregor gave arguably the best performance of his short career, and the entire cast brought in a remarkably powerful performance. If you like romance, drama, absurdist comedy or popular music, this is the film for you!",Moulin Rouge!
1572,goyvette,One of the greatest movies I've ever seen,10,25 June 2001,"Today was the seventh time I wenna see this movie and enjoyed it as ever. It's hard to say something about this movie to those who haven't seen it yet. I am sure that only those who's seen this movie can share this feeling. So beautiful, unique, and powerful. Also it has so many things to offer that I found something new in each time I viewed. Ewan and Nicole's first meeting scene with his singing(who's ever imagined that he could be so sweet and cute?), Elephant Love Medley(so clever and dreamy sweet, and as someone said already, it sounds like they were made just for this movie.), and their love secret song ""Come What May""...are all unforgettable. There are also so many witty comedies including the ""so exciting, so delighting"" scene introducing the story to make the duke invest, and ""Like a virgin"" scene, and much more. If you've seen this movie already, try to see it again and you'll be moved in another ways. If not seen yet, you don't wanna miss it out. Because it's a musical, it's much better to experience it in the cinema rather than at home with a small TV screen and speaker. I also definitely recommend the sound track that is just as excellent.",Moulin Rouge!
1573,krichards,One of 2001's Best,9,25 June 2001,"Here is a film that is not only visually appealing, but may bring back the musical genre. The interesting aspect of Moulin Rouge is that either, one does not like the film or one does. There seems to be very little middle ground. That ability to draw out emotion, to create talk days, weeks after the viewing is wonderful. Nobody will be talking about Tomb Raider three weeks from now, but Moulin Rouge, well, this baby has legs. Another interesting aspect of this film is that while other successful and entertaining films, Shrek for instance, was created to appeal to a wide audience, thereby not asking for the patrons to involve themselves with the story as it will be laid out for them, Moulin Rouge asks, no demands, that you get involved. If you fail to get involved then you will fail to understand the beauty of two people in love. That it is not all visual, but also psychological, tactile, and dare I even say olfactoral. Then again to understand the film, maybe Christen (McGregor)was right, you had to have been in love to understand love. And I do mean true love. Not the shallow kind of love many are in today. BTW I have nothing but admiration for the use of the songs portrayed. I love the idea that songs we all listened to, reflected on, and talked about as a culture was reflected in the story. I believe their use just allows us the ability to understand the story and charactors better. As Toulouse Lautrec once said (to paraphrase), I love the Moulin Rouge, because its ugliness is so beautiful. Check out his art as it brilliantly captures the time.",Moulin Rouge!

1575,yolanrf,Awesome!,10,2 November 2006,"This film has enchanted me. It shows how is the society in that hard period of the history in the suburbs of Paris. The power of the money can't buy love, but it can but the death :( I think the ending of the film is perfect, just what I think it's the best final. It would have been unreal if Satine had survived. I love the part when Christian do what she ask him for doing it: Tell their story. I also love the songs, they are famous songs mixed with new rhythms and voices. And they fix perfectly with the plot of the film. In my view, every teenager(and adult) has to watch it, it teaches a lot about love, truth and the society.",Moulin Rouge!
1576,The ClayMan,Best Picture? Yes.,10,29 June 2001,"This film has totally revitalised the movie musical, but without subscumbing to cliche's and still remaining original. Songs are tight, camera is brilliant, acting is right on par. If my guesses are right it SHOULD come out of next year with a swag of Oscars, and just as many nominations.I think John Liguizeamo (sp?) as Toulouse, Jim Broadbent as Zidler and Richard Roxybourgh (sp?) as The Duke, will all come out with an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and the winner will probably be Toulouse.The score will win. The camera and editing should win. And it SHOULD get Best Picture, making it the first musical to win the award since God Know's When. Absoloutley a must see for anyone, even if you hate musicals, you'll LOVE Moulin Rouge.",Moulin Rouge!
1577,skyler58,Spectacular! Spectacular! A unique masterpiece to be seen again and again!,10,29 June 2001,"I have now seen Moulin Rouge more times than I should say and I have noticed something new and unique every time.  This film is so intricate (and beautiful) that you cannot possibly absorb it all in one  viewing.  Luhrman (along with his Bazmark production team) really is a visionary and his films push the limits in such amazing ways.  The music, the sets, the choreography - all of it is awe-inspiring.  Ewan McGregor proves his versatility as an actor yet again by bringing such a heartfelt innocence to Christian - and  the man can sing!  Nicole Kidman went from being just another actress to me to one of my favorites - she takes on the role of Satine so honestly and proves that she not only has a comedic side but a great voice as well.  Together the two of them light up the screen.  In a year of mostly mediocre films (with a few notable exceptions) Moulin Rouge is totally refreshing.  It not only promotes truth, beauty, freedom, and love but is a perfect example of them as well.  Luhrman himself said that it was time for a new kind of storytelling and he was right!  Open your mind and enjoy one of the most original movie experiences in years.  A bohemian storm is brewing!",Moulin Rouge!

Even if you are not a 'musical' person you should still give this a try. The first ten munites are a turn off for some...but hang in there. Don't let this turn you. It does not set the tone for the movie as a whole. Give this one a shot. You'll like it.,Moulin Rouge!

Turns out I disliked it more the second time.People ask me if it's because it's not my kind of movie. I do prefer certain types of movies (american beauty, america psycho, fight club... that kind.)but I can watch any kind. I just tend to like drama/thriller.
Moulin Rouge is a drama?! How? The only dramatic sequence I can remember is when the narcoleptic is singing Roxanne which is also the same scene when Satine is at dinner with the Duke. That's the only drama. That was one of my favorite scenes... Along when they're singing/explaining to the Duke what the play, Spectacular Spectacular is about... Cute, fun, bouncy scene.The plot was WEAK. Boy meets girl, the two fall in love... This is a problem, though, because the girl just happens to be unwillingly attached to someone else. How many times has this been done? With a slight different twist? It's BORING.There were NO likable characters besides Christian. Odd for me, because I tend to like the 'bad guys' and the 'villains'. Christian was the complete opposite. He was innocent. He was sweet. And McGregor can SING. I've never seen any of his movies besides this. He put on a great performance in this ho-hum movie. I will definitely be checking out some of his other work.All in all, this movie was below mediocre. 2/10",Moulin Rouge!

If you want to see what a musical should be, check out TCM and start up the microwave popcorn.

It is beautiful, truthful, entertaining, moving, funny, sad, and ultimately very fulfilling.

Despite what people have said i think they did a great job and they can both sing very well, Ewan has a great voice, as does Nicole I encourage anyone to go see it, the kids would love all the colour and dancing, and the adults would enjoy the sad love story and the older songs redone by all the actors.

1587,i_am_my_own_girl,"Perfectly unique, Brilliantly original",10,13 July 2001,"Moulin Rouge, was, as mentioned in one of the other comments, the foundation of story's, plots, and themes today. 'Love' being the entire theme of the film, to call the film 'A new Idea' you would definatley have to go back in time, to before the world...With that in mind, it was the most enjoyable and fantastically, well-put film I've seen in an extremely long time (Never!!!)...
The extremely simple theme of love, gave Luhrman the ability to play, match, and create a fantastical story of - guess - LOVE, but not only this. Early in the film, the statement ""This is a story about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all LOVE."" The love, passion, anxiety, jealousy, and finally truth in the film was put wonderfully into a fast moving, high pitched, musical!!!The soundtrack... What can I say???... Superb!!!... The use of old time songs, both in the film, and the soundtrack, was 'mastermind'!!! Generally, with a musical or slightly musical theme, the soundtrack doesn't reflect the movie what-so-ever... This sountrack, brings the story right into the music. Each song is a reflection of a scene, or theme in the film and therefore, cannot be compared with any other...After the huge fuss of movies like 'Titanic', Moulin Rouge is absolutely under-estimated. The critics were hard on the film, due to Kidman's recent break-up, and the pressure put on her to perform brilliantly. Thankfully!,those who did go and see it are always happily surprised...BUT! - a large amount of people have found that you have to see the movie at least twice, due to the flash-backs, and fast-moving plot, and for those less used to it, or those who don't really fancy it, the second time is vital...You cannot comment on the Moulin Rouge without having seen it twice - unless you are used to fast moving plots and can easily understand them...Without seeing this movie, I don't think anyone can be allowed to have a 'favourite movie'...This is DEFINATELY the best movie in the world... See it, or be deprived...Enjoy... from ash...10/10!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1588,rdavidso,Frank-N-Furter meets Groucho meets Pee Wee Herman,4,15 July 2001,"I left the theater feeling like I had seen The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Pee Wee's Playhouse, the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup, and MTV -- all at once. Needless to say, such an amalgam was sometimes disconcerting. In fact, that combination was too much for the film to carry; it often failed to come together.References to songs of different eras seemed silly at first but grew on me as the movie progressed.  (One must ignore dozens of anachronisms if one is, as I was, determined to get some pleasure from the film.)  Despite some fine special effects, the first twenty minutes somehow manages to be the most boring.  And, some dialogue was laugh-out-loud ridiculous.  What kind of lyric is ""even though my make-up's flaking...""?I found the ""Roxanne"" scene the most compelling because it worked narratively, musically and visually.While the film would lose something on a smaller screen, I don't think it's worth the full price of admission.",Moulin Rouge!
1589,JillyLTJ,The most beautiful love story you'll ever see!,10,14 July 2001,So few movies today are able to evoke every emotion in just one sitting. Moulin Rouge goes above and beyond. It starts out crazy then turns into this beautiful love story. I've already seen it twice and the soundtrack never leaves my player. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have the most beautiful voices!!! GO SEE IT!!!,Moulin Rouge!
1590,Kristin1085,This was the best movie I've ever seen!!,10,15 July 2001,"OMG!! This is the best movie that I have ever seen and if you haven't seen it yet then I suggest that you get off your butt and go see it now!!! It has a little something for everyone. There's drama, music, romance, a little bitta action and totally hot characters. They couldn't have done a more perfect job with the casting- and who knew a hottie like Ewan Mcgregor could sing like that!! I won't say any more but if you haven't seen it you MUST SEE IT!! It'll keep you coming back again and again.",Moulin Rouge!

1592,im_canadian,The Best Movie Ever Made,10,17 November 2001,"Well, I don't know where to begin, besides saying that I have never felt so powerfully about any movie besides Moulin Rouge.  There was nothing wrong with this film.  The music, the design, EWAN!....EVERYTHING!  I have seen it four times and once it is released on DVD it is going to be added to my DVD collection.  I think everyone should watch Moulin Rouge at least once.",Moulin Rouge!
1593,Bazisagenious,The Bohemian Masterpiece,10,20 July 2001,"All movies have a message right? At least, they are supposed to. If one came and asked you what the message from Moulin Rouge was, you would know even if you hated the film. It was typed out for you right at the beginning. Ever seen a movie do that?The Moulin Rouge sets the stage for an immaculate story to take place, and also encompasses the history of France, and the Bohemian culture. Special effects aside, we can learn a lot from this film. Definitely, this film set the standard for musicals of the future. Although I can't imagine why anybody would resist its divine pull, if after the first half-hour you aren't hypnotized by the spectacle, go ahead and leave. You aren't ready to see it yet.Baz Luhrmann's fall-out-of-your-seat wonderful film takes apart the French Can-Can movies of the '50s and reimagines them for a new century. With jaw-dropping set designs, computer legerdemain and a soaring soundtrack of orchestrally reconfigured pop standards, the film brilliantly bridges a hundred years of cabaret, vaudeville, India's ""Bollywood"" extravaganzas and MTV. Who would imagine that a movie with such a rich story and no explosions or cars could have super-charged effects. Mr. Luhrmann wouldn't settle for less.Truly, Baz Luhrmann is a genious, and that is why i made my name- just for this review. And all you who think this movie is a waste of time: I'm sorry you don't appreciate art, and know that you should broaden your horizons before slamming something you don't understand. The movie wasn't written for you anyway. It was written for those who DO believe in true love.-Mark-",Moulin Rouge!
1594,dorkart,Awful insanity.,1,15 April 2002,"(warning: possible spoilers ahead)How can a movie that has a cliche plot, undeveloped characters, cheesy settings, overdone costumes, and no shots that last longer than 3 seconds get voted to be such a great movie?  I have no idea.  I barely sat through the movie and finished watching it only due to a crazy new year's resolution.  It actually hurts to watch it.  What most describe as ""a beautiful mix of color and music"" is really, well, not.  The closest thing I can compare it to is mixing beautiful colors of paint until they turn into ugly greyish-brown color that may remind some of waste and excretions. The only reason I'm writing about Moulin Rouge! is because I hated it so much and actually, I'm disgusted with myself to even write anything more. Please don't see this movie - it has no value as a piece of art whatsoever.",Moulin Rouge!
1595,FridayYet,Awful...horrible....couldn't be worse!,1,3 August 2001,"This may well be the worst movie I've EVER seen.  I'm very happy I only spent $4 for a matinee showing.  I can't imagine what the director was thinking.  Even if you were to buy into the fact that musicals don't need plots, the music was terrible too!  Don't waste your time or your money on this one!",Moulin Rouge!
1596,alieh137,J'adore le film!!,10,10 November 2001,I LOVED this movie to death!!  I saw it eight times in the movie theater and I know every line.  I just can't get enough of the excellent song and dance numbers.  Seeing Ewan McGregor dance around on his knees and get so very involved with his work is absolutely delighting.  I loved it all!!  I would definitely recommend it to everyone although I must say that those who don't like musicals tend not to like this movie.  But it is definitely a movie that should be marked in film-history.,Moulin Rouge!
1597,stuart_spam,One cliche after another,2,9 August 2001,The plot isn't original.  The songs aren't original.  The attempt at making the viewer dizzy by changing scenes quickly makes the movie feel like an two hour advert for itself.This movie reminded me of one of those sappy cheap lip-sync song and dance acts that amusement parks provide to parents who don't want to accompany their children on rides.This is one of two movies that I walked out on in my life.  Life's too short to be spent watching movies like this one.,Moulin Rouge!
1598,adrian007,A cinematic triumph!,10,10 August 2001,"Moulin Rouge is the kind of film that makes you aware of the true possibilities of modern cinema. From beginning to end, this film is an amazing aural and visual feast. It defies cinematic convention, and instead delivers one of the most inspiring pieces of entertainment that I've seen in a very long time. It grabs a hold of your spirit and takes it on one of the wildest rides around. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Macgregor literally light up the screen, and they can really sing! The use of contemporary music in a musical period piece is brilliant! The cinematography is amazing, and the visual effects are captivating. At the heart of this artistic masterpiece is simply a tale of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all love. And boy is it fun! Kudos to Baz Luhrmann! For the first time in a long time, I left the movie theater with the feeling that someone had actually made some effort to challenge my senses! Warning: If you've become accustomed to the regurgitated rubbish that hollywood has been putting out lately, you might be put off by Moulin Rouge's ORIGINALITY! On the other hand, if you're feelingadventurous, take a chance on Moulin Rouge. It's different, but that's a good thing.",Moulin Rouge!
1599,A_l_e_x_a,amazing!,10,22 October 2007,"I think i have seen this movie more then any other movie. It is just so touching and it could really be a true story about a girl like that. Honestly whenever I think about this movie, it makes me so happy! The storyline is great and has a great background. The music is one of the best soundtracks...ever. I love the music more than any other song. Especially ""Come What May"" and plenty plenty more! SO I'm just trying to say is this movie was great! There might be some parts in the movie where it is a little wild,crude, but that is just at the beginning so I wouldn't worry about it to much OK? And one more thing about this movie, it is so worth seeing! So go out and see it! It will change you, like what it did to me! In a good way..",Moulin Rouge!
1600,kpearson-1,Excellent!!,10,14 August 2001,"Loved it from start to finish.  Breathtakingly original, stunningly beautiful.  Can't wait to see it again to catch the bits I missed..... I want to see the actors who I didn't recognise the first time around. Everyone was superb.",Moulin Rouge!
1601,burma,Moulin Rouge is a modern masterpiece,10,19 August 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a cinematic marvel of modern editing techniques and classic Movie Musical flair. Combining the pageantry and wonder of the movie musicals of the 40's and 50's with the digital effects of today, Moulin Rouge manages a visual masterpiece that can only be described as tasty eye candy. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are surprisingly good in their vocals, lifting common pop songs from the past couple of decades to an elevated Musical Score format. The film plays at a quick pace that may be difficult for the older viewing audience to grasp, but is definitely in line with what today's younger audience comes to expect from combined music and video. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who likes creativity and love stories.",Moulin Rouge!
1602,gfarnell,Abysmal,1,10 September 2001,"Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life, strip away the incessant hideously garish performance (I'm sorry, but some fat guy dancing around singing a butchered version of Madonna's ""Like a virgin"" does absolutely nothing for me) and there is no film!There is only one good thing I can say about Moulin Rouge and that is that Ewan McGregor has a great voice, which unfortunately does nothing to rescue the plight of this film.It amazes me that so many people are saying this is a great film. At my local cinema, as soon the story indicated that the film was finishing over half of the cinema were already leaving the theatre, myself included! The only reason I didn't walk out earlier is because I would have resented paying money for not watching a film and now I can tell other people not to bother!",Moulin Rouge!
1603,greenfairy,"An ""unbiased"" opinion",10,26 August 2001,"I am obsessed with this film.  I cannot stop thinking about it, singing the music, dreaming about it. When I saw the movie for the first time, I said that I would not go back to see it again because it was TOO much!  Too depressing, too agitating, too visually stimulating, too cacophonous!  But, that I might return to see it just to hear music.  I have seen the film a total of 13 times before it left Hawaii and I would continue to see it if it were still playing here. The story is beautiful.  The writers have done a wonderful job. I cannot imagine any other director doing this movie in any other way than how Baz directed it.  Nicole and Ewan are magical.  I cannot praise Ewan's singing abilities enough.  He has such a beautiful voice! This is truly a ""Spectacular Spectacular""!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1604,handcheese,"drivel set to music. love, truth, beauty, blah.",2,30 August 2001,"i hated this movie.  cliched, sentimental drivel.  bad music, with the exception of the use of madonna's ""like a virgin,"" bowie's ""heroes"" and elton john's ""your song"", which was unfortunately ruined by it's incessant use in the film.  the music for luhrmann's ""romeo and juliet"" was infinitely superior.ewan macgregor tries his best, but can't save the overly sentimental pap of the script.however, i was impressed by the scene in which zidler sings ""like a virgin"" to the duke. i found the gender-reversal of this scene to be original and entertaining, in stark contrast to the remainder of the film.",Moulin Rouge!
1605,kat_in_blue,This is my favourite movie...,10,25 December 2002,"I really think ""Moulin Rouge!"" should have won the Oscar for the Best Movie in 2001, and perhaps Nicole Kidman could have won the Oscar for the Best Actress, but I'm not so sure of that. ""Moulin Rouge!"" is that kind of movie that you only see once in a lifetime. Jim Broadbent himself says that no one he knows has ever done a movie like this one. ""Moulin Rouge!"" is a movie, it's true, but it's a SHOW. Completely... Delicious to the eyes, to the ears and to the heart. The music is amazingly touching. As Ewan McGregor says, some of the lines are just to simple to be spoke, they have to be sung, and they turn into something beautiful. The voices of the actors are very good, and adjusted to their personality. All the colour in the costumes and scenaries, turn this movie into a masterpiece. Baz Luhrmann did an amazing job, he achieved something that no other director had ever achieved: Turn a movie into a small little sweet chocolate, that totally praises your heart, and everytime you eat it, you discover something new.Congratulations! =)",Moulin Rouge!
1606,tcipcic,This film made me feel like a child..,10,23 April 2002,"When I took this film in local videostore, I didn't expect it to wake the child in me. It took me in a whirlwind of emotions, from happiness to sadness, from wonder to amazement.. I like to compare these feelings with the time I watched 'Hair' for the first time. A breathtaking experience. I didn't sleep till 8 am 'cause I wanted to see the other DVD ( special features, etc. ) immediately after seeing the film. For me it is certainly one of the best films ever.",Moulin Rouge!
1607,m_beanland,Luhrmann's greatest triumph,10,2 September 2001,"This film is absolutely spectacular!! Such witty humour and gut wrenching sorrow has never beheld our screens, until MOULIN ROUGE! The most fantastic film of our time! I went to see the press release of this film on a whim, never in my wildest dreams did I expect a display of such splendour. The film was both moving and wonderful I cried through the credits and all the way home (a good few miles from Leicester square). Ewan McGregor's voice was superb and Nicole Kidman just shone!Baz Luhrmann, You are the master! What a success!",Moulin Rouge!
1608,rogeriobr,Just great!,10,3 September 2001,"I really enjoyed watching Moulin Rouge! and I'm not even into musicals. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's performances make it worthwhile; I was a great fan of theirs already, but had no idea they could also sing (and so well). The whole film, costumes, dance, jokes, etc., is excellent, and it's so good to watch a movie which doesn't evolve around just car chases, big explosions, martial arts fights, etc. (which seem so common nowadays). The only downside to me was that, although I can understand English quite well, I could hardly understand the actors' lines during the big dance scenes, so had to read the subtitles and miss a little of the (outstanding) visual production. The choice of songs was brilliant, felt really good hearing ""your song"", ""show must go on"", ""up where we belong"", etc... Definitely, a must!",Moulin Rouge!
1609,IXTSA,"overblown, overlong, over and out",3,5 September 2001,what a terrible movie - badly acted (with the notable exemption of Ewen McGregor who was the only good thing about the movie). I believe the movie relied too much on being clever and surreal rather than relying on what were interesting locales and an interesting story that didn't require so much razzle dazzle - extremely disappointing and overrated movie,Moulin Rouge!
1610,flako,What a bad movie....,1,13 September 2001,"The movie is too loud, the actors are bad, the songs are horrible....the movie is a horrible nightmare. It was one of the worst movie I've seen in the last couple of years. Don't waste your money for that movie.",Moulin Rouge!

1613,uri_2983,Overview - Dumas,10,31 December 2006,"This movie is excellent. I first watched it at my girlfriend's house, and liked it very much. However, one thing became very clear to me. This story is based either on Alexandre Dumas's play ""La dame aux camelias"" or the subsequent Verdi opera ""La traviata"". Despite the apparent thoroughness of the story, it is a wonderful representation of the play, I found no mention of the inspiration therein, or even its author, in the credits. Perhaps someone can clue me in. Am I missing something, or did the producers here fail to recognize that Dumas deserves credit? If anyone is wondering how I know this, it is through extensive study of the afore-mentioned Verdi opera, La traviata. In Moulin Rouge, I have even found similarities between the lines in the screenplay and Francesco Maria Piave's libretto written for Verdi's opera. Intrigued, I purchased a copy of La dame aux camelias and read through the text, and watched Moulin Rouge. There were so many similarities there that it was astounding! Seeing as the producers of this film (to whom I am eternally indebted for a wonderful movie and even more wonderful memories) failed to give credit to Dumas, Piave, Verdi, or even the character about which Dumas wrote his play (based on real life!) Alphonsine Plessis, or Marie DuPlessis, it should most definitely be noted that as wonderful as the movie is, it is something of a fraud. Well, perhaps that's a bit severe, but at the very least, I think they should submit something, somewhere, saying that they had neglected to give credit to Piave or Dumas, seeing as they took lines from both of them! Just a thought.",Moulin Rouge!
1614,evereth,"A wildly energetic, fantastically filmed musical extravagance",10,22 September 2001,"Having had no idea what to expect, I was fascinated and stunned by this film. It's billed as a musical romance, I think, but that's like billing ""Star Wars"" as a space adventure - it just doesn't describe it.There will be some who don't like ""Moulin Rouge!"". Much like there were some who didn't rate ""Toy Story"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" when they first came out. Go with an open mind and you will love this film.The only thing that didn't work for me was the story, because there was nothing new in it. But you don't go to this film for the story.Mere words can't capture the spectacle of ""Moulin Rouge!"". A picture paints a thousand words, but this picture needs 10,000 to give it adequate description. Suffice to say: expect wild music, amazing choreography, stunning camera work, superb costumes, incredible sets, wondeful post-production work ... and you'll still be over-awed by the complete effect.",Moulin Rouge!
1615,danielcraig,Incredible!,10,26 September 2001,"Um.. wow. When I first watched it on a big screen with larger than life sound, I was slightly turned off at parts. Maybe I couldn't take in all the information and process it in such a short time that the director allowed. Maybe I was trying to apply past experiences to this new one, and failing. By the end of the movie I was going over what I had just seen and I was stunned. Stunned by the skill of the director. How does one, or many for that matter, orchestrate such a magnificent scene, such as Christian's first night at the Moulin Rouge? Then how does one string hundreds of similar scenes together to form such a `Spectacular Spectacular' Movie?I keep going back to the first bedroom scene where Satine and Christian fall in love and think to myself. Oh my god, I really like that Elton John song. I must have replayed that scene a hundred times by now. For this scene alone it is worth buying this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1616,crazy_claire94,Cry if you want,10,7 January 2007,This movie by all is the best I'm in love with this movie!! it portrays love in many ways helping people to understand it even if their not romantic Nicole and Ewan portrayed their characters brilliantly With their own voices combined it makes it more original. Even if their not amazing pop singers they both can sing like! The characters Satine and Christian are just amazing the pain that was shown in the first few minutes was sad!! but as it lifted into the comical scenes u were lifted and moved with it!! i cant write much more i just am speechless by this movie it is my favourite of all time partially of the actors and actresses and the original song Come What May which is amazing and beautiful lyrics and music. ten out of ten i know the script off by heart i swear!! plz just watch people if u love amazing movies and want love!!!,Moulin Rouge!
1617,Satlos,Impossible to resist!,9,25 October 2001,"Last night, I saw Moulin Rouge! for the second time since it began its theatrical run. My girlfriend and I were pretty much alone in an old, delapidated, small-town movie theatre--you could hear the speakers annoyingly hissing with age during the previews. Suffice it to say that I was not expecting my second viewing of the film to be as powerful as the first. I found that the opening bit of craziness at the Moulin Rouge (with Zigler screaming, etc..) was a bit grating. Yet, once Ewan and Nicole start singing to each other, the movie grabs ahold of you and doesn't let go. These people seem to be so in love, it's incredible. I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can be won over again and again by these two actors' brilliant performances.",Moulin Rouge!

1619,Allison Murphy,Paradox: Cheesy but tasteful,4,7 October 2001,"This movie was La Boheme - with a serious twist.  I thought the parallelisms were sweet.  I loved the tome and atmosphere of the movie.  The stage came alive and you felt like you were there.  And just as the Moulin Rouge played popular music of the day.  So did this.  The scenery took you back to a place you'd never been and the music was intended to make you feel as if this was your Moulin Rouge.  As if then were now and vice versa.  T.S. Eliot's ""objective correlative"" if you will.  The problem is that I felt thrown off by the medley of popular love songs.  It felt out of place, out of time and out of character to me instead of drawing me in - which I believe was it's intended purpose.  Still I have a good deal of professional respect for the gutsy decision to take that chance.  The movie itself is full of lively vibrant characters and the scenery and costumes  are gaudy to the point of storybookish.  Worth seeing, if only for the sake of interest.",Moulin Rouge!
1620,Catmunk22,What a Fabulous Movie!!!,10,8 October 2001,"This is the best movie that I have ever seen. After seeing it the first time, I thought it was very good. Then some other friends wanted to see it, so I decided to go see it a second time. It was amazing! I ended up seeing it 3 times the first week, and I have seen it 11 times now in the theatre. It is the most visually beautiful movie that I have ever seen, and the more you see it the more you love it. So for everyone who saw it once and didn't really like it or you are just indifferent. Rent it when it comes out on video. I guarantee that seeing it again will make it a movie that you can't get enough of. This is the best movie ever made, great acting, great singing, great movie. If you have seen it, see it again; if you haven't seen it, SEE IT!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1621,bildblau,wonderful film,10,8 October 2001,"When I visited the cinema, I was surprised this film is a musical. But the actors are all great and the ones who sings have marvelous voices, the music and the pictures were combined harmonically together. The story wasn't new, but with the new versions of the known songs the film get this special kick. I think it is a 'must see' for those ones, who love music and won't be afraid of a musical.",Moulin Rouge!
1622,finsanity,"Trite, horribly cliche, and couldn't even have ori...",2,8 October 2001,"Trite, horribly cliche, and couldn't even have original music for being a musical!  The entire movie is so over the top cheesy and two dimensional. The characters are made out of cardboard and never grow.  The message of the movie just keeps hitting you on the head over and over again in the same manner.  I can't believe everyone likes this movie so much.  My girlfriend and I moaned through the whole thing and almost walked out for fear of yacking.  I usually like musicals and am tolerant of cheese in a movie, but this one is just pure special effects fluff.  There is not even any good dancing, just short clips of a couple of moves that are strung together. But, I guess I'm glad that you all like it so much.",Moulin Rouge!

It's original,I haven't seen anything quite like it,it's colourful, the costumes are amazing and i don't think the castors could have found anyone more perfect to play the parts of Satine and Christian. Also, the quality of acting coming from the other actors was breathtaking. The first time I went to see Moulin Rouge,I missed the  first twenty minutes of it.My close friend had been to see it before me and told me i'd missed the best part.Nicole Kidman coming down through the ceiling on a trapeze.Nicole Kidman being my favourite actress since forever,I went to see it again five times.

I will always remember this movie as a movie that is different from others. A lot of songs and scenes that you cant compare to other movies.The humor in this movie is great , the famous songs of madonna for example are well integrated in this movie.Ethan Hawke plays his part very well , although Nicole Kidman is stealing the show with her devotion to this movie..I must say that this is a movie that i will never forgetLUMOSand then there was light.....",Moulin Rouge!

1627,TheSparklingDiamond,I am in absolute love with this movie,10,22 October 2001,"This movie was by far the best this year, actually I thought it was the best movie since Romeo and Juliet in 1996. If you are fans of Romeo and Juliet you will looove this movie. I saw it four times and if it was still in the theatre and I had money I would see it again! I love the way Baz uses his camera as his paintbrush and shows us all the emotions and feeling the characters are experiencing with it. Ewan McGregor was amazing as the sweet and innocent Christian (Just look at his eyes!!! They are so genuine!). Many people are complaining about the simplicity of the plot. Well, quite honestly I didn't even notice. I was too astounded by the beauty and wonder of the film. I thought the plot was good actually. So what if it's been done before? Romeo and Juliet had been done a million times and Baz still found a way to make it brilliant and original. He did the same with this film. I don't see how anyone could dislike it.",Moulin Rouge!

1629,suelemon,Seen it twice in a week and bought the soundtrack,10,25 October 2001,"Never before have I enthused over ANY film as much as this one.  I came to this site because I wanted to see if others enjoyed it as much as I did. I'm delighted to say that the majority of people feel the same way as me. I knew it was a Baz Luhrmann film, so I knew his approach would be different.  So from the very beginning, he caught my attention.The film has everything, humour, wonderful singing, great songs produced entirely differently to how you've heard them before.  Yes it's a simple love story, but what's wrong with that?  It was delightful to sit back and just be entertained, without having to concentrate on following the plot. I've now been to see it a second time this week and have bought the soundtrack, which is getting played non stop. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys musicals.",Moulin Rouge!
1630,mortenek,Fantastic!,9,29 October 2001,"After my wife had already seen it twice, I had to come along. And I don't regret that. A classic love story in a new, original, outstanding way. The music, costumes, art direction... How do they do it!? Just see it. You don't know what you're missing.",Moulin Rouge!
1631,eloyola,A fantastic romantic story,10,4 November 2001,"The main attraction of this film for me was supposed to be Nicole Kidman: to be able to see in a big picture long close-ups of her... but now that I have seen it twice, I consider the whole film even better than Nicole alone. I love this kind of romantic stories with happy ends (yes, I consider that the end is happy despite of all). There is humor, beauty, good music, dance, color, good actors, good singers, etc.I strongly recommend this film to everyone who likes good cinema",Moulin Rouge!
1632,Moosnail,'Moulin Rouge!' is absolutely fabulous!,10,5 November 2001,"'Moulin Rouge!' is one of the best films to ever grace the silver screen. With its amazing special effects, beautiful songs, and talented cast, it is truly a masterpiece.  Although Baz Luhrmann's creative style may not agree with everyone, it's worth a watch (or six) - if only to hear Ewan McGregor sing!",Moulin Rouge!
1633,steptecular,"Hilarious, ground-breaking, prodigious",10,17 February 2007,"Attention! Only for real musical fans! This is a must see! Some might get taken aback and shocked by the unusual editing, strange camera angles, harsh make-up, and the overflowing emotions, but this all is what it's meant to be about: truth, beauty, freedom and love!!!!!!! And much more fun: no boundaries, no limits, no prudery, and the key message for everyone: fight for LOVE, no matter what the circumstances are! Just a quote for everyone around the globe: ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return!"" Excellent spectacle, excellent actors, excellent story, excellent visualization, excellent musical flicks, excellent artistic achievement of an excellent artistic mind: Baz Luhrman!

Moulin Rouge was a sad but quite funny movie with great acting bt THE HOTTEST GUY EVER Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. A movie has never made me feel like that did and I cannot wait until it is released to own. Unfortunately I have only seen it twice do to the lack of major movie theaters lack of playing it. The critics hacked this great love musical and they don't understand the hard work and awesome songs that went into it. Luckily I was able to get the Moulin Rouge soundtrack and never get tired of it. This movie gets 2 thumbs up, 10 stars, and my ultimate seal of approval.

Suddenly it turned out to be a very gentle description of a loving couple... An ordinary love movie, yes, but in a very hot and flashing package! Perhaps something for a couple in the middle age that seen it all, to enjoy?",Moulin Rouge!
1641,Toowtie,Spectacular feast for all senses,10,20 January 2002,This is such an original idea for a movie that I was blown away the first time I saw it. It made me feel all the emotions that a movie is supposed to make you feel and all in under two hours. The vibrant colors and cinematography of this movie made it that much more entertaining. Not to mention the believable electricity between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. I was taken into this fantasy world of song and dance effortlessly by Baz Lurhman and it left me longing for more!,Moulin Rouge!
1642,writerserenyty,"Entertaining, but an overall disappointment",5,30 September 2007,"I just saw Moulin Rouge for the first time last night, and I had high hopes for it. I knew it was a musical, and I'd heard raving reviews from friends, telling me that this movie was something I NEEDED to see.Well, I have to say, I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't say it's something that anyone really needs to see.First, I'll just mention things I DID like: The visual effects, the overall setting, was beautiful. Everything about those were beautiful, and if effects and set design interests you, DEFINITELY see this film, because you won't be disappointed. I also thought that, on another note, the acting was good, too. There weren't any horrible actors, but no one really shined. I'd say, if anyone, Ewan McGregor did great. On that same subject, the singing was fantastic all around. I was VERY impressed.However, the film just fell apart other than that. First off, the whole concept somewhat eludes me. What genre is it, exactly? For a while it seems to be almost a comedy and then, periodically, most notably the ending, was a complete tragedy. Was this intended to play with our emotions? If so, they failed in that aspect, as I was just confused.Another thing that has been debated over and over is the song usage. I personally would have preferred the music to be what it was at the real Moulin Rouge at that time period in France. The set, and the effects engross you in that time, but the music just brings you right back. I really didn't like the use of modern music at all.One thing I didn't really see, which would have made it much better, was a chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, or even a better... passion between the two of them. When I get really into a certain couple, or just really like one, they don't just have a good story, there must be a level of chemistry. And I just didn't sense it between Satine and Christian. They certainly had a lot of romantic scenes, but I've felt a LOT more chemistry between characters that rarely, if ever, get romantic scenes together (Ex: Mulder and Scully from The X-Files). I apparently missed the passion between these two.All in all, Moulin Rouge's was interesting, and certainly entertaining, but I just didn't think it was as great as some of the reviews make it out to be.",Moulin Rouge!
1643,irishbean82,loved every moment!!!!!,10,22 November 2001,"I loved Moulin Rouge it was the greatest movie, I can not wait until it comes out on video. I honestly thought that it was so entertaining Nicole Kidman, and Ewan McGregor have really good voices. I don't want to spoil this movie, I am sure that if you love singing and dancing & musicals that you will love this one!!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1644,bigs16,It was spectacular spectacular! :),10,2 December 2001,"This movie was so amazing! The voices were beautiful and so were the scenes. Amazing cinematography and imagination. Wonderful music and plot. It made me laugh, smile, want to sing, and yes, even cry. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. See it with an open mind. Know that it's not ""normal"" and that it will be ""strange,"" but it will go beyond your wildest dreams and make you want to see it over and over again. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were amazing. Who knew they could sing like that?! After seeing it once, you (like me) will want to add it to your film collection.",Moulin Rouge!
1645,jamesw90,So boring I did the crossword.,1,3 December 2001,"Moulin Rouge is a one joke film. Once that joke has been used several times it becomes tedious.The film has no trace of originality, and the plot is the worst kind of farce. A better example of a doomed love triangle has to be Shakespeare in Love which is much fresher and wittier than this.The singing is weak and goes on endlessly. It's a pity that Jim Broadbent , who was excellent in Topsy Turvy, was so poorly used in this film. Nicole Kidman, supposedly a courtesan, was about as alluring as a cold fish.The disappointment came from having heard such rave reviews about it. I am afraid that I could think of several hundred better films than this. Could anyone seriously say that this is the 'best film they have ever seen' as I have been told? Alfred Hitchcock must be turning in his grave!",Moulin Rouge!
1646,Bryan82,A word on Moulin Rouge,10,2 January 2002,I love this movie.  I first saw it in the theaters and I loved the music and the spectacle.  It's so trippy!!  Then a friend of mine bought me the DVD for Christmas and now I love the story as well as the rest.  I have watched it so many times with all my friends and I love to watch them watch it so I can see how they react.  I am very grateful to Baz Luhrmann and the cast and writers and all for bringing back the movie musical.  I hope the trend catches on and I hope they make a play from this movie soon!!,Moulin Rouge!
1647,ARealPhoebe,Visually Explosive!,10,8 December 2001,"Moulin Rouge is one of the best movies I have seen. In addition to being visually stunning, the song and dance bit is very entertaining. McGregor and Kidman have great chemistry, and the tragic love story blends well with the modern day songs chosen. This movie is terrific, and after seeing Romeo and Juliet you will definitely notice that this type of visually spectacular movie is Baz Luhrman's style of choice. A must-see!!",Moulin Rouge!

1649,MotionpictureLvr,It took me two times...,9,18 April 2007,"The first time I saw this it was truly mind-boggling, in the really confusing sort of way. I couldn't follow it at all. Regardles It made and impression so I had to watch it again. I did and it was mind- boggling but in the amazing unbelievable way. This has seriously been the best and most original musical I have set my eyes on. The outrageous characters accompany an equally outrageous set. It seemed like every single song, scene, and sentence conveyed the director's (movie's) message. It truly engaged my mind in seeking an answer to the age old question... what is the meaning of life? Why are we here?... The best part about the movie was when it was over my mind had satisfactory answers. I knew I hadn't really learned anything I didn't know before but the trip was worth taking.",Moulin Rouge!
1650,fegatoinaffitto,simply love!,10,16 December 2001,"in what do you believe? i guess everyone of us believe in love, beauty, freedom and verity! and this movie show us how these 4 things could bring peace and delirium, goodness and evilness, sadness and happiness. this movie isn't just a story about love, is a demonstration through music, through images guided by an amazing direction and photography of how love can change our point of view in life, our vision af what's around us!Not just a cold explanation of a story, in this movie story and images are melting, each one using the other one to show what love is! and above all the moulin rouge, symbol of freedom and craziness, just what's love is. Great Baz!",Moulin Rouge!
1651,allispossible01,Truly Brilliant,10,17 December 2001,"I have never seen a movie like this, my first thought was this is different, I  usually dislike any movie with singing all the way through it but I must say I enjoyed this movie so so much it is one of the greatest. I enjoyed it because it moved me inside I felt I was within the movie and the music was excellent I have bought the CD and now I want to buy the Video so I can keep it forever as I think this is a movie that I will never forget. The costumes, the scenes made you feel like you were transported into a world of fantasy. Absolutely Unforgetable and truly brilliant.",Moulin Rouge!
1652,wrigley-1,Absolutely fantastic,10,21 December 2001,"I saw Moulin Rouge twice at the cinema and now own the DVD.  I must say, out of the majority of movies I have seen, this one is the most unique and dazzling of movies I have ever had the privilege of viewing.I would recommend seeing this on DVD.  There is so much extra footage - you can even see some of the songs from different angles!!",Moulin Rouge!
1653,angelact21,There's Magic in Moulin Rouge,10,23 December 2001,"Earlier this year, two friends of mine and I decided to go see a movie. Seeing as we already saw the other big blockbusters Pearl Harbor and The Mummy 2 (like everyone else in the world), we thought we'd take our chances seeing Moulin Rouge.  After reading a few negative articles about it beforehand, as I was buying my ticket and walking into the theater, I thought this movie was going to be a complete waste of my time and money... I have never been so wrong.  Director Baz Luhrmann has the gift of taking his audience into a world we could never imagine.  At the begining there are so many twist and turns and suprises, you feel as if your head is about to explode, but he then slows it down to a pace where the audience is able to ""act"" like they are calm, but their adrenaline is still vastly going. Uniquely, Luhrmann takes 19th century pop songs as the musical basis, remixes from the Beetles, Elton John, David Bowie, and Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" are just a few.  Nicole Kidman gives a beautiful performance as the heroine Satine.  Her dancing, singing, acting, all lovely combined; I could not think of anyone better for the role.  The real surprise, however, came at the point where Ewan McGregor (know to many as ""that one dude in Star Wars""), began to burst into song.  His voice resembles that of a mix between Elton John and Sting (sorry if you disagree).  His acting performance shines through and through in each scene, and during the ""Elephant Love Melody"", any woman would wish it was her up on the screen and Nicole out of the picture.  But then one comes back to reality and realizes that unfortunately, this is only a movie.  One with dazzling special effects, beautiful costumes, amazing scenery, breathtaking performances, and soulful singing.  If Moulin Rouge does not win an Oscar in 2002 for best picture as well as in many other categories, I will not only be surprised, but disappointed in the Academy that they do not know an Awardwinning movie when they see one.",Moulin Rouge!
1654,sparky3391,fantastic blend of visuals and audio - thoroughly enjoyable,9,23 December 2001,"This movie is a fantastic blend of sumptuous visuals of 1900 Paris (and then some) and sharp entertaining audio from present day.  It captures your imagination immediately, and sweeps you into a fantasy world of sites and sounds. The eye-candy is amazing, and the vocal performances are rich.  It was meant to be a one-time rental, but we have watched it over and over, seeing new things each time.  A wonderful film.",Moulin Rouge!
1655,Lady_Arwen,Spectacular Spectacular!!,10,28 December 2001,"I absolutely adored this movie!! I had heard great reviews from many people but had not seen it for myself till recently and I had to watch it again when it was finished! The story was touching and the spectacle was amazing! It was colourful and attention-holding! The songs were appropriate and humourous with interjections of ""modern"" songs in what was supposed to be a story that took place in 1899! The performances of Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman and John Leguizamo were incredible! The viewer must maintain a suspension of disbelief however, since this movie follows along the lines of a great musical... but to fall in love with this movie is what I have done, and as Ewan's character says... love is all you need!",Moulin Rouge!
1656,bofh69,Worst movie I've ever seen.,1,27 December 2001,"Whoever wrote this screenplay should be shot.  There were some unique camera effects, but they made no sense in the context of the movie.  The usage of modern music was strained at best.  All in all, I couldn't stand to watch more than the first half hour.",Moulin Rouge!

Who is the lead of the Moulin Rouge's Can Can Dancers. He indulges",10,30 December 2001,"This movie is Spectacular Spectacular!! It gives you great excitment and is very enthusiastic. But, it is very surprising that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor could ever sing! How come they never did before? It is a romantic love story. However, the one thing I learned from it was........just to love and to be loved in return.",Moulin Rouge!
1658,hairygary42,Not for everyone,10,30 December 2001,"I really loved this movie.  I had no interest in getting up for anything during this movie.  I can't say how long I have been looking for a movie that reflects my interest and taste.  It's been a REAL long time.  The only thing that usually comes close is a Cohen Brothers production or foreign.I remember reading reviews when this first came out in the theatres that you are either going to love or hate this movie.  I can see why.  This is very much done in a theatrical style rather than cinematic.  The fourth wall and distance in locale are ignored, so if you aren't familiar and comfortable with that stage technique, you will find yourself confused.  Think fantasy, not reality.I loved the music.  Again, you will often hear that it contains covers of pop music.  However, they are done in musical theatre style.  So if you don't like musical theatre, don't bother.  Also if you tend to be a bit fanatical about covers.The costumes and art direction are top notch.  But, they contain the surrealism of the theatre.  So, if you have a real aversion to high art, skip it.In a nutshell, if you are looking to see a Julia Roberts movie, rent one. This isn't it.  But. if you are looking for something a little deeper and artistic, see ""Moulin Rouge!""",Moulin Rouge!
1659,emclaugh-1,Very enjoyable movie!,10,26 January 2002,"This is one of  the most enjoyable movies I've seen in years. A bit of everything..Great Music, dancing, humour! I loved the set which looked like a painting come alive. I laughed at the start..and cried at the ending..",Moulin Rouge!
1660,iago666,Self indulgent direction leads to Trainwreck,1,2 January 2002,"The story was O.K....and if I could edit out all of the director's self indulgent garbage this movie might actually be watchable.  It would only be about 20 minutes long, but it would be watchable.The camera spins and whirls and the edits jump from one pointless, bizarre angle to another with such blurring speed it numbs the mind.  You can tell that the director and editor know this is distracting, as anytime something that is important to the story happens the camera angles return to normal, and the awful adaptations of contemporary songs fade to nothing.Kidman and McGregor are great, as is the rest of the cast.  The direction, however seems at times non-existant.",Moulin Rouge!
1661,ilovetucker,Ewan McGregor and whole cast are fabulous!,10,3 January 2002,"Moulin Rouge! may be highly regarded as a nonsense picture but if you really immerse yourself in the characters and realize that it IS a musical, the reaction you are left with is total aw.Besides being hilariously funny, Moulin Rouge! is a deeply moving story and touches my heart very closely.  The songs are performed magnificantly and the acting by the whole cast is outstanding.  Putting aside the fact that Ewan McGregor is my favorite actor, he and Nicole Kidman do a wonderful job of expressing the facial characteristics and acting qualities that bring this movie to life.  Do not take other's opinions, see this movie for yourself and decide.  This movie was not meant for you to feel as if you were ""there"" but actually is crafted to remind you that you are watching and enjoying a movie...a very superb movie.Keep heading for the stars Ewan!!!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1662,Se7en Son,Simply Beautiful,9,5 January 2002,"Not being a fan of musicals, I was rather unsure about this film. But when I heard that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were in it, I thought that it deserved a chance. After hearing the rave reviews from friends, I finally sat down and watched this puppy. Mindblowing! It's the only way to describe the movie. Beautifully filmed, with romance and music that tugged my heartstrings in all the right ways. The performances by McGregor and Kidman were dead-on and Jim Broadbent was pure genius. Plus, that Unconscious Argentinian was quite funny. Sit down and watch this movie, you'll be glad you did.
Cheers!",Moulin Rouge!
1663,ifroelich,an emotional roller-coaster ride,1,19 March 2002,"I didn't know whether to cry, laugh, or run out in horror. Cry at the truly awful acting singing, laugh at all the scenes that took themselves too seriously, or run out in horror or it all. It was as if the movie set out to be an art film much too deliberately. In the back of my mind, I thought, surely, this movie must get better than this. So I stayed.I have read that this film was bold, innovative, emotionally moving, musically glorious. I apologize to all those who loved it, but I cannot share your joy. Unfortunately, it left me cold, and gravely disappointed in the plot, the weak characters, and the truly horrific acting and singing.Particularly bad, was the ""love song"", which resembled the result a web search for love songs that was then strung together. Ack!",Moulin Rouge!
1664,chantydog,Brilliant!,9,4 May 2007,"This film is a wonderful work of art in every sense. From the theatrical opening sequence, to the brilliant colors and dazzling sets, you realize this is not just another movie musical. A story of love and the hazards thereof, that is as old as time, yet brought to life with the use of modern songs and music. Many of the tunes were originally solo performances, now broken into duets that seem to breathe new life into the lyrics. The direction is crisp, moving forward with the speed and agility of the lovers themselves. This cast is without question universally talented. The singing is strong, the dance clean, and the acting passionate and powerful without going over the top. Worth watching over and over again!",Moulin Rouge!
1665,number2414,Is it sick to love a movie this much?,10,5 January 2002,"This is my favorite movie of 2001.  The sets, the acting, the singing, the costumes ... My God, it's so damn good!  Goes to show you that a musical can still make it today's world.  And who knew that Nicole and Ewan could really sing?  I was never much of a Nicole Kidman fan before.  Now I can't get enough of her.  See this movie, twice!",Moulin Rouge!
1666,ice_princess_lhs,IT KICKED ASS!!!!,10,6 January 2002,"This movie will definately be one that I buy, It was beyond excellent. It was moving and funny and sad all at the same time. Ewan McGregor did a devine Job with Nicole Kidman. I have an obsseion with Ewan and He is beyong excellent in the movie and his voice is outstanding. This is the first movie I have seen with him in it and some of the facial expression he makes while singing can really turn you on.",Moulin Rouge!
1667,mbanner,Stupid Stupid,1,7 May 2007,"I am amazed at how bad this movie was and how my wife and I could barely make it through the first 30 minutes, saying to each other, ""perhaps it will get better..."" It never did! To watch this and enjoy it, you have to be either very drunk, on drugs, or disturbed psychologically. Just think a very colorful, in your face 2 hour music video that makes no sense. I understand what the director was trying to do, but why he did it this way and why it earned so much praise just boggles my mind. I think the director telegraphs his desires for the audience near the beginning, that everyone get as high on absinthe as its characters do. Only then, will this ridiculous movie be appreciated. Spectacular Spectacular? No! More like Stupid Stupid.",Moulin Rouge!
1668,hashwee,Everything You Could Possibly Want In A Movie Reinvented and Served Up Hot!,10,9 January 2002,"Moulin Rouge has taken it's place at the top of my favourite movies of all time. It makes me lift my skirt above my head and show my knickers to the world it's so wonderful. It has so much packed into it, and it's all combined skillfully by brilliant director/writer Baz Luhrmann. Comedy, music, singing, tragedy, amazing costumes, beautiful sets, amazing special effects, a fast paced and consistant tone, sexuality, violence, brilliant acting, beautiful people, a 360 world of truth, beauty, freedom and love. It will leave you with feelings I can't even describe in words.
The most amazing thing about this movie is that you notice something new everytime you watch it. That's been my experience, in any case. There is just so much to see, that even after seeing it 15, yes, 15 times I still notice something new. For example, did you notice that when Satine and Zidler come out from the girl's dresses after changing that Zidler is actually in his underwear? Took me 15 times to notice. He's covering his naughty bits and everything.Nicole Kidman is amazing. Ewan McGregor is brilliant. They are truly two very talented people who deserve all the recognition in the world.Of course I love this film. Having said that, it's very true that this is one of those love it or hate it films. Some people cannot stand this movie. It's either one or the other big extreme of enjoyment of this film, and I haven't met anyone who has fallen in the middle of loving/hating the movie at the same time. People get snagged on the simplicity of the plotline. See below about the ""red curtain"" filmmaking style. Keep in mind you may just hate it, and it's a personal thing. But keep in mind that I will hate you for hating this movie. Oops. Did I say that? This sentiment, however, is shared with many. People are so attached to this film that anyone who just didn't like it ""just because"" become absolute morons in the Rougehead's eyes.I cannot reccommend this movie enough. You must see Moulin Rouge. It is so different from everything out there. This ""red curtain"" style of filmmaking that Luhrmann embraces (placing a simple plot in a heightened world) is a truly magnificent thing. He's done it before (Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliette) but never on this level. See it and learn from what it brings to the medium of filmmaking.",Moulin Rouge!
1669,LagunaMom,What A Waste!,2,10 January 2002,"No doubt about it: This movie is gorgeous.  But all the fancy director's tricks, the magnificant sets and costumes, the splendid screen presence and chemistry of its main characters and Ewan McGregor's voice can't mask a weak script, little character development, and very little good music to call its own.  (I mean, if you're going to rip-off someone else's hits, make sure you can do them one better.)  This is strictly eye candy.  Not only is much of the music awful (we were laughing hysterically for a couple of days as we sang a few words from one of them at my house), but also the choreography is uninspiring (just take a few looks at ""Singin' In The Rain"".) The one fine, original song was the ensemble piece sung when the cast was trying to sell its production to the buyer.  As a long-time fan of musicals, I was disappointed and even angry at the waste of talent in this film.  No doubt about it: The best film musicals of the past decade or so have been Disney-animated films. Just on the basis of music alone, this falls far short of the high standards set by Howard Ashman (may he rest in peace), Alan Mencken, Tim Rice, and Elton John.  Want to enjoy Moulin Rouge?  Then turn off the sound.",Moulin Rouge!

1671,jimbaird-1,"A really bad, inane, MTV mishmash.",1,18 February 2002,"My wife and I watch as much of this mess as we could stand, about 25 minutes.  It is an utterly inane riot.  The mix of songs was a laugh, but not funny.  Time Magazine said ""You've never seen anything like it"".  I hope I never have to again.  I cannot understand how Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for her over the top role.  The whole thing was just awful. It had nothing to do with 1900 Paris.  Of course, most of the audience wouldn't know the difference.  So sad.  It was a wonderful time.",Moulin Rouge!
1672,simonhopwooduk,Stunning!,10,12 April 2002,It has taken me quite some time to get around to watching this film. I always thought of it as a 'chick flick' but kept hearing such good reviews that I thought I'd give it a go and buy a copy. After the first half-hour or so I realised that I hadn't stopped smiling since the beginning and it continued to blow me away until the end. This film is simply like nothing else I have ever seen and is constantly jaw-dropping. It is definitely one I will watch again and again. I can understand if people don't like this film (even though I don't usually but still enjoyed it) but the people who hate it with a passion really confuse me. If you hate this film so much that you have to post comments full of swearing then I think you ought to go see a doctor. At the end of the day it's only a film. The best film I've seen in AGES!,Moulin Rouge!
1673,greg_nw,"What a let-down. Could have been titled ""Great Expectations""",3,15 January 2002,"I love a good musical. Based on all the glowing reviews about this movie, we rented the DVD and sat back to experience. Wow! After about 30 minutes, we began wondering if this was really it. I kept expecting it to change gears and shift into the ""wonderful musical"" we had heard/read about. Instead, we were treated to the first movie in years to be turned-off before it was over.This movie/musical is a hodge-podge of snippets from many movies and songs of the past 30 years, or so. From ""Hello Dolly"" (now that was an entertaining musical) to ""Sound of Music"". From Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"", to Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". It appears to have been put together like a collage. Someone cut-out a number of songs, and routines from previous movies/musicals, and pasted them on a poster-board which then became the outline of this musical.Thin plot line. Voices of the leads that lacked depth. Very impressionistic. The most positive thing I can say is that Nicole did look rather nice in some of the costumes she was wearing.All in all, I think of this as the ""Scary Movie"" of musicals.",Moulin Rouge!
1674,4hartthreat,Absolutely brilliant,10,2 April 2002,"Moulin Rouge is a movie unlike any other. It tells the simplest of stories in a most unsimple way. This movie is so original and so amazing, that is must be seen more than once to truly take in all of its greatness. It's a shame that the Academy went with the ""been there, done that"" A Beautiful Mind, and ignored the originality that is Moulin Rouge. Nicole Kidman is fantastic, and deserved the Oscar for this performance, which shows all of her range, from comedy, to singing, to heartbreaking drama. Ewan McGreggor is also very good, as is Jim Broadbent, who really won his Oscar for this performance, despite what movie he was nominated for. Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film that dared to be bold and original, and offer up something new and fresh to movie goers. It succeeded in giving us a movie that will be around for a long time. It's just a shame that as usual, when someone tries something different, the old guard stands up and shouts that they like things the way they are, and take every chance they get to bad mouth the new thing, and attempt to keep things the same. To you all I say too bad, because while there are lots of you out there, the majority has seen the light, and this movie is being embraced like none I've ever seen before. Its 8 Oscar nominations are a good indicator of that. To anyone who has not seen this movie, give it a chance, it may surprise you, as it did I, in the most spectacular spectacular of ways.",Moulin Rouge!
1675,chbrandon,Experience is Absolutely Enthralling!,9,23 January 2002,"To view this movie, one must prepare to lose oneself in the greatness of Baz Luhrmann's imagination.  I had initially seen this movie in theatre and could not just watch it once.  I had to return again and again.  And every time I was there, I would lose myself in the world that is the Moulin Rouge! And now that I have had the opportunity to include it in my own DVD collection it has not left my player for very long.I have been a fan of Luhrmann's since I had the opportunity to watch ""Strictly Ballroom"" and that in turn led me to see ""Romeo + Juliet"" But after watching ""Moulin Rouge!"", I am convinced that this man is a genius. The costumes and the set design compliment his vision of Paris at the turn of the century.  Plus his choice of the colours, the lighting and the shading, highlight or accent the emotions and the drama of each scene as they unfold.And where to begin with the score?  To hear modern songs sung in the style of a ""rock opera"" just absolutely blew my mind.  Your senses will soar every time a character breaks out in song.  The medleys are inspiring and you could see that each actor put himself/herself on the line to perform the numbers.  Their dedication is evident, and makes the songs more powerful and wonderful. The chance they all took to sing with such emotion and strength, is something to admire and be amazed by. And don't worry, the choreography is not out done by the music, rather it's on equal ground.  The dance sequences are absolutely magical and tell a story itself.
If you take a step back to just lose yourself in the movie, you will have a moment of clarity and fully understand what Luhrmann is all about.  The vastness that is his imagination is captured in all of the elements that make up the masterpiece that is the Moulin Rouge!But this film would not have been as brilliant or so inspiring if it wasn't for the cast, and especially Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  They were so real that the audience could not help but feel what the two forbidden lovers felt, and saw what they saw.  The talent that these two possess is unlimited and they definitely gave Satine and Christian the depth and development that they richly deserved.If you dismissed ""Moulin Rouge!"" the first time around, don't pass it up on your next opportunity.  This is definitely a movie that will leave you breathless by the time the curtain closes.  And you will want to experience that intensity all over again.",Moulin Rouge!
1676,mbeyerl,ANNOYING,1,2 February 2002,"ohhh but it is sooo ""original"" and ""one-of-a-kind"", is what I heard and what i read.. allow me to clarify the situation.. the creators of this film obviously possess some talent.. and lots of money..but! every aspect of this film is completely annoying.. the characters, the set, the music,the editing.... ect ect.. made me sick to watch it",Moulin Rouge!
1677,gtjorge,couldn't believe two hours could be so long!,1,26 January 2002,I couldn't believe two hours could be so long. I kept waiting and waiting for the movie to end. From the first ten minutes it was downhill and it kept going downhill. Everything but the kitchen sink - from Nature Boy to Camille. Nothing original anywhere. Jim Broadbent was hideously miscast and the whole movie looked like a bad acid trip from the 60's. No wonder the musical is dead.,Moulin Rouge!
1678,thelaker,Spectacular~Spectacular,10,10 February 2002,"Wow! This film gets better every time I see it. I think women will like this movie more than men.  You certainly have to appreciate music to really enjoy this film.  I for one was amazed when I realized both Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor sang their own songs.  Much to my surprise, they EXCELLED at it! Kidman sizzles as Satine! MacGregor additionally is a Huge talent(ha ha) and shouldn't be overlooked.  His voice dazzles me.  I love Ewan's character Christian and his ""anything is possible with love"" approach!  Nicole does a marvelous job with transforming Satine from a call girl to a woman in love after Christian sings ""Your Song"" to her.  Her entire demeanor changes after this and from that point on I am hooked!  This scene is very funny as she tries to hide Christian from The Duke.  Baz Luhrmann does a fantastic job with this movie!  This movie will make you laugh and cry.  I recommend watching this movie more than once as I notice something new every time. I have to tell you that this is one of the most entertaining movies that I have seen in awhile. Enjoy!",Moulin Rouge!
1679,angelaandrews-1,Delightful surprise,10,4 February 2002,"When this movie first came out I was not interested at all, but then I watched it the other night on PPV (nothing better to do) I was totally BLOWN AWAY!!!

It seems impossible to get tired of this movie, with all its amazing momentum, lush color, and unique vision.  The music pulls you in, and everything else keeps you coming back.  Watch it once to be amazed, and again to appreciate.  I do acknowledge that this movie may not be for everyone, but I do think that it deserves to be seen for more than a novelty.  It deserves to be appreciated for the achievement it is.  WATCH IT, LOVE IT.",Moulin Rouge!
1681,upjchick286,One in a million!,10,6 February 2002,"For those who think of this film as a disaster, do not have any sense of art.  It is just like those people who do not understand what is so intriguing about a dark hard to see image on canvas, you have no understanding.  Ah yet people are entitled to their own opinions, my request is to sit down and think.  Put yourself in the place of that particular person.  The film was nothing less than extraordinary, superb, spectacular spectacular.  Never will you ever see a film quit like this.  I must say I was taken back at first, but yet I watched on and after it made me think. Never have I seen two actors draw you into a film like these two did. Never have I felt as if I was personally there and felt their pain along with their love.  I've watched it over and over again, only to find out more about the film.  This is and will be one of the greatest films made.  No film can make you laugh and cry the way this one can.  Do not watch the film for pure entertainment; watch the film to be put into the film.  It almost makes you feel as if you can not live your life locked away... you never know when your life could be taken next, it makes you appreciate people and loved ones more, especially significant others... my request is to sit down watch it and be involved, then you'll understand why those who love the film love it.",Moulin Rouge!
1682,2borX2b,Absolutely Stunning!,10,7 February 2002,"Moulin Rouge took my breath away and left me wanting more! A love story so tender yet filled with excitement. The voices of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor reach out and caress your soul.I felt as though I were in the audience of a 'spectacular' stage production! Absolutely stunning! A must see for any Musical fan, I find myself humming the songs since watching it a week ago.The Sound of Music has been replaced by Moulin Rouge as my favourite movie of all time!",Moulin Rouge!
1683,knhoang411,I Might Not Be Musically Inclined But.,4,9 February 2002,"I am going to compare `Moulin Rouge' with `Shakespeare In Love' because both of the movies are about a struggling young man and a stunning(and stunningly skinny) beauty sought by a wealthy and callous other man. Both movies are about the love between a writer and a performer within a play. And both movies represent young love with physical passion and sexy young stars.  I admit, the movies cannot be compared in movie making ability, because the styles are so different (MR is more creative visually and stylistically, but SIL is more creative with language, and incorporating-and changing history), but they can be compared on their representations of love.  SIL actually is better at showing true love than MR.  SIL's love affair makes MR's look like over-dramatic puppy love.First, the scenes between Christian and Satine in MR don't display as much love on a intellectual-as well as physical level-as the scenes between Viola and Shakespeare.  Viola's intellect is comparable to Shakespeare's. Viola is actually more realistic than Shakespeare. She realizes-before him-that she can cherish what she has with Shakespeare forever, but must marry Wessex in order to allow Shakespeare to continue to create what they both love-plays. Indeed, their love is based on a greater love. In MR, Christian seems somewhat educated, but Satine doesn't even realize that coughing up blood means you are going to die-especially without treatment.  Not that Viola and Shakespeare give the impression of intertwined souls, but Christian and Satine just seemed like merely horn dogs who substitute dramatic posturing for love and still think it's the same thing.  Viola and Shakespeare really cared about the play they were creating; they truly wanted to create something together that other people would truly care about.  Christian and Satine created a half-baked play to bolster Satine's career and protect their affair from the duke's immense `intellect.'  Both Christian and Shakespeare were on deadlines but Shakespeare actually cared what he was writing about.I guess one could argue that Christian and Satine shared a love for the Moulin Rouge, since they were only shown to love another within the vicinity of the Moulin Rouge.  But that means that Viola and Shakespeare's love was even more varied. They not only love each other in the playhouse and Viola's bedroom, but outside a church and beside a river.  They did not need a certain surrounding to support their love. Shakespeare didn't care if Viola looked like a woman when he kissed her either.  That either shows true love-or Shakespeare was really horny or kinky or both.
Another argument is that love cannot include jealousy.  The Bible does mention that love is not envious.  Shakespeare is never jealous when Viola is involved. (He is only jealous of Marlowe.) He knows she loves him and not Wessex.  What says more about love than when a person trusts the person they love enough not to be jealous?  In MR though, Christian gets jealous of the Duke because he doesn't trust Satine's love for him.  (Which is incredibly stupid of him because why would Satine even like a dolt like the Duke? Maybe Christian and Satine are an intellectual match after all.)Another thing-Viola wanted to act because she loved it. She didn't even care about the recognition because she acted under the name of Thomas Kent. Satine on the other hand, wanted to act to be a `star.'  Which character shows more true love and passion?  (This argument assumes people think passion for oneself is not as noble as passion for creativity and other people.)",Moulin Rouge!
1684,thethinker597,A disrespectful mess.,2,15 February 2002,"What I found most offensive about this film (besides the grotesque faces jumping at me every two seconds, and the icey-chill of that overrated Nicole Kidman) was the way they portrayed Toulouse-Lautrec. If you know anything of the artist, and then see the beautiful portrayal of him in ""Moulin Rouge"" (the 1952 version) by Jose Ferrer, you can't help but be offended by this new version presenting him as a grinning, hyper, bouncing munchkin who's meant to be a mere sidekick to the mediocre main characters.",Moulin Rouge!
1685,elanor_1421,very brave. very beautiful to look at. acting's not too bad.,9,14 February 2002,"I can't remember much of my first viewing of this film - only that I was dead to the world outside of ""Moulin Rouge"", had some kind of goofy smile plastered on my face all the way through and that my head was reeling by the end. I had come, after steeling myself for disappointment, to be pleasantly surprised and moved - not by the plot or acting, it must be admitted, but by the sheer visual impact of the film and the evident enthusiasm with which it was made. It's a gutsy production, and I admired baz for taking it on. It was not until later viewings (when I finally had room in my brain to process something other than the intoxicating sets, costumes and songs) that I began to appreciate the acting and the plot. Kidman's performance, in particular, had left me strangely cold after the first viewing, while I found McGregor adorable in the wide-eyed innocent role. It is only later, when I finally became familiar with the character of Satine, that I realised Kidman actually turns out a better, more delicate and subtle performance than McGregor. Her character is far more complex and underneath the surface, far more intense, and must have been a greater challenge. Satine is Christian's first love - he will eventually move on. But for Satine, more world-weary, Christian is her first, last, and only chance at living a life with love. All her emotion is invested in this relationship - it is her key to freedom. So, while the plot is simple, classic (and on first viewing appears cliched), it is still a powerful story, pulled off by some pretty decent performances from its actors. After watching the film a few times, you realise that a more complex or even more unfamiliar plot would have made the whole thing into a REAL mess - it would have been too much to juggle and sustain along with all the stylistic elements which, let's face it, make the movie. 1(for plot) +3 (for acting) +5 (for creativity and courage to try something fresh and original)= 9/10",Moulin Rouge!

1687,SquirelzNL,Nothing short of amazing,10,14 April 2002,"This movie was amazing. From the frist seconds to the last scene I was hooked. I was a fan for Baz before this with his films ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" and this is just iceing on the cake of his red curtain. I can't wait until ""Rent"" comes out later this year. In my oppinion, Nicole should have won best actress hands down, and Moulin Rouge should have won best picture.

1688,imyourwes,Unlike Anything Ever Seen,10,22 February 2002,"This film has to be one of the most amazing, ambitious and beautiful films ever made. It captures the essence of a Red Curtain Production, and splashes it onto screen in dazzling, jaw-dropping fashion. The actor's talents and hard work is seen easily in this film, and director Baz Luhrmann has proved to be one of the most influential and creative filmmakers of his generation. Someone with so much vision could easily be called a genius, and it is disheartening to see that he was not nominated for ""Best Director"" by the Academy. If you have not seen this film already in theatres (which you have surely missed out), I cannot recommend it more for rental. The actors, director, everyone involved pulls you into the vivacious and vibrant world that is the Moulin Rouge, and makes the viewer never want to leave it. If the performance aspect is not quite fulfilling to one, the technical views should astonish some, with gutsy editing and the best costume, set and art direction I have seen to date. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",Moulin Rouge!
1689,profseverus,One of a kind Musical,10,30 June 2003,"Many people I heard of, think that Moulin Rouge, is a boring and stupid film... Why? I believe it is a ""one of a kind"" musical. The special combination of old and well-known songs but also the re-making of famous old songs is amazing! It is one of the best, if not the best, musicals I've ever seen... Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are indeed very talented at singing, dancing and acting... Baz is an excellent director with a lot of talent, knowing his work pretty well. All the other cast and crew worked really hard to make a musical that will entertain people and they succeeded, in my opinion. I also love the way they combined music, comedy, action and drama. There are scenes you really laugh your head off and scenes the feel like crying your heart out. I was reading the biography of ""Henry Marie Raymond de Toulouse Lautrec Monfa"", the famouse french artist, and most of the story is based on his life (something really smart to do). The one's that believe that Moulin Rouge!'s music is crap, well sorry folks, but I got to tell you that you are wrong... The music is entertaining and so is the movie...Thank youRATING= 9,5/10 95/100 19/20",Moulin Rouge!

Moulin Rouge combines immaculate settings, a charming storyline, glorious actors and marvellous lyrics to come together to form the film Moulin Rouge! Nicole and Ewan sure put on a very entertaining show. Their singing was magical along with their extraordinary acting performances. They both deserve many awards!! It's not very often a movie such as this comes along. A movie that can be watched over and over again and yet still entangles the viewer into hilarious comedy, spine-tingling drama and tear jerking tragedy. All in all this movie is one of a kind.

1693,chelleypyatt,The Brilliance of Moulin Rouge,10,25 February 2002,"Moulin Rouge has to be one of the greatest films of all time, if not the year.  Dazzling you with incredible editing and brilliant effects shots, it captures your attention and won't let go until the end.  It takes you on a journey of true love and leaves you wanting more. Moulin Rouge begins with the once naive Christian (Ewan McGregor) sitting down at his typewriter to tell his story.  He begins with how he came to Paris to write and live a penniless existence.  And is then greeted by an unconscious Argentinian falling through his roof.  ""And is quickly joined by a dwarf dressed as a nun.""  Talous La Trec.   Talous introduces him to the Bohemian lifestyle and gets him his first job in Paris...writing ""Spectacular, Spectacular"".  Satine ( Nicole Kidman)  the ""Sparkling Diamond"" mistakes Christian for the duke and falls in love with him.  But she is a courtesan and isn't suppose to fall in love with anyone, except the duke, who is financing the conversion of the Moulin Rouge ""into a theater"". Satine is supposed to be his.  Christian and Satine have to hide their love from the duke. But like any forbidden love, they are found out.  The duke forbids her to see Christian or he will be killed.  So Satine makes Christian believe she doesn't love him to protect him from the duke.   Okay that's as far as I'm going to go.  I don't want to give away the ending.  If you want to know, go see it. I have to tell that I was swept up in this film.  I saw it six times in the theater in a time when I couldn't afford to see one movie let alone it six times.  I had to choose between eating and seeing this movie and I chose this movie.  That's how powerful it was.  It is beyond anything else I've seen all year and I've seen alot.  The musical score is fabulous.  Ewan McGregor, although always one of my favorites, went beyond what I thought possible for him. (And should have been nominated for an oscar, but was passed over) And Nicole Kidman, never one of my favorites, showed me that she too can act just as well as anyone and is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  Their voices compliment each other perfectly. The visuals were outstanding.  Never seen effects shots so perfect. Usually I can find something wrong with films, but I couldn't find one single, solitary thing.  Baz did a fantastic job both writing and directing and is one of the most creative directors in the industry today.",Moulin Rouge!

The two leads, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, are great together. They have a very unique chemistry together. Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler is wonderful, and he can even sing!The songs chosen are just right. They fit in perfectly with the story and aren't just there to take up time in the film. I would also like to praise Baz Luhrmann for his outstanding direction of this masterpiece.Faults? Absolutely none.

But on the whole, this movie is not worth the $4 rental fee.I sat through the whole thing waiting for it to get better, and hoping I could gain some insight into why it won a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. No such luck on either front. The plot is weak and unimaginative. The chemistry between MacGregor and Kidman must be hiding behind the Elephant, because I couldn't see it.My advice -- instead of watching this movie, listen to some Weird Al, visit a museum, and watch something else with John Leguizamo in it. I guarantee you'll get more out of the experience than you will from watching this movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1699,Squeekisme,Wow,10,22 September 2002,"I must admit, my primary reasoning for seeing this movie was that of a shallow, teenage girl, I mean, Ewan McGregor is....well, HOT!! But once I had seen this masterpiece I knew it was a stroke of genius. The way Baz (yes, we are on a first name basis) mixed contemporary music with such a moving screen play was amazing. Its tone of humor as well as tragedy is what forces me to watch it over and over. And although I can practically speak right along with the movie, I never tire of it. The true talent of Ewan and Nicole (again, first names here) is realized when you find out that every note and every song is actually them singing!!! I have not been this excited about a musical since Phantom of the Opera, yes, it is that level. So, for those who haven't seen it, do, and for those who have seen it, see it again. And again.

I suspect it will do well with the American ""academy"",as it is a tad off-the wall,but any interest beyond that is not warranted. Obviously,the director saw  a couple Fellini classics back in the '70s. For some mis-guided reason,somebody gave him a pile of cash to make a ""musical"".Aside from some interesting technical flashes,there is nothing to redeem this mess.Oh...maybe the ""corporation"" that covers Lady Marmalade,shown as a 3 minute clip at the end of the film...that was the best moment,and the only part of the production that should have been released.Maybe when the people resonsible for this nightmare come down off their'70s induced buzz they will understand...They cannot mess with truely inovative film making..and copying a master never works.",Moulin Rouge!

Ewan McGregor's play somehow reminded me of his act in Big Fish. err vice versa! (I have seen Big Fish sooner than this.) and I should say that maybe no other actress could play just fine as Nicole Kidman for this movie, she deserved what she got for Moulin Rouge!

What I saw was annoying, without any intelligent story and just plain stupid. When we rented the DVD, we were expecting a musical, a love story and a piece of history from one of my favorite cities in the world, Paris. It turned out to be a loud and irritating collage of sound bites and visuals. This can only qualify as a musical for the MTV generation, with the attention span of a gerbil on speed. Seriously, even most of the ""dialogues"" and songs were not original but collected from eras of pop and rock music. I tried to like this movie and a number of friends have tried to explain to me what they love about it. It didn't work. Needless to say I was shocked to see it nominated for best film and was greatly relieved when it didn't win.",Moulin Rouge!
1707,cherry14,the best film ever!!!,10,26 March 2002,I love moulin rouge sooo much! I think the singing and dancing are just brilliant and the love story through it is so good. I think Nicole Kidman is such a good actress and singer. It's such a colourful and exciting film. My favourite part of it is the 'Roxanne' medley. Brilliant 10/10 :),Moulin Rouge!
1708,sumpunk,This is a Great Movie,10,30 March 2002,This movie uses a simple idea of love overcoming all odds and complicates it a bit. Then adds familiar lyrics with some new ones that are along with a great musical score. If you love Theatre or if you just would like to see a great movie you need to see this.,Moulin Rouge!
1709,tommyhoss,The most over-rated movie of all time.,1,30 March 2002,"Very over rated and hyped. Senseless, no nudity, and a very overdone storyline. It was hard to follow at times. It left me asking ""why?"". Why was this movie made? Why did it get nominated for anything? And why do so many people like this? Just goes to show how easily amused some people are.",Moulin Rouge!
1710,lexa_blue,This movie really stinks!,1,1 April 2002,"Not only is it a ripoff of an opera (La Traviata, as well as La Boheme), but it is awfully written and has terrible versions of beautiful songs.  The acting leaves much to be desired.  I guess that the choreography was good, but its hard to tell because of the RCM (rapid camera movement).I really wish that I could vote in negative numbers....",Moulin Rouge!
1711,MrGorgeous,Awful Film!,2,4 January 2003,"I saw Moulin Rouge last night for the first time. I had some expectations, but not too much. What i saw was an awful film, only Kidman was worth to see. I never stop watching during a film, but now i did. I was disgusted what i saw. A poor musical with stupid acts. People, don't spend your money on this!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1712,twix322,Spectacular Spectacular!,10,4 June 2002,"*Contains spoilers!*This is by far, the best movie I have ever seen.When I first heard of it, I didn't really know much about it. Then one of my friends who was extremely obsessed with it was talking about it all the time and I thought, ""You know, I'll just see it so I know what she's talking about.""And I LOVED it!Christian, a penniless poet who lives in middle-class London, goes off to Montmartre, Paris to become part of the Bohemian Revolution. While he's there, he meets up with the Bohemian Hobos, led by the French artist, Toulouse-Lautrec. They are amazed by his Bohemian-ish style and decide for him to write the show that is going to be put on by the Moulin Rouge. While he's there at the Moulin Rouge, he is to present his poetry to Satine, the Sparkling Diamond(A courtesan at the Moulin Rouge). She mistakes him for the Duke, who is the investor of the show. Christian and Satine fall in a star-crossed love that eventually, everyone knows about except the Duke. Also, practically no one knows that Satine is slowly dying of consumption. The more Christian and Satine's love grows, the harder it is to keep a secret. When the Duke gets suspicious of a relationship between them, Satine offers to sleep with him to prove there is no such thing. During supper, the Duke finally figures out the love between Satine and Christian. He attempts to rape her and...Well, I'll let you find out. Anyway, later Christian and Satine decide they are going to leave the Moulin Rouge even if the show is the next day. Satine goes to pack her things and meets Zidler there. Zidler tells her that the Duke is going to kill Christian if she doesn't sleep with him opening night and the show doesn't go his way. Satine still persists and makes another attempt to leave, but then Zidler breaks the news to her that she's dying. He convinces her to tell Christian she doesn't love him for his sake. Christian is heartbroken and goes to the Moulin Rouge to ""pay his whore"" before he leaves. Satine's life is coming to an end and at the end of the show, she's able to tell Christian she still loves him before she dies in his arms.*wipes a tear from her cheek* My, I'm good at making a short story long, aren't I?Moulin Rouge is basically everything you want in a movie. Humor, drama, music and above all things, love! It is ""a story about love,"" after all. :)The mix between turn of the century Paris and 20th century songs is amazing! They use songs such as, ""Your Song,"" ""Roxanne,"" and a hilarious version of ""Like A Virgin."" That's just a few of the wonderful songs sung in Moulin Rouge.Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christain) do a phenomenal job in the singing, dancing and acting(Every note they sing is their own voice). Co-stars, John Leguizamo (Toulouse-Lautrec), Jim Broadbent (Harold Zidler) and Richard Roxburgh (The Duke) also do a delightful job.The way Baz Luhrmann (director) presents Moulin Rouge is beautiful. The special effects are just amazing!The death scene is...Well, I can't really think of words to explain it; I don't remember a time I've seen the movie and NOT cried!Most likely, you have now realized I LOVE the movie and I hope you go out and see the movie if you already haven't!",Moulin Rouge!
1713,imamoviemaker11,phenomenal movie; 10 out of 10,10,29 April 2002,"When I first watched Moulin Rouge on DVD, I wanted to kick myself. No, not because I spent money on a bad movie. In fact, the opposite of that. I wished I had believed the reviews and gone to see it in the theater. Hopefully one day they will rerelease it, for this is the kind of movie that would most likely be phenomenal on the big screen. Anyway, Moulin Rouge is breathtaking and ground breaking at the same time. It's not your traditional musical; often you can't even tell when the singing stops and the talking begins. There are many references to songs from the 20th century, which I enjoyed, in a comical way, hearing in this sense. The music and dance direction is wonderful. Each number is better than the last. And the movie doesn't stop there. In fact, after viewing the whole movie, this is not the major part I remember. The story, the script, the lyrics... they're all so beautiful. ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return"". ""This movie is about freedom, truth, beauty, and above all things, love."" While these might seem cliche and corny, the way these ideas are presented are so that the viewer actually believes them. Last but not least, the characters of the film are great. I especially enjoyed Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge who defines the word thrifty. At some points it may seem like he is the antagonist, or one of them, but at most times he is on the side of good, of love. There's so much more about Moulin Rouge that's wonderful, but it would take the length of the script to write it all, if not more. Every line is wonderful, and to compound on that the acting, singing, dancing, editing, costumes... EVERYTHING is wonderful. So please, if you have not seen this movie, see it.And remember:The greatest thing You'll ever learn Is just to love And be loved In return",Moulin Rouge!
1714,snapfish87,This movie kicks a**!,10,16 April 2002,"I luv Moulin Rouge. Its one of the best movies ive ever seen. It rulz! I cried the first two times i saw it. Everyone should c this film! The actors sacrificed a ton for this movie (for example nichole breaking bones in rehersal, which cost her the lead in the box office hit ""panic room""), and i think that its so cool that Ewan McGregor and Nichole Kidman both sang all of their songs. I luv this movie, and if u don't, then ur messed up.",Moulin Rouge!
1715,KatoNLee,What an experience!!,10,29 April 2002,"So I didn't see this film at the cinema. I must say that the trailer didn't do it justice and I had no idea what to expect. It was on a flight to South Africa I watched and was totally in awe of the style and power of the film. Right from the opening scenes in the night club I was completely hooked. This film really is an experience. I found myself wrapped up in the fabulous performances, the incredible music, the romance and the bohemian idealism, escaping all to realise their dreams.This film really is outstanding. Imagine my horror when the landing at Johanesburg interupted the film with 20 minutes to go. I was desperate to see the end and had to wait five days for the return flight to find what happens.Extraordinary!!!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1716,rossogr,The beauty and truth of Moulin Rouge,10,6 May 2002,"How to begin to describe the way that Moulin Rouge will make you feel? This movie breathes of sentiment.  Baz Luhrmann created a masterpiece, a story about love that will make you laugh, cry and most important feel. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are incredible, I can't imagine a more perfect couple and their presence will remain in your mind and heart for a long time. Everything in this movie is so rich:  acting, music, choreography, scenery, sentiment.  The movie itself is a feast for the eyes and the music is perfectly combined with the scenes that accompanies. Baz Luhrmann has pushed musicals one step beyond.  The whole film is grand and you can easily understand how much time, hard work and love was spent in every detail. Apart of its perfection the strength of the film comes from its powerful story, its theatrical feeling and the alchemy of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mc Gregor.  I feel that I can't really express the impact that this movie had on me, it's being a long time since a work of art moved me so much. Baz Luhrmann offers us a great gift, if you believe that there are things that can lift your spirit higher, shake you and awaken your heart and soul, this is one of them.",Moulin Rouge!
1717,justin_mcconnell,"Terrible, John Huston rolls in his grave!",1,7 May 2008,"This film is evidently meant to be a more light-hearted telling of a dramatic and tragic tale told previously before on film, most notably by the great John Huston back in the 50s. However, as with his other films, Baz Luhrmann's incessant need to be overly colorful, poorly acted, and schticky in a passé manner overshadow anything resembling a story. This is one of Ewan MacGregor's worst performances, mostly because his singing isn't that great. Not his fault, I can't sing either. Nicole Kidman was pretty good, but again, she can be so much more than this. All of the actors in the film have done much better work, with the exception of Leguizamo's previous foray into Luhrmann's twisted little corner of lame, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (funny, I was IN a production of Romeo and Juliet, and I don't remember Shakespeare having Romeo take ecstasy or Juliet SHOOT HERSELF IN THE HEAD!) While the visual spectacle of the film may have been wildly colorful and flashy, no amount of set design and effects take away from the fact that the story was poorly told, and that many of the scenes seemed to have more to do with Luhrmann wanting a certain song to be in the film than any sort of continuity. I'd recommend anyone to stay away from this drivel, see Huston's film and you'll know what I mean.",Moulin Rouge!
1718,bjornstt,THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!!!!!!,1,4 July 2002,"Don't waste your money.  The idea was good, but it was way over the top! It is a waste of time and money and a lot of talent.  Ewan McGregor is one of the best actors out there right now and he is the only sanity in the film as the chaos in everything else surrounds him.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone except to see a great vision go awry!",Moulin Rouge!
1719,mfilter,"Sensory overload, but well worth it!",10,21 May 2002,"As a graphic designer, I found this movie appealing for it's intricate visual imagery and synthesis of old and new. Due to the bizarre marketing strategy used in the United States, I had no idea this movie was a musical until I entered the theatre, and I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. The dance sequences definitely lived up to my expectations from Luhrmann's previous work (namely Strictly Ballroom).The film isn't for everyone. Either you will love it or hate it, but I encourage people to view it with an open mind.",Moulin Rouge!
1720,fairly_freaksome,good movie :o),10,17 December 2002,"I think Moulin Rouge was an EXCELLENT movie, no matter what any of those Moulin Rouge haters say. I do admit I hated it the first time I saw it, but I was so bored one day that I watched it again, and I understood it! Since then I've seen it at least 30 times, and it is now my favourite movie :-) For those people bagging the lighting in this movie, I don't think you really understand why Baz used those colours. You will find that whenever Christian or Satine are sad, the lighting is blue, whenever one of the two is happy or optimistic or you can see that they are madly in love with each other, the lighting is white and/or red (these are also the French flag colours, he he he ;-)Any way, I think this is the kind of movie that you either absolutely love, or you absolutely hate, and the kind of movie you need to see twice to really understand... Ten out of ten from me :-)",Moulin Rouge!
1721,carolynharley,Brilliant,10,9 June 2002,"The most brilliant of movies I've seen in a long time and will probably stay forever top of my charts.  The musical arrangements were terrific.  It's a movie whose songs sends shivers down your arms.When I first started watching it I was dubious and thought I was going to be disappointed, but the music just grew on me.  Now I keep watching it over and over again and repeating my favourite parts.  Even my two sons of 13 are mad about it and watch it when I'm not around.Congratulations to everyone who was part of the making of the film.",Moulin Rouge!

Your be swept along in a bohemeian storm which one moment will have you howling with laughter, the next crying cascades! Has there been a sadder love store since Rik and Elsa.

1725,shmustic,Incredible Movie!,10,16 August 2002,"I refused to watch this movie for close to a year.  My husband finally talked me into renting it and I have to admit that I wasn't impressed with the first 15 minutes of the movie.  But I was soon glued to the television monitor. I fell in love with this movie! So much so, that I purchased it the very next day along with the soundtrack.  I was never a big fan of Nicole Kidman, until her magnificant performance in Moulin Rouge.  And as for Ewan McGregor - Wow!!!  I have since watched just about every movie he has been in and I must admit that he is a superb actor and quite handsome...  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  Just remember that the first 15 minutes may be a little unorthodox, but sit through it and you too will agree that this is a fantastic movie...",Moulin Rouge!
1726,lauren_33,fantastic,10,7 July 2002,"One of the greatest movies ever made. Every aspect of this film is brilliant.

Nearly a year since I was first over-awed by this masterpiece and I still love every SECOND of it! OK, so we all own the DVD now but if you ever get another chance to catch this pitch-perfect film on the big screen again then grab it, because you ain't seen anything until you've seen a twenty-foot Ewan McGregor belting out 'Your Song' over the rooftops of Paris.10/10, *****, whatever - this film is an absolute joy.",Moulin Rouge!

They announced that they had this really good movie that they had rented for us to see. Moulin Rouge was that movie. I have seen bad movie before, but I believe that this may have been as bad a movie as I have ever seen. It makes me seriously question the sanity of some critics that were highly praising this movie. It had no redeeming qualities at all!",Moulin Rouge!
1729,lholden2310,Beneath the Sensory Extravaganza there is More than Meets the Eye,10,22 July 2002,"Moulin Rouge, for me, is one of those unique films that cannot fully be appreciated until it is viewed for at least a second, and maybe a third time.  After my first encounter with Moulin Rouge I found myself making the usual comments:  Colorful, lively soundtrack, fine performances, but at times visually distracting and unnerving, but an overall good movie that I enjoyed.  But after a second viewing, I discovered so much, much more.Beneath the soundtrack, slick editing, elaborate costuming and eclectic sets is, at heart, a simplistic, emotional love story.  That the plot is simplistic and not terribly original cannot be denied.  However, like most great stories, it is this simplicity that allows the performers to carry the show, to utterly convince us that this story is important and worth telling. Plot complexity would merely distract from the emotional, sincere portrayals given by the cast.  It is the performances and director Baz Luhrman's willingness to capitalize on them rather than subjugate them to visual frenzy that transform Moulin Rouge from a fun song and dance number into poetic filmmaking.Ewan McGregor is perfect as the idealistic, hopeful romantic who woos the world (and Satine) with his song.  He is unafraid to expose himself as an actor emotionally and whimsically.  Jim Broadbent as Zidler is clever and witty with just enough bombast to make us like a character who at his core should not be very likable.  And Richard Roxburgh does a fine job in the end of turning what could have been a prototypical ""foppish bad guy"" into a more complicated villain with real pain of his own.  All the actors sing effectively (particularly Kidman and McGregor) and they use the songs not as an interruption to entertain us, but to further the story in an effective, emotional way.Ultimately, in this writer's humble opinion, it is Nicole Kidman who pushes the movie to the highest level.  Unfortunately, before this film, I was one of the many who perceived Kidman as a decent talent, but successful largely due to her husband's coattails.  I stand corrected.  In Moulin Rouge Kidman conveys more emotion with simply her eyes than most actresses can do with a hundred words.  What makes her performance extra special is the ability to tell the story without saying a word.  Kidman's character goes through changes, some subtle and not-so-subtle, that pushes the actress to great work.  In the Elephant Love Medley, if one can stop from rollicking along with the music (which admittedly is difficult to do)and observe Kidman's acting, it is a marvelous thing to behold.  She evolves through defiance, amusement, wonder, fear, doubt, hope and finally embraces Christian's love, and she does all this definitively and effectively in three and a half minutes.Kidman takes us through Satine's complicated journey throughout the movie. She is a woman yearning for what she has never known (true love), but certain that yearning will lead to destitution and heartbreak.  She dives in with Christian, only to realize, despite her anguish, that this love cannot succeed, it is just not meant to be.  Of course she comes to realize Christian is a man who loves her more than he loves what she can provide and do for him.  She is astounded by this and commits to him no matter what, until she realizes she is dying and cannot offer him anything.  It is painful to watch her fight with the idea and resolution of telling Christian she doesn't love him and must send him away.Beneath the flash and bang of Moulin Rouge exists the picture I just described, and if we let it, it will take us on an emotional ride with which we can relate, share and feel.  We really do feel for the characters and understand their love, sorrow, love and pain.  This is the Moulin Rouge I saw the second time around, and it has made all the difference.  I challenge others out there to give this movie the same chance.",Moulin Rouge!
1730,Lynangel17,My thoughts about this movie.,10,28 July 2002,I think this movie is the greatest movie of all time!This is my favorite movie in the world.I thik Baz Lurman did such a wonderful job on it and I think it was such wonderful costumes and designs of Paris.I especially love the music I thought Nicole Kidman had a really great voice and so did Ewan Mcgregor.,Moulin Rouge!
1731,Venus_101786,Absolutely Amazing,10,29 July 2002,"I absolutely love this movie! I have to admit that for the first twenty minutes or so, I was thinking to myself ""what in the heck is going on here?"" But I stayed to watch the whole thing and I can't tell you how glad I am that I did. Not only is the acting amazing, but the singing was out of this world! Who knew Nicole Kidman could sing like that (I sure couldn't, especially if I was hanging from a trapeze at the same time...) and I repeatedly listen to Ewan's songs (his voice just makes me fall in love with him). The story just rips your heart out (in the best possible way) and I think I've watched it so many times that I can pretty much talk along with the movie (I'm just a little bit of a movie geek...). Baz Luhrman did an incredible job with this movie and Catherine Martin's costumes were so gorgeous! The rest of the group (Harold, The Duke, Toulouse, etc.) make the movie so great that I hope everyone who watches it loves it just as much as I do!",Moulin Rouge!
1732,warGOD-nl,It simply stunned me...,10,30 July 2002,"This movie has everything.Music, Romance, perfect Cast, beautiful Locations, great Story... Everything!I watched it with both my former girlfriends and (we) cried both times.The official movie poster is in my room. I like it THAT much!If you saw it too - You know what I mean. If you didn't see it yet - What are you doing here? Go see it NOW!;-)",Moulin Rouge!
1733,cmroczek33,I love this beautiful movie....,10,16 March 2005,"Moulin Rouge is an incredible movie, truly ""Spectacular, Spectacular""! The scenery, lighting and costumes are unbelievably beautiful. Then there's the music.......amazing use of contemporary music in 1900 Paris! Nicole & Ewan's voices are wonnnnderful together. Did not know either of them could sing, but both of them have great voices and together they ARE breath-taking. The dance number is haunting - after watching the movie, I find myself singing ""why does my heart cry...."" for days! Also, ""Come What May"" runs through my mind often, too.Nicole is ""drop-dead"" beautiful as Satine. I have always admired her acting. I do believe she is one of the finest actresses there is - she IS ""Sarah Bernhart"" and then some. Not hard to imagine that Christian, the Duke and every other man for miles around would fall in love with her. I enjoyed her (their) humorous touches, too! Ewan, on the other hand, I hadn't much noticed before (I DO now!) He was lovable and adorable as Christian. Many of his facial expressions warmed my heart and/or broke it. He is a marvelous actor as well. He and Nicole are fantastic together - the perfect couple! In view of the ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" production, direction, acting, and music; I am puzzled that the movie was not even more successful in the USA. We are a real ""bohemian"" society and Love is a prevalent, dominant theme in movies, advertising, etc. I guess, in general, we have no taste for the finer things.... Suffice it to say, I absolutely loved it and will continue to watch it over and over.",Moulin Rouge!
1734,KTtheQT,No words to describe it,10,9 August 2002,"It's a little bit funny... this feeling inside... After watching Moulin Rouge, I did feel that way. It was weird, seeing such an amazing movie. It just has so much OOMPH in it. The actors and actresses look like they're enjoying themselves unlike in some movies where they have expressions on their faces like ""only 5 more months of filming... only 5 more months of filming""Basically, I loved this movie. I have seen it soo many times and have never gotten tired of it. It grows on me more and more. Except the only problem now is that I have to remember not to recite all the lines that I've memorized (the whole movie) and let the actors talk.Ewan... what can you say about him? He looks AMAZINGLY FANTASTIC in this movie. I just wish they would've showed more of him. Oh well.Nicole... great singer... great actress... Ewan and her are a perfect movie couple. (But hmm... they seem a little too close sometimes if you know what I mean)Can you imagine someone like Heath Ledger playing Christian? Or Catherine Zeta-Jones or Renee Zelwegger playing Satine? Crazy.Anyway, I give this movie a 10/10. Like Baz Luhrman originally said (but my way), its like a record that you can play over and over again and never get sick of. The graphics and effects are great, the costumes are unreal. Moulin Rouge is like a fairy tale that you just lose yourself in watching.",Moulin Rouge!
1735,lnd02,Worst anything ever made,5,13 August 2002,This movie was one of a kind in the fact that it was THE WORST movie I have ever seen. It was too fast paced which made it annoying and nerve-racking!!! I didn't know whether to press mute or change the channel. The second won. I never saw the end. Thirty minutes was enough for me. I kept waiting for it to get better. The ONLY thing that was good in this movie was the music (although the guy singing Like a Virgin was what made up my mind about the mute vs. channel changing controversy) In short is was THE worst musical ever made. EVER. If not the worst MOVIE ever made. PERIOD.,Moulin Rouge!
1736,Beach_Monkee,One of the greatest movies of all time...,10,15 August 2002,"Moulin Rouge is probably my favorite movie of all time.  How could it not be?  The Passion, the humor, the love, the plot, the music...  The Ewan McGregor?  ^_^  It may be a little strange at first, but the story brings you right in, and you just have to find out what happens!  This is a movie for those love to laugh, cry, and sing along. This movie is about a young English Writter, named Christian who comes to Paris in 1900 to write about what he believes in above all else...  Love. But what are you to to when you've never been in love?  Through a sequence of events, he is hired to write a new play called ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" for the Moulin Rouge, a night club that is about to turn into a theater. Christian meets Satine, the sexy star of the Moulin Rouge who has dreams of becoming a real actress.  When the two meet, it's almost love at first sight.  As they continue to be together and write the show, the ""Evil"" Duke, who wants Satine to himself, tries to have his own way, creating the problems. The music, even though it is not entirely original, is Awesome.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman hit every note perfect, and their voices blended quite well.  It's a must see for any true Child of the Revolution.  ~*Beach Monkee*~",Moulin Rouge!

The film direction and editing were superb and every single actor fulfilled his or her own unique role and made their character magical and memorable! There is so much to see in this movie that you can watch it a hundred times and see something new each time. This movie is full of heart, soul, and music! The imagination and creativity overflowed in every single scene. If only there could be a sequel...",Moulin Rouge!
1738,chivesthebutler,Favorite movie ever!!,10,1 May 2008,"I love the Moulin Rouge so much! Ewan and Nicole are great in the movie. You should totally see it. Ewan is a really good singer and is really funny. I like his theater friends in the movie, they are the funniest out of everyone. My top three favorite songs are- 1)Elephant Love Medley 2)come what may and 3)Roxanne. If you are a fan of romantic comedies or dramas you should see it. You should also see it if you enjoy Ewan Mcgregor or Nicole Kidman. They have great chemistry . It is sort of a sad movie though so if you don't like sad movies you may not want to watch it. Please, Please, Please, Please Please, Please watch it and comment on it. Bye! Watch the movie!!",Moulin Rouge!
1739,mmmoooooooo0,Moulin Rouge is a genius creation combining modern savvy and classical romance giving this one-of-a kind musical its diverse appeal. Plainly stated: SPECTACULAR SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,30 August 2002,"This has become my all time favorite movie from the start! The first five minutes leaves you hooked and bedazzled with the lively, colorful Bohemian antics. The modern music turned show tunes really helps you to relate to the story and gives this film its universal appeal.  A genius work from a genius mind, this movie can addict viewers. Soon you'll find yourself singing along too!  If you've got the least bit of a Bohemian spirit in you, you'll love this movie!!!! :)",Moulin Rouge!
1740,racheleastwood,Extremely enthusiastic,10,6 September 2002,"The first time I saw Moulin Rouge I really didn't know what to expect. A modern musical, using established songs for the sound track and Ewan and Nicole singing! I was blown away. I love Baz Luhrmans work anyway but I think he has excelled himself with this film. It is colourful, fun, vibrant and sad all at the same time. For me it has everything that a truely classic film should have and it is one which I can see over and over again without feeling that it has lost anything or grown tired with repeat watching.
Baz Luhrmans over the top style of direction and the sheer opulance of his set productions would make this film worth viewing on its own, but add to that the wonderful chemistry between the two leads and the brilliance that is Jim Broadbent, (Like a Virgin will never be the same again!), and you have a truely enjoyable experience.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both do a fantastic job with the kitsch music and they can truely sing. They are sexy, romantic and tragic by turn and carry off their roles perfectly.Any fans of Baz Luhrmans Strictly Ballroom or Romeo and Juliet will probably enjoy this film, especially if they like a good sing along followed by a good cry! I know that there are people out there who didn't enjoy this film, and I can understand that it isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I for one would rate this as my favourite film of the last few years and would urge anyone to watch it and make up their minds for themselves.",Moulin Rouge!
1741,Carnelian-Zebra-Lily,Luxuriant Visuals But A Sinisterly Arrogant and Putrid Empty AfterTaste,4,16 May 2008,"I think that Moulin Rouge is an optically lush film, the set designs and costumes were magnificent, however I found Nicole Kidmans panting, pretty performance as a dying prostitute with a heart all too familiar, all too clichéd and all too irritating. Looking back at Ewan Mcgregor I think that his performance was actually quite wooden, and by-god the portrayal of Henri Toulouse Lautrec as a homo-sexual, camp little clown was maniacal beyond belief! I hate the way Baz Lurhman and his friends have taken some of the 20th Centurys most influential songs such as Queens 'The show must go on', Nirvanas 'Smells like teen spirit' and many others and used them as kidnapped material devices to illustrate their characters self-indulgent, careless, quite frankly brat-like lifestyles of filthy sex, drugs and {the most sickening of all} their fetid idea of what Art is. At times, this was like watching a Kylie Minogue:The Movie. A kiwi ego-maniac drenched in feathers and jewels dancing around whilst playing a vintage actress/ sensitive showgirl was just so clichéd to me. Burlesque and all that stagy splendour is something we see so much of nowadays with girl bands and various other movies like Chicago. I look back at this film and think of it as a giant, sexed-up, arrogant music video with a vintage theme. It makes me feel rather sick and angry. Perhaps the most perplexing, mind-numbingly annoying thing about this film is that Lurhman obviously thinks he has achieved something completely out of the ordinary, and all of his 14+-teeny-bopper-bimbo-simple-minded audience has fallen for this frothy, foamy, glittery,red-curtain whirl of a pop-video movie. I think that Bazza and co made a considerable attempt at moving the audience, but in the end i just found their endeavours to be melodramatic, artificial and so very calculated. People are supposed to pity Satine because shes a whore who wants to 'fly away' from the Moulin Rouge. Why would she want to do that? At the Moulin Rouge, she is the complete star, dressed from head to toe in finery most 19th Century whores could only dream of, with her own private boudoir, luxuries and a host of men who will pay hundreds to spend time with her - furthermore, she gets to choose which of these men she sleeps with. What more could she possibly want? Freedom? She and her tacky 'bohemian' friends prove that they have all the freedom they need. In fact, they have so much freedom, they are dumbfounded by it, and don't know what to do with it other than take drugs, dance to orgasmic music and create ridiculous barriers for themselves so that they can weep into their red velvet curtains about how supposedly bleak and tormented their lives are. Apparently the inhabitants of the Moulin Rouge are 'creatures of the underworld who can't afford to love'. I have never heard such nonsense in all my life - considering the fact that such a teary-eyed, rosy-cheeked sob story is coming from a bunch of circus performers who spend the entire movie giggling, grinning and drowning in a blissful, decadent, non-stop party where there is an abundance of their definition of the word 'love' aka corseted sex or whimpering shining-eyed whims of 20th Century pop-song valentines day tag-lines. I couldn't find any philosophy, any depth, any art or anything original in this movie. The visuals were rather superb, especially the Hindi-Influenced ""Spectacular, Spectacular"", but the plot was bland and it was an infuriatingly patchwork montage of other peoples songs, musical work, operas and tragic story lines. The performances were very deliberate, thespian...almost as if the actors/actresses knew exactly how startled and boggle-eyed the more approving members of the audience would be. It was like watching a bunch of people who were in love with the idea of their own performances, and spent most of the movie flirting with their own images in the lens of the out of control cameras. Beauty, Freedom, Truth and Love are handsome things to have faith in, and I adore the romantic, unconventional history of the 1900s theatrical scene in Europe, and that is probably why this movie makes me so mad. I feel it has hijacked and raped history, 20th Century rock and roll, and the very elements of Parisian Art, and then dressed these things up to a sickly sweet Dame-Edna-Extremity. This film is an excuse for actors and actresses to have some fun dressing up in major flamboyant burlesque outfits and producing a soundtrack of their panto-party for all the world to witness. At the worst I found this to be an overpowering, alcoholic, destructive, emotionally-and-spiritually shallow joyride which makes nothing but attempts. As a final note, I really expected The so-called 'bohemians' {or should i say in their case 'bwo-hwemi-ans'} to see something out-of-the-ordinary and inspiring once they drunk the famous poet-pushing-dream-inducing liquor Absinthe...but instead, all they saw was Kylie in another one of her Dolce&Gabbanna-John-Galliano-Encrusted-Twinkling-Show-girl costumes singing an Andrew Lloyd Webber number. Good Grief, how useless is absinthe? What does one have to drink in order to see something REALLY inspiring?",Moulin Rouge!
1742,Joya-the_one,Simply the best movie ever!!!,10,1 October 2002,"Saw it 3 times in the cinema, and i cried every time... The music makes you wanna sing along with the actors. So find the true bohemian in yourself (if you believe in beauty, freedom and love) and go get this absolute great movie! ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return""",Moulin Rouge!
1743,eclaire0270,The Best Movie In The World,10,14 December 2002,"What is there to say about Moulin Rouge? Well, I could start by saying that, Baz does it right again! Part of Baz's talent is the fact that he can take some of the weirdest subjects in the world and make them into wonderful movies. WONDERFUL movies.Now I know that some critics did not like Moulin Rouge, or Romeo+Juliet, or Strictly Ballroom, but those are movies that you need to see twice before you like them. By the second time, the initial shock is gone.I'll admit, the first time I saw Moulin Rouge; I skipped right to the end when I heard Ewan McGregor say (in the first five minutes) that the woman he loved was dead. The second time I saw it, I watched the entire thing and was blown away. By the third time, I was hooked.Nicole Kidman, who I had never seen in a movie before this, has a wonderful voice, and I think that this movie, a fun, romantic, hilarious movie, must've been good for her considering her recent divorce from Tom Cruise. Her voice blow you away first during `Sparkling Diamonds' and then again during her solo `One Day I'll Fly Away' Though her death scene went on just a bit too long, her performance in this movie was astounding, and thank God the people at MTV have more sense than the Academy, considering she won the MTV Movie Award for Best Actress.Ewan McGregor, Good Lord Ewan McGregor. I had seen him in Star Wars before this, but I had never really known the depth of his acting. Once I saw Moulin Rouge, I was in love. Seriously. For a month, I seriously considered marrying him. That is, until I realized he was already married (that's always the catch isn't it?). I got over that though and I am currently on a mission to see every movie he's been in. Ewan, who really, really, looks good in this movie, can sing better than some of the hot stars now *cough-boy bands-cough-cough-rappers-cough*, makes me want to automatically skip to the `Your Song' scene, just so I can hear his solo.Speaking of, the music of this movie is so.out of this world that, at first glance, it's hard to even realize what it is. Suddenly, Dolly Parton and Elton John are being mixed. Old men in tuxedos are singing Nirvana's `Smells Like Teen Spirit'. Then Zidler and the Duke are singing `Like A Virgin' as though it's a Broadway number. And the mix is perfect. Don't even try messing with it.The best song is `Tango de Roxanne' which is a remake of the Sting song. No offense to Sting, but his version-well-sucked. This version is a mix of a tango and the original song. It starts out with the Narcoleptic Argentinean telling Christian `Never fall in love with a woman who sells herself, it always ends BAD!' Then, he proceeds to sing the song, a haunting rendition, with thirty couples in the background doing the same steps. It truly is the perfect piece to go with the scene which is when *SPOILERS SPOILERS* the Duke realizes that Christian and Satine are in love and tries to rape her. Dark music for a dark scene. Take that people who said that they thought the movie was pointless!If you are a person who never watches a whole movie after twenty minutes, claiming that you disliked the first bit and the rest should be just as bad, stick with Moulin Rouge. Many think that the beginning was stupid and funny, and that the movie must have no worth. The first thirty minutes or so are funny, and needed, so just wait awhile for the seriousness to kick in.And it does get serious. When Christian and Satine are in love, they have to hide that from the overly jealous Duke. Satine has Consumption, and the only cure for that in 1899 was prayer. She had violent coughing fits that left her unconscious and spitting up blood. And the Duke has a violent, possessive temper that results him in ordering his manservant Warner to kill Christian.So it's not a happy movie. But it is. Ewan and Nicole have such great chemistry together that, when she dies you start yelling at the TV-if you have the strength, this death scene will make you cry for ten minutes straight-, `That's not the way it's supposed to end! Satine's supposed to become a great actress, and Christian is supposed to be a great author, and you're supposed to get married and have kids and be happy!' But maybe that's just me. When the two sing, it's like forget the outside world, these two are just too good together.So, go rent Moulin Rouge. It will be the best movie you've seen. I swear to you that it is.",Moulin Rouge!
1744,kerry-at-randomworld,Inventive! Beautiful Story line,7,12 August 2008,"I must say the extravagance of the movie at the beginning was quite hard to follow, and seemed slightly too eccentric, but then again that's Moulin Rogue in a nutshell. However I did think the usage of Madonnas ""like a virgin"" and songs like ""love lift us up where we belong"" made it slightly ""cheesy"". The beauty of the script was undeniable, the huge theme of love throughout the play almost had me in tears at it's beauty. I loved seeing the character of Satine (Nicole Kidman) evolve from and excellent manipulator of men into someone who truly awakens to love. Fantastic performances from all the cast. It really felt like someone had sat you in the most extravagant show that the world could possibly offer.",Moulin Rouge!
1745,hamm-5,A must see!,10,9 October 2002,"Excellent movie, well worth the time.  I am not a musical type, actually I hate them, but this movie grabbed my attention and kept it through out. Very well done.  Kidman was great.  A must see, (at least once)!",Moulin Rouge!
1746,nayoaoun,The movie i could watch everyday! for the rest of my life,10,15 October 2002,"I personally think that A Beautiful Mind is a wonderful movie. But what i can't understand is how it won best picture at the Academy Award's over Moulin Rouge and how Baz Lurhmann wasn't nominated. I have watched Moulin Rouge so many times i can't even remember. But this is because every time i see this movie i love it even more! Every detail is perfect, the art direction, the costumes, the colors, the way it was directed, the music!!, the actor's performances!!!!!!, everything! it is such an original movie, i think that if we gave the script to any one but Baz Lurhmann, it could never be as it is. Every scene is wonderful in it's own way that we could repeat it and sing and love it so much! How new to old songs were put together .How every scene can move so fast and be so slow. The movement, the choreography. From the beautiful funny scenes to the dramatic ones. I just have so many things to say, but words are never enough. It just deserved to win...",Moulin Rouge!
1747,kenmf,Two Thumbs Up,8,10 September 2008,"Having watched Moulin Rouge a few times it has begun to grow on me in a good way, I have no idea why but I have a thing for musicals at the moment staring actors who don't usually sing, for example Moulin Rouge (Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman) and Mamma Mia (Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth) I think it may be because its funny listening to them sing when they are not natural musicians or I could like it because its something different to what you hear in the charts today which is probably the reason why I have grown attached to these films. One thing I didn't mention at the start was that the singing and acting from the two main roles of Nicole and Ewan went together perfectly, especially in the ""Elephant Medley"" scene their voices merged together beautifully with the addition of some great 20th century classics like ""your song"" by Elton John and ""I will always love you"" by Whitney Houston. They turned these classics into great new songs by doing mixing them together along with other great songs from the 20th century. This film is a superb example of musical film in the form of a tragic love story where the penniless Writer ""Christian"" (McGregor) is deprived of his (burlesque dancer) secret lover ""Satine"" (Kidman) right at the end of the film just when they thought they were about to live happily ever after. It is enough to bring a tear to the eyes of some however I did not. Overall I think Baz Luhrmann has exceeded himself as a director with this film and I believe it will go on to be a musical classic.",Moulin Rouge!
1748,jemma_bright,i love it!,9,3 October 2008,"This film is incredible. The actors, shots, script, music, everything. There isn't anyone who could of played Satine and Christian better than Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I absolutely loved it. And because of it, i completely fell for Ewan McGregor! His character was adorable, and being able to sing that well just made him more irresistible! Nicole Kidman looked flawless throughout the entire movie and played her role to perfection. I thought the way they managed to make modern songs fit in so well in a film set in the 1900s was brilliant, and every lyric fit perfectly. El tango De Roxanne, the elephant love medley and come what may have got to be my favourite songs. the passion and emotions through el tango De Roxanne just sends shivers right through me, it was filmed amazingly. the facial expressions of the Argentinian, Nini and Christian tell a story in themselves. My favourite character has got to be Toulouse though. Even though Christian is gorgeous and Satine was amazing, Toulouse still managed to become my favourite! His accent, enthusiasm, and overall look was just brilliantly put together. One of the best films i have ever seen !",Moulin Rouge!
1749,jennifer-pinkgnome,Mouin Rouge! The Greatest Thing You'll Ever Know......,10,21 November 2008,"Moulin Rouge is possibly the best movie I have seen. It includes great acting, musical genius, and insanely good camera work. The bittersweet love story will touch the soul, while the comic relief will make you laugh until you cry. Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christian), flourish in their acting roles. You can feel their pain and happiness accentuated by their talent-filled singing voices. You cannot forget the supporting cast for they are equally as excellent. Jim Broadbent (Harold Zidlar) and John Leguizamo (Toulouse-Lautrec) shine in their comic filled roles. The vivid camera work makes you feel like you're at the Moulin Rouge in 20th century France. The music combines well known songs like ""Like a Virgin"" by Madonna and ""Your Song"" by Elton John. All and all this movie delivers in a comedic-musical-love story that is what every person craves in a movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1750,daisychui,I love this movie!,10,15 November 2002,"I had the privelege of watching the movie premiere in Hong Kong.  Baz Luhrmann, director, also attended to kick off the movie.  After a can-can dance, there were some technical difficulties in which the movie would not play.  As i was eager to watch the film, after reading rave critics on the movie, I became worried that i might've gone for nothing.  yet it was during this time when Baz came out and talked to us about the production of the film, funny things that happened, etc.  luckily, the film worked, and i was in for an amazing journey which i will not forget. the music, the story, the colour, the mise en scene, the background setting, the dancing, the editing- the film was beautifully filmed, directed and edited to lead the audience into a spectacular journey.  the acting and singing was simpling enthralling, and because of this i have become a fan of both ewan mcgregor and nicole kidman.  Kidman should've won the oscar for her role in moulin rouge, and Mcgregor at least a nomination. nevertheless, i was most surprised and angered to hear Baz was not nominated for best director.  How could he not be for such a wonderful film? For those who have not seen the film, go rent it now.  you'll be mesmerised by the magic.  i give the movie the fullest 10 out of 10 there can be.",Moulin Rouge!

1752,pibbynjellytime,"Wonderful, thought provoking, risk taking movie!",10,19 February 2009,"*CONTAIINS SPOILERS!!!!* I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Moulin Rouge took many risks from their medley of classic songs from the 20th century to their beautiful, unusual story of true love. You know how some people say that they laughed, they cried at the end of a great movie? I did all of these and more. I was breathless during most of the musical numbers. The first time that Christian and Satine were in Elephant Room, I laughed so hard I'm pretty sure i started to cry. Once Satine died and Christian began to cry, tears began to build up and I couldn't help but crying right along with them. This movie was beautiful and it is one that I will cherish for the rest of my life.",Moulin Rouge!

One of the few masterpieces of this new era of films (1995 onward), Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! has captivated my soul. It is the only film that has evoked every possible emotion out of me. For those who haven't seen the film, please note that there may be some things spoiled in the next few sentences.I laughed with the bohemians, was smitten and totally in love with Christians and Satine, felt the burning rage and jealousy of Christian as his love was toyed with, was as genuinely torn apart as Satine as she balanced true love with her career, and admittedly cried when Satine died, leaving Christian to bear it all.I strongly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. In it's lavishness is the pure and unadulterated love story that will surely leave you spellbound and breathless when leaving the theatre.",Moulin Rouge!

1755,BlueWill,Its's a movie than starts fresh but just ends in a recycled mess.,7,17 June 2003,"When one first starts watching Moulin Rouge it is easy like the characters of the movie to get swept away in its eye popping visual flair.  The Costume, and Art department get a big 2 thumbs up for the work they did on this piece.  And the some of the musical sequences were phenominal (i.e. Loved the Can-Can; and both versions of ""Diamonds are a Girls best friend"", as well as ""Roxanne"" looked amazing).  But other than that i feel that Moulin Rouge had nothing else to offer but a very bad, way over-dramatic storyline.  Its a Movie that starts Fresh but just ends in a recycled mess and for the most part everything just came off very cheesy.  I think what i really didn't like about it is that it seems like an original piece of work but its not.  I hated how most of the songs weren't original but remakes or re-vamped versions of pop hits.  Throwing a whole bunch of songs together to make one love song just seemed cheesy to me and silly.  In fact thats another good adjective for this movie silly, and too erratic.  It kinda felt i was on drugs for most of the film; some wild stimulant for the first 30 minutes  and then on some depressants for the second half.  Though i couldn't feel anything for any of the characters.  I really didn't care if the lovers ended up together at the end, because they had to force this love story down your throat till there was no room for air much less anything else.  By the end I was just exhausted of hearing everyone moan and cry. Performances over-all were good but I think Ewan Mcgregor shines brighter than Nicole Kidman does.  His wide-eyed enthusiam for art and love was addicting at times, but Nicole seemed to jump from stale to over the top too many times (her performances in The Others and The Hours are better examples of her acting abilitites).  Everyone else just seemed (again) silly.  Moulin Rouge is not a terrible movie.  Its almost worth it to own a copy just to look at the dazzling decor of the film.  But having to hear 200 songs about love isn't worth it to me.",Moulin Rouge!
1756,aprklass_10,Greatest Romance film of all time,10,2 January 2004,"Moulin Rouge is the best Romance film I've ever seen.  After watching it, it inspires you to go out and fall in love but it has its drawbacks.  It can either turned your whole life to be devoted to finding that special someone or to be careful about fallling in love (Satine's passing) The music and emotional colours bring a lot of emotion to the film.",Moulin Rouge!
1757,chrysaliteman,A non-traditional film about traditional idealism,10,21 January 2003,"Baz Luhrmann has perfected one of the ADD generation's greatest feats: keep the attention of your audience while not sacrificing plot or character development.  The suspension of disbelief that Baz so quickly threw out is not necessary to make us care about his characters, Satine and Christian. He doesn't cop out with a la-dee-da story, where all the characters live happily ever after.  We find this out from the get-go when Christian introduces us to the story.  At the same time, he doesn't make us think we're seeing a happy story only to surprise us at the end with a tragic surprise (this is also accomplished by Christian's introduction).  In short, Baz created a film the only way it can be effectively created: in a way that is both traditional and non-traditional, in that it matches more the Greek tragedy than the Hollywood blockbuster, while at the same time boasting a musical score that includes everything from Fatboy Slim to Elton John to Nirvana.  He has a lot of story to cover in a short period of time, and he performs wonderfully.",Moulin Rouge!

If you want to pick an absolutely ORIGINAL, its impossible. Everything must come from somewhere. I felt the director is very clever to choose such an old familiar story and twist it so the element of surprise will be greater. The camera work is stunning. I never like MTV stuffs to be clear. But come on! This better than MTV. The camera work is fast just to show the frantic environment of Moulin Rogue. This is my first time compel to post comment because I feel a lot of the reviewer here doesn't do this film justice. It is one of the best movie. I swear!

1760,emandal_maggs,The most original and groundbreaking movie of recent history,10,3 February 2003,"I have seen Moulin Rouge at least 25 times.  I think it is the most extraordinary movie of my generation and breaks every limit set by the industry.  I have heard all the traditional complaints...people didn't like the music, the editing was too swift, or it wasn't ""their taste"".  Moulin Rouge took a risk.  A risk films like A Beautiful Mind and Shakespeare in Love don't.  It risked by being controversial.  To make a likeable movie isn't hard, follow the Hollywood mold and stick in a few attractive actors, some bland dialogue and viola you have a film.  Moulin Rouge was made knowing that not everyone would like it, but knowing everyone would at least appreciate it for its artistic ingenuity.  Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story.  The editing in the Roxanne scene rushes through your body and is the most incredible of any movie in history.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are the most passionate on-screen couple; entirely convincing as their voices meld them together into one.  Never has a movie done what Moulin Rouge did.  It realized that the world of film is only being represented in one small way, whereas Moulin Rouge uses a camera and screen to make something bigger and more extraordinary than has ever been made before.  It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless.",Moulin Rouge!
1761,Snaddrik,"Really, really boring.",1,28 March 2003,"A had great expectations when I rented this movie, having just seen Chicago. I am also a rather big fan of musicals, thoug mostly the Broadway-style, which is often a bit different tha movie-style. Anyway, I sat down with a friend to whatch this. And about an hour into the movie we turned it of. Why? Because it was really, really boring. Let's go through this one fault at a time, and keep in mind that I didn't whatch all of it, so if it turns brilliant after an hour or so, please accept my apologies:The singing. Meaning the voices and performances of the actors. Not really too bad. But still, someone who could really sing would have been better. It is after all a musical.The music. Dreadful. Sure, in theory it seems like a good idea to take many different, but good songs, take a bit of this and a bit of that, and give it all the same sound, more or less. But it is just terrible. No song they sing can ever rise above the fact that you have heard it better elsewhere. Not only that, much of the music doesn't fit in, and the whole score is rather weak.The plot. I really do believe that I could have written a better one myself. There are no surprises, and it is in no way original. This is the greatest dissapointment in the film, that the plot is so transparrent. If you like it because it is a tragic lovestory, there are so many better films out there. Someone compared this movie to west side story. Not a too original plot there either, but the mood and music, not to say the dancing, is completely in another league.The editing. A bit more personal opinion here; I just didn't like it. Too many scenes were chaotic.I believe that was all. I gave this movie a 1, maby a bit prejudiced by the fact that so many gave it a good rating. I hate it when people admire that which should not be admired. Both me and my friend are interested in films, and have through this developed the sort of expertise that all reviewers here claim to have. This is not a macho-attack on a chick-flick, it is a reflected review of a really boring film.",Moulin Rouge!
1762,chunkst,see this movie,10,21 February 2003,"I'm not a musical person never really got into them..so when i saw that Moulin Rouge was coming out i wasn't pushed to go see it at first. Until my friends raved about it and said how different it was from normal musicals. I love music and they said i would love this movie seeing that they used more modern music in the songs. So i thought lets give it a try..long story short it is now my favorite movie. It blew me away, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, I laughed, I cried when Christian cried, and I wanted to sing along. The music was wonderful I loved how they took modern music by Elton John and turned it into this wonderful love ballad..even though it was already. I cried when i heard Come What May, it was the most romantic love ballad i have ever heard. And Ewan McGregor's voice out shines his GOOD looks..he is beautiful.

The concept is original and sweet with this romance between Satine and Christian. The interaction between these two reminds me a lot of mine and my boyfriend's. Because their love was so passionate and real. The actors did a bang up job. I like how it looked a bit cartoony due to them moving and dancing in a faster speed. Since Ewan Mcgregor is one of my favorite actors, I enjoyed it even more. Them using some of the sweet original songs and singing them in their own creative way was impressive.I'm definitely giving it a 10 out of 10 :)",Moulin Rouge!

Baz Luhrman did a wonderful job.  The camera is fast paced during most of the movie, so it takes many viewings to catch everything there is to see.  And of course the acting is great.  I never get tired of watching this movie. Everybody should see this movie and be open minded about it.  You don't have to like it, but you definitely need to see it!",Moulin Rouge!
1767,Tristo27,Refreshing and Oustanding Movie,10,13 February 2010,"I've watched this movie several times now, the first time being several years ago. I just saw it again and was reminded of how fantastic it is. If I recall, the first time I saw it I wasn't sold for the first part of the movie because of how different it is but by the time it was over I was very moved and simply loved the movie. On every re-watch of the film I'm moved all over again. The acting of the entire cast is very good and both McGregor and Kidman are outstanding in their acting and vocal performances. I still can't believe how incredible McGregor's voice is... In my opinion his voice has a very unique and outstanding quality that really stood out. Great film!",Moulin Rouge!
1768,dianae3,a very personal view,10,13 March 2003,"My boyfriend thought it was a bit over the top - we watched the DVD on Valentine's day and he obviously would have preferred something more peaceful. I've read similar criticisms of it. I tend to zoom in on the intimate scenes so the more flamboyant bits melt into the background. I thought musically it was excellent - my favourite scene is where the Argentinian sings Roxanne and Ewan MacGregor comes in with his own song - the counterpart is stunning. Also I had never noticed Ewan before in Brassed Off or Emma so the director really brought out his talent as a singer and got some very good visual shots too - they must both have worked very hard. I realy enjoyed the finale after the credits come up - all very romantic and stirring.  I wanted to know more about the history of the Moulin Rouge after this, having seen a black and white movie on TV when I was a child.  The film defintely inspired me to want more background information, about Paris in the 1890s and Toulouse Lautrec, and perhaps more about Argentina.",Moulin Rouge!

1772,bunkagirl101,i think this is a great movie,10,27 August 2010,"I really liked Moulin Rouge because it was a musical, drama, romance, comedy, and everything in between. It made me laugh, cry, and sing and I liked that. I enjoyed the variety of cast members and thought they played their characters very well; Nicole Kidman is one of my favorite actresses and Ewan McGregor is pretty cute so that may also be why I'm partial to this movie. What I didn't like about this movie was the ending, but I suppose that a ""happily ever after"" would've been cliché.A Walk to Remember shares many things in common with Moulin Rouge, but they also have differences. They both share sad endings and are love stories. However, Moulin Rouge has more genres entwined within the story than A Walk to Remember does.",Moulin Rouge!

1774,carl_behr,Unwatchable,5,18 February 2005,"I've tried to watch this film three times and can't make it past about forty-five minutes. The frenetic pace, outrageous costumes and bizarre use of music make it impossible to focus on anything. As near as I can tell, it is a rip-off of La Boheme with no music worth listening to combined with some of the people from the ""real"" Moulin Rouge. While I like Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent and Ewan McGregor, their roles here are just cartoon characters. The Leguizamo character is impossible to understand and easy to forget. Overall, I'd say Moulin Rouge is much like a ""Xanadu"" remake without any disco or roller skates. Perhaps one needs to be drunk to really enjoy the movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1775,yedjaboat,Ten times better than Chicago!!!,10,31 May 2003,"I can't believe the fuss this year about Chicago when Moulin  Rouge was so much more inventive and exciting. There was really only one good song in Chicago, All that Jazz, and I was disappointed that they didn't repeat it at the end!  What a waste. The other songs were so-so.  But Moulin Rouge just exploded.  The cast was magnificent.  I think I have seen this about five times on cable and I still enjoy it.",Moulin Rouge!
1776,oboe-1,I could feel my IQ dropping,3,31 May 2003,"To the film's credit, The musical medleys are inventive and well produced, even if the songs used have been played to exhaustion already (except for the aptly used ""Children of the Revolution"" by T-Rex--really rockin' song right there!).  However, the story and sexual innuendos which drive the story were about as inventive as another ""yo momma"" joke.
All of the cabaret scenes were sensational, which is cool, but I couldn't help but feel like they were only there to keep your attention from wandering away from the love story you've probably seen the likes of in a dozen other movies already.
To top it all off, I couldn't stand how all the male characters in this movie threw Satine around like a bargaining chip.  I know that's turn-of the century-Paris-reality, but I wish it hadn't been so glamourised.  It'd have been nice to see more of that Revolution the ""bohemian"" characters were so jacked up about.",Moulin Rouge!

I know musik, and I completely adored it! I know about theatre too and this didn't make it worse either. This is a film different from most other.

1779,D_Kozma,"Overkill of lights, fast cameras and tasteless music",1,8 July 2003,"First of all; I love music. Music isn't just a hobby for me, its a passion. Moulin Rouge is the single most terrible musical experience I've had. And yes, I enjoy most different types of quality music. The music of MR has been praised as innovative and exciting, but I have to disagree. The songs have been chosen by only one criteria; to be as easy for the audience as possible. It seems that any interesting songs, if there was any, have been dismissed in the pre-production stage in fear of losing audience. There was not one single song that would've surprised me in the movie. And yes, changing the words so they are aligned with the plot is one of the oldest tricks in the book. The fact that Moulin Rouge has been compared to some of the real musicals of our era is sickening. At least they tried to compose something new for the audience before...The plot was 90% predictable. The last 10% is made out of the scenes, which reach even deeper into the syrup than I thought was humanly possible. And when the music/dancing scenes were not powerful enough, hey, it's not a problem. By the rules of Moulin Rouge, there isn't a problem that couldn't be fixed by adding another 10 million light bulbs and flashlights, 50 extra dancers and perhaps a modulation in the song. Sorry, doesn't fix it for me.
Third of all, Nicole Kidman is beautiful, but in my opinion she really wasn't convincing as the beauty queen of Moulin Rouge.
All in all, except for the overkill of lights, fast cameras and tasteless music, Moulin Rouge didn't show anything we hadn't seen (as better versions) before. This movie surely was an unique experience for me, and I don't want to have that experience again...ever.",Moulin Rouge!
1780,princesswriter,Moulin Rouge captures the essence of love,10,16 July 2003,"'Moulin Rouge' illustrates that one of the most important things in life is to love and be loved.  The movie is about a young man, Christian (Ewan McGregor) who travels to Paris to write about love.  Soon there after, he meets the beautiful courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman).  In a very Romeo and Juliet-like moment, they fall in love, but are pulled apart by outside forces.  Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), owner of the 'Moulin Rouge', tells Satine to make the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) believe she loves him so he'll invest in the 'Moulin Rouge'.  She tries to play both sides, but of course it catches up to her and she's forced to make a choice.  'Moulin Rouge' is directed and co-written by Baz Luhrmann ('Romeo + Juliet') and he does anything but hold back on his creative style of filmmaking.In any movie, color plays a role in how a movie is detailed.  In 'Moulin Rouge' certain colors stand out and seem to play their own part in the movie.  The color red traditionally symbolizes love and death.  The use of the color in this film is emphasizing the search of love for both Christian and Satine.  It also foreshadows the inevitable death of Satine.  Red is the first color the audience sees, when the curtain rises, and also the last color the audience sees, when the curtain closes.  Throughout the movie, red is used elaborately in costumes and setting.  The décor in both the elephant dressing room and the Moulin Rouge is mostly red and the majority of the costumes are red or red tone.  Even the title, when translated, means red windmill.Probably the strongest thematic element would be the music.  'Moulin Rouge' is a musical, telling the story through music and dialogue.  The use of music is unique in that only one song (`Come What May') is an original song specifically for 'Moulin Rouge'.  Songs such as `Your Song', the various songs from `The Elephant Medley', `Come What May', and `Roxanne' all reflect the theme of love.There are many movies that try to capture the essence of love.  Some succeed, some fail.  'Moulin Rouge' has definitely succeeded.  Throughout the movie, the bohemian's belief in truth, freedom, beauty, and love is echoed constantly from the beginning with Christian to the bohemians reciting the line in a song at the end.  As they say in the movie, the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.",Moulin Rouge!
1781,Skyller,I never knew I could feel like this...,10,18 July 2003,"I never knew I could feel like this...

1783,Egle_Aliukeviciute,Quite original movie,10,24 May 2014,"Well, at first I can say that I expected a little bit different movie. But this took my breath away. It is a story about beautiful, all bridging love. The main actors were extremely good, they act pure love and I believe in them. But there was one negative thing. The knowing that Satine will die in the end. It took control of my mind and I could not empathize to characters' love, because every time then the things went a little bit wrong I expected Satine's tragic die. Nonetheless, the film was a truly original. It was fun to recognize really popular songs like ""Your song"", ""Show must go on"" and others. Some people can be a little angry, because they so loved songs were adopted to cabaret style music, but this is the main reason why this movie shows so interesting and different from other movies. Also, the mix of show and real characters' life took a huge enough part of this movie's exclusivity. I some words, I give 10 to this movie, because of inspiring love story and originals decisions.",Moulin Rouge!

1786,beatgrrl2000,Glitz Over Substance,4,8 December 2003,"As a ""theatre geek"", I was awfully disappointed with this film.  Yet again, Baz Luhrmann's cinematography takes center stage, his fast-paced camera movements and bright flashy set design overshadowing his characters and story.First, I must say I've never been a big fan of Baz.  In my mind, his masterpiece was ""Strictly Ballroom"".  There was a balance between visuals and story that made it a truly great movie.  Then came ""R+J"".  Shakespeare for the MTV teenage-set.  While I admired the idea, I held no love for the finished product.And the same could be said here.  ""Moulin Rouge!"" is nothing more than a splashy, musical rendition of ""The Lady of the Camillias"".  Most tragic is that while I adore Ewan and Nicole, I can't help but notice their lack of singing talent.  And the same could be said for every other actor involved. However, I am relieved that the musical numbers consisted of shallow pop tunes.  If I had to listen to Nicole Kidman attempt to sing the music of Porter, Kander & Ebb, or Sondheim, I'd be deaf.For the sake of the ""Movie Musical"", I wanted this film to succeed. However, I was left feeling nothing but pity for the genre.  So much so that I was prepared to loathe ""Chicago"" (definitely my favorite stage show) and was wonderfully surprised.I really admire Luhrmann's attempt, however I think he's better off sticking to original material.  If you want to see a great musical, watch ""Singin' in the Rain"" (essential) or ""Cabaret"".  And if you enjoy the story of ""Moulin Rouge!"", watch ""Camille"".  No one can beat Greta Garbo.",Moulin Rouge!
1787,NumeroUnoJoshFan,The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return!!,10,18 January 2004,"Moulin Rouge is one of my favorite movies of all time, honestly.  It has a beautiful love story and is wonderful in every aspect.  Luhrmann's work was fantastic, the colors and the way that he used recent pop music in a story that took place at the turn of the century was awesome. Also, I fell in love with Ewan McGregor in that movie.  His acting as Christian and his love for Satine was completely believable. But, a lot of the credit also has to go out for Nicole Kidman who without the movie would probably not have been as good.  As I previously mentioned, I loved the music and I thought that McGregor and Kidman did an absolute marvelous job singing them. I must admit though, that my favorite song is El Tango De Roxanne sung by 'The Unconscious Argentinean' (Jacek Koman). The only flaw that affected me in Moulin Rouge was the fact that Satine has consumption, or tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a highly contagious disease and the fact that Christian was kissing her as she died and was still alive one year later bothered me a bit. On a whole though, I have to recommend this movie to everyone.  If you're not a fan of love storys I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy the music and the color schemes! All in all .. I love it and I suggest that you go rent it/buy it today!",Moulin Rouge!
1788,jisozaki,load of crap,1,26 June 2008,"I don't comment on movies very often but after seeing that this movie rated a 7.7, I just had to put in my comments to get the rating more in line with reality.This movie was really a load of crap. Luckily, I did not see this in the theaters. Luckily (or unluckily) I borrowed a copy of the DVD so I wasn't out the rental price either but I did lose 2 hours of my life watching this awful mess.Having 2 stars singing is not enough to call it entertainment. Granted, they sang in tune but singing is more than just signing the right notes at the right time, much more and Nicole and Ewan gave us MUCH less.Even visually, this movie was off. Scenes were just too busy to be esthetically pleasing.",Moulin Rouge!

The cast is loaded with spectacular star power and Baz Lurhman is one of the most talented directors ever.  The movie can be described in one word ""Weird"".But that is what makes it soo amazing!  It is different than all the other films we have in society today.  It also is a movie for people who really treasure every form of art, because it contains every kind. The Music is modern as well as the dance.  The costumes and set decoration are truly exquisite!And I would reccomend this film to anyone who loves art and craves for something different! P.S.

1790,freshjiven,Not more than life could this say more of what i see of life,10,4 December 2004,"It's beautiful and real in its dramatic way. Although, it's unrealisticly told in a musical and in an unrealistic fantasy, it makes you love it with its thrill of hoping it could be real. Who could fall in love with a woman who lies to all the men she is with, but a pure hearted man who sees nothing else, the blinding effect of love. It makes you wanna believe in love and mankind. Forget everything you see in the news, but Moulin Rouge, a 2 hour tranquility of hope and love, is all you need. Maybe, it's that wish that we all could live in that world full of revolutionists who strive for our peace, but this movie has made me happy. It's full of hope and youth. I love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1791,moulinrougeinnocence,Words cannot describe this movie!,10,20 November 2003,"This is probably one of the most difficult films I'll ever review because it is so amazingly spectacular! The work Baz put into this film is absolutely amazing and the result is something we've never seen or felt before. Through song and music, he is able to express our most basic yet essential emotions in ways words can't describe. The emotions expressed in the film are so beautiful and connecting to every one of us - it takes us to a place we've always had in our hearts and feel happiest at, but it's also a place we rarely ever get to experience in everyday life. Moulin Rouge fufills our desires and makes us realize there's more to people than just what we see. In a world so chaotic and violent as today, I look at this movie as almost essential to bringing us back to what matters most - love. Moulin Rouge most definitely takes us to the beauty 'love' and allows to fill the void we so often have trouble expressing. If you do want to be touched in a simple yet most beautiful way, please watch this movie and let your heart soar!",Moulin Rouge!
1792,camacho-mel,"An extraordinary, spectacular musical!",10,30 November 2011,"Moulin Rouge (2011), directed by Baz Luhrmann is an extraordinary musical that takes stunning and daring risks with actors, song choice, costuming, choreography and plot. It is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, musicals I've ever watched in the sense that the execution of the story is both breathtaking and entertaining. Luhrmann chose to use actors like Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor as his star roles which made his choice of actors seemed quite daring at the time to the public. However, the highly talented and capable duo made the film's zest far more alluring and impressive. Luhrmann's use of type casting also helped to make the plot far more realistic to viewers.The best thing that comes out of ""Moulin Rouge!"" is definitely it's music and performances. The plot allows the movie to continue rolling along, however it's soundtrack allows the audience to feel the immense excitement and enthusiasm radiating from the screen. The performances are powerful and intensifying. Aside from excitement, the movie creates a feel of fantasy, love and aspirations while still reflecting reality. The musicality of the performances were intensified by it's highly decorated sets and costuming. There are bursts of color and light highlighted in every scene, that emanate specific emotions to be felt among the audience.The film is a great example of dramatic love, that reflects some of the concepts produced by films like ""Romeo and Juliet"". It's Bohemiam and burlesque-like twist emphasizes the overall sexiness and passionate love from the characters and allows the viewers to be totally immersed into the musical. ""Moulin Rouge!"" is an experience that is surely a shame to miss out on!",Moulin Rouge!

1794,absolutely_morvellous,"love lifts us up, all you need is love",10,4 February 2004,"I was one of those people that didn't see the movie at the cinemas, instead I waited for a friend to have a copy so I could borrow it from them.I have only just watched Moulin Rouge! and I was told that I would either love it or hate it.  At first, I didn't love it but I knew that I didn't hate it, so I watched it again the next day.  I was more used to everything (including Kylie Minogue's 'Green Fairy' character, at first I was just like 'the point of her being there is ... ?, but now I understand it).Before I wrote this review, I read a few comments on the message boards, and one person said that they special effects were so unbelievable.  That is the whole point of the movie - Luhrmann says in his commentary on the DVD that he wanted a world that was not perfect, but imperfect (as evidenced by Satine and Christian dancing on the clouds around the Eiffel Tower - honestly, how could anyone ever say that that scene was meant to be normal? The dancing on the clouds showed that 'love lifts us all, love is all we need'.  Even Satine realised that after just listening to Christian singing once, and she was a courtisan of all people.)Ewan McGregor did a great job in the leading male role, I've never seen any other movie of his but I'm now a fan.  I saw him in his Paris hotel at the start with his typewriter, and immediately loved him, even though I hadn't seen the rest of the movie.  I loved it when he started singing, absolutely loved it.  His singing won Satine over every time (the first time it stopped her heavy breathing and tiger sounds on the floor - that part I thought was hilarious - and when she tries to end things before her dinner with the Duke, when Christian suggests the 'secret song' so no matter how hard things got they would realise they loved each other.Overall, I thought the movie was well done.  Over the top, perhaps, but that was meant to be the case.  Luhrmann wanted it to be elaborate, colourful and high-energy.  He and his crew most certainly achieved that, but I think the real shout outs should go to Nicole (in particular, after seeing this I really think she deserved the Oscar) and Ewan, because if there wasn't any chemistry between them, it would have been Gigli's predecessor.9.5/10 for sure.",Moulin Rouge!
1795,rich303nyc,worst movie I've seen in a long time,1,9 April 2005,"About the only good thing I can say about this movie is that Nicole Kidman looked HOT. (and normally she is NOT an attractive woman) This movie was bad in nearly every way. It was filmed like some sort of horrible Mtv Hip-Hop video. They have nothing to show and no story to tell, so instead the film makers use very rapid edits and cuts to keep you glued to it like children to a video game. I can understand Nicole Kidman being in this, because she got to be the super-sexy star and romantic lead. Euwan McGregor will do any garbage nowadays as proved by the StarWars crap. I guess the millions of dollars are worth it, but if you added up all Ewan's dialog for the movies he's been in lately it might be the worst in Hollywood History.This movie was so bad that I was actually offended.Don't believe the Hollywood hype about this one.

The idea of using modern songs in a 19th century musical may sound like an awful idea, but it turns out beautifully, because the songs are modified to the actor singing them. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor give some of their best performances in this film, as well as showing off their incredible musical talents. This is a movie you can watch over and over again without it ever getting old. It shows the time period like we've never seen it before and tells a romantic story through the famous Moulin Rouge nightclub.

It was a little weird at first, but throughout the rest of the movie I was on the edge of my seat and I loved every moment of it! The music is exciting and the story is very moving. I fell in love with Ewan McGregor's character and I got to understand and embrace the tragic story of Nicole Kidman's character throughout the movie. Baz Luhrmann successfully and skillfully combined comedy, drama and romance all into one great musical. The only reason I didn't give this movie more than eight out of ten stars is because it obviously displays very many sexual themes, so I do not recommend this movie to younger people.

The contemporary songs in the Bohemian Revival setting work very well for certain scenes, but some scenes, particularly the love scenes between Satine and Christian, would be much deeper and more emotional with conventional background music... The filming/shooting in this movie was refreshing, with camera angles everywhere and zooms all over the place. The effect is slightly overused in my opinion, but is in keeping with the overall ""style"" of the movie. Finally, the acting itself was not bad at all, with great acting and chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, and some fantastic secondary roles. Overall a good movie, but perhaps a little bit overdone, as I guess all musicals are.",Moulin Rouge!
1801,Hermione2004,Greatest movie EVER!!!,10,31 May 2004,"I love this movie! I've watched it tons and tons of times! If you haven't seen it, I recommend it, it's probably not what you expect it would be. It's not just some mushy musical. It's the best movie!! It's funny, it's got really great acting, and it's got great songs including Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana! It's really good. Sad, but good. If you're feeling sad, don't watch the end. Stop it when you think the story is happy, because most parts are really funny and make you laugh a lot. My friend and I are obsessed with Ewan McGregor! He's hott! And he's also a very good actor/singer too. Nicole Kidman did a good job too. Must have been hard for everyone to do. Bravo to all!",Moulin Rouge!
1802,junk-211,Wow.,10,10 June 2004,"My girlfriend introduced me to this film. The use of the musical numbers and the pure joy of just watching it reflects well. When watching this movie I go back to High School when we were producing My Fair Lady. We had standing ovations on every night. I never got tired of watching that show, I knew the lines as well as the actors, and it was a treat to watch. Moulin Rouge takes it's rightful place in my memories right beside it. I've seen Ewan McGregor's work obviously in Star Wars, and just seeing him belt out these awesome, awesome songs gives me get goosebumps. It's amazing what people can do when you least expect it. I had no premonitions when I sat down to watch this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. My advice is the same, don't sit down and expect something that won't happen. Sit down and accept what Baz is trying to show you. I didn't even know he was the director until I came here to look the film up afterwards. I rarely give movies I watch a full star rating, but this one definitely gets it from me.",Moulin Rouge!
1803,jrmiv,Tripe,1,28 December 2004,"I'm having a hard time coming up with ten lines of text for this bomb. I'd rather have summed it up in one (see last two sentences of this comment). The only thing memorable about this farce is that it will likely become a cliché for bad taste. Recipe for Moulin Rouge: Come up with a vacuous story idea. Make it a ""musical"" by borrowing a bunch of sappy, irrelevant, historically inappropriate pop songs and wedging them into the ""plot"". Hire a couple of currently popular movie actors - singing ability not important. Add gobs of garish production, film effects and computer graphics. Add lots of sugar and pour (you may require a spoon to get this sticky mess out of the can). Absolute tripe! Anyone who enjoyed this movie is a bonehead.",Moulin Rouge!
1804,angel_photography,"Fantastic, Emotional, Unforgettable!",10,15 July 2013,"As usual Baz Luhrmann has provided us with a masterpiece, a movie that will make you laugh, dance and cry. Whilst I can understand this not being everyones taste it certainly appealed to the artist in me with its combination of film and theater, and of course a story line about a bunch of struggling bohemian artists trying to make it big. The story line consists of Christian (Ewan McGregor) moving to Paris to pursue his obsession with love and the bohemian lifestyle, and much to his surprise being dragged into writing a play with a bunch of struggling artists. On his first visit to the Moulin Rouge he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman) and sparks fly! The 2 actors have a magical on stage connection that makes the entire movie seem so real, they really make you believe they are madly in love, I sometimes felt like I was inside the story line rather than just watching it, its so easy to get lost in! As is normal with Luhrman the movie is quite fast paced, brightly coloured, the sets are surreal and the acting is highly over the top, all of it making you feel as if you are at the Theatre. A lot of people don't like the fact that original songs weren't written for it but I absolutely loved the song choices, they were quite familiar which allows you to sing along on your first viewing of the film! With such a fast paced, bright, trippy movie we expect a happy ending were the lovers get married and live happily ever after, sadly this isn't so, throughout the film you will notice it get gradually darker and darker, and the ending hit me so hard that I was crying for an hour afterwords! This film is definitely worth a watch, and I know I will watch it again and again and again! If you like art and excitement and creativity, watch it. If you like logic, realistic acting and are strictly against cheesy music then stay away!",Moulin Rouge!

Personally musicals aren't my favorite but this is an absolute masterpiece of a movie. I was engulfed by the emotion, music, and cinematography of this piece. The storyline is incredible and actors Ewan and Nicole deliver. An absolute must see date movie or at home. Be ready to laugh, be ready to cry, be ready to be angry, bottom line is get your movie going machine prepared for a roller coaster of a ride. I've seen this movie 50 plus times and the emotions run deep every time. Have fun.",Moulin Rouge!
1806,piston_free,Realizes what film can truly do,10,4 October 2004,"I'm not going to sit here and give my personal opinion on things like acting quality, emotive reactions to the film, etc., because that ground has been trod into mud by other commenter's and boardcrawlers. All I wish to say here is that this movie is, to me, the realization of what the pioneers of film wished it to be. Think back to the Follies and the Gold Diggers shows of the 1920s. Though they were little more than filmed showing of stage productions, their influence upon Baz is readily evident in this film. And that's what he wanted.This movie, this trilogy (Simply Ballroom, Romeo+Juliet, and Moulin Rouge!, the Red Curtain Trilogy) is Baz's tribute to stage arts: Dance, Drama, and Music. In all three cases, he took pre-existing mediums of stage art and set them to his own, idiosyncratic tune before the camera. Flamenco was flamenco, Shakespeare was Shakespeare, and love ballads are love ballads here. This is why there is so little original musical material in this movie: it is a tribute. And, though I said I would keep my personal opinions out of this one, it's a 10/10 tribute in my eyes.",Moulin Rouge!
1807,Ewan_McGregor14,"A Story About Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and Love",10,4 January 2005,"I love a lot of musicals and I have to say that Moulin Rouge is one of my favorites. Baz Luhrmann, director of ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Romeo & Juliet"" directed this 2001 hit. The movie has extraordinary sets and dazzling costumes, not to mention the brilliant performances by Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, and the rest of the all-star cast. The music in the film is mostly from the 20th century; unlike the story, which takes place in 1899. Here are a few of the songs and their original performers. ""Your Song""  Elton John, ""Like a Virgin""  Madonna, ""Roxanne""  Sting, ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend""  Marilyn Monroe, and ""Nature Boy""  Nat King Cole. It also has one new song that was created for the movie. ""Come What May"" is probably my favorite out of all the songs. Not only is it an original, it is inspiring and tells the true story of the love between the two characters. One song in the film is quite different from its original performance. This is ""Your Song,"" originally sung by Elton John but performed by Ewan McGregor in the film. The beginning of the song actually starts out as poetry. He then breaks out into song right at ""My gift is my song."" It really catches your attention because he sings very fortissimo. John's version is a lot mellower and it moves a little smoother. The key stays the same in both versions, but the notes differ from time to time. It's quite different (the film's version) but it's a really well done rendition of ""Your Song."" It's one of my favorite songs in the film!As mentioned earlier, the costumes are dazzling! Each costume helps to portray that character and their personality. The characters that are morbid and mysterious wore darker colors, unlike some of the exuberant characters that wore bright colors. The dresses are extraordinarily beautiful, each being very colorful and unique. The other costumes in the movie are great too! They are all very detailed, especially Nicole Kidman's dresses and outfits which had sequins, gems, and loads of other decor. The dancing/choreography in this movie is astonishing! Every dance routine is unique and very detailed. It helps the story develop better and gives the viewer some idea of what the characters are feeling. One that comes to mind is the ""El Tango De Roxanne"" dance sequence. As the story unfolds, the characters portray it in their dance. They use sharp, crisp movements throughout the piece to exaggerate certain lines. If the song gets hectic, so does the dance. If it's slow and mysterious, the dance is too.The plot is quite common as with most love stories. You know: boy meets girl, girl plays hard-to-get, another man wants girl, girl finally likes boy, they fall in love, other guy gets in the way of things, girl finally finds her way back to original boy, etc. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a penniless poet who has traveled from London to France. He befriends a group of Bohemians, one of whom is Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo). He also meets the woman of his dreams, Satine, a courtesan and star performer at the Moulin Rouge. Christian composes a play called ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" that ends up being pretty much about his experience in France. The Duke (Richard Roxburgh) wants Satine for himself and will do anything to get her, even if it means killing Christian. The two lovers always seem to outsmart the dimwitted Duke until they are finally found out. The story follows the two characters in their magical journey about beauty, freedom, truth, and above all things, love.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals or even a good love story every now and then. It's a truly inspiring film with a lot of emotional ups and downs. The performances by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are outstanding! They really seem to have good chemistry, which makes the story more believable. Their voices also add to the fun and excitement of the film. The rest of the cast, including Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh, and John Leguizamo are extraordinary also.",Moulin Rouge!

We watched in a fairly empty theater, and that should have been our first clue. It had not been out all that long and nobody was there.Apparently there were others that liked the movie. You just can't add us to the list. The music wasn't interesting. The dialogue wasn't interesting. The plot wasn't interesting. Wish there were more tools available to us before we saw it to get a better idea of what we were about to see. Don't need to worry about renting it or pay-per-viewing, as we saw more than enough the first time...p.s. The worst movie we ever went to, if you are curious, was Leaving Las Vegas.

Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman play well together as the love-struck couple battle against two deadly forces, that are death and jealousy.All the while concealing there love from the duke, who Satine must be with, if she ever wants to leave her life as a prostitute.

It's incredible compositions of music, choreography of dance and the whole plot in general leaves you sitting there in wonder, long after the film was over. Ewan Mcgregor could not have done better. He has an amazing voice and a charismatic presence that makes you fall in love with him from the moment he sings his first line ""the hills are alive with the sound of music"". Nicole Kidman did an incredible job at shaping into the character of Satine. She ended up having a very, very good voice as well. Both of their voices complimented each other. Ewan and Nicole did such a great job that you could actually believe what they were acting. It wasn't as if you were watching a film, but two people who loved each other so much,and overcame all obstacles. Well, nearly all of them...I loved all the actors in this movie, actually (maybe not all the ""characters"", like the Duke) It was extremely well written and I could literally watch it over and over again and still cry at the end. This is a rare film that actually takes you on a journey, all the while you're realizing new things every time you watch it. It's like you're falling in love with them all over again, feeling their pain and longing with them all over again. Maybe it's because I am a music fanatic (not really into musicals, but the Moulin Rouge is a definite exception)And a lover of Paris, but i extremely enjoyed this film and the music.For those people who say that this movie was ""trash"" and ""horrible"", or said things like ""if you liked this, never watch a movie again"", or any of that, I honestly see why they don't like it, and that is: This movie is for the open minded, artistic people of the world. If you're into unique, original and beautiful scenery, music, plot, cinematography that has NEVER been seen before in any other movie or book, then i recommend you watch this movie right away.If you're not, then don't even bother, although you are missing out on something amazing.

1811,rdoyle1-661-20450,Fantastic,9,24 May 2015,The blend of contemporary and original songs and the absolute talents of the cast make this movie one worth watching again. If you can't enjoy this movie there is truly something wrong. This is one of those movies that will live on for a long while and is a great example of mixing movie with music - a great musical. The pure enjoyment of listening to the two main characters playing off each other to the group songs for chorus purposes. The acting of course is excellent as well with a nice spin on the play within a play. The variety of music styles and songs is also a nice change of pace. The love against all obstacles is cliché but this movie puts a nice turn on that standard. The soundtrack has to be magical if it includes these talented folks. Enjoy and just a word - Magical.,Moulin Rouge!
1812,gryffindorprefect16,I Love The Music,10,17 April 2005,"I love the music in this movie... When Christian, Satie, the Doctor, Satine, Toulouse and Zidler are singing the pitch of the play,it is SO hilarious. The Elephant Love Medley is awesome as well as Come What May are awesome. Ewan and Nicole have such loving stage presence and work well together it seems. Their voices are amazing.. I sing along with all the songs and also say the dialog along with the movie. I haven't memorized the whole movie, but I'm close to doing it. That's a bit sad, but I just like the movie so much. I would just have to say that I give the songs as well as the acting a 10 out of 10. I would have to say another song that is funny is Like A Virgin sung by Richard Roxburgh and Jim Broadbent. The Duke really can't sing until the end of the song when he's belting out ""Like A Virgin"" LOL I recommend this movie to all those who haven't seen it.

1813,clara-vanderstichele,Moulin rouge,9,29 May 2013,"I think it is an amazing film! It is not only a very romantic and lovely story, but the whole concept is so original. First of all, I really like the leading actors. Nicola Kidman and Ewan McGregor play their parts perfectly. Because it is a musical, it is standard that there are a lot of songs. When I first heard the songs, I immediately searched them on the internet and listened to them time after time. The music is powerful and has a recognizable beat, but you also have the more quiet and emotional songs. At the beginning, my opinion about the film in general was rather vague because there were strange scenes in it. But after watching it several times, I still love it. A next incredible fact about the film is the decor! It all seems fantastic. You would think the Moulin Rouge is a magic places with shows, drinks and a lot of dancers. But you still know exactly that everything is happening in Paris. The shocking side about this item is that the film wasn't made in Paris at all. Nothing you see about Paris, the buildings, the Moulin rouge itself, is real. I think it's a piece of art. This film is the reason why I like everything about the Moulin rouge. I'm fascinated about it.Therefore I strongly recommend this film, The Moulin Rouge!, to everybody I know!",Moulin Rouge!

It was so a romantic film, it's just like 'Romeo and Juliet', just as beautiful.I hope there will come another movie just as exiting as this one because it's a beautiful story and then the music!The music, it is just the thing that makes the film and the story one!

Maybe this was what was being shown on 9/11 and this is why the planes flew into the Twin Towers. Anything to end the horror of seeing this mawkish teenage drivel.Dreadful music, stupid plot, tenth-rate (no, I'll amend that) twentieth-rate acting. It is utterly amazing that this film has become popular. And what a cheek to steal the title of a perfectly good 1950s biopic (the one with José Ferrer as Toulouse-Lautrec and the nice Mantovani music). Truly a dreadful film and a waste of space.

The songs that are in it are really good ones, with nice text and excellent music. Most of these are extracted from already known songs just one is original from moulin rouge's production. The cast is also excellent, with Nicole kidman and Ewan McGregor you can count on this movies like one of your classic favorites.

1820,benlogela,The Sparkling Diamond,9,27 September 2013,"""Moulin Rouge"" (2001) starts out in Paris with Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young writer who has just come from London, England. The writer begins to type his story, his story of love, jealousy, and betrayal, and how he learned the most important thing in life to learn, ""just to love, and be loved in return"". He begins with end; the woman he loves is dead. It all started a year before, when he first arrived in Paris, France. He rents a room in a hotel and after getting situated, has an unconscious Argentinian (Jacek Koman) fall through his ceiling. He is introduced to the Moulin Rouge through Toulouse (John Leguizamo) and thus begins the story. The love of his life is Satine (Nicole Kidman), the young and very beautiful star courtesan of the night club, Moulin Rouge. He is introduced to her through Toulouse and through a misunderstanding of him being a Count, becomes involved with the Moulin Rouge indefinitely.The film's central idea seems to be that love is the most important thing in life, and the most important lesson to be learned is to love and be loved in return. He does very well at trying to convey that message, and even begins the movie with such. He stresses how important the lesson is, but does well to include comedic areas in Moulin Rouge to not make the whole movie seem so oppressive and heavy. It is a great story about truth, beauty, freedom, and above all else, love.The whole movie is utterly amazing and appealing, and I highly applaud the director, Baz Luhrmann. Although the cinematography could use some help in spots, such as the scene on top of the elephant, the rest of the cinematography was very enjoyable to watch. The characters are realistic and believable, as if they could exist during the time period and area. The colors are dark to convey the dark plot and being about a very seedy nightclub of the film. It's a musical, and the music chosen for this film were perfect choices for this film, especially since all of the music was mostly modern. Altogether, the film was fantastic, and I would recommend anyone who enjoys a good love story or musical to watch this film and enjoy the dark playground that is Moulin Rouge.",Moulin Rouge!
1821,cool_kat888,Brilliant!,10,17 March 2005,"When I saw this the first time, I was with some friends on New Years. We ended up watching it 2 times and that started an obsession of Moulin Rouge and especially Ewan McGregor. The movie is excellent. It is a mixture of comedy and drama. And I did put the warning about a spoiler on there, so I can go and spoil it now. Yes, Satine dies in the end (of course it tells you that info in the beginning, and I personally think that they shouldn't have given that out). And the Duke gets shut down and punched in the face by wonderful Harold Zidler (Good for him!). My favorite part is, of course, the beginning with its invigorating fast pace and funny lines and general... funniness! It is hilarious when Christian (a.k.a. Ewan) is trying to make up a production storyline on the spot, and I love the Duke's expressions to the different ideas! Of course, the highlight of the whole movie was the beautiful singing that came out of lovely Christian's beautiful mouth (lol). Especially their secret song (Come What May). I congratulate the composer or arranger of these songs in the movie, because they are gorgeous, and it sounds amazing! Well, I had better stop myself, though I could go on about this movie FOREVER! If you haven't seen it, do so very very quickly- you will most DEFINITELY not regret it. Unless you're not into musicals so much. But other than that it is fantastic and it is highly, highly commended! I LOVE YOU, EWAN!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1822,tash4000,Poor Pathetic Critics,10,26 February 2005,"If you found Moulin Rouge unlikeable you are either: a) an idiot b) have no appreciation for a fantastic work of art c) an idiot or d) obviously missed the bigger picture of what the film was about.All of you who are sitting there criticizing the film because it has 'songs mixed together' or find the 'plot laughable' truly have not looked beneath the surface of the film. The meaning and messages that Luhrman presents are so significant and important in the world today that it would be stupid to dismiss them.The film is not just about Love and Lost (which I'm sure many of you found corny anyway) but it is also about how giving one's heart and soul to a single purpose will eventually mean overcoming everything. this is not just with Love but with all quests. Although there is loss along the way, eventually the truth really will set you free.The fact that Lurhman teamed the fantastic plot with such a great set up including the music, the cast, the set - hell the whole concept is just fantastic - makes it even more Spectacular.I truly think all of you so called 'critics' out there need to sit down and watch the movie again and not have such a closed mind about it. Be open to the underlying meanings and who knows - you might even learn something about what it takes to make a fantastic movie.",Moulin Rouge!
1823,conway-7,Misunderstood,8,2 August 2006,"Having just read a large number of the other comments, by people who loved the film, and by those that thought it was awful, you can see something of a pattern emerge. Most of the people who thought it was awful don't connect with the style of the film, and given that it has such an in-your-face style, if you don't connect there, then I can well imagine that you'd find it boring, frenetic, lame, etc, etc.It is worth observing at the outset, that the style is very much that of opera - melodramatic, hyper-real, fantastic (as in ""fantasy"", rather than ""really good""). I enjoy this style myself, but I can readily believe other people disliking it intensely.One common objection by people who disliked it is that either the film has no plot, or that the plot is not original. The plot is there, and it is essentially the same story used in several operas of the 19th century, and more than one musical of the 20th. The important insight that helps one understand this film, is that in a well honored tradition stretching back to Homer, the plot is not the ""point"" of the work, but rather the scaffolding on which the story-telling occurs. In opera, it is most unusual to walk in to the theater without already knowing the plot. Homer's ""Odessy"" and ""Iliad"" are both stories that would have been known by his audience. In both cases, the cleverness, the art, is in how the story is told. Moulin Rouge! is very much opera for the big screen, and it is built on this conception of story-telling. So, yes, it is style over substance, and deliberately so.That said, if a plot is to be successful scaffolding to tell an engaging story, then it has to have some bones to it. This classic story of the consumptive courtesan who falls in love has lots of song themes in it about what is important in life, life's fleeting nature, and so on. Where the film loses many people, who haven't connected to the operatic style, is that having communicated enough bits of the plot to tell us which story is being told (and the bookend structure tells us that right away), there is no obligation to join all the dots. Having given us the message that it is *this* story, it can skip over the details of the plot in order to concentrate on which ever aspects of the telling it likes.This is clear in how the snatches of song are used. The goal is evocation rather than elucidation.Anyway, enough criticism.I recommend this film, not because I can predict whether it will be to your taste or not, but because it is an excellent example of a very different style of story-telling to what we usually see in film.",Moulin Rouge!
1824,mandy568815,"Spectacular, Spectacular!",10,23 March 2005,"This is by far one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life! The music is so unbelievably awesome! The actors fit their parts as if that was what they were born to do. If you believe in truth, beauty, freedom, and love this is the movie for you. I have seen Moulin Rouge more times than i can possibly count, and i still love it. This is one of those movies that never gets old. The love and romance the two characters have for each other it so unbelievable. It makes everyone want and crave the love they share! The greatest thing about the movie is not just the love they have, but the love they long to posses! In conclusion, WATCH THE MOVIE! I Guarantee a good cry and a warm feeling in your heart.

1825,EdwardmyLove,Moulin Rouge,10,31 March 2005,"I loved this movie when I saw it on VH1 and bought it right away. After I bought it, I watched it at least 12 times(no exaggeration) and now any time someone says something that came from the movie, I finish the scene out in my mind or under my breathe! It is my all time favorite movie and I think every household(with children over the age of 13) should own a copy! Ewan McGregor became my favorite actor(and crush of all times...bigger than Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp!) and I think he played the part of Christian perfectly. Nicole Kidman nailed the part of Satine and every movie I see now with her in it, all I see is Satine. The sets were amazing and the colors were crazy, making my eyes go nuts trying to find a solid image to focus on. Again, my praise to this film and those who worked on it. Now, if you will excuse me, talking about Moulin Rouge makes me need to go and watch it again!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1826,JulieAndrewsNut,On my top 10 list,10,12 June 2005,"I first watched Moulin Rouge because it was a musical, but it turns out it's not just any ordinary musical- it's a story that's heartbreaking and realistic.Set in 1899, in Paris, France, it's a vivid love story. Christian, a handsome young writer, comes to Paris from London to write about truth, beauty, freedom, and love, the ideals of the Bohemian Revolution, despite his father's scorn of the whole idea. There was only one problem with this- he'd never been in love before.As he is puzzling about how to write about something he'd never experienced, a Narcoleptic Argentinean falls through his ceiling from the flat above his own, and a carefree, laughing dwarf comes in to rescue the Argentinean. The dwarf, the Argentinean, and three other men who are peering down through the hole in Christian's ceiling are working on a play called Spectacular Spectacular, which they are to present to Harold Zidler the next day. Christian comes up to substitute for the Argentinean, who is still unconscious, and an argument ensues among the other men on what the words and tune to a song in the play should be. When Christian comes up with the perfect match, it is voted that he write the play.Zidler is the owner of the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub where ""the rich and powerful come to play with the young and beautiful creatures of the underworld"". Toulouse, the dwarf, passes Christian off as a famous English writer, and arranges for him to meet with Satine, the most beautiful of all the Moulin Rouge dancers, who will, in turn, convince Zidler to have Christian write the play.Zidler had arranged, however, for Satine to meet a duke that evening, which is who Satine mistakes Christian for, and soon Satine has to choose between the two men. The duke falls in love with Satine and shows her all the wonderful things he can give her, but Christian shows Satine all the things that true love can be. As it becomes harder to hide their love, Satine has another problem that is becoming harder to avoid- a more personal one that leads to a tragic climax.This is a beautiful story that definitely makes my top 10 list of movies- I recommend it.",Moulin Rouge!

I watched it so many times in the cinema and I just couldn't wait 'till it came out on DVD. Once I got it on DVD, I watched it everyday for 3 weeks!!It's funny. It's romantic. It's musical. It's everything! I just love everything about it. I appreciated Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor more. They did a such great job in that film. The whole cast. They did such a good job with everything. The props, the location, the cast, the directing, everything.To those of you who haven't seen it, I suggest you do. It's really good.The soundtracks aren't bad either.",Moulin Rouge!
1828,mafegth,Beautiful!,10,13 June 2006,"When I was to see Moulin Rouge, I didn't quite know what to expect. Some people had told me that they loved it, but some said it was boring. I couldn't disagree more. After seeing it the first time i was amazed. The music, the actors, the feeling I was left with, it was really wonderful!Ewan McGregor is excellent as the English writer Christian, who comes to Paris to be a part of the bohemian revolution. He is to write a play that are going to be shown at the moulin rouge, a nightclub, ruled over by Harold Zidler, where the rich comes to dance and have fun with the creatures of the underworld. There he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), a courtesan and a cancan-dancer, who wants to become a real actress. They fall in love, but love between them is impossible. It's a classic love story, told in a new way.This is a movie that makes you both laugh and cry. The many singing and dancing numbers are spectacular, and Kidman and McGregor sings very well (I especially think McGregors voice is fantastic). Also the dancers impresses me much.One of the things that I like so much about this film is the way the use modern songs we all know (Smells like teen spirit,your song and like a virgin, to mention some of them), and makes them fit in to this beautiful story from the beginning of the last century. The cutting are also special, and (according to me) good. And not to mention the costumes, they are incredible.. All in all, watching this movie is a real pleasure, and you should all see it!",Moulin Rouge!

Standing for truth, beauty, freedom and love rather breaks your heart...Yet only so U have one:) Spectacular spectacular indeed as for music, heroes which love, fight for it and so they bleed in more sensual, passionate ways...Carresing ones able to feel deeper causes and dreams-live them thorough over and over again. Ewan McGregor(poor writer) plays a role of an enchanted one who meets Love for the first time finding it in a beautiful cortisone played by Nicole Kidman (Satine) who seems to have lost belief in love's embrace-but only in very beginning... Nicole have said:""It's better to Love for real and lose your everything than live and never know what true love is."" So this is the story of Moulin Rouge! Hope you felt it:)",Moulin Rouge!
1830,yenoh,Love it! Love it! Do I need to say more?,10,26 May 2005,"This movie is the best movie ever! I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. The whole story is so wonderful, and somebody may see this movie only as a cliché, but I think it's brilliant! It's Supposed to be a story about love, so well...I think Baz did a very nice job ;o) He also did a great job when casting the movie. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were the perfect choices for this movie. They did a great job, and I guess I'm not the only one who had a huge crush on Ewan after seeing this movie. He's such a great actor and he has a lot of emotion to share with the audience who watches this movie. And not only is he a great actor, but he can sing as well! He has a beautiful voice which made me melt every time I heard him sing. Nicole Kidman did a great job as well. She has a lovely voice, and proves she can sing as well. She was perfect for the role as Satine and Ewan was perfect for the role as Christian. I also think Richard Roxburgh did a great job as the Duke. As I said, great actors! This is really a movie which is worth watching. Truly the best movie I've ever seen! You don't have to be a true musical-fan to like this movie, because it's just something about it which makes it awesome, musical-fan or not. See this movie, you won't regret! 10/10",Moulin Rouge!

1832,d-annyallen,You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs...,8,3 November 2016,"A musically creative and awe inspiring visual dream that taps into all the emotions of life. It is nearly perfect in its artistic delivery of the bohemian, free spirit of 1900 Paris with a delightful modern flare. It isn't your typical movie musical, so I am guessing you have to like the arts and be open-minded the boundaries it crosses. You feel like you are walking into a painting and experiencing the chaos, the sin, the poverty, the non-conformity, and artistic, free- spirited beauty of bohemian life. It loses one star because the beginning came off a little too chaotic -- hang in there, it's worth it. Really awesome film.",Moulin Rouge!
1833,totallylost202,A love story like every other which is like no other,10,3 June 2005,"I think what I said above just about sums Moulin Rouge! perfectly. It is a love story like every other love story, but it is like no other love story.A paradox? Maybe, but that's exactly what this movie is.Firstly, let me just say that to fully enjoy this movie, you have to have an open mind. Forget reality and forget conventions. Moulin Rouge! isn't about reality and is as unconventional a movie as can be. Stop trying to ""understand"" it, and eventually, you will understand it. Secondly, you must be warned that it's a love-it-or-hate-it kinda movie. You're either a huge fan of the movie and have everything from the 2-disc special edition DVD to your own MR! t-shirt, or you hate it so much that you just want to point a gun to the character's heads. Don't listen to everything critics say. They are most likely the ones who hate this movie, as they spend a whole lifetime trying to ""understand"" movies, and when one like this comes along, they don't know what to do with it. They give it 0/10 before even giving it a second chance. A typical case of prejudice. You are not them, and so you at least owe it to yourself to give this movie a try.Now, let's talk about the actual movie. Moulin Rouge! is simply everything a movie should be. It has comedy. It has action. It has romance. It has drama. It has every filming style imaginable, from Disney to Bollywood. It is old vs. modern. I mean, which other movie has beautiful computer visual effects (some of which are reported to be the longest in movie history!) yet also has the old ""hand-made"" style of film-making, with unusual (and even wobbly) camera angles, on purpose? Which other movie has men in top hats singing Nirvana and beautiful courtesans singing Randy Crawford songs?The plot in itself is a run-of-the-mill love story, taken from the operas ""La Boheme"" and ""La Traviata"", taken from Dumas' ""La Dame aux Caméllias"". Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a young, middle-class writer who wants something new in life. He wants to write a brilliant novel with a beautiful love story at the heart of it. The only problem is... he has never been in love. Stuck in a rut in London with his overly-religious father, he decides to move away to Paris, the city of love, to become part of the Bohemian revolution. After an accident involving a Narcolpetic Argentinian, a very sweet and apologetic Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo) and a falling roof, he meets a group of kind-hearted Bohemians who believe he is the one to help them write a show they are currently in the process of. The show is extremely important to them because it is a show all about their ideals of Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love. However, they have other plans for it: they want to show it to the new financier of the Moulin Rouge, a Duke (Richard Roxburgh), whom they hope will agree to fund the conversion of the famous nightclub into a theatre. Now with a new writer for the show, the Bohos need a star for it. They immediately think of the Moulin Rouge's beautiful, top courtesan Satine. Before he can say ""The hills are alive with the sound of music"", Christian is off to the Moulin Rouge to convince Satine to be in the show. He sees her performing her rendition of ""Diamonds are a girl's best friend"" and is immediately head over heels in love with her. The only problem is, Satine is needed elsewhere. At the same time, on a table nearby, the Duke is waiting for Satine to finish her show. However, the Bohos had told Christian that Satine would meet with HIM after the show... and you can guess what happens next... yep, you've got it... Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke! Alone in her boudoir with Christian, inside an Elephant, Satine tries flat out to seduce this Duke who is actually Christian. Christian's Orphean soul makes Satine fall in love with him as he sings his own rendition of ""Your Song"". However, after finding out that he is in fact NOT the Duke, Satine tries to take back all the feelings she had. However, true love is not like that, and before you know it, they're kissing passionately on top of the Elephant. Another thing about true love is that it's unmistakable to miss, and before long, everyone else at the Moulin Rouge finds out about Christian and Satine's affair... apart from the Duke. To keep the Duke out of the know, Satine still has to seduce him and the night comes when she has to sleep with him... but she can't do it as she cares too much about Christian, and then it builds into a heart-wrenching climax... you'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean!!",Moulin Rouge!
1834,thr2183,"Just recycled, nothing original",1,6 June 2005,"When I first saw the movie, I gave up after 10 minutes, walked out of the theatre and kicked myself that I just have wasted 8$ on it. I just could not connect the use of modern songs with a historic setting. Convincing myself that I might just have had a bad day, and telling myself to have an open mind, I watched the DVD all the way through. Good grief, what a drag, and was I happy that I have just borrowed it from friends! A poor excuse for a plot, no character development at all, recycled (or, dare I say, massacred) pop songs, recycled ideas (La Boheme, La Traviata, Orpheus in the underworld), and, on top of that, dialogues which are mostly made up of strings of song titles, or repetitions of the key lines of the songs that have just been performed, the rest being commonplace statements. The only amazing thing is the art direction ,scoring a well deserved Oscar, but that's about it! Seemingly, Baz Luhrmann could not decide whether to make a movie (not enough plot) or an MTV video clip (too long, but still using the modern editing style of a video of light-speed camera moves and nano- second scene changes, which makes everyone older than 21 just nauseous!), and , most probably to keep the risk factor low, did not use even the tiniest bit of original ideas! Zip! Zero! Zilch! It has its funny moments, but they are too rare to make up for its shortfalls, such as lack of depth. The term love is used about 1000 times, however I could not connect to the characters (there is just not enough plot), and Satine's death left me stone cold. In short: a total waste of time.",Moulin Rouge!
1835,pdiaztapia,"Extremely left down, expected much much more.",2,6 December 2015,"It must have been the fact that before this movie I watched the beautiful masterpiece that Chicago (2002) is! After having a great time watching one of the best musical movies I've seen, I was left wanting more so I went to my Netflix recommendations and saw Moulin Rouge. What a great mistake, Netflix! I'm pretty sure I didn't see more that 30 minutes of the movie as I ended up having a terrible headache and even wanted to vomit. I have never, ever stopped watching a movie after so little time. If something, I think this movie has the record of sickening me in the shortest amount of time.It's definitely not a good musical as the singing could not be appreciated because of all the horrible noise around it. Everything had me feeling dizzy and feeling embarrassed for the movie. A specially cringe-worthy scene was the one with the Tinkerbell like fairy doing this strange dancing and looking extremely fake. I've seen some people that also hated the movie say that at least the Art Direction was decent but I really couldn't see pass the bizarre camera effects. Well, I got to see the horrible make- up worn by the ""Diamond girls"" which were supposed to be the most beautiful women in all France. Well, I was extremely disappointed in that department.Still, I must admit that Lady Marmalade is one of the best pop songs I've ever heard and is a great collaboration between 2000's most successful pop ladies. I was left wanting to hear the whole song and watching a similar performance as the music video but they could even take good advantage of it.I don't recommend it at all. Disappointing.",Moulin Rouge!

1837,jev-3,Excellent!,10,29 June 2005,"This movie is tragic, but that is an integral part of the story. I think it is still a wonderful movie, and I'm not the type that likes sad movies. If you like love stories or musicals, and even if you don't, you should find time to sit down and watch the movie. Even though you can understand the movie without giving it your full attention, it would really be a shame to miss the visuals presented in the movie. From the first moment you see Christian sitting at his typewriter, there are subtleties that are present throughout the movie serving to raise the enjoyment of the viewer. One of the most visually stimulating scenes in the movie is the initial dance scene in which Christian first lays eyes on Satine, and most of the other scenes are just as gripping as that one. No matter what type of movie you like, this one is a must-see. The music, the dancing, the love interest, and the comedic undertones all combine to make this film a fantastic experience.",Moulin Rouge!
1838,diengurl,Moulin Rouge Theme,9,30 June 2015,"Yes. Yes it is 2015 and I am reviewing Moulin Rouge, which I am aware came out in 2001. I have seen this movie well over 100 times and can sing, not well, every song from the movie. Now that is out of the way I will give an actual review of this movie. The theme of this review is ""theme."" Spoiler alert, it's not love. Or is it?It's the very early 1900's and Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young writer, moves to Paris. He meets Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) and agrees to help him and other actors in this Bohemian movement to finish and present their show ""Spectacular Spectacular"" to Harold Zigler (Jim Broadbent), the owner of the infamous Moulin Rouge. Well to make ones dreams come true, a few white lies are invented and next thing you know Christian is not some poor writer but instead posing as the Duke of Monroth (which is later played by Richard Roxburgh) to convince the star courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman) to listen to their work who they hope will later take it to Harold.Long story short Satine discovers Christian isn't who he says he is, they fall in love despite this fact. Unfortunately she is a prized ""whore"" and needs to actually be with the Duke to save the failing Moulin Rouge but is starting to feel guilty because she is in love. The Duke finds out about Christian and Satine and tries to rape her. Satine decides to give up her life at the Moulin Rouge for a life with a penniless writer but soon finds out she is dying and ends it with Christian to ""save him"" but instead it backfires. She dies. But before passing, they reconcile. Christian is heartbroken.Let's talk about theme. The fact that I have been watching this film for almost fifteen years I have discussed this film with many people during that time. A common topic is theme. Most of the time the answer is love. Is love actually a theme? No. Love plays a role in many themes especially in this film; moral implications, the truth of human nature, the struggle for human dignity, complexity of human relationships and coming of age. Lets pick one. I will put it out there the theme of Moulin Rouge is the coming of age/loss of innocence/growing awareness.Let's examine each one.  Coming of Age. Christian left home for Paris to be a famous writer. He is new to a big city and we have to watch him develop into a man.  Loss of Innocence. This applies both to Christian and Satine. Christian for obvious reasons (falling in love with a courtesan) and Satine because being a ""whore"" was the only life she has ever known.  Growing Awareness. Christian and Satine realize life is not always what it presents itself to be. These two realized if in opposite ways. Christian ended up realizing it is sometimes worse than you want it to be and Satine realizing it can be better than you think it is. Of course that's before she dies. This film is shot well. The editing creates the needed chaos for emotion. The visual effects are appropriate to each scene. Costume and makeup design are on point. And don't even get me started on how amazing they did as singers There is emotion created from this film. You may not like it, you may think it's cheesy but I respect that this film was shot different than anything else I have ever seen. I liked the organized chaos and I enjoyed watching Christian and Satine come of age, lose their innocence and grow more aware of who they are as individuals and as lovers.",Moulin Rouge!

1840,austindavis-65473,The Moulin Rouge,9,28 February 2016,"I decided to watch the movie The Moulin Rouge. I was first introduced to this movie by my wife and I have loved it ever since. It is a compelling comedic love story based in a historical setting with real historic references to war, art, diseases and artistic revolution upon a fictional story line along with fictional character. Through this critique we will be looking at some essentials of the plot, theme and characters as well as analysis, interpretations, evaluations and engagements.So starting with the plot, characters. The plot surrounds a penniless bohemian revolutionary writer and his love interest, a courtesan in a night club known as the Moulin Rouge who is aspiring to be an actress. The villain in this story is portrayed as a misogynist duke who falls in love with the courtesan and wants her for himself. The duke plays an essential role in the plot because he is not only the villain, but the main cause of the plot. The duke shows his essential characteristics in two ways. The first, he is the wedge between the protagonist and his love interest. The second goes into this because the wedge is because the duke is the only one who has offered to fund turning the Moulin Rouge from a night club to a theatre to that the courtesan can have her dream. The penniless writer is accidentally thrown into it under the impression that he would become the Moulin Rouges head writer for the bohemian revolution. However, because he falls in love with her, and very unfortunate miscommunications, the courtesan falls for the writer to the point where she cannot bring herself to betray the writer by satisfying the duke for his money.The theme is very easy to perceive. The theme is set in France in the year 1900. At this time, France was going through a revolution of arts and expression which was known as the Bohemian Revolution. The theme is mixed with some modern principles and songs but for the most part, keeps true to the history of the time period with dance, dress, art and even historical facts and political views at the time. The protagonist shows the purpose of this theme early in the movie as he remembers the conflict he had with his father concerning the difference in socially accepted principles. The main theme of this is of an early 1900s night club but does transform, adding to the theme of the Bohemian Revolution itself, into a more artistic and higher culture form of entertainment. Analyzing this film, there are many themes and characterizations that carry throughout the film. Starting with the theme that has been developed. The protagonist going from a household deemed by society as well developed and mannered, to a community that sees art and behavior more liberally, it shows the increasing liberal nature of humanity and self-expression. Characterizations are more along the lines of usual night clubs where most of the men and women involved in this story are more sex driven than those who are not, or in other words, the protagonist and his group are pretty much the only characters who are not driven by sexual desires in this movie. The interpretation the Moulin Rouge as a movie and a concept is trying to provide is that love is greater than anything anyone can offer. With the duke and the courtesan, as stated in the plot, the courtesan cannot sacrifice love just to win over money from a possessive duke.This movie, looking at it, is probably not within the confines of higher art, and would most likely be put in the wonderful, ever expanding box of popular culture. The movie in itself has enough comedy and sexual innuendos that it could possibly be considered boring or offensive to those of higher art or of previous generations. I consider this entertaining because of the comedy and music, such things are relatable to our current pop culture and other pieces of culture that us as an audience find entertaining, livable, or just plain hilarious. This is due to the overbearing underwhelming even childish special effects (e.g. mustached moon singing in background) and overdone makeup to help illustrate the colors and theme of the movie. Looking at reviews of this movie from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, it is a general 7-7.5 out of 10. However, most of the users of IMDb found it to be the best movie they have seen in a long time. As well according to IMDb, this film was the first musical nominated for best picture in 10 years, the last being Beauty and the Beast. Most of the reviews I have seen have matched my review and personal opinions of the movie based on the plot, characters, themes, and overall likeableness of the film. I would definitely give it a higher rating than the average given, probably at least an 8-8.5 but that is just me. Overall this is an exceptional film if you are not looking for a higher culture performance or form of entertainment that can come from this picture. The plot and characters are very easy to believe and the theme is very appropriate along with the music. Everything was put together very nicely and very professionally and I have to say, it was a great movie, would love to watch it again or recommend it to others.",Moulin Rouge!
1841,kmarie99_99,I hate it!,1,25 October 2005,I thought that this was the worst movie that I have ever watch. I have never walked out of a movie theater until the day I tried to sit through this movie. I tried to watch it again because everyone said that it got really good at the end and I thought that maybe I did not watch long enough. But watching it all the way thought I realized that I hated it worse the second time. But I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion if you liked it good for you. I thought the the acting was almost as bad as the storyline. I especially dislike movies that give away the ending in the first 2 min. of the movie. But actually her death at the end was the most interesting part of the movie.,Moulin Rouge!
1842,sakurablossom-71762,Spectacular Spectacular!,9,12 March 2016,"The story of Moulin Rouge begins with a despaired young man, Christian, typing at his typewriter, alone in a dark, shabby apartment he clicks away the tragedy that the audience is about to watch. Flashing back he runs into others in his building he is convinced to write a play for the famous Moulin Rouge, a nightclub in Paris. There he is mesmerized by Satine, the star of the show, and that night they begin their elusive love affair that would eventually bring down the walls of conventional romance. Although they attempt to keep it secret they can't hide their feelings from themselves or others around them. From this, the investor of the club, the Duke, finds out and gives Satine an ultimatum, continue to see Christian or shut down the nightclub. She makes the choice to give the writer up and star in the show one last time before leaving to marry the Duke. In the end Christian cannot take that the love of his life abandons him for fame and confronts her on opening night. Face to face with him Satine can no longer keep up the charade, she confesses that she was coerced by the evil Duke and falls into Christian's arms as the curtain drops. But, this is the point where a happy ending turns to tragedy. Satine, having consumption, dies there as he holds her tightly. In the end we relay back to the old broken apartment and the final thoughts of the man, heartbroken, alone and depressed from losing the only first love he has ever known.Obviously my short synopsis doesn't give the extraordinary value that this plot line deserves. The story flows very well and feels complete in the end. There are only a few questions or plot holes but they don't take away from the main story. Stunningly the feature is completed in only 127 minutes, which is typical for a musical and not long at all. Usually sitting in a movie for 2 hours can be daunting but with such a compelling fun story it doesn't feel like a task. No matter how many times I watch it, which is probably close to 50, I still get thrown for a loop with the ending. I love watching every scene and seeing the story unfold time after time. Something else I enjoy a lot from this film is the time period. Set in the middle of the Bohemian Revolution in 1899 Paris, France it takes you back to a time where art, freedom, love and beauty brought together a beggared society just trying to find their place in the world. It is very accurate towards that era and the production team worked very hard to bring it together. Although they filmed most of it in a studio the set they built represented what the real Moulin Rouge would have been like in 1899. To mimic the lifestyle they placed the time at night, which was when most of the indigent, lowlife traversed. They kept the inside of the Moulin Rouge bright and glowing to show that it was the main focus and a sort of ""saving grace"" for the vagabonds that ventured there. They bring to life its high point just before it burnt down in 1915.Not only is the setting fantastic, the costumes live up to the same standards. With a variety of time period garments such as can-can dancer dresses, men's coattail suits with top hats and elegant bustled dresses, it brings an attraction and as the French would say gena sa qua. Each costume is unique, having its own personality and I really love finding little details that I missed the previous time, there's always something new to see. You can tell that a lot of research and work went into creating these time pieces.Moulin Rouge brings together not only an original score but a compilation of songs from well-known artist. Musicians such as David Bowie, U2, The Beatles, and Elton John lend their poetic lyrics to invoke heartfelt emotion into the story. The majority of the songs are very meaningful and pull the audience into the moment. But not all are like that, the rest are catchy and exciting, such as ""Lady Marmalade"" and ""Spectacular Spectacular"", they make you want to get up and dance. My favorite would have to be ""Roxanne"". There is not one cast member that I don't believe fits the part they played. Besides being my favorite actor, Ewan McGregor, who plays Christian, was picked over top actors such as Leo DiCaprio and Heath Ledger. His counterpart, Nicole Kidman, who is coincidently my favorite female actress, won the Golden Globe for best actress for her work in this film.The most important thing I took from this movie is the metaphor that it engrafts. This story is about freedom, beauty, truth and most relevantlove. Love is the strongest motif and is represented through the whole film. The relationship between Christian and Satine symbolizes such a pure and true love that anyone should aspire to. It is also about overcoming all obstacles and living your dreams. The freedom to not only be with who you want but to not be trapped by the confines of what society says you should be.A movie with such symbolism is not well received by all. I believe that these few who look down upon it are not willing nor see the message that is lain before them. I hope that whoever sees this takes into their heart the deeper meaning. It's not just about how well the costumes are made or what actors play in it, it's about what someone takes away from it at the end and uses to influence their own life. Moulin Rouge is one of the greatest movies I have seen in my time and I feel honored to have discovered it and its true value to the world.",Moulin Rouge!
1843,moviemax777,I don't like musicals but I looooove this film,9,20 August 2005,"I din't see this film till very recently because I'm not a fan of musicals. But a friend convinced me to give it a chance and I'm real glad I did. The film is visually stunning. It feels as though you are watching everything happen within a big, richly decorated Christmas tree covered in fairy-lights :-) The music isn't originally written for the film, but who cares. The tracks that are used, their arrangement and blending with the screen visuals is absolutely fantastic. As for Kidman and McGregor, fair play to them. They can both sing and have really good voices. Anyway......great film, which is going to be right up you're street if you like sparkling visual feasts and good music. I wonder how many other people who thought they didn't like musicals watched this film and suddenly realised what they'd been missing......i know I did LOL.",Moulin Rouge!
1844,Elphine,The show must go on..,9,5 May 2016,"I watched this for the first time a couple of years ago after turning it off after about 10 minutes and I've only just recently tried to watch it again - now I love it! :-) At first it's a little fast paced and it's definitely something that grows on you in time, the more you watch it and get included into the sad yet beautiful story of the Moulin Rouge! Ewan McGregor's performance in this is super and he has such a lovely voice. You get attached to the characters quickly and get sent on an emotional roller- coaster which may or may not result in tears - it did for me! Overall, it's amazing, the storyline, the cast, the imagination, the songs!The show must go on :-)",Moulin Rouge!
1845,sanjacharmedcat,Great movie!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,1 November 2005,"I love this movie so much!It's great!Entertaining,interesting and touching!Very touching!Especially the end,when Satine dies!It just makes me cry each and every time I watch it!!!Nicole Kidman,the best actress on the world like she is,makes this movie even better!She has such a beautiful voice!Hard to believe it's hers,but it really is!!!She's so talented!Can't remember a single bad movie of hers!She's #1!!!

1846,Rpg_W,I Actually Liked It,10,25 November 2005,"I saw this movie on a bus. Of course the impact with watching movies on a bus isn't as big as watching it at home. But I actually liked it. I'll admit I joked about it during and after the movie, but I always do that with movies.I didn't expect I was going to like it, I mean it's a lovestory mixed with music. Not really my kind of thing, but for some reason this movie gripped me. Ewan and Nicole really shine. As well as the other actors. The chaotic filming at times didn't feel misplaced at all. I also didn't find any weak songs, they al fit the scene perfectly and are sang excellent. To be honest: I didn't find any flaws.Definitely a must-see if you ask me. Even if it's not your kind of genre",Moulin Rouge!
1847,lmulgrew,Amazing!,10,5 September 2005,"This is the greatest film I have seen for a long time. The story is wonderful and the characters are fantastic and beautifully played. Even if you're not a fan of musicals, I would recommend this film to you. I cannot imagine the roles of Satine and Christian being played by any other actors as they are both magnificent. Also, all the songs are sung by the actors themselves, which is even better! The way modern songs are used and put together, especially in Elephant Love Song Medley, is brilliant. This film has everything: romance, comedy, tragedy and music. I truly cannot say a bad word about it. Please please watch it, you will not be disappointed!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1848,liam1986ukuk,Excellent film 10/10,10,15 September 2005,"My friend got me to watch this film and my first thought was that it was going to be rubbish.....but this film is the most fantastic film i have ever seen, pure genius! There is nothing in this film that i don't like. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Ewan Mcgregor and Nicole Kidman were excellent in this film. I don't think there could have been any other actor/actress who had such chemistry to star in this film. Also the songs are amazing. I didn't realise that both were such good singers, so was very impressed when i first watched it. Totally brilliant. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a little bit of comedy, drama and good songs. My number one film. :)",Moulin Rouge!
1849,everockley,fantastic!!!!!!,10,21 May 2006,"from the first moment i saw this film, i loved it, i loved the characters, the songs, the acting is spot on, the editing was perfect, it started great and finished great. i cant understand why some people do not like it. the film even makes you want to get up move and sing along, which( i no its a bit sad) i do. you can see the real connection between Satine and Christian which in some romance films is quite rare. i often get really angry at the duke and his 'shananigans'. i cry every time i see the end which is often rare because i cant hold it in. i wish that Satine didn't die in the end however thats life. great work Baz.",Moulin Rouge!
1850,faa69,Moulin Rouge,10,28 September 2005,"I loved Moulin Rouge!! I am a university student studying film and it is one of my all time favourites, along with Romeo & Juliet (also by Baz Luhrmann) then there is Trainspotting, a classic, and Amores Perros and finally (It may be sad but I love its predictability) Scream. Many of you may think it's the saddest film ever but I don't care, I love it. Moulin Rouge is at the top of my list, the music, the colours, the actors, all of it, I have no complaints at all. Ewan McGregor has an amazing voice and is pretty yummy too. One of my favourite things is the Elephant Love Medley (yes I am that sad I have the soundtrack) it has so many songs in it that usually I wouldn't listen to but in Moulin Rouge, it works brilliantly. Also Exan McGregor's rendition of Your Song by Elton John is fabulous, absolutely fabulous. Moulin Rouge is a classic film, with many typical aspects of romantic films, with a twist that makes it even better.",Moulin Rouge!
1851,nycex360,stunning,10,13 October 2005,"I think this movie is the most wonderful display of love and heartbreak. The music is incredible and the acting is top notch. I love the way this movie presents itself. Sure i like movies like kill bill and harold and kumar go to white castle, but this will surely touch you even if you've felt the slightest bit in love before.I cant believe anyone would dislike this movie. its unlike any movie ever made. i think this is a must see movie. This is one of my favorite movies. I'll never get tired of watching this movie. anyone that wants to discuss this message me on aim at nycex360. !!!! 111 222 333 444 555 666 777 888 999",Moulin Rouge!
1852,gigglebitch22,the best movie i have ever seen,10,15 October 2005,"This film is a feast for the senses. While at first the film's edgy, dramatic touch may be a bit daunting, give this movie ten minutes and you will be sucked in. There is an infectious humour and reality in this film. You almost feel like you are in the room, and it is a private show for you. As a music lover, the songs in this blew me away. Who would of known that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman had such amazing voices? The medleys just blew me away. All the songs really work together better than some may have thought. I cannot stop watching this film, and now I know almost every single word. It does not get old and is still exciting. You also see things that you didn't see the previous time. This is an exceptional film and is my all-time favourite film.",Moulin Rouge!
1853,bryant5953,Tragic Love Story Indeed,3,7 November 2005,"This movie was a colossal disappointment for me. I enjoyed Romeo + Juliet tremendously and I really like Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, so this seemed like a can't miss.Unfortunately you could dive feet first into a puddle of this movie and not even get your socks wet. All the dialogue was contrived to find meaningful poetic snippets of great songs and compile them into one fluid love story. The idea has merit, but the execution was all wrong. The lines didn't tie together well and totally lacked the emotion of the songs themselves. This left little to no character development and almost no emotional attachments which should be important to a ""tragic love story."" Another problem I have is that a lot of the mystery is taken away in the opening monologue, not that that would be enough to wreck a movie, but in this case, there is no reason for it. So with the ending already decided you look to the actors to hold your interest and find yourself being even further let down. You hope the dialogue can at least carry some interest but that dies quickly too. I can't believe the hype for this movie, but then, I can't believe Britney Spears has sold millions of albums either. You can't trust the general public.The filming, set-design and costumes are the only reason this film received any stars at all in my book. Brilliant colors, multiple crazy angles/cuts and wild sets however weren't enough to hold any interest.I describe this movie as being liked by people that THINK they're artistic and creative but truly have no depth.",Moulin Rouge!
1854,enjoyinginsanity-1,A tragic emotional film,10,16 January 2006,"I was recently invited to a movie night at my friends house, and when I heard we were going to watch Moulin Rouge I was horrified.""A musical?"" I thought, ""don't make me gag."" But as I started watching the movie, I realized how tragic the story really was. After the initial laughter and dancing, I began to feel a stirring behind my eyes as I watched true love being played out in a heart-breaking manner.Ewan McGregor was spectacular in this film, bringing just the right amount of sensitivity to a very hard role to play. He managed to come off as both jealous and heart-broken when Satine goes to sleep with the Duke, which I find would be very hard to pull off.But the true star of this movie is undoubtedly Nicole Kidman as Satine. She is sultry yet vulnerable and innocent in her role, and she was the one that truly made me start to tear up. The expressions she went through as she learned she was dying were subtle yet so emotionally powerful.The only complaint I have about this film, is that they seem to love piling tragic incidents on top of one another without leaving us room for a breather.It goes from hide love, love is found out, love is killed off, love is regained, love is killed off again, love is regained again, love is killed off again, love is regained, and then finally to love is gone when Satine dies.It seems to go a bit too fast, but that doesn't hinder the story very much. The ending is still just as tragic and moving.I'd recommend this story to just about anyone...well, anyone but insensitive idiots with the emotional range of a spoon. :3",Moulin Rouge!
1855,Guineapigl77446,"Music, Passion, Dance, and Romance!",10,13 November 2005,"When I rented Moulin Rouge I did not realize at all how much i would grow attached to this movie. It may not be to everyone's liking but people should give it a chance...I did and it really connected with me.First, the music and dance in this movie was absolutely mind blowing. It was stunning to see the actors and actresses dance and sing like they did. The dance numbers were shocking ,but in a good way. The dances are so unique and stunning to look at, I got lost in them!The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman was a real treat because it is such a rare thing for two people to be perfect like this in a role. Their acting skills really stand out in this movie, when they are in a scene with each other you can tell what they are feeling by just looking in their eyes. The sound of their voices really surprised me. I had no idea Nicole Kidman had such a beautiful voice. When Ewan sings for the first time his voice is so powerful and beautiful you get lost in it. I love every minute of it when they sing to each other... i get so emotional. I cant stop watching Moulin Rouge...I find the love story so entrapping...it gets to me every time, especially the emotion Ewan puts into his role...or when he starts to cry at the end...I cry too. I cant get over his acting because it makes me feel like it is happening to me. Every time i watch this movie i cry...but i don't mind because it truly hold all the qualities of a great movie. I no some people don't like this movie at all...but for me at least it will ALWAYS be in my favorites collection---I cant stop watching it!My two favorite lines/ quotes from the movie: 1) ""My gift is my song...and this ones for you"" 2) ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love, and be loved in return""",Moulin Rouge!
1856,bright-light18,A masterpiece,10,16 November 2005,"This film is a crazy spontaneous mix! It's disorganized, wild and colorful. I've never seen such a spectacular mix of drama, comedy, tragedy! Never seen anything like it in my life! The music leaves you breathless. The costumes are just amazing, the decorations are impeccable and the plot line is beautiful.I was impressed by the actors. I never knew Nicole Kidman can sing...Like that! McGregor and Kidman had beautiful, amazing chemistry on screen. No one could have done it better. That was some of the best acting I've ever seen. Amazing talent! This is an excellent movie about the most beautiful feeling in the world-true love. It's not a sweet chick-flick for teenage girls, it's a tragic masterpiece!",Moulin Rouge!
1857,NiveditaIyer,An Excellent Movie,10,24 November 2005,"I loved this movie. The theme of the movie is clearly evident when the movie starts with Ewan Mcgregor typing ""the greatest thing of all is to love and be loved in return"". That line encapsulates all that the movie wants to emphasize and wants the audience to take with them. The breathtaking scenes with multitude of colors add to the vibrant nature of the movie. Nicole Kidman's exceptional acting is simply mind blowing. The themes of love, true love and the joy of loving are prominent and the Nicole-Ewan on-screen pair is perfect. The chemistry between them is just pure magic. This movie is fantabulous. The songs are not the usual time-fillers or anything but are appropriate and apt. Although against the norms of Hollywood, this movie is a beautiful piece showcasing artistic adroitness. A must watch for all who believe in Truth, beauty, freedom and love.",Moulin Rouge!
1858,nichole_curtis,This is an excellent movie,10,5 December 2005,"I first came about this movie when I was a senior in high school. My friends and I would watch this movie and we would rejoice when Christian and Satine would finally have that first kiss and we bawled like babies when Satine died.This is one of my most favorite movies ever made. I never knew until I watched this movie that Ewan Mcgregor and Nicole Kidman were such wonderful musicians.This movie captures you and holds you captive through the opening score to the last sob. I love, love, love this movie. Anyone looking for a good romance story with laughter and tears should go out and rent this movie Immediately!!!!",Moulin Rouge!
1859,notengomsn_89,One of the best movies ever.,10,30 December 2005,"I think that Moulin Rouge! has everything you could want:you can laugh,you can cry...All the performances are unbelievable but I have to say that John Leguizamo is the best.The good thing about this movie is that if you enjoy music movies you will love this one and if you do not like music movies,you will love it too.My favorite scene is the one that goes by inside the elephant when Christian and Satine sing all those ""silly love songs"",specially when they sing the bodyguard song.I also enjoyed Roxanne's tango(why does my heart cry?that is perfection)with that double scene thing.I do not know what more I can say to convince you all to see this movie,so I'll just say that the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and beloved in return.",Moulin Rouge!
1860,barbbb,i cant believe this movie,10,19 December 2005,"...this is basically for people who have already seen it......heres what i think about the characters......ewan MacGregor was amazing. i almost fell out of my seat in awe after i nearly peed my pants. i had no idea that he could sing! how wonderful life is, now that hes in the world!......nicole kid mans acting was superb, but i don't understand why she had to be singing. who said that she could sing. she is almost always off key, and her squeaker voice really annoyed me and my friends. who'd she have to sleep with to get that role? I'm glad she wasn't cast in the role as Ula in the producers......that midget guy! i don't know if you've noticed but in every single movie there is the same guy. he is famous in Hollywood without the name. every single movie that has a midget in it is played by that guy. i swear hes gonna be famous in 10 years and were all gonna be like, ""hey your that freak from Molina rouge""......the duke disappointed me, he was way too nice...so thank you for reading my comments",Moulin Rouge!

I love when in some of the music scenes it turns in to a kind of magical fantasy sorta thing. All the music in it is so addicting! I have the sound track and don't want to stop listening to it. Christine is so beautiful! And Satine is pretty... I wanted to be her. I love the ending scene! It is so beautifully done, as is the rest of the movie. They do the characters so well that you hate them, or love them, and the way the look helps a lot. The costumes were awesome, I liked all costumes, they really brought out the setting and time. It draws you in to the crazy time of Paris in the 1900's It make you laugh and cry, love it, I'd give it an 12 out of 10. must see, if you ask me.",Moulin Rouge!

I saw this movie at least 35 times literally! Its my favorite movie of all time! Perfect actors and actresses for each character! simply extraordinary! I can quote anything from the movie. i know all the words to the songs. (the main songs) I'm so happy i saw this movie in the first place. My sister bought it and liked it (she thought it was OK) then i saw it when she was at a friends house, and it sounds so stupid, but it changed my life forever... this movie introduced me to Ewan McGregor and when i found out that him and one of my favorite actresses (Nicole Kidman) sang all there songs themselves. i was blown away! Even after I've seen it over 35 times, its still the best movie! i can watch it over and over and over again! and I'm never bored! I'm not saying that I'm the movies ""bigest fan"" or whatever, I'm just saying that i love it!

I make all of my friends watch it, I even made my older brother watch it! And they've all liked it a lot. Even if you HATE chick flicks, musicals, or movies that contain prostitutes, watch it. I think you'll be surprised at what a wonderful film it is! It's a work of art! A beautiful love story, a charming comedy, and a ground breaking musical! It provides universal appeal.

1868,Jmarotos,The parallels between Moulin Rouge and Children of Paradise,9,1 March 2006,"Two movies that sit near the top of my all-time list are ""Moulin Rouge"" and the French movie, ""Children of Paradise"". The parallels between the two movies are beyond coincidence.""Children of Paradise"" was released in 1946 after WWII as two movies made out of one, primarily because of its extreme length. It was made during the Nazi occupation in France in 1945, and was set on the Boulevard of Crime in Paris, in 1820. Many of the actors were Nazi collaborators, because the Germans were oversaw the production of the movie. The French who made the movie were mostly unfriendly to the Germans so many of the actors were also members of the resistance.The two main characters, like the two main characters in ""Moulin Rouge"", include a timid, shy artist, Baptiste, and a prostitute, Garance. She becomes an actress by the direct influence of the shy artist. As the movie develops the courtesan ends up as a courtesan to a Duke, even though she is in love with the shy artist.Finally Garance rejects the Duke, in this case many years later, and goes back to the artist. They finally consummate their love, but then are tragically torn apart, once more.As with Satine in ""Moulin Rouge"", at least two other men are in love with the courtesan, Garance, and have their lives dramatically changed because of their attraction and commitment to her. Arletty, the actress who played Garance, was banned from French cinema for 10 years after the war because she was judged a Nazi collaborator. She had a relationship with a Nazi Colonel during the war. While the plots of the two movies a not exactly the same, the flavor of the movies are particularly similar. Both are set in front of and behind the stage. The action within the scenes in both movies is complex and diverse, as in a non-stop carnival. Dancers and acrobats, aristocrats and beggars fill the stages of both movies in wild celebration. Beneath the surface, within the story lines, deceit and jealousy are played with a richness seldom seen in film.Truth, beauty, freedom and love are questioned and examined, and finally, perhaps, found to be fleeting, at best.The children of Paradise lived 79 years before the children of the Revolution, yet they lived in the same place, lived the life of the theater and suffered the same agony of love. ""Children of Paradise"" is considered by many as the best film ever made in France. In 1947 it was nominated for ""Best Writing, Original Screenplay"" by the Acedamy Awards.",Moulin Rouge!
