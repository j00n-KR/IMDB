0,MartinHafer,Great Hillbilly Sci-fi!!,8,16 July 2006,"I was absolutely shocked when I saw this film, as I really expected it to be a terrible piece of trash. Instead, I was thrilled that the movie had an excellent sense of humor and never took itself seriously--and that is why it was so successful. In many ways, the film was a lot like a traditional 50s sci-fi film about an invasion that the authorities won't believe is taking place--combined with massive amounts of drugs or a head injury to give it a very weird twist! Instead of the typical victims (usually teenagers), the citizens in this Western locale are anything but! Especially the wonderful characters played by Reba McIntire and Michael Gross! They actually seem to COME ALIVE and ENJOY the invasion of these giant killer worms, as it allows them to put their very formidable arsenal to good use!! They are probably better armed than some of our National Guard units! Plus, the others, including Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon, don't just stand there and die or act like idiots from a HALLOWEEN movie, but grab guns and get to work trying to save the planet! This is a movie that really succeeds since it has real attitude and is lots of fun!",Tremors
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the sharpest and funniest monster movies in years!,10,5 May 2010,"I cannot believe how entertained I was by Tremors. As a comedy-horror it succeeds on all levels, that is in my opinion, and it is for me one of the sharpest and funniest monster movies in years. It goes at a tremendously fast pace, it is sharply written being funny and smart and the giant worms are fantastically designed. Add some skillful cinematography, lovely scenery, superb sound effects and an atmospheric score to the mix too, as well as some clever direction and some terrific acting. Fred Ward is charismatic and cool as Earl, and Kevin Bacon is really likable in his role. Rhonda is not the vapid female lead like I feared, she is intelligent and tough, and that was refreshing as was Finn Carter playing her. Out of the number of the entertaining cameos, Michael Gross comes off best as Burt, he was hilarious. Overall, enormous fun and atmospheric, and on a side note the only follow up movie of this movie I've seen so far Tremors 2 I found surprisingly entertaining for a straight-to-video sequel. 10/10 for Tremors.

2,Leofwine_draca,Top tier monster comedy is among the best of its kind,10,22 November 2016,"Now, I'm not the world's biggest fan of monster comedies. DEEP RISING left me feeling a little cold, despite the praises of other genre fans, and I absolutely hated LAKE PLACID for its routine, unfunny shtick. However, TREMORS is something different: this cult classic has so far spawned no less than three sequels and a television series, and that stands as a mark of its ensuing popularity. The movie is very funny without trying too hard to be so; much of the humour comes from Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, who reveal a natural aptitude for comedy, and who are one of the greatest double acts in movie history. Their bumbling, awkward, poorly-educated handymen are gifted creations and account for much of the film's quality.The story harks back to '50s giant monster movies, with a three act plot that closely follows those of old: unexplained deaths are followed by an explanation of the threat, culminating in a battle to the death with the giant critters. Special effects (thankfully pre-CGI, unlike the sequels) are top-notch, and the DUNE-inspired worms are great creations, full of sticky orange blood just ready to explode – you'll never stand on a worm again after watching this! The movie has fun taking the pee out of small-town American stereotypes, with Michael Gross' gun-crazy conspiracy theorist standing high as the film's most entertaining character.There is a little gore and violence here and there and the latter half of the movie is chock-full of inventive set-pieces, from the top scene where all the townsfolk are hiding out on the roofs of the town's buildings, to the escape in the JCB and trailer, and the rock pole-vaulting interlude. The suspense is gradually piled on until the riveting climax which is both hilarious and adrenaline-pumping, the perfect ending to an excellent, tongue-in-cheek, humble monster-cum-comedy movie that stands as the best of its kind.",Tremors
3,SnoopyStyle,Great B-movie horror,8,19 October 2013,"A small isolated desert community comes under attack from underground monsters. Valentine McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Fred Ward) are two poor handymen. Rhonda LeBeck (Finn Carter) is a seismology student. And the hardcore survivalists Gummers (Michael Gross, Reba McEntire) are just some of the town residents.This is Jaws on land. It is perfectly made by people who obviously know and love horror movies. The monsters are dole out slowly, first as a suggestion, then as glimpses, and finally reveal for the shock. There is top notch workmanship. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward have great energy. They have the humor and the likability. More importantly, they have great chemistry together. Great actors in classic characters with a terrific premise, everything is there for a great movie. And the execution is perfect.",Tremors
4,kosmasp,Moving - and the best comedy duo(?),8,29 July 2020,"Now I always had heard about Tremors, but never had seen any of them. And boy are there a lot of them. Especially since the Tremors got revived for a double whammy a few years ago. What did surprise me watching this, how violent it was. I don't have a problem with that as you can see, I still was surprised at how evil that creature (or creatures) was.What I did know, was that Kevin Bacon was a part of this. And while he doesn't seem to reprise his roles ever (apparently he never was asked or got the right script or something), he seems to have done something for the TV show this spawned a few years ago. Did not watch this. So I only watched the currently 6 movies that exist, the first one and the 5 sequels (or rather 4 sequels and one prequel).This should about tell you everything there is to know. Apart from the fact that Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward really carry this movie. Great chemistry, great humor, mixed with ""animal"" horror. How does that sound? Well you answered your own question if it is something worth your while ...",Tremors
5,lee_eisenberg,Beware the desert...,7,5 January 2006,"I will say that ""Tremors"" wasn't quite as good as ""The Day of the Triffids"", but it was certainly worth seeing. In the small town of Perfection, Nevada, Val McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Fred Ward) are planning to leave town when giant worms start attacking the town from below, forcing the townspeople to have to figure out how to fight back.It sounds kind of silly, but director Ron Underwood knows how to pull it off. A previous reviewer noted that one good aspect is that you never know when or where the worms are going to attack - sort of like the shark in ""Jaws"". This is certainly one of those good sci-fi/horror films that pops up once in a while as a counterbalance to the ridiculous ones (""The Brain from Planet Arous"" (1957) was also one such movie). Also starring are Victor Wong, Reba McEntire, and Ariana Richards (who later played Lex in ""Jurassic Park""). Check it out if possible.",Tremors
6,jboothmillard,Tremors,8,18 October 2010,"I had heard one or two people say this was really good, and the critics give it five stars, so I gave it a go, from director Ron Underwood (City Slickers, Mighty Joe Young, Pluto Nash). Basically odd-job handymen Valentine 'Val' McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Road Trip's Fred Ward) have travelled to the desert town of Perfection, Nevada trying to find work being in a dead-end state. Soon enough strange things start happening starting with some minor earthquakes monitored by university student Rhonda LeBeck (Finn Carter) studying seismographs, and then some bodies pop up. Val and Earl come across a large creepy worm-like creature with living and biting tentacles, and they soon realise that it isn't just the one. These creatures, or monsters are beneath the residents feet burrowing under the ground, and they catch their victims from their vibrations, or tremors, above ground. Knowing the danger from the four remaining monsters reaching at least thirty feet long, and with shop owner Walter Chang (Victor Wong) giving them the name ""Graboids"", the humans take refuge above ground on the roofs of the buildings. Even above ground the humans aren't avoiding danger, because the monsters are learning fast, but they can be diverted into believing any vibration above ground to be food. In the end, Val, Earl, Rhonda and the other remaining survivors trick and kill all the creatures, blowing them up, shooting them, and sending them off cliffs. Also starring Michael Gross as Burt Gummer, Reba McEntire as Heather Gummer, Robert Jayne, or Bobby Jacoby as Melvin Plug, Charlotte Stewart as Nancy Sterngood, Tony Genaro as Miguel, Ariana Richards as Mindy Sterngood, Richard Marcus as Nestor and Sunshine Parker as Edgar. Bacon and Ward do really well as the heroic losers, the monsters when they appear do their stuff, and this is quite a good spoof of the old B-movies, so it is a comedy horror to see. Very good!",Tremors
7,ccthemovieman-1,"This Keeps Your Attention, I'll Say That!",8,5 October 2006,"This is a scary movie with good suspense-horror and excellent special-effects as huge worm-like creatures go after humans in the desert. It kind of sounds like one of those hokey 1950s sci-fi films but it isn't. This can scare you at times. The only negative, at least for me, was an excessive abuse of the Lord's name in vain. There is a ton of profanity in here and some dumb dialog. You have to put with that - or use a profanity filter - but, for sheer suspense for an hour-and-a-half, this has it in spades. The story is involving. Once you get hooked, you can't put this film down.Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross and Reba McIntyre fight off the gruesome underground invaders.One thing for sure: you will not be bored.",Tremors

9,Quinoa1984,a childhood favorite and a not-guilty pleasure,8,23 June 2016,"Tremors was the kind of monster movie that seemed to find its way into my childhood video library - was it meant for kids, I have no idea (it's not not meant for them, if that makes sense) - and it was something that got repeat viewing. I think it was because the tone was sharp for this kind of material. The filmmakers had more of a budget than something like a Japanese Godzilla movie, and the actors, including people like Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, are not taking a s*** so to speak, they're not there just to collect a paycheck (or if they are, they hide ir so well that you don't notice).The pacing is what keeps things tense and breakneck. The premise is simple: underground worms chase and hunt down townspeople in the tiny Perfection, Nevada. There's enough character in the set-ups with these people first though, with Bacon and Ward as laborers, and with the townspeople (Michael Gross and Victor Wong get some ample screen-time), and it helps that the filmmakers spend just enough time in the first ten-fifteen minutes so that we can care enough about them while also making them fairly comic characters.This is a fun movie. It doesn't have much pretension or things in the way to make it draw too much attention to it being ""art"". It's a killer-worms movie that gets some build-up early on for the what these worms are - first it's snakes and then it's the GIANT worm that's attached to everything and then when it gets going. And the special effects mostly hold up well with everything being practical effects. If you are inundated with CGI and don't remember a time when effects got to be MADE, not simply on a computer, with things moving quickly underground at people and shooting out of the ground with guns blazing at it and with gore flying everywhere. It's glorious work by talented craftsmen.So watch it knowing that it's funny, wild and made with energy and some clever characters (a couple being gun nuts, plus Reba McEntire!)",Tremors
10,wes-connors,Get Off the Ground!,8,14 January 2009,"The tiny city of ""Perfection, Nevada"" suddenly finds its population of 14 dwindling, as under-employed handymen Kevin Bacon (as Valentine ""Val"" McKee) and Fred Ward (as Earl Bassett) decide to hit the road. Before heading to nearby ""Bixby"", they meet perky student seismologist Finn Carter (as Rhonda LeBeck). Ms. Carter is studying an odd abundance of seismic ""Tremors"" in the vicinity. Driving on, Mr. Bacon and Mr. Ward discover giant mole-like slug creatures are eating all animals (including people, of course) in the area. They high-tail it back to town and, with the remaining citizens, try to avoid becoming food for slugs.Director Ron Underwood, with writers S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock, creates a great balance of humor, suspense, and horror show ""homage"". The flesh-eating ""graboids"" are a great ""monster"" - but, the real success in ""Tremors"" is the dignified performances of the cast, led by Bacon's keenly characterized ""Valentine"". Bacon, Ward, and the others play the cartoonish characters with wit rather than foolishness. As usual, the excitement is enhanced when the characters are appealing. Michael Gross and Reba McEntire (as Burt and Heather Gummer) are an absolute hoot. ******** Tremors (1990) Ron Underwood ~ Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter",Tremors
11,BandSAboutMovies,Always fun,6,18 January 2021,"Ron Underwood has had a pretty good directing career, with this as his first film, although he was an AD on Tourist Trap. His career is all over the place genre-wise, with City Slickers, Hearts and Souls and Mighty Joe Young doing well before The Adventures of Pluto Nash failed. He's since done well in TV, directing episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Boston Legal and Fear the Walking Dead. And, like nearly every horror director from the 80's, he's put out several holiday movies such as Santa Baby, The Year Without a Santa Claus and Holiday In Handcuffs.Valentine ""Val"" McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Fred Ward) are sick of life in Perfection, Nevada. They decide to leave town for Bixby, the closest big city, but are stopped when they find the body of Edgar Deems up in a tower, dead from dehydration. Before you know it, they're under assault by gigantic worms called Graboids and working with seismology student Rhonda LeBeck (Finn Carter, How I Got Into College) and survivalists Burt and Heather (Michael Gross and Reba McEntire) to figure out how to survive.There's a great supporting cast on hand, like John Carpenter stock actor Victor Wong as a general store owner, Bobby Jacoby, Ariana Richards (who battled even bigger creatures in two Jurassic Park movies and the third sequel to this series, too), Charlotte Stewart (Mary X in Eraserhead and Bettie Briggs on Twin Peaks) and Bibi Besch (The Pack, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan).This movie did just OK in theaters before becoming a rental and cable success. It was such a big deal that it has since become an entire series of films, including 1996's Tremors 2: Aftershocks (Fred Ward came back, as does Michael Gross), 2001's Tremors 3: Back to Perfection (Gross stays on and Ariana Richards comes back) and the 2004 prequel Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, which is set in 1889 and has Gross playing the role of Hiram Gummer, Burt's great grandfather. These films were all made by the original creative team of Underwood, Brent Maddock and S. S. Wilson.Eleven years later, Universal made Tremors 5: Bloodlines with an all-new cast and crew, save Gross. That movie was followed by Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell, which brought back Jamie Kennedy as Burt's son Travis and Gross and last year's Tremors: Shrieker Island, which closes out Burt's battles against the Graboids, Dirt Dragons, Ass-Dragons and Shriekers. There was also a TV series as well that aired on SyFy and a pilot for a new series was made in 2017 but wasn't bought.Before making this movie, Kevin Bacon really thought his career was over. He screamed to his pregnant wife Kyra Sedgwick, ""I can't believe I'm doing a movie about underground worms!'"" But by the end of the movie, he'd admit that making Tremors was the most fun he'd had in his entire career. As for Gross, he basically walked off the set of the last episode of Family Ties and on to the desert location for this movie.",Tremors
12,Coventry,Giant Worms...great fun !!,10,29 May 2003,"Perfection, Nevada is a very small desert town with a population of 14 people. The two handymen in town, Valentine McKee and Earl Basset, do annoying jobs for everybody and they are sick of it. They decide to move to the bigger town, Bixby. When they're finally set to leave, a lot of strange things seem to happen and every person between Perfection and Bixby were slaughtered in a brutal way. Together with a geography student, Rhonda, they discover what seems to be the problem. 4 giant worms (with slugs coming out of their mouth as sort of tentacles ) are under the ground of Perfection. The whole population of Perfection Valley is in danger cause how to fight an enemy below you ? They hear every vibration and swallow a whole person without a problem. But Val en Earl are planning to fight back and together with Rhonda and Burt and Heather ( a couple with more guns and explosives than the American army ) they find some very original ways to kill what they called the ""Graboids"" themselves.This film has everything. The story reminds you of the good old-fashioned monster flicks from the 50's and 60's. with the modern special effects and make up the monsters are very lively and a pleasure to watch to. The script is full of humor (Especially the conversations between Val en Earl are hilarious most of the time)and the acting performances are more than good. Followed by a 2 sequels so far.

Pulses start pounding when the town is terrorized by the cause of the powerful vibrations...earth worm-like creatures that measure 30 foot long. A little off beat and quirky. Sometimes a bit silly and very light on intelligent dialogue. FX are pretty darn good and this comedic Sci-Fi will get you to squirming.Fighting off these huge crawlers are Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Michael Gross and country music warbler Reba McEntire.

15,hitchcockthelegend,This valley is just one long smörgåsbord.,8,6 June 2009,"Finally deciding to break free of their small town existence, handymen Val and Earl find that it's easier said than done. The reason? Giant underground worms are attacking the place and they are now needed more than ever.The 50s ream of sci-fi schlockers and creaky creature features are, depending on your persuasion, either genius fun or tacky nuisances. Since I belong to the first group, Tremors is possibly one of the finest homages to a most wonderful time in cinema. What is often ignored is that those 50s film's deal with the paranoia of the time, with nuclear testing and a wondering appertaining to Roswell like alien visits being very prominent in honest Joe's thoughts. So it be that Tremors is ideally set out in the desert, a place from where all manner of terrifying things have come forward to announce a threat to the American way of life.We are in the small town of Perfection, a place that may be small on residents, but very much large on character. We have dim wits, annoying kid, cutesy single mom types, Mr and Mrs Rambo and courtesy of Finn Carter's seismologist Rhonda LeBeck, a romantic and charmingly fun filled thread. Containing dashes of gore and reams of cheeky suspense, Tremors proudly wears its ""B"" movie heart on its sleeve. While in Fred Ward (Earl) and Kevin Bacon (Val) the genre possibly has its greatest pairing. As male buddy buddy combos go, these pair take the cake. Funny and full of devilish derring do, Tremors deserves to be watched for this partnership if nothing else - yes they are that good! The creatures are well designed and prove to be a scary and enjoyable foe, whilst the Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, California location is perfectly utilised by cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski. Directed by Ron Underwood on his feature film debut, Tremors also sees Reba McEntire, Michael Gross and Victor Wong also along for this fun packed ride. 8/10",Tremors
16,Theo Robertson,Affectionate Homage To 50s B Movies,7,30 October 2005,"Watching TREMORS is like watching one of those sci-fi/horror B movies from the 1950s , specifically one you enjoyed as a child and still watch as an adult . In short TREMORS is a very likable movie Set in the of Perfection in the isolated desert of Neveda the story is carried by two good ole' American boys Valentine Mckee and Earl Bassett who stumble across the body of an associate who has strangely died of dehydration and they soon realise that instead of taking care of the mystery , the mystery will soon be taking care of them and the other inhabitants of Perfection I notice this has been described as "" a comedy horror "" or "" a horror spoof "" but this is totally misleading because TREMORS is an affectionate tribute to the sci-fi movies of the 1950s and where else except a sci-fi 50s movie would monsters mutated by atomic radiation be stalking humans ? This makes the plot somewhat derivative and it also owes a lot to JAWS and in many ways the working title of LAND SHARKS would be more accurate but if you're after 90 minutes of affable entertainment more than succeeds in biting the target",Tremors
17,jotix100,Monsters under ground,8,4 April 2005,"Not having seen this enormously pleasing film before, we decided to take a look at it recently. Ron Underwood has done the impossible with the talented people under his direction. He has created a film that takes us back to earlier years when this genre was more popular. It's Mr. Underwood fortune to have been able to get an intelligent script that scares our wits, and at the same time, it gives the viewer ninety minutes of wonderful escape.One can't think of another pair playing the leading roles in ""Tremors"", but Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. These talented performers bring a lot of energy to the film. The goofy duo of Valentine and Earl are well balanced. They are totally credible as the resourceful men that are able to get rid of the gigantic menaces crawling under the surface of the Nevada desert, so sensible to any movement on the surface that they will destroy everything in their way.The rest of the performers are good. Michael Gross and Reba McEntire play Burt and Heather, a couple with so much powerful weapons at their disposal, they are invincible.Watching this film without any expectations paid up in more ways than we thought would be possible. As someone mentioned in a comment, this film has all the potential of becoming a cult film, as it will be a favorite of many fans of these types of movies.",Tremors
18,Hey_Sweden,It doesn't matter where they come from!,8,11 July 2012,"It's easy to see how the engaging monster movie ""Tremors"" could win over an audience. It's the kind of movie that both gently pokes fun at, and pays homage to, its inspiration. In this case, it's the creature features of the 1950s. Many impressive elements come together to create a successful whole; everything just works here.The story has the people of a very small desert community menaced by enormous underground predators that just appear out of the blue, with no clue as to their origins. The characters can speculate, sure, but how and why these things exist isn't nearly as important as how to outwit and destroy them. Leading the charge against the beasts are amiable handymen Val and Earl (Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, who share a marvelous chemistry), two guys who had been planning to leave for the big city - or the nearest town of any size.The movie is by turns suspenseful, action packed, and humorous, with an enjoyably quirky bunch of characters for whom we can easily root. The movie is cast to Perfection: country & western darling Reba McEntire (making an unlikely but endearing movie debut) and 'Family Ties' dad Michael Gross make for a highly amusing survivalist couple, Victor Wong (""Big Trouble in Little China"", ""Prince of Darkness"") lends his appealing, eccentric presence to the role of the local shop keeper, cute & appealing Finn Carter, who could easily have had a bigger career in film after this, is shapely seismology student Rhonda, and Charlotte Stewart (""Eraserhead"") and Ariana Richards (""Jurassic Park"") are a local mom & daughter.The music is excellent, the photography has an appropriately sun baked look to it, and the creatures themselves are convincingly created by the talented effects team of Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr. They're big, ugly, smelly, slimy things with mouths that open up like flowers, and can move through the dirt like nobody's business. The dialogue has its fair share of quotable lines, delivered with gusto by the cast. The capable direction is by Ron Underwood, making a solid feature debut.The concept definitely proved to be an enduring one, as a series of direct-to-home-video sequels and a short lived series have followed. ""Tremors"" continues to hold up well on repeat viewings, with enjoyment of its laughs and thrills unaffected by familiarity.

One day they decide enough is enough, pack their things into their truck & head for a better life.

Together with seismologist Rhonda LeBeck (Finn Carter) & her equipment they come to the conclusion that these creatures are headed straight for Perfection whose population is rapidly decreasing...Directed by Ron Underwood I thought Tremors was a great way to pass 90 odd minutes. The script by producers S.S. Wilson & Brent Maddock is an affectionate homage to all those giant monster films from the 50's & 60's, Tremors moves along at a nice pace & it never becomes either dull or boring as our human cast have to outwit the giant worms & stay alive. Tremors never takes itself seriously & is also quite light-hearted with various one-liners & jokes although some of Val & Earl's dialogue is pretty humorous as well plus they have a good on screen chemistry. The character's are a little clichéd, the good looking hero, the attractive female, the annoying kid & a store owner but they are all given a bit more life & depth than usual. My one real complaint is that Tremors seems to be trying to cater to the younger teen audience with an almost inevitable happy ending & a sense that nothing will happen that's going to shock or surprise. With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 Tremors has some nice special effects with the worm creatures looking suitably monstrous & impressive, there isn't much in the way of blood or gore just a few splats of blood, some mutilated sheep & some exploding worms. It is well made throughout with nice cinematography that capture the expanse of the desert valley locations, good music & has that Hollywood polish too it. The acting is pretty good especially from Bacon & Ward who make this film although Michael Gross & Reba McEntire as the over-the-top gun toting survivalists Burt & Heather Gummer descend into annoying silliness a bit too often. Personally I think Tremors is well worth watching especially if your a horror fan but also those just looking for something fast paced, fun, entertaining & doesn't take itself seriously should find something here to enjoy, I reckon you should give it a go.",Tremors

What ensues now are a series of entertaining escapades as the two, with newly arrived seismologist ""Rhonda"" (Finn Carter) and the townsfolk try to stay one step ahead of their voracious pursuers. It's a bit of a slow burn at the start, but once we get down to the nitty gritty, Ron Underwood keeps the action flowing well with a lively script and some personable efforts from all concerned. It's enjoyable, this film, with some engaging performances - especially the ""Gummer"" pairing of Michael Gross and Reba McEntire who have enough weaponry to start and win WWIII - and it doesn't rely overly on complicated visual effects. On that front it is more reminiscent of a Hammer film! Everyone looks like they enjoyed making this, and that's contagious, so sit back and watch it bring a smile to your face.",Tremors
22,utgard14,"""Who died and made you Einstein?""",8,19 July 2014,"An isolated desert town finds itself under attack from gigantic underground worm-like creatures. One of the best movies to come out of the '90s. A horror-comedy with a great cast, special effects, and script. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are wonderful. They have a terrific chemistry together.

23,Boba_Fett1138,Simply a great movie within its genre.,7,15 March 2010,"This is not really a movie that stands out with its brilliance but it's one that is greatly fun to watch.This was obviously not a very expensive movie to make but I must say that they did a great job with its budget and resources. They are being quite creative, by staying mostly old fashioned. All of the creature effects are not spectacular but they are simply good and effective looking. This is basically just the case with the entire movie.They kept things simply for this movie with its story, that works out mostly effective because the movie itself doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie is foremost being a comedy, making this movie a very entertaining and fun one to watch. It also has some good horror, not in terms of its scares or gore but more with its build up and main premise. The movie also truly benefits from it that it's entirely being set in a small and isolated desert town, with a small bunch of misfits living in it. They keep things lively and fun and prevents the movie from starting to repeat itself. Even though in essence the movie really isn't an original one, the execution of it all still makes this a very original and greatly watchable movie within its genre.It's really great that Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are in this. They are an unlikely screen-duo but it works out surprisingly fun and natural. Both show to have some great comical talent as well, next to the right acting skills. All of the other characters are great in this as well and as a matter of fact I don't think there was not a single character in this movie which I didn't remotely disliked.A great and above all greatly fun genre movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Tremors

Unlike Jay-Z's dis of Nas, ""Dune"" wasn't ""usin' it wrong,"" ""Tremors"" just used it differently and more expansively.""Dune"" introduced the world to subterranean sandworms that hunt by detecting sound in '84. In 1990 ""Tremors"" gave us scaled down versions of the sandworms that operate in the same manner and are no less frightening. Earl (Fred Ward), Valentine (Kevin Bacon), and the few residents of Perfection, Nevada found themselves being held hostage by these underground monsters.

The lords of the underground were a new kind of creature to deal with. Even though the situation was serious the movie kept it light. The entire production was top shelf.

One of the best exploits here is the fact that this one really takes it's PG-13 rating in stride and doesn't really feel like a harder film toned down for the rating. From the humorous quips that are genuinely funny to the slapstick-style gore in favor of rough and violent bloodletting, having high-impact scares in a setting like this would feel really out-of-place but gives it a remarkably campy-yet-watchable feel, especially once the monsters make their entrance. With the two stages evident here and only providing an appropriate segue into the later scenes after a marginally creepy first half mystery about the true source of the disappearances, the appropriate feel to their small-time desert town and a thoroughly enjoyable action-packed series of scenes in the later half, it's got a lot to like about it but it does have a problem or two, namely in the fact that it's so cheesy and campy at times that it's hard to take it seriously. While it's not detrimental at all, it could be enough to throw it down a peg for some who find the concept and execution pretty cheesy, which could happen.

They play a couple of friends living in a very small town in the middle of nowhere.  There only wish is to get out of this place and get somewhere big, unfortunately something big is just under their feet.

They seemed to have chased an old man up a power line where he died of thirst, then they take out a farmer and his livestock, and then they take out these two working on the side of the road.  This movie is rather bloody considering it is a pg-13 movie.  The town meets and we are introduced to more colorful characters like the survivalist couple, the stingy grocery owner, and the annoying kid who loves to play a prank or two.

The cast is spirited and likable while the creatures are inventive and interesting. Unfortunately, they're also unbelievable since the hard desert ground would have to have the texture of thick mud for these behemoths to so easily travel through.If you can overlook this, however, it's a fun monster flick with magnificent desert cinematography. Yet it's nothing more than that and so plays tediously on repeat viewings. ""Gargoyles"" is all-around superior because it's more cryptic, grave and streamlined.Finn Carter is a highlight in a girl-next-door kind of way, particularly her brief de-panted scene (lol).

30,The_Void,"Giant underground worms, a barrel of laughs and some very nifty special effects - monster movie masterclass!",10,30 October 2005,"Tremors was one of my all time favourite movies as a kid, but since then; only my nostalgia for the film has remained. Upon seeing the film for the first time as an adult, it immediately hit me that I had great taste even as a child. Despite being an overblown and silly monster movie at heart - Tremors is a damn good film. The thing about Tremors that stands out the most is definitely the special effects. While none of them are particularly impressive individually - together, they combine to brilliantly create the illusion that the small town of 'Perfection' really is under attack from giant subterranean worms! Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward take the lead roles as a couple of handymen, living out of a truck, that decide they want to move up in the world. A local, and larger, town is their desired destination; but before they can exit Perfection, they uncover a lot of strange events. Severed heads in a pool of blood, a dehydrated man atop a telephone tower and, best of all, a car that's been dragged underground - radio still playing! Along with a college student called Rhonda, it doesn't take our heroes long to realise that their quiet Nevada town is infested with giant underground worms! The main reason why Tremors works so well is because it follows the same plot formula as the classic monster movies such as 'Them!'. This makes the film predictable; but when the plotting is this much fun, it really doesn't matter. Adding massively to the entertainment value are the two leading men. Their conversations are constantly funny, and ensure that the film is never boring for a second. Typically for this sort of film; almost all of the residents of Perfection like to spend their spare time doing things that make vibrations - bouncing basket balls, driving tractors, playing with pogo sticks etc; but even this unlikely situation can be forgiven due to the extreme good nature of the movie. The characters on display are really great, the best of them being Burt Gummer, played by Michael Gross. Complete with his basement full of guns and wife who's just as nuts as him; Gross steals every scene he's in. Something that's often ignored in films like this is the writing. Writers S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock have put together an excellent story, complete with all the suspense, inventiveness and laughs that you could ever want. On the whole, Tremors is a cut above the average monster flick!",Tremors
31,Mr-Fusion,"""Who died and made you Einstein? """,8,11 November 2021,"One thing I did not expect with Tremors - its premise implying a certain cheap amusement - is unbridled *enthusiasm*. Here you have a throwback monster movie populated with well-defined characters and a script full of setup and payoff, apparently made by people who are enjoying their work. If it were easy to pull off a dumb movie that goes about its entertainment with thought and purpose, everybody would be doing it. And yet, here we have cowboys and gun nuts saving the town from subterranean demon worms. And it's a blast.A huge part of the reason is its main characters. I love Valentine and Earl; two dissatisfied handymen stuck in jerkwater, USA; they're unlikely heroes but take their flesh-eating predicament somewhat in stride. It's because Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward have an easy chemistry, always solving disagreements with rock-paper-scissors (a comedic gesturing that always had me laughing). I can't imagine living with these guys would be easy, but I kinda want them around in times of crisis.I can't recommend this movie highly enough, it's beautifully paced, simple and above all: a lot of fun!",Tremors
32,SimonJack,It keeps things hopping and jumping in the country,7,23 July 2018,"Unless one watches a documentary on the making of this film, one will never know where they came from. The ""they"" are the underground, fast-burrowing monsters that are tearing up the countryside in this film. And eating man and animals alike. ""Tremors"" provides a new twist, with a new creature for sci-fi films. The questions are asked throughout the film. Why are they here? Where did they come from? But there never is an answer. And that's okay. The cast are all quite good. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward provide most of the humor, though it may seem forced by the mores and standards of the 21st century. The film has a good fright factor, although a mix of comedy from the lead characters keeps it from ever getting to the horror stage, And that's okay. But for the frequent use of crass language and occasional profanity, this would be an okay film for the whole family. Generally, this is an entertaining film that many people should enjoy.

Yet, as cheesy as it is, I watch it with a lot of pleasure every time I catch it on TV and that's saying a lot! I usually never watch a movie twice. So for this reason alone I should rate it 10/10, but there is more. It's the perfect film for its era and has stood the test of time again and again, which is quite amazing for a movie released thirty years ago.Also out of nostalgia, I watched all the sequels to the film. They're not really worth watching, but the original one is the real deal and having watched a video analysis of it from Critical Drinker I will have to agree with it: the script is pure gold. It never misses a beat, it doesn't add anything superfluous, it doesn't force people to do things out of character just to further the plot and it changes the genre of the scenes based on what was achieved until then - the script adapts to the plot! You get buddy comedy, horror, action and social commentary at exactly the right times and it all feels natural.Bottom line: if you could bottle movie fun, it would have a Tremors label on it!",Tremors
34,StevePulaski,A well-developed entry in the overlooked 'weird west' genre,9,10 April 2011,"The way Ron Underwood's Tremors builds, foreshadows imminent events, and plays with its wide variety of eccentric characters is something that often gets overlooked in the face of obvious fun and lighthearted nature of the film. Beyond basic cable entertainment, however, there is a seriously sturdiness and intelligence to the way the film operates that I've admired since I was a young child, at one point, watching each film of the franchise (all except for the fourth film) and a daily basis; it's a film written with the kind of thoughtfulness that's rare for B-movies of any era, especially the 1990's, when they were already becoming an extinct breed. The film revolves around Valentine and Earl (Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward), a likable pair of smartass handymen, who curse the sleepy desert-town of Perfection, Nevada, where they've spent most of their days. They're sick of the laborious work that offer little pay in return, and both men find one anothers mannerisms and sentiments contemptible, despite the fact that, at the end of the day, they're really all they got. Just when they come to the conclusion that they will ditch deserted Perfection for the more promising land of Bixby, strange and rampant deaths of notable townfolk become apparent: the alcoholic electrician is found dead from dehydration on top of an electric pole, a herd of sheep and their farmer are all killed by a mysterious force, and two roadworkers are mysteriously found dead on their jobsite. Val and Earl are convinced a killer is on the loose, but before they can back up their assertion, they discover an unidentified species of subterranean worm. The worm, which makes use of its three or four smaller tongue-like worms inside of its mouth to grab hold of its victims, hunts by sound and sonic vibrations, making up for its inability to see and smell. They can travel at incredibly speeds and usually manage to elevate the entire ground before breaking onto the surface, screeching in an attempt to alert its presence.The entire film feels like a National Geographic TV show gone horribly awry, as Val and Earl enlist in the help of their close friends and fellow Perfection residents like the known survivalist, World War III-prepper Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and his wife Heather (Reba McEntire), in addition to helpless store owner Walter Chang (Victor Wong), to bring down the worms. There's also a grad- school-age seismologist named Rhonda (Finn Carter), who has been monitoring seismic activity and been receiving extremely alarming results, which, upon discovery, bring no surprise.The result is a nonstop parade of terrifically suspenseful action setpieces, with tense elements of horror placed in for good measure, as well as pleasant humor from the likes of Bacon and Ward. Tremors, above all, however, is an immensely well-structured film, working to build suspense and naturally foreshadow events in the very beginning of the film, doing so in a way that's not entirely obvious nor trivial and tacked-on. Consider a little girl's pogostick, Walter Chang's new cooler, or Burt's underground bunker, all of which subtle and very believable story inclusions that go on to assume greater significance as the film develops. The comedic elements are also balanced very neatly with the more horror-driven elements; consider the opening scene, when we see all that we need to in efforts to define the relationship between Val and Earl. It's the telling state of their friendships, filled with quips, pranks, and mindless bickers settled by one round of rock, paper, scissors. With any other actors or under a script that is far inferior to the balanced and cheerful one that S.S. Wilson has penned, these could've been two insufferable blokes with not a shred of wit or chemistry. With the likable traits Wilson gives them and with the affable, relatable nature Bacon and Ward bring to the characters, the two souls click almost instantly.Finally, there are the action elements, which also work incredibly well. Underwood, Wilson, and the remainder of the cast are essentially given an entire Nevadan desert to play in, which warrants results that aren't locationally confined nor are they limiting, given the wealth of possibilities they could offer. We spend enough time riding horseback with Val and Earl, sitting on rocks with the gang of townfolk, sitting inside Chang's general store, and even a brief few minutes inside Burt and Heather's bunker, where one of the film's best scenes occurs, that the location-variety is exhaustive and all-encompassing. This results in a film that's very fluid and fun, never stopping and sitting for too long and never forgetting its true purpose - to have fun and create a well-developed film about bizarre creatures.Tremors goes down as one of the strangest, yet most unabashedly enjoyable, pieces of 'weird west' I have yet to see. It was a film I grew up on, appreciating its originality at first, but growing to love the smaller, more low-key elements in the film working with the more obvious ones to, in turn, create a film that's layered and exhilarating, all while operating on the scale of a B-movie. Call it whatever word you want - I call it ingenuous and developed.Starring: Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross, Reba McEntire, and Victor Wong. Directed by: Ron Underwood.",Tremors

It's a monster movie that doesn't focus on the fear and gore elements but more on the fun elements. Where a group of people in Nevada that lives near a small desert area. Has to fight off giant worm like creatures underneath that eats humans. I think the idea came because of a group of kids playing a game where they have to stay on platforms. And away from touching the ground and the kids that touched the ground either becomes one of the infected or eliminated from the game. What this is, isn't a psychological terror or anything like that, but a fun filled movie with fun characters trying to survive. While also trying to fight back with the resources they have and outwit the giant man-eating worms. What I appreciate about this movie, is that although it might go slightly overboard. It doesn't try to be more than what it is. So if you want to watch a fun low-budget movie with a group of friends or even with the whole family, this one might lead to a somewhat enjoyable time.7/10",Tremors
37,sddavis63,A Fun Ride With A Good Cast,7,20 July 2011,"""Tremors"" is a little bit of everything. It's got a wonderful composite cast (headed by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, but very much a team effort with a great supporting team), at times it's quite funny, it does a pretty good job of being suspenseful (although I wouldn't really call it scary) and it keeps you watching all the way through. Best of all - although a bit of romance pops up in the end - it avoids the trap of trying to blend a love story in with everything else all the way through and sticks pretty closely to what the meat of the story is.Perfection is a small, isolated town somewhere in the desert. A geology student doing research (played by Finn Carter) detects strange seismic activity just outside the town and people and cattle start to mysteriously die, sometimes dismembered in the process. Finally, we discover that strange, previously unknown, subterranean creatures are popping up all around Perfection, devouring whatever they find. This movie avoids the unnecessary - it doesn't try to turn itself into a sci- fi movie, with explanations of what the creatures are or where they came from. The creatures are left as a mystery - they're just there, and the townsfolk have to find a way to survive. This remains a horror-comedy all the way through. It never takes itself too seriously and all of the characters have a certain quirkiness about them (although all come across as believable and realistic in the circumstances, and therefore interesting to the viewer.) So the story was well-written and well thought out. It satisfies in the end.I thought that Bacon and Ward made a great team. They played off and complemented each other well. Finn Carter was a great choice as the student geologist. She played the part seriously and was taken seriously; the movie avoiding the temptation to simply turn the character into the object of anyone's attention. She's the major secondary member of the cast, although Michael Gross as Burt was also able to steal a few scenes.The creatures are interesting - like nothing I've ever seen in a movie before, and - as I mentioned - left appropriately unexplained.

Essentially, it's 'Jaws (1974)' set in an American desert ('Sand Sharks' was literally one of the titles considered before the filmmakers settled on the seismic sensation). However, it doesn't feel like a rip-off, even though it hits many of the same beats - including a death scene that's almost identical to one seen in Spielberg's water-based classic. Most of the characters feel like rounded individuals, regardless of the amount of dialogue and general screen-time they're given; you really get the sense of community among Perfection's relatively tiny amount of residents. This keeps you invested in the action, especially since seemingly anyone can die at any moment, and it leads to a satisfying sense of camaraderie as the thing moves into its final third. The film's subterranean terrors are well-designed and suitably sinister. They make the movie's set-pieces all rather unique because they're smart and they can't be dealt with by sheer brute force alone. In general, the piece milks quite a bit of suspense out of its central situation. It's well-paced, too. It's just an enjoyable time throughout. Of course, it's not the most thematically rich or, even, generally captivating experience. It's a B-movie, though and through. That's not a bad thing, really.

40,g-bodyl,A Fun B-Movie!,8,16 June 2015,"Tremors is actually quite a fun B-movie, typical of your usual early-90's flair. It's a film that has something for everybody. It has some good sci-fi action, plenty of comedy thanks to the two bumbling leads, a rather unique and horrific creature design, and this film resembles a mini disaster movie and that is a good thing. I also liked how this film is not flat-out horror. Sure there are some chills, but there is enough action and comedy to combat the horror elements of the film.Ron Underwood's film is about these two men named Val and Earl who are out working in a isolated town called Perfection located in Nevada. Things go awry when these mysterious snake-like creatures emerge from the depths to terrify the inhabitants and now escape is made impossible.I thought the acting was pretty good. Kevin Bacon does a solid job as Val and likewise Fred Ward for Earl. They both show excellent chemistry with each other. Their performances are in part why this film works. Despite being in moments of horror, I like how they try to be funny and most of the time it works.Overall, Tremors is a solid, B-movie that delivers on its promise of a good time. This is the kind of film that made 90's cinema so good. It's not designed to be an award-worthy film, although the film does have many good reviews.

Listen to Bacon say 'Motherhumper'. What is that supposed to mean? The idea behind the film is interesting as some scenes and events are quite entertaining but the execution of most of it really lame and amateur. The dialogue is quite bad throughout.

They don't even bother to give us an explanation.Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a great duo. Although the characters they play hate their lifestyles it seems pretty cool to me. Although I do realize it was made in 1989 it seems very 80's. The girlfriend of Kevin Bacon is entirely responsible for this. She kind of annoyed me too. Her attempts at being smart and witty just do not work. But Michael Gross was cool as Burt. I like how he is gung-ho without being irritating. It's hard to be gung-ho without getting on my nerves. Also, the smart-ass little kid who always whines is funny. The death scenes could have been a little more graphic but the fast pace of the plot after it gets going makes up for it.

Its almost like watching a 'how to' special effects show.The movie itself is very 80's with almost an adventure feel to it (by way of presentation) like Goonies, the acting and the effects are sort of cartoonish.
Does it work for the film? Absolutely. Unless they decided to go full horror/gore, I think the style they went with is about the only one that would work for the movie. Its meant to be a bit silly and over the top.
An entertaining film for sure, would love to see a super scary, dark version though!",Tremors
50,digitalbeachbum,It's a fun movie,8,5 June 2020,"OK. It doesn't matter where they came from, it doesn't matter that they seem to travel at great speeds underground, and it doesn't matter than they are carnivores. This movie is supposed to be fun and light.Tremors is one of the movies I remember seeing because I liked Kevin Bacon. I didn't care about the story at first, but then I got in to the cult following. The movie didn't do so well in the box office.The movie is supposed to be funny. It wasn't a big money production.There is some language, no nudity, lots of gratuitous violence.If you like alien/scary/comedy types of movies this is for you.

51,insomniac_rod,Cult classic with high cheese factor.,8,17 December 2006,"A cult classic by now and probably one of the most aired Horror movies ever! No joke, every week ""Tremors"" airs on regular t.v. worldwide. The cult status is somehow mysterious because it isn't a very well done Horror movie but it has a heart and it's somehow cheesy enough to keep your attention.The action scenes are memorable because the whole monster concept is cheesy but cool at the same time.""Tremors"" is one of those movies that you can't help but enjoy. I mean, there's a high cheese factor and some silliness but still it's a well done production for B-movie standards. Kevin Bacon delivers a solid and memorable performance as an unconventional action hero.Watch ""Tremors"" in order to witness one of the most watched Horror movies of the past decade.",Tremors
52,southdavid,Six Degrees of Excavation,8,24 May 2021,"With a new Tremors film released late in 2020, and now available on Sky, it seemed like a good idea to first go back and revisit the other six films in the series, before hitting that one. I have a suspicion that only this first film will be any good, but we'll go at it with an open mind.Two handymen, Valentine McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Bass (Fred Ward) are scrimping together a living doing odd jobs around the small town of Perfection, Nevada. When residents start turning up dead they learn they are under attack from an ancient predator, one that burrows underground and pops up to claim its prey. With the help of Rhonda LeBeck (Finn Carter) a student seismologist who is working in the area, the pair try to escape the valley with the surviving inhabitants.""Tremors"" is, despite its relatively low budget, hugely successful at what it attempts to do. The practical effects work really well - with puppets used for both the large worms, and the smaller ""Feelers"" that the graboids use to snare their prey. Whilst definitely otherworldly, the slime and movement give decent impressions of life and the fact that the puppet versions can be physically damaged also sells the illusion. The rest of the time, camera adjustments, bulges under the soil and smoke effects are used to give the impression of the creature's movement. There are some really solid other effects too, such as the shaking and collapse of buildings as the graboids destroy the foundations.As ever though, it's the characters that make a film like this work, and the combination of Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are an engaging pair. I liked many of the rest of the townsfolk too, even if some of them are essentially just fodder to demonstrate the existing threat. Even the survivalist couple, played by Michael Gross and Reba McEntire are fun to be around, which is useful, because I recall that I'm going to be spending a lot of time with Michael Gross over the run of these sequels.It's admittedly a B-Movie, and you have to be in the right mood. It also helps that this is a film I've grown up watching, so it does have some fuzzy nostalgia for me. We'll see whether that extends to the sequels in the coming weeks.",Tremors
53,GOWBTW,Enjoyed it very much!,9,3 June 2007,"A horror dealing with mutant subterranean worms? This movie is definitely an original. The cast of the movie are great: Kevin Bacon(aka ""Mr. Kyra Sedgwick"" movies like ""Footloose"", ""Murder in The First"", ""Friday the 13th"" and several others to name a few) Fred Ward, Michaal Gross of ""Family Ties"" fame, Reba McIntyre(Country sensation and actress) and many others as well. A small town which nothing big ever happens. Until now. This is where strangeness appears when you least expected. People are strangely dying off. A Ford LTD Station Wagon being dragged into the ground, livestock being mutilated, and worse, man with his rifle found dead on a wire tower. Now a murderer wouldn't scare a person like that. Only the killer is from the ground. They would later discover that the killer is a graboid, a sub-terrain worm that would cause earthquakes. So it took a lot of team effort to stop these creatures from wiping out the population The best way to outmaneuver these worms were ATVS or tank-line vehicles to get by. This movie is a real gem, and I wouldn't have anything bad to say about it either. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. 4 out of 5 stars!",Tremors
54,hellraiser7,Land Sharks,10,23 October 2012,"There is always something about Super Sized foes that have always fascinated me. It's hard to explain why may'be just the simple fact that their super sized which means they can do whatever they want. This film out of the sub genre of horror is my favorite super sized monster film as well as personal favorite horror films.The Graboid monsters are great the design in inventive and original, I love the concept behind them the fact that they come from the ground, their practically land sharks. When it comes to regular sharks you can get to shore quickly since they can only swim in the water but the Graboids operate on the land, and since we need Earth to walk on our chances of running and hiding are slim. The pupeteering and animatronics are excellent, even the orange slushy blood gore effects are and it's all practical. I even like the behavior of the monsters making them sort of like animals whom have their strengths and weaknesses, I also like the fact that despite primal their not stupid these worms have a learning curve, may'be not as fast as ours but good enough to know what to do and not to which gives them a slight edge.I like the fact that the Graboids origins are enigmatic which I feel makes them all the more interesting as opposed to the typical explanation which I feel sometimes makes the monster seem a little less interesting. Whether it was a government experiment forgotten about, an undiscovered species, or simply came from outer space I leave up to you. The action and suspense is really good, your constantly wanting the protagonists to get on stable high ground. But there are some good Graboid kills in the action sequences, my favorite sequence no doubt is the shootout in Burt's basement, it sort of reminds me of the end boss fights in video game Contra where you constantly shoot at it's vital points, it was just funny and cool seeing both Burt and Heather just shoot the crap out of the Graboid with everything in their arsenal and afterward Burt say my favorite quote in the film, I won't say it but trust me it's cool and comic gold.The dialog is just great, I really like the use of profanity it's used in a tasteful and colorful manner as well as frequently as much as you would see on the TV show ""South Park"". There are lots of great scenes with this, like one scene where Melvin decides to stupidly cry wolf one more time throws the basketball to Earl, and then Earl retorts harshly which I can't help but crack up toward, but it's funny because it's true there have been people that have pushed a wrong button with us.The characters are just great and are actually colorful and three dimensional and not slasher fodder. Val (played well by one of my favorite actors Kevin Bacon) and Burt (also played well by another favorite actor Fred Ward). I love the fact that the protagonist are blue collar ordinary adult you might see every day and not some cliché pretty boys and girls which I'm seriously getting sick of in the horror genre. Both have a great back and forth and are easy to emphasize with because both I wouldn't say are two that are men with ambition but more like in search of an ambition. Their bored with their jobs as well as their lives and both desire better and are looking and waiting for their time though killing Graboids and saving Perfection is more than they asked. However my favorite character is Burt Gummer. Michael Gross is excellent in the role it's probably my favorite role from him, Burt could be related to the character Walter from ""The Big Lebauski"" because like him he's practically gung ho, a soldier without a war to fight. Despite not a man of muscle he really is true to his role as a tough as nails survivalist.Overall, Tremors is a fun horror film that has a lot of rumble. So, watch your step it could be your last.Rating: 4 stars",Tremors
55,PWNYCNY,Everyone should know a Burt Gummer.,7,9 September 2005,"This movie shows that during times of great adversity, when your very survival is being threatened by forces or things beyond your control, it always helps to have a guy like Burt Gummer around.

I remember I used to watch this film all the time when I was young and it was the funniest horror movie I've ever seen.  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are excellent in their roles as two bickering, low-key handymen who must save the town they planned on leaving in the first place from giant man-eating worms.  The idea behind the graboids not being able to see, but can hear their prey is in a unique concept that's pulled off well and it gives way to some pretty good chase scenes through the desert.  Tremors was followed by Tremors 2: Aftershocks, a funnier, but less entertaining sequel.  Tremors gets a 10/10.",Tremors
57,atinder,Great movie,8,23 June 2009,"I can't believe I have not done a review on this movie already if this movie was never made I don't think I be the horror fan I am today! The Plot: Trying to break away from their dead-end life in the desert town of Perfection, Nevada, Valentine ""Val"" McKee and Earl Bassett find themselves sidetracked when corpses mysteriously start piling up around them. When Val and Earl have a run-in with several creepy tentacle creatures that have made lunch out of a road crew, they get back to the town to spread the news. Although these monsters are not exactly intellectuals, their mental powers are still mind-boggling. Detecting a human hiding in a car, they dig under the vehicle, causing it to sink into the earth. Val and Earl get help from several townspeople. With the help of Rhonda, Val and Earl kill one of the monsters. But there are three of them left, and they are each about 30 feet long. Walter starts calling the monsters Graboids. When the survivors think they have outwitted the Worms by staying on the roofs of their buildings, the Giant worms try to destroy the buildings' foundations, The worms are fast learners when it comes to stalking their prey, and the humans must continually be on their toes if they want to stay alive while they try to find a way to beat the Giant worms.As this was the first horror movie I saw when I was six or seven year old, what a great way to get in horror genre This movie was very funny and monster was kind of scary and the acting suited the movie just right!

58,mjneu59,a not-entirely-guilty pleasure,7,11 January 2011,"Nobody's ever going to confuse this subterranean 'Jaws' parody with 'Citizen Kane', but it's unlikely Orson Welles could have made a better action-comedy about giant mutant earthworms terrorizing desert Nevada. The film doesn't really belong to the horror genre; it's more of a buddy movie with monsters. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are the dumb but likable cowboy handyman team, and the marauding beasts (ugly 'Alien' inspired creatures nicknamed Graboids) are everything a movie monster should be: big, strong, bad-tempered and, worst of all, smart. Director Ron Underwood gets more mileage out of anticipation than surprise, but what the film lacks in shock value it makes up for with a quick pace, some clever mechanical effects, and an efficient screenplay that drags a handful of sympathetic characters from the frying pan to the fire and back again. On a cinematic Richter scale it might only measure a 4.6: hardly something to regard seriously, but strong enough to guarantee a good ride.",Tremors

I can respect that kind of dedication to identity, even if it is grade-school simple and lowbrow, and that's a big part of why the movie's still such a blast to watch today. Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and Reba McEntire head up a cast that's about as one-dimensional as it gets, flaunting their stereotypes with enthusiasm in the midst of an utterly ridiculous set of circumstances. The premise behind the monsters is original, and the effects actually look pretty solid considering their age, but the concept is pushed to such extremes that there's nothing to do but laugh at the sheer, ballsy idiocy of it all. It's stupid, thin and thoroughly overdone, but just as much dumb, naked fun to watch today as it was when I first caught it at the age of twelve. A gratifying way to senselessly waste ninety minutes of your life.",Tremors
60,barnabyrudge,Semi-comedy update of the '50s monster movie.,8,29 July 2004,"A delightful update of the '50s monster movie, Tremors is a knowing creature-feature which combines excitement and humour with enormous skill. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon play a major role in contributing to the film's success, with their neatly judged performances (tongues slightly in cheeks, without allowing things to slip into smug, irritating self parody). Somewhere in America's wide open spaces, a pair of likable, simple-minded handymen, Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward), begin to come across bloody remains strewn around in the scrubland. Soon, they learn that the remains belong (or, rather, belonged) to victims of giant, burrowing earthworms which drag their human prey into the ground and devour them in seconds. Val and Earl gather together the eclectic local population and try to figure out a way of escaping the deadly beasts (nicknamed ""Graboids"" by the townfolk), aided by female scientist Rhonda LeBeck (Finn Carter). Terrific humourous touches are provided by Michael Gross and Reba McEntire, as the town's married gun fanatics (with an underground arsenal beneath their house that would look fitting in a Death Wish movie!) Throughout the film, the dialogue is full of witty references and amusing banter (an earlier IMDB reviewer complained about bad language, but it's minimal in all honesty - certainly nothing worth mentioning). The special effects are pretty good, but are not overdone to the point where they overwhelm the story. In many modern films (e.g. anything by Stephen Sommers) the visual trickery is used to replace a good narrative, but in Tremors the special effects and the narrative work hand-in-hand to add to the entertainment. Monster movies may be trash at heart - always have been, always will be - but Tremors is a refreshingly intelligent, witty and enjoyable offering that is ten times better than most so-called ""serious"" films.",Tremors
61,kirbylee70-599-526179,EARTH SHAKING CRITTERS,9,28 June 2021,"Horror movies have gone through numerous phases but one of the most amusing was the radiation scares of the 50s. Back then the fear of nuclear war propelled film makers to have all sorts of bugs and animals affected by radioactive isotopes wreaking havoc on the world. Giant ants in THEM, more insects like TARANTULA and THE DEADLY MANTIS and who can forget THE GIANT GILA MONSTER. Most of these films played at drive-ins for teens but they bring back fond memories now.So who would think that 31 years ago a movie would be made twisting that concept a bit and offering a mutated deadly animal that plowed underground attacking a small town out west? And yet it happened. The movie was TREMORS and it's coming out in blu-ray and HD format from the folks at Arrow Video.If you haven't seen the film the small town of Perfection, Nevada (population 14) is home to Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward), two friends who've made a life here performing all the odd jobs they can find. New to the area is Rhonda (Finn Carter) a college student there to monitor seismographs in the area set up by the university. She discovers a lot of seismic activity in the area with no cause. She also catches the eye of Val even though he has his dream girl in mind, something Earl chides him about constantly.Val and Earl finally decided to pick up and move when they find the body of an older resident dead atop a power tower. An autopsy reveals he died there of dehydration, something they all find strange. They head out once more and discover another local resident, or at least his head, and his flock of sheep half eaten. After this they're determined to leave and but at the edge of town the road is blocked and they workers who were there are missing. Almost stuck here they get away and drive back to town.It is in town that they discover the limb of whatever this creature is attached to their truck's axle. That was what was holding them up. It isn't long before they discover the rest of this creature, a massive underground dweller that tunnels through dirt faster than a human can run. And it's hungry. As a matter of fact all of them are when they discover there is more than one.The story takes a turn here as these worms that they dub ""graboids"" begin tracking down the residents with the hope of a tasty meal. Now it's a matter of survival among those left. Fortunately among them are Burt and Heather (Michael Gross and Reba McEntire), a survivalist couple with plenty of firepower on hand. But will that be enough to save the day?The movie was always fun to watch and made a distinct impression on fans who fell in love with it. Unfortunately that wasn't enough fans to make this a hugely successful film when it was first released. The movie did make back its expenses but it wasn't the smash you might remember it as. But fans were loyal and a second film was made with Ward and Gross returning to reprise their roles. As a matter of fact more TREMORS films ended up being made. Seven at last count with the last one, TREMORS: SHRIEKER ISLAND just coming out in 2020 and the possibility of an eighth lingering. There was also a season long series on the Sy Fy Channel.But all of this began with the mid to low budget original film. And what a movie that was. It is the perfect combination of humor and horror with a touch of science fiction tossed into the mix. The movie rolls at a smooth pace without a wasted moment on film. No elaborate car chases or over the top effects, everything fits perfectly into place here like a jigsaw puzzle made of all white pieces. It wasn't easy to make but the end result is satisfying on all levels.The acting here is top of the line and the company making the film were in luck to get the great cast that they did. All of them bring their characters to life in the best way possible. Most surprising was Gross who many remember as the level headed father on the TV series FAMILY TIES who is completely different here. The cinematography is superb especially considering the issues they had to work with since it almost all takes place outside. The script is tight and the direction, a first film for director Ron Underwood, is dynamite.Arrow has this one chock full of extras as well from archive interviews to current ones. The package also features a booklet on the film and the movie in a 4k restoration that makes it look spectacular. They've outdone themselves on this release and make it worth every penny. So if you're a fan of the film or just looking for a fun night at the movies then by all means, this one is worth picking up.",Tremors
62,dwpollar,Fun but goofy movie...,6,3 January 2009,"1st watched 1/1/2009 -(Dir-Ron Underwood): Fun but goofy movie about a couple of good-old boys in a small town who come across an underground creature that's swallowing everything up. They act like they want to leave town permanently, but their connections to the townsfolk keep them there when they keep running across members of the town dying for unknown reasons. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are believable enough in the leads and the creature is unique enough to keep your interest. This movie definitely is not perfect and has a good set of cornball and redneck humor that isn't that funny, but what makes the movie interesting is the creature. It detects it's prey based on rumblings in the ground(aka. tremors) or general noise, it appears to get smarter the longer it chases it's prey, and it looks like a huge slug but has multiple tentacles coming out of it's mouth. The funniest character, a Japanese store owner who insists on making profit on everything and insists on naming the creature, dies early in the story unfortunately. But unlike other horror movies, most of the characters survive to work together to get rid of this thing. There is some back-biting but mostly their goal is for everyone (or as many as possible) to survive. The group is trapped in a valley surrounded by mountains so they mainly have each other with no means of communication with others outside the valley. Nothing really Oscar-worthy here but the movie has scares, and is pretty much a fun movie from beginning to end. A nice find amidst a lot of schlock in this genre these days.",Tremors

65,slokes,Death From Below,8,6 June 2006,"""Tremors"" is a rarity: A genuinely suspenseful and gory thriller that manages to be whimsical. It may not be the funniest thriller I've seen (""Evil Dead 2"" has it beat for pure laughs AND shock value), but it's a marvelously clever and engaging film well worth your time.Think ""Jaws"" only with dirt. In an isolated Nevada valley, the residents of a tiny roadstop called Perfection discover they are no longer alone. Four giant worms, apparently separated from the set of ""Dune,"" have taken up residence in the ground beneath them and acquired an appetite for human flesh. Standing on their rooftops, their cars and horses gone, the people of Perfection are picked off one by one, as odd-job men Val and Earl find themselves with their oddest job yet.A lot of things are right with ""Tremors,"" starting with the chemistry of the two leads. Kevin Bacon as Val radiates smug cockiness while Fred Ward as his older partner Earl worries about the future. Early on, we see the pair after working in a junkyard, drinking beers kept cold in a discarded toilet bowl. Disagreements are settled with contests of rock-paper-scissors.Bacon may have been slumming in a film like this, but he delivers the best performance I've seen from him, enjoyably low-key and funny. Ward is even better in his grizzled grouchy way, fuming whenever his buddy rides him, which is often.The rest of the small cast (only 17 people appear in the film, and most of them are appetizers) consists largely of no-names, but they are terrific, too. Michael Gross sheds the mellow dad persona TV viewers of the period knew from ""Family Ties"" as hawkish survivalist Burt Gummer who along with his wife Heather (country star Reba McEntire) finally discovers a use for that well-stocked weapons arsenal in his basement. Gross and McEntire are another great pair, too, and co-star with a giant worm in the film's most thrilling and mind-blowing scene, one of the zaniest thriller sequences ever shot.There's also an annoying kid named Melvin who gets on everyone else's nerves by pretending to be attacked by the worms for a cheap laugh, then cackling about it. Of course, the one time no one takes Melvin seriously is when he's really in trouble.Utterly formulaic, ""Tremors"" makes a great case for formula. Its 90 minutes are neatly divided into a half-hour for establishing the characters and setting (director Ron Underwood nicely sets up the desolate boredom of his scrubby desert terrain), a half-hour for presenting the menace of the monsters, and a half-hour for the thrill-packed resolution, which involves elephant guns, homemade bombs, and a bulldozer.Throughout, the film keeps you laughing, with Earl and Val's one-liners (""Who died and made you Einstein?""), the Gummers' exaggerated bunker mentality, how various wormy ""graboids"" are dispatched, and a sly sense of what is expected from a film like this. No real coherent explanation is offered for the graboids' existence, while the dumbness of Val and Earl is a smokescreen for the clever ways the film sets you up to expect one thing before delivering another. Whenever one of them yells ""I've got a plan,"" which is about every other minute, it's a sure thing something is about to go very wrong.""Tremors"" may lack Speilbergian polish, but its got a lot of energy and wit for a film of its kind. It doesn't wallow in gore, but it keeps you nervous enough the first time you watch it. The great thing about ""Tremors"" is how much you find yourself laughing at the same time.",Tremors
66,ferbs54,Don't Mess With Reba's Rec Room,8,23 January 2006,"Several months ago, I watched a film called ""The Worm Eaters"" ('77), a truly horrendous movie about big grown-ups who like to eat little worms. Just last night, I went 180 degrees and saw ""Tremors"" ('90) for the first time, an excellent film in which giant, 30-foot-long worms take to eating people in the desert town of Perfection, NV (population:14). So now I know what the rest of the world has been aware of for the past 16 years: This is a terrifically entertaining, fast-paced, action-packed sci-fi/comedy hybrid, with one outstanding set piece after another, likable and offbeat characters (Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward's Val & Earl make for one fun team), very fine FX and way-cool monsters. Fans of 1950s science fiction (my personal favorite film genre) will just eat this movie up, especially since--unlike such classic fare as, oh, ""The Giant Behemoth"" ('59)--we get to see the scary critters fairly early on in this picture. And these intelligent, giant sand monsters really are something to see, what with their snakelike tentacle tongues, relentlessness and great speed; much scarier than the sand creatures that threatened Adam West in a classic ""Outer Limits"" episode called ""The Invisible Enemy."" Fans of Reba McEntire should love seeing her strap on some serious firepower and have at these nasty ""graboids,"" too. Executiver producer Gale Anne Hurd's previous films ""The Terminator"" ('84) and ""Aliens"" ('86) have this in common with ""Tremors"": Once they get going, there's just no letup.

This feels like a B horror film from bygone years but has plenty of humor in it too and doesn't take itself seriously. Which leads a good insight into the movies idea and special effects shots. Set in the fictional town of Perfection, Nevada, the film follows a day in the life of two handy men (Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon) riding out an existence in the bad lands of America, until they decide they have had enough and head for the nearest city, only to find that something horrible is eating its way through every one they've known, and is eyeing up the residence of Perfection valley for afters, their only hope is to make a stand with the help of Burt Gummer, a gun crazed militaristic fanatic and the owner of the local shop, played by John Carpenter staple Victor Wong.The perfectly cast Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward lead the cast as the handy-men Val and Earl, who become entangled in the feeding antics of the giant 'graboids', the film goes on from there. The film's special effects are appropriately down-to-earth and managing to work around the film's relatively low budget and use the creature's subterranean nature to the film's advantage. Despite this subdued approach to effects, the film never feels like anything but a Hollywood blockbuster. Blissfully large in scale and featuring monsters with a real bite, the films effects fire on all cylinders. The film as a whole is like that: a little action, a little gore, and then a joke to ease the tension. It's fast, funny, dry, humorous and has a cracking cast. Its a film you will never be bored with.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Tremors
70,slayrrr666,"Start of a good franchise, and it's worth it",8,25 June 2004,"`Tremors' is one of those films that you love to watch over and over again, that never gets old.**SPOILERS**Hired to check the nearby spooked cattle, long-time friends Valentine, (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward) find it to be an unknown source. Going back to town, no one seems to know either what is going on. Several more disappearances occur during the next few days, inciting the curiosity of a geologist, Rhonda, (Finn Carter) who happen to run into Val and Earl. They return back to town, but discover that a giant snake had unknowingly wrapped around their truck.  Selling it to a local friend of theirs, Walter (Victor Wong) who immediately buys it from Val and Earl and turns it into a freak-show at his gas station. After a few days with more disappearances, everyone comes to realize that they have to get away before whatever happened to the disappeared people will happen to them. Making a run for it, Val and Earl discover the source to be giant worms about 20 feet long. The `snakes' discovered earlier are the creatures' tongues. With Rhonda in tow, they return to the town with the knowledge of what happened and finally convince the town's people to leave. However, the worms have followed Val and Earl back to town and they begin to attack the town, leaving everyone wondering if they're next to be sucked under. Remembering what happened when they met the earlier worm, Val leads the last worm away from the town and kills it, saving the town.The Good News: This is finally a PG-13 horror movie that works, mainly because the two leads Bacon and Ward have a dynamic presence together on screen. They seem to have a knack for playing the kind of characters in this film, being care-free but still being recognizable for the audience. With the PG-13 rating, we get a surprising amount of gore in this film. I'm not talking about `Friday the 13th' gore, but we get several nice scenes of bloodletting. The final worm kill is especially commendable for this, as it is particularly nasty. While still being PG-13, they're aren't a lot of big scares in the film, but it doesn't seem too distracting. Because Bacon and Ward do have plenty of humorous whips at each other, high-impact scares would just seem out-of-place. The desert town is perfectly captured, as it doesn't look that small nor that big, like a real desert town should be. The location shooting helps out by having the cast running long distance runs in one shot, not exactly an idea copied in today's horror movies. The mystery in the film in the beginning is really well handled. The curiosity of what the worms look like is brilliantly handled, revealing just the tongues first, then the body shape, then the creature itself in it's entirety. It looks like a PG-13 monster too, being simply scary enough for a younger crowd while being too simplistic for a more discerning audience. For the type of movie, it works simply perfect.The Bad News: Simply off the top of my head, I'm pretty sure that I can't remember anything too bad about it. It does have a heavy campy-ness to it, but the film knows it and plays with it, having scenes that obviously show off this tag. The worm's death at the end, the naming of the worms, and how they decide to give them their name are all classic examples of campy scenes in this movie. I'll remember more later, and maybe I'll post them on one of the boards.The Final Verdict: There are tons of worse films you can watch to lose an hour and a half of your time. This is a film recommended to those who can watch a complete film that makes no sense without questioning logic, or to those who want to watch a good film who need a good entry to start them on down the road to watching these kinds of movies.Rated PG-13: Language, some Violence",Tremors
71,MartianOctocretr5,Brainless amusing fun,8,22 February 2007,"This is one of those tongue-in-cheek horror/comedy movies that pokes fun at itself as it goes along. The humor is clever, and the action is handled surprisingly well. There's never a dull moment, the plot drives forward quite efficiently, with lulls in just the right measure to advance scientific monster theories and comic-relief banter.The characters are well defined and likable. Some are resourceful, some are goofy, some are vulnerable; there's a couple who own enough ammunition to blow up a city, there are even annoying twerps in the mix. It's a good cross-section of personality types for this type of them-or-us creature effects movie, although just how all these people happened to be in a one-horse town out in the middle of the desert nowhere is never explained.This one boasts a hilarious ensemble cast that just clicks together magnificently. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are obviously having a blast as dopey hicks, Reba McEntire and Michael Gross had fun as the trigger-happy militia couple, and you'll catch sight of a pre-Jurassic Park Ariana Richards too. Three years before she got chased by Raptors, she was menaced by Graboids. These fiendish subterranean monsters burrow around at a 100 mph, and they're deceptively smart too, figuring out clever ways to zap humans to munch on.Goofy brainless nonsense. No cranial activity is required to view this movie, just a silly mood.",Tremors
72,sme_no_densetsu,An entertaining throwback to 1950's monster movies,8,8 May 2018,"Believe it or not, there have been six ""Tremors"" movies to date, with the latest one being released just this year. There was also a short-lived TV series and a recent reboot (starring Kevin Bacon) that unfortunately seems to have stalled at the pilot stage. Not too bad for what was essentially the modern equivalent of a B movie. While the ongoing series may be a case of diminishing returns, the original movie is still entertaining after almost thirty years.The story takes place in the sleepy town of Perfection, Nevada. A couple of handymen, Val (Kevin Bacon) & Earl (Fred Ward), decide that they've finally had enough of their dead-end jobs and decide to skip town. However, their attempts to leave are sidetracked by strange occurrences that appear to be linked to some sort of underground creatures. Before long, they figure out exactly what they're up against and the tiny population of Perfection is forced to fight for their survival.The premise may be a fairly simple one but the core idea is pretty neat. Having creatures lurking underground provides a great foundation for suspense. In fact, the movie plays almost like ""Jaws"" on land. There's a bit of scientific background given for the creatures but their origin is wisely left up to the viewer. More than anything, I'd say that the movie is nicely reminiscent of 1950's monster movies like ""Them!""From a visual standpoint, the movie is surprisingly well done. In a movie like this, the special effects can make or break the entire movie. I'm glad to say that the practical effects are expertly handled and still look good even today. While not everything is completely convincing, there's some very impressive work here for a modestly budgeted horror movie.The cast is also one of the movie's strengths. Kevin Bacon & Fred Ward made a good team and ""Family Ties"" star Michael Gross nearly stole the show as survivalist Burt Gummer. The movie also marked the film debut of Reba McEntire and she fit in well alongside Michael Gross. Lead actress Finn Carter may not be known for much else but she didn't seem out of place here by any means.Ultimately, ""Tremors"" proves itself to be an affectionate homage to monster movies of a bygone era. It's got lots of suspense but also a healthy dose of humour. Add in nifty special effects and an engaging cast and you've got an entertaining popcorn movie that's likely to appeal to more than just horror fans.",Tremors
73,oneguyrambling,The best giant underground killer worm movie in history!,10,27 December 2011,"The sleepy town of Perfection is suddenly and unexpectedly (duh) beset by large underground creatures who sense movement above and devour pretty much anything. With no chance of contact with the outside world the surviving inhabitants of the town try to stay alive long enough to devise a plan of escape from the subterranean menace.On the surface that might be a similar description to dozens of other creature or monster flicks. But let's take a closer look using my just invented 10 category technique.Plot – Credit must be given for providing enough credibility that we get involved in these ludicrous actions, that's part acting but having a believable plot helps mightily.Everything in the film, every decision, action and consequence is thought through thoroughly and given due explanation and justification.1 point.Dialogue – Insanely quotable and hardly a phrase or line is wasted. From Walter Chang offering ""Swiss cheese and some bullets"" to Burt Gummer's reasons behind moving to Perfection ""That's why we moved here in the first place. Geographic isolation"".Central characters Val an Earl also enjoy an effortless back and forth banter throughout the film, almost every aside, quip and remark provides amusement.1 point.Cast – Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward) are note perfect as the good natured local dogsbodies, their characters never get too clever or perform superhuman feats and they react as you probably would when faced with killing machines from beneath your feet.The minor bit parts aren't called upon to do much but look like they're frightened and/or dinner, but unlike many B movies no-one is obviously the guy replacing the real actor who called in sick.1 point.Creatures – Another massive + 1. I'm not sure what the budget for the Graboids was but they come up a treat. As with everything else every detail is thought through, so these giant monsters can be explained logically (enough) to be believable.The centrepiece of the film must be the first dead Graboid that dies chasing Val and Earl by running into a drainage wall. The dead creature is initially seen in lovingly disgusting close up as it oozes fluid, and when Val delightedly exclaims ""I've found the ass-end"" we finally see the full scope of what they are facing.1 point.Plausibility – Once we agree that for the next 90 minutes giant underground worms exist everything else that ensues is perfectly reasonable.I also love the conversations among the Perfection-ists as to the origins of the Graboids, and the fact that the film didn't even try to give a final reason or explanation of how they came to be.They just are (were?), and the locals had to deal with them. Everything that followed made perfect sense to me.1 point.Music – Hugely underrated. The music in Tremors is pitch perfect and oddly catchy – I'm humming it right now in my head – the country flavoured instrumentals are neither overbearing or hooky, they just provide a little background atmosphere when required.Even the obligatory ""we've got a country singer in the cast let her bust out a tune over the credits"" isn't too bad and I don't like country music.1 point.Camera-work – Again doesn't get its due. There are some effective wide shots of the town that manage to show all the residents at once while stranded on their rooftops, some nifty zooms and close ups at relevant points and some nice scenic vistas of the incredible mountain features near Perfection, especially in the closing half hour of the film as the survivors move along with the bulldozer.1 point.Effects – Tremors was made before CGI was widespread, so the filmmakers wisely came up with various low key yet effective methods to highlight the menace, size and speed of the Graboids without having to show them too frequently. Remember they live under the ground, so most of the time this wasn't too hard to justify not seeing them.But in the brief scenes where they are spotted cruising near the rocks while Val, Earl and Rhonda are stranded on top, and the initial arrival in Perfection the Graboids are immaculate and never less than believable.The effects guys sensibly mix up the techniques frequently so nothing becomes stale or obvious, at times there are shots from Graboid-eye view, and the occasional money shots when they leap out of the ground to attack and devour victims look effective. 1 point.Tone – Tremors never tries to get ahead of itself, there are no obvious jokes, the dialogue remains low key, no character suddenly transforms into something that they weren't and in a film about giant worms there are no over the top kills purely there to be clever or memorable.Somehow by not aiming high or gunning for a home run the film manages to do both.1 point.Enjoyment – Are you kidding me? I watch this 20 year old B movie EVERY YEAR because I love it. I smile for practically the entire 95 minutes in every viewing. I annoy the hell out of my wife by quoting ridiculously obscure passages and phrases for no reason (""Damn right fifteen"") That's exactly what makes it the best B Movie ever made, cinematic perfection set in Perfection.1 point.Final Rating – 10 / 10. Only the second Perfect 10 in 3 years of this site. I didn't want to give another 10 but there really was no other option here.",Tremors
74,IonicBreezeMachine,An endearingly cheesy monster classic that balances the fun and thrills of the genre,9,8 April 2021,"Set in the isolated desert town of Perfection, Nevada, we follow Val and Earl (Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward) two handy men doing the dirty and rough work of the town's citizens while dreaming of bigger and better things. When the two finally get fed up and set off for Bixby, the two find themselves halted on more the one occasion playing good Samaritan addressing strange occurrences on their journey out of perfection. When the two wind up trapped in the town after an avalanche blocks the road they attempt to get out on foot only to discover that giant worms are responsible for the occurrences and have been working their way towards the town of perfection for the main course. Now Val and Earl alongside University Seismologist Rhonda LeBeck (Finn Carter) must try to stop the worms and save Perfection.Beginning development by writers Brent Maddock and S. S. Wilson in the 80s, the film was inspired by the duo's work under the U. S. Navy creating instructional videos when they were filming personnel on top of a rock and wondering ""what if something kept them on the rock"". This became the basis for Land Sharks, when the duo struck a sleeper hit with the Steve Guttenberg vehicle Short Circuit, the duo got the traction they needed in 1988 and commenced work on Land Sharks (Now titled Beneath Perfection and soon Tremors). While the film was initially not released with much faith with Kevin Bacon even lamenting in private he was in a Giant Worm movie, the movie was released in January and surprising for a movie in that time frame got good reviews. Tremors is an endearing horror comedy classic that despite lukewarm box office became a staple of many peoples' childhoods thanks to its massive success on Home Video.While the selling point of giant man eating worms is certainly a selling point for campy monster movie fun, Wilson and Braddock don't rest their laurels on that premise and populate the film with strong characters and make the town of Perfection itself a character. Both Ward and Bacon have great chemistry together and play off each other really well with their frequent games of Rock, Paper, Scissors to settle arguments or their causal jibes at each other's expense that gives them a sense of history, but the movie gives us character to spare with a town filled with eccentric and likable weirdos. Finn Carter is a lot of fun playing the Seismologist who becomes the de facto science expert on the worms despite her specializing in seismology and not Zoology and this leads to some funny exchanges where the townspeople look to her for answers that she just doesn't have (much to her exasperation). Character actor Victor Wong also shows up playing General Store owning, Chang, and has so fun with his character trying to figure out ways to use the worms as an excuse to build a tourist trap. But easily the best characters in the movie are Burt and Heather Gummer (Michael Gross and Reba McEntire respectively), a husband and wife team of off the grid survivalist who live just outside of perfection waiting for that ""imminent collapse"" when only the ""prepared"" will survive. Not only are they absolutely hilariously with their paranoid delusions, but their survivalists leads to easily the most exciting and possibly funniest part of the film when a worm charges their home and immediately regrets that decision. It's no surprise why these characters became so endearing to the franchise legacy and served as a possible inspiration for Dale Gribble on King of the Hill.And what would a giant worm movie be without the worms themselves? The movie features four worms, nicknamed ""grabboids"" for their tendency to grab things with their multiple snake like tongues (in that their tongues LOOK like snakes) and the designs are just perfect. From the build up where we only see a little of them, to our first full body reveal there's not only a lot of work clearly put into the construction of the grabboids, but also into how they work. Little details such as a multitude of flippers that serve as propulsion and piercing beaks make the creatures a force to be reckoned with and the creatures are creatively used throughout the movie. Not only do they eat without remorse or satiety, but they also learn whenever one of their fellow grabboids are killed and alter their attack strategy making them smarter than your usual movie monster.Tremors is just fun. It's a fun concept, with fun characters, and a fun sense of thrills and adventure. From it's buddy dynamic with Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon to its town denizens populated by recognizable character actors with personality to spare, it's a movie that is certainly silly but puts effort and craft behind the silliness. While it's a shame the movie didn't do better in theaters, I'm glad it found an audience on home video and continues to be introduced by families to their children.",Tremors
75,blott2319-1,A crazy enjoyable creature feature,9,7 April 2020,"Tremors is a crazy monster movie that is better than it has any right to be. The premise is extremely simple, but when it's executed this well, I don't mind. The first thing that makes this movie work so well is the limited cast. Because the events take place in such a tiny town removed far from civilization, we are able to meet all the important characters in a brief amount of time. The key to any film like this is that we know the people being terrorized so we will worry about them all surviving. While Kevin Bacon certainly takes the main hero role, this is an ensemble film, and it intensifies the danger when our protagonists are spread out in many different places. I think the other aspect that made Tremors so enjoyable for me is that it didn't feel like it was taking itself too seriously. That's not to say that this is a farce, because they treat it all seriously, but there is a tongue-in-cheek approach to certain aspects of this film that feels self-aware. It seems clear the writers and director understood that this is a fun story that can get over-the-top at times, so there's no need to act like they're making Citizen Kane.The creature effects in Tremors look great. They have a repulsive appearance, and I could easily understand how these creatures would work if they were real. It's clear the effects designers thought through how to make them both frightening and functional. My favorite characters in the film were played by Michael Gross and Reba McEntire because these gun-nuts are so ridiculous you just have to laugh. I also appreciated that they didn't go down the cliched route of having their obsession with firearms being their downfall. Instead the film acknowledges that, under the right circumstances, having that kind of firepower can be a life-saver. The other thing that made Tremors so enjoyable for me is that the characters behave logically. Often in films of this type it is reliant on people acting like idiots in order to increase the body count and the danger. Instead, if it means it will save their lives, these people are content to camp out on their rooftops all day. However, they still manage to ratchet up the tension by making the graboids moderately intelligent. All around, Tremors was a blast to watch, and I'm kind of sad it took me this long to discover it.",Tremors
76,vip_ebriega,"A fun, creepy and exciting creature feature. So much better than it is given credit for.",8,10 February 2007,"My Take: Alongside GREMLINS, it's one of the wildest monster movie send-offs there is. I really enjoyed watching this terrific tribute to old-fashioned B-monster flicks from the 50's. ""Tremors"" has a good monster movie story, a witty and intelligent script, outrageous creature effects and a fine cast. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are exceptionally hilarious as two handymen Val McKee and Earl Bassett, who must lead the townies of Perfection, Nevada to escape from the hungry pack of underground monsters. Sounds really B-styled huh? Well, it's really supposed to sound like that and the plot really works. It's really a fun movie, fun for most age groups (although it's rated PG-13 due to gruesome monster violence). It's kinda like ""Gremlins"", a B-movie styled horror film with a lot of wit and fast comedy. So what are you waiting for, rent or buy it now. It's uproarious horror movie to keep you glued to your seats for its hour-running time.Rating: **** out of 5.",Tremors
77,SanteeFats,Love it,9,5 July 2013,"What a fantastic movie!! It is so funny, well acted, well written, and sooooo outre. I love this movie and its sequel. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are great as the barely making it handymen in a very small town in the high desert. Reba McIntyre makes her film debut in this film and does a good job. I find it a little hypocritical that Michael Gross plays Reba's gun nut husband since he has been anti-gun in his statements and views. The entire concept of this movie is really good, from the hot grad student, Finn Carter (especially when she takes her pants off) doing seismic studies, to the dumb ass kid who doesn't believe until almost eaten,to the old owner of the only store who has a very old and bad ice cream freezer that entices the worms. It is just very funny to me.",Tremors
78,KnightsofNi11,The greatest giant worm movie ever!,7,30 May 2011,"Back in the day I remember watching Tremors all the time. I adored this movie as a kid. What more could a ten year old boy want than giant man-eating worms that explode into orange goopy blood? Now usually when I revisit a film from my childhood I am just blown away by how bad it is and I can't ask myself enough, ""Why did I think that was a good movie?"" But amazingly enough it is different with Tremors. So many years later I still really enjoyed this movie. It has a certain light hearted screwball sci-fi action nuance to it that is undeniably enjoyable. The film is about the residents of the town of Perfection, Nevada who are being terrorized by giant worms that devour people. The worms can only detect people by vibrations in the ground, forcing the survivors to outsmart these creatures, doing whatever they can to survive. The film perfectly blends elements of sci-fi, horror, and even loads of comedy into one immensely enjoyable film.As with any good horror movie, the creatures in this film are only slowly revealed. We know what is mysteriously killing off people at the beginning of the movie, but the characters themselves don't, only building our anticipation to the reveal of the monstrosities. And so after about thirty minutes of build up we are privileged to receive the reveal, and it is awesomely satisfying to see these menacing looking creatures in the flesh. The design of the creatures is excellent. These worms are almost like a more visceral and grotesque rendering of the sand worms from Dune. Thus, they are all the more threatening. It is truly awesome, and very exciting indeed.The nice thing about this film is just how much it satisfies our lust for giant worm movies, assuming that is a lust some people have. But really, this movie utilizes the underground worm design excellently, basing all of the action of the last half of the film on trying to outsmart these worms. This sets up for a plethora of suspenseful situations as the characters play mind games with the worms involving rocks, tractors, and pipe bombs. All the while the worms try to tear apart the town from under these characters, making for some very cool building collapses. However, there is something a little too jolly and light hearted about the film that makes the suspenseful scenes less suspenseful, but still plenty of fun.Tremors also features a great duo of protagonists, Val and Earl, played by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward respectively. This pair of redneck goof balls provide some of the films most amusing moments that don't concern giant worms. These two have a solid relationship that we can buy into so that we actually care what happens to them. The rest of the characters, unfortunately, aren't quite as memorable, but they also aren't as developed and fleshed out as Val and Earl. It's nice when you can see how much fun a couple of actors are having while working on a film and I see that so clearly through Bacon and Ward. It's just a shame that Bacon didn't stick around for the sequels. Maybe then they would have been worthwhile. Eh... probably not.Tremors has its fair share of plot holes and useless characters, but lets face it, we came here to see giant worms right? And that is just what we get. Plenty of giant worms eating people and blowing up in our faces, much to all of our delight. This movie has a premise that sets it up so well for disaster, but Tremors happily surprises us with its wit, class, and all around fun filled attitude. It is loads of fun for all that it is worth and come on, it's only ninety minutes so why wouldn't you just sit back and have a good time with this film?",Tremors

Tremors is an awesome show from start to finish. Kevin Bacon is outstanding and Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward share such great chemistry they really make the film Tremors so good. Finn Carter is perfect for the part and fits perfect in with Bacon and Ward. What a boyhood crush I had on Finn Carter in Tremors. It must have been the no pants scene. Michael Gross and Reba McEntire are seriously essential characters as they provide all the fight back needed that the tremors can handle. Kill those damn tremors good! Tremors is a must watch. It's a sure classic and not too majorly popular. Kids today, watch Tremors. It's the best ever. It has great, complex action sequences that are really quite intense.

I absolutely love the story, I love the characters, I love the acting, and most importantly, I love the animals themselves. Apparently this movie is called a horror movie, but I really have a hard time calling it a horror movie.  I associate horror with a cheesy story, bad acting, dumb comedy, and pointless plot points.  This movie has none of those.  I would definitely be more inclined to call this a sci-fi movie.The story is basically about these worm-like animals that have been dormant for quite some time, but start running amok again.  Anyhow, the story is very interesting and very intelligent.  The story works perfectly and is directed beautifully.  The movie definitely has it's share of comedy, but it's really good comedy.Like I mentioned before, the acting is great.  I loved all the actors, Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross, Reba McEntire, Ariana Richards, Bobby Jacoby, and all the others.  They all did a great job, and really pulled of their parts well.The special effects are incredible in the film.  It's really impressive to see a movie done so well without any computer effects.

86,Beejerman,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),10,22 February 2020,"The stage curtains open ...Every once in a while, a movie will come along that strikes the perfect balance between action, comedy, and horror. ""Tremors"" is one such movie. It became an immediate classic. Rarely have I enjoyed a movie so much during the initial viewing. I watched it again several times since and have enjoyed it just as much each time. It is easily one of my all time favorite movies ever made.In the small town of Perfection, nothing ever happens. It's one of those sleepy towns when driving through, if you blink, you miss it. Everybody knows everybody else. They are really like family. But when two handymen, and friends, Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward) decide to leave Perfection for good, they come across a dead body. It isn't long before they find that there are creatures that live underground ... creatures that they have labeled as ""Graboids"" that key in on their victim's location by the sound they make. Suddenly, Perfection is not just a no-where place - it's a death trap.This movie works on every level. The characters are strong with warm, yet eccentric personalities. The chemistry between Val and Earl is perfect. You are immediately drawn in by them. There are plenty of humorous situations that turn into ""watch out"" moments, and vice versa. Every dynamic works here. Reba McEntire and Michael Gross as the gun toting Gummers were also excellent in their roles.I highly recommend ""Tremors"".

It all changes after an incident when the two of them notice that many of the townspeople are missing and killed off by possibly a killer on the loose.

Hunting by vibrations and grabbing you under before you have time to run, Val, Earl and the remaining residents of the town must work together to stop the unstoppable worms.A cult favourite, which allows both Bacon and Ward to have fun with the story.

They decide to move away, but on the way out of town they discover that something is wrong. There is something in their town killing the locals. They have to try and find out when it is and stop it before everyone in the town dies.This film is a comedy in a lot of ways. It is a subtle comedy, but still very funny. The story is good and in a way this film started a lot of the films we are seeing these days.The effects are not actually that bad for its time. The film was made in 1990. Don't get me wrong, they are not great. You see a few strings etc but it just adds to the fun of the film.The acting is very very questionable. I don't think anyone in this film deserves an Oscar. The acting was very comical which helped the comedy aspect of the film. It was a funny movie. The movie stars Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross and Reba McEntire. Kevin is great in a lot of movies, and it did make a change to see him as a good guy his acting was hilarious in this.I have never seen any of the Tremors sequels and in a way I don't want to ruin the fun of this film. I get the feeling that the sequels will not be anywhere near as good as this but I will try them one day.I think this is a perfect film if you don't want to think about anything and just enjoy an action packed, fun film.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""We plan ahead, that way, we don't do anything right now.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Tremors

99,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,6 December 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!One of the funniest movies of the nineties, based on the horror and monster movies of the fifties, sees a small desert town coming under attack by giant man-eating underground worms. Unsurprisingly for such a concept, the film didn't do too well in cinemas but has since become a cult favourite.Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward star as handymen trapped in the stranded town- when they try to get back to civilization they encounter several corpses, a blocked road, and a woman investigating seismic shifts in the area. What they discover is that there are massive worms under the desert which are causing the mini quakes and murders, and heading towards the small town. They realize that the beasts sense movement, such as footsteps, and attack the source of the noise, and the townsfolk try to find a way out before being eaten. Radios do not work, and the only road to safety is blocked, and no outsiders are scheduled to be arriving any time soon. They face starvation, as do the worms, and can either fight, or wait.The best lines come between Ward and Bacon, with Carter providing further laughs, and even though a number of characters are killed, the tone remains light and comic. There is enough variety in the characters to stop the film from becoming predictable or repetitive, from two hyper gun-hunter types, to Melvin, to the various family members. The script is full of jokes and references to past monster movies, and the shocks and laughs are very frequent. All in all, an exciting film that most should enjoy, and a cult classic.8 out of 10",Tremors
100,mOVIemAN56,Not Great But Good and Scary,7,28 April 2005,"Temors wasn't really the best horror/thriller I've ever seen but it was interesting and very good. A small town called Perfection is a quiet and nice town in the desert. With a population of just under twenty people it's where one would go to be really secluded. But Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward) are eager to the leave the town for Bixby. Just before they leave a strange murder occurs, then another, then another. Val and Earl are worried and soon find out what is killing their fellow citizens. A giant worm animal is found in the desert dead, having crashed into a concrete wall. With the help of a scientist named Rhonda (Finn Carter) and local gun enthusiasts Burt and Heather Grummer (Micahel Cross and Reba McEntire) they must find a way to stop the 'underground monsters'.Tremors has some humor, some good acting from Bacon and Ward, and some pretty cool underground shots of the worm-like creatures slithering through. There are some pretty suspenseful scenes whether trying not to be sucked underground by the creatures or fishing with pipe bombs. The accents get old and fake after a while and the story runs slim at a few areas but it holds its own.Tremors.

102,jayjaycee,"The redneck version of ""Jaws""",7,30 July 2020,"""Tremors"" is a 1990 comedy horror film directed by Ron Underwood starring Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward.
⚪
All in all, this comedic creature feature delivers superb subterranean terror and burrows through
absurd yet fertile earth, as it takes the silly premise and turns it into a genre hit despite its hilarious nature. In this humorous battle of rednecks vs. mutated worms, the viewer gets his money's worth, as the film is a fun ride from start to finish that knows to satisfy him with everything in its power. From innovative, monstrous, antagonistic invertebrates that are as smart as they are smelly, over an unexpectedly clever plot that consists of innumerable ideas that keep the audience from becoming bored, a more or less likable bunch of main characters to effectively used, slimy and suspenseful visual effects, the film has everything it needs to be a highly entertaining genre flick. Even if it isn't the showpiece example of fine acting, the story is still built up well, the dialogue is surprisingly defined by extreme wit, and most importantly, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Without a doubt, this desert version of ""Jaws"" is a highly delighting, astonishingly atmospheric horror gem from the early nineties that is a must see for every fan of the genre.",Tremors
103,Coffee_in_the_Clink,A defining horror film of the 1990s,8,21 May 2020,"The 1980s saw the rise of the slasher film to become the dominant feature of the horror genre. The advent of VHS and the straight-video-market around this time variably led to the genre being effectively washed-out with an over-abundance of low-budget and poorly made slasher films being produced. What would the 1990s have in store for horror, so? Many would have believed much of the same, or else the genre was going to burn itself out and we would return to an era similar to the 1940s when the genre was in danger of fizzling out after a big heyday. ""Tremors"" came out in 1990 and it was a refreshing and welcoming arrival. Blending an equal amount of horror and comedy, the film managed to pull it off and is a hilarious and action-packed creature-feature that beautifully plays homage to the monster movies of the 1950s.Val and Earl (Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward) are a pair of handymen living and working in Perfection, Nevada, a small settlement in the middle of the desert with a population of 14. While driving the roads one day they come across a resident of their small town dead, and in a strange position. Then they come across a grad-student conducting seismology tests in the area; detecting strange tremors underground. She has no idea what could be causing this, but soon it becomes apparent that there are giant mutant worms living under the desert, and they are hungry. Effectively sharks of the desert, they are quick and powerful, and the small town of Perfection soon becomes cut off from the outside world and must take a stand against them...Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a superb pairing here and really bounce off each other with the banter very well. The rest of the cast are just as enjoyable to watch, and the small town of Perfection is a real delight to behold, very quirky and charming. The giant worms look fantastic; somewhat cheap, but they have a real appeal about them, and the gore is great. This film really evokes the atmosphere of 1950s desert-set horror creature films such as ""Them!"" and ""Tarantula"", and makes an excellent homage. It never takes itself too seriously, but doesn't go over the line of being outrageous, either. Few films blend horror and comedy so well. ""Tremors"" re-booted the horror genre as the '90s began, and we would see a move away from the slashers that had suffocated the genre in the last few years of the '80s.",Tremors
104,jb_campo,Classic sci-fi flick. Love it!,8,12 June 2014,"I recently rewatched Tremors for at least the 6th time, and it never gets old. It reminds me of movies I watched when I was a kid growing up in the 60s, like The Killer Mantis or Mothra. The story is just so outlandishly stupid, you will almost die yourself of laughter as you see citizens of the town of Perfection, Nevada slowly get churned up by giant underground worms.The cast of characters is what really makes Tremors a winner. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, as Val and Earl, will have your sides splitting with their silly dialog and actions. If you were to imagine a town with a population of 14 in the middle of nowhere Nevada, these are the kind of people you would expect to live there. Val and Earl are downright losers, who dream of getting out of Perfection, to Bixby, a mere 38 miles away. Wow, what aspirations - you losers. And they play the roles to perfection.When Rhonda (Finn Carter) comes on the scene as a grad research student, uh oh, Val's heart goes a flutter. Rhonda is a geology student doing research, and her motion sensor equipment is showing some pretty strange readings. At the same time, Val and Earl have just decided they really are moving out of Perfection, but unfortunately, they just can't get away as bodies start piling up.The movie segues nicely to the battle between the monsters and the town, but not before Michael Gross and Reba McIntyre get introduced as the survivalists who are preparing for World War 3 with every weapon imaginable in their basement. There is a scene where you get to see those weapons in action that will have you just laughing non-stop for about 2 minutes. Just incredible B-grade movie-making at its best!The film moves along with a cat and mouse game between the survivors and the monsters until the final climax where your major reaction may just be the same as mine - yeeeeccchh! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll scream, heck, you might even fall out of your seat watching this movie.This movie is a sci-fi classic, kind of borrowing from Rocky Horror Picture Show, and The Thing. I enthusiastically recommend Tremors.",Tremors
105,geminiredblue,They're Under The Ground!!!,9,22 February 2012,"I would like to start my review by saying that I believe this is one of the most under-appreciated scifi/horror thrillers ever made. What's not to like about it? You've got a stellar cast, with two good ole boy heroes played by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. Their banter alone is some of the wittiest ever written. Both actors play their parts in a down-home, matter-of-fact way that makes us love them from frame one. And the supporting cast equally matches them for intelligence and wit. So now the story: For no particular reason, one day in Perfection, NV, people start disappearing or turning up dead. Before too long, the townspeople discover that they're cut off from civilization... but what is causing this? And what's with all those weird subterranean rumblings? The answer: Giant earthworms that they eventually come to call Graboids. But keep in mind that these aren't your garden-variety giant critters. As the movie progresses, to everyone's horror, the Graboids learn and change their tactics. Essentially, it's an updated homage to the giant animal films of the 50s, but with a solid, constant sense of humor about it.

It's a fight for survival as the townspeople must find higher ground and avoid becoming soulfood for the bizarre creatures.""Tremors"" is essentially a homage to the monster movies of the 1950's, and it works, firing on all cylinders and never failing to entertain. The creatures are gruesome and strange, while the characters are often wacky and eccentric. Obviously the film is carried by solid performances from Bacon and Ward, but at the core, the creatures are the stars and truth be told, nothing quite like them has appeared in a movie like ""Tremors."" Most importantly, though, the film moves at such a brisk pace that it never sags or loses momentum, giving it unlimited replay value.The film inspired a string of direct-to-DVD sequels that were unnecessary and failed to capture the thrill of the original. Even still, though, its reputation is still that of an enjoyable and energetic monster mash with a host of fun performances. A film that never gets old, and in many ways, is vastly under-rated, ""Tremors"" is a roller-coaster ride you'll want to take again and again.",Tremors
108,freaky_dave,A nice surprise,8,15 March 2010,"Tremors is one of the better horror movies to come out of the 90s. It's really hard to call it horror because there is a lot of humor as well, and all the characters are engaging and seemed to have had a good time making this movie.THere's a small isolated town in Nevada where the population is 14. There is only one road that leads out of the town and because it is surrounded by mountains radio waves don't reach so far. Its the perfect set up for a monster movie, and it is a rare monster movie that actually works for the most part because of all the engaging characters and the set up which leads to a good payoff. You actually don't see the first creature until more than 30 minutes in, and the movie itself is only about 90 minutes long. The director, Ron Underwood, realizes that a movie works most effectively when there is build up before the big reveal, and what a reveal it is.Outside of the build up, the actors make this film work best with witty dialoque and great chemistry. The two main characters Val and Earl, played wonderfully by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, keep the show interesting and are helped a great deal by secondary characters which are just as good. My two favorites outside Val and Earl would be Burt, played by Michael Gross, and Heather, played by Reba McEntire of country music fame, who are a gun happy couple ready to take on anything that comes their way. In fact, as one of the other characters says, they are prepared for World War III.The pacing is great, and because this is a character driven monster movie, everything flows smoothly and never becomes boring. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. The actors, and the director himself, seemed to enjoy making this wonderful movie.Some people will complain about the special effects, which are a bit dated twenty years later, but those creatures, which seemed rubbery then, still work in my opinion. THere is never an explanation of where they came from, but in the movie the characters have their own theories of where they might have come from. It doesn't matter though because it is all in good fun.THis is a B movie film that works better than most B film movies ever do.

Enter Rhonda, a university student and geologist who is studying rocks and stuff in the desert who is getting some crazy readings from the earth, however, this don't trouble old Val and Earl as they have made their minds up that they are leaving perfection and heading for the big city! Yee-haw! However, unfortunately for them they planned on leaving the town just one day to late as four giant underground monsters show up determined to reduce the population of perfection to zero! In this fantastic monster comedy there are a number of points that go in the films favour, the first being the amazing pairing of Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, I mean they act like they've been best friends for years, bicker like an old married couple and it is these performances that carry what could have been a mediocre film on it's shoulders. Don't get me wrong, the film is good but this really helps.The other thing that makes the film work is the monsters themselves. The director Ron Underwood wisely chooses to carry the film with us hardly seeing the monsters, but unlike other films that do this it does not make the film seem cheap. When we need to see them in some key dramatic and exciting moments we see them, when we don't need to, we don't. This of course is in the days before excessively used CG when directors had to use clever cuts and suggestion rather than infinitely deep pockets and 12 computers rendering.The script is top drawer and when my family and I saw this film the lines became so instantly quotable that after a week of watching and rewatching we were throwing out the various superb lines for any and every occasion, this is what makes it a must for film buffs (And geeks, and I humbly include myself in that bracket) This is another of my underrated filums that I always feel is unjustly marked down because people just don't know it. But I tell you this, if I had to choose between this and Iron Man, I'd pick this any day of the week! High praise indeed!",Tremors
120,tom_koopa,Excellent movie in a lot of areas!,9,4 May 2009,"I've always loved this film to bits! Let's talk about the good things first.Acting: Couldn't be better! There's a very strong chemistry between Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. As the two lead characters, they do their job very well. You'll grow fond of the dialog at some parts of the movie and may want to rewind and listen to it again. Michael Gross is also very present in this movie as the trigger-happy Burt Gummer (who appears in all four Tremors movies). The rest of the cast are mainly town folk (with the exception of the lovely Rhonda LeBeck, played by Finn Carter) who have to either fight for their lives or die trying. They all do a good job though, despite being 'just' town folk.Story: Okay, it's a little far-fetched, but this IS a monster movie. Giant worms have found their way to this little town called 'Perfection' (haha) in Nevada. Attracted by sound (to be precise, vibrations), they hunt the local livestock AND villagers. Two passer-by's are now trapped in the valley and have to work together with these people to defeat the underground creatures. The story develops slowly, yet steadily and once the action kicks in, it doesn't stop.Effects: Very effective! There are some very good scenes. You will be scared... or at least be startled for a moment. The worms are well crafted and look real enough. Of course, by today's standards, you would probably be disappointed a little bit; but you have to keep in mind that this movie is from 1990, which is 'old' if you compare it with today's cinematic technology.Music: Works! The total score of this movie is very fitting for the atmosphere. Enjoyable, soothing country music. You either love or hate it. Sometimes, there's no music, which helps to intensify those spooky scenes very well.I have only one complaint about this movie: It's only 96 minutes long! It's over before you know it! You'd wish there was more as the credits roll in, really. Then again, it's perfect for a quick movie if you don't want to spend a whole evening watching something.In conclusion, Tremors is an excellent movie in it's genre. Highly recommended for any fan of monster movies with some depth. (no pun intended)",Tremors

122,Chromium_5,One of the most entertaining movies ever made.,8,21 September 2004,"This movie is an absolute blast. A couple times it actually had me on the edge of my seat. It's not exactly a horror movie, but it has its scary moments (like when the worms are going for the little girl on the pogo stick... yikes). The worms are not quite as cool-looking as the cover would have you believe, but I still wouldn't want those things coming after me.Interestingly, unlike most movies in the giant-animals-attacking-small-towns genre, this one actually had me rooting for the humans. I really, really wanted to see Kevin Bacon and friends defeat these things. Of course, the movie is made that much more fun by the near-impossible odds of any of them getting out of the town alive. This is the tiniest, most pathetic town ever portrayed on film. There is virtually NO WAY to escape from it, and the monsters are every bit as smart as the humans. What are they going to do!?I know this is mainly a spoof, and it does have some hilarious parts (""You broke into the wrong godd#mn rec room!""), but I enjoyed it most because of the constant suspense. ""Tremors"" is the most exciting, entertaining movie I have seen in a good long while. I can't recommend it enough.8/10 stars.",Tremors

There are some pretty suspenseful moments as well and the film is overall really fun.
Also worth noting is that I actually think that the Graboids look really good and and are in my opinion among the most iconic monsters of cinema.

124,troy-daniel-bush,Self-awareness to enjoy over and over again!,10,12 October 2021,"One of my Top 5 favorite movies!A little context first: This is a movie that has always been a part of my life. I grew up with it. I associate it with my dad who taped it for me as a surprise and watched it with me whenever I felt like it. And I felt like it a lot. It traumatized me when I was a kid and even though it led to many sleepless nights, I enjoyed getting scared by this movie. There are scenes in this movie that continue to give me chills to this day.It doesn't try to be anything that it isn't. It's a simple, cheesy throwback and it knows it is. I mean, look at the poster.It's about an hour and forty minutes long but it feels like an hour.All the characters are likable, but some are more memorable than others.The chemistry between Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward is very watchable.Most of the acting is great.There are a lot of clever set-ups with satisfying payoffs.There's minimal gore but the gore that's in it is very satisfying. In particular, that basement scene.The creatures are kept a secret until thirty minutes into the film. It's like JAWS but in the desert.The cinematography is awesome! The Worm POV shots are creepy!The creature effects are super well-done, but what do you expect from the people who did the effects for Terminator and Aliens? And even though you can see the practical effect each of them is charming, certainly a lot more charming than dated CG, and none of them distract from the experience. However, there is one composite shot that does not look great but you forget about it right away and there is something charming about that, as well.There are some genuinely scary moments. And the majority of them take place during the day.The creature design is awesome! (One of the best I've ever seen!) They look like something that could exist, which makes them scary!The creatures themselves feel like a threat! I mean, they're only visible when they want to be, always hungry, are fast, are strong, are quick learners, and have the perfect hunting method.The rewatch value is insane!There's quotable dialogue.It's cheesy, has some dumb lines, the swearing can feel unrealistic at times, there are some inconsistencies and plot conveniences, some noticeably bad ADR, and some of the acting is stilted, but this movie doesn't take itself super seriously so all that stuff is forgivable.This is a fun monster movie with plenty of satisfying, funny, and scary scenes that you'll want to revisit time and time again. And it should be a lesson to young aspiring filmmakers. Whether it's your first movie or your tenth, keep it simple, but wring everything you can out of the premise.",Tremors

With the likes of Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Michael Gross, Finn Carter, Ariana Richards and more, Tremors is one of the best movies ive seen and IS the best horror/comedy/sci-fi movie to ever grace the screen. I'll never get bored of this movie. Never. Although it isnt gory, it has that way of making you think the first time you see it: I better not make a sound or the Graboids will get me!

They eat whatever they hear that is on the ground and the only survivors that can maybe live are the smart ones. Boulders and rocks are the only things that can keep a Grabboid from eating you.Don't get to itchy when you watch this, the reason I say that is because Val Mckee(Kevin Bacon) is hot.

A monster movie that mixed humor and horror together. At the start of Tremors, we are introduce by two unlikely characters who are handymen. They are played by Kevin Bacon and Fred Award. The film takes place in a Nevada desert town called Perfection. Perfection is one of those small towns where everybody knows everybody and settles in between open fields. But, something is going on around Perfection that isn't quite right. The handymen realizes that sheep are slaughtered and a person is missing. They soon find out that underground giant worms are tunneling underground, underneath Perfection. After escaping twice from the ferocious creatures, they tries to warn the others about the worms. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are great together in this movie that stirs even more humor from the two. Another reason why Tremors is a good movie is that a performance by Micheal Gross, who plays Burt Gummer, the survivalist who has a basement full of guns that he actually empties out to kill the worms.

It knows exactly what it is, and I don't think there is anything wrong with praising a movie for knowing it is a dumb horror comedy.

132,mitchell5954,One of My Favorite Monster Movies!,10,25 August 2013,"Tremors is definitely one of my favorite monster movies. It is not artsy or deep and it is not supposed to be. Tremors is meant to be a fun popcorn film, and it definitely succeeds in that. The characters are fun, the creatures look great, the action scenes are well done, and the film has a great look.First of all the character are great. The film stars Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward). These two have amazing chemistry together and their banter is very fun to listen to. They are hired hands living in the small town of Perfection, Nevada. They decide to leave to pursue better careers elsewhere. However, as they do people are being killed by large underground creatures that are later named Graboids.The other big characters are Ronda (Finn Carter) who is a college student studying vibrations in the ground and is Val's love interest in the film. Another big character is Burt Gummer (Michael Gross), who is very paranoid and has tons of weapons in his house. He is my favorite character in the film and of the entire franchise. His wife is played by Reba McEntire, who is does great as well. She also has a song played during the end credits which I enjoy listening to.The effects for this film are top notch. The creatures actually look really good especially for a film that came out in 1990. I like the design for the creatures. I find it to be a very unique design. The premise is very much like a B-movie. I like that it does not take itself too seriously. This film took a ridiculous premise and had fun with it. I also like the location. I have seen few monster movies that take place in a location quite like this. The action scenes are also fun and can be suspenseful.Overall, Tremors is an extremely fun monster movie. It has great characters, cool creatures, great effects, and great atmosphere. I think it is one of the most underrated horror/monster movies out there.",Tremors

139,knsevy,"For all you know, they can fly",10,29 March 2004,"**VIBRATING SPOILERS**This is a great movie and a fun ride. They went back to the basics and came out with one of my all-time favorite flicks.There are two ways to make a good monster movie: slow-paced and suspenseful, or fast-paced and surprising. Tremors definitely opts for the latter method. The producers also managed to assemble an excellent cast, all of whom establish their invidual characters with admirable clarity. Only Mindy, the young girl, comes off as kind of a cipher. Plus, with the exception of Kevin Bacon and Michael Gross, they all look like REAL people.The spotlight gets shared out pretty equally among the cast, as well. One particularly nice touch was the fact that our two main heroes weren't the only people in town who have any competency, at all. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon DO carry the movie, but it's more because of the great screen chemistry between them. Miguel has the better ideas, and Burt contributes more to the actual destruction of the monsters.While Tremors never really 'cheats' the audience, i.e. sets up a situation and then doesn't deliver, the movie does vary teasingly from the expected. One of the aspects I enjoy most about showing this film to first-time viewers - aside from the the pride I take in indoctrinating new members to the Cult of the Graboid - is how the movie fools them about things like who gets eaten and who doesn't, and how the worms actually operated.My one bullsh*t call is the Cat loader. Any operator with any kind of experience could have used the loader bucket to lever the tractor up and out of the pit it fell into, and that impact wouldn't have knocked out the engine. Whether they could have pulled themselves out before the Graboids yanked them off the tractor is less certain (Every time I see the scene of Burt Gummer falling from the loader to the ground, I cringe and think: there's a stuntman with two broken ankles).I also could have used more Victor Wong and less Reba McEntire. She's just hard to listen to, as an actress. As little as she contributes after Burt and Heather shoot up the Graboid in their basement, they could have fed HER to the monsters and let Walter Chang survive.Ah, well. YOU try telling a Graboid who it can't eat.Oh, and I love Val & Earl's truck. I think it's a late-60s Jeep J10 Warrior. Absolutely indestructible.",Tremors

141,CaressofSteel75,Graboids!!,9,12 July 2014,"You can argue that there was a latter-day golden age of B movies in Hollywood that ran from the late 1970s to the mid 1980s. Take a look at Halloween, Escape From New York, The Warriors, etc. Tremors came after all that chronologically, and it's a little lighter type of a movie, but it definitely deserves to be mentioned as part of that golden age- and it may even be the best of those movies.Tremors is great in its tone, concept, it's sense of humor and its casting. It's a perfect send up to 1950s sci fi that most people probably thought couldn't be done by 1990. Luckily for us, they still had a little of that magic left for this one. Unfortunately, Tremors is really the last of those types of movies. You can kind of feel the old Hollywood riding off into the sunset at the end of this film.",Tremors
142,jiangliqings,"Genre fans and casual moviegoers will find lots of things to love in Tremors, possibly the best horror/comedy ever made.",10,29 September 2001,"*** 1/2 out of **** Tremors is often described by many to be a cult classic, which is odd.  The fact is, cult films usually have a quirky quality to them that separate them from the usual Hollywood-churned machine.  Take Re-Animator, for example, or even the recent Ravenous, both of which have oddities and bloody quirks that average viewers might find repellant.  But Tremors isn't the slightest bit offbeat.  It's made in full Hollywood-style with a predictably happy ending to boot.  So what makes it a ""cult classic""?  Could it be that it's successful in mixing almost every genre into the proceedings or that it's great entertainment that simply didn't get the box office reception it deserved?  Perhaps both, because this is one movie that always puts a smile on my face and simultaneously gets my pulse-pounding every time I watch it. The plot is similar to that of the monster films of the old days. Valentine Mckee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Fred Ward) are two handymen ""trapped"" in the small town of Perfection, Nevada.  They have dreams of making it big, but their ambitious goals always seem out of reach.  Just when they do decide to finally leave, the discovery of dead bodies, both human and animal, keep them there for just a while longer.  There's also the road, which has been blocked by a large boulder. On hand to study some strange seismic activity is Rhonda (Finn Carter), a grad student who helps Mckee and Bassett come to the realization that both the deaths and the odd vibrations in the ground are connected.  It turns out to be the work of giant 30-foot worms, four of them to be exact, and they trap the townspeople of Perfection in their homes, including gun-happy, WWIII-prepared couple Burt and Heather Gummer (Michael Gross and Reba Mcentire).  The rest of the film becomes a desperate scramble to outsmart the worms and get out of the town alive.The first thing that's noticable about Tremors is probably how it's obviously inspired by 50's monster flicks.  The great thing, though, is that Tremors plays itself as a comedy, preferring laughs over scares, a wise decision since if the film took itself seriously, it would have been a major detriment.  The laughs aren't cheap, either, as they result from witty dialogue and new twists on the ""monster"" subgenre.  The great chemistry between Bacon and Ward brings the most humor to the film.  Playing best friends with little education but plenty of smarts, these are two performances that are a hoot to watch.  It'd be great to see them in another film together again (too bad it didn't happen in Tremors 2). But in addition to the laughs, there's also the action, which is frenetic and exciting.  Director Ron Underwood gives the film a lightning pace and the 95 minutes seems to just roll by.  The fun action consists of a lot of running and ""get off the ground"" moments.   For the last 45 minutes, Tremors is almost full of non-stop excitement, and it's surprising to see that the action never gets tiresome nor dull for a single moment.  The movie isn't scary or frightening at all, but with suspense and thrills this sharp, who cares (Besides, being scary is hardly the film's intent.)?It's nice to see that this movie is not particularly gory or full of gratuitous violence.  While I do enjoy gory violence when it fits the style and tone, it wouldn't have been welcome here and the light-hearted feel that permeates Tremors is a crucial reason to its success; there's no unneccessary unpleasantness and it also proves that the movie creates genuine excitement without resorting to splashing blood all over the screen. Because of this, it easily reaches out to a larger amount of viewers, making it a movie that's just as easily accessible for fans of, say, screwball comeides as it is for action lovers. Since the movie is PG-13, there are still a couple of moments of semi-graphic violence, but nothing objectionable to someone 10 years or older.The special effects are fun, with the worms as the film's showpiece. Thankfully, there's no overdone CGI and the worms are actually well-rendered and convincing.  But I must say, I was a little misled, seeing how it is the worms don't actually look like the one on the video box cover (which actually looks cooler).  But never mind that, I'm wondering how the director managed to pull off so many scenes of the creatures popping out from underground.  I mean, given the fact that this is a goofy monster movie, it couldn't have been given a very big budget.  I also love those worm POV shots, particularly the ones that actually feature the camera wading through the dirt. S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock's script is clever without being particulary intelligent or distinguished.  This isn't a brilliant film by a long shot but it goes to show that some writers who just want to write a fun script can actually get the job done.  It's a little odd to note that all of Wilson and Maddock's other screenplays (with maybe the exception of Tremors' own sequels) have been pretty bad, culminating to the debacle known as Wild Wild West.  Unlike that film and the others they've written, this one isn't soulless. But it's not the action and the laughs that put this film above so many countless movies of the genre.  It is, after all, the characters that make this film as highly entertaining as it is.  As said before, Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward's chemistry is natural and they deliver some of their best acting in their careers.  It's actually a shame that Ward never reached the same heights of stardom as Bacon; he sure as hell had the charisma and acting skill for it.  Also very good is Finn Carter as Rhonda, and it's also a little unfortunate her career hasn't gone far since this.  She and Bacon also have some nice chemistry, which further establishes this movie as one that also works partially as a romance (a good feat, considering it's not even striving to be one).  The other standouts are Michael Gross and Reba Mcentire as the gun-toting couple.  Their performances are a lot of fun and there's a hilarious scene involving the two of them trying to kill one of the giant worms in their basement. Tremors wasn't much of a box office success but has since gone on to have a strong life on video, to the point where it even inspired other knowingly goofy creature features such as Anaconda, Lake Placid, Deep Blue Sea, and Deep Rising (of these three, only Rising comes to mind as a must see).  None of them managed to reach the heights of Tremors, perhaps because their characters weren't as likable and memorable, thus leaving this film as the one all future monster films will be compared to.  The film's also got its own sequels, the first of which I remember as being pretty fun but certainly inferior.  Tremors 3 I have yet to see, but it's one I'm looking forward to.",Tremors
143,Phillemos,"Oh, so THIS is why nobody lives in rural Nevada",8,25 November 2006,"You watch some horror/sci-fi movies and realize how little effort the actors put into their parts and how much contempt they have for being in it. Not here. ""Tremors"" is nothing if not fun. And everyone in the movie, while running from carnivorous worms that spring from the ground, suck people under and eat them, looks like they're having the time of their lives. The movie pays homage to the old '50s giant creature movies. The plot is also somewhat reminiscent of ""Blood Beach"" but set in a small town in rural Nevada instead of oceanside. And it's done with much more pizazz than ""Blood Beach,"" too. There is some effort given to special effects. The plot is set up better, without needless side stories. But the cast is what makes this movie. Kevin Bacon gives his usual spunky, horror movie performance. But the country music lady and the father from ""Family Ties,"" who play a married couple here, nearly steal the show with their one-liners and his obsession with explosives -- which comes in handy quite a bit in this movie. My one complaint: at times ""Tremors"" can't decide whether it wants to be a serious horror movie or a parody and it kind of drifts from one to the other and back. But overall this is one of the best monster movies of the 90s. A solid 8.",Tremors
144,cwbellor,Graboids try to bite Kevin's Bacon!,9,22 March 2018,"Kevin Bacon plays redneck handyman Val, a performance that is surprisingly profound in that it makes you realize one thing. Kevin Bacon doesn't play rednecks nearly enough! Val is in a completely hetero relationship with Earl, played by Fred Ward. Despite the potential for a Brokeback Desert romance, these two handsy men have their sights set on one thing and that's money. Apparently, one of America's most desolate regions is the place to seek a fortune even if you're not an oil prospector. 
Bacon and Ward meet seismologist and quickly become pole-vaulting pals. That's when they realize that there's a bad case of the shakes in the desert. They retreat to the hamlet of Pefection where we have charming characters like Melvin, the boy who cries Graboid. Then there's Walter, the cute little Asian store owner. Then we have Burt, a gun-loving man's man who is as true blue as Uncle Sam's poo. But even Burt isn't prepared for the subterranean beasts as we see one burst into his basement with phallic ferociousness. When these monsters aren't puking up pogo sticks, they're chomping on Chinese as Walter is the first of the townsfolk to go down to subterranean town. After this sorrowful scene, you'll find yourself hoping this film isn't so insensitive that the next target would be the other minority character Miguel. Luckily Miguel is around to spout such wisdom as, ""Hey, so like we don't vibrate, right?""Reba rages, cars sink, sheep get shanked and pole vaulters make a mad dash for a dozer! This movie is a mega monster fun feast!",Tremors
145,Rattrap007,Stay off the ground!!!,8,22 January 2002,"A great take on the old monster movies. The story follows two handymen who are just getting ready to leave their very small town and head for greener pastures. But a series of events prevents this from happening. The small town of about 12 people is now under attack by giant 30 foot man eating worm like creatures.
The charachters are well done. We get Val and Earl. The bicker and argue with each other. The settle all their problems through rock paper scissors. We get Burt and his wife. They have a basement full of guns and ammo incase of WWIII.  And we get Rhonda the student researcher.The movie is well paced and very funny. One of the best 'horror' films that has been released in the past 12 years. I give it a 8/10.",Tremors
146,super marauder,The Perfect Drive-in movie!,9,19 October 2002,"This is another movie I had at the drive-in that I managed. I felt this movie was made for drive-in theaters. It reminded me of the old Burt I. Gordon movies that I saw on late night t.v. only done better.The plot is much like the old 50s horror movies. Instead of giant spiders, of flying saucers, we're treated to smelly, stinky, underground flesh eating slugs. The plot is simple, these monsters are terrorizing this small town in the middle of nowhere, and the town's people have to try to figure out how to kill the monsters, and stay alive in the process. Of course, a few of them get munched along the way.  The characters really make this one for me. Val, and Earl (played by Kevin Bacon, ant the underrated Fred Ward) played great off of each other. You had Michael Gross, and Reba McIntyre as the survivalists Burt, and Heather. All of the characters were likeable, including Melvin, the squeaky voiced teenager who in a back story, the town looked after. The movie could be called a horror-comedy. You laughed at the funny parts, but at the same time you jumped out of your seat at the scary parts. This was just a fun movie, that never took itself too seriously.
The second, and third installments were in my opinion were just as good, even though the original cast gradually dwindled down to Michael Gross.What more can I say, this just a fun little movie, that's it!",Tremors
147,DorianWynHowells,"I really, really, DIG this film!!!",9,8 February 2002,"Tremors. Great concept, great acting, amazing SFX and there's more to be had besides.I saw this film years ago, oh god years ago, and I immediately went out and bought it. This is a horror/action flick which delivers.The tremors of the title are these worms, or 'graboids' that live and hunt underneath the ground, and they are the villains of the film.The action takes place in, and around Perfection, Nevada, where it's population is roughly 13. Of these are 'Handy Men' Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward). Ward and Bacon evoke a Butch and Sundance relationship here, and they work well off each other. I like the nice touches that run through the entire film - who has the cigarettes? Who has the lighter? Let's settle this with scissors, paper, rock. All nice little touches to an already great film.The film also boasts a strong performance from Finn Carter as the beautiful Rhonda. She is intelligent enough to help get everyone to safety, and defeat the worms, and boy is she beautiful! A natural beauty!People will lap this film up for it's amazing, and not forced, mixture of horror, comedy, and romance.The first few scenes when the worms attack, are terrifying, as we don't know what's going on - it's far scarier when you can't see the killer! But even when they are in the open, we don't laugh, 'cause they look very real. Great SFX.The shoot out in Burt's basement is also great - very loud though!!Well, there's nothing more I want to say except for - WATCH THIS FILM!!!! It's pretty damn near 'PERFECTION'!!!

149,ColeSear,Worth Seeing (Spoilers),10,14 August 2002,"Tremors is without a doubt a very surprising and very fun film that is likely to be enjoyed by a wide variety of filmgoers. It's an hour and a half of escapist cinema that is both funny and engrossing at the same time. Upon first glance this might seem like the kind of film you've seen a thousand times before but it is definitely worth a closer look. The first few minutes of the film seem to set a tone of a schlocky take off comedy that isn't going to offer much in the way of content. However, the groundwork for the fore-coming events are laid very well during the comedy dominant portion of the film. The rest of the film is an intricate balance between humor and science fiction elements. When the inciting incident occurs the old man is found perched high about the desert on power lines the movie starts to move quicker. The pace of this film from there on out is fantastic and then the beginning no longer feels out of place. A great asset to this tale is the ensemble cast which is often preferable in such a tale as this but rarely well utilized. In this group of characters we definitely have our central characters defined and in the forefront. While the secondary characters are sketched in broad strokes they are each individuals and do not seem like stereotypes. However, an ensemble of unique quirky characters would be nothing without a good cast and Tremors boasts that as well. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward play best friends who appear to be quite similar and therein lie their conflicts. These two carry the film throughout but whereas with many films the two lead actors wandering through the plot complications may get bothersome they get help along the way. Michael Gross formerly of ""Family Ties"" is great and absolutely hysterical in a supporting role and Reba McEntire always seems to be a service in a small and over the top part not to mention that she adds quite a catchy tune to the closing credits. This film draws upon a few cinematic techniques to make it effective. Firstly, the use of the subjective camera along the ground to represent the ""snakeoids"" worked very well to create suspense and tension. For quite sometime the filmmakers also decided not to reveal the creature knowing that the fear (if it in fact caused fear) of the unknown was the greatest fear of all. Those involved in making Tremors made the unusual decision to have most of their action take  place during the day time in which it is very difficult to create an effective horror film  but the way in which they used the ingeniously simple concept of being trapped makes all the suspense elements work. Aside from being tremendously funny and having an amazing score at the climax along with an equally interesting climax Tremors succeeds in two very interesting methods both illustrated by the way these creatures attack. First, in a very unique way I felt this film took the fear of being buried alive and elevated it to new heights by blending it with ghoulishness and at the same time without being grotesque allowing the thought to stay in the imagination. It's a very interesting concept which I would like to see a straightforward horror film take on sometime. Aside from dealing greatly with the concept of being trapped which is always a great premise to go with in the horror/sci-fi genre Tremors also deals with a seemingly insurmountable opponent which has an unstoppable method of attack, the snakeoids being sensitive to seismic vibrations would obviously eventually kill these people it seems. It is a perfect setup for a Nightmare on elm Street- type ending but the original filmmakers didn't go for the sequel and truly came up with an ingenious way for out heroes to be victorious which is sure to please. While Tremors is undoubtedly based and inspired on the science fiction films of the 1950s I think it's no accident that it was produced and came out towards the end of the cold war. It is never affirmed what makes these creatures the way they are but the idea of residual radiation at the end of the arms race is something that may also have been an implied message from this film. Tremors is, however, a film you take away whatever you brought to it there is no heavy-handed attempt at a message and if you just want to have fun you most definitely will although considering that the sci-fi films of the 50s always had some sort of message it's something to consider. One notable deviation I noticed from the 1950s Sci-Fi formula. Tremors is a film about fun but it did seem that Bert (Michael Gross) and Heather Gummer (Reba McEntire) were exaggerated to fit the liberal interpretation of countryside conservatives as card-carrying NRA members with an artillery in their basement. Any commentary in this regard and/or rebuttal against it is veiled in humor and is used to serve the plot and doesn't seem to be an unnecessary catechism about socio-political norms. This film never takes itself that seriously and it's all the better for it. Whether it's a spoof or an updating, thriller or comedy you can't help but love Tremors. Whatever it takes it's inspiration from it manages to be a film that stands alone and is unique in its own way. It's definitely worth seeing.",Tremors
150,crash21,Comedy in a very different way,3,7 March 2016,"I can't watch this movie without laughing at the incredible stupidity of it. The movie has practically nothing more than a few desert neighbors running from some kind of unbelievable man-eating worms. It's a lot like a unique version of the so-believable ""Jaws"". There isn't much to the story, they stay in practically the same area through the whole movie and, with a few scene differences here and there, they fight against giant worms coming out of the ground, using giant desert rocks as their safety zone.The lines to the whole movie are a couple of people talking once in a while, and the rest is nothing but screams from people in the scene. Nothing really happens in this whole movie, it's rather boring and completely unbelievable. The worms attack them on top of a mobile home, yet they can drive a bulldozer pulling a trailer and the worms only get to the people after they stop moving? And their whole win against the worms is by having them eat and blow themselves up using the pipe-bombs that they have had through all of this.The movie is just plain ridiculous, and boring.",Tremors
151,AsifZamir,Epic Monster Movie of the 1990s,10,13 November 2013,"Tremors is an amazing sci-fi horror-thriller cast in the 1990s. Yes I've watched it many times and I'll watch it many more times. I don't think anyone can remake this movie properly. Directed by Ron Underwood, Tremors takes place in Perfection Nevada, a bleak small town. Two country handy-men, Val McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Basset (Fred Ward) have decided it's time to depart Perfection, but, alas; diverse tremblings start to shake the earth. A seismology student (Finn Carter) joins this pair to find out what's happening. They soon find out giant worm like creatures, that are man-eaters, are wreaking havoc.Tremors led to three straight to video sequels and one television series which composed of thirteen episodes in the 2003 season. Writers of Tremors were S.S Wilson, Brent Maddock, and Ron Underwood.Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward do a fun, witty, elementary job in their acting styles portrayed in Tremors. They work well together and keep up the humour. Finn Carter adds to the fun in helping hunt down the worms. This movie is a must-see.

Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are perfect as a couple of hicks who stumble on some killer, gigantic worms that would make any horror monster from the 60's as scary as the Easter Bunny. There happen to several of these killer worms and throughout the film they terrorize a bunch of red necks in a small Nevada town. I thought one of the funniest scenes is when they hack of one of the worm's tentacles and they bring it back to the genral store and they actually have their kids photographed with it! Talk about commercialism at it's worst. I also love it when Fred's character thinks he's being pulled down by one of the worms and it winds up being a prairie dog burough. I love Reba MacIntyre's character too, a chick who with her husband, own an entire arsonal in their basement, including an elephant gun. Outrageous! The little romance between Valentine and the College student is cute too. Spectacular entertainment! It really is a classic!",Tremors

Kevin Bacon always plays likable characters that you can believe in. He did well with this, even though I am sure critics think that this movie is horrible. I don't ever like things that the critics like, however, so I do not often give them any credence. The script is good and the acting good, too. For a horror movie, it was well thought-out and well directed. How many horror movies have good acting in them these days? Almost none.I especially like the desert scenes in this movie. I am curious to know if they filmed it in California or Nevada. The on-location scenes were very fun to watch on the big screen. If you have not seen this movie, give it a try.

The setting is fun and the set pieces are well designed, especially once they start getting destroyed.The characters are somewhat lacklustre with the exception of Kevin Bacon.

156,jmhammerstein-980-842586,wonderful movie,10,6 September 2016,Tremors is a wonderful movie. These people in a small remote town in Nevada start falling victim to killer whale-sized underground worm-like animals. These animals have tentacles that come out of their mouths and grab onto prey. The animals were not known to science before because they were in a place that had a very low population and where humans hadn't been for long. The animals are named Graboids in the movie. They're unrealistic because of how fast they are able to move through the ground. There is no way any animal could travel that fast through ground. It's too dense. But that doesn't ruin the movie at all. This is a great movie.,Tremors

The work of Ron Underwood can be described as correct and with some ability to print the story at a good pace.Even the effects, very rudimentary, are very good and sometimes even spectacular.I can only say that it is a film that really surprises for having more quality than you expect and for a story and actors that really work and make you have a great time.One of the last classics of the B series of the eighties-nineties totally recommended.",Tremors

159,rorymacveigh,Probably my most Poignant nightmare,9,6 August 2012,"I first watched this film back in about 2001 when I was only a wee child and the sight of people being eaten alive by quite convincing underground monsters made me lose trust in the earth I stood on and gave me weeks of nightmares. To this day, this film still gives me the creeps, but now I can see what a unique film it is. The main scare for me was because the film brought across the fact that these creatures seemed plausible and could possibly exist in some unknown region of the world, and for a frightened child, that was scary enough. I remember my dad telling me over and over again that there was 6 feet of concrete below the Living room floor so there was no way they could burrow up and attack. But still, it is a great film none the less.The story begins in a small desert town (if you can call it that) of Perfection, Nevada, where two Handymen, Val and Earl, are tired of their normal mundane lives and plan to leave for Las Vegas. On their way out of town, they come across the town drunk, who is found dead at the top of an Electricity Pylon, the cause of death is determined as dehydration, meaning he must have been up on the pylon for at least 3 days. As Val and Earl attempt to continue their voyage out of town, they come across a small farm where they find that all the sheep have been devoured and the only thing left of the farmer is his dismembered head lying in the dirt. Meanwhile, a pair of road-workers are mysteriously killed, and a landslide blocks off the only road out of Perfection Valley. As Val and Earl try to reverse their pickup truck to go back to town, they find themselves caught on something, and after forcing the truck to its limit, they manage to break free and return to town. Upon their return, they find a strange snake like creature wrapped around their rear axle. Without any way of contacting the outside world, Val and Earl attempt to leave the Valley on Horseback whilst local survivalists Burt and his wife Heather try to find the mysterious snake like creatures. Meanwhile that night, the local Doctor and his wife, who are slowly building a house for themselves in the desert, are mysteriously killed as the Doctor is dragged underground with the car keys and his wife is dragged underground in their car. The next day Val and Earl find their homestead abandoned and discover the car buried in the ground. As the pair set out across the desert, the mysterious snake creatures grapple their horses, but it is soon revealed that the snakes are merely the tongues of an even bigger monster that is up to 50 feet in length. Managing to evade their pursuer after it rams head on into a concrete aqueduct and knocks itself dead, the pair, with the help of a University Seismologist studying inexplicable seismic activity in the area, determine that there are up to 4 more of the creatures roaming the desert and they're all headed for town. With no way to escape, the townsfolk draw a line in the sand (no pun intended) and prepare to face off against the subterranean beasties to the very end...This film is amazingly unique, the main point being it manages to mix the humour with the horror, unlike most films which either swing too far one way or the other, this film finds a perfect balance. As a child I saw only the horror as I didn't understand the adult humour, but now that I do, I find the film more enjoyable to watch. It also has very good character development with some really enjoyable Three-Dimensional Characters rather than the 2D cut-outs that are usually found in other films. It's a definite recommendations for older audiences, but if you value a good night's sleep for either yourself or your children, send them to bed early and lock the living room door!",Tremors

That's why handymen Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward) have always planned to leave town. And this time they mean it. Suddenly a series of bizarre killings prevent them from leaving. With the help of a seismology student, they discover giant-worm like creatures living under the desert sand. Now their goal is to leave town in one piece.Critique: Lighthearted horror, sci-fi, comedy 'mish-mash' has an interesting premise, oddball characters, and wonderfully ferocious action. As our embattled heroes struggle to survive against the relentless creatures, the battle of wits that ensues becomes inventive and exciting. The film shares strange similarities with Spielberg's legendary 'Jaws'. As the suspense and body count mount, the threatening desert sand (water) becomes an infinite playground for the bloodthirsty worms (sharks), as they use scare tactics against their unbeknown victims (swimmers). Not knowing where they will strike next, people tiptoe their way across town trying not to alert the creatures. It all makes for 'TREMEndous' fun.",Tremors

Being made before visual effects became really sophisticated it has to rely on being imaginative, well shot, written and acted. It succeeds with the monster by not showing that much and what we do see is real enough to make it believable. The pace of the film is fast and this helps to maintain the suspense, I found myself caught up in the action and on the edge of my seat at times.The relationship between Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward works very well, it's funny and very down to earth, in fact all the acting is top notch.

They even creeped me out in the beginning during their first attacks. The special effects were excellent, and I liked how there wasn't any use of CGI. Nowadays, a good amount of monster movies seem to overuse CGI and you can tell how fake it looks. It's nice to know that for Tremors they wanted everything to be original.All the characters were good and seemed like real people in an unfortunate situation. The chemistry between Kevin Bacon (Valentine) and Fred Ward (Earl) was great, especially the witty banter between the two. Burt (Michael Gross) and Heather Gummer (Reba McEntire) were funny and provided a lot of comical moments. I liked the WWIII jokes they made considering earlier this year we were close to that happening.Usually films like this revolve around unintelligent people who make stupid decisions. Tremors is different because the characters work together and think smart to take down the creatures. However, the worms are just as smart and aren't your usual mindless eating machines with no brains. To me, this is a nice change of pace.Overall, I'll give Tremors a 9/10.

I have probably seen this film at least twenty times and I never get tired of it.As some have stated, on paper this film looks terrible but with a great cast and solid story and nearly non-stop action it never fails to entertain. Perhaps the best casting besides Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward as the local losers turned heroes are Michael Gross and Reba McEntire as Burt and Heather Gummer the gun toting survivalist of Perfection Valley. Michael Gross started this project a day after Family Ties stopped production and the transformation of the very liberal father in family ties to the ultraconservative Burt Gummer is a highlight of the film. Also Michael Gross is the only returning character in all of the sequels and the series. Unfortunately the sequels don't hold up as well as the originals and tend to be worse as the numbers increase. Tremors 2 features Fred Ward and Michael Gross and much slower and not as entertaining as the first. We do get to see the progression of the Graboids which helps the plot. Tremors 3 only feature returning member Michael Gross and again yet another version of the graboids...if only the movies stopped here. Tremors 4 is best avoided at all costs and is an old west prequel to the first movie....bad...bad...bad.Still you can't go wrong with the original, this would be on my list of Desert Island DVD's.",Tremors

This one started it all, with vibrations in the ground, stumbled upon by a grad student doing research in Perfection Valley. The cause? Giant underground worms with snake tongues that ""shoot out of its mouth, hook ya, and pull ya right in."" As dumb and corny as this sounds, it somehow comes together and works perfectly, with most of the credit going to Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward as the handyman duo, assisted by a strong supporting cast including Michael Gross and Reba McEntire. Hilarious dialogue, plenty of action, and a little suspense all add up to a great horror-comedy that almost anyone would enjoy.

There is action, romance, suspence, a lot of nice effects (not the most sofisticated but definatly more than enough for the purpose) and a lot of humor. This movie is definatly more exciting than most of the new ghost or monster movies (which I partly have complained about greatly in other reviews).I like the very friendly cooperation between the lead actors. You can tell they had a lot of fun making this movie together because they just work so very well on a natural level. This movie might be about a rather b-ish topic, but it is still not all too predictable nor does it ever get boring.

It's amazing how the producers and director brought everything together to make a very highly enjoyable horror flick.Of course, part of the greatness was the cast, who never came together for the forgettable ""Tremors"" sequels (except Ward and Gross); it was a real collection of good, good actors, a great, wry, quirky, twisty script, and everything just came together to create a wonderful experience for the viewer.This is one of those movies in which the sum is much greater than the parts; it all just clicks to keep you laughing and cringing by turns. I consider this to be one of the finest movies of the 1980s. When the writers do satire, it's understated, light, enjoyable satire; when they go for archetypes (such as the pair of traveling cowboys/handymen/screwups Val and Earl ably played by Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon - a clear echo of Howdy Lewis and Ben Jones in ""The Rounders""), they do so with originality and verve, and a fresh, light touch.There aren't any places where the plot drags - the action is taut and sustained; the producers and directors are almost Hitchcockian in their deftness with foreshadowing and suspense, then with sudden and startling plot twists. The humor is just enough to relieve the terror, but it's also great humor.Tremors is one of my all-time favorite movies. You could do a lot worse than watch it if you haven't yet. You'll thank me for it.",Tremors
172,killbill_28,Excellent!,10,28 July 2006,"Tremors is one of the best monster movies of the 1990's. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are the two main stars trying to stop these gigantic worms called ""graboids"" from eating and destroying their town of ""Perfection"". It co-stars Michael Gross, Reba McEntire, Finn Carter and Ariana Richards, this cast one of the best you have ever seen in a movie like this. First time director Ron Underwood directed this movie and still is today his best! S.S Wilson and Brent Maddock wrote the story and they also produced it. The special effects of this movie were done by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr and are one the best seen in a monster movie, the worms look so real and their attacks on people are so terrified that it sends chills up your spine. The movie has gore, but only in small amounts (like brains and stuff like that). This movie spawned 3 squeals which are B graded but they are still very good and well made.",Tremors

They should have made more movies together. Its not scary as it should be, i think its actually more fun than scary. Many jokes are at the right place, the setting in place would not work this good if it was set anywhere else. Its been a long time since I've seen the rest of the movies but in my opinion this one is by far the best concerning the character development, their chemistry, the fun and the rest.",Tremors

176,rorymacveigh-66661,My idea of a film!,9,29 March 2015,"When I was a kid, this used to terrify me, largely because of the fact that it's done so well. Sadly I didn't see the humour, but more seeing people being horribly killed, but that's thanks to the fact that the design of the mighty monsters is so well done and look so realistic that you could actually believe such things exist!So what's the Linguine? Two handymen named Val and Earl live in the remote desert town (if you can call it that) of Perfection, situated in a vast valley surrounded by mountains. Unhappy with their mundane, meagre way of life they decide to head out to Las Vegas in order to raise their fortunes. Sadly, their emigration from the Valley is halted by a series of brutal murders and the destruction of the only road out. Attempting to cross the valley by horse, the murderer is found to be instead a group of gigantic underground worms that sense their prey through vibrations in the earth. With the town now their next target, Val and Earl must draw a line in the sand (pun intended) to stop these subterranean meanies before they gobble the whole town out from under them!The best thing about this movie is the fact that it's a solid story with a gripping first half and an even more gripping second half. The first half builds up the worms, not showing them until our heroes stumble across them. After this it's a desperate battle to fight off the horrific creatures in a life and death confrontation. As mentioned, the design of the monsters is very good, and will have you believing that such things do actually exist, which is what scared me most as a kid, and the way that they operate through vibrations and sound rather than through sight or smell is very clever.The humour is also very good, with a selection of physical and verbal humour adding a light hearted human touch to the dark situation they find themselves in.Overall, as an adult I love this movie because it really is that perfect blend of story, horror and humour. A solid plot, some great animatronics for the worms, genuine funny characters with good strong development and humour, mixed together to create a fine homage to the B-Movies of the 1950's such as Them! and the Creature from the Black Lagoon.",Tremors
177,wmjahn,"The BEST B-movie in the 1985 to 1995 period, if not even longer !",10,31 August 2007,"""Tremors is a flawless film"" wrote another commentator on this site and he's damn right ! What a movie ! I've missed it in the cinema, because over here in Europe, this maybe played in Vienna in 2 theaters for one week and hardly anybody catched it. But some time later, maybe 1992, 1993 it was shown on TV, some midnight cheapie, I thought, but watching it, it scored bullseye, I was glued to the TV-set.Have seen it 3 or 4 times since then and it's an amazing joy to see this again and again and again and ...Why ? First the storyline is simply simple & fantastic & brilliant. The perfect homage to the B-movies (you know, Tarantula et. al.) of the 50ies and 60ies. Even better than they were/are.Ron Underwood must have seen maybe all these B-flicks, at least most of them, and captured the essential elements of this genre perfectly. There is NOT ONE WRONG SCENE in this, it works, from start to finish, like THE master-thesis for the ""giant creatures are trying to kill us""- :-)) genre. If Tarantino would have made this, he would be hailed to the hall of fame for it (where he is anyway, but then again, isn't this one mucho better than Death Proof, e.g.?).The dialog is extremely casual/leisured/funny, always on the spot. Cleverly photographed, funnily written, without being stupid for just a second.What makes this so very special is the relationship between these two slackers, Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. One younger, one slightly older, the chemistry between them is fantastic, the really seem to have spent all their lives together in the backyards of rural America. Their looks, the dialog, their mimic, all unmatched in the last 20, 25 years of US-cinema.TREMORS was Ron Underwood's first feature and none of his later efforts does come even close to it (actually he made just unmemorable schlock later). But this one picture will get him recognition far beyond his earth-days, I bet ! TREMORS poures love & total respect for the genre from every frame ! I bet Ron Underwood, who was 37 when he directed this masterpiece, must have dreamed of making this movie for a decade or even longer, that's why it is so superbly developed, so perfect, so flawless.Watch it, love it, watch it again, I bet you will ! :-))",Tremors

Even Kevin Bacon, who was worried his career was over while filming this movie, plays the part of a dumb desert hick terribly, running around the whole movie like a fool with a bad accent.It's just bad all around.

Bacon also has a great co-star in Bassett and it's obvious they play off of one another because in the sequel Bassett isn't as effective without Bacon. Another great addition to the film is McEntire who many country fans know and love.The movie is funny, has a little bit of blood, and some decent suspense although it's not scary/serious.

It is also a buddy film, a comedy, & a hell of a good time! ""Tremors"" is filled with great special effects that still hold up well today. It's giant carnivorous worms are original to say the least, but these worms eat the fisherman, as they attack anything making vibrations on the ground, like Great White sand sharks! This makes for some very good suspenseful moments! ""Val"" (Kevin Bacon) & ""Earl"" ( the very underrated Fred Ward) make for the buddy part of the film, & have great chemistry playing off one another, with funny lines, bickering, & superior acting, you'd think these two had been friends for years. They really make this movie work, along with a great cast of character actors, playing misfits, in a misfit desert village (I don't think it quite qualifies as a town) , way off the asphalt path. Especially good are Michael Gross & Rebecca McEntire, as a married couple that are survivalists, armed to the ears waiting to wage war, but not the kind they think.All in all, ""Tremors"" is a classic up date of giant mutated monster movies of the 50's. It's funny flowing script, it's superior acting, editing, direction, & lastly, it's great special effects will make any monster movie lover happy! Just don't feed the worms.",Tremors

183,roland-sinn,Very Well Made Formulaic Horror,8,19 August 2003,"Tremors is a film which mixes equal amounts of horror and comedy. Although the story is pretty standard fare, the production more than makes up for any plot predictability. Of course, as Tremors does follow formula, there is a level of predictability. As an example, the fates of certain characters are obvious from the moment these characters are introduced to the screen.
But what makes Tremors refreshing is it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it makes certain not to resort to cheap shocks or gratuitous violence. It sets out to provide light fun and delivers solidly.Both script and direction are extremely good. The characters are warm, quirky and well drawn. I found it easy to feel a level of sympathy for them  even the gun totting survivalists.As true to most genres, there's a love interest sub plot. I'm not particularly fond of romance in films, but Tremors handles these scenes between two of the lead characters with a healthy dose of humour and a dash of perceptive poignancy. Overall, an excellent example of the horror genre. Tremors 2 is also equally enjoyable.8/10",Tremors

The beasts are also perfect. They learn how to hunt humans better and better, and we begin to wonder if they're not smarter than we are.

191,KEITH-LANCASTER,The descriptive words ludicrous and ridiculous can be inadequate.,1,29 March 2002,"This movie belongs in the extreme realms of absolute fantasy.  I findit hard to believe that there are viewers who regard this as possibly the greatest sci/fi. movie of all time.   A giant worm (one of the most basic forms of life ) has the mental capacity to plan a strategycapable of outwitting the residents of a small town ( TOWN?!) which consisted of maybe a dozen rickety old buildings.   Bearing in mind this is a sun baked desert (let us not confuse the desert with thebeach where the sand is soft) and only the very top layer is of amanageable texture.  Now we have a creature capable of propelling its soft body through the ground at speeds which I estimated to be way is excess of any man made device.   It sucks a two ton station wagon down into the depths ( the headlights were still on hours later, somebattery I must get one ) and wraps a tentacle around the axle of a large pickup almost preventing it from moving.   The acting was poor as was demonstrated in the casual approach to the most precarious situations. I am well aware that a degree of make believe is necessary in order to provide acceptable entertainment, that is what sci/fi. is all about. This film strains any concept of logic to a level which I find completely unacceptable.  The Alien series and both versions of The Thing are way better and I could list numerous other horror andsci/fi. movies superior to Tremors.  I will not be wasting my timewith the sequels.",Tremors
192,Joshua_Penczek,A masterpiece made out of something stupid.,10,9 August 2016,"Tremors should be a stupid movie. In Tremors, two wisecracking sidekick co-worker/friends are fed up with their hobunken redneck Nevada town and dream of heading to the big city, only to come across a herd of giant underground worms that are hungry for human flesh while moving out. The story is something an 8th grader would come up with, but two very talented writers adapted the story into a magnificent screenplay, and it was later adapted by a smart director and his brilliant crew.First of all, the dialogue between characters is realistic, catchy, and witty. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward talk like real humans with lines that flow smoothly. Most of the characters are like this, but these two in particular share some brilliant chemistry. Second of all, the tension is flawless. While I do think some trimming could be done in order to keep the reveal of the monsters more shocking, what we have is still excellent and much better than most in its genre. The audience at any point never suspects that the mysterious events occurring around town could be because of a giant monster. Third, the pacing is magnificent. Only at around 90-minutes, the 1at, 2nd, and 3rd act are all very distinguishable and flow together very well. The two writers behind his screenplay are S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock, and they deserve much more credit that what they get.Ron Underwood finely directs this film, taking obvious inspirations from John Carpenter and Sam Raimi along the way. There are several gorgeous wide shots of the deserts, something you'd print off and hang up on your wall. The sound design is also fantastic: the monsters locate prey by keying in on sounds or vibration. The movie is mostly silent except for loud bursts noise, and most edits cut from silence to loudness. It's genius attention to detail like this that make Tremors such an enjoyable experience.I'll never understand why this film doesn't get more love, even among 80's/90's nostalgia fanboys and monster movie lovers. You'll see entire tributes dedicated to mediocrity like Ghostbusters or Burton's Batman, but you'll be lucky to even see sentence written about Tremors.

197,north-julie,hilarious,8,23 April 2006,"When giant burrowing mutant worms attack a small town, its up to Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward to save the day. Now, with the plot out of the way, we can move on....Yes thats right. This is a classic example of a B-Movie, with a limited use of plot and a good old fashioned use of great characters and humour used to fill in the blanks.As Val, Kevin Bacon displays his leading man credentials in a role that is born for him. He will never be an action man in the mould of Bruce Willis, running down a street in a vest waving guns around. Here he has a role perfectly drawn out for him, as a small town hero who has limited common sense and intelligence, but a heart of gold. Fred Ward, brilliant as an unhinged soldier in southern Comfort, is great as Bacon's slightly older (well, a lot older actually) best friend who has a calmer more restrained view of life than his usually overexcited friend. Finn Carter provides a pretty face as an improbably pretty meteorologist, and grabs some of the best lines of the movie (while also stripping down to her undies) Michael Gross, with his personalised numberplate that reads UZI 4 U is a hoot, with his giant arsenal of weapons in his underground bunker. The fact that it can supposedly survive a nuclear blast but not a burrowing worm is overlooked because he is great support along with his slightly unhinged wife. They shoot one of the 'mother humpers' to death when it dares to break into their bunker, with Gross having to resort to his hilariously over-sized elephant gun to get the job done.These larger than life characters are what gives Tremors its charm. The film never takes itself too seriously, and is a lot better than many serious creature features (for instance Godzilla). It has great comedy (the group pole vaulting away from the worms) and great liners such as the followingKevin Bacon (talking about the worms)- What do you think they are doing? Finn Carter (looking exasperated as she keeps being asked questions about the worms)- Why do you keep asking me? The great script, imaginative effects (the worms are blind, so they hunt by listening to vibrations from above and then sending out little tentacles affectionately known as 'graboids') and good performances from the central cast give this loving B-Movie a great shine.If you like cheesy slightly cheap comedy horror movies than this is for you!",Tremors
198,aaronlbacks,ALASKAN BULL WORM,7,26 December 2017,"I think there's a SpongeBob episode that is inspired by this movie. And it happens to be very good source material for a kid's show. This campy, b-rated horror film about a group of Nowhereville residents, led by two country-boy handymen, Valentine McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Basset (Fred Ward), fighting off four mutant underground worm-monsters is a blast and is sure to put a smile on your face. While the premise sounds like a cheese-fest (and the script is full of cheesy lines and jokes which don't always land), this is a genuinely clever movie. Our townspeople always appear to be backed into the tightest corner of the room, but the ingenuity of these people who lack school smarts was making me question if I had the brains or the balls to figure out or attempt what they did to save their butts. It's not the typical horror movie where you can tell the next couple steps 30 minutes before they happen; the smart writing has always got you guessing at the edge of your seat as to what is going to occur next. While most characters don't really have some sort of arc, care was put in to give each individual their own style and personality and that was used to help further the story in a smart way as well. And while the storyline shines brightly, I feel that some of the dialogue falls flat on its face. Some of the jokes don't quite make it (that may be a result of some bad acting?), and sometimes I question whether someone would say what some of the characters said in given scenarios. But these groaners would be even more detrimental if the film took itself too seriously. Thankfully it doesn't, as noted by a lot of the unrealistic, but very fun special effects. Tremors would be a good movie to watch in a group of friends because everyone is sure to have a good time.",Tremors
199,tbuchalski,"Tremors: My Good, Bad, and Ugly",6,10 June 2019,"The Good:
The monster movie is brought out of the darkness and into the light. Tremors injects some comedy into a familiar genre while still keeping the mystery and suspense of survival and escape going from start to finish. As the story unfolds it engages the audience with a pair or unlikely heroes in Earl and Valentine, partially inept ""handy men"" scraping by for something bigger. They get their wish in an undesirable way when the small town of Perfection, Nevada turns to them to outwit a prehistoric zoological nightmare that hunts based on sound. With heroes poorly suited to lead a town or save their own lives everyone's survival is suspect, and their dim-witted comic relief effectively makes light of their dire circumstance.The Bad:
With little to work with narratively the performances don't do much to elevate the simple story. Even with the lighter tone of the film and the necessity of the comedy to establish that tone the two-dimensional principals fail in delivering believable portrayals or mastering comedic timing. Still though, even as it misses the mark in its attempts to deliver well-crafted or complex characters, they are easy to identify with. Even though there isn't an incredibly deep story it is exciting until the end. And finally, while the attempt at offering a comedic sensibility to lighten the mood is comical in itself there is enough there to make this film more an adventure of survival than typical horror, or monster, fare.The Ugly:
Films with mysterious monsters of the natural world peak our interest because they reveal to us something that is normally hidden from us. Tremors invents a prehistoric creature to capture interest, but perhaps that is at the root of its failings. The audience knows that the monsters at this film's center aren't real, so their willful suspension of disbelief is harder to attain. In that, Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975) captivates its audience because the threat is of the real world. In part based on a series of attacks in the early 20th century this film reminds the audience that the subject of the film is all too real. To paraphrase a tag line from the film, it's not safe to go out into the water.",Tremors

I was going to see another movie (for ages 18+) , but I was too young then. I´ve never been as happy to be ""too young"" as then: it turned out this movie was far superior to the one I intended to see. Tremors is an excellent combination of horror, adventure and comedy. It starts as a lightweight comedy acted out by Bacon  and Ward (both are superb as anti-heroes). Then it turns towards horror and adventure never forgetting to keep the tongue  glued firmly to cheek. The threat to these buddies (and to the rest population of a very small town) comes from killer worms that attack from underground. The basic idea of not being able to touch the ground in fear of the worms comes (obviously?) from our childhood games. Haven´t we all played the game where you´re not supposed to touch the ground?

At every turn, their attempt to leave gets foiled by one thing or another and some of it is due to the monsters.The other thing that I told my friends to look for is the tightly scripted plot. There is not a wasted motion by the characters or pointless plot element. This makes the movie watchable, over and over again.The next thing great about this movie is that it is full of stereo-types. In old movies, the dog, the Indian, the Chinaman or the Mexican get killed. It is not surprising that in the entire series of four movies, all of these stereotype victims end up getting eaten. You will have to watch this movie to find out who gets eaten. The Bert Gummer character is a joy to watch and the stereo-type survivalist character is done to ""perfection."" The last great thing about this movie is the great, witty and snappy dialog. I can only hope that someday this film will earn great cult status and the audience will recite the lines, like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" I love this movie and I recommend it highly. You just have to lighten up on your expectations and it will become fun!",Tremors
203,jameslipski,One of those addicting movies,8,12 February 2011,This movie is creative. I have seen it numerous times when channel surfing and stopped to watch. I don't know why but it grows on me and I am very entertained. It has the right mix of horror and comedy.Plus since I live in Nevada I can relate to the feeling of isolation in the wide open countryside shown in the film. The towns people have the trapped feeling when the roads are blocked by the creatures and that is exactly the way it is here in Nevada.The characters are fun to watch as some panic and others want to make money off of the discovery. Truly a low budget winner.,Tremors

It is like a rough and tough cowboy movie, male bonding and that kind of stuff.  It is never really scary but is a good comedy if nothing else.

This movie has its own original idea and molded it together great. The acting is excellent with very convincing attitude. This is an excellent buddy movie with a lot of humor in it, which I cannot help but laugh every time they get into a sarcastic speal. The supporting cast was excellent and very believable. The special effects were top notch with no CGI used. These creatures were all practical using full scale puppets or miniatures. We can thank the good special effects wizards that did this movie including Dennis Stotak, Alec Gillis, and Tom Woodruff Jr, who all have an impressive resume. There is one blue screen shot used and still everything was real just used to a backdrop in a scene. The dialog was great and it was sold excellent by the actors. The movie ends with no need for a sequel, however three more become created. It's its own story, and characters with no cliché's tying to any other characters out there (for the time). The timing and direction was great. It did create good suspense and terror at times which didn't take away from its humor. It is a great movie which should have more love than it has. This is a movie you can watch time and again because it is good entertainment and has a touch of many genre's for viewing pleasure. I give this a 10 out of 10 because it still has stood time for me as a great movie with few flaws and much much entertainment value. A must own in my opinion.",Tremors

210,hmcusn294,Giant Worms Eat Perfection,10,8 November 2008,"I have watched this DVD at least 20 times and still enjoy it as much as I did the first time I saw it. ""Val and Earl,"" played by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, are handymen living in the town of ""Perfection,"" a small isolated desert town with a population of 14, who with the help of ""Rhonda LeBeck,"" a graduate student seismologist played by the devastatingly cute Finn Carter, discover four huge underground worm like creatures that are intent on devouring every living being in the valley of Perfection.Michael Gross and Reba McEntire are good as ""Burt and Heather Gummer,"" a survivalist couple who chose to live in the valley because of it's isolation and have dozens of guns with ammunition, food for five years, air and water filtration systems, 1000 gallons of gasoline, Geiger counters and a bomb shelter, ironically to be driven out by underground creatures from which they had no protection.I am confused by the presence of Melvin Plug, a teen age boy, played by Robert Jayne, who apparently lives in Perfection on his own, without benefit of family or home. Charlotte Stewart and Ariana Richards play look alike mother and daughter Nancy and Mindy Stemgood. In the scene where Val tackles Mindy from her pogo stick to save her from one of the ""Graboids"" I notice that Mindy's part is played by a stunt double. I had never thought of there being child stunt doubles. We live and learn.All in all this is an entertaining ""horror"" movie that would be wonderful for all ages if they had not included an excessive amount of bad language. Most of it seems gratuitous and not necessary for the story. However, it is still a very entertaining movie that is fun to watch. I give it a full ""10.""",Tremors

Thankfully, there's no overdone CGI and the worms are actually well-rendered and convincing. But I must say, I was a little misled, seeing how it is the worms don't actually look like the one on the video box cover (which actually looks cooler). But never mind that, I'm wondering how the director managed to pull off so many scenes of the creatures popping out from underground. I mean, given the fact that this is a goofy monster movie, it couldn't have been given a very big budget. I also love those worm POV shots, particularly the ones that actually feature the camera wading through the dirt.",Tremors

A small isolated town is besieged by giant underground worm like creatures. It doesn't matter where they came from. Sometimes you just never know the answers. That's how it is in life. Anyway, the best part of it is the dialogue. The exchanges are witty and funny. I laugh a whole lot while watching this movie. The characters are great and the way they interact is so damned enjoyable. There's not just humor though. There's tons of action and thrills without a lot of gore. It's an exciting and totally enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this movie. You'll be glad you watched it.",Tremors

It has everything! It is funny - mainly due to the characters - has a lot of action and excitement, and is also still a classic monster-movie.The actors are amazing and portrait their roles, I would say, perfectly. The special-effects feel very realistic and constitute a natural part of the movie unlike some other movies that are focused almost entirely around special-effects. The plot is actually rather straight-forward which in this case works out really well since the movie evolves highly around the characters and the location - a desolate, isolated valley in the outbacks of Nevada and the people living there.The strength of this movie is really that is has everything, that all the components of a good movie comes together to make this one of the best ever. It's not ""spectacular"" in any way, it's just exceptionally well made and balanced in every aspect. Just go and see it... VERY highly recommended!",Tremors
214,briandmcaleer,That ground you walk on is not so safe...,7,23 October 2013,"The big surprise about ""Tremors"" is actually how good it is. Despite the plot, which sounds simple and quite ridiculous, it's a very entertaining little film. The cast were picked to perfection, led by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. Joining them is Michael Gross; the dad from ""Family Ties"" who plays a gun-happy enthusiast, along with his wife, who aides the towns fight for their lives with his massive collection of weapons and explosives. There's also a young female Seismologist, who was originally drawn to the town of Perfection to investigate the course of all the earth tremors that had been recorded in the area. Then there are a few other assorted characters that either get eaten or scream and run away from the monsters.The premise of the monsters coming from underground is a clever one. When you stop and think about it, we humans are limited to the ground we walk on by that thing called Gravity, you follow? So when our right to walk along the surface of the earth safely gets taken a way, we climb a tree, get on top of our car or high-tail it to the roof. The characters in Tremors do this to avoid getting gobbled up, but these underground beasts are cleverer than they look, and find ways to bring down buildings and force their prey back onto the ground. The various ways in which the characters stay off the ground and play to the monsters sense of movement and vibration is clever and crafty. At one point, they make a lot of noise and stamp their feet on the ground to draw the attention of the monsters, allowing their friends to run away. Or my favorite was when they turned on a small mower, let it drive off on its own and watch, as the monster instinctively follows it, allowing one of them to make a run for it. Tremors was not a hit in it's time, but went onto to garner a massive cult following over the years. It gave way to three sequels, which all went straight to DVD, but are worth a watch. Over the following films, the monsters changed and evolved, but the characters we met and fell in love with from the original film remain the same, and this is probably the biggest attraction of the ""Tremors"" series.",Tremors

Not only is it extremely funny it's exciting, intriguing and even a little scary at times. The concept is great, the setting totally inspired and the characters spot-on. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a totally convincing pair of bumbling handymen, wanting to leave the sad little town of Perfection and make their fortune in the big city. The problem is that just as they pluck up the courage to go, giant worms (Graboids) move in to claim their stake and their place on the food chain.

216,janicebowman,One of the best B movies of all time,8,11 September 2018,"Tremors is a very well executed, well-made B movie.

Fed up when we meet them, they decide to head out for better opportunities when they come across a dead body. This leads to the discovery of another body and the revelation of the presence of an underground snakelike creature (called graboids) that is the cause of all this chaos- and there are a few of them. What ensues is a war between the tiny populace of this insignificant, socially isolated town and the terrorizing slithers. Tremors does not take itself seriously, provides ample amount of entertainment because of great, relatable characters and the endearing leading pair of Bacon and Ward. Pacing is excellent, and the special effects are so good it makes me wonder why real puppetry and models are not used to the scale it used to be- CGI has overstayed its welcome and films like Tremors prove live action work has not.

221,ghenrikson-1,Possibly the Perfect Monster Movie,9,2 February 2003,"""Tremors"" is a modern homage to and satire of the B-grade monster movies of the '50's and '60's.  It finds a perfect balance between making fun of the monster movie and actually making a monster movie.  Thus, the stock character of scientist-in-lab-coat-who-explains-everything is transformed into Finn Carter's graduate student who can't explain anything.  Bacon and Ward fill the lead roles of Val and Earl.  They argue with each other like an old couple.  The invasion of giant worms literally blocks their way out of Perfection.  At the same time, though, it transforms them from low-end ranch hands to cowboys, riding off to save the town.  I am particularly fond of Michael Gross and Reba McEntire as the survivalist couple, Burt and Heather.  Burt is prepared for anything--except giant underground worms.  His basement also reminds me of my own.  ""Tremors"" should get an award for being the only film ever to feature a brass tumbler as a major prop!  It also features a .600 Nitro Express elephant gun in all its glory.  Somebody behind this film knew something about firearms.
""Tremors"" could easly have become too mocking of itself and the genre, like ""Evolution.""  But in the end it's much easier to make fun of the old B movies than to actually make one yourself.",Tremors

226,iollann,'Tremors' Review,7,30 March 2017,"Review: 'Tremors' Directed by Ron Underwood, 'Tremors' starring Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and Finn Carter is a fun, sci-fi, horror/comedy film set in a rural, isolated town in America where residents have to defend themselves against strange, underground creatures. Released in 1990 it is known as a cult classic. 'Val' played by Kevin Bacon and 'Earl' portrayed by Fred Ward are two handymen who make a living off doing odd jobs in Perfection, Nevada a small, isolated settlement in the desert near the Sierra Nevada mountains. People begin to be picked off one by one by underground creatures. The film works well because it doesn't take itself seriously, has a simple story line that's easy to follow and it opts for laughs rather than scares. The most laughs come from the chemistry between best friends Earl and Val. Their acting made their chemistry so natural. The camaraderie between them is hilarious. The action in this film is exciting and frantic. The last half of the film is full of exciting moments and thrills. In so many of these types of films the characters seem to react very stupidly to situations but in this film the characters seem to actually react intelligently, the same goes for the creatures. As I said, the last half of the film is an intense thrill ride without a dull moment. The first half of the film is the build-up and it works pretty well, establishing the characters, relationships and the setting. This film shares lot of similarities with Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws'. Both films use similar techniques to build suspense, hiding the creatures from sight for a good portion of each film. Also they show the creature's point of view with some nice camera shots like in 'Tremors' it's almost like the camera is rushing through the dirt in the ground. Another reason I enjoy this film is because it isn't heavy on the CGI. I really dislike when films use CGI more than they should especially older films when the technology holds up. The fact that the effects still hold up today just goes to show it. The film isn't too gory either apart from a couple of moments, this works especially well with the light hearted atmosphere the film has. In conclusion 'Tremors' is an entertaining, fun film. Now it's not flawless, it's no 'Shawshank Redemption' it has a straight forward story with very little character development but that doesn't really matter too much in the end. The main reason it works is the chemistry between characters and the fact it doesn't take itself too seriously. I give it a 7/10 and I think it would be suitable for almost all ages to be honest.",Tremors

They're bad-ass type and tough-as-nails personalities were extraordinary and as you watch them throughout the film, the more you enjoy this flick. The other casts did a fine job as well. You were kind of rooting for them to survive and not to be eaten by graboids. The graboids looks kinda' cheesy yet scary. The point of view of the graboids using the point of view of a single camera looks even more scarier as it hunts down for its next victim.This movie makes me laugh, makes me terrified, makes me want to bite my fingernails and even makes me want to be careful when I'm standing on the ground and trying not to make a sound.

236,jbraun1984,"or, 'The Misadventures of Val and Earl.'",10,15 May 2007,"I have been watching this movie a few of times a year for over 15 years now (I watched it again last nightthat's what has sparked me into writing this now). You may have noticed that I gave it a '10' rating. This high rating is in part due to the over 15 years of longevity I have been able to cull from this filmall without tiring of it. Had I rated this film after having just seen it for the first time, I would most likely have given it a 7 or 8still pretty high for what it is (pure FUN!). What can I sayit's grown on me.The castperfect. Normally, had I seen the cast list with the top five stars recorded as Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Reba McEntire, Michael Gross, and Finn Carter I would have been somewhat skeptical, however this is not the case. Taken separately, I have liked them all before and after Tremors: Kevin Bacon (Valentine 'Val' McKee)  ""Quicksilver"", ""A few Good Men"", and ""Apollo 13"" (and many more). Fred Ward (Earl Bassett)  ""The Right Stuff"", ""Remo Williams"" and ""The Player."" Reba McEntire (Heather Gummer) I have respected as a musician for quite some time, although I'm not a big country fan. As it turns out, she is also quite adept as a comic actress, as we saw for the first time in ""Tremors,"" as well as on her own TV sitcom, ""Reba."" Michael Gross (Burt Gummer), of course, was one of our 'favorite TV dads' during the 80s while staring as Michael J. Fox's father Steven Keaton in ""Family Ties."" I also believe that Gross is the only one of the original cast of ""Tremors"" to star in all three of the subsequent sequels as well as ""Tremors, the Series."" As for Finn Carter (Rhonda LeBeck), I didn't really know who she was before ""Tremors,"" however I have recognized her a number of times since - mainly on television.The picture, set it the fictional town of Perfection (see the 'complete' description of Perfection on Wikipediawho knew?), lying in the middle of the Perfection valley (a desert) in Nevada and bounded on three sides by mountains is a perfect (no pun intended) spot for this kind of horror fun. It's sort of a haunted house without the house. The residents of the area (those that are left anyway) have been trapped 'inside' due to a rock-slide that closed the only way out of the valley.And then you have the monsters who are trying to reign terror on the trapped few left in town. Why they started the attacks is never really addressedbut who cares, because the terrible fun is just beginning. The monsters (Earl thinks could be aliens  duh) are essentially big worms (a la ""Dune""  1984) that can out run a human or a horseunderground! They are big, smelly and disgusting (but in a good way) and apparently quite smartat least for a worm. However, just as sound is their primary means of sense (no eyes and underground and all), it is also their bane as loud noises will cause them to runfor a short while anyway. Without giving too much away, let's just say that noise turns out to be their final downfall (again, no pun if you have seen the film).Much of the fun with this film comes from the verbal potshots that nearly everyone takes at each other. Val and Earl are working buddies and very brother-like and are therefore compelled to rib one another at the other's expensealthough they are always there for each other too. The opening of the film sets the mood for the rest of what followstake my word for it or watch it yourself.Burt and Heather Gummer (married, without children) are survivalists that have chosen the isolation of the Perfection area as their personal 'Eden."" Burt is by far the more zealous of the two and does not have the greatest sense of humor concerning his lifestyle choice, but in the end it's his obsession with weapons, and in this case home made ones (""Just a few household chemicals in the proper proportions."") that help save the day.Rhonda is the pretty and smart graduate student and the one with most of the common sense. She is also the 'straight man."" There are, however, some quite funny scenes with her delivering lines that normally would have been something that only Val or Earl would have said. Very out of character and very funny! The language is quite colorful and not short on words of the four letter varietytherefore, the 'R' rating. Otherwise, the movie would be fine fare for kids (there are many TV versions that obviously take care of the F-bombs, etcbut these are truthfully not nearly as much fun.). As a matter of fact, aside from a casual remark from Earl, directed to Val, basically telling him what part of his anatomy he thinks with, there is really not much sexual innuendo at allso, pretty safe stuff here.Oh yeah, I almost forgot about the 'gore' factor. Well, it is a horror/monster movie and so there is some. That being said, I will tell you that the blood and guts are mostly from the giant worms  aka 'graboids'  the enemy (bad guys in this flick) and are not really all that realistic. Messy, yesreal, no. Also, it's all being done in good humor and under the good guy/bad worm themeso (virtually) everyone will catch on. In the end, the good guys do win and the guy gets the girlwhat more could you want? (Free beer? Resist the temptation or you'll never get out of Perfection.)",Tremors

239,TacticalGear,A little gem.,9,28 December 1999,"Handymen Val and Earl and the small community of ""Perfection"" find themselves trapped, as smelly monsters from underground just will not give up in this witty and exciting adventure from director Ron Underwood.The genre is well-worn, yet Underwood manages to produce something original. The chemistry between Ward and Bacon is strong, and many laughs are had from their buddy-bickering. The husband-wife weapon fanatics are also very funny, and a glorious shoot-out between them and one of the ""graboids"" provides a welcome breath of fresh air.It is the score, however, that must take first prize, and it is about time one did. It accentuates the action and the wide open spaces beautifully. Most notable is the theme introduced as Val triumphantly taxies through the town on the CAT.A great movie!",Tremors
240,thomluka,Perfection,10,30 May 2002,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, as simple as that..The thing is.. it's far from a ""good"" movie, borrowing heavily from the cheap horror-movies of the 50's, but doing it tongue-in-cheek. (It's not as self-aware as ""Scream"", and actually not a parody as such, but in a sense, it's in a similar vein. Maybe closer to ""Galaxy Quest"" actually.) Whatever, they sure make it exactly right.It's simply supposed to be 90 mins of ""sit back and enjoy fun"", and it sure manages that real good.As the foundation, you've got a really great script with lots of witty and ""mean"" dialouge, and simply great moments, as findig that original up in a power-line mast, having starved to death rather than go down or finding a car buried in the sand (with the lights still on). The direction is perfect, as is most of Ron Underwood's movies, being able to switch between the good fun, and really turn on the ""scary"" parts when needed. It's fun all the time, but at the same time makes you sit on the edge of the seat at times.What makes the movie, tho, is the spirit. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon, along with all the rest of the actors, seems to have a really great time doing it and it shows on the screen.This is a movie that's.. well.. simply right, all the way..

Michael Gross, fresh off of his ex-hippie dad role in ""Family Ties"", and Reba McIntire's sweet country girl images are turned on their heads with their gun-loving, Doomsday prepping and bomb-making.

Tremors is what Jaws (1975) did for the ocean. The creatures (Graboids) look awesome and the machinery used to make them come alive looks so realistic that the first time i saw this movie i was scared s**tless of walking on the dirt.

Local handymen Valentine McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Basset (Fred Ward) discover that they've left it one day to late to leave Perfection Valley as strange, bewildering deaths ocurr. It turns out that giant,underground worms feel a little peckish and fancy a little munch on a remote desert valley.

247,csulpw,A fantastic monster film,8,18 January 2012,"Tremors is one of the best monster films to come out of the last several decades and it still holds up well today.The best part of this movie was by far the characters. It really nailed the sense of community and craziness that people have living in a small isolated town. Rachel, NV would be my pick for the closest real life example. (topography is similar too)Val and Earl are played by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward respectively. They play the handymen of Perfection and just as they try to get out of town to greener pastures, the area is attacked by ancient subterranean creatures they aptly name ""Graboids."" What follows is a smart and intense cat/mouse scenario where the town tries to get out of the valley and into the mountains(the Graboids can only travel in soft earth). The sense of isolation and the desolate setting really contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The characters are all likable and relatable. Unlike most movies of this genre, they think things through and try to make good decisions to get out of their predicament (like real people would).The standout scene features Burt (Michael Gross), and Heather (Reba McEntire) in their underground bunker. Burt and Heather are the survivalists if the community (there's always a couple), and the scene is intense and hilarious as they fight one head-on.The performances are all solid. Finn Carter (Rhonda) plays Val's love interest and she brings some beauty and brains into the proceedings. (refreshing!)The Graboids are done well. They are shown more through their presence underground than in full view which really adds to the suspense. I would go as far to say that Tremors is ""Jaws"" on land. The models they use are fairly realistic looking as well and the filmmakers and effect department did a great job bringing them to life.I highly recommend a viewing. Tremors is an easy to follow, fun, and smart monster film with a fantastic cast of actors.",Tremors

""Tremors"" is a cult classic. Kevin Bacon is good in this movie and so is Reba McEntire (I just love her music)as Heather Gummer. The Actor that pulls everything together is Michael Gross as your Gun Ho Burt Gummer. The special effect for the under ground monster is great. If you like Monster Movies, You will love this movie.

What weirdo came up with that? Well, the writer and director I guess. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon were really funny. I mean, perfect comedy double act or what! The cool, would-be ladies man and the, oh, how to describe him. Slightly gawky, but funny and a little bit cool, very occasionally. I didn't know a film could have so many one-liners and have all of them funny. I stand by my conviction that the film was so low budget that, when the last worm went over the cliff, they just threw a giant pink garbage bag full of tinned tomatoes and filmed it going SPLAT! Seriously. But a good film to watch if you fancy something that requires nothing but nil IQ, a good sense of humour and a bit of patience. Kevin Bacon was a classic hunk in his cowboy hat - but not as nice as in Footlose.",Tremors

The tremor effects in this film may be the best of the series and this film certainly is the most star studded of the pack, with very good character chemistry. Ward and bacon are not the only ones providing it though; Michael Gross and Reba McEntire also offer up some laughs. Most comedy or sci-fi fans will enjoy it, along with your average movie goer. So I highly recommend it. If you like Tremors, the other three films are: Tremors 2: Aftershocks, Tremors 3: Back to perfection, and Tremors 4: The legend begins.

I wonder how many 'takes' it had to have done until they could not stop laughing. If you are a cynical person, this movie is not for you. It's comedy in disguise, for those of us with that type of sense of humor. The special effects are above average for the budget of this movie ($11 million) and end product cheap at twice the price. Now the sequels...not so good. 'Tremors' was later lampooned in other movies, the ultimate compliment. If it is good enough to be remembered and not-so-subtly reminded you of it later, that's good.

The entire cast is great, especially Michael Gross who shines above everyone else as Burt Gummer(You can see why he was brought back for all 3 sequels). Granted the sequels suck(2 wasn't terrible but nowhere near as good as the first one, and the 4th one had some good moments.). I love the humor, action, and sci-fi elements mixed in, and of course the star of the movie is the Graboids, the huge worms that terrorize the humans in the film. Although I will admit the worms evolving in the later films is pretty cool but the characters of the last 2 just aren't as entertaining to watch on their own. Burt's character is good throughout every movie but he can't carry the films himself so when you lack good supporting characters it takes away from it greatly. Also it seemed the quality of the films actually went down as the films when along.",Tremors
253,ilker2307,Excellent,10,9 September 2005,"This movie caught me by surprise: I worked in a video store, and one day we got a preview tape of this movie, prior to its video release. I hadn't heard much about it, so I watched it, and was quite surprised at how enjoyable it was. Since then, I have seen the movie about ten more times (at least), and still get a kick out of it.Tremors is basically a landlocked variation on 'Jaws' and those 1950s giant bug movies: the isolated town of Perfection, Nevada (population 16), finds itself under siege by four monstrous, subterranean worm like creatures, that hunt by sensing vibrations in the ground. The plot revolves around the townspeople trying to outwit and escape the creatures (dubbed 'Graboids'), which are tearing the town out from under them.What really makes the movie work is the characters: all of them come across as real people trapped in an insane situation, and all have a lot of charisma, even though the film doesn't have tons of character development. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a hoot as a pair of low-rent handymen who become reluctant heroes. The byplay between the two is a lot of fun.Usually movies like this revolve around stupid people doing stupid things, just to raise the body count. Tremors is different: the characters react believably, and do smart things to try and escape and/or kill the Graboids. The creatures too are also fairly smart, and are not just mindless eating machines with no brains.Given its premise, Tremors is not a gory or violent film (although it has a couple of minor gross bits), and has a very good sense of humor. The film-makers are aware of their far-fetched premise (a couple of key questions go unanswered), but they treat it with respect and a certain amount of affection.",Tremors

Tremors does what a movie about ""giant underground worms that feed on the inhabitants of a small mid-western town"" seems like it could never do:  it lets its creativity charm you, making you smile, laugh, jump out of your seat, and root for perhaps the most satisfying ending in an action movie (a rarity in an industry that can never come up with something more creative than blowing up a monster).  Great acting all around, with a cast that seems like they're having a blast just being there, especially Kevin Bacon (as the hero cowboy) having the most fun of his career!  The worms themselves are equally impressive:  The bastard children of JAWS and the worms of DUNE.

Reba McEntire and Michael Gross are tops with their survivalist prepared to fight everything, but not something coming through the ground.

The unexpected monsters are a surprise to the cast and the audience. The cast not only tries to figure out survival but also why. The cast and the audience only know that monsters are eating people, ""We have got to get out."" If you can imagine being in a small town that out of no where is threatened by monsters of some kind, what would you believe and how would you except it. ""I vote for outer space. No way these are local boys."" If this sounds like you, your in for a treat. The cast constanly debates on the orgins, the plan, the escape, the mind set, and even what they should name the creatures. The comical way the cast deals with the confusion of unknown monsters is beautiful. An A+ B movie.*The best part is that they don't try to over explain by creating some lame back story for the monsters. The monsters are just there, except it and deal with it. Some of the characters can't move on without wondering where they came from while others could care less only concerned with how to escape.

When I was watching the Tremors with my family, I expected it to be this really wonderful movie where some worms come out to eat people. When I realized it was a horror, (more or less, not really a horror...at all) I was shocked. What I had visualized was a desert landscape, some slimy big caterpillar things coming out of the ground and trying to bite people, (I didn't know that they ate people, I really didn't,) and the peoplez standing on a *small* rock, avoiding the medium wormy things. I didn't think that those things would have teeth and be so horrible and vicious. So, when I first watched the movie, I admit I didn't appreciate it very much. But then I watched the second movie, and I realized how great the first one is. No offence toward the second third and fourth, but the first one has a feel that the others don't have. Also, I was really upset when Kevin Bacon didn't show up in the next ones XD. AND, when Heather broke up with Bert, I felt like murdering the director.

I know the setting is Perfection, Nevada, but this could be a small community in Texas, or Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, etc.I love the way a small band of neighbors, and an attractive outsider team up against a horrible threat to their existence. No one except for Finn Carter's character is a rocket scientist, but they are forced to become very resourceful, and tax their collective intelligence to the MAX to find a way to survive.The humor is great throughout the film as well.

The characters are really crazy fools but Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon do a really good job of playing into the circumstances and being just funny as can be.I think one of the elements that makes this movie work so well is that all the different characters come across as very real people all living their regular lives that just happen to be stuck in this two-bit town. They all are trying to deal with the situation as best they can and, well, stuff happens!There is a lot of action and a lot of gore, and there are a lot of killings.

But on the way, they encounter some underground beasties...The Direction: For first-time Film director Ron Underwood, it's remarkably well-shot. The film just oozes atmosphere and it feels both surreal and strangely life-like & believable at the same time. The special effects are excellent considering the year it came out (1990) when CGi effects were just toddlers.The performances: A career-defining performance for Kevin Bacon. Fred Ward is on top form as the tired, middle-aged Earl, and the supporting cast are brilliant.Everything else: The dialogue and on-screen interaction between Bacon and Ward is believable and well-played.

Of course if you are looking for amazing CGI effects Tremours is not for you but I can assure it makes up for what it lacks.

This movie also adds; Keep it stupid but not any stupider, and comes up with a brilliant movie plot. Perfect escapism on a 90 minute ride with Fred and Val in the dusty valley of Perfection.The plot is simple, an isolated town, simple people, two friends, monsters that burrow through the ground and no help.Character interactions are wonderful and one of the reasons i love this movie so much. Val and Fred have wonderful chemistry and work as town handy men, both entertain the idea of moving on to bigger and better things i.e, leaving Perfection. They do so too, or try to but in the words of Fred the Planner, "".....one damn day too late"".Then we have the Town storekeeper, who is obsessed with the idea of naming the monsters, ordinary town folks and the survivalist couple living in ""Geographical Isolation"". The movie is atmospheric and open vistas showcased in the movie enhance the sense of isolation and wonder. The tragedies which introduce the creatures to us are creatively concocted.The effects are wonderful considering they are not CGI and have a realism about them and look the better for it. I saw the effects (CGI) in the 3 other parts and they pale horribly in comparison.It is not a technical masterpiece but simply an enjoyable movie with some great laughs. If a movie can make one laugh and break the chain of real world for a while, its got to deserve a great score. The movie is a wonderful mix of horror, thriller and comedy and it should be viewed as such and enjoyed for its merits.Part 2 and 3 of this movie are alright and good for a few laughs. Part 4 which is a prequel is much better viewing with some nice characters introduced.",Tremors

276,lanlguy,Acting that isn't acting makes Tremors a classic,10,19 December 2005,"Don't you just love it when actors, directors, and producers take their work seriously but not themselves? I do, and that's what happens in Tremors, a well-acted, well-directed, well-produced gem that makes us glad that those involved allowed it to become a cold Coors six-pack of country boy capers. Much of the delight in watching Tremors derives from the rib poking guy fun that Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward have when working their scenes. And the fun starts early. In the second scene of the film, our erstwhile out-of-pocket handymen, Val (Bacon) and Earl (Ward), are constructing a barbed wire cattle fence. Kevin Bacon, an obvious non handyman, takes 10 strokes to hammer a nail into the fencepost. This apparently amuses Fred Ward, a true life handyman, who watches Kevin nearly botch the job. As Kevin walks away, Fred does an impromptu eye-ball inspection of the fencepost and then turns to give Kevin an ""I can't believe it"" look that surely made for some after-scene razzing over beers. If you're a late comer to Tremors, break out a couple of cold ones and watch it for more of the acting which isn't acting that makes this film so damned good and so much more than monster eats man. Thanks Kevin! Thanks Fred! Thanks Ron!",Tremors
277,evilpugproductions,So much fun,9,27 September 2017,"Had not seen this film in ages but caught it on TV. Great, great film. Kevin Bacon may distance himself from this flick but it is well worth multiple views. The tone is perfect throughout and even though some of the effects don't quite hold up you just don't mind as the well developed characters guide you through. Cannot wait to watch again,",Tremors
278,rudy-marmaro,a wonderful mixture of humor and horror,7,17 December 2005,"This movie is a wonderful tongue in cheek mixture of horror and humor. The two unlikely hero's, played by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward, have a real depth of character you don't often see in these type movies. You get a real sense of a small community with the interactions of the characters. Also, the scene of the monster breaking into Michael Gross' basement is classic.While some people may think this has a 'cheese factor' of 9, if you get the humor and the gist of the story, you can sit back and really enjoy some wonderful moments of horror spiced with humor.all four of these movies are worthy of adding to your collection, provided you have the requisite sense of humor. I do.",Tremors
279,barbwirenv,Great Flick --- A Classic of its Genre,9,28 February 2006,"I stumbled upon this film while channel hopping and saw what looked like Rural Nevada.I live in Nevada and loved the picture, even though the it is filmed in Inyo County, CA.I have seen the picture around 4 or 5 times and never get bored. The location is authentic and there ARE towns in rural Nevada (Coaldale (ghost town)and Rachel, for example)that do look like Perfection.Even though I live near Area 51 and the Tonopah Test range and have real scary things around me, I this picture kept me at the edge of my seat, even after several viewing.I grew up in the 1950's and this (film) reminds my of the Saturday afternoon flicks that we kids used to go to.",Tremors
280,Ali_Kazmi,Enjoyed it every time I saw it...,8,30 December 2001,"I saw Tremors, for the first time, back in the mid-nineties. At the time I was staying at my university dormitory and the movie was shown by a channel that used to do a repeat telecast of the day's movie after midnight. Believe me; the hostel TV room was again jam-packed when it was re-telecast around 1 after midnight. Since then, I have seen it nearly half a dozen more times and have enjoyed it every time. Wish I could say the same about the sequel(s).",Tremors

283,Chad-68,Good laughs with horror,8,28 July 2000,"Tremors may be horror, but you get your amount of laughs in the movie as well.  Val and Earl will humor you throughout even gruesome parts of the movie with witty remarks and the popular paper, rock, scissors decision-maker.  I'd recommend Tremors if you like comedy with a little suspense and horror.",Tremors
284,Kid Stellar,In the team photo of my all time favorite movies.,10,8 October 2000,"Lots of fun by Actors having fun too. Don't let the tag line fool you. I wish that other movies of the genre had characters this ""normal"" to present to us. It's a great ""what if"" kinda movie.Avoid the sequels though. You can't go home again.",Tremors
285,wheels91,Guilty pleasure delight,9,14 February 2002,"This movie is my top guilty pleasure movie.  Any time I flip by this movie, the remote is put down and I'm staying until the end.  The chemistry between Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward is excellent.  The movie blends a good amount of humor, action, and suspense and never takes itself seriously.  After his stint as an ultra-liberal on Family Ties, Michael Gross' turn as an extreme weapon-toting conservative is hilarious.  For just a fun 90 minutes, this movie is highly recommended.",Tremors
286,blenderbunny,Fantastic!!,10,11 March 2008,"If you are expecting well written script and amazing storyline please do not watch this movie. However, if you are open to a fun movie then go right ahead. This movie is full of laughs from start to finish. It's refreshing to find a movie that doesn't try to take it's self too seriously and provides pure entertainment. Valentine and Earl make a brilliant duo with a classic love-hate relationship. The manner in which they deal with the imminent creature threat is very tongue in cheek, making fun of more traditional creature sci-fi movies. -Valentine:""They're mutations caused by radiation. Or the government built them, big surprise for the Russians."" -Rhonda:""Well there's nothing like them in the fossil records, so they predate the fossil records which would make them a couple of billion years old. And we've just never seen one till now...Right"" -Earl:""I vote for outta space. No way these were local boys""Just an example of the way this movie takes the traditional monster movie clichés and turns them into jokes.I recommend this movie to anyone who can sit back and have a laugh without trying to look too deeply into plot because I can ensure you will enjoy it thoroughly.",Tremors
287,imlostloseyou,true classic of a movie,10,28 July 2009,"I remember having gone to see this movie when it first hit the theaters back in 1990. I recently stumbled on the DVD in the store and picked it up not really expecting to like it as much as I remember. After watching it again after all these years, I love it as much now as I did then.If you're looking for a good 'monster movie', Tremors is a good one. However, if you're looking to be scared, you'll be disappointed. It took a lot of creativity to pull off what they did in Tremors. They took a seemingly unrealistic situation (with the giant worms) and made it believable. The cast performed as if they were in a real life situation being chased by these big worms. You cheer along with them and feel their frustration. The special effects were pulled off almost flawlessly, making the movie just that much more believable.This movie might not be laugh out loud funny, but does have some good humor. Tremors might be a predictable movie, even rather cheesy at times. This is a far cry from modern 'horror' or 'monster' movies where they just seem to go overboard trying to 'be scary', but it's more along the lines of the prey outsmarting the predator. Tremors seems to pay tribute to classic '50s monster movies, having a certain nostalgia about it.",Tremors

291,oakheart,Litmus Test for Taste,10,4 February 2007,"This is a movie in the grand tradition of Hollywood 'B' films - a desperate trial for survival against an unknown - and yet, this is one of the better movies made. The actors are top drawer, the dialog is spot on, the cinematography excellent, the music and Foley work impeccable - this is a 'B' film with 'A' values. Especially appreciated is the treatment of the main female character, a contributing, non-screaming, clear-thinking individual, without sacrificing vulnerability and attractiveness. Little details are strewn throughout the movie, some of which foreshadow future events, others merely to enforce a sense of real-world existence for the characters. Lastly, the antagonist (per se) of the movie is an unusual creation in the field of monster/horror movies, well worth inclusion in the genre. This is a must-see movie, if only to use as a yardstick to examine any other movie of similar orientation.",Tremors

293,mathisto,It'll change your life,10,19 July 2019,"Classic flick, great cast and setting ... The kind of movie you start building up to from around about breakfast time. Forget the daily work routine, it's all about gearing yourself up for the nighttime session of the Val and Earl show. Pop corn, cooler by the couch, lights dimmed, surround sound set at about 98%. Buckle up ... A good mix of humour and terror, all set in the middle of nowhere ... God damn underground monsters!",Tremors
294,mitch_cfc,Excellent Film,8,1 July 2017,"This film isn't perfect but it does have some amazing aspects. It has the atmosphere of an old B movie classic with an 80s feel. The characters are unique and funny, while the story stays true to the horror genre. The special effects are cool and fun, they look good, and don't come across as try hard, overused CGI. Overall the movie has a similar feel to Jaws, despite the characters being stuck on land. It's worth watching for anyone into sci-fi, horror, comedies, or just having a laugh at a classic film.",Tremors
