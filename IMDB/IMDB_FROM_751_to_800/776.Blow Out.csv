0,bkoganbing,Just Out In The Woods Recording When..........................................,8,11 February 2009,"John Travolta is a sound engineer out in the woods during the dead of night trying to record some woods type noises for the latest film he's working on when he sees an accident in which a state governor is killed, a potential presidential candidate. He also records the distinct sound of a gunshot before the car went off a bridge and into a creek at night. Travolta also dives into the creek and rescues Nancy Allen, but is unable to save the male in the car. He finds out later about his VIP status.Director Brian DePalma obviously used a twist on the tragedy at Chappaquiddick as the basis for Blow Out. The title comes from the official police investigation where they say the car had a blowout which caused the accident, but Travolta insists on his version. And his sticking to the story is making a lot of people uncomfortable.Travolta does a nice job in a film role that a generation or two earlier James Stewart might have done, the average every man who gets heroic status thrust upon him. He's an ordinary man, but he wants the truth to come out.Look also for some good performances by Dennis Franz as a sleazy photographer and John Lithgow as a very thorough killer who really loves his job. He not only wants to hide his murder in a forest, he plants his own forest so to speak.Brian DePalma keeps the tension moving at all times in a manner worthy of Hitchcock. It was a good part for John Travolta, one of the last he would get acclaim for for some time.",Blow Out
1,Leofwine_draca,One of De Palma's finest,9,8 December 2015,"Another solid and stylish thriller from director Brian De Palma, who once again weaves his magic technically with lots of split screen effects, cool use of slow motion and excellent photography. This is a typically well-crafted movie, taut with plenty of suspense, twists and turns and one which keeps you guessing up until the finale as to the final outcome. All of the elements that made early Brian De Palma films successful are present, from the presence of regular performers Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz filling out roles to the flashy, overblown visuals and excellent command of action (check out Travolta's impromptu jeep chase across town, which wreaks havoc, for an example of the master at work). Although not as darkly horrific as De Palma's previous DRESSED TO KILL, BLOW OUT still contains a number of non-explicit but grisly murders that'll have you shifting in your chair, and the top-notch finale involves more woman-in-peril thrills to great effect.The leading role is taken by a young and handsome John Travolta, still riding high after the success of Saturday NIGHT FEVER. Travolta - although never one of my favourite actors, I have to admit - plays his part well and comes across as a dependable heroic character, with none of the overacting that plague more recent parts for the actor. Nancy Allen plays a rather grating ditzy female character who gets caught up in the action yet somehow manages to make herself likable rather than irritating whilst Dennis Franz has a small but fine part as a real slimeball. Kudos to John Lithgow for creating such a memorable character, one of the best in De Palma's filmography. BLOW OUT is a fine example of the thriller genre at its most successful and the unusual plot - in which sound effects are the key - works to its advantage, making it a movie to seek out and watch.",Blow Out
2,SnoopyStyle,great De Palma,8,26 October 2015,"Jack Terry (John Travolta) is a sound recording artist for B-movies. One night, he's out recording sounds when a car drives off the bridge. He dives into the creek and rescues Sally (Nancy Allen). It turns out that state governor McRyan was the driver. McRyan's man Lawrence Henry convinces Jack to cover up Sally's involvement. As he examines his recording, he discovers what sounds like a gunshot. Meanwhile Burke (John Lithgow) is trying to cover it all up. Manny Karp (Dennis Franz) filmed the incident and is selling the pictures.This is Brian De Palma with many of his visual touches. It's reminiscent of other great movies Blowup and The Conversation. Travolta is in his early hot streak. I wish Nancy Allen didn't do the girly voice and her character not be so slow. The story is full of paranoia and turns. I love the simplicity of Travolta working on his film. The whole movie has a great sense of impending doom.",Blow Out
3,mark.waltz,"Any film that mentions ""Sugar Babies"" gets a gold star from me!",7,10 March 2021,"After all, you really don't expect that in a John Travolta / Brian DePalma movie, especially as mentioned by Nancy Allen. this is a decent, sometimes slow moving psychological thriller, a film noir in the same year of ""Body Heat"" and the remake of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"".Travolta is really good as a sound editor for a cheap horror movie company in Philadelphia (not quite the horror film capital of the world), an expert on looping, so he's busy working on trying to fix a really laughable scream in the newest film which results in some very funny scenes.While out recording sound effects, he witnesses a car cleaning over a bridge, and rescues the girl inside, only to find that the man with her was the governor, a possible presidential candidate. Nancy Allen is the girl he rescues, a dingbat lady of the evening, and the governor's associates (one of them John McMartin) don't want that revealed.But Travolta's certain that there's a cover-up and suspects by discovering the sound of a gunshot that the tire on the car was blown out. He's determined to uncover this conspiracy which leads to him dealing with law enforcement, the scheming press and a murderous John Lithgow.While at first Allen got on my nerves, I came to actually care for her because she's a baby doll spirit in a grown woman's body, so her lack of acting ability worked for this part. There's still questions to be answered long after the film is over, and the twist in the finale is really macabre, but in certain ways, the film is also ahead of its time. The excellent photography which makes good use of Philadelphia location footage during the centennial of the Liberty Bell is a plus.",Blow Out
4,gavin6942,Incredibly Awesome,8,7 November 2013,"A movie sound recordist (John Travolta) accidentally records the evidence that proves that a car accident was actually murder and consequently finds himself in danger.First of all, I loved Travolta in this role and would have to rank it among his very best. Then, we find that Travolta lobbied De Palma to cast Nancy Allen for the role (as the three had previously worked together on ""Carrie""). Good call. Allen is incredible and really nails this role.On top of the obvious look at the making of movies from a darker angle, De Palma also revisits the theme of voyeurism, a recurring theme in much of his previous work (including ""Sisters"" and ""Dressed to Kill""). This works for him and is much appreciated.Travolta's obsessive reconstruction of a sound recording to uncover a possible murder recall both Michelangelo Antonioni's film ""Blowup"" and Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"". Obviously the former inspired this film (which even borrows the title), and the latter is very much along the same lines. Who does it better: De Palma or Coppola? Roger Ebert said the film ""is inhabited by a real cinematic intelligence. The audience isn't condescended to... We share the excitement of figuring out how things develop and unfold, when so often the movies only need us as passive witnesses."" Agreed, and well said. I never knew one minute to the next who was a good guy or bad guy and whether or not our heroes were safe... and that is a good film.",Blow Out
5,lee_eisenberg,several conspiracies rolled into one,6,18 February 2008,"By the time that ""Blow Out"" got released, there had been a number of movies dealing with suspicion of the government (""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""All the President's Men"", to name a few). I get the feeling that Brian DePalma was trying to capitalize on the genre - it's got pretty much the same plot as ""The Parallax View"" and ""Capricorn One"" - and the ending seemed a little bit as if they didn't quite know how to end it, so they gave it that ending.But still, the whole thing looks realistic. I don't doubt that the events portrayed could actually happen. Yes, it's true that John Travolta went thirteen years before starring in another good movie, but he nonetheless plays his role perfectly. Nancy Allen, John Lithgow and Dennis Franz also play their roles perfectly. Of course, I still say that DePalma's best movie ever is ""The Phantom of the Paradise"".",Blow Out
6,Woodyanders,"One of Brian Pe Palma's best, most gripping and underrated thrillers",9,20 May 2007,"Likable audio technician Jack Terri (splendidly played by John Travolta) does sound effects for cheesy low-grade slasher horror flicks. One fateful night while recording natural sounds on a bridge Jack records and witnesses a car crash which kills the state governor who was an aspiring presidential candidate. Jack also rescues and befriends the governor's rather dumb, but really sweet mistress Sally (a beautifully endearing performance by the adorable Nancy Allen). When Jack begins to investigate the circumstances behind the crash, he finds out that someone shot out one of the tires on the car and thus caused the accident to happen. Pretty soon both Jack and Sally are put in considerable danger. Directed with tight, stylish, assured aplomb by Brian De Palma, who also wrote the ingenious script which cleverly blends elements of ""Blow-Up"" and ""The Conversation"" into an absorbing and inspired synthesis, with exquisitely fluid, slick, sparkling cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond (the occasional use of split screen is especially tasty and impressive), plenty of nerve-wracking suspense, an intricate conspiracy thriller plot, a charming and touching love story between Jack and Sally, and a rousing, pulsating, elegant orchestral score by Pino Donaggio, this crackling ripper comes on like total gangbusters from start to finish. Travolta and Allen are outstanding in the leads; they receive terrific support from John Lithgow as vicious, coldly pragmatic assassin Burke and Dennis Franz as sleazeball blackmailer Manny Karp. From its bravura dead-on opening hilarious send-up of tacky slice'n'dice schlock to its exciting climax and bitterly ironic conclusion, ""Blow Out"" overall rates as an absolute powerhouse that comes highly recommended.",Blow Out
7,rmax304823,A Tragic Accident,5,27 October 2006,"Even if this film were more than moderately engaging, I believe I still wouldn't find it very satisfying. Who can help wincing at every ripped off scene? Aside from the generic influences of the women-in-jeopardy and slasher movies, there is of course the impact of Hitchcock. At some point an homage must be recognized for the rabid imitation that it is. The Hitchcock style is noticeable throughout -- lots of first-person points of view. And some scenes are lifted, not quite intact, from some of Hitchcock's set pieces. In ""Dial M For Murder"", Hitchcock has the would-be strangler stand silently behind the unsuspecting victim, the strangulating scarf stretched taut and held just behind her head, and there are a couple of false starts while the audience squirms and wants to shout a warning. Ditto. Only here the instrument is not a white scarf but a thin garrote and the murder attempt succeeds. It can at least be said, though, that the writer/director has extended his range -- shamelessly imitating not only Hitchcock but Antonioni's ""Blow Up."" The plot seems to go every which way. A governor is assassinated in the presence of a floozie. A hit man (John Lithgow) is cleaning up the loose ends by murdering everyone who might know anything about the set up. Those in the know include the floozie (Nancy Allen) and a sound man for a movie company (John Travolta) who just happened to be recording nature sounds in the park when the murder took place. Another guy (Dennis Franz) was also on the spot and photographed the ""accident"" while testing some new film in his movie camera. The incident takes place on a dreary wet night on a deserted street except that it seems to be the least deserted street in the world.Travolta pieces the bits of the puzzle together but finds they've been wiped out. The cops don't believe him. He enlists the aid of Allen, though there's nothing much she can do except provide another victim for Lithgow's evildoer.At the end, Travolta cradles her body while fireworks explode in the sky behind him and the tragic music of Donaggio pounds us into insensibility. He replays Allen's final scream again and again. It's as if he's lost the love of his life, whereas in fact the two hardly know one another. Travolta acts naturally and is passable. For some reason Nancy Allen is given a working-class New York accent, and she can't handle it. She comes across as Barbara Nichols but without as much talent.Who engineered the assassination of the governor and hired Lithgow? We never find out. It's symptomatic that we don't really notice the fact. Nor do we care much.",Blow Out
8,BA_Harrison,Designed to wow the senses.,8,27 February 2014,"While working late at night, movie sound recordist Jack Terry (John Travolta) records a car crash that claims the life of a future presidential candidate. After repeatedly playing back his tape, Jack is convinced that the crash was not an accident and slowly unravels an assassination conspiracy that puts his life in serious danger.Although Blow Out shamelessly half-inches it's basic premise from Antonioni's Blow Up (albeit with a bit of Hitchcock-style suspense chucked in for good measure), the sheer level of skill demonstrated by director Brian De Palma is more than enough to make up for any lack of originality in the plot. From the wonderfully orchestrated and very amusing film-within-a-film opening (which mercilessly mocks the slasher genre), to the tense finalé that takes place amidst a blaze of fireworks, Blow Out is a master-class in movie-making, a breath-taking, meticulously planned and flawlessly executed audio visual treat bristling with innovative camera-work, incredible editing and creative lighting.Star Travolta puts in a terrific central performance and is ably supported by the lovely Nancy Allen as Sally, the not-so-innocent girl he manages to save from the car, Dennis Franz as sleazeball-for-hire Manny Karp, and the sublimely creepy John Lithgow as Burke, the hired killer who enjoys his dastardly work just a little too much.",Blow Out
9,moonspinner55,"A stylish failure...handsome, but lumbering and ridiculous",4,18 May 2004,"Brian De Palma has fun at first, setting up a reel of what looks to be a T&A thriller, but there's a twist and it's very clever and catches the audience off-guard. John Travolta (in a solid, unflashy performance) plays a movie sound-effects man who captures on tape what appears to be a car crash from a tire blow out, but which is actually steeped in the kind of hyperbolic movie-thriller conspiracy which soon brings in Dennis Franz as a photographer, John Lithgow as a psychopath, and (worst of all) Nancy Allen as a hooker--they're all stock figures. Travolta works hard to create a character here, and the production is stylish, chilly and atmospheric, but the screenplay is rather sleazy and over-written. Once again, director De Palma plots a final twist for his viewers, shamelessly attempting to tie this heavy-handed plot together, but one can only scoff at his crass final 'gag.' Worse than a bad joke, it simply has no class. ** from ****",Blow Out
10,dbdumonteil,conspiracy theory,7,20 July 2007,"Amid a patchy filmography cluttered with works besmirched with extreme visual effects ""Carrie"" (1976), ""Scarface"" (1983), ""Body Double"" (1984), ""Blow Out"" effortlessly takes its place in the category of winners in Brian De Palma's work. It means that the filmmaker managed to refrain its penchant for the embarrassing features I mentioned and to produce a polished film.A film that bears its author's trademark. John Travolta acts a sound engineer, Jack Terry who accidentally recorded a car accident but further investigation reveals the evidence of a murder. Because he knows too much, he's in danger of his life and has to act all alone to be saved.The hero who has to manage all alone in a hostile world is a recurrent theme in De Palma's work and once again the filmmaker displays his technical master with brilliance with suspenseful moments of the right bottle in the bargain. If the influence of Sir Alfred Hitchcock is as glaring as in several of his previous movies, the filmmaker also found inspiration in Michelangelo Antonioni's celebrated ""Blow Up"" (1966) and in some famous conspiracy movies like Francis Ford Coppola's ""the Conversation"" (1974) or Alan J. Pakula's ""the Parallax View"" (1974). But all these influences are subdued and mixed with De Palma's thematic and technical obsessions to produce a genuine work.That said, ""Blow Out"" isn't as intense as the quoted works because it doesn't avoid the filmmaker's limits: true, bombastic gratuitous effects are virtually absent but the scenario is sometimes given a rough side, notably in the middle of the film that seems fuzzy by moments and the psychology of the characters remains sketchy. Jack's demeanor sometimes remains a little incoherent which stops Travolta's performance to be startling.See it anyway, De Palma's stunning camera work will make you accept this work.",Blow Out
11,Quinoa1984,One of De Palma's most entertaining works: 9.5/10,10,11 January 2006,"Blow Out runs with an idea and makes it work. Brian De Palma uses the idea from Blowup (obsession over one real-time element involving murder), and transfuses it into his usual, dependable form of the suspense picture. He finds the right cast to take it through as well. This script could be taken in the wrong hands and made into lessor material, perhaps. But often it's not even the script that is as grabbing (though it does, being De Palma in his prime, have its share of wit and sweetly honest moments) as is the direction. This is a filmmaker very much in trusting with a specific storytelling style that suits the nature of the subject matter. You've got a protagonist thrust into a deceptive, shadowy kind of element, and because its a star in that role propelling it- alongside some 'choice' villains, it's never too unbelievable in its own sort of world.John Travolta (in a role displaying a little more of his range than usual) is a sound recorder for low-budget horror movies, and going over a particular crash into a river one night by a curious couple of subjects, the audio drives him into an obsession. But the story doesn't dwell fervently into it like Blowup did (then again only Antonioni, or maybe Coppola with his The Coversation, could make it that deep into it), and in a way it doesn't need to. With Nancy Allen, a cute, talented actress, there's the other part of the story to drive it forth, as she plays the passenger in the car who may or may not know more than she'll tell, even to her rescuer Travolta. Then along the way we meet some shady people including Dennis Franz and John Lithgow's characters (the latter especially, in a role un-like him but made all the more compelling for it). It leads to a climax that is one of De Palma's best as well.Blow Out doesn't kid its main audience, and thats where it finds its strengths. It's in a realm of the psychological, but it doesn't steep itself too much to become more of an experimental film like De Palma's earlier films. It also lacks some of the weaker qualities that have come in some of his later films (i.e. a good deal of plausibility or lack of caring about the characters). It at times shows its gritty side (i.e. Franz's scenes), and it also includes some great scenes between Travolta and Allen. Simply put, it's a well-done movie.",Blow Out

13,hitchcockthelegend,Superior entry on De Palma's CV.,9,4 January 2015,"Brian De Palma has always gotten a bad rap for his penchant for essaying his heroes and favourite thrillers, what often gets forgotten is just how great he could be in crafting said thrillers.Blow Out has John Travolta as a sound engineer for low budget horror movies, who while out recording sounds one night witnesses a car crash and dives into the river to rescue the call girl trapped in the back seat (Nancy Allen). Upon listening back to the footage of the crash, he hears two noises which point to a gun shot being fired at the car. So with the dead man in the car turning out to be a big political mover, he quickly finds himself spun into a web of intrigue, peril, paranoia and conspiracies. Can he and the girl stay alive long enough to solve the case?Blow Out finds De Palma at the top of his game, blending the twisty plot dynamics with virtuoso technical smarts. A number of scenes are striking, both visually and in execution and the garnering of acting performances. Pino Donaggio provides an unforgettable music score to marry up to the layers of sub-plots folding together, and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond sharpens the primary colours (pic is awash with lurid pinks and purples - true neo-noir style) to give the story a Giallo like sheen that runs concurrent with the emotional states of the major players.A sprawling and bustling Philadelphia plays host to a conspiracy sandwich, with a corking side order of the film making process. Sometimes bleak and complex (how great it is to find a true noir finale), but never over stuffed, Blow Out is both thrilling and smart, while Travolta has never been better and John Lithgow is tailor made as the unstoppable crack-pot unleashed into our two protagonists' world. 9/10",Blow Out
14,Theo Robertson,Spoiled By My Over Familarity Of The Director's Work,5,28 February 2005,"I'm rather sad at having to give BLOW OUT 5/10 . I'm sure that if I'd seen this many years ago my vote would have been much higher . The problem with watching in 2005 is that I've become too over familiar with the work of Brian De Palma , I'm sorry to say this but he's a film maker lacking in much variety and BLOW OUT features all of the director's trade marks: The steady cam as it films the murderers point of view , the slow mo sequence as the killer descends on his prey , garish colours , hell we even have John Lithgow as a murderer and Dennis Franz as a cop . How many times has that happened in a De Palma movie ? Not to be too negative this is BLOW UP done in a Alfred Hitchcock manner . While De Palma tries to emulate the master of of suspense a bit too much he does make a far more involving movie than the tedious and pretentious Anglo Italian movie from the 1960s . It's okay as a thriller , it's just that it feels like most of Brian De Palma's other movies",Blow Out
15,jotix100,The scream!,8,2 August 2005,"Brian DePalma was at the height of his film career when he undertook the direction of ""Blow Out"". Some comments to this forum have compared it to other distinguished films like Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" and Michaelangelo Antonioni's ""Blow Up"", a comparison that seems to make sense, in a way, but Mr. DePalma, who wrote his own screen play, is an intelligent man who didn't need to copy anything from those masters of the cinema.In fact, ""Blow Out"" has kept its impact as a thriller mystery with its political overtones as it mixes crime with the lives of influential people that might give viewers a point of reference between the movie and actual historical facts.We are given an introduction to Jack's line of work as we watch scenes of the porno film that he is working on as a sound technician. The only thing that is needed is a real scream which the many actresses, either on the film itself, or being auditioned, can't produce. Whatever comes out of those women's throats are wimpy sounds, not a horror yell for help.Jack, who is out one night recording sounds for future ventures, captures the shot that causes the ""blow out"" and makes a car plunge into a creek. Jack abandons everything and jumps to rescue whoever he can save. He is only successful in bringing Sally out of the water. This is the beginning of Jack's involvement into the mystery behind the actual fact.Mr. DePalma's thriller is visually stylish. He photographed the movie in Philadelphia. The film has the excellent Vilmos Zsigmond behind the camera. The atmospheric music by Pino Donoggio serves the movie well.John Travolta's career was in decline when he made this movie. He gives a terrific performance as the sound effect man who stumbles in a conspiracy to eliminate the witnesses to the accident. Nancy Allen is not as effective as Sally, the young prostitute at the center of the story. Being married to the director might have helped her land the part, which with some other actress might have paid off better. John Lighgow is perfectly creepy as Burke, the evil man. Dennis Franz has the pivotal part of Karp, the man who was able to photograph the whole incident.""Blow Out"" is a must see for all Brian DePalma's admirers.",Blow Out
16,Doylenf,Another DePalma thriller that owes a lot to Hitchcock...,6,30 August 2006,"BLOW OUT deserves more attention than a lot of other thrillers from the '80s, partly because it's taut with suspense most of the time and owes a lot of its chill to JOHN LITHGOW's performance as a cold-blooded psychotic killer. It's also one of JOHN TRAVOLTA's best early roles as a soundman looking for ""the perfect scream"" for one of his horror movies who accidentally shoots some film of a car careening off a bridge. He dives into the water to try saving the victims but is only able to rescue the woman (NANCY ALLEN). It turns out that the driver was a senator who was a presidential candidate (shades of Chappaquiddick).From then on, the mystery deepens as he comes to suspect there's some kind of conspiracy involved. DENNIS FRANZ is Allen's boss, a sleazy photographer, who offers to help Travolta. The whole story is filmed with all the DePalma camera tricks and touches that keep the suspense boiling until the climactic shoot-out at the climax.But it's JOHN LITHGOW who steals the film as the merciless killer with undisclosed political reasons for his murderous mission.A forgotten gem among the stylish DePalma films that deserves more recognition today. I'm not much of a Travolta fan, but this is one of his better roles.",Blow Out
17,preppy-3,This actually improves with age,7,30 November 2010,"Sound man Jack Terry (John Travolta) is out one night recording sounds for a movie. He witnesses a car accident--and also records a gun shot that might have caused the accident. He saves Sally (Nancy Allen) from the crash but the man in the car is dead. It turns out he was in line to be the governor and this might be an assassination attempt--and Jack and Sally find themselves in terrible danger.This was dismissed in 1981 as another attempt from DePalma to imitate Hitchcock with a flimsy storyline. It was also attacked for its blatant misogyny--even going too far for DePalma! Within the first five minutes we see topless women dancing, another topless woman having sex with her boyfriend, another masturbating (but--surprise!--she's not topless) and a nude woman taking a shower. We also later on witness two brutal murders of women that have nothing to do with the plot! However, considering what DePalma has given us lately, this is a pretty good movie.I found it boring and confusing back in 1981. I STILL think it's a little slow in parts but that actually helps the movie as a whole. The plot unfolds slowly but when it gets going it doesn't stop. It all leads up to a silly, but exciting, car chase through Philadelphia. There's also a genuinely funny subplot about a director of Travolta trying to find a perfect scream for a horror movie he's doing. Also DePalma's excellent direction and incredible use of split screen helps. Even better, and more surprising, was Travolta's great performance. He literally explodes a few times and it's incredible. I also like Allen even if she does play the role as a little TOO dumb. Unknowns Dennis Franz and John Lithgow also play small but key roles. So, misogyny aside this is one of DePalma's better movies. I give it a 7.",Blow Out

19,grantss,"Derivative, unoriginal thriller from Brian De Palma",5,13 May 2015,"Between making brilliant movies like Scarface and Carlito's Way and some fairly decent movies like The Untouchables, Casualties of War and Carrie, Brian De Palma makes mostly derivative, unoriginal stuff like this. His previous movie, Dressed to Kill, was clearly a Hitchcock ripoff, and more style than substance. This is a ripoff of Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow-Up, with a bit of Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation thrown in. What is different to these is quite clichéd - pretty much standard murder-thriller fare. There is more substance to this than Dressed to Kill though.Performances are fine though. John Travolta is solid in the lead role and Nancy Allen makes for a decent damsel-in-distress. John Lithgow is chillingly good as the villain.",Blow Out
20,view_and_review,Twice Heated Microwave Dinner,5,14 December 2019,"Blow Out was moderately intriguing until the end. Whether they were going for maximum drama or they just didn't know how to finish it, it went south the moment Jack (John Travolta) decided to wire Sally (Nancy Allen). The ending was beyond bad and so was the music that went with it.OK, just to catch you up to the ending I want so badly to mention: Jack is a soundman for movies. While he's in a park recording sounds he catches the sound of a car skidding off the road and plummeting into a creek. He dives into the water, saves Sally, but the other occupant of the vehicle, Governor McRyan, drowns.Jack knows that it was no accident because he hears a bang before the car skids off the road and nothing is adding up. Jack also gets a hold of video evidence of his supposition that the car going off the road was no accident. After some introspection he decides to go public with what he knows and Sally is instrumental in that.Now the ending...Jack wires Sally as she goes to give the tapes to who she thinks is the news anchorman, but is actually the assassin (John Lithgow). This course of action didn't even make sense because the anchorman wanted to meet Jack and Sally, so there was no need for Jack to hide in the background while Sally delivered the audio and video tapes. It was done solely to advance the plot because Sally didn't watch news hence she would never know who the anchorman was. It's a dumb plot device to say the least, but let's move on.When Sally and the assassin hop on the train Jack couldn't keep up, so he jumped in his vehicle and sped across the eerily empty streets of Philadelphia to catch up to them. He busted through a police barricade and even a parade to eventually crash into a department store window and knock himself out in the process.When he awoke in the back of an ambulance--unrestrained I might add, even though he nearly killed dozens of people--he resumed his pursuit of Sally and the assassin because apparently the assassin patiently waited for Jack to regain consciousness before he resumed his plan of killing Sally.Jack didn't get to the assassin in time to save Sally from being strangled to death, but he got there in time to prevent her body from being mutilated with puncture wounds from an ice pick. He was even able to guide the assassin's hand to his own chest cavity several times because clearly the assassin was so weak as to let a guy grab his hand and force him to stab himself over and over.Look, the movie wasn't going to be great, but it had a chance at being decent.

21,evanston_dad,Mostly Excellent Film Marred by Bad Ending,8,10 September 2013,"""Blow Out,"" Brian DePalma's 1981 thriller, is three fourths of a great film capped off by a preposterous, off-the-rails ending.John Travolta gives a very good performance as a movie sound man who captures the audio of a car crash that kills a U.S. presidential candidate. What he hears leads him to believe that the crash was no accident, and he becomes obsessed with convincing the authorities that the incident needs to be investigated while they would rather brush it under the rug.The film bears similarities to Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film ""The Conversation,"" though Coppola's is by far the better of the two. ""Blow Out"" might have given it some stiff competition had DePalma not let his love of style over substance overcome his good sense and given us an ending that completely unravels and makes no narrative sense. Still, ending aside, the film leading up to that point is stylish and dripping with paranoid atmosphere, and there's a pre-opening-credits sequence that alone is worth the price of admission. When I think back on the movie, I think about all the good stuff in it rather than the stupid ending, so I guess in that regard it deserves a high score from me.Nancy Allen delivers a grating performance as a love interest for Travolta and someone who's also implicated in the ""accident,"" while John Lithgow plays a creepy psycho.Grade: A-",Blow Out
22,gridoon2021,Gripping but flawed De Palma thriller,6,22 March 2016,"Although ""Blow Out"" is more highly regarded critically than Brian De Palma's subsequent ""Body Double"", a recent re-viewing of both films leads me to the opinion that the latter is the more entertaining film of the two. Or, to be more specific, ""Body Double"" has the better first two acts, and ""Blow Out"" the better third act. The problem with ""Blow Out""'s first two acts is that the script keeps pounding you over the head with the fact that ""the tire was shot, it was not a blow out"" long after even the last audience member has understood that. And as if that's not enough, there is even a scene in the middle that spells out everything about the assassination, including who the killer was! The final third and the climax are suspenseful and excitingly staged by De Palma, but you cannot overlook that Travolta makes an unforgivable error of judgment when he lets Nancy Allen go and meet the ""reporter"" alone. On the positive side, there is genuine emotion in the relationship between Travolta and Allen, John Lithgow is terrifying as the psychopathic killer, and the ending is undeniably powerful. **1/2 out of 4.",Blow Out

John Lithgow, Dennis Franz and Nancy Allen are all somehow involved in the nefarious conspiracy.Written & directed by Brian De Palma, ""Blow Out"" (1981) is a crime drama/thriller whose colors, artistic style, cast and Philadelphia locations make it worthwhile. It's similar to Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" (1974) but more dynamic. Allen plays a ditzy character, yet is alluring and enjoyable, while Travolta is in his prime. Meanwhile Lithgow makes for a great shady character.I loved the colorful, well-staged sequence under the Henry Avenue Bridge, but started to lose interest in the second half for some reason.

I mean, yeah, it's entertaining, but it's not nearly as good as the two films it's ripping off, Antonioni's Blow-Up and Coppola's The Conversation. Plus, the actors are no good. Travolta (who is, I should say, probably my least favorite actor of all time; besides Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction, I have no use for him) and Nancy Allen (who was okay in RoboCop, but her bimbo acting here is horribly grating) are both awful in the leads, as is Dennis Franz in a major supporting role. The only decent performance comes from John Lithgow, although he's nowhere near as awesome in this role as he was in a similar role on the television show Dexter a couple years ago (surely inspired by this film). The poor performances don't take much away from the film's entertainment value, thankfully. In De Palma's sketchy career, I don't think this one stands out.

The acting of Nancy Allen though is a letdown, I don't know if it is because of her dumb character or just because that's all she can do but this was clearly the weakest point of Blow Out.

29,StevePulaski,An aesthetically-sublime thriller,9,8 March 2014,"The great Alfred Hitchcock would've been delighted to see Brian De Palma's Blow Out but he would've been more satisfied with actually making the film. The film deals with many of the themes Hitchcock did in his heyday such as voyeurism, the figurative ""MacGuffin,"" the intense mystery, the likable characters, and the slick presence of style by a tried-and-true cinephile.De Palma casts Blow Out in a deeply bleak light. Shot on film obviously, with very dark tonalities and very dingily-lit environments to establish an effective mood, De Palma centers the film around Jack Terry (John Travolta), a local sound engineer who loves working with the wondrous and limitless medium of audio and sound. To him, regular sounds have a distinct poetry to them, bearing a natural and too often unseen realm of musicality.One day Jack ventures outside to capture sounds of trees being rustled by the wind for a low-budget film he's working on when he witnesses a brutal car wreck right before his eyes. The vehicle appears to suffer from a blown tire before it careens off a bridge and into the water below. Without doing much thinking, Jack leaps in and is able to pull out a woman named Sally (Nancy Allen), who will later awaken in a heavily-sedated state in the hospital. The entire event is captured through Jack's sound recorder.Jack is the only witness to the crime, and is told at the hospital room that the man who died in the accident was the governor and a possible presidential candidate. One of the governor's advisers tells Jack to remain silent about what he saw, and tells Sally that she would be best off to skip town for a few months, seeing as she is a simple escort who would never want to be seen with the married governor. However, when a frame-by-frame layout of a released video of the accident is released in a magazine, Jack goes through the meticulous effort of animating the video and adding the sound files into the video to try and recreate the event, albeit in a choppy, heavily-unpolished state.Jack believes that someone hiding in the bushes adjacent to the road the governor was driving on and fired a shot into the governor's vehicle's tire, leading him to lose control, swerve, and crash off the bridge. He believes the soundbite of the accident he recorded that night which houses an audible, deafening bang before the sound of tires-screeching is proof in and of itself that the governor was shot off the road in an orchestrated attempt at murder. But with the safer, less edgy story of the cover-up being played and published everywhere, Jack's efforts to look deeper into the event make him seem nothing more than a ridiculous conspiracy theorist.Travolta gives off the vibe he once did of being the young, cool-kid, yet one with a lot of brains and a lot of heart in Blow Out. Despite having a confident swagger and always seeming to be in a very assured state, the character of Jack Terry is deeply vulnerable, as he soon becomes the target of some shady figures that want to keep the governor's death look like a simple tire blow out. With Jack's professional sound engineering skills constantly being tested, the film plays like a hazy detective story that is brought to light by the use of incredible complex and unique technical equipment.De Palma's focus on the technical aspects of the sound engineering world are what makes Blow Out truly unique. We see Jack cut and paste all kinds of equipment, operate on now-primitive sound machines that allow sounds to be emphasized as well as subdued in the background, along with seeing the remarkable coherency of everything done. These technical aspects give Blow Out an added layer to its thriller, making the film more and enticing and more of a unique experience to invest in seeing as these concepts and features are scarcely explored in a film.Films about filmmaking can either get lost in a sea of self-referential humor or simply get lost in their own facile stories. Blow Out remains alive from the second it begins to the second the credits roll, with an unexpected final fifteen minutes that manage to house so much tension and suspense it's almost uncanny.Starring: John Travolta and Nancy Allen.

31,MovieAddict2016,Solid conspiracy thriller with a great twist at the end,8,29 April 2005,"""Blow Out"" is a loose remake of ""Blow-Up"" (1966) that alludes to many factual conspiracy theories and political cover-ups/events ranging from presidential assassination to the JFK Chappaquiddick accident. It uses elements from ""Blow-Up"" but, in my opinion, improves upon them and isn't as cheesy and dated as the 1966 film.It stars John Travolta as Jack, a sound effects expert who works on low-grade porn films for a living, unable to achieve anything greater. One night while out recording sounds to be used for later projects, he inadvertently captures the sound of a crashing car, personally witnessing it dive into a nearby lake of water. He jumps into the lake, rescues a girl (Nancy Allen) from within the car, and becomes a hero for about five minutes, until some suspicious men approach him at the hospital and ask him not to tell anyone what happened.Feeling uneasy about what's going on, Jack investigates into the accident and realizes that the driver of the car was a presidential nominee, and the girl was his mistress.Jack plays back his audio tape of the accident and hears something strange in the background -- a gunshot. Finally understanding that something big is going on, Jack teams up with the mistress and attempts to unveil the conspiracy surrounding the event -- whilst being pursued by a strange and mysterious hit-man (played eerily well by Jon Lithgow).""Blow Out"" is one of Quentin Tarantino's top three favorite films of all time, and like many film buffs, that was one of the only reasons I even was aware of its existence. I picked it up on DVD at a relatively cheap price, expecting a clever thriller with a (hopefully) satisfying conclusion.I would not say that ""Blow Out"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, but it is one of Brian De Palma's best films and a very good suspense thriller. It features one of John Travolta's best performances with some really great references to popular conspiracy theories, placed in a more easily accessible and realistic setting. As a result the story seems entirely convincing and scary; De Palma is often accused of copying Hitchcock, and although there are definite homages to the Master of Suspense in ""Blow Out,"" De Palma also implements enough of his own tricks into the film to establish himself as one of the best directors of the time. (What a shame that he had to go downhill from here.) The final twist at the end of the movie is totally unexpected. It's not your typical thriller conclusion where there's a big surprise -- instead the fate of the characters themselves is the surprise and for that reason alone I would say ""Blow Out"" is far more unique than many other films in its genre.Recommended.",Blow Out

It turns out that she's been having an affair with the driver, who happens to be a leading candidate for the presidency, and his handlers are desperate to keep the affair secret. Meanwhile, Terry realizes that this accident isn't an accident and he sets out to prove that it's really a political assassination.It's not a bad movie, and has a few twists and turns that make it interesting, although I found it hard to believe that McRyan's handlers would be so worried about the reputation of their candidate once he wasn't their candidate any more. (I know, they wanted to protect his family.) Travolta's performance was pretty good, but Nancy Allen as Sally (McRyan's lover) grated on me after a while. John Lithgow also appears as an ice cold hit-man, and although I had trouble picturing him in that role, he actually pulled it off pretty well. There's also a convincing enough appearance from Dennis Franz as a sleazy photographer who's associated with Sally.

35,lost-in-limbo,Did you hear that the sound of murder,9,14 November 2009,"Brian De Palma's ''Blow Out'' starring John Travolta, Nancy Allen and John Lithgow would go down as my favourite film (just ahead of ""Causalities of War"" and ''Dressed to Kill'') of his on-going filmography. Usually I find him to be an on-and-off director, and ''Blow Out'' was switched on. It's one of those presentations that doesn't just hold you there with its captivating sombre murder mystery (similar to Blow-Up and 'The Conversation') relating to a political conspiracy, but also De Palma's showy technical side is nothing short than exquisitely striking. Well you might say that's the case for most of his work, however on this occasion its extremely well controlled to balance the story and it isn't so much the peering camera and sharp editing (although still commendably evident and how can you go wrong with split frames) but the ingenious use of sound effects and the ironic nature of our main protagonist being an audio technician for b-grade horror movies (which within the building he works bestows some cool horror posters that fans will surely pick up on).The layered story has that old-fashion noir quality, with the momentum building upon mood and suspense constructing illuminating atmospherics and consisting of fitting performances. While the brooding plot screws around with its webby developments and taut tension, never does the suspiciously tactical script entirely pick it apart with any sort of depth or rationality. In the end its quite basic. However this made the harrowing impact of the film's conclusion even more lasting, as the emotional brunt came from De Palma's intensely slick visual work like the stirring slow-motion climax with Pino Donaggio's harrowing score (which holds a delightfully crisp and variable arrangement throughout). It's top drawer in De Palma's illustratively intimate details oozing with colour, tones and shades with it being served by some beautifully projected expressive photography and a lingering nasty current. An excellent John Travolta brings a convicted temperament to the lead and a bubbling Nancy Allen adds a perky injection. A precisely scheming performance by John Lithgow is truly menacing. Also in support is Denis Franz.An enjoyably stylish, if simple thriller.",Blow Out
36,Lejink,Audio - visual thriller,8,18 August 2010,"I'm a big De Palma fan and watching this for the first time since its original release, must say that I think it's about the best of his work I've seen. Much as he might dislike the ""latter-day"" Hitchcock sobriquet, to me this is the kind of work I reckon the Master would have turned out if he'd still been around in the 80's. That said, there was one sequence near the end where in succeeding scenes, I was reminded of key parts of ""Foreign Correspondent"", ""Saboteur"" and ""To Catch A Thief"", but being an even bigger fan of Hitch, that's fine - sort of how I like the band Oasis but love their progenitor, The Beatles...""Blow-Out"" benefits above all else from a taut story-line, mixing elements of the Kennedy brothers ruinous experiences at Dallas and Chappaquiddick, placing John Travolta's sound engineer at the centre of a major conspiracy plot following the death of a prominent US congressman. Of course, it wouldn't be De Palma if elements of the story weren't fantastical and reliant on massive coincidences at times, but there are so many bravura scenes that you're swept along breathlessly to the colourful and exciting conclusion.Travolta, hot from ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease"", you can see is still a little gauche at times but this actually serves his free-spirited character pretty well, while Nancy Allen is fine the slightly dim and ultimately too trusting ""honey-trap"" with whom Travolta teams up. John Lithgow's character is too over the top as the hired hit-man, who exceeds his brief to the extent that he morphs into a serial killer along the way, but this allows De Palma the opportunity to stage some memorable deaths, his killing of the second victim in the train station a masterpiece of execution, if you'll pardon the pun.There are several other memorable scenes, like Allen's ""Topaz""-like dispatching of her pimp in his apartment, the climax in front of a giant illuminated American flag at the Liberty Bell parade, while the director is also careful to enlighten us as to just how Travolta's job fortuitously enables him to detect the original crime, updating Antonioni's photographic method for doing the same in ""Blow-Up"", obviously this movie's title points the way back to the source.I could go on and on about De Palma's attention-grabbing traits (for one thing, count how many times red dominates the background scenes) but for once with him, the movie's the star, not the set-pieces.",Blow Out
37,ElMaruecan82,"""Blow Out"" will blow your mind... and shatter your heart...",9,5 February 2021,"You know when you're watching a De Palma film that nothing is gratuitous: style is the visual embodiment of a camera philosophy, a vision on the director's vision, something rooted in technicality but tracing the very framework where characters can fully express themselves. Whether for his use of split screens, dark blood-colored lights or for his instinct for head-spinning editing, characters inhabit the visuality so we can inhabit their tormented souls. He's not Hitchcock but like Tarantino said, he got the closest to what Hitchcock could have done had he lived for another thirty years.""Blow Out"" does open like a poor man's Hitchcock film, a cheap slasher with crassly sexist undertones through a POV peeping over girls dancing naked in some neighborhood depicted like a sexploitation version of ""Rear Window"". A by-stander is stabbed to death, we see the camera hovering through ominous corridors and stopping in a shower room where the killer reveals his face on the mirror. He's creepy in a cheesy way. Then it takes ten full seconds for the girl to realize the threat. And when she does, well obviously she's no Janet Leigh or Fay Wray.Then the film cuts to the real story and we realized we've been fooled by De Palma and his devilishly Hitchcockian sense of humor. It was a movie in the movie and we're in the world of sleazy X-rated films and Jack Terry (John Travolta) along with his producer is mocking the weirdness of the scream. This is not just the protagonist laughing but De Palma telling us that he's much aware of the risk of reducing style to the level of patch-and-paint tricks but in his case, style will be a narrative language, a means to an end that is a haunting love story caught up in the midst of a political conspiracy.As De Palma told Noah Braumbach, any director would be tempted to start a thriller with the typical geographical urban shots (and some good movies sinned by that trope) but he values his material so professionally that he's got to offer something from the very start. So the opening plunges us in the world of Jack, a sound engineer who specialized in recording sounds for the movies; winds, door closing and occasionally a female shrill scream. That his movies aren't exactly first-rate pictures is besides the point, his dedication to his F/X work is inspiring as it is to watch Travolta (in his first mature role) handling his equipment.And because we're enthralled by that character and his self-confidence, we're absorbed by his meticulousness: we listen to the silences from which he uses that long mike to pick up the subtle little noises, we enjoy watching him eavesdropping people's private conversations while a howling owl spins his head in our direction, keeping us on the edge before we're caught off guard: suddenly, a car is careening off the road and falls in the creek, Jack plunges and rescues Sally (Nancy Allen) from the drowning. The male passenger is dead. Later he learns that she escorted a popular Senator and potential candidate for the Presidency. His aides asks him to forget about the girl and avoid the family embarrassment.The performances are interesting: Terry doesn't care about publicity and accepts the deal, he plays a decent man who's eager to help and Allen a girl who's so used to be exploited that it takes time before she breaks her façade. As the film progresses their interactions get more genuine and sincere, first she's still under the dozing effect of sedatives then she puts on an act: the pretty girl with big dreams to take her off her miserable condition. And finally when she learns that she's been used to frame a politician, her decency makes one with Terry's and together they decide to fight for the truth.Like in Antonioni's ""Blow Up"", apparences take time to fade out before unveiling dark truths and Terry sees himself being caught in a great political muddle to which he possesses the sole evidence, he knows from the sounds he recorded it wasn't an accident, there was a gunshot. The film is inspired by Abraham Zapruder and the Chappaquiddick scandal that cost Ted Kennedy his Presidency and convinces us that pictures and sounds can tell the truth... or hide it. The man who took the photographs of the accident (Dennis Franz) is the corrupt counterpart of Jack Terry and the contrast is underlined by their physical difference and their treatment of Sally.The truth becomes the real question, a sort of existential quest in many levels: it relies on the one thing Terry masters more than anyone, his girl's life is threatened and it's also a personal issue because Terry has already failed in a previous mission involving an undercover operation and you can tell he wants to redeem himself. All these torments actions finally converge toward as spectacular race against an invisible villain played by John Lithgow, where technology becomes the hero's weapon.Like Hitchcock, De Palma makes a film of ordinary people caught in extraordinary situations, showing us how a camera or sound can be a double-edged sword or how one part of the truth but half the truth can be more dangerous or misleading than a lie. The tragedy of Terry is that he's never suspected the existence of Burke but how could he? He was a man of sound, not a vision and when the picture gets clear, it's too late. That's the genius of De Palma, he toys with us like Burke or conspirators with Terry, as if behind every good director there's the inner talent of concealing the truth.And the scream that starts as a joke will also take a sad, poignant resonance at the end. As far as psychological thrillers go, ""Blow Out"" will certainly blow your mind... and shatter your heart..",Blow Out

It's a pretty simple plot that mashes up Antonioni's Blowup, the Zapruder film, and Chappaquiddick, but didn't create something interesting out of it - and De Palma's references are too transparent for my taste. Perhaps because of the weakness of the story and an overall lack of real tension (Hitchcock he is not), the additional plot element of the ""Liberty Bell Strangler"" is introduced, which just seemed silly to me. The acting is also below average at best, except maybe John Lithgow, who is suitably menacing. Nancy Allen's character and her performance, on the other hand, are putrid.

The ending sequence was good, kinda reminded me of directors other jobs he doen years after this movie.Overall, ""Blow Out's"" best thing i think was Brian De Palma. From a desent but not that memorable story of ""who and how dunnit"" he made some scenes that truly work, especially the very intense ending, but even that one had some flaws. Overall, a not bad thriller to see it once, but nothing that memorable.",Blow Out
40,Dr_Coulardeau,Very well done but kind of banal,9,6 October 2007,"This Brian de Palma film is essential in our western cinema. It picks the theme so marvelously exploited by Hitchcock of the voyeur who sees a crime (Room with a view), a murder being committed. But of course he has to develop the theme. Here the voyeur is a sound technician of the cinema industry who one nights sees, hears and records a presidential candidate being assassinated in the shape of a car accident, at the same time as a photographer was filming the same scene for some political and of course immoral and even criminal but politically and professionally correct project. It is when a serial killer of some kind gets into the picture and starts satisfying his desire to kill women, women of a certain type, at the same time as he cleans up the plate of the conspirators and plotters for the political assassination never to come out in the open. He destroys evidence. He tampers with state evidence. He eliminates witnesses and along with them a few more just for his personal fun. The film does not show any real deep meaning that has not been dealt with and developed over and over in the cinema. Politics are rotten. Nothing new under the sun. Politicians are sexual perverts. Nothing new under the sun. Police, media, simple people, everyone are only interested in non-disturbing, non-disquieting facts, even if they are absolutely false. The only positive point of this film, maybe even a new element, is the fact that an essential popular parade is totally disturbed by the main character running after the criminal in order to prevent his killing the direct witness of the murder. And yet the parade goes on as if nothing was happening. When society is celebrating its belly-button nothing can divert it from contemplating that belly button. And that is the power of criminals who use this narcissistic fascination to commit and cover their crimes. Don't worry they are not the only ones. In fact politicians are good too at doing that and what's more they can decide when and where the celebrations can take place to cover up their shortcomings, mistakes or even crimes.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Blow Out

42,matthewssilverhammer,A forgotten gem,9,19 October 2019,"This is the best argument for De Palma being Hitchcock's heir-apparent, this being his skewed cover of Rear Window. A representation of the gaslighting of American citizens by the powers-that-be, this is my favorite of his films, & one of the great paranoid thrillers.

43,GOWBTW,"Great thriller, disappointing ending",8,27 December 2018,"Brian DePalma deserves a big deal of credit for his work. In ""Blow Out"", he brings ""Carrie"" stars, John Travolta and Nancy Allen. John played a sound producer for movies, and Nancy, a prostitute/make-up artist. John is Jack, who does sound effects who unknowingly recorded a blowout that turns out more sinister. Nancy is Sally, a prostitute/make-up artist who gets involved in a scandal which resulted in a up and rising politician's death. The unlikely duo team up to expose the truth about the blow out was no freak accident. Jack(Travolta) tries his best to get the truth out there, but a sinister strangler named Burke(John Lithgow) will do his best to discredit Jack.
DePalma is known for his edgy storytelling, however the results isn't to my liking. One must get the truth about something, yet there's a conniving conspirator who will do his or her best to discredit the protagonist.
I know the ending is not what I expected, but the movie was intense all the way. No putdowns whatsoever.

44,BeneCumb,"Slightly timeworn, but still a strong A-movie",7,26 April 2013,"As the pace and types of characters are specific to the US crime thrillers from the 1970ies, Blow Out could be too slow and trivial to those used to fast change of scenes, heavy noises, chases with shootings etc. Sometimes I also wanted to use fast-forward function for speeding up obvious activities without changes or lines. Nevertheless, performances by all frequent male actors (John Travolta, John Lithgow, Dennis Franz) were catchy to follow; Nancy Allen's character Sally was too ""chick"" for me. And the inclusion of a carnival fest - I have seen too much of movies with this element...The ending is unexpected, but not satisfying - when the credits appear, you feel astonished and betrayed. This is also a reason why the movie did not make well in cinemas.",Blow Out
45,jadavix,Travolta's best performance in a good thriller,8,19 March 2016,"""Blow Out"" is rightly regarded as John Travolta's best acting performance. Normally he coasts through his movies on his charm and charisma, whether playing a straight arrow or a psychopath. He's always effective but usually rather one-note. In ""Blow Out"", however, we see a far greater range than even his fans probably thought possible.The film is not De Palma's greatest thriller, however. I believe that honour belongs to ""Dressed to Kill"", made the year before. Whereas Travolta fires on all cylinders, the movie itself fails to generate tension in some key areas, namely a car/train chase through a parade in broad daylight. The music, which includes one of Pino Donaggio's most memorable scores, seems designed to generate yearning, but there is nothing for the main character to yearn for until the very end. Thus it is at odds with some of the action: the car case, specifically.Aside from this we also get a typically top notch performance from John Lithgow as a killer. De Palma, however, seems curiously muted; there are his usual touches such as split screen and extreme close ups of faces on the left of the frame as they listen to action shown on the right, farther away but still in the same shot. It just doesn't generate the same tension we know he was capable of.Perhaps he had to keep a distance to get the best out of Travolta.",Blow Out
46,ackstasis,"""No one wants to know about conspiracy any more""",8,1 January 2011,"I've been loving Brian De Palma's work in the past year or so. He has the schlocky sensibilities of William Castle, but a cinematic style that is pure Hitchcock. 'Blow Out (1981)' was obviously inspired by high- class films; its title references Antonioni's celebrated mystery/thriller 'Blowup (1966),' and the story borrows heavily from Coppola's 'The Conversation (1974).'But the film itself begins like the trashiest of 1970s slasher horrors, taking the first-person view of a serial killer as he stalks through a ""typical"" sorority house. De Palma delights in the over-the-top titillation of it all, ultimately playing the viewer for a sucker: this opening sequence is actually a scene from a tasteless B-movie on which our protagonist Jack (John Travolta) is working as a sound-effects editor. Sound is an essential part of the film.While recording night-time audio for his movie, Jack witnesses a passing car plunge into the river. He rescues a woman (Nancy Allen) from the water, but the driver, a future Presidential candidate, dies. Details of the accident are covered up as quickly as possible. When he listens to his tape recording, Jack thinks he hears a gunshot preceding the blow out of the car's tyres. Has he captured evidence of a political assassination? And how far will ""they"" go to destroy the evidence?De Palma's stylistic flourishes are unmistakable, but they rarely distract from the story. In one scene, recalling the steady pull-back from an impending murder in Hitchcock's 'Frenzy (1972),' the camera literally swoops away from a bloody murder scene into a bustling street of oblivious pedestrians. (De Palma once again used a shot like this in 'Scarface (1983)' for the notorious chainsaw scene). In another sequence, when Jack realises that his tapes have been magnetically erased, the camera begins to rotate, and doesn't stop, superbly capturing the euphoria of the character's predicament.",Blow Out
47,robfollower,Blow Out (1981),9,28 March 2020,"Director: Brian De Palma
Writer: Brian De Palma
Stars: John Travolta, Nancy Allen, John LithgowThe subtlety of the film does not alter the fact that it does not reside in the confines of any one genre. Untraditional and exciting, Blow Out also provided John Travolta to play an adult role and emerge from the shadow of some of his earlier successes. It also reunited the actor with De Palma, and his Carrie co-star, Nancy Allen. These two give spectacular performances in this twisted and darkly pessimistic tale about a sound effects specialist going up against a powerful political assassination cover-up.Travolta stars as a sound effects guy named Jack, who mostly works on sleazy B-films. When he is recording in the park at night, Jack inadvertently witnesses and records the accident which results in the death of a possible presidential candidate. Jack is able to save the passenger of the car, a young woman named Sally Allen, whose presence in the car is kept secret at the respect of the political figure's family.When Jack listens to the accident, which is said to have been cause by a tire blow out, he hears a bang before the tire blows. Believing that this is a gunshot, Jack decides to try and take on the figure who embodies the cover-up (John Lithgow), using Sally as his way to the truth.Blow Out is definitely one of the strongest, most visually exciting thrillers of the 1980s, but while it has a lot of very devoted fans, it's nowhere near as well-known as it should be. De Palma's more iconic efforts from that period, like Scarface and The Untouchables, have probably overshadowed it, but this film deserves more recognition. 9/10",Blow Out
48,st-shot,Blow Out is Flat,3,22 July 2021,"Hitchcock manque Brian DiPalma clearly borrows from the best and here he's lifting from Antonionni (Blow-Up) and Coppola (The Conversation) but with diminishing returns in Blow-Up. From an impressively intriguing start involving a slasher production it quickly devolves into a rancid political thriller minus the thrills, saddled with laughable performances from the leads.Audio sound man Jack Terry (John Travolta )is out doing research one night when he stumbles upon a botched attempt to slander a political candidate that results in the candidate dying. Terry saves the passenger, a call girl (Nancy Allen) out to make the pol look bad and he soon finds himself caught up in some very dangerous intrigue with folks in high places.Travolta looks clueless most of the way and whimpers while dim witted Allen plays it wide eyed and gullible and John Lithgow's sadistic serial killer oozes implausibility. . Vilmos Zsigmond's camera work is exceptional but DiPalma's direction is sloppy and distracted culminating in a climax involving a mid day parade chase scene that unexplainably later picks up that evening, one would guess to showcase a fireworks show.

I found the film thinly plotted, and it failed to engage me. It was stylishly directed and photographed, but eventually the director's ego became TOO noticeable, and began to detract from the film. The only performer who stood out was John Lithgow. I had seen him play the villain in ""Ricochet"" but mostly I had seen him in the drama mode, ""Terms of Endearment"" etc., and his recent sitcom.

51,dwpollar,Wonderfully written and directed story...,8,4 October 2005,1st watched 10/03/2005 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Brian De Palma): Wonderfully written and directed story by Brian De Palma about a sound man who records an accident(we think) at a bridge while doing his job of recording sounds for a recent movie gig. We find out the accident involved a Governor who happened to be running for President of the United States and the title character(Jack played by John Travolta) just happened to rescue another person from the vehicle(who was a lady of the night played by Nancy Allen) and the Governor dies. What ensues is a major attempt to cover up some of the facts while Jack tries to piece together what he heard and saw for evidence of the foul play. He believes he heard a shot that blew out the tire of the vehicle and with an amateur photograph's pictures rigs together a pretty convincing portrait of the truth. Travolta is great in what I consider one of his best acting stints but Nancy Allen is tolerable at best. This is the only real negative to this otherwise well made and pieced together thriller that works to the very end and deserved more recognition than it received.

54,ShootingShark,"Stylish, Gripping, Funny, Nail-Biting Political Conspiracy Thriller",8,21 October 2006,"Jack Terry is a movie soundman in Philadelphia out recording sounds one night when he witnesses a car crash into a creek. He jumps in and pulls out a young woman, but the driver of the car - a powerful senator - drowns. Jack is approached by the authorities to keep quiet, but when he listens to his tape he is convinced the crash was not an accident but an assassination. Can he unravel the mystery before the killer comes calling on him ? One of the most brilliant and overlooked political thrillers ever made, this is a fabulous movie featuring a dynamic career-best performance by John Travolta who sadly almost disappeared into obscurity afterwards until Pulp Fiction thirteen years later. It's very hard to play a complex lead in a densely-plotted thriller and yet somehow he manages to be exciting, tender, funny and guilt-ridden, all the while holding the story-threads together. Allen is fun as the dopey call-girl, Franz hits a new high in his sleazebag roles for DePalma (he doesn't even stop talking when he goes to the bathroom), and Lithgow is truly chilling as the Gordon Liddy-styled hard-as-nails killer with the coolest garrotte in cinema. The problem I have with most political thrillers is that they're all talk and no action (The Parallax View, The China Syndrome) - they may be credible but they're dull; Blow Out gets its balance of plot-twists, social commentary and hair-raising moments exactly right. It contains everything you could want to know about Nixon-era political tricks (wire-taps, surveillance, police coverups, etc), but it also has some seriously scary stalking scenes, a giddy chase through a Liberty Day parade and an amusing subplot about dubbing a horror flick. It combines DePalma's love of style and technique (split-screen, montages, complex shots, slow-motion) with his love of film engineering and technology, as Jack makes an animated film of the crash from newspaper stills and dubs his soundtrack onto them using lovely old moviolas and analogue tape machines. There's an extraordinary shot at one point when Jack finds all his tapes have been erased and the camera spins slowly around his studio, literally dizzying us with the bewildering conspiracy surrounding him. Vilmos Zsigmond's photography is stunning throughout and Pino Donaggio's lush score is haunting and poignant. The one criticism that could possibly be levelled against this movie is that it cribs from many sources, notably Rashomon, Vertigo, and Blowup (explicit in the title), and the premise is a variation on the infamous 1969 Chappaquiddick incident (senator Ted Kennedy crashed his car into a sea-channel and escaped but his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned). But DePalma's script is as perfectly manicured as his visuals, and has lots of good ideas of its own; Lithgow's trick of murdering two other women prior to Allen to make her death look like the work of a serial killer is a brilliant twist, and one that's been used in many subsequent thrillers. And the usual protest against DePalma's work - that he has no interest in character and directs clinically - is usually unjustified, but particularly so here - Jack is a nice guy with a guilty conscience and Travolta imbues him with energy, warmth, humour and tragic pathos. This movie is everything a good thriller should be and, along with William Richert's equally low-profile Winter Kills, is the touchstone American political conspiracy movie.",Blow Out
55,a_chinn,DePalma and Travolta's best film of their careers (and that's saying something),10,17 February 2020,"Possibly my favorite Brian DePalma film (and boy that's a hard call. ""Carlito's Way,"" ""The Untouchables,"" ""Casualties of War,"" etc.). John Travolta, in the best performance of his career, plays a low-budget horror film sound editor who while out one evening recording some nature sounds happens to record a Chappaquiddick-like situation where a politician crashes his car into the water. But wait! Was there a gunshot to be heard on that recording? And what became of the woman Travolta pulled from the car? A lose remake of Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Blow Up,"" where a fashion photographer realizes he may have snapped a picture of a murder and continues to blow up the photo, revealing more and more clues each time he enlarges the photo, which is where the story of ""Blow Out"" goes as well, with Travolta listening closer and closer to what's on his audio recording. Like many DePalma films, ""Blow Out"" is not for all tastes, but it delivers his usual operatic suspense set pieces and also delivers his most emotional denouement to any of his films. Without spoiling anything, I cringe every time at Travolta's pain in the film's final moments. Besides De Palma, the talent behind the camera is truly impressive, including Academy Award winners Vilmos Zsigmond (""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" ""The Deer Hunter""), editor Paul Hirsch (who worked with De Palma since his first film and went on the work on multiple Star Wars films and multiple Mission Impossible films), and production designer Paul Sylbert (""""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" ""Heaven Can Wait"" ""The Prince of Tides""). And although he's never won an Academy Award, probably because he's primarily worked in genre pictures, composer Pino Donaggio (""Don't Look Now"" ""The Howling"" ""Carrie"") delivers another soaring score, and is one of his best in his long collaboration with DePalma, which continues to this day. Also of note, there are memorable performances from John Lithgow and Dennis Franz, with Lithgow as a G. Gordon Liddy type figure and Franz as a sleazy low class pimp. If I had to read a subtext into the film, I'd say it's a sly celebration of cinema, where Travolta's Jack Terry uses the tools of filmmaking, sound, images, editing, to tell different stories and reveal new truths, the essence of cinema. The film also contains DePalma's ongoing obsessions with guilt, sex, and voyeurism. For those who accuse DePalma of being a misogynist, Nancy Allen's ridiculously feeble brained character probably helps bolster that argument, but she does give an undeniably sympathetic performance (Allen was DePalma's real life wife at the time). If there was ever a remake of this film, I'm sure her character would be the first thing they changed. Despite this, I'm still giving the film five starts because the rest of the film is such an amazing cinematic experience and remains one of my all-time favorite films. FUN FACT! Quentin Tarantino cast Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"" because he was such a fan of the film and Travolta's performance.",Blow Out
56,vertigo_14,If you liked F/X...,7,4 April 2004,"If you liked F/X, you'll probably like Blow Out and vice versa because both films involve a person who uses their craft to solve a highly corrupt case of murder. While F/X's Rollie Tyler was a special effects engineer, our hero in Blow Out is a sound technician who must piece together parts of a sound recording (along with some other vital information from other sources along the way) to solve the murder of the gubernatorial candidate, a death which the police have written off as a homocide. Travolta employs Nancy Allen's help, a rather dumb prostitute who was in the car with the victim when their car ran off the bridge, but who is the only survivor and essential key to unlocking the mystery. They are dealing with a very relentless killer who will stop at nothing to make sure the trail of evidence leading to him is eliminated.
It is a typical DePalma movie in that it is done with many Hitchcock elements (they didn't call him the master of suspense for nothing) and also that he works with movies-in-a-movie (see 'Body Double' and 'Dressed to Kill'). It is an enjoyable crime and mystery movie in the days when John Travolta movies were still fun to watch.",Blow Out

He has a particular skillset of blending shots/scenes without dissolves that carries the movie in an interesting cinematographic manner. Using shadows, silhouettes, rotating camera shots he is truly a master of this art-form.The story goes that Jack Terry (played by John Travolta) is a soundman for a B-movie studio. One night as he is out recording sounds for a film he sees an accident - a car swerves through a guard rail and into a river. Jack jumps in to help and sees that the driver is dead, but he manages to save the passenger. He soon finds out that the driver was the current favourite in the presidential election and after listening to the recording he suspects that what happened was no accident.'Blow Out' is supremely engaging and has a beautiful soundtrack/background score.

58,Movie-ManDan,The Best Thriller Since Alfred Hitchcock!,10,4 January 2015,"Alfred Hitchcock is the best director to ever do mysteries and thrillers. Although his shoes will never be filled, Brian De Palma has come the closest with his most riveting movie that Hitchcock would love. De Palma does such a good job with this that Hitchcock may not even have done a better job if he had directed it, and this actually beats some Hitchcock classics! I know most people will disagree with this last statement, but it is just my opinion.In one of John Travolta's best roles, (and the one with his best hairdo) he portrays electronics expert, Jack Terry, who earns a living making sound effects for low-budget horror movies. One night out collecting wind sounds, he witnesses a car careen into a creek. He saves the girl (Nancy Allen) and sees the driver has died. The driver was a presidential candidate. Jack listens again and realizes the tire was shot out. Trying to get to the bottom of everything, he is in store for a shocking political conspiracy, the girl's true identity and a psychotic madman on their trail.As De Palma's very own creation, he perfectly captures a dark atmosphere that fits the genre. Like a Hitchcock movie, there are many twists around a complex, yet easy to follow storyline. All twists are shocking, yet all play perfectly. When all the twists finish and the movie becomes a straight thriller, the excitement grows like never before with more danger on the line that can be swallowed. Everything works to an extremely shocking end that will feel like a major hit in the viewer's stomach.Everything about Blow-Out is so exciting and original.

Yes, of course, De Palma pays homage to both, ""Blow Up"" and ""Conversation"" but ""Blow Out"" is a vintage DePalma at his best, in his glory and brilliance. The story is great, packed with twists and turns and also lets us peek once again as in Body Double"" at the B-movies making process. John Travolta is Jack Terri, a sound technician who rescues a girl (Nancy Allen) from a car that crashes into a river after a blow out. The man who drove the car did not survive and he happened to be the next presidential candidate. Jack soon realizes that it was not just a blow out but a murder, and he's got an evidence to prove it, the tape that he made on the bridge while recording the background noises for the movie. As good as the story is, it does not forget its characters, and they are memorable and multi-dimensional. The actors are terrific. It was the time when John Travolta was both cute without being smug and compelling. Nancy Allen as Sally, was sweet and heartbreaking, Dennis Franz's character, Manny Karp, the petty blackmailer who got more than he bargained for was fun to watch, and John Lithgow made such a chilling villain that Anthony Hopkins could've learned something from him. I did not even start on Vilmos Zsigmond's camera work. Only one word comes to mind - mesmerizing. The final chase sequence on the streets of Philadelphia during the celebration of the ringing of the Liberty Bell is as well staged and shut and as exiting as the similar climatic chase on Mount Rushmore in Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"". The movie is perfectly balanced by the last scene and the hilarious opening scene mirroring each other but this time the scream is different.

60,RainDogJr,The Sound of the Truth,10,29 April 2008,"For my comment #150 here in IMDb, I have chosen Brian De Palma's ""Blow Out"", a less talked film of his career but at the same time, one of my favourites of him. Although I haven't watch yet Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Blowup"" I know that this film is a sort of a ""reinterpretation"", now using sounds instead of photos. Anyway, this film has Jack Terri (Travolta) as the main character; he works as the sound-man for a little film company that produces low-budget horror films. Working one night near a lake, looking out for some sounds, he is witness of a car accident that ends with the car inside the lake. Jack saves a girl that was inside the car, Sally (Nancy Allen), with a currently candidate for the presidency. Suddenly Jack will find the truth about that accident through his recorded tapes but also he will be witness of a conspiracy that nobody wants to hear about it.I love how this film start with a rare sequence of a horror film that ends with a funny scream, just to see the type of bad films in which Jack works. But although he failed in his job with the police and now works only for bad films, his abilities as a sound technician are really great. Soon as he gets involved with the car accident, there is going to be just mystery first with the possible fact that the candidate was with a prostitute and later with an entire murder conspiracy. Even the film involves a politic factor, l love how it focuses into Jack's obsession for finding the truth because, finally, there are many cases like that but now the witness is a citizen tired of the same endless stories that eventually will be forgotten. The other main character, Sally, is the opposite of Jack, always wanted to stay out of the conspiracy and maybe having too confidence to other people not seeing their real intentions. Eventually Jack will be the person who shows to her how things are really but also who puts her closer to the conspiracy and closer to her end. The conclusion is brilliant but of course not satisfactory for any of characters, maybe just for the director of the horror film, leaving a question for Jack that will stay in his mind: it was worth to look for justice?Cast: John Travolta here is great, of course this is not going to be mention as his roles in ""Grease"" and ""Saturday Night Fever"" but definitely is one of his bests performances. Nancy Allen is also pretty good just like the support cast.Conclusion: ""Blow Out"" is a great story about obsession and paranoia with an exciting climax and a brilliant end. De Palma's direction is great, with many unique sequences, and his script too, finding in the sound a great way to explore how the things really happened. Definitely this film is in my personal favourites of De Palma. 9.5 out of 10",Blow Out
61,raulfaust,End of the line,4,19 January 2014,"You know, this isn't my first time trying to enjoy a Brian De Palma movie. Taking a look at my reviews, I saw other three films he has made, and the only one I actually liked was 1980's ""Dressed to Kill""-- despite that one isn't flawless at all. I don't know what happens, but his movies always have infinite conspiracies that come from nowhere. There is always someone stalking someone, a dead person and a skeptical sheriff, and, in ""Blow Out""'s case, it's no different; the main character tries to find out what happened in the car accident thing, even if nobody else really cares about it. If you're interested in politicians conspiracies, I suggest you 1983's ""The Dead Zone"" and 2008's ""Nothing But The Truth"", which aren't perfect movies, but much better developed than ""Blow Out"". I believe that Brian De Palma's problem is the way he writers his movies. Instead of inventing lots of characters, situations and possibilities, he should make more simple stories, in order to not turn them into confusing puzzles with an over- the-top outcome, which IS the case with this picture.

62,PredragReviews,Classic De Palma!,8,7 April 2016,"Brian De Palma is one helluva showman, and when he nails the material with as much nerve, bite and sensual flourish as he does with this paranoid thriller, the results are breathtaking. Nancy Allen is heartbreaking and unusually character-driven as the prostitute; John Lithgow is all menace and glowering evil as the madman. But John Travolta is a jolt to your senses as the emotional sound engineer: his character goes through a wild series of transformations, brought on by a paranoia that is more than justified, and the Kennedy-like murder that begins the movie in such a stylish way.Low budget movie sound-man Jack Terry (John Travolta) is in the right place at the wrong time - while out recording some nature sounds for a B slasher flick (in which DePalma seems to poke fun at some of his own earlier work), he catches the sounds of an auto accident. In an incident reminiscent of Chappaquiddick, a car driven by a presidential candidate suffers a tire blowout and careens off a nearby bridge. The candidate dies, but Terry manages to rescue his ""lady friend"", a party girl named Sally (Nancy Allen). Key to the story is his recording, which seems to contain a double-bang - perhaps the blowout preceded by a gunshot? Naturally the story leads Terry into a web of intrigue featuring slimy political operatives, corrupt cops, and nefarious CIA henchmen.However, even if you're not a Travolta fan, Blow Out is a great suspense/thriller. Definitely one of DePalma's best of the genre and generally much better than most of the insultingly bad big-budget junk that comes out of Hollywood these days.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Blow Out
63,Sandcooler,"Beautiful style, wobbly plot",6,31 October 2014,"Many consider ""Blow Out"" to be the highlight of Brian De Palma's career, but to be honest I was pretty underwhelmed. It starts of great though. De Palma gets to show of his amazing knack for style in a brilliant opening scene that provides a hilarious pastiche on the slasher genre. The faux-sleazy look, the clever winks at genre classics, the genuine suspense even though you know it's a movie-within-a-movie, it's genius at work. There are more of those beautiful stylistic touches spread throughout the movie (the fireworks during the climax would be an obvious example), but the plot is just contrived and the final act demands more than a little suspension of disbelief. And while John Travolta puts in a strong lead performance, obligatory damsel in distress Nancy Allen never really manages to make her character likable so you don't really care whether she lives or dies. That's why the obvious Hitchcock influence isn't as effective as it could have been, Hitchcock gave us characters we deeply cared about and then did awful things to them. Sally is no Marion Crane to say the least, making it more difficult to stay interested in her story. ""Blow Out"" looks fantastic, but doesn't go very far beyond that.",Blow Out
64,lewiskendell,An early 80's thriller that's still worth seeing today.,7,18 September 2011,"Blow Out is a pretty decent thriller from the early 80's staring John Travolta. Travolta plays a movie sound effects technician who accidentally records the assassination of a governor, and has to expose the truth while protecting himself and another witness from the people who don't want the conspiracy uncovered. The best parts of the movie were some pretty cool camera angles, a nice sense of tension - courtesy of writer and director Brian De Palma, and a chilling performance from John Lithgow as a disturbed killer. If you were surprised by his murderous turn as a serial killer on the TV show Dexter a few years ago, this movie will show you that he's been good at playing that kind of a character for quite a while. Fans of De Palma, conspiracy films, or John Travolta would be doing themselves a favor by checking this out.",Blow Out
65,Sergeant_Tibbs,Gripping. Peak of De Palma's career.,8,7 September 2014,"Since its Criterion celebration, Blow Out has slowly been gaining momentum into growing out of its cult classic status to just a plain classic. It's easy to make comparisons to Blow Up and The Conversation, but it justifies itself as one worth doing. I wouldn't mind if we had one for every decade. Those films are slow and brooding, and masterpieces for it, but Blow Out is much more bombastic in its approach. It goes at a whiplash pace and intensity with vibrant pulpy cinematography and sharp editing with interesting instances of split screen. Naturally the sound design is terrific, filled with layers upon layers of soundtracks filling the space. I just love movies about filmmaking and this goes into the fascinating old nitty gritty methods in detail. Instantly won me over for that alone. It's easily John Travolta's best performance outside of Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction with a determined and ragged character and John Lithgow's sinister villain matches him. Nancy Allen drags it down a little by being unnecessarily irritating and out of sync with the rest of the cast, and the film suffers clichéd 80s moments where its score becomes overzealous and unwelcome. Otherwise Blow Out is a gripping thriller and certainly the highpoint of Brian De Palma's career.8/10",Blow Out

67,seymourblack-1,"Conspiracies, Cover-ups & Dark Humour",9,12 August 2014,"When the version of an event that's reported in the media loses credibility for any reason, cynicism, distrust and conspiracy theories are bound to follow and it's within this climate that political paranoia grows. In ""Blow Out"", after the death of a prominent politician in a car crash, certain important facts are intentionally withheld from the media, ostensibly to protect the man's family from any unnecessary embarrassment. The problem is that, in doing this, suspicion grows that there are far more sinister reasons why those involved have an interest in suppressing the truth. One of the strengths of this movie is the way in which the disturbing atmosphere that's created by these types of practices, gradually grows and then affects the perception of everything else that happens as the plot develops.Jack Terry (John Trevolta) is a sound technician who works for a company that produces low-budget horror movies. One night when he's out recording ambient sounds, he witnesses a car crash in which a vehicle veers off a bridge and falls into the river below. He swiftly leaps into the water and bravely rescues a young lady from the wreckage but is unable to help the driver who has already drowned. At the local hospital, where he and Sally Bedina (Nancy Allen) are treated, Jack is told that the man in the car was actually a leading Presidential candidate and he should forget about Sally's presence in the car for the benefit of everyone involved.Soon after, Jack sees a TV news report about a photographer called Manny Karp (Dennis Franz) who was also at the scene of the ""accident"" and took a series of photographs that are subsequently reproduced in a popular magazine. When Jack synchronises his sound recordings with the series of photos to produce a mini-movie of the event, he becomes convinced that a gunshot was fired immediately before a tyre blew out and the crash was the result of an assassination rather than a simple accident.Jack and Sally grow closer and she helps him in his efforts to prove that the crash wasn't an accident. The chances of Jack being successful are remote, however, because no-one believes his theory and there is little that one man can do to counteract the enormous power of the authorities that are involved in the cover-up.John Trevolta is perfect as a good natured and sympathetic man who's also very intense and obsessive. His character is talented and slumming in his current job because he's consumed with guilt about an incident that happened when he was working for the police when an agent that he'd wired was killed. It's ironic, especially in view of his relationship with Sally, that at one point, he wires her for sound in a way that's reminiscent of the incident that had haunted him so badly over the years.Sally's a hooker who'd worked extensively with Karp in the past to photograph men in compromising situations in order to blackmail them and Nancy Allen is good at conveying Sally's strange contradictions and complexities so convincingly. John Lithgow also impresses as a ruthless serial killer who's part of the conspiracy and has no compunction about killing innocent women simply to conceal his real motive for killing his prime targets.Brian De Palma is a sensational director in every sense of the word and ""Blow Out"" features the split screens, tilted camera angles and overhead shots that are typical of his work as well as the more voyeuristic, exploitative and darkly humorous moments that he also favours so strongly. The ways in which the circumstances of the accident and the cover-up immediately evoke thoughts of Chappaquiddick and Watergate are very effective in generating audience suspicion whilst also dispensing with the need for any unnecessary exposition and the movie's downbeat ending is also mitigated to some extent by the distasteful but amusing way in which Jack gets the perfect scream he needs for his current production.",Blow Out
68,hnt_dnl,Retrospect is a son of a gun!,9,15 April 2010,"Brian DePalma is actually one of my favorite directors! Interesting thing is that for quite of a few of the films of his that I had the privilege of seeing when they first came out that I loved immediately (The Untouchables, Carlito's Way, Mission Impossible), I hadn't really realized he directed them at the time that I first saw them. And I think was a good thing! Being very young at the time, I didn't know or care about the craft of directing and just watched movies for pure enjoyment. BLOW OUT (1981) came out when I was very young and certainly isn't the type of movie that I would have been interested in at the time anyway. But this may be DePalma's most mature film! DePalma is famously known for ""borrowing"" from Hitchcock in his films and Blow Out is perhaps a supreme example of that as much of the plot combines elements of both revered films Blow Up and The Conversation. But this film feels more original, even with the homage, than some of DePalma's other early 80s tips of the hat to Hitchcock, which either did an admirable job paying homage but still seemed derivative (Dressed to Kill) or copied so heavily that it devolved into parody (Body Double). Blow Out is more even toned, well paced, and treats the viewer with respect.Blow Out stars iconic John Travolta in what very well could be his true BEST film performance! There is not a single false note in Travolta's performance the whole way through the film, which itself has flaws. I use ""retrospect"" in my title b/c if anything, Travolta gives an Oscar-caliber performance in BLOW OUT, maybe even more so than in his actual nominated roles in Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction. Travolta's Jack Terry is truly ""authentic"", a real person, not some over-the-top character designed to win an Oscar, which is exactly why this is a true Oscar type performance...It is true and real! Not as good as Travolta, but still effective is Nancy Allen as a dimwitted prostitute, whose character actually grows on you as the film progresses due to how actually ""innocent"" she is in all of this. But she skewers a fine line at times of being a classic ""Hitchcock"" heroine and the obligatory sexy female in an early 80s movie!Much closer to being as good as Travolta is John Lithgow, who is truly scary as the ""villain"" of the piece Burke, who goes to the absolute extreme to discredit his candidate's competition, but we never really get a complete handle on his character. What's interesting is that even though it is technically a conspiracy, Burke is really operating alone in the murder aspect of the plot so he seems like a separate entity from his political bosses, who had no idea how crazy he was. So his part of the film has ties to Psycho. The conspiracy part itself is strangely downplayed throughout the film and appears to be the biggest MacGuffin ever, as the end of the movie shows how futile Jack's attempts at getting to the truth really were. It's one of the most truly tragic endings I've ever seen in a film.Blow Out is very interesting as it has a lot of mystery and ambiguity throughout even with knowing that there is actually a conspiracy and political intrigue. It's never clear who is pulling the strings and it seems like everyone is on board with hiding things (the hospital, the cops, the press) EXCEPT for Jack Terry! And Jack's personal motivation for nailing the conspirators borders on obsession and selfishness at times more so than for doing it because it is right, which is part of what makes the film fascinating. Even more so than most of Hitchcock's most acclaimed works, Blow Out has a cynicism and pessimism in characters and society that is unmatched. It's definitely one of the most unconventional films of the 80s and in the thriller genre itself.",Blow Out

70,rockman182,Blow Out (1981),7,14 August 2017,"I love Brian De Palma and have been meaning to watch this film for a long time. Body Double is probably my favorite De Palma of all time but really all of his films are just so special. Here we get a young John Travolta, Nancy Allen, and a murderous John Lithgow. The billing is already great, you just need De Palma to do a De Palma and really make this film special. The film was very good. It's not my favorite from De Palma but is definitely top five from what I've seen.The film is about a sound effects technician (very good at what he does) who is looking to get authentic sounds for sleazy horror movies that he works on. One night while outdoors he witnesses a car accident. In turn he meets a beautiful woman, who he soon falls for. It turns out that the car accident was actually staged and the conspiracy involved runs deep. The pair get mixed up in a political cover-up that becomes murderous. What we get is a wonderfully crafted noir thriller that is really purely entertaining.The film is reminiscent of other things De Palma. We get a voyeuristic tendency (one that can be seen in both Dressed to Kill and Body Double). There's a giant conspiracy where all is not what it seems with twists and turns, much like the aforementioned Body Double and the Fury. The film features De Palma's love for tracking shots and his complexly set up scenes for kills. And to top it all off; a heart wrenching beautiful score to go along with it. The film is smartly acted and is thrilling, despite being influenced by other films. I thought of The Conversation throughout large portions of the film. Also, like many other films there is a strong Hitchcock influence.Wonderful story telling, strongly acted characters, menacing villains, and gorgeous shots and sound design. It's De Palma at his peak. I wouldn't be surprised if this ranks a top of many people's De Palma list. I still like Body Double the best but if you are a De Palma fan then this is really a must see.

71,KnightsofNi11,Awesome conspiracy film,8,6 July 2012,"Car crashes, murder, political conspiracy, and filmmaking are what go into Brian De Palma's thrilling crime drama Blow Out. John Travolta stars as Jack Terry, a sound editor for a film production company. One night he is out recording sound and witnesses and records a car crash. But his involvement in the crash gets him into a lot more trouble than he ever could have bargained for as Jack finds himself in the middle of a huge government cover up, a cover up that he is one of the loose ends to. The film is thrilling, captivating, and John Travolta does a fantastic job in this leading role.If you're into conspiracy films then Blow Out is the film for you. It's got all the elements you could ever want in a cover up film. You've got multiple parties involved, each willing to employ violence to get what they need. There's a hefty dose of thrills and suspenseful tension throughout the film that keep it very exciting and very watchable. Then you have your protagonist who is stuck in the middle of it all just because he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. The story plays out from the perfect perspective where we only know as much as Jack, and we want to know what is going on just as badly as he does. It's superb storytelling and makes for a very enticing film from start to finish.But what really sets Blow Out apart is the context in which the story is set. Jack Terry is a sound editor and everything he does to figure out what kind of danger he is in involves sound and sound editing. It adds a layer of experimental intrigue to the film, as the sound is mixed very uniquely and De Palma does very interesting things with sound all throughout the film. Certain things are louder than others. Certain sounds are altered for one reason or another. It's all very unique and it makes Blow Out all the more fascinating to watch.Overall, Blow Out isn't a film that will blow you away(no pun intended), and the conspiracy storyline doesn't pay off quite how you would like it to, but the whole story is very well constructed and it's certainly a dense plot that is plenty intriguing. Blow Out is no groundbreaking film but it's incredibly well made and well worth the watch. It's an excellent film that shouldn't be missed.",Blow Out
72,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Great thriller,9,13 July 2006,"Jack Terri is a soundman for a B-movie studio. One night as he is out recording sounds for a film he sees an accident - a car swerves through a guard rail and into a river. Jack jumps in in effort to help and sees that the driver is dead, but he manages to save the passenger. He soon finds out that the driver was the current favorite in the presidential election and after listening to the recording he suspects that what happened was no accident.This is the type of movie many people call a rip-off as not only does it take an idea from a previous story and film ('Blow Up') it is one of DePalma's many Hitchcockian efforts. However, under his direction the film feels fresh and moves very well. It is 13 years before John Travolta made 'Pulp Fiction' but he was already a good lead actor. Dennis Franz also gives a good turn as a photographer who knows more than he is telling.However, the scene stealer, would have to be John Lithgow who stoically walks his way through the film as a ruthless killer who wants to remove Jack Terri for the evidence he has. Rarely is such a emotionless and callous role played out so well to such great effect.Then there is DePalma's direction which is the great thing that put all the good stuff together. He has a particular skill of blending shots/scenes without dissolves and that carries the movie is an interesting way. Using shadows, silhouettes, rotating camera shots he is truly a master in good form here. 9/10Rated R: some grisly violence, and profanity",Blow Out
73,Maziun,Quite possibly de Palma's best thriller,8,20 June 2014,"The idea of a man discovering a crime by listening to a recording is a reinterpretation of Michelangelo Antonioni's film ""Blow out"" (1966), but using sound instead of photographs. It might also have been inspired by Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" .This movie also alludes to the Watergate scandal and the JFK assassination.The story is quite straight forward and doesn't contain too many twists. It does however has thrilling moments (every time that John Lithgow is on the screen) and good visual style that Brian de Palma is known for. The best thing in the movie is the finale which is very memorable.John Travolta(""Grease"") suffered from insomnia during the shoot. His lack of sleep helped him create a very moody performance and this is why his character seems so downtrodden throughout the movie. This is his best performance until ""Pulp fiction"". Travolta is burned out, cynical , sad man who desperately seeks the truth. Nancy Allen (""Robocop"") is kinda annoying , too squeaky , but overall she is OK. Her character is a stereotypical dumb blonde , but with some soul and troubled past. John Lithgow (""Terms of endearment"") is quite creepy as the killer. Dennis Franz (""Die hard 2"") is on-form as a sleazy opportunist.I like how the movie makes fun of the slasher movies. There is a another benefit to this film - it gives a nostalgic and endearing glimpse into the analogue audio and film tape editing era . I really like Pino Donaggio's score and the camera work by Vilmos Zsigmond . The movie feels more style than substance , but it does have some psychological moments. The murder in the train station is one of the most horrific scenes I have ever experienced in a movie. The big slow motion scene with Travolta on the stairs is quite moving. The ending stays with you. It's a well made movie. It's both a conspiracy thriller and a melodrama. I give it 8/10.",Blow Out

John Travolta plays the role very well, while Nancy Allen was only mediocre in the female lead. Litghow and Franz were good in supporting roles, while DePalma's screenplay was pretty good, but i hated how a lot of directorial creativity was not there and there were a lot of hitchcock impressions in my opinion. This is where i fault both DePalma and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond (i although i presume that its more depalmas fault and zsigmond's other pictures don't contain this much unoriginality as far as his angles and filming), also the musical score was only decent from Pino Donaggio, again too similar to hitchcock classics in my eyes. Although DePalma has done some great work (Carlito's Way and Untouchables), a lot of his thrillers lack orginality as far as I'm concerned. Still a good entertaining film though. ---IMDB rating: 7.0, my rating: 8/10",Blow Out

80,avik-basu1889,Arguably De Palma's best film !!!,8,2 August 2016,"Based on all the Brian De Palma films I have seen as of now, I have no problem is stating that 'Blow Out' is my absolute favorite among them. De Palma's technical prowess has never been in doubt and it is again on show in this tightly paced conspiracy thriller, but he also adds layers to the screenplay through his visual choices and the protagonist Jack Terry played by John Travolta has the kind of depth and humanity that I couldn't find in some of his other films.While talking about the themes of the film, one has to make a comparative analysis because the nature of the film lends itself to such an approach. The connection to Antonioni's 'Blow Up' is unmissable if someone watches both the films. Both films are about a person unearthing a truth through their technical expertise, a truth that could somewhat go unnoticed by a layman. However De Palma is in no way trying to bring in an element of abstract existentialism that is a big part of 'Blow Up'. I think 'Blow Out' is also influenced by Hitchcock's 'Vertigo'. De Palma uses the colours of Red, White and Blue in a very meaningful and thematically poignant way just like Hitchcock did with the colours red and green in 'Vertigo'. As a matter of fact the shot of Manny's apartment room engulfed by the red neon light was very reminiscent of Judy's apartment in 'Vertigo' which had the green neon light coming in from outside. 'Blow Out' also shares with 'Vertigo' the Orpheus-esque theme of a character hurt by something in the past intentionally going through a similar incident again which breaks him permanently. 'Blow Out' can be compared with Coppola's 'The Conversation'(which was also tangentially influenced by 'Blow Up') because both films involve a character whose past trauma has led them to resort to something else for spiritual respite. For Jack Terry in 'Blow Out' it is the B- movie industry, while for Harry Caul in 'The Conversation', it is religion. However Jack isn't as psychologically broken and introverted as Harry was.Apart from everything that I mentioned, one can't forget that this is a political conspiracy film. The film was made at a time when USA was ready to move on after enduring the traumatic incidents that marked the 70s like Vietnam and Watergate by electing Ronald Reagan. De Palma at a political climate like this coming out with a film of this sort, must have tried to claim that this is nothing but a false sunrise and in the end, the film and the political deviousness that is depicted in 'Blow Out' turned out to be prescient. I think 'Blow Out' is also a bit of a love letter to all the grind-house sleazy exploitation films of the 1970s. The film opens with a scene which makes fun of these kind of films including De Palma's own films which did at times go overboard with the sleaziness. But over the course of the film and especially with the beautiful ending De Palma conveys that no matter how technically inept and thematically vapid these exploitation films may be, they still will always carry the filmmakers' blood, sweat and tears. There will still be something personal in these films too.The screenplay for the most part works. But there are a few sloppy elements here and there like exposition through television news reels and I also thought the climactic set-piece of the film gets a little too overblown. However the mild shortcomings of the screenplay get completely outweighed by De Palma's technical mastery. We get split screens, split diopter shots, tracking shots,etc. like all other De Palma films. There is a particular scene where De Palma uses the 360 degree shot and the camera revolves in a circular motion over and over again and it brilliantly expresses the paranoia of Jack in the scene.This might be Travolta's best role of his career. He is brilliant with the nuance as well as the gradual sense of paranoia that engulfs him. He fully realises the character and endures the psychological journey that the character of Jack goes through in a convincing way. Nancy Allen is very sweet and likable as Sally, although it can be said that at times, the character becomes a bit too dumb. John Lithgow is also brilliant as the psychotic Burke.I will end this review by saying that although I made a very thematic analysis of the film, simultaneously I also have to drive home the fact that 'Blow Out' is not just a thematically poignant, but also a very entertaining and funny film. It has something for everyone. Highly recommended.",Blow Out

Director: Brian De Palma
Watched: 9/21/18
Rating: 8/10Wed ""Taxi Driver"" + ""The Conversation"", and you have ""Blow Out"". Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Brian De Palma, respectively. Vonia's verdict? Coppola's is the best, followed by De Palma's, and finally Scorses's. They are all great films, of course. But don't take my word for it All the films are must sees.Creative camera work (although sometimes distracting split screen and 360 degree shots), a clever red, white, & blue color scheme, spectacular score, impressive performances by John Travolta and supporting John Lithgow. Travolta especially has enough alone time on screen that he must craft his nuanced emotions and convey meaning with little to work with other than his face. He pulls this off masterfully. Like the aforementioned films, limited dialogue in a film about a male loner that has a unique mind of his own. A little mad like Travis but also a genius in the sound and surveillance market like Harry. I will say, however, that it was a subtle suspense rather than a thriller. A few superfluous scenes and some poor holes, but comparatively minor complaints.Then again, I confess some partiality. Why? Filmed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Oh, the fond memories I have there. Recognizing almost all filming locations is always a delight. Blame it on the tender, nostalgic emotions that cloud my more critical tendencies. 30th Street Station (Oh, the hours I have spent in there, meandering, waiting for train, reading, eating pretzels!) Almost surreal chase through Center City. (He zooms straight through Penn State, where I had one of my first real photo shoots with the life size game pieces!) Market Street. Carpenter's Historic Hall. William Penn presiding over City Hall. Penn's Landing. South Street (Bridal stores here, but in my head: late night oversized greasy Lorenzo and Sons Pizza, some great Jim's Steaks cheesesteaks, Rita's Water Ice, South Street Diner, Wawa, CVS, Eyes Gallery! I could go on!) (Dangerous rendezvous!) Apollo Theater. Chestnut Place. (I used to have doctor's appointments there!) Murals all over town. (Especially Arch Street, where Jack's apartment is located) Market Street & 11th. (Burke targets the lookalike victim here with his strangling cord, I used to take the SEPTA from here so the time!) Moshulu. (Had a decadent and scenic dinner there, or should I say in there, on there?) Independence Seaport Museum. (Great museum, met artist Heidi Kenney outside on those steps during an art fair, now remembered as where Sally's murder takes place!) Independence Hall (Ambulance washer up!) Wanamaker's (Now Macy's, at least last I knew) Reading Terminal Market. (Always changing vendors, but probably as fun and delicious as ever!)Positive biases aside, this was a superb film; an engaging story that is also intelligent and relevant. De Palma references fellow directors, other films, even real life events. It explores the fascinating world of working in sound recording; Travolta plays an adept audio technician that inadvertently uncovers a crime. The victim a politician, conspiracy theories are not far behind. Artful and stylish, there is a tendency to focus on foley sounds or background score rather than dialogue. Fitting, since any good sound man needs to listen more than he talks. A spectacular example of showing rather than telling the story.Add a serial killer that utilizes a phone booth, prostitutes, incriminating photographs, dubious motel rooms, dark alleys, train stations- and you have something not quite film noir, but has all the best aspects of one.#FilmReview #Conspiracy #CompellingChase #Detective #FoleyArtist #MurderMystery #Philadelphia #PhoneBooth #Photography #Political #Prostitution #ReconstructingTruth #SerialKiller #SurprisingSubcultures #Suspense #Surveillance",Blow Out

But how do you tie it all together? How do you come up with an ending? Well as to the first question, I can only hope it was studio interference that prescribed the John Lithgow psycho, who is as engaging and complex as a sheet of drywall and who totally pounds at the ""one bad apple"" theory, so you ain't here for politics. And unfortunately, none of the other characters engage as characters either - Travolta's haunted sound-recordist gets more remote as the movie progresses, and you keep waiting for Nancy Allen to have a Kim Novak moment that never arrives. And speaking of Kim Novak, we have the ending. In order for De Palma to have his Vertigo angle (with history repeating itself in the death of a loved one) he has to reach out of the main narrative and impose two matching set pieces - external, extraneous, preposterous set pieces - on the second act and at the climax. I much prefer the tools-of-the-trade process intrigue as sound-guy Travolta pieces together a government cover-up through bits of media. The funny thing is, the process itself is also preposterous. Sure, the magazine published every frame of the home movie in sequence. Sure, he pulls the negative out of the camera WITH THE LIGHTS ON and then sends it to the lab. This, I grant you, may be deliberate head-games, an admonition to look somewhere else for the meaning. I'm not saying it didn't move along nicely, or that it didn't impressively fill the screen in 35mm. And while the denouement may be totally cheap, as such it's a bit shocking, and welcome for that.

85,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Suspense at it's finest.,9,8 May 2011,"I feel pretty safe in saying that paranoia thrillers are my favorite breed of film. I also feel safe in saying that there when it comes to great entries into this subgenre, I can count them on two hands. The Conversation, Marathon Man, The American, etc. And Blow Out is now a worthy addition to this elite group. The whole thing jumps with suspense, keeping you on the edge and driving you more and more into a state of obsession, desperate to see our main character prevail.I never though John Travolta could deliver a solid performance, but he is magnetic here. Apparently he didn't really sleep during the shooting of the film and it pays off extremely well when it comes to his portrayal, getting progressively more desolate as the film goes on. He keeps trying to do the right thing, save himself and get the truth out, but everything seems to be battling against him. It's a constant struggle for decency in a world where the corrupt profit and the bad guys get away, and Travolta's anguish just gets more impressive until the final frame. In those last few scenes he shows an emotional strength unlike anything I ever thought he was capable of. I really wish we could have seen more of this actor throughout his career, because this actor is sensational. His last few scenes, torn apart by the guilt, punishing himself for blood that he feels is on his hands, are absolutely gut-wrenching.Brian De Palma is never a director I've been too fond of, but he takes everything to a whole new level here. Everything is staged so brilliantly. The visuals are insane, shots and edits unlike anything that came before it, and there are some scenes that are so epic I could hardly breathe. Travolta running through the crowd in slow motion with his earpiece in and the fireworks blasting in the background; absolutely beautiful, breathtaking, simultaneously heart-racing and heart-stopping. That is how you create a scene a climax. The entire film is really brilliantly put together, scenes of intrigue and intelligence mixed very well with remarkably frightening, suspenseful stuff when John Lithgow's character comes on screen (the train station, good lord).It's a film like very few others, taking us into all of my favorite worlds. Political corruption, an unseen organization behind violent crimes, a protagonist completely out of his element, falling deeper and deeper into obsession and desperation. The film features two men who I thought would never be able to pull anything great off and they both surprise me by combining for one of the most brilliant pictures of it's decade. It's intense, fascinating and, in the end, absolutely devastating.",Blow Out
86,jayjaycee,"Excellently crafted political thriller, only tainted by its illogical ending",8,26 November 2020,"""Blow Out"" is a 1981 crime thriller directed by Brian De Palma starring John Travolta and Nancy Allen.
⚪
All in all, this collaboration of three ""Carrie"" alumni grippingly depicts an intensely and extremely shrewdly constructed conspiracy, that due to solid central performances, well-developed pacing and a clever screenplay that knows to play with sounds and gradually give away its shocking details, manages to become a decently atmospheric and unexpectedly twisted political thriller that, even if it at times loses much steam and evinces utterly illogical behaviour in its final act, hits as precisely as a shot hits a tire most of the time, and thus becomes a flawed yet intense genre entry.
⚪
I first became aware of this film when I scrolled through the filmography of Brian De Palma after having watched the marvellous Stephen King adaptation ""Carrie"" again, and my curiosity made me wonder what the director has done aside from it. Of course, his opus magnum ""Scarface"" is extremely popular to this day and probably my favourite film of him, but I wanted to see the lesser known titles as well. Hence, I stumbled across this early eighties production that made me extremely curious for its cast only: Next to ""Grease"" superstar John Travolta (who by know has even become one of my favourite artists), there is John Lithgow and future ""RoboCop"" lead actress Nancy Allen. It didn't take me long to realize how the film is in fact a production of three former ""Carrie"" collaborators, since Travolta and Allen played the antagonistic couple in the De Palma directed feature. After I was able to track it down for a reasonable price, I had to give it a watch, and as I expected it no differently, I was pleased with the outcome. This time around, Billy Nolan and Chris Hargenson don't play vicious tricks on a shy outsider, this time they are the good guys who are unwittingly caught up in a hideous conspiracy. During a time were sound effects were improved and added to the picture analogically, Travolta charismatically plays Jack Terry, an ambitious sound effects artists who by pure coincidence, records an assassination when he tries to capture new wind sounds for the trashy slasher he is working on. Even if the idea of the plot might not sound that stunning, it is the development that makes it the unnerving political thriller it is. After the press wrote off the events as a freaky accident, Terry tries to prove the truth he has seen, because the man who was killed was no other than the presidential candidate on a ride with his mistress Sally, a young make-up artist (lively portrayed by Allen), but since the victim's management don't want to cause a scandal and damage the deceased's reputation, nobody wants to listen to him. What makes this plot development so superb is how the viewer gradually learns that more people were present when the incident took place, and that there is more to the case than initially assumed. Next to Sally's partner Manny Karp who waited at the bridge to take damned photos of the governor in order to blackmail him, there was also the assassin Burke (threateningly portrayed by Lithgow). Each and everyone pursue their own objective, and from professional pride to greed for money, there is everything. The reason why this movie becomes increasingly more intense and threatening is De Palma's meticulous direction, because next to the fascinatingly tight camera work, he, ironically, toys a lot with sound effects and background noises. Painstakingly, he uses those practical features to underline the subtle intensity of his work, and I can tell you, it is extremely effective. However, there is still one major flaw in this film that taints the experience in a slight but nevertheless significant manner. The whole paranoia aspect might be elaborated and included in the behaviour of the characters (even though it isn't quite on a ""Marathon Man"" level), but strangely enough, it hasn't gone through with ti consequently. Both of the protagonists are aware that a killer walks abroad, brutal murderer who kills women that look like Sally, so their actions are questionably dumb in the end. When Terry is directly approached by the news anchor who wants him to show the world what has really happened in the fateful night, he remains cautious but notices that he is no danger, but when Sally tells him that said journalist, who is presented to be intrusive, wants to meet her at a remote location to obtain the recordings and interview her, he just goes along with it? Like, shouldn't it be even more alarming when she mentions that he called her just like that without even knowing her phone number? In general, it is no big deal, but this plot convenience affects the final act enormously and makes it unnecessary absurd and painfully unrealistic. It is even more paradoxical when he allows his female companion to meet this guy at the strange location without accompanying him. Instead, he wires her and tries tracks her down for the last sequence. Ultimately, his undertaking fails miserably, because even if the can stop Burke from doing more harm to people, Sally was already killed and the tragedy perfect. The whole final act was utterly illogical and made no sense at all, because nobody profits from it. The evidences are gone, his beloved is dead and nobody learns about the truth. What was the whole point of the operation? That's right, there was none. The characters that previously acted tremendously cautiously, ended up behaving inexplicably recklessly. You know what I mean? The only thing Terry gains from this catastrophe is that he finally got the perfect death scream for his movie. What an achievement! In the end, this film has all the ingredients to become a fine political thriller, but unlike other entries from the genre, it fails to keep the quality on continuously high level and loses so much steam in the ludicrous final act. It is undeniably enjoyable and well crafted most of the time, but the dumb ending taints the brilliance that preceded it tremendously.",Blow Out
87,mnpollio,A masterful thriller done in by a horrendous climax,6,1 June 2007,"Director Brian DePalma seemed well on his way to topping his successful Dressed to Kill with this expert political thriller, inspired by Antonioni's Blow-Up. Movie sound effects tech John Travolta is out recording and is on hand to witness a blow-out, which results in a deadly car accident that claims the life of the political personality in the driver's seat. Travolta is able to rescue the frantic female passenger (played by Nancy Allen). Upon subsequent review of his recordings, Travolta becomes convinced that the blow-out was in actuality a well-coordinated assassination attempt. His obsessive digging to get at the truth places both his life and Allen's life in danger. DePalma mixes themes of the Kennedy assassination, Chappaquiddick and Watergate-era paranoia into a cohesive and rather frightening whole. The rock-solid storyline and DePalma's stylish direction heighten the fear and dread of both the audience and the on-screen characters. DePalma re-teams Travolta and Allen from Carrie to play two completely different kinds of people. Travolta, struggling at the time to escape his teenybopper image, gives one of his best performances and is completely convincing and winning as the sound man. It is interesting to see Allen portray a role light years away from her Dressed to Kill character. Initially, one is a bit annoyed with DePalma for crafting such a character, who is a bit spacey and speaks in a strange Betty Boop-ish voice, but it ultimately works. Somehow, Allen crafts a winning character who manages to still seem innocent despite the sleazy characters that surround her and the situation in which she partakes. Fans of John Lithgow's comedic roles will be astounded to see his creepy portrayal of an amoral killer. So good is the film that it is almost palpably painful when DePalma shoots himself in the foot during the climax. So intent is DePalma on pulling a rabbit out of his hat and trying to provide anything of shock value that he compromises both the storyline and the lead characters in the concluding moments. While it is not unusual for political thrillers to end on down notes to intensify their message of a conspiracy, it usually comes as a natural development of what came before. DePalma so totally compromises his leads and his film in the final moments that cannot possibly believe the same director is responsible. In particular, no one would believe that the Travolta character as presented in the prior scenes of the film would conduct himself and make such a decision as what occurs in the fade-out moments. In short, DePalma provides a send-off that ultimately betrays the characters that have won audience support up to that moment and it is an inappropriate and fatuous choice that ends up irreparably marring a nearly brilliant film.",Blow Out

89,Emerenciano,Be ready!,8,22 April 2002,"This is another De Palma's striking movies full of suspense and action.

While he is there he sees (and register on a tape) an car following on a river after being hit by a shot. Once the press believes it was ""only"" an accident he decides to use the tapes to prove is was a murder. His job becomes a challenge when someone decides to stop him.The cast is really competent (I particularly like John Travolta's, John Lithgow's and Nancy Allen's performances) and the direction is charming - it makes us remember Hitchcock's style in the last breath-taking scene.

However, the dialogues are like roller-coaster some are excellent as the last line of the movie others are simply average and forgettable.

91,HenryHextonEsq,A studiously effective film.,7,16 April 2002,"You can tell De Palma is plying his neo-Hitchcockian trade here, but also evoking memories of ""Blow-Up"" (apparently, though I have not seen that film as of yet) and ""The Conversation"". I found this far from as great a picture as ""The Conversation"", but it was more than satisfactory on its own terms. From a very neat, clever opening to a frankly bizarre ending straight out of left-field (don't think I've quite seen such a bizarre moment and an odd change in tone), this is a fairly compelling ride through suspenseful thriller territory against a background of sound details and political conspiracies.Perhaps John Lithgow's character, while effective, should have been given a lot more screen time and dialogue. It is all slightly opaque; the motives of this man and the shadowy ""them"" are not delved into enough. The actors are all competent, it must be said, if not great. Travolta is very credible as this questionable if understandable director chap, a maker of trashy films, who is embroiled in a real-life drama somewhat out of his league. Nancy Allen, oddly enough, reminded me of Joanne Woodward in ""WUSA"", a film I watched yesterday; and indeed she is a similar character. The later, climactic scenes are very effective, with Allen indeed ominously and almost amusingly oblivious to her fate.Note should be made of stalwart efforts on the cinematography and musical sides, from respected types, Vilmos Zsigmond and Pino Donaggio (""Don't Look Now""). It is a well crafted, if far from original film; not the sort of film I can quite love, but to be respected all the same. Oh, and that ending is absolutely insane!Rating:- *** 1/2/*****",Blow Out
92,nesfilmreviews,"Badly dated, questions left unanswered, but a respectable watch.",7,30 May 2013,"Brian De Palma's stylistic suspense thriller ""Blow Out,"" is all about a young man's successful search for the perfect scream. Not just any old scream, but the full-bodied, deep-from-the-diaphragm scream of ultimate terror by young woman at the exact moment she understands her murder is at hand. Subtle references made by De Palma in ''Blow Out'' are not always specific, though it blatantly recalls Michelangelo Antonioni's ''Blow Up"" (1966), which was also about the chance witnessing of an event that may or may not have been a murder. Francis Coppola's classic ''The Conversation"" (1974), was also inspired by the Antonioni film. The plot of ''Blow Out'' also makes use of the sort of cover-up that could be Watergate-inspired. A young man, Jack Terri (John Travolta), is a sound technician who works on soft-core porn flicks in Philadelphia. He doesn't know what he's involved in during the entire runtime of ''Blow Out.'' He becomes sidetracked by what appears to be a conspiracy to cover up the murder of a politician in a car crash he accidentally witnesses and records. He falls in love with the young woman, Sally Bedina (Nancy Allen), who was in the car with the politician when he was killed. Curiosity gets the better of Jack when the media starts to cover up details of the story. Jack begins to unravel the pieces of a criminal conspiracy using his knowledge of the film industry, as he struggles to survive while being hunted down to expose the truth, and he doesn't know whom he can trust.The film has several subsidiary plots involving blackmail, the murder of innocent bystanders, and accusations of paranoia directed against Jack. The film's basic (and basically comic), concern is the perfect scream. '""Blow Out,'' which takes its title from the tire blowout that causes the automobile accident near the beginning of the film, is a virtually nonstop demonstration of style-as-content. The style is never as spectacular as in Mr. De Palma's ''The Fury"" (1978), but also it's never as absurd. Absorbing and intriguing for the most part, despite being badly dated. Travolta and Allen both deliver fine performances, but ultimately the film is weakened by substantial holes in logic. The film answers some such questions, and others continue to dangle and are never resolved. If you as the viewer insist the story to be completely plausible, you'll miss the real enjoyment of the film. You'll also miss the film's real point...which is that recording of the perfect scream.",Blow Out

There're some huge set pieces within which the characters play. It would be interesting to know how much the film cost to make.The focus on romance that usually inhabits many films, exists here as potential energy only. It acts a partial glue to keep two characters caring for each other.

94,grahamclarke,There's more to film making than style,7,29 August 2004,"De Palma does not deserve to be called a great film director, for the simple reason that in his long career he has not made a truly great film. What he does have is tremendous style, a rare commodity in film making. When Hitchcock made weak films, his inimitable style was often enough to make the experience worth while. This was forgivable since that style was used to create many cinematic masterpieces. Not so with De Palma. His mastery of the medium has little to show for it in terms of the final product.""Blow Out"" remains one of De Palma's most stylish efforts. Perhaps the real star of this film is cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond who provides a master class in the art of how to use a camera. To fully appreciate this, ""Blow Out"" should be seen ideally on a large cinema screen. Despite its many flaws, including a screenplay which doesn't hold up to close inspection, there's much to enjoy here. Paraphrasing Antonioni's ""Blow Up"", (though thankfully without the pretentiousness), ""Blow Out"" holds our attention thanks to De Palma's expert pacing and an endearing performance by John Travolta, at a point where his career had began to slide.""Blow Out"" operates on a number of levels. The basic narrative is possibly the weakest of these. Travolta's sound man clearly has a passion for his work which goes way beyond doing his job mirroring De Palma's passion for film making. The joy of watching ""Blow Out"" is this infectious passion at its core. It's not entirely surprising that Tarantino's has championed this film. It's a movie for people who love movies.

I was on the edge of my seat at all times. Every scene was important to the story and you really had to pay close attention to what was happening in each moment. A lot of the action scenes and stalking scenes with Burke were really intense, very well done.The acting was a very strong positive for Blow Out. Knowing of Nancy Allen and seeing her other roles, it was interesting to see her play something different. The character Sally is bubbly and ditzy and her voice is childlike almost. She did it well. John Travolta was his usual charming self, and he had great chemistry with Allen just as they did in 'Carrie'. Jon Lithgow was brilliant as well as the trained killer named Burke who was trying to snuff out Allen's character.Blow Out was a wonderful crime thriller!

98,shaun98,"Great Travola performance, mediocre script",6,5 November 2004,"Plot: John Travolta plays Jack, a motion picture soundman stuck in an unsatisfying career working on sleazy horror movies. While ""capturing"" sound on location, his career takes a bizarre turn when he unwittedly records what may be a political murder. His only ally is a dimwitted prostitute (Nancy Allen), his only clue with a shady private eye (Dennis Franz).Critique: Brian DePalma's films are a mixed bag. Sometimes he's quite good, other times he's just mediocre. This variance in quality can be found within individual films. For example, his ""Dressed to Kill"" had some genuinely suspenseful moments, but dragged at times. Likewise, ""Blow Out"" is an uneven film. The first half effectively sets things up, promising a masterful thriller (the send-off of slasher movies is a hoot). However, the second half tends to lag. The director's trademark style is evident here. He uses split screen, slow motion, and deep focus photography to craft some truly striking bits. Full use is made of the Panavision frame, so this movie cannot be appreciated in pan-and-scan. Unfortunately the pacing is off, and ""Blow Out"" never quite gathers steam, despite its virtues. I finished it thinking that it was interesting, but still could have been better.Travolta's magnetic performance anchors the film during its weaker moments--forget about his recent turkeys, this movie shows his true star power. His supporting players do not fare as well--Nancy Allen's character is too much of a ditz to generate much sympathy, and John Lithow, as the killer, just isn't interesting as a character (in part due to his limited dialouge). Dennis Franz is appropriately seedy, if one-dimensional, as the aforementioned private eye. In fact, the film tends to work best when focusing exclusively on Travola's character--it's always intriguing to see him use his skills to piece together the clues.In the end, I'd recommend ""Blow Out"" to three main camps: DePalma fans, Travolta fans, and fans of cult movies in general. While stylish, it's too dated and uneven to appeal to most mainstream viewers.Rating: 6/10 or (**1/2)Released by Filmways Pictures",Blow Out

I haven't yet seen Blowup so I can't compare this film to it's source material but I liked this film very much. The acting is all pretty mostly good and the story is incredible and very gripping espeacily near the end, and now that I'm on that topic I absolutely loved the sequence before the ending and the ending itself with Jack using Sally's scream in the horror film (even though it's a very weird thing to do even if he was obssessed with her dying scream). I also love the mean through wich the murder is discovered, it makes the film more interesting and since the protagonist is a sound technician working on a movie it's also a good way to show this lesser known but immensely important part of filmmaking. The film is also very well shot with really cool moments like when the camera is spinning around the room, the film is also filled with double diopter lens shots characteristic of De Palma.
Overall it's a great triller and one of the best works by the director. Obviously worth watching.

101,robb_772,Intense suspense - De Palma's best film,8,4 May 2006,"Possibly the best Hitchcock picture that Hitchcock never made, BLOW OUT is arguably Brian De Palma's best work, with only 1976's CARRIE even coming close. Taking inspiration from Antonioni's BLOW-UP (1966) and Coppola's THE CONVERSATION (1974), BLOW OUT is one of those rare, intelligent thrillers that isn't afraid to take it's time to reach it's payoff. This is a film where all of the elements come perfectly together, and De Palma manages to merge his infamous bag of set-pieces and camera tricks into a marvelously twisted thriller that seamlessly blends elements of political intrigue and homicide into an engrossing human story with fully-realized lead characters. An absolutely air-tight plot, this is definitely one that you have to play close attention to in order to completely appreciate the intricate screenplay.At the heart of the picture is John Travolta's great performance as the movie sound effects man who becomes swept up in the film's elaborate conspiracy. Over-worked and paranoid, Travolta's Jack is an everyman in the very best Hitchcockian tradition. In my opinion, it remains Travolta's best work. Nancy Allen (who was married to De Palma at the time) is often heavily criticized for her empty-headed, baby-voiced performance as Sally, the somewhat dim-witted hooker who is central to unlocking the mystery. While I will admit that her first two scenes are almost painfully awkward (though this was possibly intentional), her unabashed quirkiness eventually wins me over (at about the halfway mark) every time I see the picture. The impressively-demented John Lithgow and the appropriately slimy Denis Franz round out the ensemble, and they both perform flawlessly.Unfortunately, this griping, intelligent film was not a success with the movie-going public of the early eighties, who seemed to prefer the fun house-styled thrills of DRESSED TO KILL instead. Time has been good to BLOW OUT, however, and the picture is more highly regarded today than it ever has been. The film runs the gauntlet of moods and styles that De Palma's films are known for, only this time everything works. From the hilarious opening parody of the ridiculous Friday THE 13th-styled slasher movies, to one of the bleakest, most haunting and disturbing endings of all-time - the film never strikes a false chord. Nearly 25 years after it's original release, BLOW OUT remains a true motion picture rarity - a stylish thriller for adults!",Blow Out

Anyway, I have to say that ""Blow Out"" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It doesn't succeed in any way, and it pains me to say that because I wanted it to be good. I am always disappointed when I hear a movie hyped up only to have it let me down, and that was what this movie was in a nutshell to me -- a big letdown.It wasn't particularly suspenseful and the ending sucks. That's about the quickest review I can give of the movie. Stay away from this stinker!",Blow Out
103,stonedraim,Blow out of a movie.,8,12 June 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Wow. This movie is from 1981, and kicks off in a really scary and psychological way. You are in the seat of a murder going from window to window. The breathing from the killer is on edge and a dark thump is going through the screen in a rhythmic way... at the same time the sounds and music from the night life is breaking through. A couple is having sex, two girls are dancing, one girl is masturbating and there is movement in the hall way... and the breathing keeps on coming closer, just to end in a scene ripped off from the classic of ""Psycho"". Cut; to Jack Terry (John Travolta) sitting in a movie theater commenting what he just saw. Follows does the discussion between Jack and the movie director, talking about sound effects. And when the conclusion is made, cut to black background, wind is whining out with a wind shield wiper showing that this production is made by Brian De Palma. Solid performed and solid production to kick things forward. Being a movie from 1981, this is made with pure horror and fine production, starting this motion picture off like a silent rocket just waiting to explode. The bar is set high.... really high.It keeps on; about 7 minutes into this one there is class act camera production and class act camera angels squaring off into a divided screen showing news on one side, the movements of the sound editor Jack Terry working on new sound effects. I loooove this kind of movie magic. The first movie I knowingly and consciously saw by Brian De Palma was ""Snake Eyes"" with amongst others Nicholas Cage and Gary Sinise. Brian De Palmas way grabbed me and I have always looked forward seeing more movies from and by him. His cinematography and flicks of details is just jaw dropping. So, I dived into ""Blow out"" with high expectations.... no...as TOTO puts it on their album XIV from 2016; Great expectations.Even in this one Brian De Palma stays within a time frame and shows the events from different angles. It is very interesting how he and the production team has put together the accident and the events during night time several times here. ""Snake Eyes"" really comes to mind.Nice little touch of a recording and production detail; at one moment the sound is being recorded from outside (or so it should give the impression of). The visual is recorded through a window. The scene and lines is carried out indoor and the sound is from outside; just to cut and the sound is being up close with Sally (Nancy Allen) indoor. Brian De Palmas interest of movie productions is shining through in ""Blow Out"". Jack (Mr. Travolta) is making sound effects and also cuts out pictures in a magazine just to photograph them and make a little picture-to-picture type of clarification of the ""car accident"". Mr. De Palmas show off of in and out focus and in and out zoomings in the same cut and scene (see time 18:20) is top notch. He even delivers two twists in the end that both gives the movie a sad depth and also a clever twist for Jack to wrap his work up to. Well... do you like how different types of styles blend together speaking of sound- and movie production, and at the same time getting a full ""blow(n) out"" (pun intended...?) thriller, turn this 1981 classic on.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Magnificent! Astonishing! Visuals that is excellent, camera angles and recording at its peak, sound editing within the sound editing... I could go on and on. Considered this production is made 1981, its shining! - The actors : John Travolta and John Lithgow is almost spot on. Nancy Allen... either is she plain and simple bad or is Mr. De Palma playing around with her, 'cause her acting in this one is way off; her delivery of the lines, her accent of words and her awful facial expressions during... well, during all the time. - The story : A man recording a killing, and then dwells into a detectives work to put out the true story. In the alley, a dark killer is on a hunt. The political twist is that they hire an already known serial killer... really good story! - Entertainment : All the way through.... as written earlier; I love this kind of recording, screen writing, cinematography and production. - Age : 157,8 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)",Blow Out
104,jed-estes,What is this?,5,6 September 2006,"I have watched this several times and have not found a good reason for it to have been made. It says nothing and does nothing, it is like two hours of film that is without meaning. It felt as if Brian De Palma was at the end of his rope on this one. His work to this point had been great (The Phantom of the Paridise), bad (Sisters), and Ugly (Carrie). This is where he tries to step out of the horror rut he got into and he fails. That is probably why it took two years for him to collect himself and make a great film with 1983's Scarface. This film Blow Out can not decide what it wants to be. At first you think it will be horror because it's a Brian De Palma movie but then it turns into a sluggish drama, with Stayin Alive's John Travolta. I say Stayin Alive's John Travolta because this is on par with that and is a far, far cry from his Pulp Fiction future. Nancy Allen is given little to do in this except sit and look pretty. I wonder if this is when her problems with De Plama in their marriage started because it feels as if shes holding back in this film. Avoid this.",Blow Out
105,KatMiss,SMART AND SUSPENSEFUL,10,14 July 2001,"Brian DePalma's ""Blow Out"" is a smart and suspenseful thriller that is probably his most original. It owes more to Antonioni than to Hitchcock, especially the former's ""Blow Up"", which starred David Hemmings as a photographer who thinks he is a witness to a murder. ""Blow Out"" starts with that, but DePalma has his own agenda. He loads this film with so many nice surprises that he manages to surpass his previous work (which includes ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Sisters"" and ""Obsession"")The story this time:(WARNING:SPOILERS AHEAD, BUT NOT MANY)John Travolta plays Jack Terri, a soundman working on a Philly based B-movie. He is out recording night sounds when a ""blow out"" occurs and forces a car into the river. Jack dives in and saves the girl (Nancy Allen), but is unable to save the man. Looks like a normal accident, right? Well, the girl turns out to be a high paid call girl (This is Allen's third call girl in a row in a DePalma film, following ""Home Movies"" and ""Dressed to Kill""; no wonder the marriage didn't last)and the victim is a powerful Presidential candidate.
That's all I can describe without spoiling it for you. What I described is the first 15 minutes of a 108 minute labyrinth. ""Blow Out"" is less explicit and bloody than DePalma's previous film ""Dressed to Kill"", but it is more intelligent and dignified. The technical credits are absolutely tops. Vilmos Zsigmond's Panavision photography (which will be ruined on TV; the tape is cropped to show a 2.35:1 image in a 1.33:1 screen)has all sorts of nuances and surprises that you might not catch on initial viewings. A lot of this movie is dark, but Travolta's character is thrown into the dark side of Philly (and life, come to think of it),so the visual scheme is appropriate. Best of all is Pino Donnagio's score. As in ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Body Double"" and ""Carrie"", the music doesn't give away DePalma's surprises, but it creates additional suspense and mood, as all great scores do. This is the best work Donnagio has done on a film and he deserved an Oscar nomination.The performances are also exceptional. John Travolta is finally given a smart character to play, especially after the idiots Barbarino, Tony Manero and Squash (from ""Moment to Moment""). He gets to showcase his intelligence and his good looks simultaneously. It is a tight rope of emotions and Travolta pulls it off. Nancy Allen's hooker is not as smart as the one she played in ""Dressed to Kill"", but at least it is miles better than the glamorized Julia Roberts stereotype I'm used to seeing these days. In supporting roles, DePalma regulars John Lithgow and Dennis Franz do their usual good job as villains (Lithgow in ""Obsession"", Franz in ""The Fury"", ""Sisters"" and ""Dressed to Kill"")Blow Out is one of the best thrillers you'll see. Check it out. Right now.**** out of 4 stars",Blow Out
106,rcolgan,The Sound of Murder,8,10 July 2016,"Out of Brian De Palma's entire filmography, Blow Out could easily be his most overlooked. Similar to his other works he plays homage to other classic films (such as Blow Up) in his own stylistic direction, whilst also combining it with cynicism and concluding with one of the most tragically powerful moments of De Palma's entire career. Travolta stars as sound recording artist Jack Terry. He works on cheap exploitation movies and his time is mostly spent gathering sound effects like screams to dub over bad actresses. One night when he's collecting new sound recordings, a car tyre blows out nearby and sends it plunging in to a river. Travolta dives in and rescues a girl named Sally (Nancy Allen) but is unable to save the driver. Later Travolta discovers the driver was a presidential candidate and after reviewing the sound recording becomes convinced that he heard a gunshot before the blow out. As Travolta begins digging deeper a man named Burke (John Lithgow) emerges who's willing to do anything to cover up what happened, even if it means killing even more people to do it. He's a pure sociopath who never shows any remorse for his actions. Beyond this, many others (including the police) also seem to be covering up whatever happened. Travolta is even told after the accident not to tell anybody that the girl was in the car with him. Supposedly this is to prevent distress to his wife that her husband was in an affair, but Travolta can't be sure that there wasn't some ulterior motive to this cover up.Similarly to Francis Ford Coopla's The Conversation, it's this feeling of Paranoia that dominates the majority of Blow Out. It's an extremely pessimistic film that is still reeling from the conspiracies and cover ups that surrounded the likes of Watergate and the Kennedy assassination. These events seem to have shaped Travolta's character to be distrusting of almost everyone around him. Even when somebody does eventually offer to help him out, Travolta remains hesitant and convinced that they're in on it too. And for good reason, since he's never entirely certain of just how large this conspiracy is. De Palma really helps build this paranoia throughout the film through a very voyeuristic style. For example, in one recurring shot we see Travolta from the street looking up at him through a window. This feeling of being watched recurs throughout the entire film and it serves as a constant reminder of the unknown conspiracy that constantly consumes Travolta's life. De Palma also seems to take great pleasure throughout the film in giving us a look in to the filmmaking process. In the introduction of the film then after following a long take from one of the horror films that Travolta's working on (in a shot resembling the introduction of Halloween) we see how he isolates each individual sound and the attention to detail that's required to create even something like a cheap exploitation film. Then later when Travolta is reviewing the recording of the crash we see the lengths that he goes to so he can put together the audio in order to make a solid case to prove his theories. It's an effective attention to detail that really shows a great appreciation to the entire film-making process. Interestingly this film is also the reason that Tarantino cast Travolta in Pulp Fiction and Blow Out is definitely a key example of Travolta at his very best. Throughout Travolta seems so worn down and constantly on the verge, whilst also still successfully creating a very loving and natural chemistry with Nancy Allen. On top of this he really brings a real sense of tragedy to the films climax and really brings home just how grim this world can be.",Blow Out
107,susansweb,"Pretty disappointing for so-called rediscovered ""classic"".",2,22 January 2003,"Brian De Palma does it again with his versions of classic moments from other movies. In this one we have the 'homages' to ""Blow-Up"" and ""Rear Window"". Throw in a psychopath with an extended scene of him killing someone that does nothing to further the plot. Add a ridiculous car chase through a parade. Then top it off with a twist ending that comes off mean-spirited and sleazy. Let's not forget the uninspired performances by Nancy Allen and John Travolta. At least Allen's character is supposed to be not very bright but Travolta, for someone as smart as he is supposed to be, makes some pretty stupid decisions (the main one being letting Allen meet with the reporter alone). What do we get? The usual De Palma mishmash that leaves the viewer unfulfilled.

De Palma makes use of some of his standard camera tricks - the 360 degree camera pan and split screen - better than he has in most any of his other films.

112,jcanettis,"Uninspiring, Yet Still Watchable",5,24 August 2005,"""Blow Out"" starts quite well: We watch a cheap horror B-movie develop, and when the protagonist psychopath is about to kill a nude girl in a shower, the scene is abruptly cut, and we then watch the production team booing her pathetic... scream (!). Clever and original the beginning of the film may be, but unfortunately this cannot be said for the rest of the movie: On the contrary, it is quite uninspiring and predictable, sometimes reaching the borders of boredom.This is not to say that ""Blow Out"" is overall bad. It features a decent direction by Brian De Palma, and a plot idea which clears the pass grade with ease: The story is about Jack (Travolta) who is a sound technician working for B-movies (as the one appearing in the beginning). One night, as he is out in the wild trying to record various sounds for his library, he happens to witness (and record) a car accident. He manages to rescue the girl, Sally (Allen), but the man in the car is killed. Unfortunately, the man turns out to be the Governor and presidential candidate, and from that point onwards Jack's quiet life is turned upside down...It is a pity that this interesting plot idea could not materialize into a good plot. Instead, the storyline moves in a completely predictable path, sterilized from any ideas or twists that could spice the viewer's interest. On top of that, we have two average performances by Travolta and Allen, with the other actors struggling even to get the ""average"" mark.Still, ""Blow Out"" manages to be watchable.

But instead of Antonioni's philosophical play on life, memory and detail, and Coppola's analysis of suburban paranoia, De Palma is only capable of directing a generic suspense-crime thriller.The poorly-written script is too unrealistic, and the direction often resorts to cinematic clichés to provoke suspense (like the slow-motion car-chase sequence), not to mention the completely melodramatic ending. ""Blow-Out"" is a hollow film, devoid of any real substance, and it only makes matters worse that it was inspired by 2 masterpieces.

""Blow Out"" also show that you can bring ""Blowup"" and ""The Conversation"" together into some kind of a synchronization.The difference between ""Blow Out"" and it's two forerunners is that this version is not as vague, hazy and indistinct. There is more obvious here who has done what and what has happened. This doesn't make ""Blow Out"" to a worse version or less interesting. ""Blow Out"" is a strong cinematic experience. A strong reason for that is Brian de Palma´s perfect direction, but also the good music (even if it sometimes isn't necessary, just redundant) and John Travolta´s acting - maybe his best performance ever.The most inspiring scene is when de Palma let the camera goes round and round in Travolta´s apartment, makes it look like the camera doesn't follow or focus at any object.Brian de Palma has an enormous potential, and here he uses it to maximum.Rating: 8 of 10.",Blow Out

It says something about Brian De Palma that while they were married, he took every opportunity to flash her body. And did she ever have a body worth flashing. Ever since I saw her flash it all in ""Carrie"" I kept my eyes open for any glimpse of that pure white body with a little hint of baby fat. Kind of soft and squeezable.

121,nomorefog,when fiction is not as interesting as fact,5,4 May 2011,"Brian De Palma is a problematic director for the simple reason that he doesn't seem interested in generating his own cinematic ideas. He rips off Hitchcock in 'Carrie', and does the same thing a number of years later with 'Obsession'. He remade 'The Untouchables' which previously stood in its own right as a high quality and popular TV show, whilst 'Blow Out' (referring to a tyre), is almost a direct rip-off of Antonioni's 'Blow-Up.' This kind of approach does not bode well for an auteur critical interpretation of his films, because how can De Palma be the author of his own films when he continually rips off other people who could be labelled more talented that he is? DePalma seems the kind of director who is either on or off, hot or cold, and personally I find many of his other films far less derivative, and more interesting that this one.John Travolta, flush from the success of 'Saturday Night Fever', plays a sound recordist who believes he has on audio tape the last minutes of the life of a politician who, with his girlfriend, has driven off a bridge; the politician drowns after the car they are travelling in careens into the local bay but his girlfriend escapes and survives. Travolta is taking a break from his job on a movie and is out in the wilds recording random sounds for this latest job, and captures inadvertently the sound of a car tyre blowing out. The parallel with the Chappaquidick incident (in which the roles of victim and survivor are reversed), - in which Senator Edward Kennedy drove his car off a pier and seemingly did nothing to save the life of one of his staffers travelling with him - will be obvious to the most dimmest of viewers, those who can at least recall this scandalous incident which occurred in 1969. Sen. Kennedy's political career was compromised and it took him many years of hard work and good public relations to survive the scandal.In the case of Antonioni's 'Blow Up' the instrument for divining the truth was a camera that may have recorded someone being killed but since I haven't actually seen this, it is unfair for me to judge which of these films may be superior given the fact that the plot device is the same for both movies. Unfortunately De Palma's approach lacks the gravitas of the European sensibility, where the problem becomes one of understanding the many layers of a single truth. Should we believe our senses? Is this the only way to garner the truth? And how many versions are there of the truth? And which is the one to believe? Instead, since 'Blow Out' is a Hollywood product, it becomes one of those tedious races against time to convince everybody that Travolta is not making up this story, and that he has in fact recorded evidence of foul play. People are being chased everywhere, in subway stations and in the streets against spectacular backgrounds of firework displays, for example. De Palma is an operatic director who uses incomprehensible plot devices and set pieces that make absolutely no sense to any rational viewer. At least not to me.Unfortunately, the Chappaquiddick incident on which the film is based was so inexplicable and that Sen. Kennedy's behaviour and statements were so fraught with inaccuracies at the time of the incident - does not help the veracity of the film and as a result 'Blow Out' seems to be misconcieved. It seems to be stranded by the inexplicability of fact and the pointlessness of turning it into fiction. Therefore, the film does not possess the authenticity of something like 'All the Presidents Men', but if it is not taken too seriously and accepted as escapism rather than a plausible account of a real life incident, it passes the time painlessly enough. Maybe the audience expected the film to answer the questions about Chappaquidick that were never satisfactorily answered, but if this is so, they would have come away feeling cheated.Unfortunately 'Blow Out' does not rise above the level of middle brow entertainment which it seems to set out for itself, a shame because it could have been much better with a coherent plot, and less flashy displays of cinematic technique from its show off director. I'd put 'Blow Out' on my list of interesting failures. Not must-see but worth a look for the obvious effort involved.",Blow Out
122,rpvanderlinden,How Johnny Got His Scream,10,19 October 2010,"When I saw Brian De Palma's ""Dressed to Kill"" upon its release I said to myself: ""This man (De Palma) is so talented that if he really put his mind to it he could move on from these shallow potboilers and create a masterpiece."" ""Blow Out"" was his next film and it IS his masterpiece - the De Palma film I had been waiting for. It's a dark, winding tale of a movie sound man (John Travolta) who goes out to record the perfect scream for a cheesy horror flick. He eventually gets that scream, and it's how he gets it that is the substance - and tragedy - of the story. A conspiracy thriller, a lurid pulp melodrama, a meditation on the artifice of film-making and the elusive nature of truth - ""Blow Out"" is all this and more. De Palma gives full vent to his powers and his imagination and the results are electrifying. He perfects his use of the wide split screen and uses it to great dramatic effect, so much so that my usual objections to this technique went right out the door. The production design makes frequent allusions to the colours of the American flag - red, white and blue - all the better to reflect, with utmost cruelty, the heart-breaking corruption of the American Dream for the sad-eyed protagonist. Travolta, playing a sound effects artist, and Nancy Allen, as a make-up artist, make a sweet and likable couple. They bond convincingly, partly because they're both so down-to-earth, and partly because they're both experts in artifice. John Lithgow chillingly portrays an assassin who really, really loves his work. The murder in the train station, with the camera tracking along the floor and the monotonous drone of the train announcer's voice - the voice of doom - echoing in the background, is one of the most horrific scenes I have ever experienced in a movie.",Blow Out
123,RaulFerreiraZem,Blow out,6,7 April 2020,"Good film.
Brian De Palma is really good in building suspense and it shows in this one, some of the scenes at the ending are near unbearable to watch due to the amount of tension the film creates. The concept is also good and the film is really well shot, with the only downside that some of the ideas and effects did not age as well as others, namely that one scene where you see John Travolta's face next to the car's wheel getting shot which looks really bad.I can't help but feeling that this film is a disservice to Antonioni's Blow up. I just can't understand the point of referencing and drawing such an influence from a film to do the exact opposite of what made the referenced movie good in the first place. So instead of an essay on art, subjectivity and phenomenology we just get a Hitchcokean thriller. I don't get it. The reason why Blow up was interesting in the first place was because all the investigation and the suspense was a product of the subjectivity of vision. It is almost as if someone did L'avventura but this time the girl that disappears is actually found at the end.The ending was really cool though.",Blow Out
124,ranblackman,Classic De Palma Thriller.,8,30 July 2019,"Very solid thriller. Well made, mostly well-acted, and has a ton of scenes that are well drawn out with the suspense and will leave many on the edge of their seats.The story here is fairly interesting. We have Travolta, who plays a sound effects mixer for several low b-grade horror films. That right there is a point of positivity I want to make sure and the address right out of the gate. This gives us a nice Peak behind the curtain to that very thing which is sound mixing we get to see how they come up with the various sound effects they use when they have to actually go out and about in the scenery and in nature and outside to just wait for the right sound so they can record them and all the other various processes of putting all these various effects together and then compiling them into the finished product of the film. That, as someone who likes to study film and figure out all the ins and outs and all the nooks and crannies and all the little cogs in the well-oiled machine really appreciated getting to see all those details and it really sort of instantly intrigued me to this story as well as what's interesting about what happens after that. What happens after that is when he's on one of these excavations outside he Witnesses a car accident he goes in jumps in a creek holds a lady out and he later finds out once he's taking her to the hospital that this was, in fact, a sort of an assassination involving a candidate for State Governor.From there we get all sorts of plot progression, suspense, intrigued and all that good stuff that usually accompanies this kind of picture . As from that, I can't really say that there's anything in this particular movie that really makes it stand out. That's a little bit of a problem because that is what I seek as an intellectual and as a film fan, I appreciate movies that have something new wants and you need to say, a little dose of variety, that's of course only my preference. I enjoyed this film a lot for what it was which is also something I like to try to do sometimes when I don't get that variety. Brian De Palma is, of course, a very classic very skilled filmmaker ,he knows how to direct suspense and draw it out. There are scenes in this movie that are really hard to watch because of how drawn out, intensely suspenseful and maybe even downright scary They get. Then there's the ending which actually is something I have never seen before in this kind of a movie and it is so disturbing and almost just utterly just tragic it really smacks you right in the face almost it's really Tuff.The acting also is pretty good on Travolta's parts. His co-star Nancy Allen is kind of annoying kind of obnoxious and overly cutesy in this role, she just didn't work for me I kind of found myself almost cringing whenever she came on screen, however, you kind of see the kind of romantic Blossom between her and Travolta's character and it is sad given the answer.So, all in all, this is a solid, suspenseful, well acted, if a bit familiar Thriller by a competent filmmaker to deliver it well and make it something truly watchable and almost classic status. Would recommend if you are a fan of this genre and of De Palma, it has a place in the line up based on the ending alone.",Blow Out
125,atrickyone,Spoof?,4,7 July 2021,"To be candid about it, I thought by the time this movie reached the half way mark that it might be a parody. By the end, sad to say, I have to admit that it wasn't. It was just a seriously feeble movie. De Palma must have blown a fortune on it, most of it ill-spent. The premise was interesting, but the script was cliche-ridden, the camera tricks infantile or plain stupid (ooh, look, let's have the lens circle round the room six or seven times for no reason; ooh, won't it be a genius idea to have camera directly above because ... just because). The plot as developed was thoroughly implausible, and you didn't know whether the perpetrator was an agent and part time serial killer or the reverse. An embarrassment of a role for poor old John Lithgow. John Travolta was good aside from the cringeworthy last scene. It seems from the other reviews that de Palma was a notable director and this one of his best efforts. The others must be real garbage.",Blow Out
126,johnklem,"Antonioni meets Hitchcock via De Palma - well, what did you expect?",5,20 June 2012,"If you don't know who Antonioni was, have never seen a Hitchcock film and, preferably, haven't seen any of Brian De Palma's other work, you'll probably be impressed. For the rest of us, it's a mess, a bizarre chimera stitched together from other people's (and De Palma's own) cast-offs. I first saw it in 1981 and at the time thought it was decent entertainment. Time hasn't been kind to it and maybe more than any other De Palma film, here I have the impression that the whole thing is a joke, as if he wants to see just how far he can push the absurdity and still be taken seriously. I read that Vilmos Szigmond went through more than a year of depression after the disaster of Heaven's Gate. I doubt that working on this film helped much. Travolta and Allen are nice to watch but I'd like my 107 minutes back, please. And a note to Criterion. What in God's name were you thinking of? This is derivative nonsense which has no artistic connection with Blow-Up. There are still scores of important films (such as Blow-Up) just begging to be given a decent Bluray release. Why did you waste time and resources on this one?",Blow Out
127,HeartMonger,The Zenith of Brian De Palma's Films.,10,17 April 2005,"A film starring John Travolta in the early eighties was sure to attract attention, but that did not mean it would necessarily be good. A film about conspiracy, murder, and politics would not take in the best at the box office, but that did not make it bad. Well, in the world at the time ""Blow Out"" was released, John Travolta's career was beginning to fade and more people were being taken in by Science Fiction and slasher(which is noted and poked fun at in the film's opening) films and did not want to use neurons to enjoy this film. Not a wise choice. ""Blow Out"" is a psychological and poignant film about the curiosity and outcomes surrounding the death of a politician. When Jack Terry (Travolta, in what may be his best, but most underrated role to date) is out catching sounds for a film he is putting together, he records(and therefor, witnesses) a car get it's tire blown out and fall into the nearby river. Astounded, he jumps into the car and finds there to be a dead driver, but a woman, very much alive and in distress. He rescues her, and both are taken to the hospital. It is revealed that the lady's name is Sally Bedina(Nancy Allen, in one of her best roles also) and the man she was with is the man who was most likely to be the next president, Gov. McRyan. Chaos ensues when Jack finds out (through his sound recordings) that the car was not hit by a flat tire, but that someone may have shot the tire out, as an assassination. As Sally and Jack delve deeper and deeper into the mystery, someone is out there, watching them, waiting, with an agenda of his own. Cleverly written thriller, which keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire film, never lets up, and suggests what most films(especially in today's times) will not-Conspiracy. In every sense of the word-in the government, in the working classes, in humanity in general. A take from an earlier film, Antonioni's ""Blow Up"" which was released in nineteen sixty-six, this film explores the diversity of human emotions, and motivations. All the characters are clearly developed, and all with different aspects about them.Jack, is a sound man, doesn't seem to care much about opulence, and is an all around type of guy. He is punctual and very quick to find the truth. His psychosis suggests a character which stands to morals, sharp judgment, and a very likable guy in general. John Travolta plays Jack out with sensitivity, profound genuity, and adroit intricacy. As the lead, the film rests well on his shoulders...and with the help from the rest of the fine cast as well.Sally is a naive young woman, full of choices and ambition. She is from a more darker side of history, doing odd jobs for money just to get by, and certainly has more morals than she would let on. She is a very nice and heartful person, but is also afraid of her life ending up wrong. This is where you can see a dark past, and the way Nancy Allen plays her out surely lets the audience know. Allen had passion for this role, and the role itself is not an easy role to fill, there are emotions discreet, and a lot of pain. However, Allen flourishes as she speaks with mannerisms that transcend any other role she portrayed. I learned to like Sally from the moment she opened up to the audience.A supporting turn from Dennis Franz, who is always a reliable actor, makes up for the perfect example of a good supporting role, albeit it offensive in the least.The film can much be compared to the Kennedy assassination, as a politician was killed, and the conspiracy theories were tossed and turned in the tabloids, who are seen in this film as one of the real enemies, but there are many more. One other thing this film proves is that there are Blow outs in the mind, as well as in the film. The more our two heroes find out, the more the art of this film comes clear, and their minds are toyed with, but we as an audience see this, as part of making this a terrific viewing experience. This film was not a success, as far as money goes, but this film is clearly one of De Palma's best efforts, right up there with Scarface and The Untouchables. It is a touching and central effort, with likable characters, a grandiose Pino Donaggio score(one of the maestro's finest) and an ending that will rock your mind. The political undertones are fully understood at the films end, which is something not seen at all today. This is a really good film to show to film classes, film-making classes, film appreciation classes, etc.All in all, one helluva viewing experience, and one that never gets old either, making it one of De Palma' finest hours.",Blow Out
128,Oggz,Beautifully wrapped up,10,13 November 2006,"And by that I mean De Palma's ""I love Hitch"" period, which truly kicked off some years earlier with ""Sisters"" - to my great joy as a big fan of the Hitch style concoction of thriller/slasher/psychodrama. Arguably De Palma's best, it delivers on all fronts - there's mystery, blood, naked and/or murdered women, sex, knives, elaborate and sadistic killings that involve blades and strangulation, psychos, big set pieces, black humour and all the rest of it, with an added bonus of a great story and a brilliant Travolta as a modern leading man Hitch never had the chance to cast. But there's De Palma's own established trademarks too - split screen real time narratives, advanced story clues, multi layered on-screen action and the obligatory big slow motion sequence where time is perversely stretched like a bubble gum. The tragic finale of the story is also unusually poignant, almost superior to ""Vertigo"" in some ways, possibly because we are made to care more about these two than Novak and Stewart.The only weaker links in this otherwise fabulous thriller are Allen as a red haired blonde (she was better in ""Dressed To Kill"") - and Pino Donaggio's score, which is a very mixed and uneven bag in terms of style - ranging from incredibly inspired and even moving (listen how well it works with Travolta running up the stairs in slow motion; you just know he won't make it in time - and so on through to the very end of the closing credits) - to totally inappropriate and downright out of place (the blondie-call-me-ish number preceding his car wreck 5 minutes earlier in the film). The camera, photography and editing are all total virtuoso though, one particular standout being the rotating shot over the bleeping studio equipment with Jack coming in and out of the frame in a perfectly timed and choreographed visual ballet. In relation to this, there's another benefit to this film - it gives a nostalgic and endearing glimpse into the analogue audio and film tape editing era - from a viewpoint of a wholly digitalised today's world, that is.De Palma simply took the relay from Hitch and carried it off into the eighties, lovingly so and nowhere better than in ""Blow Out"". He also turned it up a notch and added a touch of his own pervy elegance. And just as well that he did, because really good Hitch-like movies are nowadays few and far between and quite hard to find. A must-watch.",Blow Out
129,Jerry-93,Undervalued DePalma and Travolta,8,6 May 2000,"All of DePalma's early movies that he wrote and directed pay quite a bit of ""homage"" to other, greater directors.  Dressed to Kill from Psycho; Obsession:  Vertigo; Body Double:  Rear Window and Vertigo (see a pattern?). Well, Blow Out is no different (though it does break the pattern):  it's an audio take on the photography of Antonioni's Blowup.  Travolta plays a b-movie producer's sound man.  One night, while recording some outdoor sound FX for his latest film, he witnesses, and records on audio tape, what appears to be an auto accident that takes the life of Pennsylvania's governor (the movie takes place in Philly, so I assume it's the governor of that state).  By the time he reaches the car, the governor is dead, but the girl (not his wife) that he was with is still alive.  As Travolta develops a relationship with the girl, he comes to believe that what he hears on his audio tape is not a tire blowing out, but a gun shot. When he ""makes"" a film of the incident from still pictures to accompany his audio track, his suspicions are confirmed.  And then the trouble starts.I'd guess not a lot of people have seen this movie in recent years.  It's a shame, because it's really a great movie.  Travolta is good, and this movie doesn't seem any of his tampering that most of his recent films do (these were the days when you could get Travolta for peanuts instead of 1/3 of the budget).  Nancy Allen essentially plays the same role she plays in all of her then-husband's movies:  the dumb blond.  NYPD Blue fans may find the appearance of a thin, fully coiffed Dennis Franz worth a look.  DePalma is very sharp in this one, using a lot of his quirky directorial touches to full effect (especially the scene where Travolta makes the movie of the accident; who would think to do that?).  Clever wrapup, too.  Well worth a look.",Blow Out

I was pleasantly surprised at this good thriller.  The first 40 minutes of this movie was fantastic, but the rest was somewhat boring.  What would have made this a better thriller was if the audience wasn't told so much about the killer, or even if there was a killer.  We should know what travolta knows every step of the way.  By letting the audience know that there was a killer and who he was, it took some of the suspense away especially when travolta made the film of the accident and it was revealed that a gun shot(small light) was present at the exact time of the noise he recorded.

133,byght,Entertaining and stylish,8,27 April 2004,"*Possible spoilers*Like a lot of people, I suppose, I was interested in this film because Quentin Tarantino ranks it as one of his three favorite movies (along with ""Rio Bravo"" and ""Taxi Driver"").  It sure doesn't take long to see why--there's lots to love here for anyone that appreciates skilled direction and a tight story.Stylistically, ""Blow Out"" is just off the charts.  Brian DePalma packs the film with so many unique shots and so many thrilling, tight-as-a-drum sequences that I'm almost inclined to say it's a little too much.  It was one of the only times that I've watched a film and been acutely aware that every single second is being Directed, with a capital ""D.""  Which can be good or bad depending on what you're looking for.The story is basic but compelling noir: a b-movie soundman (John Travolta) records the sounds of what he believes to be an assassination of a presidential candidate, and becomes a target of a clandestine cover-up operation in his attempts to get the truth out.  What I like about the plot is that it HAD to be a movie.  It could never have been a novel or a play. Sight and sound are too integral to the very fabric of the story for it to work in any other medium.  This is what makes DePalma's lavish direction more than just so much masturbation.  The plot also gets an extra brownie point for a pretty tough, shocking, anti-Hollywood ending.There's pitfalls here, too.  The romantic subplot (while not tacked on as in most films) just doesn't do it for me--mostly because Nancy Allen's character is as poorly written and acted a female lead as you will find. And yes, when you get down to it, there's much more style here than substance.But if you have an iota of appreciation for well-orchestrated thrillers, it's tough to see why you wouldn't love this gem of a movie.",Blow Out

Being a political thriller, Blow Out never falls into the trap of being too confusing (like de Palma's Untouchables), too pretentious (Mission to Mars) or too long.

135,brileyvandyke,A Stylish Political Crime Noir,8,11 November 2021,"DePalma's Blow Out is a very stylish film that seemed to be inspired some by Antonioni's Blowup, and is done quite nicely. The film marks a departure for John Travolta and the type of character he portrays in the film. Travolta was very good in Blow Out and it's a shame this film doesn't seem to be widely remembered. John Lithgow is excellent as a sinister assassin who is working as a kind of political hit man run amok. Nancy Allen, who was actually married to DePalma at this time, plays quite nicely as a meek, unwitting pawn in the whole conspiracy.The film was shot in and around Philadelphia and is full of beautiful cinematography. DePalma makes effective use of split screen and split diopter lens. The early scenes of the night recording session and the wildlife by the creek was memorable.

With some homage to B grade horrors, the story is very gripping and young John Travolta also shows some impressive acting skills.Even with a fast-paced and complex enough screenplay, It is one of the film in which story is not a primary thing to consider about. The film tops when it comes to the style and technical aspects. I really enjoyed De Palma's direction and the way whole mystery was developed. Did not see any multidimensional characters or emotional touch (except towards the climax), but still movie's technical elements managed to make it shine. Since the film is all about sound effects, it is the most essential and impressive part of the film. Background score and sound have played a key part in its story as well. Apart from that the use of split frames was also impressive. It is visually sound too. The use of different colors and background shades give excellent effect. And the climax scenes were simply superb.Talking about film's plot, I have to say after a strong start film weakens in the second half. The way it becomes a simple cat and mouse play was a bit let-down for me. Nancy Allen's acting wasn't up to the mark, though she looked really cute. However climax was effective and film's sound effects and visual beauty made me forget everything. Recommended.",Blow Out

I longed for the public in the movie to get access to what us the real viewers got access to, there were parts that were so unrealistic in a film that takes you back convincingly into a quintessential 80's time frame and it just leaves you with either a bitter sweet nostalgia or bitter sweet retroactive learning experience!

138,jcorelis-24336,Extremely interesting thriller,9,27 April 2017,"One of the best political thrillers and one of Brian de Palma's best films, Blow Out features John Travolta in top notch performance as a sound engineer for an independent film making company in Philadelphia which specializes in cheesy soft-porn/slasher films: while out recording night sounds on a creekside for his audio library he sees a car plunge into the water and dives in to save the female passenger but too late to save the male driver, who turns out to be a leading candidate for the US presidency. Later, he realizes from the sounds he recorded that the blow out which caused the accident was caused by a gunshot, something which understandably the powers that be don't want known.Nancy Allen's deliberately flighty performance as the rescued woman provides a perfect foil to Travolta's solidness, and the convoluted plot unfolds through both obvious and subtle allusions to historical events (Chappaquiddick, Dallas) and classic cinema (the title's resemblance to Blow Up is not accidental, and the scenes of mayhem in public venues like a large train station or a patriotic fireworks display where the crowds have no idea what's happening are very Hitchcockian.)

The acting (even Travolta) is not too bad, though it probably doesn't live up to the solid material they are provided. It's interesting to see Denis Franz in an early role, and for someone who's never been much of a John Lithgow fan, this didn't change my mind.

At this time, I like a character of Burk because I tend to prefer strange person and he is curious man for me. I think that the actor is also good.

The first point is Hitchcock's film(""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", ""Conversation"" and ""Blow out"" ) have one of the theme of beauty of women's death. Every film has scene which a woman is killed or depiction of murder. I think it is transiency of beautiful woman's life. Also, it shows the idea of women as possession. That reason is that sometimes women are considered that their position or status is lower than men. This is so strange for me. The second point is the guilty that main character feels in each film. In ""Vertigo"" and ""Conversation"" it is connected to religious thinking. This is thinkable that the director Hitchcock has been Christian and he has been affected. In everyday life there is a possibility people get guilty, so I think Hitchcock and other director who was influenced by him wanted to show that.",Blow Out
145,BassLightyear,Wow. Just wow.,8,27 August 2019,"Films like these make the trip to the cinema worth while... too bad they don't make 'em like this anymore. Obviously inspired by the great Antonioni's film ""Blow-Up"", De Palma makes his own mark on the (neo-)genre, simply by doing his own thing.The film is beautifully plotted, though some of the exposition seem redundant to me (I'm not going to spoil anything in this review, though). But by plotting the story the way he does, De Palma creates a natural, but terrifying, tension-building crescendo, that will have you burning with curiosity - guessing and dreading the inevitable story climax.De Palma is great, but setting the ironic tone of the film from the get-go, (quite literarily), is Pino Donaggio with his breathtaking score. An absolute marvel in cinematic music history. The only other cinematic score, with primary focus on the theme, that I can even begin to compare with Donaggio's, is John William's work on ""Schindler's List"".The reason I deprived this neo-noir masterpiece of a 9/10, besides what's already been mentioned above, was because of some questions that popped up in my head during the film, and was left unanswered by the end of it, but also because of some minor, but ever noticeable, dialogue problems; at one point it felt forced, like a desperate attempt to glue the story together, and it wasn't satisfying to me, not at all, and that particular conversation actually raised questions that were not to be answered, ever.

Unfortunately, most of the video transfers of the film suffer in poor image quality (It's not letterboxed (widescreen)-a must for all of DePalma's, actually anybody's work) and sound quality (since this film is about a sound recordist the sound plays a major role). A DVD has yet to be released, so to this date only the beautiful widescreen laserdisc transfer of the film does it any justice. This film is a personal favourite. If you enjoy DePalma's films (forget ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" and ""Mission to Mars"") and/or political conspiracy thrillers then treat yourself to one of the best. ""Blow Out"" delivers.

148,skcn1818,Middonaito Kurosu,8,7 August 2014,"I think this film is interesting because of two reasons.First, this film has the two sides. One is thriller and another is romantic. Firstly, this film is mainly thriller. When a car is shot by someone and falls down the river, I felt a thrill. On the other hand, I found a romantic side. For example, when Sally faces a risk at the subway, Jack tries chasing her feverishly. The scene I like the best is that Jack holds his head when he hears Sally's scream in the last. Because of this scene, I can clearly understand his love for her. This film has two sides and so I think an audience can enjoy it very much.Second, this film is like a Hitchcock's film. When we watch it, we have many questions in the former part. And at last, we can finally find the answer for almost everything. For example, in the film, Liberty Bell is a key point and in the middle part, man gazes at its board three times. We cannot understand why he does so but it is the important scene in this film. In addition to it, camera moving has a large effect. The most impressed scene is that camera moves in a circular motion. It shows us that the main character is shocked and in an absent sort of way. When I saw this scene, I felt sickly and covered my eyes. It means that I could feel the same thing he feels. This is exactly a remarkable attraction.",Blow Out

The plot might be decent for this movie but the story built around it is unbelievable and poorly written.  The police work is abysmal in the story since they are supposed to be investigating the death of a governor, and future presidential candidate.  The car he wrecks isn't even impounded or investigated the night of the crash, but is left unguarded in a garage.  The governor is able to ""slip out the back door"" of a major event where he's supposed to speak without anyone noticing.  The police don't know how to get material evidence from the film maker?  They aren't suspicious of a man ""happening"" to be there when the car wrecks?  They don't ask for proof he filmed anything else that night?  They can't find him several days later?  My brother once shot photos of a burning building, the police confiscated the film for an investigation and he never saw it again.  Give me a break.

How about the broad daylight dash through town in the Jeep by Travolta, ending well after dark only a few minutes after the crash?  How about the sequence of colors flashing on Travolta's face as he is struck by another of his ""wired"" helpers dying? Have you ever been to fireworks that cast shadows and flashed in constant consistent sequence like that?  It was hard to watch the film and stay with it due to the shabby acting of the fem-fatal as well.  She was poorly cast and couldn't hold a candle to Travolta.  How about the critical judgment errors of Travolta's character... he never gave the girl's name, never mind her number, to the TV guy, how would the TV guy have called her not knowing who she was?  Ugh... with any real examination of the story, it crumbles like a fragile house of cards. This was a real waste of a Saturday night for me.",Blow Out

155,JoanWaterfield,Good start ..bad finish.,3,16 May 2020,"Years ago a Cambridge University scientist published a paper that reached a remarkable conclusion: the rate growth of the male's beard it seems is related to his sexual activity. ""It seems,"" he said in proper scientific jargon. ""that the beard growth in man is a much neglected parameter of hormonal activity that can be readily quantified.""
I quote this piece of scientific trivia in that it may be relevant to John Travoltas scampering through Brian De Palma's Blow Out with a 5 o'clock shadow. An attempt, perhaps, to to reinforce Travolta's sexy charisma as support to the film. or if it is intended to show stress of character in the films hero, Jack Terri (Travolta), it fails as a contrivance in a film filled with contrivances.
Now I happen to like Travolta, feel he has a real sensitivity as an actor,. But it is De Palma who has become the critic's pet: his homage to Hitchcock and now to Antoinini (Blow Up) has prompted effulgent tributes to his 'style'.
But while imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, copy-catting as De Palma does with his myriad of film references doe not serve De Palma well.
For the beginning there was a super idea, a murder caught by ear-dropping sound man Terri. And a dandy opening to this film as the camera tracks a heavy breathing murderer through a sorority house. Most of the sisters are in an advanced state of undress and the ultimate victim is starkers in the shower. A squeak of terror and the camera pulls back to reveal a movie within a movie, a sleaze film that is a wonderful send up of shock shlock.
And so we first meet Jack Terri whose sound work in porno films such perks as a very classy apartment.
A dedicated technician, Terri is next seen in a park, searching for new effects. Sound of a car approaching, the report of a blow out and the car plunges into a creek. As does Jack, but not before he's noted that audio needle jump. That tire was shot out, the victim is the state governor and the presence of a young blonde rescued by Jack is something to be hushed up.
A whiff of Chappaquddick right? And so far so good. But then De Palma seeks further reference to the book of political dirty tricks with the appearance of a Gordon Liddy clone. This nasty type has gone beyond a situation of political embarrassment to murder and now embarks on the slaughter of unhappy hookers to mask the ultimate killing of the girl in the case.
Having got the Who's and the What's, the audience is left with an unresolved Why.
De Palma finks on his good idea, overloads the film with the artiness of Vilmos Sigismond's photography, fails to create empathy with Travolta or sympathy for the not-to-bright blonde (Nancy Allen). Fails too in providing a clean line of mounting suspense. And a final appendage which shows Jack using the dying scream of the girl in the original porno film which could be interpreted as a final note of cynicism, becomes merely an example of the De Palma cutes.",Blow Out

Apart from one, small individual twist, I found this very predictable, and very very dated. Some movies age well, and actors performances, such as Michael Caine, never fade. Travolta can be great in some movies, and I don't think this was necessarily his fault - I just thought that the script contained nothing, no flair, no surprises, I was bored half an hour in and nothing changed that.

Despite some obvious 'borrowing' from Hitchcock and others, DePalma puts together a very engrossing movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

He rescues a girl from the wreckage, but leaves the male inside. It turns out he is a high profile politician, and the girl (Nancy Allen) is his little secret.The plot takes twists and turns all the way from here, and features a stand-out performance from a quite frankly barking John Lithgow!

160,exiledinnj,Could have been better,6,4 December 2007,"I picked up a VHS tape for $2.99, not having seen the film on cable for several years. There it was again, that 70's color, as if much of the film has been shot through a pink/red Kleenex. My copy of Long Good Friday looks like that too. And there are all those show-off camera angles too. When I see dePalma I always think of that mirror in the ceiling feature that supposedly was the norm of most German and Viennese bordellos.What was fascinating is watching the techniques of 1980 being used by Travolta and the movie makers, the splicing and the lack of special effects we would have today.Everyone mentions Blow Up, The Conversation and The Parallax View, when writing about this film, and of course, the obligatory references to Hitchcock. To my mind the plot line goes back to The 39 Steps, the innocent man who happens to get involved. Hitchcock borrowed from himself many, many times, so I guess we can forgive dePalma here, but it is hard to forgive needless padding.The scene with the hooker has nothing to do with advancing the plot or ratcheting up suspense, but is there to give dePalma another ceiling shot, or peeping tom shot. We know what Lithgow is; it does not have to be reinforced.What follows takes the film from a suspense thriller into something we clearly recognize today: an ending so out of kilter with what could happen that it spoils the film. It is 5pm, rush hour, and 30th Street Station is practically empty. dePalma has the inspired notion to have Lithgow ape the statue in the walkways above the floor of the station....and here comes Travolta and Allen, neatly finding a parking space in the short term spots used for pickup.Of course, Lithgow sees the drop off and decides to take Allen to the subway to kill her, rather the trolley line that runs underground alongside the subway tracks. To be accurate, the station dePalma shows is actually 15th Street, two miles east, but only a Philadelphian will know that. Travolta is also actually at 15th Street/30th Street....he sees Allen on the trolley and heads for the Wrangler.Through City Hall Courtyard he drives; even then I believe that area was blocked off. He crashes the jeep into Wanamakers window, is knocked out but comes to. It's dark so time has passed but Lithgow is still messing around with Allen down by the river, two miles away. JT leaps out of the ambulance and magically is 8 blocks closer at Independence Hall. Did he take the subway? Catch a bus? Now he has another mile to reach the waterfront but he gets there, but too late.As long as we suspend our belief that the Philly cops were that bad and that one nut could veer out of control, the earlier part of the plot is excellent, but that ending drags the film down.",Blow Out

If the premise was to set him up with a floozy; then why shoot him? Why did Lithgows character kill that one woman the way he did when he knew it wasn't the gal he was looking for? Why would they erase all of Travoltas tapes and how could they have that much time to do it?? (If you want to do something quick, you set fire to the place.

The movie is campy, not as campy as Michael Caine in nurse drag campy though. DePalma is borrowing from Blowup (Antonioni) and Hitchcock. Now, Blowup, the Antonioni classic that features David Hemming as a well-known fashion glam photog who believes he discovers a murder while developing a roll of film of one of his shoots. This is a groovy movie with up and coming rock star cameos like Jeff Beck smashing a guitar, the Yardbirds, and cool posters of Dylan and Ziggy Stardust. Anyway, I digress. Travolta hears and discovers the sounds of a possible murder on audio, and Voila, DiPalma merges BlowUp with Blow Out. Now add Hitchcock for some voyeuristic effect and Troila.

Not only are you the only witness, you have a recording of the drowning as well.  Then imagine you're told you should forget about the whole thing, keep your mouth shut, and return to life as if nothing happened.This is the situation in which John Travolta finds himself at the beginning of Blow Out, an entertaining film which has its moments, but ultimately suffers from bad writing and a preposterous ending.After witnessing the drowning of a potential Presidential nominee (think Chappaquidick), Travolta is suspicious of foul play for at least two reasons.  First, he was told to keep quiet.  This would be enough to make most people suspicious.  But Travolta has other evidence -- his own recording of the drowning and his own memory of the ""accident"".  As a sound effects man for B-movies, Travolta is familiar with the subtleties of recorded sound, and his recording convinces him there is more to the accident than simple adultery and drunk driving.  Of course, he's right.The most positive element of the film is Travolta himself.  He manages to center and ground the film, something which nothing else in the film is able to achieve.  He's great to watch -- especially during the opening scene of the film, in which (thankfully) there is no dialogue.  He makes the most of what's given to him, and his presence is formidable.  It was his performance that kept my interest.Beyond this, however, I'm at a loss to understand all the generous praise heaped upon this film.  In particular, I found the music distracting and irratating.  Does every important scene have to be manipulated into an operatic gesture?  The plot itself isn't too focused.  There is a ""slasher"" subplot which seems to serve no purpose at all.  Some of the dialogue is ridiculous, including a scene between Travolta and Allen which takes perhaps 5-7 minutes, but seems to last an hour and a half, while Allen describes the nuances of cosmetics and Travolta recalls his previous work.The movie starts with a good idea, but never really seems to develop it much.  Although it's entertaining, I didn't care much about anyone except Travolta.  Especially not Allen, whose character is written as the stereotypical dumb blonde.I won't say much about the ending, except that it's incredibly unique. Whether that's good or bad is your own opinion.  I was laughing during the ending, which (I presume) I wasn't supposed to be doing.  Maybe I haven't seen enough Wagner.  ;)If you're looking for light entertainment, I give a marginal recommendation.

If this movie would have gotten more critical praise, Travolta would surely have received an Oscar nomination. De Palma often tries to imitate the great Hitchcock in his style of filmmaking, and in this movie he hits the bullseye.  The movie is set in Philadelphia during the Liberty Bell celebration and follows Travolta as he uncovers a major league conspiracy involving the assassination of a prominant political figure.  The movie also features something very rare in today's movies; it doesn't end with the typical ""happy"" ending.  Very suspensful and in my top 10 of all time, don't miss this one.",Blow Out
167,julienpinault,Blow Out,8,20 August 2018,"'Blow Out' is a 1981 thriller written and directed by Brian De Palma. The film stars John Travolta as a sound recordist for movies who becomes involved in a dangerous conspiracy after accidentally recording an alarming piece of evidence.De Palma's passion in the story is evident on screen, which came to him while working on the sound for his previous film 'Dressed to Kill.' He has crafted a riveting, unique piece of suspenseful filmmaking, especially for those interested in the medium. You can see De Palma's appreciation for sound design, lingering on recording instruments in striking closeups as we see Travolta carefully do his work. There is a scene in which his character 'Jack Terry' explains to Nancy Allen's character what he does for a living. She is initially confused, and precedingly fascinated, as if she never realised sound was actually designed for movies. It is clear De Palma must have had personal experience with a situation similar to this, and it adds to the sense of realism in the film. During sequences where we see the sound design process, the audience is treated with respect. The actions are not explained and we must therefore watch carefully, as the character is, what is happening. As you watch you feel as if you are learning secrets of moviemaking, which is one of the best aspects of the film and very rare in films today.The style of the film escalates the unique story, which is slightly inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film 'Blow-Up,' in which a murder may or may not have been witnessed and recorded in a London photographer's work. De Palma's fresh take on the story oozes style. Vilmos Zsigmond, cinematographer of 'Close Encounters of the Third kind' and 'The Deer Hunter' elevates the style of the film with rich, almost surreal images within a fairly grounded, realistic story. These surreal images with creative uses of lighting-a particular shot which stood out to me was one in which the camera is positioned inside a motel room, facing Travolta's character who sits by the window at night, listening to the fateful recording. The rain on the window pane is illuminated from what is presumably a car's light from outside, giving the rich red colour of blood. Combined with a blue curtain behind Travolta, a colour representative of anxiety, the shot reflects the state of his mind at that moment. There are frequent uses of colour throughout, with neon lights almost giving the feeling of a neo-noir film. A staple of the cinematography of De Palma's films is the split-focus diopter lens. It is a half convex second lens which is attached to the initial lens which allows areas of the background and foreground to simultaneously be in focus. The eye is not used to seeing this kind of image, so it may almost create a sense of anxiety due to its heightened surrealism. It is used in several scenes, most notably in the sound recording scene where it builds tension effectively with incredible shots involving owls and frogs in the extreme foreground, with Travolta in the background. It is also used to amplify John Ligathow's chilling performance, especially when he is listening to characters nearby - his face in the extreme foreground, his probable next victim in the background, still in focus.The screenplay is very cleverly written, with the story unfolding to the audience and characters as new information and characters are revealed. The sense of dread gradually increases throughout as everything becomes heightened. However, the ending of the film felt rather rushed and was slightly disappointing. This may be partly due to the fact that two reels of film were stolen of the Liberty Parade sequence and had to be reshot. On the other hand, I am willing to accept the ending due to the near perfection of the rest of the film.To conclude, 'Blow Out' is a riveting thriller, worth watching if you enjoy the genre and a must-see if you are interested in the filmmaking process or a fan of John Travolta, who gives possibly his best performance.",Blow Out

170,moviebug06,"decent enough suspense, many holes/missing elements",6,9 April 2007,"It works well enough at a superficial level to watch as a thriller/suspense Travolta is really good. It was o.k. to watch as a mindless use of time, but to think about? Don't Problems ""Politicalconspiracy"" ""Political"" No political context is put forward in the least, in general or in particular to this candidate, or politics and candidates generally. A Gov. and likely Prez candidate--it isn't campaign season yet, ends up dead in a river in a car crash. The only other ""political"" aspect is that some handlers want to suppress info and Travolta and Allen's stories. Supposedly for ""protecting his family."" Handlers are nothing neither new nor necessarily conspiratorial, nor are ""family"" considerations always false. Obviously more is supposedly driving the suppression, but what? No antagonist, no agenda, no alternate candidate to benefit. Nothing. Political? No.""Conspiracy"" What conspiracy? There's no conspiracy present but the hint that a conspiracy exists. Aside from an aide and one interaction with a detective who ""loses""/ ""denies"" that any evidence exists from what Travolta provides, nothing. Why not try another cop? Esp. given that the one is hostile to him. What conspiracy is there of other people? All we get is Lithgow talking to the phone, once, to some generic old-white-male politico type.Car crash as assassination attempt? If so, it's only known via call from the above conversation that Lithgow went off the reservation beyond what his ""bosses"" wanted. But all he does is shoot out a tire. Is that an attempted murder? How likely is it to cause a crash into the water below in the given span of bridge? As a mode of trying to kill someone, firing one shot into the tire of a car driving by in the hope that it will: 1. Hit the tire, 2. Cause the car to swerve so uncontrollably, 3. So uncontrollably in the given span of bridge to cause the car to crash into the river, 4. That the candidate won't be able to survive the crash or be able to escape the sinking car and swim to shore.The real crux of the plot rests on this: When Travolta helps Allen get ready to go meetsupposedly-- the reporter: Why didn't he call the reporter to verify the meeting? Or go himself given that: 1. All were under threat (then why stay at own home throughout?) 2. The reporter wanted to meet with Travolta anyway. Point: Travolta tells Allen he doesn't have a copy of the ""original film"" (he does have a copy of his audio recording). Question: Is he lying to her or telling the truth? If he's telling the truth it's insanely stupid to send her off with the only copy. His excuse for his stupidity? He wires her because, in case the reporter takes the film but later says he never did, Travolta can prove he did take it. But if he does take it and destroys it or denies it exists, having him on tape saying ""I'll take it"" doesn't prove the film exists. It could be a blank film, so says the reporter. So the filmwith no existing copyproving conclusively that the tire was shot out, doesn't exist for Travolta to give to prove his position. Dumb. The wire does nothing to help if the reporter wants to get rid of it, i.e., is in on the conspiracy.On the other hand, if Travolta is lying to Allen and really has a copy of the film, why does he lie to her? The only explanation would be so that she can honestly tell the reporter it's the only copy that exists. That way, the reporter might be willing to believe her because, in case he's in on the conspiracy, he'll ""know"" he can destroy the evidence/film and stop Travolta. But: What reasonable person in on a conspiracyone that he knows Travolta believes exists, wouldn't doubt that a copy existed just because a simpleton tells him it's the only one? She could easily be duped by JT or be lying, and if Travolta is a serious person as a he very much is, who would believe that he hadn't made a copy if the issue of a political assassination is at hand? If Travolta gave Allen the original, he's stupid. If he gave Allen a copy, but lied to her so that the reporter-if-conspirator would believe Allen that there is no copy, that's almost as stupid.People rave about the ending, but it's what's not there that's the real issue, as interesting as the ending is.What happened to the film? If the only copy was destroyed by being tossed in the river, what is Travolta going to say to the real reporter when he asks to see/get the film that Travolta said he'd give him? 4 options: 1. Tell reporter he lied; never had the film. 2. Say he had it, but between yesterday and today it was (including by he himself) destroyed/stolen/etc. 3. That he still has it, but won't show/give it to him. 4. Tells him what happened with Allen/Lithgow.In any case, the reporter is going to run a story about it, tell the cops/some officials. In which case Travolta will be investigated heavilypossibly Travolta was involved in the crash/killing? De Palma doesn't offer any indication in the end about the film issue. If he wrote it under the Travolta is ""stupid"" scenario, that's a horrible, i.e. dense, plot fulcrum point. If he wrote under the Travolta is ""almost as stupid"" scenario, that's also dense conception. By making no reference about the film at the end, it suggests to me that Allen had the only copy and it's in the river. If soIf Travolta does have a copy, I think the movie would make some reference to him still having it.I think De Palma blew this important point.",Blow Out

The film grabs you from the beginning as the camera glides around outside, peeping into unsuspecting victims houses, whom happen to be young beautiful half naked, or completely nude women having sex or having sex by themselves. This is one of the things you expect from the 70's and early 80's DePalms movies! Then the director yells ""Cut!"" and then walking and shouting stage hands move in. Come to find the beautiful and outlandish opening scene is just a movie Jack Terry (John Travolta) is editing. He is a b-budget horror movie sound tech, working for the same sleazy director for the past couple years. Later, while Jack is recording effects for the same movie, he witnesses a car lose control and crash into a lake. He manages to save one of the victims from drowning, the beautiful Sally (Nancy Allen), but the other passenger, a married politician, drowns. Soon nagging cops, scandal and curiosity drag Jack into a world of mystery and murder. The pacing is perfect, in a comparable way to Mr. Hitchcock. The cinematography is very good, swooping and zooming like usual with most of DePalma's earlier thrillers. There was great use of color in the film, adding to the story and making for an amazing climax.John Lithgow, a DePalma regular, makes a great theatrical and just plain cool performance as well. He is a paid thug who was hired to complete a simple mission, but he has other plans and turns out to be way more than what they had bargained for.9 out of 10!!!!!

176,Buster-40,So over the top it's irresistible...,7,14 June 1999,"The truth is that there are a couple of large holes in the plot and some of the acting is less than stellar (just try to avoid rolling up in a ball and begging Nancy Allen to stop using that voice) but the story itself is so compelling and the visual elements so audacious, so over the top (especially the climatic scene in which you could swear you're watching opera) that it's very hard not to be drawn in by this movie. Travolta is finely unmannered and the scenes in which he is taping the accident and also those in which he is reliving the accident through the tapes are particularly enjoyable.",Blow Out
177,f.bollet,Blow it!,4,18 July 2002,"It is just a bad movie with an unconvincing storyline and poor actor performances. It starts with a movie in the movie: a very bad motion picture in the making for which John Travolta is the soundman. At the end of `blow out', I am not sure that there is as much of a contrast as was intended by De Palma with its beginning. A comparison with a spoof of poor cinematography and a good scream are not enough to make a good film. John Travolta's character has probably more depth that could be found in a spoof, but the upgrade is tenuous, and we are still in shallow water. If there had been some humour, then John Lithgow wacky performance could have been entertaining, but it is meant to be serious business. Overall, the storyline too obviously contorted to bring up unlikely situations, the stereotypical nature of all the characters, and constant references to good films only underline the poor and confused vision of de Palma as a director. You will enjoy your time much more and longer by coldly prospecting details in Antonioni's  `Blowup', listening to `The Conversation' with Gene Hackman and pursuing trains with Popeye in `The French Connection'. Words lack to describe the helplessness I felt while watching Travolta running to the rescue though the crowd: it was ridiculous, unbelievable, gave me the feeling I had been wasting my whole evening, and it was just too close to the end to meaningfully switch the TV off...  Save yourself and just blow it!",Blow Out
178,stranmansmc,An above-average thriller that doesn't live up to it's potential,6,2 November 2021,"The combination of a terrific plot, a strong script, and good acting would seem to be the elements of great movie. However, I came away disappointed by ""Blow Out"" because it could have been so much better. The tension builds throughout the film as Jack (John Travolta) attempts to reveal a conspiracy. But about three-quarters of the way through the movie it begins to run out of steam. Ironically, for a plot where sound and sound recording is an integral part of the story, the musical score for the film was uninspired and at times insipid. This film had many good aspects, but it just didn't fulfill its potential.",Blow Out
179,Westlake123,Brian De Palma's forgotten masterpiece.,8,19 September 2012,"In 1981, Brian De Palma released what might be considered his ""best"" thriller to date. The ""Slasher"" genre was at full blossom, and the conspiracy driven, psychological thrillers of the 1970s were slowly declining in terms of popularity. ""Blow Out"" stars John Travolta as Jack, a sound engineer for an independent movie picture, that discovers what first appears to be a tragic car-accident - is in fact a murder. Sally, who is rescued from the wreck by the protagonist (Travolta) himself stays as his counterpart though out the movie. Jack must set the story straight, and prove the police wrong.De Palma is known for his themes of guilt, paranoia and obsession which work as essential parts for the character development in ""Blow Out"". It's a hell of ride from start to finish, and one can truly state that Brian De Palma is a master of suspense. The acting of John Travolta is superb and convincing, and I dare to say that it's his best role to date. I was a bit skeptical to Nancy Allen at first, but her naive character grew on me over the course of the film, and might actually be one of the things that makes this film so great; that is believable character development without the often sudden change of identity. Blow out is stylish, and both the directing of De Palma and cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond is highly impressive. From beautifully shot scenes in the vein of Francis Ford Coppola to the drastic suspense of Hitchcock, De Palma uses all the best tricks in the book. ""Blow Out"" is non-stop suspense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The last 15 minutes finale is quite extraordinary. The atmosphere, mood and cinematography are all close perfect. It truly is Brian De Palma's forgotten masterpiece.",Blow Out
180,DennisHogensen,One of my All-Time Favorite Movies,10,12 June 2006,"This to me is one of the best Philadelphia and Bicentential movies that there is.It is set in Philly during the celebration of 1776 (in 1976) and it really shows the sights of the city.There is a scence when Tavolata is going sown the streets of the city looking for a suspect with the police and it seems so realistic , just like you were in the police car yourself.Travolta as usual does a great job of acting. However, the stat of this movie, like James Bond movies is the villain, John Lithgow. he is absolutely manic in mission to be shoot the candidate.The ending is great.",Blow Out
181,mklelito-91813,Great all round,8,5 July 2021,One of those hidden gems that just feels right thanks to the cinematography and talents of DePalma and Travolta. It all just fits like a glove!

182,Vince Perrin,Filming the unfilmable: sound,7,23 September 2001,"Everything there is to say has been said about the Hitchcockian tricks that Brian DePalma has made his own and uses in his films. They are all in ""Blow Out,"" from the bookend surprises that frame the film to his constantly moving camera, the colors and music he selects, even some of the casting. Sound, difficult to make visual, is a key element here, on the soundtrack and in the plot. Almost clever to a fault, DePalma has found a way to let us see the sound as well as hear it. In the end, we can only marvel at how he tells the story with his camera, how he uses real life incident, such as a politician's car plunging off a bridge and into water with a woman not his wife inside. John Travolta has never been sexier or more confident of his skills, and the thriller elements here are really thrilling.",Blow Out
183,sakari-laiho,Not so good.,4,8 December 2011,"Really horrible boring old movie. It's horrible, because the idea is so stupid, the ending is so ridiculous, the girl is too much blonde...All because there's Travolta and there's nice camera-use, is not making good movie at all! It's not year 1981, it's 2011 and that's the biggest thing, this movie is too old for viewing, unless you wanna watch comedy.I do not recommend this movie to anybody. Why is it so long anyways? There's so much stupid things happening, far away realistic scenes. I really am sad to have wasted over 2 hours of my life for watching this!I do not recommend this movie to anybody.

185,aida_gradina,What a disappointment...,4,7 November 2017,"This film is not timeless, it is stuck in 1981 and will forever stay there. However, before getting into details, I did enjoy the split screens and the attention to detail of the equipment and meticulousness of the sound recordist played by John Travolta. I enjoyed the opening scene of the ""slasher film"" the main character works on. It felt like a commentary to other films of its time, especially on how women were/are viewed in such genres. Thinking Blow Out will go in a different direction I thought it to be clever, especially in 1981 to start a film in such fashion. Unfortunately, Blow Out was a continuation of that. It was frustrating watching a film that portrayed all female characters as either porn stars, incredibly dumb, naive, or extraordinarily helpless where the only way they are able to survive is with a man's help. I don't know what the director was thinking, did he portray the female characters like that on purpose? Is there a message? Is it a commentary after all? I don't know, and honestly I don't think so. All I know is that this is a very sad portrayal of women, and an even sadder attempt to make a thriller which has been done before. Utterly disappointing, and just really boring.",Blow Out
186,hwthorn,Blow Out = Body Double?,5,18 December 2005,"I have enjoyed De Palma films, Travolta is Travolta, and John Lithgow is always good. I read thru the comments and I think the bases have been covered; good and bad. While reading the comments I was looking for the mention of Body Double. I was surprised to find that apparently no-one saw the similarities. Camera angles, lighting, music, and the helpless observer. The 360 degree camera rotation made me dizzy before it finished. Both leading men were involved with film. Both men were on the outs with either their current employer or their past one. There was no resolution to the question of who killed the presidential candidate. Miss Allen and Dennis Franz were both weak as well as the script. While I watched the entire movie, all I could think about were the similarities.",Blow Out
