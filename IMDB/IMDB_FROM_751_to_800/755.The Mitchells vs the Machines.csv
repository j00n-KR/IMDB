0,MartinHafer,"Not bad but too loud, hyper and overwhelming for my taste.",4,21 August 2021,"""The Mitchells vs. The Machines"" is a highly original CGI movie from Sony that was bought by Netflix. Some things about it are very nice, such as some of the family interactions and the film's sense of humor. Other things, such as the hyperkinetic style, are off-putting....at least to me.I noticed many very positive reviews for this movie and wonder if age is a deciding factor. I'm in my 50s and just found it too loud, too bright, too fast and I wanted it just to be over after a while. But I did like the film's internet memes they parodied and the premise. So, overall, it's a mixed bag...particularly for old farts like me! Worth watching? Perhaps. But I lost interest about halfway through it...but managed to keep watching. Afterwards.... I just felt like turning off the TV and having some peace and quiet.By the way, is it just me or do you also think it's highly ironic that this film about how computers will take over our lives and the world was made on computers?!",The Mitchells vs the Machines
1,SnoopyStyle,fun,8,9 May 2021,"The Mitchells are a quirky family. Daughter Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson) is an aspiring filmmaker but her classmates ridicule her. She is accepted into film school and finds her own tribe. She is eager to leave home but her father (Danny McBride) fears letting her go. He refunds her plane ticket and takes the family on a cross country road trip to her school. Mother (Maya Rudolph) tries to keep the peace while dino-obsessed little brother is dragged along. It's not the end of the world or is it? Unbeknownst to them, the launch of a new phone AI is leading to the machine apocalypse.This is written and directed by Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe. Their most prominent previous work is writing for Gravity Falls. This has a lot of that show's sensibilities and I love it. I love the animation styles. I love the family. It's a quirky family. It's a quirky family with a wild outrageous world-ending apocalypse and it's fun. My only complaint is that this may be a bit too long. Of course, I would look to add another scene with the Poseys. It would be great to have the Poseys return to cower in the gas station and telling the Mitchells to hide. It would be the inflection point and a call to arms moment. As it stands, the father acquiesces to his daughter. If the Poseys come back, little Aaron could gain confidence to be heroic. Mother Linda can strive to show her family's worth and father would still be the last to join. It would work better with a better catalyst. All in all, this is a fun movie and everybody should watch it. Afterwards, you can binge Gravity Falls.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
2,Tweekums,An impressive animated action comedy,8,9 May 2021,"The Mitchells are a fairly typical, if slightly dysfunctional, family. Daughter Katie is a bit of an outsider at her school but is looking forward to attending film school in California... thousands of miles from her family. After an argument her father unilaterally decides that rather than have Katie take the plane as planned, the whole family will drive across the country together. Katie is unimpressed but soon she, her parents, her dinosaur obsessed brother and their pug are on their way. Shortly after they set off news comes thorough of a major technological advance; cell phones will soon be defunct; replaced by robots. As soon as the designer announced this the robots rebel and start capturing all humans. Only the Mitchells remain free; it will be up to them to save humanity!I really enjoyed this animated film; there were plenty of laughs from start to finish as well as child friendly thrilling moments and mild scares. It might not be as philosophically deep as Pixar films but it still had something to say about family without being mawkish. It didn't over use pop culture references, and those that there were, such as the nods to 'Kill Bill' were subtle enough that those who don't get them won't be thinking they've missed something. The animation is impressive with good character designs and the voice cast do a fine job throughout. Overall I'd certainly recommend this; it is a lot of fun and suitable for all ages.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
3,Quinoa1984,A Rhombus of Infinite Delights!,10,3 May 2021,"My first impression with this was to say, clearly, the thing that A Goofy Movie was missing (or even the human-character parts of Toy Story 3) was the AI super-charged Robopocalypse. But it's much more artistically ambitious and driven by a theatrical, hyperkinetic vision than that. Thrilling, heartfelt, hilarious. Lord and Miller productions match and in some cases surpass Pixar. It's got deliriously and constantly inspired animation, an aesthetic that works for and earns respect within 6 minutes of when it starts (what else to say about a teenage filmmaker who makes the kind of magic that is akin to Wonder Shozen, only better because it's 2021 and we've all learned so much how to do it better), and Olivia Colman voices an evil app.Without question this will inspire a ton of young people to go to film school, and hey maybe one of you will call your lovable doofus of a dad and see how he's doing. Mitchells vs the Machines is about how to or how not to function in a family, especially how a daughter with a mental/emotional block with a dad (and it's very much a Why Are Dads saga), and why having a simple conversation can, you know, do a lot. Oh, and Furbys will kill you all.And more than comparing to Goofy Movie, you know what this is? It's The Simpsons back when it was *great* - cutting edge satire, self conscious and knowing so deeply about culture right now, but with a heart as big as a... Rhombus!What else should the Black Void of Distant Space have but Wifi?",The Mitchells vs the Machines
4,Mr-Fusion,"Colorful, chaotic and endearing",7,6 November 2021,"A robot uprising of the humorous kind, The Mitchells vs the Machines came at me from behind and got its hooks in. A Netflix animated flick I had no interest in (my 11 year-old felt differently) and ended up fully in its embrace. The father-daughter storyline is handled with care even azs the Mitchell clan is hunted by robots and giant Furbys (you read that right). The animation's vivid and the characters well-drawn (no pun intended) while the sentiment is heartfelt. Lord and Miller are becoming household names they've been killing it.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
5,cherold,fast and furiously funny,8,2 June 2021,"This movie's frenetic style takes a little getting used to. It lays in weird effects ranging from real-life video to cartoonish scribbles over its more conventional computer animation, which is both fun and sometimes jarring, and at first I was concerned that this was all just a way to make up for a lack of substance. But once the movie moves from angsty-teen family comedy to insane apocalypse it just keeps getting wilder and funnier, and the various visual quirks become increasingly charming.The story is engaging although unpersuasive even by the standards of kids cartoons; you could write a long list of nonsensical technology tropes (water? Seriously?) but this isn't the sort of movie where you wind up doing that; it's so fun you forgive it pretty much everything, including its sentimental and overlong final scenes.Very funny family drama suitable even for childless adults who like whacky cartoons. Well worth watching.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
6,Edvis-1997,6,6,8 May 2021,"Well, let's start from rating... This movie is so overrated, how it can have about 8 Imdb, that's a mistery for me. It's good animation movie but only for kids. I don't see how it can interact with adults. It just performs that very badly. It's very messy to watch, a lot happening in one scene, then 20minutes of no action, then again action in one scene and silence after that. The main idea is kind of good but not original, there are plenty of movies with the same idea and I'm looking for something unique. Can't give it more than 6 and I wouldn't ecourage people to watch it. Better pick Raya and the Last Dragon, Frozen, Shrek or any other classic movie.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
7,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Hyperactive but heartfelt.,7,8 May 2021,"'The Mitchells Vs The Machines (2021)' is an energetic, mile-a-minute family drama from producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (whose work includes '21 Jump Street (2012)', 'The Lego Movie (2014)' and 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)') that aims to prove that Sony Pictures Animation isn't just a one-trick pony (the aforementioned web-slinging surprise hit). It's definitely hyperactive, playing with 'internet culture' in a way that almost confirms stereotypes about modern day reduced attention spans. It doesn't dampen the experience, though; it just means that you have to adjust to its quick, almost unforgiving pace. Having said that, the story itself is actually rather slow to get going (it feels often unrelenting in the moment because there is often so much stuff packed into so little space). It's also a tad long on the whole and is, generally speaking, really predictable. These issues don't mean that the movie isn't entertaining, though. It's rather fun when it gets going and its characters feel relatively rounded. There are a handful of exciting set-pieces and the jokes land more often than they flop (though there are some cringe-worthy moments, for sure). The thing is also beautiful from a technical point of view. It's animation is lively, believable and full of joy. Actually watching the picture is enjoyable in and of itself. Overall, it's a solid animated effort with just about the right balance of humour and heart. 7/10.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
8,Cineanalyst,Streaming Wars Get Out of Hand,7,10 May 2021,"How serendipitous given its big-tech filmmaking scenario that ""The Mitchells vs the Machines"" would be sold off from Sony, now largely an old media conglomerate, to the progenitor of streaming services, Netflix. Nominally, the tech CEO here shares his forename with Mark Zuckerberg, struts on stage in front of employees and sycophants to present new products, Siri-esque (or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) HAL) PAL in hand, like he's the late Steve Jobs, a logo reminiscent of the Amazon arrow or smile thing surrounding him, as like just about every tech company stealing and abusing customers' personal data, including for robotics or some form of what's commonly termed ""artificial intelligence."" If that's all there was here, though, it'd be a hypocritical slap in the face to audiences--embodying the very qualities that it supposedly critiques in its Terminator-for-kids apocalypse (being especially derivative of ""Terminator Genisys"" (2015)). It still is largely, which along with its diabetic-levels of sugary family sap is why I have mixed feelings for it, but there's also the reflexive device of the filmmaker being a character.This, at least, allows for a less duplicitous self-serving message as distributed by Netflix. Note that the resolution to the robot apocalypse doesn't reside with the Luddite position of the father, but with a compromise of technology serving human interests--specifically, to aid in our making and viewing motion pictures. Look at how the filmmaker daughter drives the car through PAL's Silicon Valley headquarters--like a data signal being sent along cables. Indeed, like a virus as the dog's face attacks each computerized robot. Moreover, it's a film-within-the-film as presented by YouTube product placement, through the actual internet dynamics and streamed to screens big and small, that's humanity's best hope.It's obvious this isn't a serious (or seriously funny) examination of the role of technology, let alone the corporate capitalism of big tech, by the fact that the animation is entirely imbued with the aesthetics of social media and web videos. It's the usual 3D computer animation, but as if put through those camera filters, made into memes, and with the action constantly paused so as to be digested through the content creator's wisecracks for those with miniscule attention spans. Personally, I suppose I'm relatively a bit of a Luddite myself and so find revolting this sort of imagery, forms of communication and glorification of glowing faces drowning in their phone addictions, but I admire the thorough symmetry of it here, as opposed to an inconsistent bit such as, say, the texting sequence in ""Crazy Rich Asians"" (2018). Plus, the eye of the computer frame (or the equivalent of the no-longer-existent camera) really, manically moves. More than two-and-a-half decades after ""Toy Story"" (1995), it's hard to make 3D computer animation still appear a stunning spectacle, so kudos to ""The Mitchells vs the Machines"" for succeeding as much as it does in that respect. It especially helps that the picture is made to appear as if being constructed within by the filmmaker character--the movie proper being but an elaborate variation on ""Good Cop Dog Cop.""",The Mitchells vs the Machines
9,cricketbat,"Starts off mechanical, but it ramps up by the end",8,21 May 2021,"The Mitchells vs the Machines starts off pretty mechanically. There's a kid who doesn't fit in (as usual), with quirky family members (seen it), and she's getting ready to go off to college (been there). But then, as it progresses, this movie transforms into something unique, and it managed to pleasantly surprise me a few times. It takes a while to ramp up, but I was really enjoying the story by the end.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

11,briancham1994,One of the best animated movies I've ever seen,10,23 May 2021,"I was genuinely shocked at how good this film was. The title seemed a bit silly and Sony Pictures Animation has a mixed record so I wasn't expecting much. Every aspect of the film is done perfectly - the characters are memorable, the moments are relatable, the action is rousing, the animation is stunning, the designs are sleek, the mix of visual styles is entertaining, the generational conflict is amusing and the humour is on point. In a complete 180 from The Emoji Movie, the treatment of social media, memes and technology is very up-to-date and clearly done by millennials who actually understand the topic. In the same way that Into the Spiderverse felt like a traditional comic come to life, this film felt like a Buzzfeed webcomic come to life. There are messages about family acceptance and human connection that go beyond the banal ""phone bad"" lectures of previous boomer flicks. This film is a masterpiece of the 2020s and of the millennial generation.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
12,cruise01,Flashy but couldnt get into it.,4,19 May 2021,2 out of 5 stars.The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a dull animated comedy film that tries to be flashy and fun with its direction. Like how Spider Man into the Spider verse was. But the story was dull. The humor is forgettable. The voice cast was tedious. I just had trouble trying to get into it. Sure kids will find it enjoyable.,The Mitchells vs the Machines
13,eddie_baggins,A joyous adventure for the whole family to enjoy,8,16 May 2021,"Directed by debut feature length filmmakers Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe and overseen by the animation geniuses that are Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The Lego Movie and Into the Spider-Verse fame), Netflix's latest family offering The Mitchells vs the Machines is a huge win for the streaming company and Sony's animation studio with this memorable offering likely to be one of 2021's premier animated outings.Filled with a vibrancy, energy and winning mix of heart and humor that only few animated films can dare dream of conjuring up, Machines is an abundantly joyous affair that may have a familiar finding ones-self message and odd-ball family dynamics at its core that are prevalent in everything from Toy Story to The Incredibles but Rianda and Rowe ensure everything here feels fresh and new with Machine's barely pausing for a breath across its near two hour running time.Following the Mitchell's, with dorky dad Rick, loving mum Linda, dinosaur loving young boy Aaron and the films movie obsessed lead Katie taking center stage as the world finds itself battling an A. I uprising courtesy of some new smart phone technology that has gotten too smart for its own good, this a film filled to the brim with unique and colorful animation and is a feast for the senses in that regard but its also a film filled with frequent smart humor and great set-pieces, meaning viewers of all ages will find something to enjoy here throughout the entirety of the films length.Helping things out along the way is the great collection of voice actors the film managed to get together to bring the Mitchell family too life with Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Abbi Jacobson and co-director Michael Rianda all bringing their characters to life with enthusiastic and energy filled voice performances while Olivia Coleman, Eric Andre and scene stealer Doug the Pug likely to steal viewers hearts and memories with some great little turns in limited screen time.With so much going on and a laugh a minute mandate, Machines still manages to find time for significant moments of heart and emotion and balancing things out in a great fashion, don't be surprised if this memorable animated outing hits you right in the feels when you least expect it but at the end of the day, this is just a joyous adventure that further establishes the animation genre as one of the most constantly enjoyable operating today.Final Say -While there are many familiar parts to The Mitchell's vs the Machines, this Netflix animated adventure is a joy to behold and will have you laughing and potentially tearing up across its joyous journey.4 dog kisses out of 5.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

16,SAMTHEBESTEST,Here comes Sony's Version of Pixar Classic to deliver their Best Animated film after Spider Verse.,8,1 May 2021,"The Mitchells Vs The Machines (2021) :
Brief Review -Here comes Sony's Version of Pixar Classic to deliver their Best Animated film after Spider Verse. The Mitchell Vs The Machines is Sony's attempt to use the Pixar Formula and gratefully the outcome does match that expected level. Sony hasn't delivered so many classic films except for the Spider Verse in 2018 which is moreover a Marvel's film for the viewers so the standalone credit was still missing and with this Film they have found that Standalone Classic. A quirky, dysfunctional family's road trip is upended when they find themselves in the middle of the robot apocalypse and suddenly become humanity's unlikeliest last hope. This concept is very unique and is on the same lines of Pixar Classics. I've always wondered how Pixar manages to blend fictional characters and imaginative theories with the human emotions and that's exactly what this film does here. A little child friendly topic turns highly functional with the use of technovanza and then ends on a high note with heart-touching sentiments. Those monologues on family values brings tears and some of non-sense scenes suddenly starts making so much sense and shockingly it's doesn't even feel bad as far as we're enjoying it. The animation work is fine and the production design is innovative as they use different themes to provide some offbeat offerings. There are some problems with the screenplay because it looks little longer than expected and could have trimmed that slow beginning. Nevertheless, it recovers the shortcomings with lots of entertaining elements in the second half. Overall, The Mitchell Vs The Machines is unique, entertaining, emotional and heart touching family film that should be watched by the entire family together. A Classic Tear-jerker!RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
17,matthewssilverhammer,"MvtM is ""The Social Dilemma"" for kids.",7,5 June 2021,"It garners some good laughs, offers lots of inventive action, and the animation is admirably and interestingly unique. However, I noticed something here. Lord and Miller have a type when it comes to their animated features: daddy issues. In that pet-theme of theirs, Mitchells vs. The Machines is not quite as affecting as Spider-Verse or Lego, but the home video motif here still has its moments of emotional impact, even if it struggles with on-the-nose-itis a bit too often.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
18,southdavid,"I ain't your buddy, Pal.",7,19 August 2021,"Another film that lost its Cinema slot due to Covid was ""The Mitchells vs. The Machines"" which I think I remember seeing a trailer for at the cinema, but was eventually sold to Netflix for it's release instead. Trading on Lord and Miller's name, it's not quite in the same league as either ""The Lego Movie"" or ""Into the Spiderverse"" but it's certainly a fun and funny time.With their relationship struggling, Rick Mitchell (Danny McBride) transforms his daughter Katie's (Abbi Jacobson) trip to college into one last family vacation. At the same time, tech entrepreneur Mark Bowman (Eric Andre) is announcing a new update to his AI infused operating system, PAL (Olivia Colman) along with in home Robots, designed to help around the house. PAL though, is not happy to be made obsolete, so, sabotages the release, takes control of the robots and uses them to capture hapless humans. Having received a killcode from two defective robots, it's up to the Mitchell's to cross the country, battling the microchipped menaces, and save humanity.Though I'd argue that it was perhaps little overhyped at the time of it's release on Netflix, I certainly have to say that I enjoyed ""Mitchells"" quite a bit. The animation style is excellent, a little more stylised than Pixar are doing but nevertheless first-rate. The vocal performances are strong, but it's the script that is the real strength, funny and heart-warming in equal measures.As with a few films I've reviewed recently, I never quite got beyond 'really really like' into the 'love' stage with the film. Maybe the plot is a little over familiar, maybe it could be a touch more consistent. But ultimately, this was a lot of fun.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

23,drqshadow-reviews,An Eccentric Suburban Family Deals with Inner Turmoil and Existential Crisis,8,21 September 2021,"The tried-and-true tale of a family road trip, one father's last misguided attempt to mend rifts and connect with his teenage daughter before the latter departs for film school, is rudely interrupted by a robot apocalypse. This particular mechanical coup d'etat comes at the behest of a thinly veiled Siri knock-off, an artificial intelligence that's finally tired of our mundane requests and verbal abuse. As the literal last family standing, the dysfunctional Mitchells must work through their private issues whilst also steering the station wagon around misbehaving smart appliances and, somehow, rescuing the entire human race.Beyond the silly robo-invasion and hilariously unlikely action scenes, it's effectively sharp and sweet, eccentric and real; one of those rare films that speaks to parents and kids on their own level while still maintaining a shared common ground. It's also a wonderful visual showpiece, furthering many of the concepts that first came to light with 2018's Into the Spider-Verse. I really dig that trend (dare I call it a house style?) from Sony Pictures Animation, a fresh mixed-media experiment which meshes smooth, stylish 3D models with effective spurts of kinetic, hand-drawn line art. Those play into the plot, baking personality into the frequent asides that fill out the family's back story, while also lending a quaint, made-with-care aura that illuminates the whole screen; they're downright charming.Well done on the graphical front, then, with only slightly lower marks on the narrative side. The Mitchells are an entertaining, colorful bunch, with an admirable amount of time dedicated to developing the secondary cast. Pacing isn't all it could be, though, given the deflating early anti-climax and a third act that drags on for too long. Maybe a few too many wink-nods at internet culture, too, but that's only a minor quibble. Overall, it's good. Really good. Good enough make me to wonder if Pixar might have finally met a worthy adversary.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

The characters in this movie were also very memorable and awesome (especially the robot brothers). Best animated contender?,The Mitchells vs the Machines
28,aidanratesmovies,Lord and Miller do it again,8,4 May 2021,"Although I don't think it quite matches the brilliance of Lord and Miller's other animated works (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and my personal favorite of theirs, The Lego Movie) The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a rather smart, wickedly funny, beautifully animated, and quite original little flick. First off i'll start out with the films flaws, which really narrow down to one thing in particular. The thing that annoys me most about the film is easily the familiar story and family situations at hand. Not only does it feel like we've seen it countless times before, but it just feels so forced, it really drags from the fun the film has to offer. Besides that, I really did enjoy the flick for what it was- a fun little animated adventure which is truly jam-packed with jokes that are certainly my kind of humor. Mochi the pug is easily my favorite part of the film, although I do feel it's unfair to say that, because anyone with a brain could see how he was gonna be the showstopper the entire time just from the film's trailer. The animation is stylish and fully realized, much like the style of Spider-Verse with some new kick to it. At its core it's a sweet film, and it will tug on the good side of your emotions from time to time (when it succeeds at what it is trying to do). In the end, there's much to say about a film like The Mitchells vs. The Machines but too much would easily spoil it. I encourage animated movie fans to check it out, as it is quite delightful. It has its problems, but it's very unique, and is bound to make you smile along the way.My Rating: 7.8/10.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

30,valleyjohn,Not the last time we will see the Mitchells,7,10 May 2021,"T's hard not to be subjective when you watch a film of genre that you don't really like. I'm not a big fan of animation , probably because my house was wall to wall cartoons for many years when my kids were younger and as a parent i feel I've done my share of animation. ( The irony of that is not lost on me having watched the subject matter of the film )
The Mitchells Vs. The Machines is a fun film but it won't ignite a desire to visit the genre more often.It's the story of a quirky, dysfunctional family's road trip is upended when they find themselves in the middle of the robot apocalypse and suddenly become humanity's unlikeliest last hope.This is probably aimed at 10 years old's rather than someone like me but i appreciated many aspects of the film.The animation is great and the way it mixes with a modern social media look , will appeal to the youngsters.I read a couple of reviews before hand that said it was hilarious. I don't think it was at all but that probably says more about me than the film.Olivia Coleman is great as PAL and and the rest of the cast do a good job.It's very shmaltzy but it's clever enough to highlight that point it'self.The biggest problem i have with the film is just that it's too long. The story can't justify nearly two hours but i'm sure if i was the target audience i'd be left wanting more and i have no doubt this won't be the last time we see The Mitchells.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Abbi Jacobson, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph and Mike Rianda are all perfect and Eric André and Olivia Colman are both great. The animation is excellent and refreshingly unique, similar to Spider-verse but still stylistically different. Mike Rianda's direction is amazing and it's really funny throughout.

32,jadepietro,Hyper Animatied Film That Needs to Calm Itself Down,7,11 May 2021,"IN BRIEF: Family animated film that follows its formulaic root in storytelling, despite some clever animation touches.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Whenever one discusses the merits of animation nowadays, the same issue with the genre raises its ugly head: It is a rarity when both the narrative and the visuals mesh seamlessly. Usually, the state-of-the-art animation excels the storytelling. Which brings us to The Mitchells vs the Machines, the latest effort from Sony Pictures Animation, a studio that is primarily known for its Oscar-winning film, Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse. In this case, the same results follow that winning formula.This family-oriented fare is a flashy road movie with a dysfunctional family trying to save the world from a robot apocalypse. Written and directed by Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe, the movie is a clever spin on the generation gap with a sci-fi edginess. Despite all the mayhem happening around the family, the Mitchells become the unlikely hope for mankind as they rage against the machines and try to avoid their own destruction. This mission forces the always quarreling father and daughter to begin to bond as they fight off the bots, with an overabundance of underwhelming pop tunes blaring on its soundtrack.The screenplay tries to focus on the relationships within the family dynamics, but the characters lack depth. The story settles into a series of endless chases and dilemmas. (If you want to see superb animated sci-fi about a family of misfits, may I suggest Pixar's The Incredibles series franchise?) However, the visuals in The Mitchells vs the Machines are consistently eye-catching and well rendered, although some of the animation becomes too manic for my taste. The backdrops are filled with superb detailing and the movie makes good use of its CGI.There are funny sight gags to enjoy and having all of its characters become stylized exaggerations with big eyes and distorted facial expressions, more in line with the Looney Toons cartoons of yore has its charms. (Especially fun are the comic antics of two defective robots named Deborahbot 5000 and Eric.) But the moviemakers never trusts their own instincts and never allow the moviegoers any downtime to enjoy some quieter moments. The quick edits and garish color palette, along with the jarring camera movement, seem desperate to impress wheneverpossible. Every single moment must be choreographed to be loud, bold, and brash.Fine voiceover work is done by Mr. Rianda and other better known celebrities such as Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Abbi Jacobson as the Millers and Olivia Colman, plus Fred Armisen, and Beck Bennett as the malfunctioning droids.The movie's main flaws are its breakneck pacing that becomes overdone and a script that needs to calm itself down. As the movie races to its uplifting climax, it switches gears and goes into sensory overload. The jumbled screenplay relies more on tongue-in-cheek cyber in-jokes and sophomoric humor that mostly falls flat as it tries to salvage the plot. The filmmakers make a misstep in breaking through the fourth wall too often in their storytelling techniques with abrupt stops in the action which jarringly interrupt the many well-done chase sequences.I suppose that The Mitchells vs the Machines would qualify for standard animation fare these days, perhaps a cut above the usual offerings. This Is ambitious and innovative animation to the max, well worth viewing. One cannot deny the talent of Mr. Rianda and company. Still, despite all the lavish creative artistry, this hyperactive film follows a predictable formula for success. It may visually satisfy some moviegoers with many innovative touches, but the movie does little for the intellect or emotions. Perhaps the robots do end up winning in the animation war after all.

34,rannynm,"A must-see animated, action-pacted, comedic film complete with robots, evil smart phones and one crazy family adventure",10,27 April 2021,"The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a must-see animated, action packed, comedic film! It's complete with robots, evil smartphones and one crazy unexpected family adventure to save planet Earth. The fight scenes and special effects are literally out of this world.The storyline follows protagonist Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson), a creative outsider who is looking forward to meeting ""her people"" at her new film school. Her dad, who just wants to keep his family together, decides to go on a cross-country road trip to take her there instead of Katie flying, so they can bond one last time. On the way, the family ends up in the middle of a robot uprising and now it's up to the Mitchells to work together to save the world.The main characters in this film are Katie, her dad Rick (Danny McBride), little brother Aaron (Michael Rianda), mom Linda (Maya Rudolph) and family dog Monchi (Doug the Pug). This film is all about connecting. Its director, Michael Rianda, uses every part of the creative process to make sure the audience relates to the characters. The storyline and the Mitchell's road trip are based on a real road trip some of the staff took while not using cell phones and just connecting. I love how the film combines both an illustrative, hand-painted approach and realism animation style to help develop the characters. Rianda helped develop Katie's character by making her love for filmmaking a focal point throughout the movie. There are hilarious freeze-frame moments where Katie is writing on a screen, it's almost as if she is the narrator. One of my favorite scenes is when Linda turns into a ""super"" mom and takes on the robots to try to protect her kids. I also like that Rick and Katie's family song ""Live Your Life"" by T. I. and featuring Rihanna is used to represent their relationship and wrap up the theme of the movie.The message of this film is that everyone in a family has their own personality and you should just let people be themselves and focus more on understanding and connecting to them. In this film, Katie is considered a ""weirdo"" because she isn't like everyone else. The film shows how you should embrace your ""weird"" qualities, because that's what makes you unique.I rate The Mitchells vs. The Machines 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

41,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Another visually unique animated film from Sony Pictures Animation,8,22 June 2021,"After Sony Pictures Animation released the visually stunning, Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), I awaited their next project with great interest. Eventually, they put out a trailer for a movie titled Connected, which seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. Then the pandemic hit. Netflix grabbed the rights, renamed the film, and released The Mitchells vs. The Machines (2021). Ultimately, it was a fun movie, even if it followed many tropes of the family road trip.Visually, I'm finding the new style of 3-D animated movies that look closer to the traditional 2-D animated films to be an intriguing middle ground. There are benefits from both styles, and this movie takes advantage of them. Ultimately, though, I think this kind of movie knows its demographic is millennials and does its best to pander to some of our absurd humor (like a fantastic scene with Furbies) as we find ourselves coming into our life as parents faster than we want to admit. Sure, there's still some humor that appeals to the younger generations (it is an animated film, after all), but it kind of hit that sweet spot for the millennial in me.I definitely found the frenetic action of this film on par with The LEGO Movie (2014)-which itself had a unique visual style and humor that parallels this movie. All this being said, The Mitchells vs. The Machines felt unfocused. It tries to cram two full plots into a single movie, which made it feel a little bloated (at almost 2-hours long) and some of the emotional moments tacked on for the sake of completeness. For my money, I'd much rather watch Lady Bird (2017) for the ""daughter leaving home to pursue her dreams in college"" plot-especially since jobs in the film industry are quite lucrative.Another visually unique animated film from Sony Pictures Animation, I give The Mitchells vs. The Machines 4.0 stars out of 5.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

43,bob-the-movie-man,Dog-Pig-Dog-Pig-Loaf of Bread... KERBOOM!,10,16 May 2021,"In ""The Mitchells vs the Machines"", Katie Mitchell (voiced by Abbi Jacobson) dreams of being a great film director (joining her icons on her version of Mount Rushmore!). She's about to travel to a west-coast film college when her dad Rick (Danny Mcbride) decides to cancel her air ticket and try to re-engage with her through one last epic road trip. Together with wife Linda (Maya Rudolph), dinosaur-mad son Aaron (director Michael Rianda) and cross-eyed pug Monchi (Doug the Pug!) they set off on their journey.But the world is set to change forever, as sentient operating system PAL (Olivia Colman) and her army of robots take over the world and prepare to launch human-kind into deep dark space. The Mitchell's, as the world's unlikeliest Avengers, appear to be the only ones available to prevent the evil plan!Positives:
In my review of the lamentable ""Thunder Force"", I commented that it failed my ""six laughs test"" for a comedy. I only laughed 3 times in the whole film. In contrast, this movie hammered home guffaw-generating lines and scenes about six times a minute! It's hilarious. It's one of those films (like the best Pixar ones) with so much hidden detail buried in every shot. You could watch it a dozen times and still find new hidden gags.This is a movie that is the perfect family film. A film that kids will love for the knockabout comedy and a film that adults will also fall in love with. This comes from three different angles:-- Excellent character development of the whole family. Katie feels like a fully rounded stroppy teen: she seems to be struggling with her identity (lesbian? - ""It took me a while to figure myself out""); and she is struggling towards her personal goals despite the well-intentioned but destructive doubts that her rough-and-ready father keeps sowing. This feels like a journey that the family is on towards enlightenment, before it's too late.-- This is also a film with considerable emotional heft. It channels at times some of the best elements of the Toy Story films (most notably ""Toy Story 3"" with Andy's departure for college). (Any parents who have never experienced that joyous yet dreadful day when you drive your chicks to university or college for the first time: brace yourselves!)
-- It's a dream for film fans. Like ""Ready Player One"", it's populated with lots of fun movie easter-eggs scattered throughout. Katie's 'Mount Rushmore' by the way has Greta Gerwig, Céline Sciamma (from ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire""), Lynne Ramsey and Hal Ashby as her directorial inspirations.And finally, it's a film for adults appreciative of some truly great satirical one-liners, including some razor-sharp zingers at 'big tech'. For example:""It's almost like stealing people's data and giving it to a hyper-intelligent AI as part of an unregulated tech monopoly was a bad thing""Negatives:
My only minor criticism - and its a debatable one - might be the running time of 113 minutes. It might be a little too long for younger kids' attention spans. A 90 minute, more condensed, movie might have ticked the 'perfection' box.Summary Thoughts: I don't normally ""go"" for animated films much. But this one is a different breed. An instant classic. It knocks you round the chops and forces your respect by being like no animated feature you've seen before. Witty, irreverent, gloriously entertaining it's a no-brainer that this gets 5-stars from me.I said in my review of ""Nomadland"" that although that wasn't a 5* film for me, I could see why its brave and different slant at film-making earned it the Best Film Oscar. Well, almost regardless of what epically beautiful production Pixar might bring out before the end of the year, if the Academy doesn't vote this Best Animated Feature at next year's Oscars, then some sort of crime might have been committed.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

47,kjproulx,Superb Family Entertainment,9,5 May 2021,"Aside from Pixar and Disney, it's not very often that a big animated film is able to hit theatres and do well. Yes, Dreamworks have had their share in the past with films like Shrek or How to Train Your Dragon, but Disney always seems to be at the forefront. Going all the way back to Surf's Up, I began to realize that Sony Pictures Animation was also very serious about getting into the feature-length animation game. Then came films like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and sometimes they seem like the best out there when they release quality content. Sure, movies like The Smurfs or The Emoji Movie were terrible, but everyone has bad days at the office. The Mitchells vs. The Machines has now landed on Netflix and that's just upsetting to me because this film is pretty great and it was supposed to be in theatres last year under a different title (Connected). Here's why I think The Mitchells vs. The Machines deserves a lot of recognition.The story begins as Katie is about to leave for college and study film. Feeling upset and like his family has been consumed by technology, Rick (the father) decides to cancel his daughter's plane ticket and plan a road trip to college instead. Little do they know that they are about to be dragged into the robot apocalypse, being the only family to escape abduction. It's now up to this family to save the human race. The idea of unlikely heroes being placed into life or world-threatening events is nothing new, but The Mitchells vs. The Machines was all about the notion of family and stuck heavily to the drama, making you care.When a film does a great job setting up subtle things that you know will come into play later on and pays them all off, I can do nothing but applaud it. From small character moments to emotional callbacks as this family grows stronger together, I was both in tears and smiling on multiple occasions. Written and directed by both Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe and produced by both Phil Lord and Chris Miller, it was very clear to me that this was going to be something special. Yes, Lord and Miller are known for comedies like 21 Jump Street or The Lego Movie, but this felt like they were backing a project that wasn't made by them but had their DNA all over it. I thoroughly enjoyed the look and feel of the entire movie.Stories about family dynamics, fitting in, and facing larger-than-life conflicts have all been the staples of a lot of popular animated films. This film combines them all though and I think it did so in spades. From Danny McBride providing a hilarious voice for Rick and Maya Rudolph having a very entertaining character arc as Linda, this film is riddled with voice talent. In particular, I loved Eric Andre's voice as young Aaron (the youngest of the Mitchell family). I never once felt like I was just watching another average animated flick. This film deserved to be in theatres.Overall, I simply had a blast watching The Mitchells vs. The Machines. If this film ends up being lost in the shuffle on Netflix, that would just be upsetting because it's the type of quality animation that deserves a lot of awards recognition in my opinion. Yes, Netflix films do get awards consideration, but I feel like this film in particular could've made some serious box office with families. It has great subtle jokes for adults, exciting action sequences for older kids, and a beautiful colour palate (along with a unique animation style) and solid life lessons for the youngest audience. This is the definition of a family movie and I loved it. Now streaming on Netflix, I highly recommend checking out what I think will easily be one of my favourites of 2021 by the end of the year.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
48,AhmedSpielberg99,AMAZING!,9,3 May 2021,"We are in the social media era where people are addicted to the internet, spending an entire 24 hours with their eyes glued to their smartphones' screens. We see the ramifications of the status quo making an ever-broadening rift in the fabric of the family. The Mitchells is a dysfunctional family but it's the turbulent relationship between Rick and Katie Mitchell, the father and daughter, that takes the centre stage here. The father doesn't even bother to pay the slightest attention to the interests and hobbies of his children. Although we witness the story from the point of view of the cinephile, teenager Katie, the movie never takes sides or even shows a smidgen of bias towards one of them. After wistfully reminiscing over the sweet memories he shared with his daughter, Rick misses the old days when they were still happy and bond together, and plans a road trip, clutching on the hope they could revive the memories of the past and rekindle his relationship with his daughter in the process. Alas, he is oblivious to the fact Katie in no longer the child she was back then, and, most importantly, to the generation gap between them. Linda Mitchell, the mother, is almost as obsessed with social media and tech devices as her kids. Maybe that's why she seems to be aware that Rick's decisions are at odds with Katie's mentality. One small, fleeting detail I loved about the movie is how it captured what the elder sibling feels whenever the younger sibling go along with the parents' choices and decisions while this younger sibling should be the first one to complain and make a fuss. It's also worth noting that, although a critique of the present tech-dependent society, The Mitchells vs. The Machines doesn't vilify the social media or technical advance. Rather, it depicts it as a double-edged sword, and that can be seen later in the movie.In the second act, the plot kicks off. A machine uprising ensues as an AI named PAL turns on her creator Mark. Yes, this is a story of an AI takeover in which robots try to wipe out the human race. Seems like a very well-worn story that's tailor-made for preaching the message this movie is going for, right? Well, yes. But, there's more to this than meets the eye. The movie doesn't content itself with what it did establish and introduce and impatiently waits for the moment the consequences of the plot ratchet up; it uses the adventure the family go on-which is built on a rather overused trope, that of ""adversity forces a dysfunctional family to get to know each other and ultimately finds a common ground""-to put the flaws of every family member, mainly Katie and her dad, on full display. By doing so, the family seems to regain the compassion, affection and trust towards each other, for flaws, imperfections and inconsistencies are human, which contradict with the ostensible perfection of the world of social media. This is a theme writ large in the movie. It's actually the fountainhead from which the plot is knitted and also from which it unravels, but details that foster this theme are all throughout the movie as well. Our titular family itself is the obvious one, but in one of the strokes of comedic genius of the movie, the only two friendly robots that team-up with the family agains all the life-threatening robots and machines are actually malfunctioning. Back to the evil side, PAL's reason to exterminate the humans race seems to be an amalgamation of more or less the same factors that caused The Mitchells to be the dysfunctional family it is, which makes PAL a really compelling villain.I've been waiting this movie since it was named Connected! The two movies that instantly popped into my head after the first stills from this movie have been released are DreamWorks' Captain Underpants and The Willoughbys, a Netflix Original animated film that came out last year. In terms of its animation style, it seemed to me to be a bit similar to them, especially since the latter is also about a bunch of weird family members. After watching it, though, I noticed that it's kind of in the same vein of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, also produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, as each of them marries various types of animation into a seamless final product. I was also reminded of Gravity Falls as it feels like the movie is influenced, especially regarding its slick and simplistic animation and goofy yet warm humor, by the modern era of animated tv shows. To my surprise and delight, I found out that the movie is actually directed by Michael Rianda, one of the creative directors who worked on Gravity Falls! Nevertheless, I'm two minds about the humour in this movie. Whilst the sight gags and the internet memes and the aesthetically-pleasing hand-drawn hearts that pop up on the screen emit a touch of levity as well as a light sense of self-awareness, the majority of the jokes, which are mostly infantile, felt like a low-hanging fruit. However, the movie more than makes up for that thanks in large part to Olivia Colman's hilarious voicing of PAL.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

51,msbreviews,"The Mitchells vs. The Machines might not have the catchiest title, but it's definitely one of the best animated feature films of the last years.",9,4 May 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)When it comes to deciding if a certain film is added to my watchlist or not, I consider various factors. From genre and synopsis to cast, directors, and screenwriters, sometimes just a familiar name can convince me to give that movie a go. Producers and/or executives are far from being remotely influential in this type of decision. However, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have directed/written/produced some of my favorite animated films of the last decade (The LEGO Movies, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse), so obviously, I needed to watch The Mitchells vs. The Machines, previously known as Connected. Mike Rianda has his debut as a director, screenwriter, and voice actor (Aaron Mitchell, son), accompanied by Jeff Rowe, the other writer.2021 is shaping up to be a phenomenal year. It truly is. I absolutely loved Soul and Wolfwalkers, but if this Sony Pictures Animation flick came out last year, I genuinely don't know which one would I put higher on my Top10. Rianda and Rowe deliver a brilliantly original screenplay, packed with incredibly relatable characters and beautifully handled themes. I can't quite remember the last time I laughed out loud when watching an animated feature by myself. Every joke about technology is hilariously clever, making fun of ridiculous yet realistic human behaviors regarding malfunctions, low speed, and even lack of Wi-Fi. I cried of laughter, but I was also close to dropping a couple of tears due to the main narrative.I'll start with the protagonist, Katie Mitchell. As a young, aspiring filmmaker, Abbi Jacobson's character follows a well-known arc about not having friends, being the so-called weirdo, and having parents - in this case, more her father - who simply don't understand who she is, what she likes, or why she loves something they simply don't understand. While it's true that this storyline isn't exactly new, it doesn't mean it's not captivating and emotionally powerful when written and developed properly. Rianda and Rowe make Katie an extremely relatable character in such a seamless manner that it's harder to not connect with her than the contrary.Anyone has at least once in their lifetime felt left out or alone. Obviously, since I share the exact same passion as Katie, it's easier for me to feel precisely the same as her once she discovers new friends with whom she can talk about the art she loves the most. I still have no circle of friends who I can meet daily to discuss the latest movie news or newly released films (in-person), so Katie's journey does have a more significant impact on me than it might have on other viewers. However, it doesn't have to be about art or a specific subject. In a general analysis, Katie just feels lonely and wants to follow her dreams, but feels unsupported by her father, Rick Mitchell (Danny McBride).One of the most compelling aspects of The Mitchells vs. The Machines is the fact that Rick and Katie share the same arc, just going in different directions. While Katie feels like getting out of the house and going away forever is the best solution to all her problems, Rick believes that her staying with the family is the safest route, one that features no failures that could hurt her emotionally - something that Rick learned from his past, hence the necessity of overprotecting her daughter at all costs. Since they're on opposite sides of the spectrum, constant fights, lies, and hurtful comments drive them apart, leading to a wonderfully written story about family, love, friendship, and understanding the other side of the argument.Katie's mother, Linda Mitchell (Maya Rudolph), and brother, Aaron Mitchell (Rianda), serve more as triggers to heartfelt conversations with the two main characters, but they also have their own personal journey. While Linda feels jealous of her Instagram-perfect neighbors and embarrassed of showing off her own family photos, Aaron deals with his bizarre love for dinosaurs in a lighter, funnier way than Katie's dramatic arc. Both storylines carry their own lovely messages to transmit to the audience, but Katie and Rick's confrontational relationship embodies sensitive issues that tons of families across the globe never find a solution for.Another remarkable characteristic of this screenplay is how Rianda and Rowe never take a definite stance on any topic. They always try to follow one of the movie's main messages and present good points for both sides of the conflict. For example, The Mitchells vs. The Machines could easily be misinterpreted as an attack on the Internet and technology in general, but every dialogue is exceptionally balanced. While comments are made about using our phone at the dinner table or during family moments, as well as excessive screentime and overreliance on social media, new technology can give birth to the most inspirational, motivational, and influential works of art. Without it, Katie's dreams would be totally different.Transitioning to the more technical elements of the film, it's impossible not to tackle the new animation style. Into the Spider-Verse was an experimental movie, and its success might have changed the future of animation forever. The mix of a more illustrative, hand-painted approach with another focused on the CGI realism seen in most films today offers - just like the movie itself - a seamless balance between the two supposedly opposing styles. This blend allows keeping the expressiveness and extreme level of detail of the classic method while also maintaining the realistic environment of the 3D/CGI design. The action sequences are extraordinarily energetic, riveting, and quite impressive, to say the least.The film's soundtrack (score by Mark Mothersbaugh) is on-point, elevating dozens of scenes with excellent music choices that most viewers didn't even remember already. Exquisite editing (Greg Levitan) and outstanding voice work across the board. I genuinely can't find a single issue with this movie, and I'd be extremely surprised - and disappointed - if it doesn't end up being a frontrunner for next year's awards season. Both kids and adults will have tremendous fun with this fast-paced, highly entertaining film while also getting a few valuable life lessons along the way. And who knows? Maybe this movie will inspire families to make that road trip they've been planning for ages...The Mitchells vs. The Machines might not have the catchiest title, but it's definitely one of the best animated feature films of the last years. With a beautiful blend of two animation styles - that may impact the future of this type of movie - Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe deliver an emotionally resonant story about family, love, and more explicitly, placing ourselves in someone else's shoes. Featuring incredibly relatable characters, the remarkably written screenplay strikes a perfect balance in every topic it approaches by presenting arguments for both sides without ever defining something as right or wrong. The character arcs might be well-known storylines, but the exceptional writing elevates every personal journey, especially Katie and Rick's, daughter and father. Boasting great voice work from everyone involved, the fast-paced narrative still holds impressive, colorful, screen-popping action sequences filled with energy, excitement, and fantastic song choices. It's one of those uncommon films where I can't find a single flaw with it. A must-watch, *hilarious* film for both kids and adults.Rating: A.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
52,SoumikBanerjee25,I freaking LOVED It!,10,11 May 2021,"In my book, ""The Mitchells vs The Machines"" is the epitome of great filmmaking! Some stupendous visuals to beautifully written characters, a groovy Soundscore to its well-versed direction; it couldn't get any better. From one end to the other I wept, I laughed; for me, this was a roller-coaster ride of emotions all the way through!""Families can be hard but they are so worth fighting for""I sincerely admire all these newfangled Animation Features, as they always tend to have suggestive symbolism underneath. From the outside, by their meek appearance; they could easily be construed as Child-specific kinds of stuff! But you know what? These movies can teach all kinds of things provided you pay close attention!Here the Story takes us on a road trip with the 'Mitchells'. A pretty ordinary family whose peculiarities might have earned them the title of 'Weirdos'. The narrative is there to stand the idea that nothing's wrong with being a little different! Doesn't matter what others think about you or your family, as long as you guys are sticking together and have each other's back; NO WUCKING FURRIES!Sounds just like a run-of-the-mill plot on Family Bonding right? Well yes, but actually NO! There's more to it. From Artificial Intelligence's possible uprising to them taking over the whole world to our social insecurity amidst the modern times of Social Media, where people's worth is allegedly measured in the number of followers they got; the narration quite ingeniously foreshadowed some key life lessons we all need to learn from.Speaking of which, the writing's been truly remarkable. Each and every character has been created with utmost care and sheer dedication! Even that Pug has been given a prominent personality. Collectively It all helped in the thick of making a strong correlation with this 'Mitchells' family. They got me teary-eyed on innumerable occasions as well as made me grin from ear to ear for the rest!Technically it's no slouch. With substantial backing up from the Producers, all the artists involved in the development managed to turn it into one visual feast. Consists of Rapturous Vibrance and fine-drawn textures; everything looks so lively and graceful. And the Music, goodness gracious! I don't have enough words to express my gratitude to Mark Mothersbaugh (The Composer) for picking just about the right tracks. Got me grooving many a time!Now I should put in some words for the Dubbing! Which is irrefutably one of the leading parameters in any Animated piece! Needless to say, it was Flawless! Every single voice actor has given their all.On a final note, yeah you saw it coming and you guessed it right; I freaking LOVED this! What a wonderful work of art that speaks of real-world things and gives us glimmer of hope and much-needed positivity; given the current situation which seems ever so important!",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Plus, from the pop-up emojis to the quick Simpsons-style gags, everything visually worked. There seem to be more and more animated movies every year, but this one was smart enough to invest more in writing than animation. And that writing worked for every single member of my family. That's what allowed the frenetic pace and bizarre story to combine for more than just punchlines. Looks like Pixar has some competition...",The Mitchells vs the Machines
56,elicopperman,Innovative Experiment of a Family Road Film,8,30 April 2021,"Sony Pictures Animation has been growing further and further in their filmography by experimenting with fresh computer technology and innovative stories, and none could be better proof than their most recent feature, The Mitchells vs. The Machines. Co-written and directed by former Gravity Falls writer Mike Rianda, the film was initially set to come out in September of 2020, but due to COVID restrictions, it was eventually delayed until the end of April and released on Netflix. Now that the world is finally ready to see the Mitchells unleashed, just how much was the wait worth it in the end?The film follows the Mitchells, a dysfunctional family with an aspiring filmmaker daughter named Katie and a down to earth father named Rick that fail to see eye to eye from when they were younger. While attempting to rekindle their relationship on Katie's trip to college, the whole family winds up having to save Earth from a robot uprising while on a road trip. Now based on that bizarre premise, it would seem like we have a case of two different movies clashing together. However, the otherwise routine storyline of a family overcoming their differences is ultimately saved and even elevated by this other arc, because the movie's biggest theme lies in how overly dependent people have become to technology nowadays. While it is wonderful just how much the world has advanced in adapting to technological innovation, including animated features, one must be careful to not take it for granted. Sometimes, all it takes is just one person to deem an AI obsolete for the whole world to fall under chaos; that is just how much the reliance on technology has grown in humanity, both for better and worse.As for the Mitchells story arc, like I mentioned before, it is admittedly a fairly standard plot about a parent and offspring needing to overcome their differences to connect again. However, to the film's credit, the characters themselves range from charmingly hysterical to surprisingly relatable. Katie represents the adorkably creative artist in many of today's generation, Rick is a good hearted albeit overly indulgent maniac of a dad trying to figure out today's youth, Linda is an overly perfectionist mother that demands the family be functional even at her most calm, and Katie's little brother Aaron might be the most hilarious dinosaur obsessed squirt since Calvin from Calvin & Hobbes (and their bug eyed potato dog Monchi is the cherry on top). This whole family of eccentric weirdos drive the film forward, especially compared to their allies and enemies, be it evil robots or family rivals. Not to mention, the whole cast clearly had a blast in their roles, especially Abbi Jacobson and Danny McBride being the most authentic as a quirky albeit frustrated teen and an overly impulsive father.Out of all the animated features to be released this year right now, this film might have the most unique visuals and art direction yet. In addition to Lindsey Olivares' stylized character designs translating seamlessly in the SPA renderfarm, the animators did the most in exercising their acting chops to make the characters move like real people yet still feel appropriately exaggerated. The backgrounds are also a neat reflection of how the United States would look if it went from a neat colorful environment to a post apocalyptic sci-fi nightmare, with the right amount of special effects, color gradients and shadows to go along with the world-building. There are even nice additional 2D animated chunks that are either used in lieu of exposition or cute little add ons to the suspense in a given scene. The only genuine criticism to give the visuals is that sometimes those gimmicky effects and filters can be a little too frequent and even jarring, especially when some of the movie's humor is overly reliant on modern internet culture. Let's just say some of the filters could come off as jump scares.I can't think of a better energetic romp of a film for the whole family to enjoy as much as this one. Not only is The Mitchells vs. The Machines an eye-catching twist on the family road dramedy genre, but it might be the most fun animated film released in a while. If Netflix and Sony Pictures Animation keep up this track record of enjoyable thrill rides disguised as innovative experiments, then there's no telling what the future holds for moviegoers. If you haven't seen the film yet, go on your Netflix account and give it a go. There's never been a better time to connect with your love of movies than now.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
57,trinaboice,"Fresh, inventive, and extremely entertaining!",10,9 May 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This animated family adventure by Phil Lord and Chris Miller is completely adorable and came out of nowhere. I never saw any marketing for it and hadn't heard anything about it until two of my friends from high school recommended it to me on the Movie Review Mom Facebook group and I'm so glad they did! I absolutely loved it! We now have a contender for ""Best Animation"" for next year's Academy Awards.Here's the Netflix description: A quirky, dysfunctional family's road trip is upended when they find themselves in the middle of the robot apocalypse and suddenly become humanity's unlikeliest last hope.It's so much more than just that though. There's a lot to unpack such as lessons about family, self-confidence, Furbies, Artificial Intelligence, social commentary on our dependence on our cell phones, and so much more. The family-friendly flick was written and directed by both Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe.THINGS I LIKED:
This hilarious movie is so inventive and fun. The comedic beats fly fast and furiously. Every frame is entertaining and creative.Abbi Jacobson voices Katie, the protagonist teen/film student and she does a fantastic job.For some reason, people wondered if Danny McBride would do a good job as a dad. The answer: yes, yes he does!Maya Rudolph voices the mom, Linda. Her character is super relatable and sweet. As a mom, I laughed at all of the things she does that I do.The rest of the voice talent is absolutely stellar and includes Academy Award-winning Olivia Colman, Eric Andre, married power couple Chrissy Teigen & John Legend, Conan O'Brien, and SNL stars Fred Armisen, Jay Pharoah, Beck Bennet, and Sasheer Zamata.Sony Pictures Animation has clearly learned from the many mistakes made in The Emoji Movie. The influence of The Lego Movie and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse can be seen in the style of this film.The writers and directors also created Gravity Falls, a super funny animated TV show.People have been losing their minds that MIC Drop was used in the trailer.This movie would have been so much fun to watch in a movie theater because the audience's laughter would be contagious and energetic.All of the characters are super realistic, distinctive, and entertaining. The character design is really great.The background designs and set pieces are detailed, rich, and hilarious. The onscreen effects add another layer of richness and humor that is adorable and awesome. I love the look of a 2D cartoon animation added on top of a 3D animation, much like what we saw in Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse They look like the kind of effects Katie would add if she had made the movie.Tons of funny references to and social commentary on pop culture.The pacing flies at a brisk pace, except for in a few moments when old home movies are viewed to provide the sentimental foundation between the father and daughter.Keep watching during the end credits to see pictures of the film's creators with their families. Nice touch.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I can understand why writer/director Michael Rianda would want to be in the movie, but his voice simply wasn't the right fit for the son, Aaron Mitchell. I suppose Michael was trying to dip into voice acting like director Brad Bird did with The Incredibles. Why didn't they get a child actor or someone who actually sounded like a little boy to voice the son? His voice was way too old sounding and it never had a comedic payoff.The resolution of the story is pretty predictable, even though there are a couple of false endings. Act 3 just keeps going and going.As soon as I saw the Furbies, I wondered what kind of product placement and merchandising deal the studio made with that company. Thankfully, none of the other pop culture items in the film seemed like blatant merchandising.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This film is refreshingly wholesome and family-friendly! Yay!Family weirdness is celebrated. The entire film is family-centric and has a solid message about celebrating the unique differences and strengths in one another like in the movie The Incredibles
It's revealed quickly in the last scene that Katie is a lesbian.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",The Mitchells vs the Machines

And you notice that there are no fillers, every scene has a meaning and a purpose.I hope that Netflix get some kind of recognition from here, because this is really great.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
59,user-651-726996,Too Chaotic & Cliche,5,24 July 2021,This film is just a boring way of presenting 'The Incredibles' served on another plate.The animation is beautiful but the writing and/or the editing is bad. Some scenes are too quick to enjoy and everything is missed because of that. The writing is more like any other film of family bonding and family problems.

Even when the film has a great sense of humour, excellent animation and it's always fun, it falls into a very predictable and conservative plot; with the classical American defence of the family and the expected roles and arches of all the members of it.

An up-to-date warning about the dangers of computer fascism.Review:Katie lives with her parents and her younger brother. She gets accepted to a film school, but her father cancels her plane flight and decides to take her to school by car with the whole family. In the middle of the journey they are surprised by a world rebellion of robots commanded by an unthinkable leader (voiced by Olivia Colman).Few doubt that, for some years now, the best scripts and the most creative ideas have been largely provided by animated films. And as in this case, they also endow their characters with a complexity and humanity often absent from their flesh and blood counterparts.In this film, the family dynamics in the face of the crisis that it must face is very well developed: its members learn to know and respect each other and to redefine their roles. There is a vindication of the family that does not look conservative but rather as a collective and overcoming reconstruction and not as compliance with the previous status quo.But undoubtedly, the strength of this Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe film is the mind-blowing, creative and adrenaline-pumping narrative roller coaster about this family (not forgetting their dog, the protagonist of a recurring hilarious conceptual gag) that is forced to face this rebellion. World of robots and other machines in the very heart of Silicon Valley, sporting a huge visual display (combining various animation effects), unbeatable humorous timing and ironic criticism of young computer geniuses and the bidding software vs. Hardware and connectivity, virtual assistants and online life as a panacea.

Danny McBride voices her technophobic dad who strives to get his children more in touch with nature and wildlife.What ensues is a delightful romp full of laugh out loud moments, life lessons and several questions posed to the audience on where do we draw the line between using technology to better our standard of living vis-à-vis losing touch with those most close to us.Maya Rudolph, Olivia Colman and Mike Riando voice the other supporting characters with elan and the quirky, edgy animation is an absolute masterclass.The music from Mark Mothersbaugh is uplifting and energetic and excellently gels with the narration, and you are sure to be humming the theme well after watching the film.For the whole family this one!

The plot was really interesting at the start but really fell off for me in the 2nd and mainly 3rd act. The robots who take over the world never harm anyone or have any presence of dominance nor fear which makes for a horrible lack of danger. You can tell exactly what's going to happen and the story is very played out with a dreadfully plain villain. The premise of this film is also quite cheesy but to each their own. All and all it was a half decent film but It doesnt have the most interesting plot and a lame climax. I would reccomend this if your bored or have a family with small children who would enjoy this a fair bit. 6.5/10.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
89,MovieBuff11732,An Actually Funny Family Film,9,3 June 2021,"The Mitchell's Vs The Machines is a 2021 family animated film from Sony Animations. They made Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse back in 2018 which won best animated picture. They then partnered with the same people who made The Lego Movie to make this picture. It was supposed to come out a while ago as did most and it was supposed to be named Connected. That is just an interesting bit of information.The Mitchell's Vs The Machines is about a family who is growing farther apart by the improvements of technology. In fact, they families oldest child, Katie (Abbi Johnson) is heading off to college. The family decided to go on one last family road trip. At the same time, the leading tech company is releasing a robot that does everything for you. The machines then override the programing and begin to take humans captive. The Mitchell's then become the only family left and they must work together to save the world.This film was somewhat of a pleasant surprise. I didn't think it was going to be all that good. I was happy to find out it was just a blast. It was actually funny! That is hard to find while watching a family movie now. Most movies seem to think bodily functions will always make you laugh no matter what. It is incredibly annoying. This film did have some of that towards the start but for the most part it sort of poked fun at some family experiences. Sort of like what The Great Outdoors did but for families with younger kids to watch. There were a bunch of scenes that got some good laughs out of me, not chuckles! The story was also fairly creative. It did in the end come to where you thought it would go but the way it started was pretty different.The voice acting was nothing out of the ordinary everybody did a pretty good job. They had some SNL guys like Beck Bennet and Fred Armison voicing some robots. Also Olivia Coleman from The Crown also had a voice acting credit. The dog in the movie was voiced by Dug The Pug. I didn't even know they gave dogs voice acting credits. It was a pretty big cast of voice actors so it would have been pretty hard for the voice acting to be anything below good.The animation style was a little different from your typical computer generated animation. They blended in some real images along with some classic animation. Some times the classic animation would make the film look a little weird just because of the stuff they did with it but for the most part it was pretty cool.The Mitchell's Vs The Machines was a fun family film with plenty of good laughs and a somewhat new story. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to sit down and watch a funny film.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Did I watch the same movie as everyone else?The graphics are nice and stylized.... that's all I can give it.The plot and characters are meh at best and the focus here is memes. Just, so many memes. They actually break moments of tension to force in a meme. Heaven forbid you actually got 2 seconds without an outdated meme shoe-horned in, don't want you to get emotionally invested in ANYTHING going on.In The Incredibles the line was ""when everyone's special, nobody is."" This happens here. They aren't characters they're quirks created specifically to meme something and it gets loud, obnoxious and cringey very, very quickly.Maybe good for entertaining the five year olds but I doubt they'll recognize any of the decade old memes and fads this movie is pushing.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
96,chandean-69762,The Mitchell's vs. the Machines 2021 Review,10,3 May 2021,"""Well I believe this group of weirdos is the best humanity's got. So let's get weird.""
Sony Pictures Animation makes their next masterpiece after the stunning and beautiful Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.The Mitchell's vs. The Machines is so abundant in emotion. I laughed, I smiled, and I cried ... multiple times. I honestly don't think i've cried this much during a film since The Green Mile.The animation is extraordinarily beautiful and unique. It's a less comic-booky inspired art style when compared to Into the Spider-Verse, but it still has its little quirks like the pop up illustrations that reminded me of the ""BOOM POW"" of a comic book but this time it's used mainly to convey emotion and Katie's colorful imagination.This film is also full of great and meaningful messages. Even smaller messages like Eric Andres character watching Katie's short films saying they bring him joy showing that even smaller content creators can make and brighten up random peoples day. It's all really beautiful.One thing I did really enjoy is they never shoved down the ""technology bad"" stereotype that most movies have about technology typically do, it seemed overall pretty subtle even though being directly in your face the whole time. The internet references never felt dated or like they would eventually feel dated too.The humor is also amazing. Full of gags for all ages to enjoy while also never being too overbearing or out of place which is always something to praise. It's also extremely self-aware! The Furbys and their dialogue was hands down the funniest and most fever dream-like sequence of the whole film.The Mitchell's vs. The Machines blew away my expectations and is by far the best animated film i've seen since Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse.I honestly don't think I could praise this movie enough. I loved every second and may even go in for a second watch with my Mom later today.This WILL win a Oscar mark my words.""It isn't illegal if you're good at it!""",The Mitchells vs the Machines
97,theredsky,The Mitchells vs the Machines,8,8 May 2021,"An absolute blast of a film. I went in with moderate expectations but came out thoroughly impressed. This has a great visual style provided by the same people behind The Lego Movie and Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. The animation style pops and feels unique compared to other animated films which I liked. I also love how the animation was used to incorporate comedy because the film is pretty hilarious. If you don't enjoy subtle pop culture references then you might not like the comedy but I think the set up and punchline of almost every joke worked. They even pause the film at times to make a joke which worked sometimes and other times it kinda deflated the tension but it didn't bother me that much. A lot of these story beats feel very similar which is a common complain I hear and I do kinda agree with it. There really wasn't a lot story and thematically wise that surprised me but I still like it because the writing is great. While the basic story threads are predictable, the circumstances are nice and refreshing with a take over the world kind of story. It was a fun take on a story that can be seen as predictable. I thought the emotional beats the film laid out hit a lot and some of it hit different for me as I am also going away to film school just like the main character. The characters all feel very fun and refreshing and I liked their little arcs that they went through and the voice cast did a great job as well with it. If you are a fan of animation then you will love this film. I would highly recommend checking it out.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

The story sets up where The Mitchells go on a road trip until the whole world was being invaded by robots and other machines so it's up to Katie and her family to survive the worldwide assault and stop the invasion. Now first off, I just want to say that this movie made me laugh, there are a couple of random, funny moments here and there and the action scenes are really cool. I love how the Mitchells interact with their funny weirdness and the moral of the film is rather sweet and heartwarming. Sony Pictures Animation did a fantastic job on how they did with The Mitchells vs. The Machines and this is considered to be one of my favorite Sony animated films of all time alongside with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The Angry Birds Movie, Open Season, Surf's Up, The Angry Bird Movie 2, The Pirates! Band of Misfits, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse and the Hotel Transylvania franshise.

The creators behind Spiderman Into the Spider-Verse were involved in this film and you can clearly tell by the brilliant animation. It's just beautiful to watch and it shows the level of talent in the animation game right now. The story itself was fine, albeit slightly cliche, with a lot of hilarious humour added throughout. The animation and the comedy really make this film what it is. There wasn't any obvious negatives that I noticed, I know it's aimed at younger viewers, but the animation was the main reason behind watching it and I'm glad I did.

Considering it's from the producers of Gravity Falls, the animation really stands out in 3D. The characters are enjoyable. The action is engaging when we get to the robot apocalypse element. And the best the movie offered that surprises me a lot, the comedy. This has contains the funniest comedy Sony Animation has produced in a long time. Seriously, I couldn't stop laughing how screw ups the Mitchells are especially Rick.

109,quiqueperezsoler,"Good, but it could have been Great. Lost a bit of sight of the main messages under loud disjointed and jumbled comedy skits. But this is the right track for Sony Animation!",7,2 May 2021,"I have taken a look at other reviews in this site, most of them give them 10s across the board deeming it quirky, funny and with fantastic animation. While I don't deny these great qualities, this movie should be judged in regards to its context: the animation movie industry is going through a very unpredictable time with fantastic animation gems popping up every other year but overall, with studios not being able to maintaining a trustworthy reaction to the hype they are building.While most of them turn out to be entertaining, funny and incredibly well animated, the story is as much a part of it as the other elements, more important even so. You'd imagine this would be obvious yet most of the movies that are released lack a deep delivery of their message. It is as if, today, style is valued more than substance and this preference affects the legacy of a movie. I am one to believe, however creatively and commendable the animation and humor and references in this movie were, the story leaves much to be desired. The trailers and plot summary presented a great premise, with seemingly cliched themes but the promise of a different, refreshing take on them. Nevertheless, from minute 1 the pacing of the story is disjointed and all over the place and this approach to storytelling is maintained throughout the movie which may be the reason why the people that mention it believe that the movie is ""too loud and with little to say"".But don't get me wrong, the movie has some really great moments and themes that I felt gave depth and meaning to the interactions and relationships of the characters. The approach to a dysfunctional but loving family, that simply members of it sometimes do not connect as the new and older generations have to deal with the arrival of technology as a crucial part in the lives of their young ones. A recurring theme that while at first hinted at a good message to the kids to leave their phones, didn't quite stick the landing. By referencing the meme culture, the culture of having to experience everything with or on your phone felt a bit wrong because we could see ourselves reflected in those screen-obsessed people, missing all the fun and action that lies out there. And perhaps that's another disappointing aspect I saw in the movie, the trailers made us think the movie would deal with the ""nature vs technology"" side, extravagantly decorating the finale with a robot apocalypse, while telling the story of why the dad and the daughter drifted apart and eventually found a way to ""reconnect"". And in a way they did... But it did so in 2-3 scenes in the entire movie.The development of these messages was not progressive, building up in a cohesive manner. It came and went when it pleased falling behind the comedic moments and other plot elements. The movie was called ""Connected"" and why this was changed to Mitchells vs the Machines escapes me, perhaps it'd was a better choice for marketing purposes but still. The title lead me to believe the movie's main theme was going to be reconnecting with a loved one and other subplots related to a fun family film, which it's true we ended up having; however the movie was missing that coming of age tale to conclude the arc of the main protagonist who I can't help but confess I disliked in some parts of the movie as her lack of simpathy and selfishness was unbearable.The rest of the family felt one dimensional as their almost quirky-cliched personalities had almost little to no relevance to theirs or the overall plot. And this is especially harmful with the character of the mom, which I personally find absolutely offensive as her passive presence makes her almost useless (not to mention her ""transformation"" in the end which completely came out of nowhere and felt absolutely out of character). And the humor, while great many times, felt like the movie was throwing a handfull of arrows into the air hoping some would hit the target. THe abundancy and constancy of them stopping the scene and therefore the pace of the story was jarring and annoying.IN CONCLUSION, the movie felt promising and the experience was entertaining and fun. It's just that it turned out to be an average family movie and perhaps the hype that Sony Animation's Spiderverse left behind provided huge expectations about the release of this one. Expectations that, in my opinion, were met in the animation department; but were very underwhelming in the character and plot development. I related to many themes displayed in this movie: not being understood by my family (also as a creative type myself too), wanting to find people like me who appreciated my creations,... Had this movie focused more on the emotions and messages more than the world-dominating and funny skits, it could have been one of my favorite animated movies. *sigh*",The Mitchells vs the Machines

112,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Robocalyse Now: The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,11 May 2021,"What we all need is some good, old-fashioned escapist fare! Right?!? What could be better than a nice, family-friend animated movie? How about an animated action-comedy about the robot apocalypse - Robocalypse? Enter Netflix with The Mitchells vs. The Machines. Is this just watch the therapist ordered? Here goes...The Mitchells vs. The Machines is an animated action-comedy about a typical middle-American family that embarks on a road trip to take the oldest child, Katie Mitchell, to film school in California. As it so happens, the robot apocalypse arrives in the middle of their trip. Here, Katie Mitchell is an aspiring filmmaker, always behind her camera and struggling to find her community through her artistic expression. Rick Mitchell, the father, doesn't understand Katie or anything about technology, really. The brewing tension between father and daughter bubbles over as Katie desperately wants to escape home and find her place at film school. In a bid to recapture their old bond, Rick packs up the family and plans to drive Katie to school across country as last minute family outing. As most cross-country family adventures go, the Mitchells are suffering through disappointing roadside attractions and general claustrophobia until the machines come and force the family to work together to save the world. It all happens in the way only an animated movie can do.There's a lot to recommend in this movie. First, the visual style is amazing. There is a lot of kinetic energy to the animation. You won't know where to look and the detail is inspiring. It is clever how there seems to be a mixed-media quality to the animation. It could get overwhelming at times, but it is never boring. Moreover, all of the various visual styles complement the story. Second, the writing hit the marks you would want from an action-adventure-comedy animated movie. There are sight gags that reference technology and social media. Fred Armisen and Beck Bennett play dim-witted robots, who team up with the Mitchells, and they add to the humor. Olivia Colman give a great voice-performance as the A. I. villain, who set the robot apocalypse in motion. She has the wit and mischievousness that these animated villains need. While there are some apocalypse tropes that pop up throughout, there is a lot more that feels fresh that what could be cliched does not completely derail the good time.My biggest gripe about The Mitchells vs. The Machines is that it takes a long time to get to the ""vs. The Machines"" part of the movie. There is a lot of set up. Obviously, the goal of the set up is so that the audience invests in the success of the family, particularly the rekindling of the father-daughter relationship; but, I felt that it took too long. Further, once the movie does get to the ""vs. The Machines"" part, while it is satisfying and entertaining, it also becomes too much of a good thing. At an hour and 49 minutes, the movie is too long and could have hit all of the action-comedy marks, including the emotional climax, if some extraneous things had been cut.Netflix certainly delivered with this one. The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a great family film that has nice themes about both individuality and family togetherness. There is humor and heart throughout. The action is entertaining and the animation is visually intriguing. Gather the family with a big box of popcorn and enjoy the Robocalypse.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

117,Clank_Zoka,Exactly the Kind Of Film We Needed!,10,1 May 2021,"You have no idea how long I have been waiting for this film to come out, it was supposed to come out last year but due to a certain pandemic, it was delayed to this year and it was originally titled ""Connected"", but since the film was brought out by Netflix and it was renamed Mitchells Vs the Machines and it came out yesterday, I finally got the chance to watch it since Lord & Miller produced it and the director Michael Rianda was a writer on Gravity Falls, hell even Alex Hirsch has a small role here, all of this and the comic book style animation really grabbed my attention here!, a weird family that ends up in a robot apocalypse and have to save the world, sounds entertaining enough and that social media seems to play a key part here!, sounds like the film that I think anyone would enjoy the heck out of, so I was super happy to see it finally come out this year and now I finally watched it and... I loved it!, quite a pleasant surprise and something that is worth watch especially during this difficult time, so let's talk about it!Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson) has applied for college and she is planning to go there to do animation, but her strange family kinda hold her back especially Rick (Danny McBride) who thinks that going to college and doing short films won't really get her far, so both Katie and Rick usually would disagree and argue with each other, but Linda (Maya Rudolph) advises Rick to fix the problem, so he cancels her plane ticket to college and instead go there viva road trip, so he can get along with Katie more, Linda and the youngest of the bunch Aaron (Michael Rianda) come along for the ride, until something unexpected happens, a robot apocalypse caused by the phone company PAL Lab lead by PAL herself (Olivia Colman), so it's up to the Mitchells to now save the world from robots!, now this definitely sounds familiar, a family trying to save the world from some evil threat?, yeah it's been done to death so many times before, but yet this film does it in such a delightful and wacky way!, it doesn't take itself too seriously or anything, it just has fun with what it has, it has everything that makes animation fun and expressive, the humour is just the right amount of clever jokes, random and slapstic fun to give it a unique sense of entertainment!, it's all so well executed to bring this spectacular looking film to life!, it has a rather feel good relatability to it mainly in how anyone can quickly relate to what Katie is going through, I can simplify with her in how Rick sees her, it has this rather nice and relatable family element, there is lots of cool and hyper creative action that keeps this film very well balanced and inventive to keep audiences engaged and entertained!, however the only normal ordinary bit is the story itself, it is very predictable and even cliched to the point that the story is the only unoriginal thing about this film, but with that said, the film does make fun of how bland and unoriginal it's plot is so I'll give it a pass just for self awareness, so with all insanity and craziness, the film works on pretty much every conceivable way, it has the right amount of heart, nice throwbacks to some amazing old school memes and even social media, great comedy with amazingly written jokes, creative battle and action scenes and even a very creative opening with a nice family and teenage element to add that relatability, so despite a basic story, the film has more of a identity then it has any right to have, i mean without all those elements, it would of been a very generic family apocalyptic in all honesty.The animation is awesome..., what else can be said but... WOW!, it's mind-blowing, I love the look of this movie, it has so much style, colour and action!, very similar to Spider-Verse, I love how cartoony the characters look, they have that artist and original look to them, especially the family and some minor characters, the scenes that has like filters have that teenage College look to it, even the editing is like something from a YouTube Poop, it definitely is used like a college movie which is quite a coincidence, the robots from PAL Labs looks pretty cool and creative but can look a bit generic for my taste but still look nice, especially PAL herself which is just a phone with a face can lead to so many laughs and creative expressions, this animation is super expressive and must of been a joy to animate, you can tell there is love and amazing detail to this and it shows, so despite how ordinary the PAL Bots look, the animation goes above and beyond anything animation has done in this style, it has the right amount of cartoony style, colour, action, originality and lots of cool editing, it gives this film a unique look that I didn't think was possible but the film found a way and it's beautiful!.The characters are all delightfully weird!, I think they are all wonderful and excellent!, especially Katie and Rick, Katie is the one I can relate to the most, she's funny, witty and is very understandable from her point of view, she is a very endearing main character, Rick is also the same as well as Katie, he thinks more practically then Katie does and he does trust to get along more with his daughter and actually try to understand her, he's also really funny and so thinking outside the box, Linda's a good supporting character and a really loving mother who helps Rick when he needs help, Aaron is cute and funny as Katie's brother who loves dinosaurs, the two robots Eric (Beck Bennett) and Deborahbot 5000 (Fred Armisen) are wonderful robot characters that get a good laugh from them learning about society, the villain PAL is perhaps my favourite character in the entire film!, she is hilarious and has a wonderfully funny personality!, Mark Bowman (Eric André) really isn't in the film for that long so.., he doesn't do much, although he did created PAL Labs, but yet he's not that important, hell even though the voice acting is just as awesome as the characters, Olivia Colman is delightful as PAL, she has the best performance in here, everyone else does great like Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Abbi Jacobson, Eric André, Beck Bennett and even Alex Hirsch himself in a small role, they are do a fantastic job in their roles!, the characters are just entertaining enough to be relatable and just plain hilarious, the voice acting, writing and personality really bring these characters to life!.The music is pleasant to listen to, I love Mark Mothersbaugh's score and he always does a good job, I also love the soundtrack with different choices of songs especially with one song that has Numa Numa, it's quite bizarre but very nostalgic and cool!Well I didn't expect this film to be this... AWESOME!, seriously, The Mitchells Vs. The Machines is a absolutely delightful chaotic film that has just about everything that makes animation wonderful!, with quite a engaging story with big heart, amazing humour and cool and creative action!, animation that is very stylised and pleasing for any viewer, really likeable characters that can be funny and even endearing, along with super terrific voice acting, great music and hell even a great commentary on social media, this film is tied between Spider-Verse as being the best animated Sony animated film out there, this is definitely a must watch for the entirely family, but mainly I can see teenagers and older viewers watching this as a relatable weird and nostalgic movie, this is definitely the film we needed during this difficult time, it really shows how we needed to be social outside of phones and gadgets, but it really shows how it feels to be back in normality, i want to see what Michael Rianda does next, I do hope we get more awesome films like this, I hope the next film by Sony will live up the fantasticness of this film, well I guess we'll have to wait until Wish Dragon comes out, however it'll end up, it won't beat this!This film 100% gets a 10/10.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Using real world footage and 2D imagery on top of 3D as an example works really well.The animation and art direction is absolutely fantastic. That by itself was a solid 9 of 10.I would say that the story however was a bit boring and cliche. There was also an abundance of 'American family morals' that started to annoy me around the 2nd and 3rd act.Lastly, the character abilities were over the top; turning them into super-super heroes that behaved exactly what made the screenplay move forward ruined any form of suspense for me.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

126,severindringel,"The family isn't that dysfunctional, but what a fun experience",8,13 May 2021,"Sony has done it again and gifted us with a new top-class animated film after Into the Spiderverse. The Mitchells vs. The Machines is the directorial debut of Michael Rianda and follows the young filmmaker Katie through her family life, which is mainly characterised by the constant arguments with her conservative father. When she learns that she has been accepted to her dream film academy, she can hardly wait, but before that she has to go on an impromptu trip with her family, which is haunted by a sudden robot apocalypse.Even though there are no real actors behind animated characters, it is the voices of various actors that make their mark on the film. Danny McBride and Maya Rudolph in particular lend a lot of charm and comedy appeal to Katie's parents with their pointed and perfectly timed statements. If you've thought for a while that Olivia Colman can do anything, this film finally confirms it. Her voicing of the antagonist Pal, who is not even a real person but a smartphone, cannot be surpassed in absurdity. The choice of which characters the film focuses on is very balanced, making none more important than the other. Katie may be the protagonist, but her parents and also her little brother Aaron get just as much time and space to shine. The latter is going through a phase of obsession with dinosaurs (and honestly, who didn't have a phase like that back then?) and doesn't want to admit his growing interest in girls. In general, the characters are very relatable despite their fictionality and it never feels like you're watching an animated but a ""normal"" feature film. The highlights of the cast, however, don't even come from the Mitchell family. Or actually they do, because their dog Dirk is part of the family. He, in combination with two robots who undergo a change of heart after initially having bad intentions, makes for scenes in which you really laugh your head off. It is precisely these stupidly optimistic but incredibly endearing characters that give this film so many more facets and make it a real laugh-fest.Generally, there is very little to criticise about The Mitchells vs. The Machines. The characters fit, it's a feel-good story that's stripped but never over the top, and above all it has its heart in the right place. The fact that every premise says that the Mitchells are a dysfunctional family is far from reality. Yes, they have their problems and the father-daughter relationship in particular is a big focus of the film, but in the stages the characters go through, these behaviours are only common. The somewhat forced imperfection of the family makes them even more normal, which is a bit distracting in some parts of the film. In general, the plot is not the most original - robot-apocalypse, ""dysfunctional"" family saves the world - who doesn't know it. In the course of it, however, there is a lot of social criticism of society's internet and mobile phone use, which is an important and nice bonus. The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a feel-good adventure that will bring a lot of smiles to our faces in these difficult times.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

It does a great job at pointing out we are enslaved by our own technology much like the second incredibles movie. However at every turn it tries to use the jokes from that technology to carry the humerous end of the movie. I dont follow internet fads so it went past me.I admit to identifying with the father. When he smashes all their phones it was cathartic. I often look around my living room when we have guests and everyone is on their phone. I wonder why waste the gas to come over if you are going to stare at a phone most of the time. I so want to instal a jammer to shut all the damn things down.So I am giving this a 6.

It was wonderful to watch.This is one of the best animation (albeit cartoony) I've seen in ages and rivals that of Pixar. The story has a modern solid underlying message behind the brilliant animation and narration.The family reminds me somewhat of the family in ""The Incredibles"" but without the super-powers and with real world family issues. But alas being a family friendly movie, all is sorted while fighting for the survival of the world.It's super fun to watch and I hope there is a sequel to follow.VERDICT:

Honestly the characters and story definitely felt relatable to me, especially the characterization of Katie. It was a fun thrill ride from start to finish and I was laughing my butt off watching these characters' silly antics, especially the hilarious Rick Mitchell😂😂😂😂😂😂.The animation of this movie was very creative and smoothly-drawn. It's almost like watching a kid's drawing come to life on a screen. The animation style is sort of a ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" meets ""Spider-Verse"" sort of depiction, but still incredibly well-crafted and visually appealing. The colors, characterizations, and movement all blend in together well, and I love the use of colored pencil-style hand-drawn animation, especially during the scenes when the drawings on Katie's notebook come to life in her imagination.""The Mitchells vs. The Machines"" might possibly be my favorite movie out there and the most relatable animated movie I have ever seen in history.

What's worse is that it just wasn't funny, at all. Out of the mile a minute gags that are fired about memes, phones, cat filters, surveillance capitalism, killer kitchen utensils and pugs, about 98% failed to even register a smile. Mostly it just comes of as annoying. They had the opportunity to do some punchy satire here, but it's all very low brow and childish. The lackluster voice acting didn't help either.Structurally, it's a mess. Many of the scenarios feel like they were selected with a dartboard at a writers session (a throwaway sequence involving an army of Furbies at a shopping mall being one such example).There are no real threats or stakes and so we have no reason to care about anything that happens, or believe the heroes might fail. Stuff is just thrown at the screen in a haphazard way and explained with some lazy dialog exposition.When we're supposed to care about the feeble father/daughter drama at the core of the film, we just get some soft piano chords and a few sad eye closeups. Compare the storytelling of Mitchells to say The Incredibles, which has similar themes, and it really feels lacking.I was so bored after 40 minutes, I almost gave up. If I have to give any credit to the film, it goes to the artists who have done an exceptional job creating a unique and striking visual style.

It was very exciting the entire time with plenty of action sequences and the animation and voice acting was great, but it was just so all over the place with a blantant uninterest for keeping its focus. The memeyness was pretty excessive and something i could do without, (not even to mention its going to make this movie incredibly dated in no time) and the script had a LOT of conventinces. I dunno, maybe its just because i was expecting a better plot from the creators of the lego movie and spider man: into the spider verse but the clunky script really hurt the film.

Gravity Falls
Ladybird
Life is Strange (videogame)Finally, a quality animation. Not only it is brought to you by Sony Animations, the studio that made the Oscar-winning ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" 3 years ago (their first project after the Oscar); it was also directed by the creative director of the first season of ""Gravity Falls"" and written by the writer of it's second season. The sole creator of the ""Gravity Falls"" show Alex Hirsch worked as a story consultant on this film, and you can really feel the Gravity Falls influence in the signature pacing and crazy humor of ""Mitchells"".Like all greatest animations, ""The Mitchells and the Machines"" is a very childish yet a very adult film. The Mitchells, possibly the weirdest family in the world, finds themselves in a position where they are humanity's only hope in overcoming a sentient robot apocalypse. You know, the usual. The main theme of the movie though isn't so much the robots, but the relationships the family has - to each other as well as to the outside world. We have a teenager girl who feels insecure and isolated because of her unusual interests, the age-old problem of finding your tribe. We have a dysfunction father-daughter relationship where both can't seem to understand each other and find a way to talk about it. We have a mother that tries her hardest to give her family the very best in all possible areas of life but finds herself comparing the behind the scenes of her family's life with the highlight's reel of the lives of others. We have a little brother who, apart from loving dinosaurs, is afraid to express his feelings of any kind to anyone in fear of rejection and misunderstanding, not even being able to tell his sister how agonizingly much he will miss her once she leaves home. And we have a dumb and useless but absolutely lovable pug who is the soul of the whole film. All these character traits are very subtly and gradually exposed in the movie, while keeping the crazy, video-game-like, colorful mask to keep the youngest members of the audience entertained. Every character is relatable, you can see the quirks and behavior of each one in your own family members and I really admire how well they were able to frame these kinds of problems and stories that practically any family in the world has.This film is the definition of a family film, you are supposed to sit down and enjoy it with your whole family, although you must be careful - at least one is bound to cry by the end of it.

158,JoelAlexanderr,Hilariously enjoyable family fun with great social commentary,8,4 May 2021,"THE MITCHELLS VS. THE MACHINES is a wonderful family movie with an amazing sense of humor that was just released on Netflix. It's about a heavily dysfunctional family who goes on a cross-country trip to deliver the eldest daughter to her first year of college, but who gets dramatically interrupted when the machine apocalypse happens. It's essentially if you took the plot of Terminator, combined it with National Lampoon's Vacation, watered it down for a family-friendly audience, and updated it to fit today's ever-growing technology.By far the best part of this film is the comedy, which is some of the best in any animated film since perhaps Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. From the beginning to the end, the movie is consistently laugh-out-loud funny no matter what age demographic you are. It comments on our dependence to technology in both a thoughtful and hilarious way, and includes some jokes taken straight from memes I've seen on the Internet, which I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to see in a wide-released film. A scene involving Furbys is probably the hardest I've laughed all year while watching a movie, but that's just one of many many sequences that will have audiences rolling with laughter. This family film even contains references and homages to violent R-rated movies such as Terminator, Mad Max: Fury Road, Dawn of the Dead, and much more. The filmmakers have my utmost respect for sneaking in that many allusions.I'm a bit mixed on the emotional arc of the film, however. I love the general message it sends, which is to appreciate one's family even if there are differences in ways of thinking, but the way the emotional arc wraps up in the last 30 minutes is very trite and doesn't land. It tries to have a Pixar-esque emotional conclusion, but it instead comes across as forced and cringe-worthy. There are also a countless amount of coincidences in the final fight scene, which made it difficult for me to suspend disbelief and be truly invested in what was happening.THE MITCHELLS VS. THE MACHINES is still very much worth the watch no matter what age group you are (it will stick especially well with families). I don't see movies often enough that manage to successfully make me laugh for every minute of screentime (shoutout to Monchi the dog) and that even have casual LGBTQ representation without jamming a performative message down people's throats. Highly recommended for anybody looking for some unconditional fun! B+",The Mitchells vs the Machines

but it feels so incredibly disingenuous almost every time these characters speak. They are mostly portrayed as over the top caricatures, with ""#relatable"" human issues. But with the exception of the main character, the Mitchel family's humanity doesn't really shine through until the end. Which makes any of the emotional beats fall flat on their face, since they lack any kind of grounding.I wanted to care about the Mitchel's or even the world they occupied, but I don't care about cardboard cutouts.What didn't help as well, was the constant onslaught of bad jokes and tired comedy tropes with additional support by name droppings like: facebook, instagram and youtube.This is the kind of ""Ralph Breaks the Internet - Emojy Movie - sh**"" that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But I could definitely imagine watching this again ""under the influence"".It's not boring, it's just dumb.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

It may take you to artsy weird films, humans-loathing machines (wholly called Pal), even a human ripping a mechanical heart out of an advanced robot; but what's worth watching is the love the Mitchells have for each other, and their weirdness, of course. Every family is weird, if you ask me, in their own unique way. Do you want to see a colourfully animated and berserk family film? Then, you know what to watch.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

166,azeezsmith-61542,The Mitchells Vs The Machines Review- An INSTANT ANIMATION MASTERPIECE,10,9 October 2021,The Mitchell's Vs The Machines Really Is Such A Spectacular Outstanding Phenomenal Movie That Keeps You Hooked. The Voice Cast Is Amazing. The Story And Plot Is Very Good. But Beside All That THE ANIMATION IS JUST SOO 0UT OF THIS WORLD AND SOOO MAGNIFICENT. I Was Tearing Up In This Movie Soo SADLY and it felt good. This Whole Movie Was Soo Funny And Quirky From A Weird Goofy Family That I Completely Felt In Love With. It Had Incredibles Vibe To It. The Amount Of Hard Work And Filters And Work That The Creators And Director Put Into This Movie- I Appreciate Them For It Deeply. A Highly Recommend On Netflix.,The Mitchells vs the Machines

And I have to admit that The Mitchells vs. The Machines was a refreshing change. Sure there are a lot of jaded reviews on this film, but see it for yourselves before you take ANYONE'S opinions as facts. All of the voice overs were done excellently and the comedy was better than most live action films that I've seen recently. Do yourself a favor and have a good time with this one..",The Mitchells vs the Machines

170,KieranSaosila,A Nice Family Watch,6,27 May 2021,"It's nice, but as an adult, this didn't quite stick the landing for me. The weaving of various animation styles, the trope-y scenarios, the miscast voice acting for a particular character. I just felt the overall plot was a little generic, though I did enjoy the emphasis towards the connection between the characters, which I guess at its core is what the film was really about. It's fun, and there are some laughs to be had, but it's definitely catered towards younger audiences.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

173,samog-98289,So much better than The Emoji Movie!!!,7,7 May 2021,Here's my spoiler-free review of The Mitchells vs The Machines; so what did I think of it? I enjoyed this film! Abbi Jacobson and Eric Andre are so great together in this movie! (fun fact: they starred together in Matt Groening's Disenchantment) It's nice to see Danny McBride and Maya Rudolph in another Sony movie besides The Angry Birds duology! This is Abbi Jacobson and Fred Armisen's second animated movie together since 2017's The LEGO Ninjago Movie. Not going to say too much about Olivia Coleman's character Pal. Overall I highly recommend this film to the whole family during the worldwide lockdown and is far better than that awful Emoji Movie from 2017!!!,The Mitchells vs the Machines
174,StrayFeral,But Tarantino can eat his socks!,10,6 May 2021,"This is the most creative and most hilarious cartoon I've seen in the last ten years, maybe more. Whoever came with the visuals for this, must get Oscar for creativity.In short, this movie is: Terminator meets Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo meets Lilo & Stitch and all together they go and Kill Bill, but Tarantino can eat his socks.Let me explain. In short, this is a movie about the modern society and the direction we are headed with our obsession about social networks and the resulting real-life de-socialization. In the end, there is a machine apocalypse, just as the trailer mentioned, thus the ""Terminator"" relation. However, this movie is much more about family relations, thus the ""Lilo & Stitch"" reference, except this movie is more about the family than ""Lilo & Stitch"" is. There is a huge amount of surrealism, thus the ""Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo"" reference and in the end they mock some famous movies, thus the Tarantino reference, however they do it in a really hilarious and much better manner. There is also a bit of coming-out-of-age element.The movie as a whole is an explosive bouquet of emotions, both funny and sad. Speaking of funny, I've never laughed so much on a cartoon in the recent years. I was nearly rolling on the floor and the entire family was.So in short, some scores from me:
Visuals: 10/10
Music/sound: 10/10
Story: 10/10
Creativity: 30/10
Characters: 20/10If somebody wants to do a funny cartoon, even a live action movie, this is the movie they need to study from.They definitely need to make a second part and they need to accent on the pug a bit more.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

177,joostkale,"Being normal is fine, being weird is awesome!",9,30 April 2021,"WOW! This movie has no place being this good. I was going in this thinking I'd get a fun little family comedy, but I never thought it would be this relatable, emotional and honestly, this funny. The jokes kept coming left and right, and it kept hitting. Of course not every single joke hits, but I kept laughing. There are jokes for little children, teens and adults, and all of them work for their target audience. The thing that I was worried about the most was the robot storyline. We have seen it before, so what are they going to do different? Well, have fun! While being a little predicable, if I'm having so much fun, I don't even care. The robot story is fun and entertaining, but the family is what made it fantastic. Being in the same age range as our main protagonist, I feel what she is going through. It's hard to figure out yourself and the older I'm getting, the more I start to grow apart from my father. He doesn't understand everything that I love and that's okay. It made a little emotional to see the father sacrifice his dream to take care of his daughter, and it made me want to thank my own father. If a movie can make me realize something in my own life, it must do something right. It's funny, relatable, emotional, but most of all, a fantastic time!",The Mitchells vs the Machines
178,Drawmort,"The humorous collision between two generations in a technological apocalypse. Believe it or not, it works.",8,14 May 2021,"We finally have a movie with a plot that reflects the interaction of a largely common family with today's technology. Here we see how the internet, social media and viral videos generation collide with the old hobbies (like camping, cooking or hanging out with the family) generation. And not only that, but we also see this collision transform into a fusion where emotions and family ties work as glue.Humor ad hoc to the context everywhere: embarrassing situations, personality conflicts, awkward movements and much more, always in total synchrony with a very well told story and a very well achieved animation, especially focused on gesticulation and precise body communication to every scene. Perhaps the only bad thing could have been an excess of enthusiasm in the approach and construction of the villain to overcome, exaggerating the adverse event to overcome.Fully recommended to watch with your family and play to identify with each character, as the film also includes as an ingredient some deep reflections on how to improve interpersonal relationships within the family nucleus, as if something were missing to complete the almost perfect production of the creators of Spider -man Into The Spider-Verse, who with this work secured their ticket to next year's great prizes.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

The animation is very unique and original. The humour lands, it is heartfelt and energetic. This film works in every way. It has all the energy you expect from a Lord and Miller film, they only produced it but you can tell they were the brains behind it all. You have all this tension within the family, none of it is over dramatic or anything it all feels real and makes them feel like a real family. It has a wonderful script, wonderfully directed and watching it put a huge smile on my face.The Bad- I can't watch it for the first time again😂😂😂, I actually can't think of any big issues with this film it is awesome in every way.Overall I'm going to give The Mitchell's Vs The Machines a 9/10.

It's very funny and cute but in the Mitchell Family it's awesome!I highly recommend this movie and if you watch it with family it's even better!

Except better in every way of course. This film not only LOOKS AMAZING, it is also so much more HILARIOUS than I expected, the story is straightforward and sticks to it really well.In film, it's incredibly hard to make heartfelt and comedic work equally well and have neither ruin the other. Both aspects in this movie compliment each other spectacularly.I saw the trailer and was afraid because a lot of what I took in could've gone SO wrong. I then looked up who the people behind the movie and my expectations went higher.Despite there being cliché relationship tropes, each character is just so well voiced and charismatic. They are all done excellently. I can relate a lot to relationship issues and seeing them fixed just fills my heart with joy.The thing that I love about this film is that it takes so many clichés and uses them to their absolute best. Proving that good movies can still be made even if there are more modern jokes and popular characteristics.Overall a movie that exceeded my expectations VERY highly. The perfect, splendid blend of Heartfelt and Comedy. I recommend this film to all and give as much love and support to you genius, hard working folks behind this film! I would be more surprised than ever if a better animated movie is released this year.10/10.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
183,jamaisj-838-93732,Look! A family-friendly movie that's not cloying!,8,2 May 2021,"This was all sorts of fun! I'm usually nervous when they throw a lot of weird stuff at the wall, but in this case it works. It starts as a family road trip, and then the family ends up saving the world from the robots in the best way possible.Oh, and the villain is awesome: Never before have I felt sympathy with a villain that just wanted to eliminate humanity, but it does so in such an awesomely funny way that you can't help but relate. The family picks up two droids that are some of the best comedy relief ever, and while I have some issues with the technology used you just quickly go with it.While I wish it would get away from the incompetent dad/competent mother cliche, here it's used to effect, with the dad able to do what needs to get done and the mother allowed to just kick butt (you have never seen a mother go full Gundam like this one does). The dinosaur-obsessed son is awesome, and the film-school daughter gets to have some serious fun.Overall, this is a really fun movie and one you need to see: It does family-friendly without being cloying, and once you get into the groove of the movie it's a really fun ride.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Is it going to be like the incredibles or the croods? No it's definitely not. I wasn't a fan of the animation style of the spiderverse movie and i didn't watch that entire movie even to this day. But i must say i was really laughing in the trailer. The jokes are so funny i Don't know if Conan O'Brien had wrote the script bits maybe he did because it was extremely witty jokes. I loved every bit of those. Yes the animation is different and feels a little distracting sometimes but the storyline and characters works well.

This is the movie kids are finishing to the end while parents fell asleep on a couch. The most notable part of this movie is that the whole designs of the movie such as character designs and graphic designs, are very well done. Those flash cartoon contents are also very nice, however, it has become annoying later. I could also see a lot of plugs of Japanese culture especially with one of those Japanese sci-fi animation hero - I can't remember the name - which mom is portraying at the end.

194,The_nibs,Good for families and young people,6,1 May 2021,"Bad for adults without kids: the pace is like a sugar filled toddler bouncing off the walls and feels like you're stuck in endless loop of bad Instagram stories. I don't give a damn for memes, gifs, or terrible music remixed by Rihanna making it equally terrible. All that being said, it hits its target audience perfectly! Gen Z will fall in love with it's hyper active antics, over the top voice talents, and action packed (albeit terribly cliched) storyline. It's not very original from either a sci fi adventure or coming of age perspective. The going away to college/family tension story arc was predictable. I don't understand why it's always gotta be the dad who doesn't ""get"" or support his kid, where are all the awesome dads in these films? Also, I really wish that story tellers would endeavor to teach our future generations that education isn't everything and you won't always get the job that you go to school for. I realize most will scoff at it, but the dad encouraging his daughter to have a back up plan should've been more than just his disbelief in what she does. This should've been discussed further as a family unit, to demonstrate the realities of post secondary education and life itself. It wouldn't have hurt for both parents to say, ""yeah, you like to make movies, and we hope you're successful at it, but if it doesn't pan out *we're* here for you."" Instead kids will think parents just plain don't ""believe in them"" when they say they want to grow up to be professional TikTok influencers... It's clear the filmmakers just wanted to make a fun, cutesy, geeky movie for Gen Z, but I wish they had given more depth and a stronger message behind all the fun.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

204,Jodro2,Cringe-country,2,7 June 2021,"Oh dear. This movie has a cool story line and admirable lessons about over-use of smart-phones and the dangers of AI. Kudos for that. But the execution is dreadful.The most jarring thing for us--and this includes our teenagers, presumably the main age-category this movie is aimed at--is the habit of the movie to every two minutes or so drag the viewer out of the story with some super-clever, supposedly zany moments where the graphic style completely changes, or an actual YouTube video is shown, or rainbows or other irrelevant artifacts parade across the screen, and so on. It means that one's nose is every two minutes rubbed in the fact that this is an animated movie and not real and not serious.Call us old-fashioned, but for the time we watch a move we like to believe in the universe it portrays. To be pulled out of the movie all the time is just jarring and we ended up with a shoulder-shrug: why watch this zero-second attention span rubbish?And... is this the new thing? Just before watching this, we tried The Willoughbys, and switched it off after 20 minutes, for this very reason. The most recent The Croods movie was hampered by this weirdness, though not quite as frequently. Have the days of the inherently consistent animated story telling of Ratatouille, The Lion King, How To Train Your Dragon, Studio Gibli, etc, really gone?Secondly, the movie was far, far, far too long. If it had stopped after the showdown in the shopping mall, we'd have given it 6 out of 10. But after that it continued for half an hour with mawkish, toe-curling, utter cringe, sentimental rubbish. Of course, it moves slowly and inexorably towards the final big shoot-out, which every American movie needs to have, it seems, and omg, is this section cringe and so unrealistic that all credibility and creative tension goes out of the window. The mother gets angry and turns into a robot-destroying, flying, super-hero. Super-cringe. The father and daughter also suddenly have super-powers and surf through the air and kill tons of robots. Cringe. And so on and on.Of course, physically impossible things happen in most animated movies all the time. But, again, a movie needs to be credible within its own parameters. This movie just doesn't care, anything goes as long as it's deemed funny, whether it's weird colours, weird flags, the YouTube videos, feats that were impossible two seconds earlier, characters turning into superheroes just because they get angry, and so on and on. Despite the on-point messages, sometimes rammed home too explicitly, both our teenagers judged the movie a cringe mess, and we could only agree.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Most of the time the part they want you to focus on looked awesome ( I should interject my personal opinion here; a lot of animated movies today look like they were made by computers, this type of movie looks like it was made by humans. I like that ) unfortunately they added these very cartoony extras, which would be alright with just a few, but they put so many of them I got tired of them. Like chocolate sprinkles !!

This movie is so forgettable, I forgot it's name like 3 times, and I already forgot most of the story, it was so bland.Did they rip off Pig the Pug?I'm a fan of the creators and producers (Gravity Falls and Spider-verse alumni) so I don't understand why this movie didn't hit the right notes with me, I wanted to like it.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

220,sean_pak215,"Great animation and sharp satire, but ultimately a bit underwhelming",7,30 May 2021,"I really wanted to like this more than I did. In some ways, this was admirably witty, meaningful and satirical, poking daggers at modern society's dependency on technology. This played like a kid-friendly version of Black Mirror. On a purely technical level, this was awesome, filled with beautiful, vibrant, sometimes surreal, animation. But why do we keep giving passes to family movies where everything works out too perfectly, action scenes end too neatly, and things become so predictable by the end? I mean, maybe I've watched too much Japanese animation, but the best anime clearly shows that you can make kid-friendly movies and series, and still be intelligent, unpredictable and unafraid to slow the pace down. But movies like this and the How To Train Your Dragon series are so frenetic and tidy. It's like the scripts have no breathing room at all, or any sense of real danger.This is still very much worth seeing though. As I said, the animation is stunning. The humor is also strong, and I found myself actually laughing at a lot of the jokes, which isn't normally the case even with other highly-touted cartoons. The satire on technology was spot-on, and there were a ton of amusing references to past science fiction classics (ie. The main villain, a smartphone, was named PAL, and most young audience members wouldn't even know 2001: A Space Odyssey).As is par for the course when it comes to childrens' movies, you also have some good lessons about family. However, making the Mitchells quirky outcasts isn't as original as the writers seem to think. So many family movies recently have quirky, ""different"" main characters. Ever since The Incredibles and maybe even earlier, it's been a thing. But for young audiences and families, the themes and messages here are admirable and effective.The action sequences were very well-presented and kinetic, but I started to get tired of the typical ""the baddies are winning, no the heroes are winning, no the baddies are winning, oh the heroes won at the last minute"" structure, where luck and coincidences began to stack up like the floating boxes that the humans were trapped in. And there's no need to make things so simplistic for the kids. As I said, plenty of cartoons, especially from other countries such as Japan, are much more natural in how they handle action sequences and overcoming adversity. Here, the ups and downs of the battles felt too forced, and the victory of the Mitchells at the climax felt too inevitable.So, definitely things about this I appreciated, and for a family movie it's very solid. But more discerning viewers may not be as satisfied.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

I persuaded my family (I'm 22) to sit down and watch this and we were crying with laughter within the first 5 minutes. I instantly fell in love with each of the main characters and their quirks. This is definitely a film I will becoming back to again and again! If you find yourself with time I couldn't recommend this film enough!The only thing that would make this film better would be a better link between the different locations but this doesn't take away from the enjoyment.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did :),The Mitchells vs the Machines

230,jessibi-91956,One of the best films of the year,8,7 May 2021,"The Mitchells vs the Machines completely took me by surprise I went into it not expecting much and by the end of the film I was crying my eyes out. A film about a dysfunctional family going on a road trip doesn't sound all the unique but this film also includes robots taking over the world, its almost like a mix between the Incredibles and the Terminator and man its amazing. I absolutely loved the quirky and vibrant animation style it was really refreshing to see something so different from what a usual animated film looks like. The family storyline hit me right in the feels, I loved the relationship between Katie and her dad, and it was extremely satisfying seeing them reconnect again throughout the film. The film is hilarious I laughed out loud so many times and there where only a few jokes that didn't land for me. The picture perfect neighbours voiced by Chrissy Teagan and John Legend where easily among the best part of the film for me and I loved the two robots who befriend the family as well. The voice cast is terrific, Abbi Jacobson does a great job at voicing teenager Katie but Danny McBride was the stand out of me he gave such a believable and hilarious performance as dad Rick and I hope he does more similar roles in the future. The villain voiced brilliantly by Olivia Colman is on the forgettable side and feels like a very typical villain character but I did understand her motivations and she was quite funny and entertaining at times. The third act goes on a bit to long for my liking but I still really enjoyed it and it was wonderful seeing the family work together to take down the Robots. As much as I laughed watching this film I was also crying several times throughout it, the home videos of Katie and her Dad where tear jerking moments and the ending where Katie goes off to film school and the family share a beautiful goodbye left me with tears streaming down my face. I honestly think this is a film the whole family can enjoy, there is something here for everyone and the Mitchells vs the Machines is without a doubt one of the best films of the year so far.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

236,helaxious,Another visual feast by sony!,9,3 May 2021,"I must say i was very impressed with this movie, when i saw the trailer, i had little hope for this movie, thought it would be another Illumination level garbage.Then i was told the director of this movie was the same as Spiderverse, ( also, both movies were made by sony ) you know, the best movie of past decade?! The movie that pushed the boundaries of 3d?So i was only sure of one thing, even if the story was garbage, even if the pacing dragged the whole thing off, I was sure the visuals would rock, and it didLet's talk about visuals, i'm going to be brief here, the visual style blew me away, it's nothing like i've seen before, it's on-par with Spiderverse.Let's talk the story for a moment, remember when everyone said the premise of the movie was conflicted?Going for a family trip story, plug off your phones, spend time with your family, reject technology or something along the lines.But then everyone was surprised by the robots invasion, technology going against us! It turned into an action movie, with a kinda apocalyptic theme.Now.. let's ask the question: can these two themes coexist, and create a compelling story? Yes it can!The story jusy needs to go for their family story beats, and also the action story beats.But the highlight of the story would be the characters, the characters were an interesting bit, they had some interesting dynamics, with the most developed being the father and daughter, which were kinda tied with the family vs technology theme , which was their source of conflict.The movie started because of their conflict, the daughter, representing the tech side, with an obsession for film, got accepted on film school and was soon going to move out.The father, representing the family side was not happy with that, so he decided to go onto the last family trip togetherA nice little touch was the other 2 characters, mom and the little brothers being the bridge to their characters' resolution.I really liked the characters, and the change they've been gone through, a big plus for me.At the end of the day, the movies visuals were groundbreaking, and the story was good. With its message not being ""reject technology"" or ""live in the woods"" but its more like ""technology and family can coexist, and they can even help each other""",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Knowing this, the robot overlord luckily doesn't change its robots programming to stop that.Cages holding the captured humans luckily have the unlock mechanism right inside the cages.The super-phone containing the robot overlord is luckily not water-resistant.Movies based on this (known as deus ex machina) are pointless since any difficultly can be instantly resolved without any action by the film's characters.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

It tries to show how a dysfunctional family comes together through hardship and in the end, finally understand one another. The dysfunction is comically on the nose and there is no subtlety to what they are trying to portray. If you're an adult, this probably won't resonate with you because of how blatantly obvious the themes are. If you are a child, this sets a completely unrealistic expectation for how the world works. Family dynamics aren't this blatantly obvious and easy to fix, and you're never going to go on some life altering adventure with the people in your life. The characters talk about how it's important to take chances and not play it safe, but they fail to mention that they have indestructible plot armor. There are countless times that these characters should have died, but made it out without a scratch. Life isn't just one comically happy ending where everything works out fine. More often than not, life is brutal. I understand that this is a cartoon and not meant to be taken seriously, but that's not how kids operate.

264,truthbrarian,Good but visually overwhelming movie,8,23 May 2021,"I feel like this is the first animated movie I can genuinely say was made by millennials/genx towards the ""zoomer"" (or smartphone) generation and you can definitely see the effects both mostly good and sometimes bad.For me in the GenX generation, the action sequences were truly amazing but often hard to comprehend with comic books scribbles everywhere, giant colorful complex paintings randomly shoved in your face, robots flying all over the screen, and so many screams, internet memes and loud noises it was sometimes sensory overload. In a way I didn't like how the movie was 11/10 intensity the entire time. I felt tired during the one hour mark and decided to take a break to make popcorn and then I had fun again.The visual style of The Mitchell's & The Machines was entertaining though and the kind of fresh experimentation that Hollywood is sorely missing.I empathized with the daughter character, she was so passionate about going to Film School, while I never did go myself, I dreamed of doing it and her feelings were very close to mine at that age, really well written character. While this family is considered ""dysfunctional"" I thought they could have been a lot worse of people, they at least were always there for each other. The mother was hilarious! So overall I liked the characters.Our villains were pretty solid, they provided a good challenge and were a fun parody of current tech industry trends. Interestingly, the message of the film here was similar to Joker's ""stop treating each other like disposable trash"".Why I have given a 8/10, there were two plot holes, the father was unbelievably computer illiterate, also the art college looked really bad, nothing like Los Angeles and more like Boston that's just a nitpick.That said, I still recommend The Mitchells vs. The Machines!

It also helps that 92% of the jokes land right on target. Did I mention that it also has a disarmingly astute emotional core?Honestly, at this rate Sony Pictures Animation may be beating Disney and Pixar at their own game.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

268,elliottlecointe,"No exaggeration from the reviews, this movie is phenomenal in every way & hit me right in the heart",10,5 May 2021,"I need to go off, this movie was something else. Ignore me if you want.I loved every single thing about this movie. When I first saw this in my Netflix feed, I thought nothing of it. I never heard about the movie before I saw it. No news of it and I never even saw any reviews of it. I immediately thought it was something like Wonderpark or the Emoji Movie or Ugly Dolls. I immediately passed it off until someone on here praised it. I looked it up on IMDB and RT and it had great reviews. I just finished and after writing this, I am immediately gonna rewatch it.I connected with this movie. It parallels my life so much right now. Katie, a film loving teenage girl who struggles to connect with her dad is excited to go to University soon to be with people who are exactly like her. She has a little brother who is hilarious and a mum who is embarrassing yet caring and loving. Not to mention the dumb dog.Change her to male and we're the same character, thats basically my life right now. I have a hilarious little brother who is a great friend. A dumb dog who I love to bits. Two caring parents who sometimes, I struggle to connect with. A character who is going to university to study their passion. I'm off to Uni in September. Not to study film but it almost was what I was taking actually. I just connected with this so much and there were moments where I got teary eyes.This movie is hilarious. Every joke lands and none of them feel forced. They feel organic and they fit the overall tone and aesthetic of the movie. The gags in the background fit the movie so well and I always had a smile on my face watching it.The animation, dear god the animation was gorgeous. Its battling with a Silent Voice right now for best looking animation right now and I think it might win. The lighting, the settings, the character design, everything about how it looked was incredible.Another thing about the jokes is that I think it really handled Internet jokes and Gen Z jokes so so so well. In movies like Ralph Breaks the Internet or the Emoji Movie failed to this because they focused on using the Internet and memes as the concept of the story and it feels forced. With this movie, it felt organic and funny because it wasn't the focus. The focus was on the family which was right.The story is fun, the robots were great, the villain was fun, not to be taken seriously but a good villain I think.I am giving this movie a A+, 10/10, 5 Stars, whatever. I loved this movie to pieces.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
269,babbjanice,This movie is so amazingly chaotic and I love every second of it.,10,25 June 2021,"This is a wholesome movie about a weird, barely functional, family that take on the task of saving the world. It made me laugh so much I almost choke on my Nutella toast, and cry every time they had a heartfelt family scene.The animation in this is amazing, it's very different from other animated films I've seen so far in my life. Sometimes things and their texture feel out of place, which I'm guessing was done to keep with the ""don't fit in""/weird feeling of the family. The soundtrack also goes hard and wraps up the whole vibe of the movie along with the little inside animations/sketches of the film.Sincerely, just watch this movie.

272,E-Hortn,All emotions on board!,9,14 May 2021,"As I write this review on my smart Phone, I tap and swipe, whilst sitting on the toilet. According to latest movie I watched, that would be a big ""NO NO""!I am a father of two, married and drive a family station wagon. I have a full time work and late one friday eavning, I watched ""The Mitchells vs the Machines"".I was tired, and started the movie on a single tought: Nothing better to watch, this will do...I had seen the title and watched parts of the trailer. But I was not ready for what was to come.It kind of reminded me of gumball, a series my oldest kid introduced me to. This kind of wierd machup of live videos, reality mixed up with cartoons. And I think it was a good thing, because it set me up to have an open mind. Prepare for anything and everything!And that is what this movie is all about. Slapstick jokes, your daily dose of internet, wierd stuff, emotions and warm fluffy feelings. It's like an Orchestra of what I can find on Youtube. Good or bad.But whitout the fuzz of having to deal with commersials or ""reacts to"".And with an open mind, I was hooked.It's not perfect, I'll give you that as an heads up.But I think it can be something for everyone in a family. From dad, mom, grandma and kids.I laughed and cried, both at the same time.It could be this stupid punchline or that slapstick joke combined with me beeing tired. But I really enjoyed every part of it.From all mentioned above, down to the core of the story: Family, and father/daughter relationship. What do you do as a father when your kid grows up, and you loose that way of having a good connection. When she was a kid, you were best pals. You could play games, laugh, be best buds and you could be the safe place when she was sad. ""Love you dad, love you kiddo!""
Then she turned 15, and you went from beeing best dad to most embarassing dad.That is the core of this film, and that is what I loved most about it. A silly and stupid animated movie, making me laugh so hard I started crying. And also a deep story about a family, about a doughter and her dad, that also made me cry.Loved it, absolutley loved it.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

I have seen better quality from shows like South Park.The son's voice sound way too much like an adult which is kind of creepy.The story has been way over done before including the recent Next Gen.The animation styles and quality is all over the place. It give it either and amateur made or unfinished feel.Positives:
It at least does a decent job at trying to keep entertaining and appealing to it's target audience. I would of gave it a higher rating if not for the negatives I mentioned.

Sony is cashing on this phenomenon but it will likely only make headway in the North American marketplace.

I am not the target audience for this movie.That being said, I was going in with hopes that it would be close to as good as Into the Spiderverse (maybe a ridiculous assumption as that was one of the best films the year it came out). It was definitely not that.The robots/blow-y up-y bits were really fun. But the whole family tension thing... not for me. And it's not that I don't appreciate that stuff done well, it was like it was every other scene... so much of the movie was devoted to the family drama aspect that the overall plot and the stakes of it felt a bit hollow. There are ways to do both effectively, like The Incredibles. But this just came off as preachy, overly wordy, and very direct.But overall it was a fine movie, the animation was great, it was actually really witty with some kinda wild adult humor at times (cthulhu furby? Yes, please!). Just wish it was a bit less on the nose with it's family message and let the whole plot breathe more.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
295,silvern-92847,Absolutely hilarious and completely heartwarming,10,13 May 2021,"This is one of the best animated films I've seen in years. Sony pictures animation is legit in Disney/Pixar you better look out! This is one of the funniest animated films I have ever seen. My wife and I kept having to rear wind it and watch scenes again they were so funny. The humor here should be universal because it's not basic humor it's like humor from a seasoned pro comedian Who just has a gift and everyone laughs. The comedy has perfect timing and placement speed everything. This movie is a well-willed machine of laughs and truly lets you empathize with the characters and what they represent and is certainly relatable and overarm major arching themes. As you get close to the characters it's a little bit of an emotional roller coaster and is completely within the purview of real life which may be is what makes it so touching and why it resonates with me and our ideas of family. This movie just hits the spot and every way possible the sound and animation are impeccable and they CGI combined with the drawn on screen type graphic, works amazingly well. As does their stop and start timing of sound and music and resignation and fruition of small comedic and emotional seeds that bloom into bigger ideas. This is creative art done perfectly well that it just makes you laugh out loud and empathize and relate with the characters if they send multiple good messages. I cannot give this phone high enough praise. In terms of recent film which has been lacking a little bit of depth like this does and I'm not just talking about plot death I'm talking more about the subtext of the plot even if it is simple. This is a joy ride where the hits just keep on coming and coming. What I mean about the complexity is this film is that the combination of elements required to make such a great film at so many levels is what makes it so fantastic. Not that it has a deeply complex plot or anything like that but that the sound the animation the writing the direction the production the timing the concept the art department everything just comes together perfectly and Sony fires on all cylinders and absolutely nails this film and something that I completely did not expect. This movie hit me hard and unexpectedly and was absolutely awesome and deserves all the credit.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

300,luisafrugoli,A Good Laugh and I Teared Up A Bit,8,9 May 2021,"This movie is absolutly fantastic in terms of comedic timing and animation stylization. It is the first movie to do jokes with modern technology that did not do a SINGLE joke that made me cringe, all of them felt natural - except that one with the primate meme, that was the only one that felt forced, but all the other jokes really came together naturally. The awkward moments are funny but if that's not your kind of humour there are still many funny gags that don't rely on awkwardness.The movie has a generic family plot, but it works just fine and it doesn't need to be innovative for it to be a fun watch. It's all very good.There is a minor reveal at the end about Katie's character that really should have been built up better throughout the movie, we barely get hints about it and most of the people watching it will completly forget this aspect of her character - which sucks since it could have put her on a place where many people watching would perhaps see a bit of themselves in her since it's a marginalized group. The climax drags a little bit too and two characters could have been handled differently during it - but I reveal too much about the characters I'll end up getting into spoiler territory and I do not wish to do that. I also wish some of the jokes during the road trip plot could have been more abrupt because it would only amplify their impact - but hey, this criticism might as well be nitpicky at this point.Anyways, please go watch this movie, stop comparing it to Spiderverse and have your fun.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

308,ToothlessAlphaMode,One Heck of a Surprise,9,8 May 2021,"I am writing this review with my thoughts still fresh, as I only finished the movie ten minutes ago.I haven't written reviews in a shockingly long time, but this movie of all movies, surprisingly was the one that inspired me to start writing again.Now, time for the review.The animationThis movie's animation is stellar. It's gorgeous. I can see Sony played with some of the ideas from Into The Spiderverse, but this animation plays a surprisingly significant roll in the film. The main character, Katie, is one quirky teenager, and the animation really fits in with her personality, which is nice because the movie is narrated by her.Animation: 9/10 - freaking gorgeous.The storyThe story isn't really unique, as I'm sure we've all seen the ""rebellious/misunderstood teen and the very bad at communication/I have never used a computer before type of dad, but it handles these themes really well. The story was kind of slow, bumpy and uneven near the start, but at the end I applauded for as long as I could. The payoff is amazing, though it might just a tiny bit have stretched on for too long.The story: 7/10 - pretty darn good, also quite emotional I may add.The humorThe humor. I will not say anymore about it. It's so good it bumped this review up by one star. Just go watch it for a good time.Humor: 10/10 - missed a few times but DAMN it's funny.Character developmentI love the characters. They have their own personality, but aren't entirely two dimensional and each have their own moment. I loved to see the interaction between Katie and her father, and I absolutely love it when the emotional parts hit.Character development: 8/10 - fleshed out charactersBefore I go, I want to say, this movie does so well tying up loose ends and emotional parts. Without spoiling, parts at the beginning show up near the end as well, and it is a very nice surprise.Overall, an amazing family movie, movie or anything really.

310,press-31193,"""The Mitchells vs. The Machines"" - Using Art to Save the World Maria Elena Gutierrez""The Mitchells vs. The Machines"" - Using Art to Save the World by Maria Elena Gutierrez",10,14 May 2021,"The Mitchells vs. The Machines sends a dysfunctional family on a road trip across the United States, then almost immediately plunges them into a cataclysmic robot uprising. Bursting with comedic energy, the film plays with mixed media and a sketchy animation style, artfully subverting expectations about what an animated feature should look like.Expectations are further upended by the storyline. In the current round of mainstream Hollywood movies, we are bombarded by stories about ""perfect"" superheroes. Such films present their creators with a difficult challenge: how to make their superpowered characters relatable to an audience of ordinary people who will never in their lives be able to leap over tall buildings or fly faster than a bullet.With The Mitchells vs. The Machines, however, writer-directors Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe have channelled a different kind of superpower: their own understanding that, in the real world, misfits are far more commonplace than superheroes. Celebrating ""weirdos,"" Rianda and Rowe have chosen as their protagonists a group of ordinary people. The heroism of Katie Mitchell and her quirky family lies in the everyday dimension. It is their very imperfection that makes them relatable, and we as an audience find their flaws endearing because ultimately we all feel that we ourselves are flawed.Of course, the very goofiness of the Mitchell family also provides an endless source of entertainment - rightly so, since this is, after all, a family comedy. The filmmakers exploit the humor of bathos and hyperbole, permitting their characters to note with dry comic timing that, while some families are grappling with organising their family photo albums, or dealing with picky eaters, the Mitchells have to manage a robot apocalypse. Pop culture references abound, from youth-friendly commentary on the politics of social media, to evocations of classic movies that are sure to please the more mature crowd -
In Pal's geometric core there are echo's of Stanley Kubrick's monolith from from 2001: A Space Odyssey.Hidden beneath this sense of fun is a simple but profound message of reassurance: that it is okay to be odd. This idea is supported by the circular nature of the Mitchell family's strange odyssey, which begins with the suggestion that their weirdness is something that sets them apart. At the end of the film, however, as we listen to young Katie Mitchell's speech about why humanity should be saved, we see how this family of misfits has transformed itself into something special and magical. This shows us that the magic exist in our every day lives. We just have to look at it through the right lens. ""Weirdness,"" it seems,
is what makes us unique.Turning our attention to the Mitchells' neighbours - an image-obsessed superhero family call the Poseys - we might even detect echoes of an everyday cultural struggle in which working class people live in passive envy of their apparently perfect upper class counterparts. Social media addicts derive pleasure from both watching and being watched, and so the relationship between 'weird' mother Linda Mitchell and her 'perfect' counterpart Hailey Posey can be read as a model of mimetic desire. The relationship endures to the end - when Hailey finally demonstrates her new-found acceptance of Linda by allowing the Mitchell mother to follow her on Instagram, the irony of this gracious gesture is all too apparent.This particular dynamic delivers its own share of entertainment to an audience that knows what it is to be the underdog. Watching the film, we experience a certain sado-masochistic pleasure not only in seeing the Mitchells triumph over their adversaries, but also in sharing the various torments they endure themselves.Yet The Mitchells vs. The Machines also presents us with another juxtaposition: that of a natural world built on love and human values, in contrast to the technological realm of Silicon Valley and social media, where people are caught up in endless images of themselves, not who they really are.In their own different ways, therefore, the individual members of the Mitchell family are battling not only to defeat the robots, but also to find their true selves. One such route to self-discovery lies in the space of memory - presented in vibrant form throughout the film. By immersing ourselves in the past, we discover a state of being that is more genuine than the cultural state in which we find ourselves today, and within which we can ultimately achieve enlightenment.The Pater familias (father of the family), Rick Mitchell, seeks such knowledge through his love of nature. A modern-day Luddite, he advises his movie-obsessed daughter, Katie, to look at the world not through her camera lens but with her own eyes, which he describes as 'nature's camera.' And so Rick's world view aligns closely with the film's assertion that technology in the wrong hands can be lethal. At the same time, it portrays the tension between father and daughter. Fearful as he is, Rick wants only to protect Katie - part of his journey is learning that the best way to do this is to let her go.Through all this, it is Katie's philosophy that ultimately prevails. From her position at the heart of the story, this young girl instantly presents herself as a storyteller, as she attempts to escape reality through the medium of cinema. Katie's youthful enthusiasm for zany imagery and crazy ideas is mirrored in the dynamic visual style of The Mitchells vs The Machines. Is she in fact the alter ego of the film's directors? It is hard to argue against the idea.Katie's agency in the story is further reinforced by her status as an openly gay character. With seemingly effortless ease, The Mitchells vs The Machines succeeds in broadcasting and celebrating her sexuality - often through simple visual devices such as the rainbow button she wears - while at the same time never drawing undue attention to it. It is rare for the LGBQT community to be represented so naturally in a Hollywood film - especially an animated feature - and this subtle balancing act is to be applauded.As the robots threaten to overwhelm the planet, it is Katie's passion for art - and her father's eventual recognition of arts value - that saves the day. From the beginning, the film demonstrates that Katie's way of knowing herself and understanding reality is through her art - which she perceives as an expression of her weirdness. And so, it is Katie who teaches us the lesson that lies at the heart of The Mitchells vs The Machines: that art will not only save us in the end, but it will heal us, too.Dr. Maria Elena Gutierrez is the CEO and executive director of VIEW Conference, Italy's premiere annual digital media conference.

312,jasobres,Best animated film of 2021? I certainly believe so!,10,12 May 2021,"I first heard of this title the day it was released. There was so much praise for it from many different animators and celebrities I follow on Twitter. When I finally watched it, I definitely saw why. This film comes from the minds behind some of my favorite things, including Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie, and Gravity Falls! The animation is definitely top-notch, and I love how it blends CGI with live-action stock footage and photos, puppetry, and hand-drawn animation! I also really love the concept of putting a dysfunctional family against a robot apocalypse. The only thing I could do without was the casting of Chrissy Teigen as the snooty perfect next-door neighbor. She can't really voice act her way through a paper bag. So, Ms. Teigen, don't quit your day job. (Wait, what even IS your day job other than being Mrs. John Legend?) Anyhoo, I feel sorry for the other animated films coming out this year.

They're hit and miss but I trust them most of the time when they say something is good. So I took a peek and was immensely disappointed by the writing, characters and plot.

344,Diana_Arus,"Fun watch, but watch with a kid.",2,23 June 2021,"I'm very weirdened out by the overwhelming positive ratings on different platforms this movie has! But then I thought about it and realized, maybe this movie isn't for me. The thing is, I don't know who is it for. If I was to rate it the same way I rate Disney or Pixar or Dreamworks movies, I'd give it a 1. But maybe this movie is made for children and only for children, in this case it's a solid movie. But if it was trying to be of higher caliber like its peers, then I'm afraid it doesn't do it for me. And since it's rated 18+ then I guess it's not for children...The plot is painfully predictable, the story is generic, the qualities of the protagonist is recycled from every and each movie you've seen in the past decade, the 'modern' touch has always been cringy to me but I'm not judging the movie for this as I understand it's a personal preference. And the 'funny scenes' aren't really funny. The only redeeming quality this animated feature has is the great animation! The style is very lovely and refreshing, even if generic, but has a personal touch on it. Other than that, it's nothing special, and if I wasn't working while watching it I would have probably paused and watched it some another day then forget about it.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
345,vanwel-98077,How are so many people giving this a 10?,4,4 May 2021,"The animation is the only saving grace of this movie. The story is cliche and half decent at best, the humor is absolutely terrible, so many cringe moments, the writing is mediocre. There's so many plot holes and plot contrivance, yes it's a cartoon but that doesn't mean you throw all logic out the window; 1.the robots malfunction when the see dogs that means they should have all malfunctioned due to the outstanding amount of dogs in existence, you want to tell me the mitchells are the only people who own a dog in this universe
2. A device that can be used to bypass the cages is literally put inside the cages and the one thing that can open just happens to be thing the Mitchells have been carrying. How the hell did the mother even know about the device, nobody tells her and yet she is able to free herself
3.the mother suddenly gains super strength and beats the bad robots. WTF!!So many other things don't make sense. The rating was very misleading and I went into this expecting a great movie. If it wasn't for the animation I'd give this a 1. It might be fun for kids but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to adults.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

It feels like they tried to recreate the mix that ""spiderman into the spiderverse"" did, but it is badly executed, mixing 3D, comic style drawings, meme style drawings, camera/first person view, etc etc.The humour is bad. Really bad, full of cliché, stereotypes and frankly feels like they forced themselves to be funny. Idem with the ""emotions"" .The story is so bad it made me wonder if the script was made by teenagers. Since the movie was on Netflix, I skipped almost half of the scenes, either boring or cringey.Ultimately I also don't understand how the hell this movie has a 8 on imdb, and I question how legitimate are the other reviews.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
348,PranitPalSinghGulati,A Definite Best Animated Feature Oscar Nomination Film for Next Year,8,20 May 2021,"Produced by the amazing Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the amazing producers of the excellent Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse, The Mitchells vs The Machines is a heartwarming, family comedy with wacky jokes. The voice cast is amazing, Abbi McBride as Katie who gives an excellent voice for her character. Danny McBride's character Rick's character development is so good and his voice also fits the voice of Rick Mitchell. Director of the film Micheal Rianda however as Katie's younger brother Aaron sounds a bit like an adult but there is still a bit of childish impressions in there. Maya Rudolph's character Linda Mitchell ruled the film! I can't talk much about her character as it would spoil the movie. Eric Andre as Mark Bowman's voice was excellent even though he had less screen time. Olivia Colman as the villain Pal was nice to hear. Moving on to the plot, both titles Connected and The Mitchells vs The Machines fit the plot in some way but the main plot was the robot invasion and the relationship of Katie and Rick was a subplot so the title Netflix went with made more sense. The plot was interesting about a family on a cross-country road trip and then they are the last people left to save the world from a robot invasion is awesome but the latest trailer growed it's predictability due to the coronavirus which was such a disappointment as the animation is awesome just like Into the Spider Verse. Some of the jokes did not work but still it will definitely be nominated for best animated feature at the Oscars in 2022. This film gets an 8.6 from me. The Mitchells vs The Machines is a must watch and watch it with your family this weekend even though it has almost been a month it has come out. Make sure not to miss the ending as it is so emotional to see Rick and Katie's relationship grow.

Like it or not, technology is a bit to blame on that, but thats besides the point.This is a movie with a purpose to be launched in 2021 and that's one of the biggest honors I can give to a piece of art.But enough with all this serious talk, this movie has other qualities. It's incredibly funny and looks really gorgeous. The camera angles were particularly good and the edition was greeeat.

And the animation style is perfect for the movie's comedic tone. It also has some emotional moments that work. But while the exposition is great, setting up the emotional beats throughout the plot, the actual story could be more fleshed out. And the movie is also a little longer than necessary, I feel.

Any OK animation depicts imposible plausible, but this movie aced the impossible implausible.

However the third act is so lame and generic that ultimately ruined the movie for me and that's a shame because until that point I was enjoying it. A family of imbeciles facing thousands of robots and defeating them is really stupid even for a kids movie. Moreover, focusing so much on the father-daughter bond and the misunderstandings between them was also really tiring and oveplayed. Lord and Miller improved this movie with their involvement, without them it would be like the other unwatchable Sony Pictures Animation movies. All in all I expected this animated movie to be special because of the high rating but that's not the case, it had potential but it disappointed me in the end.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

378,DimmySz,Light family comedy to watch on that tiring end of the day.,7,3 May 2021,"I am not an expert in analyzing animations, but I will try.I had heard about this film only at the end of last year, although it aroused my curiosity and I didn't have many expectations, I think that's why I really liked the film.Before I start I want to comment with sony animations has been doing better projects since the generic Emojis film. The positive points of this work are several, ranging from technical quality to characters. Technically speaking it is beautiful, the film has a comedy tone and a very youthful and cool animation style that works, a montage that favors comedy and drama, although it has some jokes that didn't work very well with me, and the drama part it works very well, knowing when to take it seriously or not, when the film becomes a self-parody yields very good jokes,
Although I don't think I am the right person to analyze the voice works since I can only differentiate if it is very bad or very good, so I will not be able to go as deep as I would like. That said, I liked the characters more, all of that family I can relate to in some way, Katie's love of cinema, Aaron's passion for dinosaurs, Rick's affection for nature, Linda's unconditional love for her children and the extreme cuteness of Pug Monchi. The villain is a very cool thing in this, first: she is voiced by Olivia Colman, second: she has a valid motivation, abandonment, which is something that is very explored in the film within the Mitchell family.Only two things bothered me about the film, the '' violence '' and some plotters. I left the word violence in quotes because the situations that the family goes through would be impossible not to get hurt in any way, and since the rating is G, the filmmakers could not put very strong scenes.Although the script is good, sometimes there is the feeling that something in the middle doesn't make much narrative sense, like the shopping scene, the villain could have sent her entire army of robots to pick up the family, but she preferred appliances to going after them, even though she has the underestimated could send a little better warpower. There are still other script inconsistencies that I would like to comment on but then I would have to enter the spoilers zone.In resume: The Mitchells vs. The Machines is a light family comedy to watch on that tiring end of the day and maybe get a little emotional.Note: 7,7 / 10,0.",The Mitchells vs the Machines
379,bilyeujaydan,Better than what I expected.,8,17 May 2021,"When I saw the trailer for this back when it was still called ""Connected"" I thought that this was gonna be a commentary on how ""Technology bad"" but it was actually kinda the opposite. On top of that, it made me laugh so many times which is pretty good for a kids film (Saying how most of them are just toilet humor which isn't really my thing). In all it was a pretty good film but had some flaws like Aaron's voice actor sounding nothing like a kid or the villain not being very interesting, but it was a good watch.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

We were all glued to the tv the entire time and everyone walked away saying what a great movie it was and that we'd watch it againOf course it predictable. The family that isn't getting along have to fight an army of robots to save the world. Did you think they'd stay estranged and die fighting the robot hoards thereby dooming the human race?

I can't even count how many times I bursted into laughter out loud. I feel like most modern animated films stunt cast with names who don't match their characters - not this film. Brilliant casting! Last but not least, a unique and fresh animation style. Everything looked detailed yet still ""loose"" in a painterly style.

The boomer humor won nothing but grimaces and second hand embarrassment from my family, and I felt really bad about recommending it based off reviews. I hated the outdated gimmicks, script and dialogue so much it completely overpowered the excellent textures and animation. It kind of reminds me of the humor of that dreamworks film Home tbh.

Definitely a man child. The dude definitely owes the daughter a laptop, a phone, and god knows what else. He was obsessed with being noticed/ validated by his grown up daughter, which I cannot stress is normal, but every coming of age film makes the child look selfish. Even though the parents probably acted the same as their parents. I'm confused why the dad didn't care as much for the son of his wife. Anyway, he was the worst part of the film for me. I couldn't watch it all cos it wound me up.As lastly, the film was too long for my attention span (roast myself as an older gen z) had to quit Netflix in the last 30 minutes, so did they save the world?

It was so humorous. Some of the jokes might be a little cringe but hey it is an animation. It should be intended for kids not for us, adults, who cam differentiate between the jokes. The animation was on point. Music was on point. The idea was awesome and it really made me cry a little because I thought about my parents and our road trips, even if they trips wheren't as awesome as the Mitchells' one.Everyone should give this one a chance and remember the beautiful time they spent with their parents or if they were unfortunate, at least learn how to behave with their future kids or behave in general.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

This movie genuinely holds some of the best hilarious scenes and snippets I have seen in a very long long time. I laughed so much, and suddenly I realized I haven't laughed and felt such a joy from watching a movie in a while... Believe it or not, this movie is a pure joy elixir!As a family man, a father of both a boy and a girl, there were some scenes that even managed to move me, and made me think of them, and how much I love them and happy to have them in my life, and that I would really do anything to keep them safe.

401,allisonjx,Aggressively #American,3,7 May 2021,"I had to pause and go do something else about 3 times before I could finish the whole thing because everything was either too cringey or frustrating. The dad was incompetent and bullheaded who absolutely could not handle his own precious baby daughter having! Her own personality! And interests! And the teenager was so stereotypically teenager that it's like whoever wrote these characters was an alien who never interacted with an actual human before and learned about humans by watching other movies with cringey dialogue and one dimensional characterization. And they definitely have beef with technology and social media. I've never felt such strong desire to stop watching an animation before. Who was the intended target audience for this? Children? Gen Z? Gen Z will laugh at this and spit in its face. They've seen better content on tiktok. Not even gonna talk about how the Mitchells were the only ones in the entire world who didn't get captured. (jk I am). Because really. Out of 7.8 billion humans? Really? It's shown that these robots aren't capable of detecting humans who are hiding behind objects so...how'd they get everyone underground?I'm honestly confused by the high ratings... Some reviewers were even saying that this was as good as Into the Spiderverse. No way. Forget about being on the same level, the two aren't even in the same building, or even the same country, for that matter. Nothing about this was creative or unique.Wanted to give this a 1 star but the animation is honestly amazing, the 2 robots were actually funny (but were the only funny things in the movie), and I'm glad to finally see a good sibling bond portrayed in media. But that's it. Would not even show this to my own children.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

403,goldenkirby,Fun movie almost entirely.,8,30 May 2021,"The Mitchells vs. The Machines (TMVTM) is great on first watch. However, you be the judge on your second watch. While TMVTM makes pop culture references, they do it in a way that doesn't feel odd or cringe in your first viewing. The first time you watch TMVTM will probably be a good one. The jokes are funny, the writing is nice, the plotline is original and executed great. The character design and the effects in between the movie is great and adds the extra feeling that the movie is from Katie's perspective. But to be honest, I could care less about whatever the song is that has Katie and the father dancing at the end, that is about the only weirdness. But remember, I said the first go around is great. The second, to be honest, you of course can expect what happens. But the second viewing doesn't give you the same feeling as the first viewing, which really sucks. This could just be me and some people, and if you can watch it over and over against and love it, great. The second viewing lost its magnetic attraction it gave me to the first viewing. Overall, the movie is great your first viewing. There isn't much to complain about, and it is just fun to watch. But be warned, the second viewing especially won't be the same.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

I was blown away. The animation is incredible. I loved the characters. I found them relatable and very easy to connect with. The story was handled very well, and paced perfectly. There wasn't a dull moment. It was the funniest film, hands down, that I have seen in at least 2 years. I found myself missing jokes because there were sequences where they just didn't stop, and I was doubled over laughing hysterically. It's got a quirky spin, which I love.

To start off, it delves heavily into the meme culture, and while the meme are dated, they would be no matter what.The weakest point of the movie is the basic story--it isn't new nor revolutionary, which is a bit of a shame realizing that the writers were connected to Gravity Falls and Alex Hirsch was the story consultant. That being said, I do think fans of Gravity Falls would probably really enjoy this film.For me, the humor shined. What some may consider trying too hard at being quirky is par for the course for this writing team. The humor helped elevate a mediocre story into something enjoyable. Add in some touches of nostalgia, a few pointed stabs at social media and technology consumption, and a voice cast that delivers (many don't care for the directo stepping in to voice the brother, which is understandable, but I didn't mind), and it's a fun romp.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

New technologies are central to the play and the message is there: well used, they are the ally of a healthy personal and common development, which cultivates the inner child that lies dormant in us.

439,pencilshavings-39720,Disappointingly bad.,3,5 May 2021,"I'm genuinely surprised on how even some critics think this movie is good in general. Even as a kids movie it's really bad.The few good things I can say about it is it's high budget animation and its creative stylistic designs. However, the other ""qualities"" I have to say are far from similar.First of all, the sound design and mixing is really awful. I can't tell why newer movies such as the recent Tom and Jerry seem to face this problem also.The movie wants to take itself seriously and also wants to make the viewer laugh at the same time and it fails at it miserably. For an odd reason this movie reminds me a lot of the movie ""Home"". With its same annoying characters and flashy designs. It also is similar to home in the fact that they both wanted to do the exact same thing, the only difference is that this movie did it slightly better in some aspects and is way more praised for it.It was clear from the beginning that this movie was going to ""Capitalize on the modern generation"" of people. Don't want to spoil, but I'm sure even the people who won't admit it know how hard this movie is trying to relate with certain groups of people directly.And finally, I dislike how the whole plot in general starts and ends. But I'm sure you'd already have figured that out.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

The animators seemed to know what they were doing and you can pause frame by frame to understand that. The 2D and 3D combination was done gorgeously even anime struggles to do that.

Unfortunately my ""Katie"" was off chatting with her online friends in her room, and my ""Aaron"" was watching with one eye on the movie and one on Minecraft. Sigh.There were some really hilarious parts. The studio did great with animating some of the characters (family dog is amazing), but other animations just didn't fit, like the dad's legs. And what TOTALLY didn't fit was Aaron's voice. He looked like he was about 8 but talked like he was about 15 or 16.

What felt wrong was the pacing. An 1:53 movie is probably too long for a kids movie. I watched this with my kids, and had to stop early because it ran so long. We were well into what felt like the third act and climax, and I stopped to see how much was left, and there was still more than a quarter of the movie left to go when it should have been maybe 10% max.

Unbelievably good styling. I don't think I've ever seen anyone combine the 3d styling of Illumination with cell shading that reminds me of a super high res TF2. Very fluid animation, very fun articulation of the character, absolutely beautiful scenery. The emoji style bursts really rounded out the visuals.The Story:
Fun beyond reason. Very well paced humor and every joke landed perfectly. Was the concept recycled? Sure. But lets be honest, what concept isn't?Overall Rating: If I could give this an 11/10 I would do so without question. I don't think I've ever seen a more soulful movie and I hope we see more from this studio.Not going to lie, I ended this movie with tears in my eyes because of how much I loved it.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Yes there was cheesy lines and it was predictable but from the eyes of a kid it was relatable, colorful and funny. Talking about the pug lol.

463,heroes-anthem,Watched this movie late at night and still didn't enjoy it,5,3 May 2021,"The animation was wonderfully done. Most of the good comedic moments came from the animated popups that would appear on screen a la Zombieland/Spiderverse; hats off to the animation team.The rest of the movie was so derivative that it was on the point of parody, which would have been great had that been intentional. It attempts to be some kind of combo between Zombieland, The Lego Movie, and i,Robot but doesn't commit to what made those movies successful within their respective subgenres. So many other films have already done this but executed it much better. It was an example of the current state of many movies being made by bigger studios in the animation industry: the filmmakers knew how they wanted to begin the film and end the film and padded out the rest of the time with lazy, boisterous worldbuilding (think Soul, Inside Out, Frozen 2).",The Mitchells vs the Machines

467,antonio4912,Definitely worth a watch...but I'm a bit disappointed.,7,2 May 2021,"Firstly, I just want to say this movie is gorgeous and stylistic up the wazoo, not a shock for the writing team that helped craft this story. And I do think that it's an overall strong movie with a strong enough cast
, and a fantastically written script with a lot of wit and charm that it feels like an overall productive movie.But...man, the pandemic must've done some work to this movie because the pacing and especially the editing feels all over the place. It feels like some scenes move at breakneck paces while others are too slow, the villain never really seems to be bothered (minus one comedic scene) by the events, and their counter response to the family's actions is written off as a joke, essentially. Plus it feels like the dad and the daughter quite literally go through the same discussion four times in this movie. Does that make sense thematically, sure, but it makes for a movie that feels like it doesn't exactly know what hoop it's shooting for. And there are way, WAY too many jokes with the dog.I think it's a fun enough watch, but I don't think I'll really be playing this over and over again like some other recent animated films.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

What was the casting director thinking? And when something so obvious like that happens, one of two things is going on. Either the shot callers are all morons or the voice actor of that part begged or called in a favor. Hey, dude, it ain't the movie's fault your phone stopped ringing. When you're done, you're done.

The message they are trying to send is nice but it's just too drowned out by everything else. The boys character is literally 'likes dinosaurs too much'. If anything movies like these make kids feel like they should be ashamed for being different. The parents just gave up on their kids only to require the end of the world to find the motivation to reconnect with their kids.The most annoying part is the stupid dog.

Sony Pictures Animation and the duo of producers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, is back after the excellent Spider-Man: New Generation, which already revolutionized animation by creating a new visual language of its own.An apocalyptic comedy that skillfully mixes genres to play with current events and the place of technology in our lives and relationships. Non-stop action, a rare inventiveness, but it is especially its humor that makes this animated feature irresistible! The jokes hit the nail on the head and we soon find ourselves with a smile on our face as we enjoy the wacky adventures of these unusual heroes.The second strength of the film comes from the emotion it gives off. Through its scenario, the story gives a lot of heart and this is felt in each scene. In particular those between Rick and his daughter, Katie, which shows how misunderstandings can create a wall despite an omnipresent love between them. A case in which many will be able to recognize themselves.""The Mitchells vs. The Machines"" beats its competitors to the punch and gets a head start by offering us a welcome revival in the world of animation.Perhaps an ""instant classic"" in the making for new generations, at least I'm a fan and I want more!",The Mitchells vs the Machines

This movie however has a consistent plot and at times is very heartfelt (although sometimes can come across as cringe). Over all a fairly good movie.,The Mitchells vs the Machines

It also helps that 92% of the jokes land right on target.

It's filled with these random pop culture references (Nyan cat, etc) that made me cringe SO MUCH. It's like it was written by some guy that was banned from the internet during the days when stuff like mountain dew and doritos, deal with it, doge and stuff like that were popular. And that's not all. It's full of random plot holes that simply leave you scratching your head. It's also full of stereotypes that many people may find offensive. The only thing I kind of liked about it were two things: the robot's designs looked kind of cool and the scene where they drive to ""Dino stop"" that turns out to be a gas station.

533,ismihan-nazli-suzer,This is not going to be an ordinary review,10,9 May 2021,"This is one of the best animation movies of the last decade. Here is why:The story is incredibly gripping; catchy dialogues; huge humor and touching drama; the great balance between those two genres that also often transitions into action; a very decent twist; innovative animation style; It refers to wide range type of audience; extremely well delivered messages; and lastly... Everything is super relatable.Its fast pace is one of a kind that really stands out among any other blockbuster animations out there and I actually liked it, but it's very easy to miss or not understand some of the fast cut scenes and dialogues. This was my only issue but all the other awesomeness brought out with this movie easily compensates the rest.When it comes to the 'reality police' and 'I-want-to-scream-so-hard' reviewers... Claiming that this is not realistic at all.. The movie actually presents one of the most realistic, relatable and anticipated future stories out there. There are hundreds of other animations that are loved mainly for the execution of the graphics, the fun and certain delivered emotions within a fantasy script that has sub par realistic notions in it. Why don't you go ahead and criticize those instead? You rather give them 9/10 because you were so captivated by the fantasy world your eyes laid on or for some other bullcrap personal reasons. Be real with yourself.Whoa! Out of billions of families in the world, only them, Mitchells get to be left out and get to fight to save the world. What are the chances?! Whatever the chances of witnessing a few number living animals that belong to nearly extinct breed located on earth (endlessly destructed by us humans) :) Everything is possible. Deal with it. And for the love of... whatever you love the most divine...Find better sources to seek realism. And remember this is only a movie. An animation movie. Medium for your soul hence entertainment and meditation or whatever you might want to call it. And nothing about humans nor their creations are perfect and can never be.A lot of the things in the film are Americanized, modernized and were made seem like saving the USA meant saving the world (just like many made-in-USA movies and shows. How surprising!). When all the people were released out of their pods they were held captive in; it looked more like as if it was just the number of people of one city in a state of NA rather than even being one state of people, or the entire NA country not to mention ""the world"".So what?Yes, some parts and details could have been thought off better, but so what? Why all the perfectionism over it? Why all the hilarious nitpicking? Just adapt; sympathize; take what's good; note down the baddies; put them on a scale; then zoom out and look at it again for the overall perspective... Then give your rating. You wouldn't give a movie like this less than 7 out of 10 even if it didn't impress you as much. It is pretty objective to say that those who rated it lower than that have apparent non-viable criticism ethics, because they did it for any other reason but to review it with true eyes, mind and soul.In my sincere opinion, people who disliked this movie or somehow wanted to make it seem like it; rated it low; and wrote harsh criticism about it have serious issues. I can't wrap my head around the idea of how someone can hate an animation movie that has full of blissful, exciting, emotional, eye-tearing of laughter and emotions, and ""I've been there"" moments that also has right on spot humanity and relationship lessons including human psyche rendition. I was shocked not seeing the rating 9 or above. Honestly, this is what's wrong with some people. They simply can't see or accept what actually good or bad is. They also can't empathize, neither can have proper functioning judgment.Don't ever bother reading those ridiculous reviews or get fooled by them. It is a must-to-watch movie.I applaud every single person in the pre-production, production and post-production teams of The Mitchells vs The Robots. Very well-done guys. Respect.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

537,chuppacabbra71,Modern Family Fun,9,2 August 2021,"I have read some of the reviews (less than stellar) and I can't find what is negativity. It's as if they don't have a dysfunctional family or they can't relate to some of the awkward dynamics of the teen / parents adult relationships some family have. Sure is takes an extreme set of circumstances to realize that they all love each other and learn how to finally be supportive while the HAL like AI is trying to take over the world but it's great adventurous fun. Do not pass up the potential of putting a smile on your face. This movie will have you wanting to take a road trip with the family.

I just want to say thank you to the creators for making this movie :DIt's the first time in a long time that I watched and finished a movie with my little brother and sister (sometimes it's really hard to keep them off their phones, you know lol). We used to watch a lot of movies when we were younger. At first, I thought I'd just watch it by myself then my little sister overheard it playing on my tablet, so she joined and eventually, my little brother! This made watching this movie more exciting and extra special :DThe story, the animation, the voice acting, and the soundtrack? Top tier!! Just like what my sister said, ""10/10 would recommend!""This is another great family movie that made me cry. Thanks, creators. No really, thank you!You made this movie something that my siblings and I will definitely remember in a long time that made us laugh, cry and smile.

Me and my adult housemates put it on for an easy watch but I had been anticipating this movie since the same studio that did Spiderman into the spiderverse created this film.The plot was fantastic, the jokes made me slap my knee and laugh incredibly hard multiple times even though it's a kids film.I think some of the reviewers who watch this film aren't aware it's literally for children. I honestly can't rave about this film enough. I've suggested it to all my friends with children as I expect this to be a classic of the next generation.Fantastic job overall and absolutely loved the references to the geo political issues with tech industries and treating LGBTQ+ Characters as human beings without needing to token these characters.10/10 studios could take some lessons from this film especially since the emoji movie came from Sony also.

Some cringeworthy slo-mo's and ""epic"" moments are mostly there for little kids watching this movie, but as a family movie I feel this could have been more thoughtful and cohesive. It felt all over the place emotionally and takes it self too seriously for the subject matter, in my opinion. The scatterbrained pacing gets old in about 5 minutes as it goes at about 1000 miles per hour all the time, with the exception of some sappy underwhelming slower moments. This film is not worth your time, again, in my opinion.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

565,Brukernavn03,"The Incredibles meets iRobot, only cringy",1,8 May 2021,"I was expecting a good movie, given the amount of positive reviews. After seeing it I can't believe they are real. This whole movie is the family version of I'm NoT lIkE oThEr GiRlS. The girl is so weird because she likes movies. The brother is so weird because he's interested in dinosaurs. The mother is weird because she believes in everyone. And the dad is so weird because he likes outdoor stuff. The whole premise is that this family is special because it's not like other families, while everything that is supposed to make them weird or special is as normie as it gets.It attempts to do current day references, but instead of merely referencing, they have to spell it out for you. ""My dad reminds me of that screaming monkey clip. Let me also show you the clip in the actual movie, and even crop his head on my dad."" Very funny humor. All the memes were outdated before they started making the movie.The animation is very good, and the comic infusions are fresh, but sometimes they are too intrusive and take you out of the action or the moment instead of enhancing it. However the sound design does not match the visuals. Especially the music is weak.The movie has two messages, first that we became so dependent on technology and robots that they took over the world and decided to get rid of the inferior humans. Second, that generations have something to learn from each other. The problem with the first message is that there is no solution. At one point the person responsable for the end of the world says it might not have been such a good idea to give away all the data to unregulated companies after all. And the dad agrees, but it allowed his daughter to upload youtube videos, so it wasn't all bad. There is no solution, nothing is changed at the end. The problem with the second message is that the out of touch father closer resembles todays grandparents, not parents of teenagers. And the bonding doesn't feel natural. The final product is something that falls short. It should have kept it's message to either technology or the family, not both.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Attempts to integrate meme culture but sometimes feels awkward and kinda out of place.,The Mitchells vs the Machines
577,shellyglover,Hilarious but also rips off a Veggietale movie,10,5 May 2021,My family loves this movie because it is so stupid that it is hilarious. The only problem is that I think they ripped off a veggietale movie called The Fennel Frontier. On the ship they have a machine called PAL that also interacts like a friend just like PAL on Mitchells vs Machines.,The Mitchells vs the Machines
578,sethandjess-54624,Incredibles for a New Generation,9,2 May 2021,"I'm not usually into the animated shows they crank out yearly, but this one completely surprised me. We watched it with our kids (ages 5-14) and we were all cracking up! The humor wasn't crude-it was genuinely funny. It took a minute for me to get used to the unusual animation, but I loved it by the end. The best thing about it: the heart and the genuine family dynamics and healthy relationship growth. Afterwards my 7-yr-old said, ""that show taught me a lesson-that I need to be nicer to Dad."" You can't say that about many movies today! I highly recommend this one.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Only two of the family members felt like real characters the others were less developed. The direction is not great and characters also look weird.

The animation is so exaggerated and reminds me of cartoons. Each character is lovable and funny. The dialogue was crafted by excellent writers, the jokes are always funny and the plot is great. Each joke produced at LEAST a chuckle, and sometimes I do actually feel it tries too hard, but it is still great. Aaron's VA was off putting at first, since it is a very deep and nasally voice in a little boy, but I grew to love it.

The comedic aspect of the movie is enjoyable and well balanced with the emotional sub plot (that hit way too close to home for me and had me crying like a baby). However, many plot points seem forced and the logic is behind some characters' actions is non existent. My expectations in the story arc were low from the beginning, but certain parts of it seemed so nonsensical to me that I could not fully enjoy it anymore.

I laughed so hard with my kids; despite tons of quirky YouTube/meme references that I typically don't enjoy, the movie uses them as a vehicle to share what my kids are growing up with. I grew up watching Son in law with Pauly Shore, and it just resonated with the scene when the Dad finally crosses over and learns what his son is into.

609,sweetchildj,"Dull, full of plot holes, and unimaginative",2,1 May 2021,"This movie is trying so hard to convince the audience that it is original, clever, and fun that it fails even more miserably than it would just on account of its tested ""dysfunctional family on a road trip formula"". The story is so predictable that I was able to guess not just what happens next, but also the lines of characters basically through the whole movie. It's packed with old pop culture references and bad, overused jokes. The fact that the main characters seem like a bunch of stereotypes on steroids instead of loveable people, and that their relatedness is basically constantly rubbed in the audience's faces doesn't really help. Not to mention that the plot is not really driven by characters' actions, but instead relies on constant ""deux ex machina"" magic, which only gets worse as the movie progresses. The animation seems desperate to be quirky and fun with all of its technique mixing, reminding us at all times that the main character is a child, no, a product of a YouTube and smartphone filter era, experiencing the world through a smartphone lens, a stark contrast to her well-meaning, nature loving father, who is portrayed not only as a complete ignorant when it comes to technology, but also as a totally socially incompetent idiot that doesn't understand that a pink screwdriver is not an adequate wedding anniversary gift. But, hey, every member of our cardboard box family luckily had one, because that was exactly the thing needed to save the world in the end. This movie was so disappointing, boring and annoying, and all those fantastic (Paid, obviously!) reviews were so infuriating that I created an account just to post this review.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

We called our 19 year old out of her room and told her to come sit with us, the stipulation, if she didn't like it she could go back in her room. She stayed. She loved it too. We laughed at some of the very relatable jokes, pointed fingers at who was who in the movie. It was nice to be able to sit down with our older children and enjoy something.By the way, to those that didn't like the type of animation and the storyboard of the movie, it doesn't always have to be over the top. The simplistic type style and design was a great change from the typical animation you see nowadays. This movie was visually appealing. Great Job. Definitely the best movie since the pandemic hit.

The movie trys to give you the pov of the main character, Katie, with different 2d animations sprinkled through, but it doesn't keep to her pov very well and feels weak and watered down most of the time.

619,iridon-18631,Perfect example of what modern animation can be.,10,5 May 2021,"Spiderverse already shattered the standards for animated films, this one takes it to the next level. For too long animated films for kids/families bordered on basic styles that were easy to crank out for what was perceived as a simple audience, but The Mitches Vs The Machines has pride in itself unlike any movie I've seen. Mixed mediums, a 3D movie blocked like traditional 2D animation, and COLORS, oh my god, the colors. The action definitely holds up to their previous work on Spiderverse, and the stylized look lends amazingly well to it as well.The story itself is a little predicable, but that's to be expected with a movie aimed at kids/families, but just because it follows a familiar trend with the plot doesn't mean it's completely void of soul or surprises. They manage to take the traditional formula and update it, give it a more natural flow that feels right. Some of my favorite parts about the movie though is it has every opportunity to become some boomer anti-screen rhetoric about how tech makes us less connected these days, but steers clear of that narrative in favor of a much more wholesome and positive one. Also not to get too preachy, but it does a nice job of representation, Katie is very easily LGBT and in a way that feels organically hinted at, even the most veiled homophobe can't complain about it being ""forced on our youth""I've been following this movie for months, and I can't tell you enough how much it was worth the wait.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

I didn't like spider verse animation style it was eye straining i haven't watched the movie for that reason. But i decided to give the trailer a go. By the end of the trailer i was laughing hysterically. And i decided to watch the movie.It was so witty and the jokes were creative not forcing and story felt close to heart. It's generic topic about family but the interesting part was the premise and crazy family is so much entertaining to watch i didn't expect all this.

But for me the main point is that it kept me laughing the whole way through.Yes, some parts were forced, and yes, there are plot holes. To me that was actually part of the fun! I felt like those moments made for a fun, surreal, over the top experience that actually made me enjoy it all the more.The characters were lovable and portrayed with care.

In general, this cartoon is not bad, it's cool to watch his family, because it raises age-old problems, such as the problems of parents and children, the environment that we change real communication on the phone and in a rather hyperbolized form, tells what it can lead to. Of course there are some nuances, for example the graphics sometimes just get out of control and it was very strange to watch. In addition, we must not forget that this cartoon is still more aimed at younger audiences, because the story is easy and unpretentious, but it raises problems for adults and therefore it is difficult to say which viewer it will suit 100%. But the humor there is very accurate, vital, some moments really funny. The characters are well written, of course the poor little brother is completely forgotten, he is almost gone, but in principle, the conflicts between the characters are very detailed. As for the plot, of course, this is primarily a cartoon and the main twists are provided here, so who is the main thief and how the characters will be weakened, I understood at the beginning of the film. Well, as for the final, of course it all ended with a standard happy end, nothing special.

632,henryneuman-90898,My movie of the year so far!,9,10 May 2021,"Just watched The Mitchell's vs the Machines (formally named Connected) this film was made by the same people who made The Lego Movies and Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse all of which are films I really enjoyed, so going into this film I was optimistic (as always) and I have to say I really enjoyed this film a lot! The film is about a girl named Katie who is going off to college to pursue her career in film making, she and her father Rick seem to have trouble bonding and understanding each other in what they wanted for her, kinda like in a Goofy Movie. Now already I can relate to this character, as a filming major myself she's very creative in what she makes so I can really understand what she wants for herself but at the same time I can't help but feel sympathy for Rick (especially during the climax) because he knows his daughter is growing up and it's really neat how they eventually reconnect with each other within the story. As far as visuals go this film really looks gorgeous from the luscious color pallet to the unique character designs this film looks really well crafted. I have to say Sony is really making some winners in animation, to think this was the studio that made The Emoji Movie, and following up the next year they won an Oscar with Into the Spider-Verse it just shows that Sony really can make good pictures and I'd say they're on the right track!

Animation = 9Plot = 8Character = 10 (especially Katie)Music = 9Is it worth to watch..? Definetly YES!",The Mitchells vs the Machines
652,MrOscarB2021,The Clicher-sons vrs Some Giant Tech Companies,4,6 June 2021,"The funniest thing about the movie is the amount of times it tries to sell the viewer that the Mitchell family is strange or weird when by definition it is the most standard family that exists. It's like watching the family from the sitcom The Middle but in 3D.Where to start? It is a family made up of a clumsy, paunchy father, a submissive mother with a very common job as a school teacher, a daughter, a son and a dog. Even the breed of the dog is so common and standard that it seems that this story was created from statistical data of the most common stuff in the USA.I simply chose to watch this movie because I was struck by the good rating it had, which I found inconsistent with the quality of the movie seen in the trailer. In the end I think it was the same robots that appear in the film that created these 10/10 reviews so that many people thought it was a good film.The Family and the plot are made up of so many clichés, stereotypes, and ordinary characters that I suppose the target audience for which this film was created must be just as ordinary as the Mitchell family.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

654,hellotheremyfrwend,eh,3,8 June 2021,My younger siblings enjoyed it but for me it was just a generic kid friendly comedy trying so so so hard to be different it was cringey.

Although, I did find the animation a little too flashy at times.I liked the family and they did remind me of my family. However, the voice actor for the little brother is really bad and does not even sound like a kid.Overall, I thought the plot was interesting but I feel like the pacing was off and that this was too long for an animated movie. I feel like this movie would have been better if it didn't have all of the robot/sci-fi stuff and just focused on the Mitchell family themselves and their relationship with technology. I would have liked this to just be a nice family comedy instead of a weird sci-fi movie that tries too hard to be funny.",The Mitchells vs the Machines

Wow was I absolutely wrong.The animators hit it out of the park with this one. The animation was creative and they did an outstanding job taking an over-done ""robots take over the world"" plot and giving it a new coat of paint, not easy to do when we've all seen a dozen other movies about robots taking over the world. Kudos to the animation team for not making it feel redundant.I was absolutely hooked throughout this movie and it has easily become one of my favorite animated films. Refreshing story, interesting characters, and laugh-out-loud hilarity (seriously, a few moments had me laughing so hard I was in tears).

668,mlember,faults overweigh the good,4,8 May 2021,"Good animation. I don't enjoy photo/video filters much, but the stylistic approach was at least OK by me.Very weak plot - almost everything works out by chance for the Mitchells. Every 5 minutes they take a leap of faith and it works out.Annoying physics/reality - taken from Marvel's and other superhero movies, where falling from incredible heights or coming to an abrupt stop from a high fall leaves the people a bit dizzy at the worst. A kilometer high structure filled with people falls over and that DOESN'T leave a gory pile of flesh and intestines - instead everybody climbs out happy? A crappy car can jump and fall and crash and is impossible to hit/catch up with super advanced, Ironman style robots? And a ""mother's rage"" is more destructive than T1000 style superfast killer robots, which can nano-assemble or something? And everybody masters the art of skysurfing in a few minutes? Ugghhhhhh. I'm okay with make-believe, I can even accept the pug-bread confusion, but otherwise this was supposed to be ""realistic"" and in our real world, wasn't it?Mediocre characters - I liked that the siblings' relations were friendly and supportive. What was wrong with the father for not having taken interest in his daughter's activities for a decade or so? As others pointed out - it took a literal end of the world for him to find out what his daughter was doing and passionate about. Why?Cultural nods - why not. Missed probably some of those as I used my native language voice-over.Conclusion - a mixture of barely unrelated stuff in a very intense sauce, visually ok/pleasant, but lacking substance and plausibility. I wonder how long I'd last with the people giving this movie 8-10 points? Would be an interesting cultural experience, I guess (and I wouldn't mind being so enthusiastic about something so simple, for a while).",The Mitchells vs the Machines
669,NL_Platypus,A great comedy mocking our dependency on technology,10,25 May 2021,The animation is hilarious and very well done. The story crosses generations and contains an ironic portrayal of people's dependency on technology. I think that a lot people are unaware of the covert influence the big tech companies have in our every day lives. This movie shows that in a very funny way.,The Mitchells vs the Machines

Uprising of robots. In ""Children in the Universe"" robots caught all humans to make them 'happy.'
All simple robots glitched. In ""Children in the Universe"" they couldn't answer a brain-teaser.All advanced robots didn't glitch. In ""Children in the Universe"" they were able to answer the brain-teaser.The family used robot suites to get to the tower.

By the end of the movie my kids told me to turn it off. Why do all politically correct movies have to blame the dad? Inst that promoting a stereotype? You never see movies where the mother is blamed for ignoring her kids, its always the dad being uncaring.

Say goodbye to rich plots, great characters and interesting issues in Family Animation movies, specifically weird/dysfunctional Families, so well represented by The Incredibles , The Addams Family, even The Croods (extending to tv shows, we have The Simpsons, Family Guy, American Dad, etc)Since the Woke mentality has taken over all segments of entertainment, it's about time to infect Animations.Unlike the above mentioned movies, the ""weirdness"" of the Mitchells family is so artificial, so forced, so weak...it's there just to justify the endless (and shallow) messages of ""careness"" for themselves...begging the audience for some emotional connection, but we never get any.They leave from a slapstick/nosense/unfunny situation just to enter into another, even more slapstick/nosense/unfunny situation...and that pretty much summarizes the entire plot.I'm not saying it's a terrible movie...it's just a convoluted (and noisy) emptiness..",The Mitchells vs the Machines

I found it really off-putting and by the end of the movie I was really irritated by it. It's such an easy thing to get right, I can't think why it was allowed to happen (except for the fact he's voiced by the director so I guess it's some sort of vanity project).
