0,bkoganbing,Holy Schnickers!!,7,17 May 2019,"It's hard to believe that Chris Farley would be dead in two years after making
Tommy Boy. This may very well be his comedy triumph and Farley gets some
great support from David Spade and good carefully selected ensemble.Meet Tommy Callaghan, Jr. who is a decent hearted well intentioned klutz of a
human being. But he's skated through life up to now because his dad is the
biggest employer in the town with Callaghan's Auto Parts..Brian Dennehy is Tom, Sr. and he's one of those employers who feels a responsibility to his workers. He hasn't relocated south of the border or to
China to pay less than minimum wage. Dennehy and no pun intended is a
larger than life figure who sadly really hasn't taken his kid in hand.Dennehy also in his middle age has taken a nice trophy wife in Bo Derek with
her son Rob Lowe. Wouldn't you know it on the wedding day Dennehy dies
and if Callaghan Auto Parts doesn't get some leadership it will fold. And with
a new stepmom in the picture, let's just say that Derek and Lowe have a
different agenda.This is Farley's moment to finally grow up and Spade kind of takes him in hand.
But he needs a lot of tutoring.There are a lot of great comedy moments. Two of my favorite are Farley and
Spade on the road with some road kill that doesn't prove to be quite so dead.
The other is Farley and Lowe getting acquainted as new stepbrothers and Farley introducing him to cow tipping, a favorite past time.Lowe shows some great comic talent and I wonder why he didn't take any billing for the part. Kudos also go to Julie Warner playing the girl next door
that Farley likes and to Dan Aykroyd as the business rival of Dennehy who wants to acquire the company. Aykroyd is a great believer in image management.Tommy Boy is a great comedy of the 90s and Chris Farley is really spot on in
this film.",Tommy Boy
1,SnoopyStyle,dynamic duo Farley and Spade,8,21 May 2015,"Tommy Callahan III (Chris Farley) is a dumb good-natured klutz who finally graduates college after seven years. His father Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy) owns a family auto parts empire in Sandusky, Ohio but it's not going well. Nevertheless, Big Tom is taking out new loans to start up a new brake pad factory and marrying Beverly (Bo Derek). Beverly's son Paul (Rob Lowe) is a jerk. Big Tom puts resentful Richard Hayden (David Spade) in charge of looking after Tommy. Tommy reconnects with former schoolmate and shipping manager Michelle Brock (Julie Warner). When Big Tom dies, the bank reneges on the promise loan until Tommy puts everything he owns on the line. Tommy goes on the road to sell brake pads with a reluctant Richard Hayden.Chris Farley is naturally adorable and a great physical comic. He exudes charm. David Spade is his perfect partner with his sarcastic superior manner. The movie excels when the duo is on the screen together. It doesn't work quite as well without both guys together. They are simply a hilarious team.",Tommy Boy
2,kosmasp,Farley and go,8,9 February 2021,"Chris Farley ... for many one of the best comedians and as many say a great human being. I personally am not an expert on his output, but after watching this, I have to say I do understand the praise some threw his way. The way he acts here, the seemless nature of him just being present ... the silliness seems like second nature/skin.The story may be riddled with cliches, but it still works more than nicely. It all comes down to the actors involved. And I am a little bit surprised that I kind of dig David Spade here. Not his biggest fan myself, but he works more than nicely in this one. Get into the silliness mode and sit back, relax and enjoy",Tommy Boy
3,classicsoncall,"""Did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?""",6,21 October 2021,"I have this aversion to watching films starring Saturday Night Live alumni, as they have a tendency to appeal to the lowest common denominator among fans of the show and it's characters. Every once in a while I break from that mind set and catch a film starring one or more of it's former celebrities, and this happened to be the latest. I'll admit that I had to laugh at some of the funnier bits, but over all, the picture confirmed my original thesis about playing down to it's audience. It didn't even look like Chris Farley and David Spade had real great chemistry here, as Farley's character, Tommy Callahan, did all the goofy stuff you expect him to, while Spade's Richard pretty much played the straight man throughout. As for Bo Derek, both of her marriage partners appeared to be a mismatch, maybe not so much for Brian Dennehy, but gee, she looked, and actually was eight years older than Rob Lowe when they made this picture. The only character I actually liked here was Michelle Brock, portrayed by Julie Warner, perhaps because she was the only one that appeared 'normal'. Funny how I have to put 'normal' in quotes, like it's some kind of outlier. Anyway, this was a take it or leave it film for me, although I have to admit (for the second time), that it was a kick to see Chris Farley do a couple of cartwheels in the story. Who would have thought?",Tommy Boy
4,lee_eisenberg,"Thank you, Chris Farley, wherever you are...",10,5 June 2005,"As it turns out, Chris Farley and David Spade only made three movies together (""Coneheads"", ""Tommy Boy"" and ""Black Sheep""), but this was truly the ""Citizen Kane"" of their pairings. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the dimwitted heir to an auto parts company. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires mild-mannered Richard Hayden (David Spade) to look after him. Big Tom is getting married to a ""ten"" (Bo Derek), so everything has to be in order. After Big Tom suddenly dies, Tommy and Richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. From then on, the movie is pretty much an excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best: make a mess of everything.When this movie first came out in the theaters, I saw it with my grandfather. He figured out early on that the Bo Derek and Rob Lowe characters were hiding something. But you can completely ignore that and simply luxuriate in Chris Farley's antics. Nothing is safe around his stomach, and hell hath no fury like his happy-go-lucky attitude. The scene where he sets the cars on fire, and later the deer scene, make for a pure laugh riot. Chris Farley and David Spade were truly the John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their era. It's a pleasure to always be able to think about ""Fat guy in a little coat"" time and again.",Tommy Boy
5,Quinoa1984,As good of a Chris Farley movie you will ever see him in,7,4 February 2001,"(Possible Spoilers)Tommy Boy is a classic comedy, and despite some flaws (one being that a tragic turn is made in the film when they could've made a different plot change), this is something good to watch.  Chris Farley turns in a performance as Tommy that is only matched by his Matt Foley on Saturday Night Live as a klutz who suddenly has to save his father's factory when he can't (catch my drift on the tragic), so he brings along reluctant and sarcastic Richard, played by David Spade in one of his best roles.  On they're odyssey to save they're factory, we see the utterly ridiculous and utterly hilarious antics that made them famous on Saturday Night Live.  Favorite scene (among many) is the scene with the popped hood. One of the better films of 1995.  Dan Aykroyd appears as Zalinsky. A",Tommy Boy
6,BandSAboutMovies,Fun,5,13 June 2020,"We've talked about Peter Segal before - he directed Get Smart - and here he's unleashing Chris Farley on the big screen as the son of ""Big Tom"" Callahan (Brian Dennehy), who soon drops dead after marrying Bo Derek. We should all be so lucky. Soon, he's trying to save the company along with his father's best employee, Richard Hayden (David Spade).This movie is basically a road film packed with hijinks. Rob Lowe played the part of Tommy's stepbrother uncredited as he was contractually obligated to make Stephen King's The Stand. However, he took the part as a favor for Farley. Much like every movie this week, Dan Aykroyd shows up. Here, he's car store dealer Ray Zalinsky.Will you enjoy this film? It just depends on how you feel about Farley. Me, I loved him, so I've seen this so many times. It holds up and has plenty of emotion to go with all the laughs.",Tommy Boy

8,Calicodreamin,Fat man in a little coat,7,14 October 2021,"Some seriously cheesy comedic moments from Spade and Farley, but they work so well together you can't help but laugh. The storyline is surprisingly well thought out and the acting isn't too bad.",Tommy Boy
9,anaconda-40658,Overrated Crap!,2,29 May 2015,"Tommy Boy (1995): Dir: Peter Segal / Cast: Chris Farley, David Spade, Bo Derek, Brian Dennehy, Rob Lowe: Pathetic juvenile comedy starring Chris Farley as Tommy boy and he has just arrived home from college celebrating an array of straight D minuses. That pretty much sums up the effort that went into this film. Brian Dennehy plays his proud father who hires him on as part of his business, which specializes in brake shields. He introduces Tommy to his fiancé and son, which thrills him to the point of inviting his new brother out cow tipping. On the wedding day his father has a heart attack and business is in trouble until Farley and right hand man David Spade on a road trip to save it. They are unaware that the new fiancé is really out to sell the company. Dreary plot reduced to road movie formula. Director Peter Segal shows potential here but with The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult he had a better script and broader laughs. Farley and Spade go through one embarrassing situation after another unable to avoid mugging or overplaying. Bo Derek and Rob Lowe should have known better. It might have helped if Derek's seductress met with consequences. Certainly Lowe is met with greater consequence than just a bad career move. Purposed to capitalize on Farley's success on Saturday Night Live but it should be tossed into a busy interstate. Score: 2 / 10",Tommy Boy
10,FlashCallahan,Comb your hair......,6,9 June 2012,"Tommy is a slow-witted, clumsy guy who recently graduated college after attending for seven years.His father, Big Tom Callahan, owns an auto parts factory.When Tommy arrives home, he finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to his soon-to-be stepmother, Beverly, and her son Paul.But when Big Tom dies, the factory threatens to go under unless new brake pads are sold.Tommy must go on the road to sell them, along with the assistance of Richard, Big Tom's right-hand man.....Here in England, this was the only Farley film that made it to the big screen, partly because at the time this sort of humour was deemed to immature for wide release.Now cinemas are rife with this stuff, thanks to the dumbing down of civilisation. It's throwaway stuff, and while the film lasts, it's okay.It would have been good to see if Farley would have become something, because his films were on a par with Sandlers at the time.Narrative is straight forward, and the whole point of the film is Farley falling over, being silly, and having crazy hair, while David Spade stands there and rolls his eyes.It's all predictable stuff, there is a point in the film, like every film like this, where they think all is lost, and then they redeem themselves.Forgettable, but slightly endearing.",Tommy Boy
11,Sylviastel,A great cast and somewhat average movie!,9,31 July 2005,"I don't care much classic films. They are too set on becoming classics. Films like Tommy Boy is not a rarity. It's not brilliant but it is memorable for its cast starring the late Chris Farley, David Spade, Brian Dennehy, Rob Lowe, Bo Derek, Julie Warner, Colin Fox, and Dan Ackroyd. I remember watching ""Just Shoot Me"" with Brian Dennehy playing David Spade's dad. I am grateful to see Bo Derek working since she openly admitted that she is a Republican. You would think that they would prefer her to be a lesbian. Regardless of our political differences, Bo is still a perfect 10 who takes care of herself and looks better than most women half her age even my age which is in my early thirties. I love Julie Warner and Chris Farley together. I enjoy the scenes between David Spade and Chris Farley which make the film irresistible to the viewer. I liked Canadian actor Colin Fox in his minor. I will watch him in anything. Dan Ackroyd has a small but pivotal role as the man who wants to take Brian Dennehy's character Tom Callahan's company which supplies 300 jobs to the people of Sandusky, Ohio. I know it's probably not based on an actual story. But this film is what America is all about, the American worker is the average man. We could all use employers like Tom Callahan who treated his employees more like relatives than just his employees. I won't say much more about the plot but I like this film. I will watch it again if there is nothing else on. Rest in peace, Chris Farley, you left us too soon.",Tommy Boy
12,namashi_1,Chris Farley rules!,10,2 March 2010,"Peter Segal's 1995 commercial hit & now cult-classic 'Tommy Boy' is a hilarious film, an evergreen entertainer. Chris Farley is a talent which we'll never ever forget!!! 'Tommy Boy' is a simple story, told in the funniest & zany way possible. Farley & Spade take a journey which is filled with unstoppable laughter, even the Rob Lowe portion is damn funny. As a kid, I remember watching 'Tommy Boy' again and again and again. It's been of my childhood favorites, and it will always remain to be. Even today when it comes on T.V. I stick to it as a die-hard fan. I am quite possessive about this film. Segal's direction is super. Chris Farley might have died in 1997, but remains alive for me, at least. What an actor! Watch his work in 'Tommy Boy', he's so much at ease. He delivered fantastic performances later on in films like 'Berverly Hills Ninja' & 'Almost Heroes', but his work in here remains as his best to date! Love you, Farley! Spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. He's an excellent actor in all respects! 'Tommy Boy' rules.... 100 thumbs up from this writer!",Tommy Boy
13,StevePulaski,"A film that knows its audience, its goal, and its standards",8,19 December 2011,"The humor in Tommy Boy is nothing of high quality, and people shouldn't look at it as ""the funniest film ever made."" It's a mindless, joyous, rowdy ride through non-offensive material with two lead actors giving their all and forming simple and sincere chemistry. Now how can you hate a movie like that? The hate that this film has gotten is undeserving, really. It's nothing more than comedic fluff. Slapstick is a hard thing to achieve, and usually dumb laughs are the only thing a movie in this genre does achieve. Tommy Boy achieves great chemistry between two actors, good laughs, and sincere characters all in its short runtime. To begin with, when dealing with slapstick you need a likable, unoffensive star who is capable of being sweet and goofy. Farley just works. And he shows it explicitly here.Plot-wise, the film focuses on goofball Tommy Callahan III (Farley) who has just graduated College and is on to take over his father's company, Callahan Autos. His father (Dennehy) is about to get married again, but collapses and dies while dancing on his big night. Callahan Autos is trying to sell half a million brake pads, and now their time is shortened even more seeing as the death of their boss has left them very vulnerable.Tommy teams up with Richard (Spade), a goody two-shoes employee of his fathers who is jealous of Tommy's nice treatment and ability to be lackadaisical and be rewarded for it, to try and sell as many break pads to different companies across the US so they can make one last attempt to save the company.As you can imagine, the trip is where the duo are going to encounter the most antics. Some are funny, some are tone-deaf and go on for way too long. Tommy Boy does rip off some more successful films like the pool scene from National Lampoon's Vacation, but after a while, it begins to fade into the background and it's something that isn't obtrusive before long.This is a different kind of buddy comedy, because the buddies aren't really buddies, but rather, acquaintances. They're not two best friends hanging out, having fun on a road trip. One's antics leave the other one in a state of overwhelming disgust. Richard becomes Tommy's critic, smart-Alec self-conscious, and verbal abuser. In fact, Spade gets the most laughs out of everyone in the film. Farley is usually the but of every joke, as you'd expect. So maybe Farley isn't a good actor as much as he is a good punchline? Director Peter Segal also worked the camera when it was time to shoot Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, so it's possible that a year later he'd like to spoof the buddy comedy genre by ultimately incorporating two characters who just simply tolerate each other for much of the film. Of course that is as far-fetched of an explanation I think I ever went for. Tommy Boy is funny and that's all there is to it. It's charming, creative, and works on the level it wants to.Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Bo Derek, Julie Warner, Dan Aykroyd, Brian Dennehy, and Rob Lowe (uncredited). Directed by: Peter Segal.",Tommy Boy
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,"It has moments that are funny, but sometimes a little too stupid",6,31 December 2004,"""Tommy Boy"" is a pretty decent comedy that can make almost every person laugh at least once. I have to admit that even I laughed a few times. But it seemed at some moments it got to be a little too silly at times. Chris Farley and David Spade are a great comedy duo, I will never deny that. The supporting cast adds a lot to the movie as well. But the main problem I had was that sometimes it seemed to get a little off hand. Also, they showed all the funny parts in the trailer. Unfortunately, that happens a lot, especially now. It ruins the film and you know what to expect.I would say to give the movie a shot though. I was kind of in a bad mood while watching it, so maybe I should give it another shot. Otherwise, until then...6/10",Tommy Boy
15,MovieAddict2016,Simply not very funny at all and rips off loads of other movies,4,31 August 2005,"Most Lorne Michaels films seem to fail because they're essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. ""Tommy Boy"" is a character right from ""SNL"" - a big fat lovable (in their opinion) goof who doesn't know anything.David Spade gets the Thankless Overwhelmed Everyman role. He's paired with the Annoying Overweight Slob and they endure Miserable Misfortunes as they travel cross country to Save Daddy's Business.The plot, for starters, is really faulty. The whole premise - daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz - can be traced back to just about any movie you want. Like any SNL style film it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, shallow; just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be ""funny"" together.The movie's biggest ""influence"" is the 1987 comedy classic ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles."" That movie is great because the plot isn't stale and recycled. It's basic, yeah - a guy traveling home for Thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob. But it's real, dammit. It makes all the difference. The characters are real, the situations are far more real. ""Tommy Boy"" is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we feel nothing for them, and we don't care about what's happening on-screen. ""PTA"" walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate-able - ""Tommy Boy"" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead, then awakens and wrecks their car.The whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from ""PTA"" and it's eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the Steve Martin/John Candy movie.Farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable - I've never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn't changed my mind. Spade's given very little to do, serving as the movie's most thankless character.Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the Evil Baddie who plans to destroy Daddy's Business. The ending is a joke, and not in a ""har-har funny"" way. More like a ""oh god are they serious?!"" way.Some people dig it, that's cool. But I just can't get into it, nor do I appreciate all the stuff it ""borrows"" from - not just counting ""PT&A"" - without any credit whatsoever.",Tommy Boy

18,Irishchatter,"You have to laugh at this film, it's bloody classic man!",8,12 June 2015,"I loved how Chris Farley (rip) played a clumsy fool to fall in love with. He even sang well with his on-screen father Brian Dennehy. Man, they should've had a band back then cause they pretty darn good singers! David Spade was also awesome in this. He's like this guy who pretends to be the serious guy at the beginning. However as you get use to him throughout the film, you would definitely think he's a natural comedian. He's never straight the way he talks. When he was drunk, it was hilarious that it peed my pants. Bravo Richard!I was so thrilled that they added in Dan Akroyd into this film. He has a perfect salesman voice. I wish he did ads like the ones he does on this. It would be better seeing him on TV adverts then seeing the same stupid ones nowadays. Plus he would be more famous then being an underrated actor.If you think this film wasn't funny, it wouldn't be normal....",Tommy Boy
19,inkblot11,"Need to ""get happy""? Watch this funny film tonight!",7,9 August 2008,"Tommy Boy (Chris Farley) has finally graduated from college after 7 years, even though he still thinks Herbie Hancock signed the Declaration of Independence, not John. He heads home to Sandusky, Ohio, where his father, Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) has operated a successful auto parts business for years. Tommy is to join the firm and he is thrilled to get his own office. Big Tom has other news as well. He is getting married to the luscious Beverly (Bo Derek) and Tommy Boy will have a new stepbrother, Paul (Rob Lowe). However, at the wedding reception, Big Tom keels over from a heart attack. This leaves Tommy in charge of the business and Beverly with half of the company's stock. She is receptive to the overtures from a businessman, Zalinski (Dan Ackroyd) who wants to buy the Sandusky plant for the reputable name only. He plans to shut the place down in reality. This leaves Tommy Boy and his father's right hand man, Richard (David Spade) to go on the road and convince folks to buy their auto parts, putting the firm in a better financial position and avoiding a takeover. But, since Tommy Boy is a half-wit and a business novice, can he really be the savior of the company? This is a funny film, guaranteed to put the viewer in a good mood. The cast is great, with Farley a comic genius and Spade not far behind. Lowe, too, is a stitch as the conniving brother, while Dennehy, Ackroyd, the beautiful Derek, and Julie Warner support the principals nicely. The sets and costumes are fine and the script and direction are snappy and fun, albeit of the more ""lowbrow"" variety. If you want to wash away your troubles and ""get happy"" for a spell, this film is the one for you. Boy, will you laugh it up!",Tommy Boy
20,ironhorse_iv,Oh boy! Oh Boy! Tommy Boy is one funny movie! Holy shnikies! It was fun to watch!,7,21 May 2016,"No doubt about it, Tommy Boy is probably the best film that Chris Farley starred in. Directed by Peter Segal, & written by Bonnie and Terry Turner, produced by Lorne Michaels, and also starring former Saturday Night Live alumni, David Spade & Dan Aykroyd. The film tells the story of a the Man Child, Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) whom must learn to grow up, fast, with some help from his co-worker, Richard Hayden (David Spade), so that he can be able to run his father, Tom Callahan Sr. (Brian Dennehy)'s auto-part-factory, before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the critics at the time, including Roger Ebert got it, all wrong. This road trip/ business movie wasn't horrible as the other 1990s SNL's cast-mates movies, not named Adam Sandler or Mike Myers. Yes, there is a lot of stereotypical fat man slapstick, mixed with low brow toilet humor, and some mean-spirited jokes, but most of the humor were indeed very funny. I laugh at every joke. Even if, some of the jokes seem to be ""influence"" or copy from the 1987 comedy classic ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles."" I think, the critics might had their heads up their butts, that day. It honestly, had a lot of depth, heart and emotional drama. You really do feel for the characters. Chris Farley as Tommy wasn't as annoying as it could had been. After all, the lazy fat man comedy gimmick can only go so far, before it get tiresome, but somewhat Chris Farley was able to pull it off. His character was somewhat a lovable dumb teddy bear. You see the character development, that Tommy goes, through to be a better person. Not only that, but you notice the fun chemistry between Chris Farley and his pal, David Spade, to the point, that they become somewhat known as a comedy duo. David Spade, really works best, as the straight man to Farley's odd behavior. Yes, his character was kinda a jerk-ass, but Richard evolves into somewhat of a Jerk with a heart of gold. So, it was fun to have him, along for the ride. The two find themselves in one ridiculous predicament after another, including my favorite moments, fat man in a little coat and them singing in the car. I really hope for more from there at the time, sadly, it was cut short, with Farley's passing. While, the two actors might fight at times. It's clear by Spade, that he kinda miss the guy. He will indeed, be missed, Spade from all of his fans. Anyways, I glad, this movie got success commercially and was Chris Farley's Breakout Role. It really deserves it. It was very well-acted. Even the supporting cast was memorable. Brian Dennehy look and act like he was having a blast. It's so unlike, the normal films, I see him, in. I love the sing and dance number, he had with Chris Farley in the wedding scene. Made me, very emotional to see him, go. Even Dan Aykroyd was somewhat funny in this film as slick salesman, Ray Zalinsky and he hasn't been humorous in years. Rob Lowe as the villain, Paul was also fun to watch. He really does have a comedy side, that I wish, he would use, more often. The only character, I kinda didn't like, is Bo Derek as Tommy Sr.'s wife, Beverly Barrish-Burns. She does nothing, but act like eye candy, nor does her character get any retribution, toward the end. It's pretty much, look like, she will get away scot-free, because of Ray. Anyways, besides that, this simple minded, laugh out loud comedy really has little flaws to me. Yes, the movie is full of plot clichés, but all of them, kinda work for this type of a film. Yes, it can be somewhat predictable, but I kinda like it, that way. This film, never goes too way, out of the meant of being too unrealistic, unless you count the attempted terrorist act, toward the end; then yeah, it might be a little too far-fetch. However, the pacing for this film made it flow fast and you hardly have time to question, such things. Even the music by composter, David Newman was amazing to listen to. I just wish they didn't used, too much of composter, James Newton Howard's score and George Fenton's score to 1993's 'Groundhog Day', way too much in this film. Despite that, it's really hard to hate this film. This film really stands the test of time. Its scenes, lines, and moments are very memorable. Overall: This good belly laugh of a movie is a blast to watch. Go see it, if you haven't.",Tommy Boy
21,jacobjohntaylor1,It is really not funny,1,2 May 2018,This is not a funny movie. It is very overrated. I think people will like a comedy movie because it is a comedy movie.

24,matthewssilverhammer,Among the best SNL alum films ever,8,26 May 2020,"Farley was certainly one of the most effortlessly funny people ever, but he was also just a decent actor. He sells every bit of naïve sweetness he's asked to, & even manages some real emotions. His partnership with Spade was crazy; their comedic styles are so vastly different, it's incredible they work together so well. Spade's biting, cynical sarcasm is made all the better by Farley's guileless reactions. Nearly every scene (other than some of the bigger moments in the end) is a mini-segment of LOL brilliance.",Tommy Boy
25,videorama-759-859391,Farley....oh boy!,6,11 January 2021,"Another harmless and sometimes gross Adam Sandlerish comedies, with morals and an interesting chemistry between Spade and Farley, and some nasty from Rob Lowe, again, as character of lowness. He does it well here. Farley's Dad (the great late Dennehy) dies, leaving Farley to take over his Dad's running of a big tire brake, corporation. Just wedded to him, his young fox girlfriend, money grabber Derek, provides some tastiness and cleavage. Slipping out of the pool, as a payout to the movie 10, had me first initially thinking, is she that bad an actress. Julie Warner is real pretty scenery as a desk clerk, at Farley's business, and falls romantically for him. To save the business from ruin, Spade, who I always love to watch, and Farley hit the road, to make many many sales, while using Daddy's collateral to hold off a bigger buyer, who wants to shut the tire auto plant. Tommy Boy does have many funny moments, but it can't the mold of being another stupid comedy. Dan Ackroyd again, gives his all to his performance, in mostly what is a cameo, if important role, again, funny and entertaining. But it's Farley's show. His enthusiasm and engaging personality, performance, which of course, is over the top, a lot, which at times, is annoying, of course, reminds us we lost another star, way too soon.",Tommy Boy

Forget that director Peter Segal is behind it and writers Bonnie and Terry Turner (I was about to write Bonnie and Clyde, but how dare me) supply an abundance of immature humor that Farley & Spade fans will surely love for years to come.

When insulted by Spade's numbers-cruncher Richard, Tommy says, ""Lots of people go to college for seven years,"" to which Richard cynically replies, ""Yeah. They're called doctors. Oh, that must be you."" Tommy's no doctor and in fact, I don't think it's ever stated what he majored in but you can infer it was most likely business but this is dubious (on his history final - his key to graduating - he answered ""Herbie Hancock"" on a question about this nation's founding fathers) since once he returns to his home town of Sandusky, Ohio, he takes a job at his dad's auto parts plant.His dad, Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), runs Callahan Auto Parts, which has been in business for over 70 years and he looks to leave everything to Tommy. Upon his return home, Big Tom announces his plans to marry Beverly (""10"" Bo Derek) and her son Paul (Rob Lowe) is on his way in time for the wedding. But when Big Tom drops dead on the big day, the company, which is already on shaky grounds with the bank because of Big Tom's investment in launching a revolutionary line of brake pads, Tommy Boy steps up, with a reluctant Richard in tow, to try and save the company.From there on, plot goes out the window and for the rest of the film it's the Farley & Spade Show - on the road - as they try to save Callahan and prevent stiff-haired auto parts mogul Ray Zalinsky (Dan Aykroyd) from buying it up in a corporate takeover. (""Road Rules"" never had anything on these two guys.) They crack insults, fail miserably at sales meetings (Tommy even lights a prospective buyer's model cars on fire), run over a deer (which miraculously springs to life in the back seat of Richard's car, completely destroying it in the process), and the two eventually learn to put aside intellectual differences and focus on saving their jobs at Callahan.The problem is, Tommy lacks the book smarts required for the job of salesman and little-guy Richard is hardly able to do better himself, but once big-guy Tommy Boy has some ""chicken wings"" (don't ask; just watch), they start making the sales and come up with the loot needed to repay the loan to the bank, Tommy will get high school friend Michelle (Julie Warner), and then call it a day.Idiotic plotting in the film's script doesn't even fit in here, since you're having a ball (or splitting a side) watching the dynamic interaction between leads Farley and Spade. It's been a long time since I've seen a funnier on-screen duo that works so amazingly well. The big story is of course, the late Chris Farley, enjoying one of his last and most memorable roles as the college-graduate-idiot who learns to grow up and take some responsibility after his dad's passing.I guess, in the end, every Tommy Boy has his day.7/10",Tommy Boy
27,drqshadow-reviews,"A Simple, but Effective, Ride Down the Highway with One of SNL's Largest Personalities",8,18 December 2020,"Saturday Night Live was such a fertile breeding ground for this type of pop-friendly, quotable, digestible comedy in the mid 1990s. The very best amongst these could even give the old heartstrings a tug; no mean feat for a sub-genre that usually leaps from loud noises to broken furniture and back again.Tommy Boy is one such marvel. There's nothing overtly groundbreaking or creative about the script - the boss's doofus kid inherits a family business, embarks upon a road trip, develops a close friendship and (eventually) finds his way - but, through Chris Farley's irresistible strength of personality, its value far outweighs the sum of its parts. Which, again, is a common trait among this era's SNL graduating class. Adam Sandler's breakthrough films walk the right side of idiocy due to the star's unique force of will. Wayne's World would be weak sauce, at best, without Mike Myers and Dana Carvey's side-splitting delivery.This adventure is entirely a Farley playground, with just a few spicy, sarcastic segments set aside for his second-billed counterpart, David Spade. The two do have chemistry, which makes for good feelings when they finally work past their differences and unite against the common enemy, but Spade's acidic stylings are smartly limited to occasional counterpunches (or, sometimes, a well-swung 2x4). Farley just has so much energy, I'm not sure there'd be room for a partner of more equal footing. He dominates with jolly physicality, reels us in with heart-on-sleeve self-deprecation, even stings us with a few touches of tender sensitivity. By the end of the road trip, we've been through hell together and watched him grow up.Tommy and company might not brave new horizons, but they still hold a special place in my heart. All the memorable bits still bring big laughs, an endless string of fondly-remembered phrases for those of us who lived through the film's first years, but it also handles enough emotional resonance to keep everything tethered to the turf. A fine night's entertainment.",Tommy Boy
28,TOMNEL,Just not very funny.,5,24 April 2008,"""Tommy Boy"" seems to have become somewhat of a cult comedy, and also the movie that supposedly shows what Chris Farley's all about. I just didn't find Farley funny. He used the same type of humor over and over again, the same humor he used over and over again on Saturday Night Live. He yells a lot and is very over the top stupid, but it just doesn't come off as funny, it comes off as annoying. However, even though he's not funny, he had something going for him here. He plays a very dumb character, and plays it like a stupid kid with good intentions. So he comes off as a little kid, which makes the character somewhat likable.Tommy (Chris Farley) has just graduated college after six years, and is now working for him millionaire father, Tom (Brian Dennehy). Tom is the owner of a very successful auto parts company, and he's also going to be married. After dying at the wedding, Tommy decides to take over his father's business and go with his father's assistant, Richard (David Spade) on the road to sell the parts. Meanwhile, Tommy's father's widow and her ""son"" (Rob Lowe) are planning a way to get the money from the company. It's got a lot of twists and turns in the plot actually, which isn't a bad thing.David Spade plays the smart alec brat, the same character he plays in every movie he's in, and Chris Farley plays the loud idiot. These two actors, also seen together in Black Sheep, do not play off each other well, and both just come off as annoying for the most part. The movie looks great. The camera-work is really nice, and the musical score helps it out to make it seem like more than just another cheap Saturday Night Live skit. Unfortunately, the comedic abilities of the two lead actors just couldn't pull this film off.My rating: ** out of ****. 97 mins. PG-13.",Tommy Boy

After Tommy Boy became a huge hit, the duo returned again to make another film and with hopes of many more. The SNL (Not Ready for Prime Time Performers)of Farley and Spade were real life friends. The on screen chemistry the two had is part of why Tommy Boy did so well. An interesting coming of age drama / comedy, Tommy Boy is about Tommy, a young man who has not, yet, grown up. After the sudden death of his father, Tommy is faced with the problem of having to save his families business from being sold. Proving to himself and to his small town that he can save the day, Tommy, with help from Richard (played by David Spade) the two beat the odds and save the company from being sold. A great road trip movie, Tommy Boy is a surprise hit for a wide audience. A soon to be classic.",Tommy Boy
30,TheOneThatYouWanted,Really an 8 out of 10 kind of movie but I'm ranking to offset the hate,9,10 July 2016,"I have no idea why Adam Sandler movies rank higher than this. Anyway, if you want to see Chris Farley at his very best then you should check out this little gem. It is literally playing all the time on TNT, USA, FX or SpikeTV. The movie is about a loser who has to step to to save his late father's company from a member of the 1%. Funny how this film is dated but still relevant today, thanks to corporate greed and general American ignorance about what they really should be caring about. If Americans cared half as much about the economy as they do to social or foreign topics then this world would be a much better place. Anyway, Tommy, played by Chris Farley teams up with his childhood nemesis, played by David Spade and they set off on a hilarious sales trip in order to save their company and town. The film is funny as heck, especially if you're watching it for the first time. Farley and Spade are without a doubt one of the greatest comedy duos of all time. 2 years after this film was released Chris Farley died of a cocaine overdose. What a shame. Anyway, I highly recommend this comedy because it can make you laugh without objectifying women or using lewd sexual content to force a laugh out of you.",Tommy Boy
31,PredragReviews,"""I can get a good look at a T-bone...""",8,8 May 2016,"Chris Farley was a comic genius, he could make you laugh without even trying. And, he and David Spade made a great team, the funniest comic team since Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. The basic story of this movie is that Farley plays Tommy Calahan, a burnout college student whose father (Brian Dennehy) owns a brake pad company. When his father dies, Tommy must take over and try to keep the company afloat with the help of his dad's assistant (Spade), and keep his evil stepmother and her ""son"" (played by Bo Derek and Rob Lowe) from usurping the inheritance. Through this somewhat clichéd storyline, we get tons of laughs, and more than a couple of dramatic moments, proving it's not just some silly little film. If you love to laugh, you can't get go wrong here.The film takes a dive into some of the greatest and most memorable scenarios. From Tommy slamming into doors, burning models, and ruined cars to the memorable lines and bickering between he and fellow co-star, David Spade. The film also has a fine supporting cast, from Dan Ackroyd, Brian Dennehy, and even Rob Lowe as the antagonist. It rises above your normal comedy to be something else because the script is well thought out for the most part and it allows these guys just to really show us into their lives, while presenting a heartwarming story about saving an auto-plant. Sure, not everything is the greatest ever but this story has too many good things going for it not to like it.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Tommy Boy
32,brchthethird,Dumb but watchable,5,14 November 2014,"A fun (but only occasionally funny), dumb comedy. The plot is rather simple and unspectacular and the acting is serviceable. Chris Farley is really the only reason to see this movie, due to various comedic episodes peppered throughout the run time. He's able to elevate the material somewhat on his charm and charisma, even bringing a little heart/pathos to the role. You can't really say that for the rest of the movie, though, because it's filled with clichés, plot holes, lapses in logic and implausibilities. Still, the strong central performance by Farley, who proves himself quite adept at physical comedy, is reason enough to see it at least once.",Tommy Boy
33,mattymatt4ever,"Chris Farley was an unbelievable talent, but this comedy is too lame for its own good.",5,14 June 2001,"Chris Farley was a uniquely talented comic with relentless energy, and he almost always made me laugh.  Of course, his funniest appearances were on SNL with such legendary characters as Matt Foley.  He was quite funny in this movie, sometimes hilarious, but the script was extremely lame and forced the characters to go through such ludicrous, predictable situations. Farley did his best to salvage the weakly written gags and succeeds at times, but not enough.  If there was a scene that required a cheap pratfall, he tried to make it funny by screaming out loud and overacting.  Usually, that method of comedy worked for him--and often cracked me up--but with material like this, he just made a fool of himself.  Luckily, Farley was the kind of guy who never overacted to the point where it was annoying--Well, at least that's how I feel.  He was another one of those comic actors--a little like Adam Sandler--who had an oddly appealing comic charm and made me laugh for no real particular reason.  David Spade, however, gave the most annoying performance of his career.  He can be funny.  In a lot of instances, he is.  But playing a sarcastic, stuck-up yuppie is not his forte.  He just spouted out one pretentiously annoying line after another.  The plot is predictable, stupid, implausible and topped off with some cheesy twists.  The gags are often cheap and embarrassing.Farley was about the only saving grace.  He was the only reason I did get some good laughs.  My score:  5 (out of 10)",Tommy Boy
34,Beta_Gallinger,"Some of the gags are a bit too silly, but the film has its moments, enough to make it reasonable",7,12 July 2007,"I first saw this comedy several years ago, when I was around seventeen. From what I remember, I liked it a lot at the time. I'm not sure exactly how many times I've seen it since then, but I watched it again about three months ago, for the first time in a while, and I still enjoyed most of it, but probably not quite as much as before. I just watched the movie once again, and this time, I still laughed, but I was definitely less impressed than I was during any of my previous viewings.Tommy Callahan Jr. is not a very bright individual, but after seven years in college, he just barely manages to pass. After graduating, he returns to Ohio, where his dad, ""Big Tom"" Callahan, owns an auto parts factory. When Tommy Jr. returns, he soon finds that he has a new job at this factory. He also learns that his dad, a widower, is about to marry a woman named Beverly Barish, and apparently, Tommy is about to have a stepbrother named Paul. Sadly, ""Big Tom"" suddenly dies during the wedding, and after this, the factory is looking at going under! In order to save the business, Tommy Jr. must go on a road trip with Richard Hayden, Big Tom's assistant, to try and sell brake pads. Tommy's stupidity will make this mission more challenging, and to make matters worse, he doesn't know that Beverly and Paul are not who they claim to be! ""Tommy Boy"", starring ""Saturday Night Live"" comedians Chris Farely as Tommy Callahan Jr. and David Spade as Richard Hayden, has quite a bit of very funny slapstick (a kind of humour which I usually like a lot), but also has some lame gags and cheesy quotes, which brings it down a bit. It's pretty shaky around the beginning, showing the shortcomings of the film a lot. It eventually improves, becoming funnier and looking more promising, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay that way for the rest of the movie. There are times after that when the movie goes back to those shortcomings, and the gags involving Tommy's clumsiness may wear a bit thin after a while. Fortunately, however, all this doesn't TOTALLY ruin it.Some consider the late Chris Farley a great comedian, while others don't think he was any good at all. (Personally, I don't think he was the greatest comedian of all time, but he could be hilarious. R.I.P.) If you strongly dislike Farley and his antics, ""Tommy Boy"" is not for you, as throughout the film, his presence on the screen would likely just annoy you. However, if you're a fan of Chris Farley, and you don't mind seeing a lot of silliness and filth in a comedy, this movie could be fun. It may not be as good as some of the SNL sketches featuring Chris Farley, but you should probably still give it a chance.",Tommy Boy

Or love it, though I'm not sure I want to go that far....Chris Farley is a comic actor unknown to me, apart from his parts in Waynes World, which I saw so long ago, I cannot remember him. I understand that he was one of a kind and much loved. Comparisons with the Farrelly brothers cannot be dismissed, but Tommy Boy just seems less lame and crude and has more zest and genuine enthusiasm, by all in it. And I'm not sure that the Farrelly's could extend a script about brake pads over 90 minutes, either!It's good to see Dan Ackroyd and Bo Derek, Ackroyd himself being another great comic actor. David Spade I really don't know but he makes a great Laurel to Farley's modern day Hardy. Big on size, heart and character, was Mr Farley.Not one I'll be buying on DVD but did enjoy my seeing it on Sky Movies.",Tommy Boy

39,moviesleuth2,A movie that will always hold a special place in my heart,10,5 December 2009,"I've watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life, and it never gets old. For all the snide remarks and insults (mostly from David Spade), ""Tommy Boy"" has a giant heart. And that's what keeps this movie funny after all these years.Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), master car parts salesman, and has ridden on that all his life. But after his dad dies on his wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt, and about to be bought by Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a huge car parts company. So in order to save the company, Tommy has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads. Along for the ride, though not by choice, is Richard Hayden (David Spade) a former classmate of Tommy's who was Big Tom's right-hand man.The movie rides on the chemistry between the two SNL stars (and real-life best friends) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world. It's the big, dumb guy versus the smart little guy. It works, and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. Farley and Spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well. Although the film is primarily a comedy, it has its fair share of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are just as good there as when they're making the audience laugh.Forgive me, but I have to talk about Chris Farley a little more. I read his biography (""The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts,"" for anyone who cares), and understanding who Chris was in real life made this movie more special to me. Chris Farley was a genuinely good person who struggled, and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions. Although this was the first movie he had a major role in, it is his best film. It really showed who he was, and just how much talent he had. Knowing Chris's story adds another layer to this movie, although it doesn't make it any less funny.Farley and Spade are matched with a good on screen cast. Rob Lowe is suitably slimy as Tommy's ""new brother,"" and Bo Derek is solid as his step-mother. Brian Dennehy is great as Big Tom. Dennehy makes it easy to believe that they're father in son. Big Tom is just as crazy as his son, although he's smarter and more mature. Dan Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy the hard truth behind advertising. Julie Warner is also good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle.For me, Peter Segal is one of the great comedy directors. He keeps the pace quick and energetic, but most importantly, he knows how to make comedy funny. He doesn't belabor the jokes, and he understands that funny actors know what they're doing and he allows them to do it. But Segal goes a step further. He gives ""Tommy Boy"" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings (genuinely) and tickles the funnybone.Critics didn't like ""Tommy Boy."" Shame on them. A movie doesn't have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny (God forbid Farley and Spade were forced to do muted comedy a la ""The Office""). This is a great movie and one of my all-time favorites.",Tommy Boy
40,TalesfromTheCryptfan,One of my favorite comedies!,10,21 May 2006,"Tommy Callihan III ( Chris Farley) has always been like a loser even though his father is a successful car parts company owner, he has recently got his business degree and his father Big Tom Callihan( Brian Dennehy) teaches him how to run a business.

Richard and Tommy begin a road trip in selling the company's product in order to become a major success even though Tommy isn't too bright about anything as long as Richard is there to help him out.Very entertaining and hilarious hit comedy has become a cable comedy favorite and a sort-of cult flick! this has became Chris Farley's big breakthrough film after doing appearances in movies like ""Coneheads"", "" Airheads"" and ""Billy Madison"" and David Spade is hilarious as the weaselly business worker who becomes sometimes either a friend or foe to Farley's character. Thus a likable and funny duo is made on the screen like Lurel and Hardy or Cheech and Chong, one of the more funnier moments in the movie was when after they run after a deer then have it in the back seat of their car it wakes up at night and tears apart almost the car, if you like a good comedy then i highly recommend this movie.P.S.: Look for appearances by Dan Ackroyd as well.",Tommy Boy

This is Farley's best film, in my opinion, and one of the best comedies of 1995.After finally graduating college in his 7th year, Tommy returns home to find a job and office waiting for him at his Dad's (Brian Dennehy) auto supply company. He also returns home to find that his Dad is engaged to be married to a beautiful woman named Beverly (Bo Derek) and that she has a son too, named Paul (Rob Lowe). However, when his Dad dies from an apparent heart attack during his wedding reception, it falls to Tommy and Richard to hit the road and save the company through their sales pitches. Tommy is clumsy, dim-witted and accident prone - but his heart is good and his intentions noble.I honestly couldn't even tell you how many times I've seen this movie, and I still laugh out loud. Few actors had the physical comedy that Chris Farley had and when you pair that up with David Spade's pithy remarks and witty comebacks - it is pure gold. These two were perfect together here - comedic chemistry at its best. Casting Brian Dennehy as his father was inspired, they really look like they could've been father and son. Seeing Bo Derek in a main role again was also a lot of fun.This is a very high recommend. ""Tommy Boy"" is a true comedic classic that is just as enjoyable and laughable today as it was 25 years ago. You can't go wrong with this gem.",Tommy Boy
42,policy134,Farley: No John Belushi but still way better than Jack Black,6,6 January 2007,"This is by far the best Chris Farley movie ever made and not to step on his grave but he was not in the same league as his idol, John Belushi - may they both rest in peace.I didn't have high hopes when I first decided to give it a watch but I actually thought it was quite hilarious in several scenes. My favorite has to be when Farley and David Spade go into a sales pitch and Farley makes his presentation using two toy cars with disastrous results. I won't reveal anymore because it can never be fully appreciated if described. Look for a similar scene, where Farley is ""negotiating"" with a waitress for some fried food.I also think that although David Spade has limited screen appeal, he and Farley actually make a fairly good team. Farley's character, Tommy Callahan, is no master at the snappy comeback and that is made an ongoing theme all through the movie (This is a part of the movie that's not so great). Since it is a Chris Farley, you can bet that you will also see a lot of physical comedy and here it is actually not so mind numbingly stupid as it later became in the Farley/Spade followup ""Black Sheep"". Yes, we know that Farley's character is required to get him into jams that would kill a real person but it is kind of refreshing to see such a scene that pays tribute to old time comedians like Laurel and Hardy and in some ways Chaplin too. You can be sure that your intellect will not be tested when watching Tommy Boy and that's fine.But ultimately the stupid plot kicks in: Farley's administrator or whatever you call her (played by the lovely Julie Warner) likes him but of course there has to be some mix-up to split them apart for a while. In comes Farley's step-brother and nemesis played by Rob Lowe (he must hold some kind of record for appearing in the movies of Saturday Night Live players). He sabotages an important element of the scheme to keep Farley's company running and wouldn't you know it: it all solves itself in the last half hour. See the ridiculous cameo by Dan Aykroyd to find out for yourself.So to sum up: The first 45 minutes are a blast to watch and the last are somewhat bland but the fact is Farley would sink a lot deeper in his last movies and that's that.

45,CinematicInceptions,"Nothing special, but worth a shot",7,28 January 2015,"This isn't a comedy that's going to top any lists. There is nothing superlative about it in any regard. That said, it is by no means poorly done or unenjoyable. In some ways it's designed in a Lowest Common Denominator style (or one size fits all if that makes more sense), but essentially it hovers a little bit above mediocrity. You have good actors that have a fairly good script to work with and the product comes out as a general crowd pleaser. The comedy, though undeniably slapstick throughout, has some variety to it. This is mostly because the majority of the gags and screen time in general are split between David Spade and Chris Farley. Even in the situations where both of their characters are involved, we get different styles of comedy. The humor definitely deserves it's PG-13 certification, but there's plenty of clean humor mixed in as well. There's a fair amount of recurring gags with Tommy (Chris Farley) being klutzy and overweight, but there is also enough verbal comedy to entertain those who don't enjoy the former style, again showing that this movie was likely made with an LCD mentality. Also, there are a fair amount of laughs that come from small, nameless characters that Tommy and Richard (David Spade) meet along the way.The story, like most of the movie, is satisfactory, but unremarkable for the most part. From what I've heard, the business comedy idea is not a new one, so the storyline doesn't score any points for originality. Still, it progresses naturally and isn't hard to follow, though there are a couple of twists along the way. There are no hidden morals or deep concepts like in John Hughes movies. It ends in a sort of happily ever after, but this is presented in a sort of mocking way. The villains are, again, satisfactory, though unremarkable and get relatively little screen time. Besides, it's a comedy so most viewers probably care more about the journey rather than the outcome.The execution is alright, though it doesn't need much attention considering that it's a comedy. The acting is pretty good, and, as stated before, they are given a pretty good script and characters.If you like road trip comedies like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, or The Great Outdoors, this is worth a shot. I wouldn't recommend going out to spend money on it, but if you can't find anything else worth watching, give it twenty minutes and enjoy if you can. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.",Tommy Boy

Now, Chris Farley may bring too much energy, and turn into a maniac, but it's just way too funny, and the dynamic duo of Farley and Spade end up creating a hilarious chemistry between the two buddies, after working with each other on ""Saturday Night Live"". SNL creator Lorne Michaels has helped make the movie become an SNL sketch, or a long SNL sketch. So the movie was funny in every way, and the well-written wacky script felt so comedic and way deserving. From running over a dead deer, dancing in the gas station with cow crap all over, to Dan Aykroyd's incredible cameo role, ""Tommy Boy"" is a well-deserving laugh, and it's fun to never forget it. ""Tommy Boy"", in my review, ""a well-deserved comedy from the minds of SNL"".",Tommy Boy
49,Mcduff3601,A timeless classic that is as funny as the first time I watched it,9,5 March 2018,This is one of those rare comedies that I can rewatch every few years. I find it so endearing and entertaining. I can trust this movie to give me some laughs and perk me up. I tend to watch a heavy movie then follow up with something a little lighter and this one does the trick every time.I have a really hard time rewatching comedies as a lot of the fun and laughter comes from the first time hearing the joke or seeing the schtick. I don't know if this movie would hold up well for someone in today's age that had never seen it before but for me it is in my vault of rewatchable movies.,Tommy Boy
50,tnrcooper,Hilarious hilarious film. Chris Farley is missed,8,12 August 2005,"Well, on the day that Rob Schneider plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely not-at-all-wanted ""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo"" (hmmmm....wasn't there a film called Roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now there's Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo followed by sequel Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo.......I smell a pattern. Perhaps soon there will be Spiderman: European webs are Hotter.....or not) I am writing about this much maligned (at time of release) film. I was one of those maligners, I must admit. I turned my nose up at it even while Chris Farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the SNL cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in '94-'95, the Norm McDonald anchorship notwithstanding. Films like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy, and Black Sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler films. However I watched this film the other day, ten years after and 8 years after Chris died and could not stop laughing. Yes it's not particularly sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny being Manny) but his ""Van Down By the River"" motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not ""wash enough"" or ""wear well-fitting clothes"" or ""use deodorant more than twice a week"" translates well here as the ever self-effacing character who realizes he's not the brightest, not the best-looking, and could stand to lose a few pounds. All the same, he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to. And David Spade just tosses off his snide one-liners as he did for ""Spade's Hollywood Minute"" and basically stings Farley's self-esteem. There's really not a whole lot more to say than that. I love the one scene when Farley catches Spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it. Can't remember what the first one is but the second one, they're lying in their hotel beds and Farley says to Spade, ""Do you like baseball?"". Spade mutters something inaudible in response and Farleys says, ""the New York YANK-ees?"" Anyway Farley does his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat-boy shtick. If you like, you like it. I couldn't stop laughing.",Tommy Boy
51,fjhuerta-2,"One of the best ""dumb"" comedies I've ever seen.",7,17 March 2003,"Dumb comedies... you know you love them. ""Dumb and Dumber"", for example. You might say it's a stupid movie, but guess what? You laugh at it. It might not require intellectual interpretations of the source material (ala Marx Brothers, with their countless broken logic jokes), but it gets the job done.Tommy Boy, in this regard, has to be one of the best ""dumb"" comedies ever. Better yet, it's not that dumb.The basic premise of the movie is, a man in search of his own identity via a series of comedic mishaps. The real premise of the movie is laughter. It's all about Chris Farley and David Spade's over the top performances. Think the destruction of famous hotels in Las Vegas. Everything is all quiet, then there's a sudden build-up leading to a blow-up of gigantic proportions. That's Chris Farley throughout the film. *minor spoilers ahead* I like this movie a lot for what it is and what it portrays - the main character (Tommy) is not a reckless man - he's a sweet, loving person who suddenly discovers he's a grown up who has to act like one, and as such, he lovingly follows his father's footsteps. The side story finds David Spade realizing he has wasted his life as an ironic, sarcastic man and finds comfort in the friendship of the guy he hated the most at school. It's strange to find at least a bit of meaning in what really is a very good comedy.I like it. I really do.",Tommy Boy
52,robawalker-77417,Comedy classic,6,15 October 2021,This is an absolutely funny and original comedy classic. Chris Farley is a riot and David Spade complements him well. Definitely a movie that can be rewatched over and over.,Tommy Boy
53,MinistryofDoom,Non-Stop Hilarity from the Chris Farley/David Spade Comedy Duo,7,7 July 2020,"During the Covid-19 lockdown, I've been rewatching many films that I hadn't seen in years, mainly with my kids whom are now seeing them for the first time. First up was Tommy Boy (1995) starring Chris Farley, David Spade, and Brian Dennehy. It's been 25 years since I saw this film, on opening night at the local cinema no less, but 25 years later it's every bit as hilarious as it was back then. In the 90s, the David Spade & Chris Farley duo was at it's height. Both were riding high from a string of comedic films and SNL features. Tommy Boy was one of many films that saw Chris Farley's self-deprecating ""fat man doing weird stuff"" brand of comedy sandwiched with David Spade's dry sarcastic wit, like Peanut Butter and Jelly. These two together were ALWAYS on fire and Tommy Boy is an example that superbly demonstrates that.Even after 25 years, you will still be howling in laughter at the jokes and slapstick comedy and that really speaks volumes to the sheer comedic talents of both David Spade and the late great Chris Farley. Even Brian Dennehy, who was mostly known for dramatic and action-oriented roles really outdid himself as ""Big Tom"", (father to Farley's ""Tommy Boy""). Both Dennehy and Farley are no longer with us but we will forever have Tommy Boy to look back on.",Tommy Boy
54,richspenc,Holy shnikies,8,26 May 2017,"I always found this movie funny, ever since seeing it for the first time in mid 1990s. I've always liked Chris Farley's trademark yelling, and David Spade's smartassery. Here and in their other comedy ""Black sheep"". There's one sad part and about 50 funny parts. The sad part is Tommy's dad dropping dead at his wedding from a stroke while marrying the sexy Bo Derek. I remember Bo Derek, also sexy in""10"" with Dudly Moore. Tommy's dad's death part lasts about 5 minutes with the bagpipe music playing ""Amazing grace"" (I remember when they copied that part in ""Family guy"" when Stewie's Rupert teddy bear died in one of those cutaway gags ""Family guy"" is known for). After the death part, the laughs get started again. I don't have room to write them all.First the funny bits before Tommy's dad's death. Tommy running past this guy who cowers down all scared so amusingly. Then one of dad's colleagues meeting Tommy and thinking that the first thing to say when meeting someone is ""I had a kidney removed, but I still have the other one"". Then David's smart alec comments to Tommy when getting back from college (Tommy: ""alot of people go to college for at least 7 years"" David sarcastically: ""yeh, they're called doctors"". Then David sees Tommy's bag: ""you spray that thing for bugs?""). I like on the boat with Tommy and sexy Michelle. The ten year olds yelling insults, Tommy yelling insults back and the kids not being slightly phased. Then Michelle yells at them and they suddenly run scared. I agree with Tommy, that..was.. awesome. Then the funny part with Tommy, David, and the executives at the meeting, and Tommy deciding to go on the road selling brake pads. That hardly got the others confident, their reactions included: David: ""I don't think there's anyone who can help Baby Huey out there on the road"". Older women at meeting: ""this is where the whores come in. Whores running around shaking their little be-hinds for the menfolk"". RC: ""we're all screwed! Tommy's one apple that fell way off the tree!"" Only Michelle stayed confident since she liked Tommy. Other funny moments; Tommy and David hitting a dear on the road, and then Tommy yelling at one of his unsuccessful sales appointments, ""we just killed Bambi!"" Tommy sputtering sentence fragments (as David called it) and lighting a company executive's model car on fire. David telling Tommy ""watch and learn"", but then him not doing much better, with the next sales exec.telling him ""I don't like you, you're a smug unhappy little man who treats people like they're idiots"". Tommy getting a repeated comment from different people, ""did you eat a lot of paint chips as a kid?"" He gets that from a sales exec. and from his new stepbrother Rob Lowe, son of dad's wife to be Bo Derek. Zalinski, Dan Akryod, big time auto parts company founder also said the line, just slightly differently, ""did you live under power lines ad a kid?"" Tommy responded to that and the paint chips question the same, ""no...why?"", looking disappointed. Lowe and Bo Derek were revealed to be up to no good and was only marrying Tommy's dad to excrete his money and his business. Tommy's dad died before finding that out but Tommy himself was furious when he found out, ""they lied to my dad!"" Also funny was ""T bone up bull's a** or butcher's word"" remark that Tommy's dad used to persuade a sale successfully, but Tommy wasn't successful when he used if because he couldn't get the words right, well that combined with his dumb unprofessional selling style in general. More funny moments; Tommy and David's ""bees!"" scheme to get out of getting a ticket when getting pulled over. I'm pretty sure that that trick never worked again in real life after this movie came out, since I am sure not too many people by the late 1990s had not seen this movie. Also funny are some of David's snide sarcastic remarks, such as to a gas station attendant while asking directions; attendant to David: ""I am picking up on your sarcasm"" David ""well you should, I'm laying it on pretty thick"". Then the ""chicken wings"" scenario that Tommy and David agree is actually a good sales tactic.""remember, just think chicken wings"". Tommy using the ""chicken wings"" tactic on a customer who was initially uninterested due to there not being a guarantee on the box (I like Tommy's persuasion mentioning how the ""guarantee fairy"" could really just be a crazy glue sniffer who then knocks up their daughter and steals money off the dresser)(I also liked how later during Tommy's televised scene with Zalinski, that same customer sees it on TV, and is disinterested wanting to switch the channel to watch looney tunes). Then there's David's comment about the restaurant not ""deturding"" the shrimp, ""whoa, they caught this one after Thanksgiving feast, we're gonna need a pooper scooper"" (Maybe after deturding that shrimp, they should've put it in a box and marked it that ""guaranteed piece of s***"" that Tommy.was saying to the customer about the guaranteed boxes. Lol). Honestly, after seeing that, I could not eat shrimp again unless I was 100% sure it was devained. I like how they make sure to mark that on bags of shrimp at the store now.",Tommy Boy

It is so stupid at times that it can only be hilarious. Farley is brilliant as the bumbling idiot who takes to the road with his dad's right hand man (the equally excellent Spade) to find the funding to save the families 'auto parts' business.

Don't get me wrong, there are some very funny scenes here.Tommy has just graduated and gets a job at his father's company. He is entitled to sell a product or the company goes belly up. As you can see, Tommy is not the sharpest knife in the drawer. He and co-star David Spade go cross country to sell the product.The chemistry between Spade and Farley is good. They do share some very funny moments together.(The scene at the gas station still has me in stitches) Other times, the movie fails and delivers some juvenile humor. Tommy Boy also suffers from a little boredom too. However, Tommy boy does have enough humor to win me over. Listen to some excellent quotes from David Spade.(What he says during the plane scene are priceless) Although not great, Tommy Boy is an average comedy that delivers just enough humor to succeed.The Last Word: Enjoyable.",Tommy Boy

The cast is great of course, But I just didnt like some of the acting by farley.. it just seemed too over the top and borderline unfunny. Not all but some scenes. Everyone else is pretty forgettable because the director obviously doesnt know what characterization is.Story:
Here's what I disliked the most. The story is just so damn plain. it's just 2 goofballs going through stupid thing after unbelievable stupid thing in a random sequence of scenes. Now for some reason dumb and dumber nailed it with a similar tone, but this misses the mark. Farley and spade have real funny bits here and there. Somethings are trying too hard and is unfunny but some jokes in there genuinely had me dying. I just wished this had a better plot.Summary:

This guy is just too damn funny, and I laugh every time I watch this movie. The relentless energy and physical comedy displayed by a man of his size seems to defy the laws of physics. It's a shame he died so soon, because I don't think it would have been too long before someone cast him in a good movie.Needless to say, anyone who labels this a comedy ""classic"" hasn't watched enough movies, but as a showcase for a gifted comedian who died way too early, it's fantastic.",Tommy Boy

It was THE BEST!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Everything about it is great. Not only do you get a hilarious film but you get a sweet tender story as well. It's about a big dumb but caring guy named Tommy(Farley) who wants to do well, he just doesn't know how. His father knows his son is...well..um...not all there but wants him to join the business away. The Dad makes one of his workers, Richard(Spade), watch over Tommy and keep him in line. This is where the fun begins. The pairing of Chris Farley and David Spade is a comic delight. Like Lucy and Ethel, they get into trouble without even trying. From the rolling M&M's to the deer kill/resurrection, it is all laugh out loud funny.
(**WARNING:SPOILER**)When Tommy's father dies, they need to make alot of money to save the company. So both of them hit the road trying hard to sell the company's auto parts, save the business and the town. During this time Tommy falls for the spunky shipping girl named Michelle and they hit it off. Evil steps in by the name of Bo Derek and bad boy Rob Lowe and hope seems to fade. By the end Tommy has learned how to be a business man, Richard has learned to work well with others, and Michelle has fallen for the big lug.

Tommy (Chris Farley) is given the task of saving the company after his father dies. He sets out with Richard (David Spade) on trip through the mid-west going business-to-business trying to sell enough break pads to save his family's company.REVIEW SUMMARY:
It's Chris Farley! You gotta love him. I'm not usually one for the humor that's dependent on shouting and tripping over a banana peel, but Chris Farley is the one and only exception I have to this. There's something contagious about his never-ending energy. David Spade is so underw- you know what... he's just bad in these movies. LOL (this is the only type of movie I feel comfortable using an analogy in... F it). He's so bad in movies like this and Black Sheep, but the two are so perfectly matched together I can't even make sense of it. At the end of the day, the movie isn't good in any technical sense of the word, but it's fun and has quotable moments. Moments you'll go to youtube to re-watch until the end of time and that's all you can ask from a film like this.

His pacing was great, his innocence and excitement are overwhelming and infectious throughout the film. The dialogue between Farley and Spade is so well delivered, that one can listen to it over and over (""and thank you sir for choosing me"").The scenes that i think capture Farley's genius (and Spade's perfection in delivery) are the sales scenes (especially when Farley sets the man's models on fire.

There's a lot of things similar about this movie and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. Chris Farley and David Spade are the same as Steve Martin and John Candy basically. Steve Martin and David Spade are skinny. John Candy and Chris Farley are both fat. In this, their car gets beat to crap. That's just like what happens in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.

The villain is Rob Lowe, and he's trying to sabotage the business or whatever. Tommy Boy has a lot of funny parts. Chris Farley is funny in a lot of the scenes, but man, sometimes he's just too stupid. Overall, this is a pretty good movie and you should rent it.

73,Hysteria28,Great comedy with awesome dialogues.,7,11 April 2010,"I first watched this movie when it came on network television. I remember recording it. For a mid nineties feature I found it to be very entertaining. Chris Farly was a very hilarious actor. In my opinion Jack Black may have been inspired from him. However comedy movies have come along way since then. Many movies which cater for todays generation tend to rely on heavy comic situations and slapstick to make audiences laugh. With this movie it is not the case. As well as a plot there are funny dialogues mixed with comic acting. David Spade and Chris Farley have been part of many movies. Their pairing is very reminiscent of Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor from the past years. They make a great on screen comedy couple. In this movie their acting ability is progressed to a higher level. They spend more screen time together for most of the movie. This leads to many interesting and hilarious situations arising. This is not your average Farrelly Brothers comedy. It has incorporated some heart warming moments and characters that have feelings. At certain times one will feel that they are watching a made for TV sitcom. However the direction averts our attention away from this thought. The pace of the movie is moderate and with a short running time of 90 minutes, the viewer will not feel that they have wasted their time. I was surprised when I noticed that the movie was almost completely shot in Canada. Why could they not make this obvious to us, I wonder.",Tommy Boy

80,Brian-97,This movie was terrible!,1,8 December 1998,"""Tommy Boy"" is one of the worst films I have ever seen!  The acting is terrible.  The comedy is lame.  The jokes are gross!  Chris Farley was not a good comedian.  All he knew how to do was use disgusting humor along with his size to make raunchy jokes. The only hope for the film is David Spade who provides some comic relief in an otherwise unfunny film.  I don't recommend this film to anyone.  If you're smart, you will stay away from it.I give this film 1/10 and an ""F""!  Two thumbs down!",Tommy Boy
81,TStormJack,Hehehehe,7,25 March 2001,"I'm not a huge fan of David Spade. I think he's funny sometimes but I wouldn't kick myself if I missed an episode of Just Shoot Me. I felt the same about Chris Farley. But the two of them together in this movie (as well as in Black Sheep) were very funny. Farley is very convincing as a dumb guy, and Spade's wit goes well with it. To put it simply, the actors played themselves in the movie. Farley plays a man who has to take over his father's company after his death. And when was the last movie you saw where the main plot of the movie was to sell brake pads? This movie held the now classic Farley ""You're drivin' down the road"" speech, and hearing it never gets old. Neither do the entire car scenes (The singing, the deer and the gas station). The love interest, played by Julie Warner, interested me as well. Wink wink. However, every movie has the part that was a little too much, and this was probably the ""10"" reference to actress Bo Derek.  But the movie had great dialogue, and that's what it comes down to when making a great comedy.",Tommy Boy
82,moviemonster92,"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Tommy Boy""",6,30 July 2006,"Chris Farley has made a career out of playing underachievers and with David Spade at his side they can make funny movies. Here is their first one ""Tommy Boy"". It was a very good movie that has become a favorite teen movie over the generations. The first outing between Farley and Spade (their second being ""Black Sheep"", which wasn't as good as this). The story on this one follows Tommy Callahan the Third, who has just graduated college after 7 years and is going back to his hometown to take control of his father's company (a break pad factory) and gets a surprise: his father Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehey) has met and is engaged to a perfect 10 (Bo Derek) and he is getting a new brother (Rob Lowe). When Big Tom dies of a stroke it's up to Tommy to sell just enough break pads to keep the factory all while his new in laws are conspiring against him. This was a very funny and entertaining movie that should be viewed by everyone who enjoys a good laugh and Chris Farley and David Spade. All and all a very fun and funny movie everyone will like it.3 out of 4 stars",Tommy Boy
83,bfm_1017,"Great fun, Farley and Spade at their best!",7,15 June 2004,"This film unfortunately comes on USA Network way too often. Unfortunate because this film is a very funny movie seen uncut and unedited. Chris Farley was a very funny man, but especially funny paired with straight man David Spade. Brian Dennehy lends a short lived but great character as Tommy's father. The scene where Big Tom cashes in his chips during the wedding reception is classic. Anyone over 50 (like me) who dances at a wedding to Motown can identify with that scene. There are so many funny scenes in this movie, I can't count them! This and Black Sheep are two movies that I can watch with my teenage sons and fall off the chair laughing - the ""Meat Wagon"" scene, the boat in the lake scene, are all side splitters. This film has no ""Oscar"" quality of course, who cares? I want to laugh after a tough week at work, and this movie fits the bill. I put this in the same class as the Rodney Dangerfield movies, but not quite up with Peter Sellers' Pink Panther series. Nonethless, it is a cathartic experience at the end of a week.We can only assume what might have been if Farley had kept his nose clean, it just didn't happen, any more than it did with Belushi. Such a loss in both cases. One thing, don't watch this on TV. Rent it, or buy it. The TV version is so poorly edited for commercials, and the dialogue is edited to make it totally different, and unfunny, kind of like Smokey and the Bandit, not much fun to watch on TV, so buy it or rent it.Where are the next Chris Farley's ? There don't seem to be many funny men these days.",Tommy Boy
84,TorontoLiver,Very good movie!,8,8 November 2009,"This movie is hilarious and clever. The jokes were awesome, the cast is great, especially Tommy (Chris), and the movie in general is great!Tommy Callahan III (aka Tommy Boy) is a man who doesn't do so well in college but finally graduates with a mediocre D+. He was at the college for seven years. He has a friend named Richard (David Spade), who is extremely sarcastic, and a real smart-ass who sometimes goes a little far. Well not necessarily a friend. Sort of rude to Tommy. Tommy is the son of a very wealthy business man, Tommy Callahan II. After Tommy Boy graduates, he has a party with his pals, and gets wasted. After that, he travels back home to Ohio. Then his father gives him a job at his company, Callahan Autos, which specializes in brake-pads. The dad then meets this very pretty woman named Beverly, which he thinks about marrying. Tom and his son meet Beverly's 'son', Paul. Paul is a very nasty, rude, and cynical bastard. He despises Tommy Boy because he's fat and immature. Beverly and Paul aren't exactly good people. They're both con artists! They plan to suck the company dry eventually, especially Paul. Eventually Big Tom falls in love with Beverly and they marry, but things go horribly wrong at the wedding. Tom has a horrible heart attack out of nowhere and dies! After the funeral there is a meeting about the future of the company. At this meeting Tommy agrees to keep the company rolling by selling the most brake-pads possible. And he calls his friend Richard to the stand, who is reluctant to help. ""I don't think anyone could help Baby Huey out there on the road."" he says at the meeting. He does NOT want to help at all. Eventually they're stuck on the road together, and have to help each other. They don't sell so well due to Tommy always irritating the buyers. Tommy and Richard don't necessarily get along out on the road.The movie is funny all the time and hardly takes a break. The acting is wonderful. So if you're looking to watch a GOOD movie, buy Tommy Boy on DVD, and sit down with a friend. You'll be laughing so hard, you might pee your pants! This film is not perfect, but it's still pretty great.",Tommy Boy

86,The_Juggalo5588,The best comedy of the 90's...and probably the best i have seen.,10,11 October 2006,"this movie may not have seemed like much to some people but it had everything i look for in a comedy. fall down funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of seriously moving scenes, great actors, and pretty much everything a good movie is supposed to be like. despite David spade playing his usual snobby character he made this role into an unusual performance which i don't think he had ever exceeded until he hit the screen with Joe dirt. regardless of whether or not some people were not Chris Farley fans i saw this film when it came out and my friends and i still talk about it... 11 years later. this movie was what finally told me that Chris Farley was the real deal. he is the best comedian i have seen in my life. in the words of some he could be clumsy, clever, funny, serious, crazy, sober, and moving or depressing at the same time. not the same words but the message is all that counts. one of the true great actors of our time, and one of the true great comedy's of all time. along with good acting, good story, hilarious moments, serious scenes that at times brought me to tears. this movie stands atop the hordes as a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by the late great Chris Farley. no actor before or since has captured my interests in a movie since. because no actor before or since has put so much into his movies. this movie is worth the time, if you haven't taken the time to see it do so the next time you rent a movie.",Tommy Boy
87,bibleman24,Entertaining!,6,20 September 2011,"This is a funny film - genuinely. It produces a few giggles and one or two howls of laughter.Chris Farley is great, as usual. Totally unique and talented. But he plays a really talentless young man in this film, who screws up everything. Skinny David Spade is the perfect choice as the exact opposite of the over-weight Farley. Things he says, especially some of his side remarks, are really quite amusing.The funniest scene is at the petrol station. I find that just hilarious.If you're looking for a 90 minute piece of half decent entertainment that is really simple to follow, then here is a film for you. It'll be cheap wherever you get it from.",Tommy Boy
88,billrabara,Embarrassing,1,29 July 2020,"Pathetically inept script, weak acting, and sophomoric humor. The movie was released during Farley's heyday at SNL and it's success only attributable to the fervor of his fans. If you are not a Farley fan then after watching this movie you will at best remain not a fan.",Tommy Boy
89,DirectorsCut19,One of the Funniest Films I've Ever Seen!,9,11 August 2005,"During my trip in a youth leadership forum, I was channel surfing until I found ""Tommy Boy"" on TBS. Since I have never seen this film before, I wanted to check it out. My roommate, who have already seen this, told me, ""This movie is a classic."" After seeing the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right.""Tommy Boy"" is constantly funny from beginning to end, thanks to the comedic duo of Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is a riot as the title character, a spastic doofus who just sails through life as if it wasn't important. His slacker-esqe ways soon come to a halt when his father (Brian Dennehy), a wealthy ""Break Pads King"", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. This leads Tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend Richard (David Spade), to hit the road to sell enough break pads to save the company.The main reason ""Tommy Boy"" works are the funny performances from the lead cast. Farley is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person being Spade and the third being Rob Lowe as the film's villain who has bad luck. Another funny guy is Dan Aykroyd as Ray Zalinsky, a well-known auto parts extraordinare.Another reason the movie works is the large amount of jokes. Chris Farley has hilarious slapstick moments, and David Spade has funny snide comments and one-liners. The gags in the movie (some which involves a deer and a airplane bathroom) are laugh-out-loud funny, thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), writers Bonnie & Terry Turner(3rd Rock From the Sun, That 70s Show), and the cast.""Tommy Boy"" is a really funny movie, although for some unknown reason most film critics (including Roger Ebert) find it horrible and unfunny. (I wonder when their sense of humor died.) I recommend ""Tommy Boy"" for those who are great fans of comedy. Thank you very much, roommate.",Tommy Boy
90,gniandra,Pretty Good,10,16 October 1998,"This is one of my most favorite movies of all time. Pretty pathetic you say? Well, yeah it is. But Chris is incredibly,  incredibly funny.

Look at both motel scenes, when Spade gets caught with his zipper down, and the other: ""JUST GO AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!""",Tommy Boy

The movie is also one of my all time favorites. The movie deals with Farley and Spade trying to save the towns auto break factory after Farley's dad's death. There's warmth,heart and pure fun with this film. Highly recommended to all. Nice Scenery to boot and the gags will have you on the floor rolling in laughter. Did I mention excellent acting? Chris Farley shines in a few touching moments as well as hilarious. You'll laugh til you cry. Bo Derek and Rob Lowe make an excellent team as the villains.A must see flick.",Tommy Boy

93,spencer10,Farley was no Belushi or Candy but this is hilarious,8,5 December 2007,"I think every critic who panned ""Tommy Boy"" when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all. Every critic panned Chris Farley and David Spade's movies. Yes ""Coneheads"" was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and ""Black Sheep"" I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made. But ""Tommy Boy"" does not fall in the category of ""Coneheads"" which could have been a little funnier and ""Black Sheep"" which is a piece of tripe. It is very funny and entertaining. I do agree with the critics that Chris Farley was no John Belushi or John Candy as he claimed to have idolized those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no John Belushi, or John Candy but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are side-splitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious. It is very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like ""Tommy Boy"" to remember how truly funny he was. ""Tommy Boy"" is one of the 1990's best comedies.",Tommy Boy

But the elder Callahan's new bride/widow attempts to steal the company from her stepson which forces Spade and Farley to team up, sell the parts needed to save the business, and well, two SNL actors, what do you expect? They make for a brilliant combination, and although many of the scenes were silly at times, I found them funny which made for an enjoyable picture.",Tommy Boy

Sure its no Godfather, On the waterfront, or Casablanca, but I don't think that's what they had in mind, I think they wanted a movie that will turn people into laughing convulsions and that is what it accomplished, for those who didn't like it.

The character of Tommy Callahan is one of Chris Farley's best efforts. It was written for him, and he did it better than anyone else every could have. The movie itself could have just faded into the monotony of other 90's comedies. Tommy and Richard are childhood frenemies, after a major issue at the plant, they have no choice but to get into Richard's cherry 1967 Plymouth Belvedere GTX and drive across the country on the biggest sales run of their lives. Will they do it? Who knows... but Bo Derek is a babe, and maybe the first MILF any 90's kid every truly crushed on.",Tommy Boy

His rotund boyish physical appearance just adds to the mix. By all means, if you like to laugh, please see Tommy Boy.  It is one to own IMHO, and I think you'll enjoy it.  If you don't enjoy comedy, then why are you here anyway?  No deep message, no morality play, no Oscar, just funny stuff, and some belly laughs!dlc 7/01",Tommy Boy
101,Jarvis-6,Farley's Brilliance,10,25 January 1999,"For fans of Chris Farley, this is probably his best film.  David Spade plays the perfect cynical, sarcastic yin to Farley's ""Baby Huey"" yang.  Farley achieves strokes of comic genius in his monologues, like the ""Let's say you're driving along the road with your family..."" bit, the  ""Jo-Jo the Idiot Circus Boy with a pretty new pet, (his possible sale)"" speech, or the ""Glue-sniffing Guarantee fairy"" brake pad sale.

Tommy Boy (Chris Farrely) is about a not-so-smart, funny-fat-guy and he just passed college and he is going to take over his dad's family auto company. After he comes home he finds out that his dad is marrying a very beautiful woman, but when the wedding starts, Tommy Boy's dad dies. Now he has to save his family's company with the help of his dad's assistant (David Spade). This is really one of the top ten funniest comedies ever. There is a laugh out loud joke every minute. I would recommend this to ANYONE! This goes next to the funny comedies with Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, My Cousin Vinny, and many others. It is so sad that one of the greatest comedy legends, Chris Farrely, committed suicide. He always makes me laugh in ANY movie he is in. Wherever he is, rest in peace, Tommy Boy.",Tommy Boy
120,Cancer-6,The duo of Spade & Farley ranks up there with Abbot & Costello,10,27 May 1999,"Chris Farley was quite possibly one of the best comedians to come out of SNL in all of its 29 years.  Though he had humorous cameos in such movies as both ""Wayne's World""s, ""Coneheads"", and ""Airheads"", ""Tommy Boy"" was his first starring role.  And definitely his greatest.  This movie has become a classic among my generation (The ones in college now), and I have no idea how many times my friends and I have watched it.  I cried when I heard he had died, but he had fulfilled that classic acting motto: Leave them wanting more.  And let's face it; if he would have continued in the movies he had done lately (Beverly Hills Ninja, Almost Heroes, Dirty Work), his routine would have gotten stale soon.  When he was paired with David Spade, however, that magic spark between the two of them filled the audience.  They played so well of each other: Chris's bumbling and David's insulting, sarcastic retorts.  Nowhere was this clearer than in Tommy Boy.  It was their best roles, and I will always remember them for it.  Classic quotable scenes (not just lines), amazingly stupid physical humor (like the airplane bathroom scene), and superbly campy plotline.  I give it a ten.",Tommy Boy

Since then, I've also seen Black Sheep, which was pretty good, but not as non-stop-funny as Tommy Boy.",Tommy Boy

124,tsnow0071,Best Chris Farley Movie,8,11 May 2005,"This is without a doubt the best Chris Farley movie. Ever. His other films pale by comparison. The combination of Chris' physical antics and David Spade's deadpan straight-man act are perfect. (I mean, like, do you remember the ""puppet show"" scene with the toy cars? ... yeah, that was cool.) Anyway, the supporting performances of Brian Dennehy, Rob Lowe, and Bo Derek are strong without taking over the show. And the appearance of Dan Ackroyd as Mr. Zalinski is priceless; he has some of the best lines in the film. The screenplay is strong and never loses pace. Unlike most of Farley's other films, there are no pregnant pauses in the momentum and the movie never stops to be preachy. The tempo of the film has motion without being manic like Black Sheep (an awful film by comparison) and it doesn't get bogged down with needless story points like Beverly Hills Ninja. There's a touching scene at the end with Farley on his boat talking to his deceased father. But even that's okay since it fits nicely as an epilogue.If you don't see another movie on DVD this summer, then you should get out more. In any case, pick up TOMMY BOY, it's more than worth the price of a rental and, in my opinion, well worth buying. Highly recommended.",Tommy Boy
125,isaneustaedter,Great Movie,10,14 March 2021,"Tommy Boy plays like a smooth jazz song. Due to its heart, humor, skill, and talent you can watch the film again and again. Chris Farley captured all this in this legendary performance.
The way the film foreshadows many of social problems the US is dealing with today with the closing of factory towns is amazing. However, in this film, unlikely hero Tommy Callahan comes to the rescue. This film shows the optimism and culture of 1990s America very well. 10 out of 10 from me!

""This movie doesn't offer much.""  ""Where is the metaphor, the art, etc.""  Tommy Boy isn't the best film in the world, but it sure does amuse me.  Stupid humor or not, this movie has a laugh waiting around every corner.  The acting is good and the timing is better.  There is even a heart felt sweet story going on.  It's a great buddy movie, and a great comedy.  I won't say Chris Farley was a fantastic comic genius, but he was a fantastic comic that would do anything within his power for a laugh (or so I have heard) and it is apparent from watching this film.  This movie never gets old for me, it is like a buddy who comes for a visit to crack jokes, and even though you have heard them before, you still cannot help but laugh.  So I give this movie a high rating for heart, humor, and for not resorting to pie sex as its only gag.  Just have fun with it.  It is a brilliant film for doing what it set out to do, making laughs.

127,The_Athlete,A Comedy Containing Much Humor,9,12 August 2008,"This movie is meant to be a comedy and it succeeds on every comedic level. The physical comedy with Chris Farley, humorous cut-downs between Farley and David Spade, and the funny interactions between the other characters, Farley and Spade make all this possible. This movie takes elements from another great film ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" as two dissimilar people from different backgrounds and who have very different lifestyles are stuck together and forced to travel together. There are also some touching scenes in the film such as when Chris Farley is out on the lake in a small sail boat talking to his deceased father. And through out the movie its clear that Farley's character may be a bit of a screw-up but he has a good heart and tries the best he can to succeed. There are also what seemed to be true life dialog between Farley and Spade, lines that don't seem so scripted but rather how 2 friends talk to each other, I appreciated this as not every joke in life makes you go ""hahaha"" some just make you go ""ha"" and that's what their dialog did at some points in between the ""hahaha"" moments, they didn't always go for the big laugh all the time.",Tommy Boy

If you enjoyed this movie check-out Black Sheep.",Tommy Boy
131,Ergo777,Comedy Masterclass from Farley,10,27 July 2019,"I had only seen two of Chris Farley's other films - Black Sheep, which I thought was so crap I only made it halfway through and Beverly Hills Ninja which did have some really funny moments - but Tommy Boy was far and away his best film. The laughs come pretty much non-stop from start to finish, the film rarely loses any momentum and this only really happens when Farley isn't featuring.
The plot is simple but as a comedy doesn't need to be anything else. This film has so many funny scenes in it. The scene on the lake with the smart kids, the ""other guys brake pads"" speech, explaining why ""he sucks as a salesmen"" to Helen the waitress.
There's too many funny moments to list - whenever Farley is on screen he's funny as hell. The funniest parts for me were the smaller stuff - like right at the start when he's fooling about in his dad's factory - whenever I remember his facials when he is doing the karate kid impersonation, it always makes me smile. Just one of the funniest things i've ever seen.
David Spades character is the perfect foil to the hyperactive Tommy Boy. But his sarcastic observations and putdowns of Farley's character don't come across as nasty as you know that underneath it all they are really friends.
That is another strong element of the film. It has some heartfelt moments, mostly relating to the death of the father, that adds a lot to the mostly zany, slapstick stuff.
This is in my top couple of comedies - up there with Old School, Fletch and Bridesmaids. I don't understand why some so called professional critics rate this film so poorly. Roger Ebert whinges about the failings of the plot - the plot for this film is fine, it moves the story along like its supposed to. It's not meant to be complicated or a mindbender like Inception or Donnie Darko for christ sakes. Also he says ""no one is funny in this film"" - are you f*%ing kidding me? Farley's performance in Tommy Boy is one of the greatest comedic performances of all time. I understand what everyone finds funny isn't all the same, but I just don't see how you can watch this and not be impressed.
If you need cheering up you can't go wrong with Tommy Boy.",Tommy Boy

His memorable performance as Tommy, a son losing his father and trying to keep his company alive, may sound tragic, but the hilariousness that he puts into it makes you forget that.David Spade also ties the story together. Playing Tommy's traveling companion throughout the US to help sell brake pads, his constant sarcasm and criticizing of Tommy keeps you laughing even during some serious times.Just as he has done many times, Chris Farley makes this movie all the more funny by poking fun at himself. For instance, nearer toward the end of the movie, he's sitting on a bench in the city just thinking about how much he messed up. It's a very somber moment. Suddenly, the legs on the side of the bench he's sitting on give way, and the half he's sitting on falls to the ground while the other half remains standing. His response? ""Could've done without that.""I think it's hard to find a movie that makes you crack up without an R rating lately, making Tommy Boy a movie for most audiences.Chris Farley's death, no matter how long ago it was or how many people brush it off, was saddening to everyone, but this movie helps keep his memory alive and using laughter to ease the pain.",Tommy Boy

This was the first film in which this comedy duo displayed their Laurel-and-Hardy-esque brand of humor.  Farley's obvious physical comedy skill is perfectly augmented by Spade's sarcastic take on every situation they find themselves in.This movie stands apart from other comedy movies.  Tommy Boy ranks in with Blues Brothers as a comedic work whose individual scenes and bits stem from the plot, rather than serve to break up the storyline and give the film a disjointed feel as so many other comedic films do.  Thanks to excellent direction by Sagal, every scene is tight and immediately foreshadows or acts out the story being told. He is as much to credit for the film's hilariousness as Farley and Spade are.   The acting of Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd, and many others (see the gas station attendant 22 miles from Davenport) strengthen the film.The film warrants multiple viewings because there are many fine nuaces to the film that may be overshadowed by Farley/Spade.I believe this film is very well-made and is THE funniest movie I have ever seen.",Tommy Boy

I found the comedy to still be funny after more than ten years since it came out.The one thing that I did notice was the music during the dialogue to be distracting and often made the movie very hook than it should have been. The use of songs is fine during the movie but the orchestral background is too busy, too contrived and if the movie was ever to be edited for DVD, I would seriously recommend that the background music be toned down to an almost inaudible level. It has cheapened the overall feel for the whole film and I can see subconsciously why a lot of people have passed it up.The film had a lot of levels working for it on the script, plot and comedy level. It is too bad that the producer and director felt they needed the musical schlock to enhance the mood.

And Farley's character is not alone in his hubris- remember the workman who did not hesitate to let Tommy buff that cylinder because he's the boss' son? It's a real shame that critics did not laud this film more, because it definitely deserves to be seen. It is perhaps also unfortunate that no one was there to help Farley deal with his disease of fat accumulation.

I would've given it 9/10 if I'd watched it in 1995.It starts lame but brings up the game as the movie goes on. It's important to point out that at some points while watching, you feel left-out with some unlinked scenes and phrases. Sometimes actions happen dramatically and doesn't make sense. But we can forgive it as the story is long enough and it would have been a 3 hours movie otherwise.I do recommend it to anyone feeling frustrated or just wants a relief.

158,westra-nich,Tommy Boy Review: A 9er out of 10,9,17 February 2014,"Comedy is one of the most popular genres in the movie business. Many comedies are only good for a few half-hearted laughs. Others are good for a hearty chuckle, but lack a decent plot to make the movie memorable. A select few can connect to the audience with an engaging plot paired with hilarious jokes and lines that everyone will be saying for years to come. Tommy Boy is definitely in the latter of these categories.If an interesting plot is what you're looking for, Tommy Boy delivers. Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley), a fresh college grad, but also a dimwitted goof off, inherits his father's auto part business after his sudden death. His father was a smooth talking, legendary car parts salesman, and the business is in trouble after his death. Tommy must take over the business and is faced with something he's never had in his entire life, responsibility. He embarks on a trip to sell a new line of brake pads in order to save his business, and the jobs of all his workers. He experiences many obstacles and challenges along the way. This plot, paired with a mystery, a love story, and downright hilarious scenes, makes this movie one to remember.Backing up the plot, there is a cast of great actors, including the dynamic duo of Chris Farley and David Spade. These two actors make the movie what it is. The always loud and obnoxious Chris Farley is perfect for the part of Tommy, a loud-mouthed dimwitted fool. David spade is as sarcastic as ever in his portrayal of Richard, the sarcastic know-it-all who accompanies Tommy on the brake pad selling journey. These two very different characters' bickering and disagreements, paired with the ridiculous situations they find themselves, are the main source of humor in this movie.With Tommy and Richard's crazy situations, along with other hilarious moments involving the rest of the supporting cast, Tommy Boy has everything a movie needs to be considered a great comedy. Between the slapstick humor, the crazy situations, the foolish actions and statements of Tommy, the sarcastic retorts of Richard, and the memorable lines that will be repeated by everyone for years, there is hardly any room to stop laughing.Behind every great movie is a great director, and Tommy Boy has Peter Segal to back it up. Peter Segal has made many great comedies including The Longest Yard, 50 First Dates, and Anger Management. He by no means mars his reputation with this movie, but rather bolsters it. The movie is very well done and organized, and keeps the interest of the audience. Tommy Boy is perhaps the best and most memorable of his impressive list of comedies.Even with a great plot, and endless laughs, no movie can be perfect. Tommy Boy, like all comedies has jokes that are a bit over the top and some that fail to be funny. But all in all Tommy Boy is hilarious and a movie worth watching. It is most definitely deserving of a 9er out of 10.",Tommy Boy

Probably nervous because he didn't just want to do things right -- he wanted to do the right things.",Tommy Boy
160,Xpect25,Greatest Comedy,10,4 July 2005,"If you haven't seen Tommy Boy, I just feel sorry for you. Where I live, it's been everyones favorite comedy for ten straight years. Also, Black Sheep is another great one with Chris Farley and David Spade. This movie is pure, clean comedy unlike some of todays films. You'll laugh the hardest you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you hadn't seen it earlier. When Farley and Spade are on the same screen, it's beautiful. They contrast each other perfectly. I don't understand the low rating on this site. It's a shame people rated it so poorly. Spade really has some good one liner sarcasms that are gut splitting, and Farley has idiotic one liners the are hilarious. Even if you don'y like this movie, it gives you social status because its the talk of parties everywhere.",Tommy Boy

162,harispap-75765,A movie that didn't age well.,5,7 May 2017,"An over the top classic ""road trip"" style comedy starring comedian legend, Chris Farley.Peter Segal's movie is full of cliché and almost everything that's happening seems over the top.The main problem with the movie is its screenplay,it is very poorly written and it makes you feel dumb.At least the acting is great,Farley and Spade connected and rocked as a comedy duo.The movie made me laugh but it is nothing more than a passable movie.",Tommy Boy
163,dylancrawford-10874,Great Movie,9,16 January 2019,"Well Done 'Tommy Boy'A good comedy movie is full of laughs and hilarious jokes, a great comedy movie however, has these elements while having a strong storyline and a well-structured plot. I believe Tommy Boy to be a great comedy movie that is loaded with laughs, but does not pull the attention away from the plot. While not entirely family friendly, Tommy Boy is a fun-filled movie that leaves the audience in good spirits after watching it.
Tommy jr. (Chris Farley), after returning from college after seven years, is set to work for his dad's company, Callahan Auto Parts, in the small town of Sandusky, Ohio. Big Tom gives his son Tommy a new office and responsibilities, so they can run the company together as an unstoppable father-son duo. Tommy returns from college and finds another surprise, his father is getting married. Unfortunately, his father suffers from a heart attack at his wedding reception and the business is left without an owner.With the abrupt passing of his father (Brian Dennehy) due to an impromptu heart attack, Tommy must take on new responsibilities and venture on a road trip throughout the U.S with his dad's assistant, Richard (David Spade) to do his best to save his dad's company. He and Richard must sell half a million brake pads in a short span of a few weeks in order to save the family business. The jobs of hundreds of people back in Ohio are resting on the shoulders of Richard and Tommy, who face obstacles including Tommy's family, along the way.Acting performances by Chris Farley and David Spade were exceptional, as usual. Chris Farley's character, Tommy, a young man with below average intelligence, clumsiness and awkward mannerisms, is played beautifully by Farley. The essence of his Saturday Night Live characters are brought to life on screen. He brings the same passion in Tommy Boy as he does in skits like the ""van down by the river"" and others on SNL. Spade was born to play Richard, a sarcastic, witty, and reliable friend with a dry sense of humor who accompanies Tommy in his journey to find his way as a businessman. This part is much like what we have seen Spade play in the past, it resembles his appearances on SNL and Joe Dirt. Tommy Boy was one of Spade's first major roles in a movie, and it helped jumpstart his movie career. These two actors were a big part of the movie's success, along with the script.The film was written by Bonnie and Terry Turner and produced by the well-established Lorne Michaels, whose brilliant mind for comedy shown on Saturday Night Live, is exemplified once again in Tommy Boy. Director Peter Segal more or less started his career after this movie. Tommy Boy was the second movie he directed and it was such a success, it lead him to create other great films like The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, 50 First Dates, and many more, working with other well-known actors such as Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler.While there are many things to love about this film, I do have some gripes with it. Some scenes in the movie take me back to Farley and Spade's performances on Saturday Night Live. For instance, while Richard and Tommy are doing a sales pitch to a potential client, Tommy plays out a horrifying road accident due to faulty brake pads produced by ""the other guys"". This scene makes me forget I'm watching a movie and feels more like a skit on a Saturday night. For a bit in a movie, it feels rather long-winded and doesn't feel like it's a scene meant for a movie, but would be better suited for a comedy show on, oh I don't know, Saturday night.Whether young or old, Tommy Boy is a classic film that everyone can enjoy. The movie holds true to a traditional comedy movie, being fully loaded with jokes and funny bits. This movie also has a wonderfully written script with an engaging plot to keep the audience intrigued. Tommy Boy has something for everyone and I can strongly recommend this film to anyone looking for a hilarious movie with spectacular acting performances, phenomenal direction, and a captivating storyline.",Tommy Boy
164,baritus,Great Comedy,10,5 February 2006,"Tommy Boy is one of those rare movies that will make you laugh out loud even if you're sitting alone in your home watching it on video. It is a genuine tragedy that Chris Farley died so young, given his comic potential. When Tommy Boy first came out, I thought SNL alums Farley and Spade had the potential to be a modern-day Hope/Crosby comedy team- doing a series of movies together, playing more or less the same type of characters and entertaining us with their adventures. Though their subsequent buddy flick, Black Sheep, was a much weaker film, it showed that the duo had the potential to continue churning out comedies while sticking to the basic formula. Had Chris Farley still been alive, he most certainly would have starred alongside Spade in Lost & Found (the buddy part was written with him in mind), and continued the trend. Tommy Boy is one of the most entertaining, quotable, genuinely funny comedies of its generation!",Tommy Boy
165,kaitlinmiller3,Tommy boy is the best movie ever made,10,3 January 2006,"Tommy boy is the best movie ever made. Anyone who disagrees hasn't seen the whole thing or they have no sense of humor. How can anyone not laugh histarically at tommy cow tipping, ripping off Richard's car door, trashing the car, constantly running into walls and doors, and taring apart the airplane bathroom. I mean honestly this movie was so funny no matter how many times you watch it you still laugh just as hard as the first time you saw it. Take my word for it, Tommy boy is an amazing comedic movie, and you will love it! If you are at this site now you obviously enjoy comedies or are a fan of this movie, or are a loooooooser who just wants to make the people in this movie feel bad, and don't want other people to be happy. So really whats your problem you shouldn't be such a drag, thats rude and mean, and cant you find something better to do than insult a movie, at least they are famous. Unlike you, who's probably sitting in your moms basement right now trying to figure out which comic book your going to buy next. You know I'm right. So for everyone else out there who isn't a depressed loooooser go buy or rent this movie!!!",Tommy Boy

167,hazellenwood,in this moment they were perfect,9,24 April 2006,"this movie was so damn good it was unpredictable. there's no way the people involved with its production had an idea of just how spot-on they were being in the decisions they made. the reason i say this is because so much of what made me laugh in this movie was not the dialog necessarily, but the chemistry between chris farley and David spade. their ability to bounce of one another and give each other the necessary room for their dialog was so amazing to watch. unfortunately both of these men are limited now in the roles they are offered. David spade is forever the snide little _______ and chris farley is, well, he's eternal.",Tommy Boy
