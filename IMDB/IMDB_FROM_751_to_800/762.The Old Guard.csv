0,Leofwine_draca,Not bad at all,7,25 June 2021,"Pretty good for a modern comic book action story. Seems to be a lot of negative reviews floating around but I couldn't see anything much to dislike about this. A nicely diverse cast featuring a lot of nationalities you don't often see on screen in a mainstream movie, and nice to have no stale male white leads. Charlize Theron cements her talent for action cinema after MAD MAX: FURY ROAD and gives another good physical performance. The story of immortality is interesting background for a familiar 'good guys vs. Sinister organisation' tale, it's not very deep but it has plentiful well choreographed action to see it through.",The Old Guard
1,nogodnomasters,Some Good means nothing,8,1 August 2020,"Andy (Charlize Theron) short for Andromeda, the Andromeda leads a group of near immortals on select missions to save lives and eat baklava. Andy says they don't do repeats, but if you watched ""6 Underground"" you know Netflix does. They go on a mission to Sudan for Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor ) which was a set-up. Copley suspects the groups power and want to turn them over to Merrick Pharma. Rather than approach them with a proposal, he opts to gun them all down and make up later. This scenario didn't make any sense at all.This looks like a two hour pilot for a series that promises to be better. And they have the ability to drop people out and bring new ones in.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Old Guard
2,kosmasp,Really old,7,26 July 2020,"So if you didn't inform yourself (I only found out watching Charlize Theron in talk shows promoting the movie), this is based on a graphic novel series. Which makes sense if you watch it - this having a background before the film was made. Now even so, that doesn't mean this will be free of cliches - quite the opposite is true.Theron is really good and while as I mentioned you will and should be able to predict what is going to happen (even certain ""twists""/betrayals and so forth). But the action is more than rock solid, even without knowing that Theron took her training very seriously! Who else would be driving around with a very real looking prop axe? Exactly! So while I understand that some might be cynical about the whole thing, you are missing out on just having fun with this. It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it doesn't pretend to be either",The Old Guard
3,classicsoncall,"""You haven't figured this out yet? You can't die!""",7,6 January 2021,"I didn't know this movie was based on a series of comics, turned graphic novel, until reading about it in other reviews on this board. During the movie, Charlize Theron's character is referred to at one point as an 'eternal warrior', which was actually the title of another comic book published by Valiant Comics back in the early to mid Nineties, and then rebooted in 2012 after the company went through a series of changes. So it wouldn't surprise me if the concept for this film was lifted from the original 'Eternal Warrior', which was one of my favorites from that company.So given that as a premise, the movie is about a quartet of immortals led by Andromache the Scythian (Theron), Andy for short, who become the target of a big pharma executive who intends to capture them and harvest their genetic material for the stated goal of improving humanity. These things never seem to go well because the financial aspect of tinkering with people's lives always becomes an intended consequence of the big money folks, and those with integrity want no part of it. The story line eventually brings a fifth player into the fold who also has an immortal gene factor, and after a period of difficult adjustment, begins to accept her role as an undying warrior.The picture has a decent amount of action sequences, with much of the stunts actually performed by the principal players themselves. A number of flashbacks relate to the adventures of the main characters from eons ago, although no particular age is specifically attached to any of the characters. There's also a minor hitch to the whole immortality business, as that invincibility factor can begin to fade with virtually no preview as to when it will occur. So when Andy's healing factor no longer applies after suffering a couple of bad wounds, it appears that she faces a certain future after all. But then, hold on, because one of Andy's battle partners from ancient times, exiled to the bottom of the ocean, turns up in a closing scene almost good as new. In comic books and movies, there's really no such certain thing as death (and maybe taxes). Just ask Superman.",The Old Guard
4,Tweekums,Solid action with a group of immortal soldiers,8,11 July 2020,"This film is centred on a small group of soldiers who have one thing in common; they are to all intents and purposes immortal. When they are approached to rescue a group of kidnapped girls in South Sudan they leader, Andy, is wary but takes the mission. She was right to be wary; the client, ex-CIA operative Copley, believes their natural abilities can be used to advance medicine. Copley intends to hand them over to Merrick; the head of a large pharmaceutical company. The group manage to escape and determine to find Copley; as they travel they each share a vision... a new immortal has come into existence; a US Marine named Nile who has just been 'killed' in Afghanistan. Andy determines to bring her into the group. Now the team will have a tough time stopping themselves being taken by Merrick's private army and ultimately saving themselves.I really enjoyed this film; it provided plenty of exciting action from start to finish. Thankfully not that much time is wasted on explaining their back-story; there are a few flashbacks to events long ago which serve to explain why they behave as they do; particularly their fear of capture. So give the characters more depth. Other key information is told to the viewer as it is told to Nile. The cast is solid; most obviously Charlize Theron who really impresses as Andy; Kiki Layne is good as new girl Nile and Chiwetel Ejiofor is nicely ambiguous as Copley. On the downside Merrick was too much the pantomime villain; issuing plenty of threats but without feeling threatening. Overall though I enjoyed this and would recommend it to those who enjoy action films. The ending implied to possibility of a sequel; if there is one I'd watch it.",The Old Guard
5,LeonLouisRicci,"""THE IMMORTALS"" OF OLD ARE STILL GUARDING HUMANITY FROM EVIL",7,26 August 2021,"It's an ""Old Story"" about the ""Gods"" of Antiquity who Became Myth and Legend Fighting for Mankind on the Side of ""Justice"".Now We are in 2020 and They're Still Active, because You Know, Immortal and All.Enter Nerd-Villain who Wants the DNA to Benefit, scratch that, to Make as Much Money as Possible while in Tandem Benefiting Mankind.So the Chase is On and Although the Team is Immortal They seem Relatively Easy Prey for the Nerd-Scientist-Villain.And Captured They Are, Almost All of Them, and it's up to the Newly Discovered ""Immortal"" to Rescue the Team.That's the Plot.

6,CinemaSerf,The more bodyguards you have the less safe you are....,7,11 July 2020,"This is a much better action adventure from Netflix - a team of immortal crimefighters have to stay one step ahead of a megalomanic scientist who wants their DNA for nefarious purposes. Charlize Theron demonstrates it's easy to be a hard-ass character without the need for bling, excessive ""attitude"" and loads of effing and jeffing; and there certainly aren't many fantasy themes that feature a couple of no-messing gay blokes, too. KiKi Layne (""Nile"") is a bit wooden, though she does warm to the role; Harry Melling isn't at all impressive as the geeky billionaire scientist driving the whole thing; the writing is a bit on the dry side - though there are a few smile-raising moments and it's probably 15/20 minutes too long. Sure, much of it is nothing new but I still enjoyed it.",The Old Guard
7,zardoz-13,Charlize Theron and Immortal Warriors,7,21 July 2020,"Imagine the mercenaries in the Sylvester Stallone film franchise ""The Expendables"" endowed with powers such that they can miraculously heal their own wounds in combat, and you've got the gist of the new Netflix action epic ""The Old Guard,"" starring Charlize Theron, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and KiKi Layne. Clocking in at 125 minutes, this $70-million, B-movie melodrama chronicles the tireless efforts of a crime-busting, ""A-Team"" quartet of apparently immortal warriors, commanded by a woman, who have fought for centuries trying to save mankind from its own destructive urges. Mind you, Greg Rucka's 2017 graphic novel of the same name, illustrated fantastically by Leandro Fernandez, provides the basis for this outlandish but imaginative adventure outing. Moreover, Rucka adapted his graphic novel for African-American director Gina Prince-Bythewood, whose credits include ""Love & Basketball"" (2000) and ""The Secret Life of Bees"" (2008). This unusual change-of-pace helming represents Prince-Bythewood's first foray into blood and guts cinema. Rucka and she have excised some of the excessive elements from his deliriously graphic novel. For example, nobody smokes cigarettes. Since nothing can kill these pugnacious warriors, the last thing they worry about is lung cancer. In our politically correct, ultra-sensitive era, a mass media conglomerate cannot produce a movie that clashes with our current ideology. While this streaming Netflix movie landed an R-rating for blood-splattered, CGI-violence, Rucka's ""fairy tale of blood and bullets"" goes overboard exotic with violence galore. The first installment of ""The Old Guard"" series is far more chilling and thrilling than the straitlaced film could ever contemplate. Anybody who reads the graphic novel or craves such literary material is forewarned that Rucka and Fernandez have written and illustrated the story in a five-part series.This band of warriors follows the lead of the oldest warrior, nicknamed Andy (Charlize Theron of ""Atomic Blond""), who has been fighting for over two millennia. Andromache of Scythia is her actual name, but she calls herself Andy. During a flashback sequence, she straddles a horse and wields an enormous tennis racket-shaped ax with devastating savagery in the company of another ferocious female, Quynh (Van Veronica Ngo of ""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi""), and these two dames endure the ravages of war and social unrest. Eventually, in the Middle Ages, they are captured and hanged as witches. For once the religious zealots who quote scripture over them as they swing from the gibbet know they are genuine witches since they don't die. These zealots decide Andy and Quynh are too formidable to be destroyed together, so they separate them. They lock Quynh up in the equivalent of an iron maiden. Andy vows to rescue her, but the evil priests ship Quynh off on a long ocean voyage and sink the iron maiden in which she is trapped at a random spot on the high seas. Neither Andy nor her team has ever been able to get enough eyewitness accounts to pinpoint where the priests plunged Quynh into the briny deep. Predictably, this sours Andy's appetite for life, but she soldiers on despite Quynh's disappearance. Since this tragedy, Andy has recruited Joe (Marwan Kenzari of ""Aladdin"") and Nicky (Luca Marinelli of ""Martin Eden""), who crossed swords during the First Crusade then later became eternal lovers. The most recent recruit was Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts of ""Red Sparrow""), who served under Napoleon during his disastrous Russian campaign. Booker emerges as the weakest link. Like vampires who have lived too long to appreciate life, Booker wants to die. Nevertheless, like Andy, Booker keeps on keeping on with his agenda.
These immortal warriors, it seems, are destined to meet. Nightmares plague them about a warrior like them who has mutated from ordinary to extraordinary! Moreover, the nightmares don't cease until they can trace their new chum. The latest recruit is a U.S. Marine, Nile Freeman (KiKi Layne of ""Captive State""), a black female in charge of a squad in Afghanistan. She dies trying to save an enemy soldier hiding behind women to create bombs. One of her buddies cradles the mortally wounded Nile in her arms as Nile bleeds out from a knife wound in her neck. Everybody is shocked when she recovers none the worse for wear at a military field hospital, and her superiors book her a flight aboard the next transport for a U.S. base in Germany for further scrutiny. Looking a lot like rock star David Bowie, Andy penetrates the base security and abducts Nile. Of course, Andy has a tough time convincing this incredulous Marine that she has the gift of immortality. Eventually, after an acrobatic fight aboard a C-47 in flight over the desert, Nile abandons her escape attempts from Andy and joins the team. By this time, a former CIA spook, Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor of ""Serenity""), has double-crossed Andy and her covert team. He leaked word of their supernatural status to Merrick (Harry Melling of the ""Harry Potter"" movies), a depraved magnate of a British pharmaceutical firm. Merrick wants whatever these immortals have to market eternal life to millions.""The Old Guard"" qualifies as an above-average, but preposterous combat potboiler with unique heroes. Nevertheless, the film lacks the rampant cynicism and wholesale violence of Rucka's graphic novel. Although she has a lot to learn about choreographing blood and guts action epics, Gina Prince-Bythewood never lets the exposition drown out the fireworks. The performances are all vigorous, with Theron and company nimbly knocking down Merricks' black-clad commando henchmen like bowling alley tenpins. The body count mounts into double digits, but sometimes the action seems farcical, especially when Nile shoots herself in the foot on purpose. The scene where we first learn about their survivalist skills is surprising, but things settle down into business as a bloody routine. Harry Melling steals the show as the ruthless big pharma CEO who trusts nobody and stabs one of the ""Old Guard"" elite repeatedly before he believes Copley's incredible video of their massacre and subsequent revival.",The Old Guard
8,Calicodreamin,Too much and yet almost not enough,6,11 July 2020,"Conceptually very strong, loved the characters and they have great chemistry. However, there's so much information trying to be conveyed that the main storyline gets lost. This would make for a great series but it's too much for a 2 hr movie. But great acting and the action choreography is intense.",The Old Guard
9,neil-476,Quite good,8,14 March 2021,"A group of 4 hard-asses led by Andy (Charlize Theron) are rather wearily engaged in covert operations to fight for those who can't fight for themselves. They have an advantage: you can't kill them. You can try, but they heal very fast. They are various ages, but Andy is the oldest, dating back to pre-Christian times. There are two main elements to the plot. One, another immortal turns up, very reluctant to accept what she is. And, two, an uppity young millionaire scientist decides that there are megabucks to be made from marketing the cure-all which surely lies within the blood of these mavericks: this will mean trapping them and holding them captive, however.Coming from comics writer Greg Rucka, this contains few surprises for anyone familiar with the comic tropes which underlie it, but I quite liked a lot of it. The action is good, the two plot threads both work well, and the palpable weariness felt by these four individuals who have done nothing but fight for centuries is well conveyed.The ending sets up a sequel. I hope they make one.",The Old Guard
10,trashgang,slow and boring moments,5,11 July 2020,"Matthias Schoenaerts was the reason that I watched this flick and Charlize wanting to work with him, well, great expectations. But this afternoon I was told that it wasn't a good movie and so I watched it 1 day after its release.I must say, I never really get into the story. There's a lot of blah blah and action but for me it didn't work out. Acting is okay but some scene's are too long or too slow. And for an action flick this is a no-go.Bringing in the sci-fi aspect is okay and the flashbacks are also okay but overall I found it just on the edge of boredom. It's sad to say because I do like Matthias and Charlize but this time it's a fail.

11,deloudelouvain,"Good entertaining story, bad soundtrack.",7,20 September 2020,"It's obvious there will be another movie after this one and I'm fine with that. The Old Guard has the potential to make several more stories about this subject. It's well written, no real dull moments in the movie (even though the sequences with music were a bit lame), a lot of good action and fighting scenes, and a well chosen cast that did a good job playing their characters. But it's not flawless, some small details that don't make much sense but nothing really cringing to watch. The soundtrack was in my opinion the negative point of the movie, some bad songs that ruin some scenes that clearly didn't need that kind of lame music. But other than that it's an entertaining movie, from beginning till the end, hopefully the sequel will be of the same quality, minus the soundtrack then.",The Old Guard
12,siderite,An interesting premise wasted on mediocre development,7,6 August 2020,"The immortal beings that try to remain hidden from humans for various reasons has been done to death, but this film brings a little bit of freshness with the idea that they are heroes and victims, not monsters or gods. Charlize is amazing as always, too, and the shooting scenes pretty good. But this is where the goodness ends. There are a lot of enemies, but they are either the dumb masked soldier type that dies without any contribution or psychopaths that try to take over the world and their slightly more competent lieutenants. And then there is the obligatory pandering to social agendas, with the ""common"" character (that we are supposed to identify with) being a black woman and a gay romance between two other characters. And I really thought they were going to go somewhere with it, yet they did not. It was simply another pointless part of the story that brought nothing to the table.I liked all of the actors, even if I thought some of them were wasted on the script. The action coordinator knew where they were doing. There was clearly some budget associated with this and the clear desire to turn this into either a series of film or a TV show. So how come they can't come up with the extra oomph to make the story shine and every character serve a meaningful purpose that transcends cardboard cliche?Bottom line: a lot of potential wasted on a mediocre film.",The Old Guard

14,thesar-2,At the Real Edge of Tomorrow,9,16 July 2020,"Old Man Logan, you got nothing on the next gen.I haven't seen an emotional action movie like this since T2. This movie carried so many near tears with it, I barely see it as an action movie. And just like Charlize Theron's other Atomic Blonde, it really shouldn't be seen as an action flick.Yes, there are action scenes and set-ups, but overall, this is a sci-fi drama with action thrown into the mix. Its world building and emotion that I found myself most attracted to.The following isn't spoilers per se, but I would avoid any further reading as going in as cold as possible has to be the best experience. So. Ready? Stop now. Fine, we're moving ahead.The magnificent and always immortal, no pun, Charlize Theron leads a band of apparent immortals bent on correcting the world's mistakes. Only, the stakes are clear: one's time is up when their time is up. So, we never really know, do we?I digress. In this fabulous film, Charlize and her immortal gang take a botched mission that simultaneously sets them on a journey of the next gen and seeks out to end a horrible crime boss bent on curing the future.Yes, I was vague as possible. But, know this: I LOVE THIS MOVIE. It was incredibly well shot, well-acted, progressive, emotional, advanced and always took its premise straight. So to speak. They - the cast AND crew never broke character. I believed in them from beginning to end, in front of or behind the camera.Helps I love Charlize Theron, beyond belief, but this movie is SO MUCH MORE than just her. And I believe she knew that, too.The film is so heartbreaking and uplifting and this is exactly what I wanted from 2017's Logan but that movie was WAY TOO DEPRESSING. This one has the hope angle I desired.Again, as much as I love Charlize, I will endless criticize her Atomic Blonde movie for having 15 min of action in her almost 2-hour film. This might have had the same screen time of action, but the deep emotional blows made up for the downtime. I cannot highly recommend this enough and welcome any sequel. Or not. This can stand alone and I will be satisfied.***Final thoughts: Aside from Atomic Blonde's misleading ""action movie"" status, there really hasn't been a movie starring Charlize Theron I haven't liked. Ok, maybe Hancock, but she was still great in it! Fine, Reindeer Games - also bad. But still, she's always amazing. Look, I would go str8 for her. THAT'S how I feel.",The Old Guard
15,FeastMode,fails to live up to the promise of its premise,4,17 July 2020,"Once again netflix has a movie with a really cool premise and tone. once again netflix bungles the execution. this movie isn't bad. i enjoyed a lot of it. it had some cool action scenes. but there was no momentum.there was a bunch of stupid stuff and things that bothered me. and it just didn't feel like a hollywood-level movie. felt typical in many ways. and there were some aspects of the movie where i could see what they were trying to do, but they just didn't do it well enough for it to land with any sort of impact. charlize is still awesome (1 viewing, 7/16/2020)",The Old Guard

17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Time after time.,7,13 July 2020,"Charlize Theron continues her transition into full-blown action hero with 'The Old Guard (2020)', a fantasy flick about a group of immortal warriors on the run from so-called 'big pharma' and its probing experiments. The story feels rather like a pilot, establishing its characters and core concepts in a way that seems primed for a long-running franchise. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the affair still manages to stand on its own as an enjoyable piece of action cinema and, more importantly, any sequels its ending may hint towards are more than welcome. The film is a fair bit of fun when it gets going, treating its inherently outlandish central idea with utter sincerity but never feeling self-important or dour. It's rather grounded, actually, and that's a fair bit of what makes it so successful. The other key ingredient is its cast, who all turn in excellently down-to-earth performances and bring some much needed nuance to even the most generic of moments. There are some genuinely emotional scenes and the drama never feels perfunctory. In fact, the piece isn't afraid to sit with its quieter moments. On occasion, this does translate to expository dumps that are a little clumsy. Luckily, the lore that's discussed is usually rather intriguing. The movie also has quite a few exciting action sequences, which tend to use its characters' regenerative abilities to a somewhat interesting effect. Though sometimes slightly too frenetic for their own good, these scenes are enjoyable and well-choreographed. You can tell a lot of work was put into them and that the actors did a lot of their own stunts, too. For me, the affair's biggest flaw - and this is probably even more subjective than anything I've written so far - is its soundtrack. The score is peppered with pop songs that feel really out of place, clashing with the established tone and taking you out of the experience. Still, this is a relatively minor issue in the grand scheme of things. Though it isn't perfect, the film is entertaining throughout. It's rather generic and, on occasion, gets in its own way, but it's typically a fun time. I'd be more than happy to watch a sequel. 7/10",The Old Guard
18,ThomasDrufke,Potential,7,11 September 2020,"The Old Guard is one of the better Netflix Original films of the last few years, but that isn't necessarily saying much. Typically their speciality has been in TV but they have attempted to step up their game with bigger budgeted films, in comes The Old Guard at 70 million. With high stakes, a cool premise, and a well-rounded cast The Old Guard was one of the hits of the summer. Sadly, I couldn't stand the swarmy (Jesse Eisenberg inspired Lex Luthor style) villain. It was unbearable every time he was on screen. So perhaps a sequel with a fleshed out villain could prove to be the element that makes this (soon-to-be) franchise go to new heights. But we'll see.7.0/10",The Old Guard
19,Cineanalyst,Out with the Old,6,11 July 2020,"""The Old Guard"" is at its best when defying expectations. It begins as several Netflix action-flick duds have, with a gang of mostly-white saviors traveling to an exotic land to rescue racial ""others."" Captain America, Chris Evans, did it in ""Red Sea Diving Resort"" (2019). Thor, Chris Hemsworth, too, with ""Extraction"" (2020). Batman, Ben Affleck, however, just went after the cash, which figures, in ""Triple Frontier"" (2019). Then, there was also Michael Bay's version of a Justice League led by Deadpool's Ryan Reynolds getting into all sorts of mischief across the globe in ""6 Underground"" (2019). In other words, Netflix programming has well established a formula here. Any variation in this is welcomed in place of repetition, so I appreciate that ""The Old Guard"" exploits these long-standing (that is, they're hardly exclusive to Netflix), racially-charged tropes to ensnare a team of immortals. Tellingly, this first act is followed by the team's plans of revenge being upended, at least momentarily, by the emergence of a new immortal, who is also a black woman. Not that this team was exactly regressive in their advanced ages before this, though, as we also discover that two members are gay lovers who fought on opposite sides of the Crusades, as unbelievable as maintaining a romantic relationship spanning hundreds of years may seem.This isn't so much rewarding as a reflection of progressive politics or inclusivity of gender, racial or sexual representation, either, as it is an effective upturning of a century or more of cinematic precedent, including those aforementioned Netflix releases. Like the immortals in the movie, this goes back much further. Adventures such as ""Gunga Din"" (1939), for example, and other such films echoing the centuries of colonialism and, yes, the Crusades, too. One of the lovers does go off with a lecture on their relationship in one scene, but it still comes across as more natural and sincere than, say, the self-congratulatory groupings of women for a scene each in the last two Avengers movies. On a lesser note, but also befitting the untraditional nature of a superhero movie for streaming, these supernaturally-gifted beings mostly use guns. Makes more sense, even if one is immortal, I would think, that one fire a rifle at baddies instead of tossing a shield or hammer. There's still, of course, a lot of the requisite quick cuts for Charlize Theron's hand-to-hand combat, as well as the gang's singular superpower essentially making them redundancies of the likes of Wolverine and Deadpool, and Theron's character does have a fondness for axes, but on that last account we may chalk it up to habits practiced over millennia being hard to break. The score isn't particularly effective, either, and isn't exploited heavily here during the action scenes, but that's a minor complaint.On one hand, too, I wish more had been done with the characters having lived manifold lifetimes--especially beyond brief references to first editions of ""Don Quixote"" or to Rodin originals. Besides indicating that they've lived to see the birth of the modern novel and modern sculpture, as well as all those wars, all we get here is a crazy board suggesting that Theron's superheroics have been behind much of all good things throughout history and a tease for a sequel involving her friend, another immortal, lost at sea in some sort of iron maiden back in the days when their superpowers got them tried for witchcraft. On the other hand, I'm afraid they would've screwed up such a concept if they tried to delve too deeply. Perhaps, it's better than that the focus remain on fleeting attempts by the usual corporate baddies to exploit their gifts, as well as the eventual actual mortality of the so-called immortals, and the relative youth of their new recruit. Yet, most of all, I've just missed superhero blockbusters--one of the main attractions of going to cinemas the past decade or so. With so many of the releases for Marvel, DC and whomever installments being delayed due to the pandemic, ""The Old Guard"" was a welcome diversion and reminder of that past life.",The Old Guard
20,secondtake,Well done and familiar territory,6,21 October 2020,"The Old Guard (2020)This starts beautifully, with a combination of intrigue and international espionage. You only learn after awhile that the main characters are superpower types-immortals. And this changes the mood, but only slowly and logically.
Then the plot shifts a little too much to explaining who they are and how their gifts show up (and their limitations).So it slows a little, because in fact this doesn't drive the narrative forward and is pretty standard stuff. But the acting is sharp and the whole mise-en-scene well done, very well done.Mortality--and avoiding it--drives the movie, with a villain who wants the secret to it all, and some infighting. A lot of familiar tropes at work, so what propels the movie is just that it's done well. That won't be enough for many people.",The Old Guard

For me the concept itself carried this movie. I wasn't that blown away by action in this movie which was pretty good by itself, but i liked the idea so much that i would love for characters to simply sit and just talk and teorise about the main concept, which i won't spoil. ""The Old Guard"" is like ""The Highlander"" meets ""The Man from Earth"" but with much bigger budget.Overall, i liked the concept of this movie very much. I would love to see a sequel.

There's something fresh about this version and its take on immortality that offers more emotional substance than previous stereotypical storylines. The action plot is pretty standard but its presentation somehow avoids the continued standard mayhem of recent action thrillers (Taken, Wick, John Reacher). Probably one weakness is its rather fumbling attempts as a sequel that disrupts the more emotionally sensitive denouement (climax) that the script appeared to be leading the audience towards.",The Old Guard

The first act really grabbed me and I was interested to see where this was going. Sadly, though, I was not happy with the way the film panned out. After a promising start, the film went in an entirely different direction and became just another film about a greedy man seeking power (not powers).Charlize Theron stars as the film's protagonist, Andy, and she delivers a good performance. You could see she was giving it her all. Unfortunately most of the action sequences revolved around killing dozens of security guards - whom I'm not supposed to care about, but all the killings were unnecessary - like a John Wick movie (ugh!!!).There was a lot of talk and emotion in the film as well, but these quieter moments were actually very interesting and made me root for the main characters. Harry Melling starred as the antagonist, Merrick, but I found him a weak and passive character. There was also nothing special about the camera work.Despite some good scenes (mostly in the beginning) 'The Old Guard' is a film I won't be interested in seeing again.",The Old Guard
24,cruise01,Good action but lacks in depth with characters.,7,11 July 2020,The Old Guard (3.5 out of 5 stars).The Old Guard is a pretty fair superhero film. About a group of immortals living through centuries. Fighting bad guys and bad organizations. The plot was good. The film does have a few good action sequences. The cast ensemble was also good. Charlize Theron can lead as an action star. The script does lack in building characterization. And the soundtrack makes it feel like a young teen series on cw channel. Which feels out of place than working with the tone of the movie.,The Old Guard
25,eddie_baggins,Another Netflix stinker,2,14 July 2020,"If there's one thing Netflix have a proven track record in, its in their unfortunate ability to turn projects that on paper seem destined for good things, into final products that are all types of disappointing.Joining the likes of Mute, Fractured, Bright, In the Tall Grass, Velvet Buzzaw and a large collection of other mediocre/genuinely bad efforts, Netflix's newest high profile effort, an adaptation of Greg Rucka and Leandro Fernandez's cult graphic novel series The Old Guard, is their newest disappointment.Helmed by long-serving director Gina Prince-Bythewood and backed by a significant cast, that is championed by the always game Charlize Theron (channeling her Aeon Flux/Atomic Blonde vibes) whose support by an international cast that includes up-comer Kiki Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari and a criminally underused Chiwetel Ejiofor, Old Guard seems like a sure-fire good time but this generic, lethargic and spectacle free affair is DOA.The premise of a group of immortal soldiers/mercenaries that are lead by Theron's seemingly 1000 year old Andy should make for a no doubt silly but care-free good time but the films po-faced delivery, lame plot line of Layne's newly minted immortal Nile learning the ropes of her abilities and an even worse villain story arc in the form of Dudley Dursey's (aka Harry Melling) millionaire pharmacist CEO Merrick trying to track down and capture Andy and her crew ensure that Old Guard never feels like its building to delivering anything of note.Films of this ilk with such fanciful plots and larger than life characters (the immortals underutilized back stories in key moments of history would've made for far more interesting cinematic moments) are best when they embrace their DNA but Bythewood is unable to capture any of those moments in her weak direction that anchors down any chance Old Guard had of at least providing the bang visually in spite of its toothless plot.When we are blessed as movie fans with the likes of John Wick, Mission Impossible and even to a lesser extent Netflix's own Extraction, the action and spectacle we get in Old Guard feels like nothing short of a letdown and when the characters enacting in these shootouts and fisticuffs are so uninteresting, there's no chance the film had of being an over the top good time.It would also be remiss of me not to mention that films horrifically out of place soundtrack featuring the likes of Frank Ocean, Blithe and Khalid is also a major flaw in the film.Aiming to be hip and perhaps moody? The over-used and cringe-worthy selection of songs constantly grate against what is being seen on screen, appearing to be a hack job added at the last minute for no apparent reason or rhyme.Final Say -Don't believe what you've seen from a large collection of critics, The Old Guard is a tiresome and lifeless action affair that squanders its talented cast and potentially fun story on an effort that is not worth your two hours of investment.1 poorly chosen song out of 5",The Old Guard

Even Charlize Theron cannot save this one from its mediocrity.Last notes: in the Highlander movies we watch immortals battle each other, but how interesting is the concept of immortals fighting against mortals!? Also, how stupid is the notion of those four immortals that they can change with guns and blades the course of human history in a greater scale!?

32,southdavid,Atomic Bland,6,14 July 2020,"Another heavily advertised Netflix film, with a star name attached, that perhaps does well to open here rather than avoiding the critical eyes of a cinematic release. Not that it's bad, just that it's not really got anything new to say.Adapted from the graphic novel, by the writer Greg Rucka, ""The Old Guard"" tells the story of a small band of immortals who have, for centuries, tried their best to guide humanity in the right direction whilst remaining in the shadows. An unscrupulous pharmaceutical company learns about their regenerative powers and tries to capture them for experimentation, at the same time as a new member, Nile (Kiki Layne) discovers her ability for the first time.So, this is another film that I'm struggling to come up with a better adjective for than 'fine'. Everything about it is OK, performances, bit of action, visual effects all alright and the story just about does its job, there's a painfully obvious twist about two thirds of the way through, but the rest is OK. The flip side of that is that it's lacking in invention. There's little you haven't seen before and its po-faced tone can make some of the scenes feel like a bit of a slog. Theron has become a credible action star over the last few years and this is another entry on that run for her. She leads a cast that's (here's that word again) fine, though the film does deserves some credit for a gay relationship that isn't either merely hinted at, or artificially crowbarred in to tick off a quota, but is important to the motivations of the pair and of other characters.There's a sequel strongly hinted at, and much discussed by the cast and director prior to its release - if it happens I'd probably watch it but I also feel that I'm going to struggle to remember what this was about in three months' time.",The Old Guard

35,Vartiainen,Fantastic action movie,8,21 July 2020,"There are those that will claim that The Old Guard is clichéd. That it's nothing new. And in a way those people are right. This film is not revolutionary. It's not going to change how we see film. How we do film. But it's still a borderline masterpiece. Why? Because in the end, execution is everything.Charlize Theron plays Andy, the leader of a group of immortals. People who throughout history have discovered that they cannot die, no matter what is done to them. But it's the 21st century and their carefully guarded veil of secrecy is thinner than ever. And just as a nefarious Big Pharma CEO gets on their trail, a new immortal awakens.What makes The Old Guard so great is not its originality but rather its passion. These are clichéd characters, these are clichéd ideas. But the film makers believe in them. Every single immortal is given a scene or two to shine. They're complete three-dimensional characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, virtues and vices. Naturally Theron's Andy, or rather Andromache of Scythia, is at the forefront, as is Nile (KiKi Layne), the new immortal, but none of the characters is neglected.And that's refreshing. So often these movies focus on one or two characters, while relocating the rest to easily consumed stereotypes. Forgetting that it only takes one really good scene to establish a character. That's all you need, if you know what you're doing.Furthermore, the action is well directed and choreographed. Not quite as slick as John Wick, but cut from the same cloth, which is in no way a hindrance or a flaw.If I had to name a flaw, I'd say the villain played by Harry Melling is a bit weak and that the backstory of these immortals is sometimes explained a bit wonkily. But these are more nitpicks than outright deterrents.I hope we see a sequel. I had a blast watching this and I'm comfortable already calling it one of the best films of the year 2020.",The Old Guard

That was in English and that was good)I can clearly see it could be so much better and it was not.To think, five mouths ago I would have ran to the theatre and been really disappointed at the money I spent to see this.Honesty, it was perfect to watch at home on Netflix at least.",The Old Guard
38,jtindahouse,"A terrible concept, no fun and extremely slow",3,16 August 2020,"Charlize Theron just doesn't do it for me I'm afraid. She has ruined some of my most anticipated projects in the past - 'Dark Places' and 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' are the first ones that come to mind - and while I had no anticipation for 'The Old Guard' I still can't help feeling it would've been a lot better with another actress in that role. I understand that her character is supposed to be tired and sick of living (what a fun concept for your lead character, right?), but man she dragged the film down. She (and every character to be fair) took herself very seriously. The film isn't a lot of fun. So if you don't buy into the serious storyline the movie is throwing at you, there is basically nothing to fall back on.Why would the concept of immortal characters be fun to anyone? People who can't die have nothing at stake. They obviously realised this, because they start to phone something in about them being terrified of being caught, but come on. It just makes no sense to base a story around a concept like that. Oh look they're in a gun fight, I hope they come out of this all right... oh wait, never mind. For this reason I had real trouble getting on board with whatever it was the film was trying to make itself about. I simply didn't care by the end. The movie is only two hours, but it genuinely felt closer to three.Finally, the pacing is painfully slow. The film is so intent on setting up a universe (and obviously multiple sequels based on the final scene) that is forgets to be its own, fun film.

Stars: Marwan Kenzari as Joe, Matthias Schoenaerts as Booker, Charlize Theron as Andy, Luca Marinelli as Nicky, Kiki Layne as Nile.This big budget action flick features a rich backstory with some intriguing mythological elements. This film is lead by two strong female leads with a brilliantly diverse cast and a female director. Charlize Theron continues to cement her crown as the Queen of action following her phenomenal performances in Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde. Andy, aka Andromache the Scythian, is the leader of the immortal warriors; she's a complete badass who's proficient with pretty much every weapon and fighting style. Theron balances her terrific gift for fight sequences with an impressive emotional depth, as it's clear to see Andy cares very deeply for her extended family following her tragic backstory.Newcomer to the group Nile, played by the fantastic KiKi Layne, straight away has a wonderfully endearing chemistry with Theron's Andy, as the two give a new spin of the veteran/rookie trope. Smartly prioritizing the bond of relationships.Featuring a number of high-octane action sequences and well choreographed fight scenes, the film packs a lot of punch into the runtime. There's multiple styles of hand-to-hand combat with both new and old weapons included.With an impressive array of layered performances and action-packed fight sequences, The Old Guard proves an interesting take on the action, fantasy genre.

41,alindsay-al,A Fantastic film that hopefully is a new franchise,9,11 July 2020,"This film made its way to Netflix and I have now seen The Old Guard and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of immortal mercenaries fight to keep their identity secret when a new member is revealed.
Main Character
Charlize Theron plays the main character Andy here and I think she is fantastic here. If you have seen Atomic Blonde or Mad Max: Fury Road then you know she can pull off a great action role and she is no different here, she is awesome and totally believable in the action scenes making every fight that more intense. They also do a great job with her character, I thought she was really interesting and a certain thing they do with her character just helps boost her interest even more for me.
Supporting Characters
Newcomer Kiki Layne plays Nile, the newcomer to the group and I thought she was good too. She was also great in the action scenes and her and Theron had really good chemistry together here that makes there story really interesting. Every member of the immortals team is really good, they have interesting backstories and you are given interesting reasons to care about there characters and motivations. Chiwetel Ejiofor has a role here which wasn't as large as I initially expected but he does a good job here. His character has an interesting and well done motivation here I just maybe wish we could have seen him more as I think there was potential to do something even better with his character.
Story
The fact that these characters are immortal could have posed difficulties in its story telling but this film did a really good job, they show and explain enough of the backstories to keep you interested and intrigued without going overboard with it. The dynamic of the team is well done, and even though having a new member join the team is a trope I thought it worked well here. But my one issue here was the film has a weak main villain and his motivations are as generic as you can get which took away from the experience. But it isn't a huge issue as there is so much going on that is good here but it is an issue.
Script
The script is good, there is some nicely woven in humour here which helped build the friendship between the crew which made them better characters. Also surprisingly there is some really well done drama here that worked and made me care about the characters on the screen, I even think the cheesy dialogue is done well here.
Style
When looking at the style, the action is my priority and it is done fantastically. It is filmed so well, it is hard hitting, brutal and exciting. The fact that these characters are immortal allows the filmmakers to come up with some really unique action scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Overall
Overall, this might be one of the most surprising films I have seen in recent memory as I loved it, I can honestly say that I think this is the best film that Netflix has produced. If you are a fan of action films I think this is a must watch and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout and hopefully Netflix can make a franchise out of this as there is so much potential.",The Old Guard
42,henry8-3,The Old Guard,5,12 July 2020,"4 immortal soldiers lead by Theron are pursued by Ejifor who wants them for baddie Melling who is looking to create drugs and in turn lots of money, to help people live longer.An intriguing and fun idea with a number of enjoyable action sequences and a fair few plot twists. The main reason for watching this though is the presence of Theron who is the real star here. The downside here for such a superhero type project is the low budget - it looks a bit cheap sometimes like an episode of an action tv series from the seventies. There are also a few script problems with some of the monologues a bit crass and corny plus the flashbacks into history aren't of the quality needed - looked like them were filmed in a back garden.

44,yusufpiskin,Baklava...!!!,6,11 July 2020,"This movie is a masterpiece. Aside from its phenomenal fighting sequences and excellent characters' backgrounds, it is also written by the first-ever black woman director of a high-budget superhero film. I love every single minute of this movie, especially the cameo (and up-coming main character?) by Veronica Ngo (who was excellent in Furie, check it out if you haven't) and the tidbits of high-quality LGBTQ+ representation.As a queer myself, I was especially touched by how wonderful this movie handled the relationship between Joe and Nicky. It's understandable seeing how the author of the original comics is working side-by-side with the director, but what I want to talk about is that scene of Nicky and Joe in the armored van. I was genuinely touched by Joe's speech, and how their love had survived through decades of war and the worst of humanity.Onto the more lighthearted bits, I am impressed by how Charlize Theron had improved greatly in comparison to her previous action-packed movies such as Atomic Blonde and Mad Max. All the cast are brilliant, of course. I can't wait to see more of Kiki Layne as well.Speaking of representation, I can't thank Veronica Ngo enough for asking if they could accommodate her nationality into the movie. The character Quynh wasn't the same in the comics, but with her input, they made it so that she was Vietnamese and it made me feel so incredibly proud. Of course, my pride swells even bigger when I see her on my screen. She's simply just wonderful.All in all, I just want to say...Netflix: please make an immediate sequel for this movie.

Theron is an immortal, along w/3 others, who venture out into the world to right wrongs.

Theron directs her team to get to Ejiofor to get to the bottom of the hit but not before a new immortal (a young Marine cut down dead during a mission comes back to life when her wounds heal) presents herself. Now racing to save their lives & train a new, reluctant recruit becomes the film's running engine where the ending is never in doubt & the action, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love & Basketball/Beyond the Lights), is well shot & choreographed giving the actors enough room to strut their stuff. Adapted by Greg Rucka (Whiteout) from his own graphic novel, the story-line has a nice throwback to something like the Highlander series (not my cup of tea but others think of as gospel) w/o bogging the viewer down w/endless exposition & flights of fancy.

It's dark, gritty, and violent, yet not to the point of being overdone. I could do with a bit more character development, but to that end, what I really want is a sequel, or even a series, that lets us explore more of these characters, their heroics, and the ramifications of their deeds.The tweet I had seen that first alerted me to this movie, by Twitter user @MxHarryBentley, also stands in as a more succinct yet apt review than I could manage:""-Damn good action sequences

They haven't quite got it right In the past but with films like The Old Guard I they are definitely going in the right direction.This is the story of a soldier called Andy who leads a covert group of mercenaries who have an inability to die . They have fought to protect the world for centuries. The team is recruited to take on a mission and their abilities are suddenly exposed. Its up to Andy and Nile , the newest soldier to join their ranks, to help the group eliminate the threat of those who seek to replicate and monetize their power by any means necessaryI wasn't surprised to read that this is taken from a graphic novel. It definitely has that superhero feel about it .
It's a clever premise , if not totally original.
The action is great and the two hours flow by without dragging whatsoever.
Charlize Theron is perfect as Andy and it's good to see another female empowerment action film . They are becoming the norm now , so hopefully we can stop talking about it .This does feel like it's a start of a franchise or more likely a Netflix series .

This is a crew that has lived for hundreds of years, yet the script didn't really reflect that, and we relate to The Old Guard much as you would in any of a number of good-fighters-but-underdogs movies. Despite being an international adventure I found this movie just didn't capture that international panorama, and such panoramas are part of why I like such movies, as do even very old Bond movies. Maybe I'm being too harsh. I probably need to see it again.",The Old Guard
52,jadepietro,"Good Action, but Old Stuff",8,12 July 2020,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Everything old is new again in this superhero thriller that is action-packed but logic-empty.JIM'S REVIEW: It's Charlize Theron in action mode in The Old Guard, a sci-fi fantasy action thriller. She plays Andy, as in Andromache of Scythia, who happens to be an immortal....as in, the can't-die variety, who joins a group of similar mercenaries to save humanity. That little age-defying hiccup plays havoc with evil forces and the film's initial premise as well. It's Ageless Ninja Warriors (without the shell or references to artistic masters). All this hoopla proves it's tough being 3000 years old.The bad guy is a CEO pharmaceutical mogul named Merrick (a miscast Harry Melling) who want to steal their ""fountain of youth"" secret superhero powers from Andy and her gang of misfits which includes Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts), gay stud couple Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli). CIA agent Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor, in a throwaway role) hires the crew to go on a mission. Soon Niles (KiKi Layne) joins the crew and Andy becomes her mother figure as this newbie learns to harness her unwanted superpowers.Just as Andy's days seem long and endless, so does the film's multiple action scenes. (When you're centuries old, nothing much phases you.) Gory and ultra-violent, the film is one bloody fight after the next, with very little story in between. The flimsy excuse for a plot begins with rescuing kidnapped schoolchildren in Sudan, but it's just another pretense to kick ass. The screenplay is all too formulaic, even if it is written by Greg Rucka and based on his comic book series. (One has the feeling that this could become a profitable franchise depending on the audience's positive reaction to this fighting team, unless the Coronavirus wipes away that notion.)Director Gina Prince-Bythewood's first action feature is solid but standard action fare with some topical issues interlaced with all the bone-crushing, mind-numbing fights. She keeps the pace with some unexpected style and flair thrown in. As far as action goes, the film is intense and the stunts are well staged, especially all the well-choreographed hand-to-hand combat scenes. (Still, moviegoers may ask themselves: ""When your wounds heal, is there ever any real danger to our heroes despite some pain?"" How can they afford all the luxury cars and expensive gadgets? They may also want to question the decision-making and actions of this group of rogue warriors as little makes logical sense...even in the confines of the comic book supernatural universe. )The cast is convincing and in top physical form, although their acting abilities are rarely called to arms, even if their arms and other body parts do take a serious licking. To her credit, Ms. Palmer actually creates a vivid character that has some deep emotional range and the actress conveys her sense of trauma most effectively. The gay vibe between Mr. Kenzari and Mr. Marinelli is refreshingly welcomed and Mr. Schoenaerts pouts with authority. The talented Ms. Theron uses her screen persona well although this is familiar territory here, as she scored previously in two better examples of this genre, Action Blonde and Mad Max: Fury Road. Fans of this ilk should be satisfied. Even though, The Old Guard is old stuff, it is a well-made action movie that does its genre proud.",The Old Guard
53,Easygoer10,Better After Several Viewings,7,10 July 2020,"As no fan of people with ""superpowers"", I initially trashed this film. However, I watched it 2 more times. I was wrong; it grew on me. I found it entertaining. There were no huge surprises. In other words, I knew what was coming. As such, it is not particularly groundbreaking. All this noted, I enjoyed it. Besides Charlize Theron, I have liked Matthias Schoenaerts for years. He is very underrated. The rest of the cast is very good. Please note: If you like the premise of this film, I strongly suggest watching HBO Europe's Norwegian short series (6 episodes) ""Beforeigners"" (2019 - ). It is outstanding. It showcases Finnish actress Krista Kosonen. She has had numerous roles in Scandinavian TV and films. For American viewers, she was in ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017). ""Beforeigners"" is clever, mysterious, funny, thrilling and (overall) very entertaining. I would bet it is continued. If I was her agent, I would have found some more work for her in Hollywood. The rest of the cast is terrific. Last but not least, something I noticed long ago: Charlize Theron and Amanda Tapping (who is 10 years older) look very similar. This is easy to see if you look at side by side photos (when they were the same age). They have similar facial features and are both tall (same height: 5'9""). Amanda Tapping is an extremely talented (and wildly popular) TV actress, producer and director. She was in all of the ""Stargate"" (1994) spinoff TV Series. Primarily ""Stargate SG-1"" (10 seasons/All 220 episodes). Also ""Stargate Atlantis"" (1 of 5 seasons/Over 20 of 100 episodes), ""Stargate Universe"" (2 Seasons/Several of of 40 episodes). She had her own show ""Sanctuary"" (2008-2011) which ran 4 seasons (All 69 Episodes). It should be noted that ""Sanctuary"" was the very first TV series to exclusively use the new RED digital camera series. It captures images at 4 times the resolution of HD cameras. She directed several episodes, and since then has become a very talented (and prodigious) producer and director of many new TV series. Of course, Charlize Theron is an outstanding film actress. Her record speaks for itself. I particularly liked her in Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" (2012), along with many other films.",The Old Guard

What I mean is that the story and the characters should have developed with more background information. It's a pity cause it could have been so much better. There are many flows but at least the pace moves on a high level. I read many critics here. I cannot say it is entertaining and even to believe this is just a scifi-action doesn't justify to give it a chance.

[+61%],6,19 July 2020,"The Old Guard, at the end of its 2-hour run-time, feels like a film that could have been a lot more.Let me get to the BAD first.The irksome electro-pop soundtrack choices tremendously water down the action scenes.The connective tissue of the film i.e. the motivation (of the group of immortal mercenaries) behind doing what they do isn't talked about enough, until the very end.The storyline in itself is super predictable, with a one-note corporate bad guy.For about 40 minutes in the middle, the set-pieces are found wanting. It's supposed to be an actioner after all, yes? Not a drama/character study with plenty of expository dialogue. The director (Gina Prince-Bythewood) could have allowed the ""action"" to speak instead.Now, onto the GOOD.While the action sequences aren't ground-breaking, they're neatly done and sufficiently gory.Charlize Theron continues to kick ass and look dashing while at it.Chiwetel Ejiofor's character had more to him than I expected.A crappy twist is partially redeemed by the end of the film.Character diversity - both in terms of race and sexual orientation.",The Old Guard

62,Prashast_Singh,Another solid action flick by Netflix.,10,10 July 2020,"The Old Guard is in short a captivating, entertaining and memorable action film. It has all the action you want, along with some nice character moments in between that give everything a bigger purpose. Charlize Theron has to be appreciated for continuing to star in such intense action roles and delivering with finesse.Unlike other superhero movies, this one isn't vastly high on CGI (at least doesn't look like it is). The action is mostly practical (hand-to-hand combat, gunfights etc) and the pace is fast. The opening sequence itself is enough to confirm that. The cinematography is splendid, and the fight scenes are filmed mostly without excessive shaky camera movements due to which it's easier to understand, experience and enjoy them.I thought Extraction was the only cool summer action blockbuster Netflix had for us this year. Well, The Old Guard is another and fans of the genre would easily embrace it. This is why movies are made: just sit back, grab some snacks, turn off the lights and enjoy the ride.",The Old Guard
63,vithiet,"Great concept, great Charlize. The rest is a tad disappointing.",7,12 July 2020,"Part Highlander, part Underworld the concept for the movie was pretty interesting (but then again, all credits go to the original comics I guess). Charlize Theron is great as usual and if you just want to turn your brain off for 2 hours and enjoy some mindless stupid fun entertainment then this movie should do it for you. It's unfortunate there is nothing more to it than that. They're obviously building up a sequel/franchise but I'm afraid it might just go the way of the aforementioned Highlander and Underworld... off to a good start and then, you know, womp womp. Also, the music is absolutely terrible and doesn't fit the movie at all. I'd probably rate this a 6/10 but Charlize (yeah we're on a first name basis like that) makes it a 7.",The Old Guard
64,saptesh786,Army of immortals !,8,22 July 2020,Good action thriller. Starting with hostage drama rescue operation preparation but when in action it is a twist that takes you another twist that the army is immortal. We think the story is kind of different till first half ends. Some jolts you never expect in first half but later half is going very usual. Charlie Theron is perfect in her 'Andy's role. Here she looks like Ruby Rose in John Wick 2 and perhaps second time with black hair after firstly in ' Eion Flux'. Later half is less interested and predictable not any twist except last scene. I wish more sequels. Overall movie is enjoyable for action lovers especially who likes kick ass fights.,The Old Guard
65,thekarmicnomad,Wasted oppurtunity,6,10 January 2021,"This is a pretty good, action/fantasy movie.
It has some pacing issues but generally is pretty good if you fancy sitting back to watch minions get shot in the face for two hours.It is a shame though.
The immortality element could have led to some great action scenes.
But for some reason it was decided to make this film dumber than it needed to be.
The ridiculous antagonist has an endless stream of white men in Poundland body armour who have a penchant for running into bullets or standing around searching with both hands for their butt holes.
This is nothing new for action movies but this could have broken that mould but seemed to go out of its way not to.
The way Nile is recruited feels deliberately dumb and unrealistic.The weakest ink in the film though is Nile.
She is the most important character, as we are learning the world through her eyes, yet she is the most poorly written; apart from having a dead dad and a crucifix we have no idea who she is and Nikki Lane was not strong enough to lift the character.This would be a pretty good, cheesy action movie but it pauses too often to set up emotional threads that never pay off.",The Old Guard
66,bankofmarquis,Theron makes this watchable,7,22 July 2020,"In this time, where new cinematic experiences are limited to home viewing, it is fun to take a break from watching (or re-watching) classic films to check out a new movie.And this one, THE OLD GUARD, is a fun enough and well worth checking out.Starring Charlize Theron and based on a limited-run comics series from 2017, THE OLD GUARD tells the tale of a group if immortals (beings who cannot die) who bond together to serve the greater good of humanity.While the plot is rather ""by-the-book"": young, hip, ego-maniacal mega-industrialist uses nefarious methods to capture the immortals to use for his own (money making) purposes, the star power of Theron holds this piece together in interesting ways.Make no mistake - this is Theron's film (as the oldest of the immortals) and she is terrific. She demands attention anytime she is on the screen and when she shares the scene with strong actors like Chewitel Ejiofor(12 YEARS A SLAVE) and young Kiki Lane (IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK), it makes for an interesting film, indeed. Unfortunately, the rest of the Immortals (Luca Marinelli, Marwan Kenzari and - especially - Matthias Schoenaerts) are rather bland and the ""big bad"" (played by Dudley Dursley himself, Harry Melling) and his generic henchmen just aren't interesting enough.The Direction, by Gina-Prince Bythewood, and the fight choreography is professional, but nothing special, which adds to the ""meh"" I was feeling whenever Theron was not on the screen.But there is enough going right in this film that in this day where there is a dearth of new entertainment available, THE OLD GUARD fills the void quite well.Letter Grade: B7 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",The Old Guard

70,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"With a complex storyline, superb action sequences, and compelling acting, The Old Guard excels",9,14 August 2020,"Based on the comic book of the same name by Greg Rucka, The Old Guard takes place in the modern era where a team of immortal mercenaries led by Andy struggle to keep their identity a secret after their powers have been exposed after a new member joins them. Meanwhile, an organization seeks to replicate and monetize them for greedy purposes.Now, I have yet to read the comic book this film was based on, but upon discovering the entire premise and Charlize Theron starring in it, I gave this one a watch and to my surprise, it was better than I realized especially during the whole CO-VID 19 situation. It does leave you wanting to learn more about the side characters, but everything else is done very well.The story is not only complex, but perfectly well-written. The whole idea of immortal mercenaries fighting for a few centuries and fighting in the modern era is brilliantly executed and delivers some good drama and character depth. Not to mention it has some superb action sequences that are so well choreographed. The characters are also compelling especially Andy (even the LGBT portrayal is done very well) and the performances from everyone involved is great. Charlize Theron brought some intensity, poignancy, and pathos to her character and she shines with everyone else in the movie while Chiwetel Ejiofor as former CIA agent and Harry Melling as a weathly CEO brought some great support. The music score, while not one of the best I've heard, does it job especially the action sequences and the cinematography is visually stunning.Overall, The Old Guard is one of the best Netflix movies ever made. Now that it's been a month since it came out, there's a sequel in the works. To those who haven't seen the film, go check it out. It deserves a recommendation. :)",The Old Guard

Here she fights a lot but without emotion and too much focused on her than other characters are basically decoration. In a big action scene when everything focused in one character; the scene loses emotion, quality and truthfulness
She is the producer so everything is around her. There are to many dramatic scenes too few action scenes and not particularly good any of them.

74,msbreviews,The Old Guard starts an inevitable action saga with a pretty decent first installment.,6,13 July 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Netflix isn't exactly known for its original action films, and when these occasionally appear, most tend to be more comedic than focusing on the action itself (Spenser Confidential, 6 Underground). However, 2020 seems to be the year chosen by Netflix to surprise its viewers with ruthless, bloody, violent action. A few months ago, Extraction became the studio's best original action flick and one of the better movies ever released from the streaming network. Therefore, my expectations for The Old Guard were reasonably high, having in mind that it has Charlize Theron as the protagonist, and Greg Rucka as the sole screenwriter (he's one of the two creators of the original comics the film is based on).Overall, it's a pretty decent movie that could have been a lot better had it reached the potential that it possesses. First of all, any film that focuses more on starting a franchise than actually being a good movie sets itself up to fail miserably. Fortunately, even though Gina Prince-Bythewood's feature does establish saga-worthy lore, it never makes it its number one priority. In fact, until the penultimate shot of the film, I was genuinely worried that a certain storyline wasn't going to have closure due to the ""we need to save something for the sequel"" mentality...However, Greg Rucka clearly knows what he needed to write for the first installment of a possible franchise, and what he needed to save for the following chapters. The story is truly intriguing and mysterious, owning deep and complex mythology that doesn't have unambiguous answers. One of the aspects I love the most about Rucka's narrative is how it balances the abstract and philosophical approach to immortality. As weird as it might sound, immortality is depicted in such a believable manner even though everything about it feels unbelievably crazy.Even logically, all the questions one can have regarding ""how immortal can they be?"" are answered in some shape or form, so it's evident that Rucka wanted to make immortality something incredibly real and well-grounded. Charlize Theron's character gets her past very well-explored through flashbacks and a couple of captivating dialogues with her team. Andy is a tremendously easy character for the viewer to root for, and her ""badassery"" definitely helps strengthen that emotional connection.Kiki Layne is a major surprise for me, she delivers an impressive performance! I missed out on If Beale Street Could Talk, so this makes my first time watching her on the ""big screen"", and I can't' wait to see what she does next. Her character, Nile, is also quite interesting to learn about. She has to make extremely challenging life decisions for such a young woman, making her a candidate to steal Andy's spotlight in the following movies (which are undoubtedly happening).I wish that the screenplay packed less forced exposition, but I do understand the difficulties in explaining so many ""rules"" about this world without having a few dialogues exclusively meant to deliver that information. Rucka and Gina could have made better narrative decisions concerning a few storylines. Some sequences carry an immense potential that is never reached, leaving me wanting a bit more from a particular character or a specific subplot.The action is definitely above average, but it's far from the quality of Extraction, for example. Some action set pieces are really well-choreographed and well-edited (Terilyn A. Shropshire), but most employ the generic ""punch and cut quickly"" style. As nitpicky as it might be, for a rated-R film, the gunshots didn't have the visual and audible impact that they should have, being awkwardly unflashy throughout most of the runtime. In the end, the action is entertaining enough to make any viewer grab the popcorn bucket and eat everything.Nevertheless, two aspects heavily damage the film. The song selection is as cringe-worthy as it can be. I'm not entirely sure if the score composers (Volker Bertelmann, Dustin O'Halloran) are the ones to blame, but the excruciating insertion of an electropop song every ten minutes, including mid-action, ruins the dark, somber tone that the movie possesses, and it distracts from the actual fighting. The other aspect has to do with the ""villain"". I can't delve into details, but Gina and Rucka could have created a phenomenal antagonist whose moral motivations would resonate with every viewer, but instead, the ""I want money"" motive made the cut.All in all, The Old Guard continues Netflix's trend of original action films boasting riveting set pieces, even though it doesn't quite reach Extraction's level. Some sequences are indeed well-choreographed and well-edited, but most feel simply generic and *just* fun enough. As one of the creators of the original comics, Greg Rucka delivers a screenplay packed with intriguing lore, which is well-explored and well-established for (what should be) the first movie in a new franchise. With the remarkable direction of Gina Prince-Bythewood, the main focus goes to making a good film instead of trying to get in as much information as possible. Charlize Theron and KiKi Layne offer excellent performances as the two well-developed and emotionally compelling protagonists. However, the cringe-worthy use of electropop songs throughout the whole film damages many moments. For a story containing a moral dilemma at its center, the choice of a money-driven villain feels disappointing and extremely unfulfilling, having in mind the antagonist's potential. It's an entertaining action flick, no doubt about it... but it carried so much potential that it's a shame it didn't reach half of it.Rating: B-",The Old Guard
75,SoumikBanerjee25,Not Impressed!,5,15 August 2020,"Netflix's new original ""The Old Guard"" has this evergreen formula that is derived directly from many superhero/fantasy action films earlier but still fails big time on its promised deliverance. Mainly due to insufficient backing up from the writers' perspectives.
As out & out Action flick, this works!
On other aspects it simply doesn't.
Just flats out pretty quickly.
Due to incoherent writing and lack of much necessary depth; it just couldn't establish any sort of enmity between the good and the bad. Resulting an irrelevance factor that required immediate polishing.Performances are not that great either. Only Charlize Theron & Kiki Layne got the chance to stand out. Charlize's enigmatic presence and blistering action stunts make her case stronger on that point. Others were just pretty average and I seriously don't wanna have a conversation about the antagonist! My god! I so much hate bad Villains.Coming to the technicalities; cinematography and the overall production value looked solid as it's always been whenever Netlfix is behind the production line. The soundtrack is experimental but it did work in particular circumstances. Nothing extraordinary but above average for sure. Screenplay does suffer with some glaring issues. Especially when it wants to delve into dramatic aspects of the storyline. It just sags. And whenever the Action comes back kicking; it just replenishes all its energy Once again and rather rapidly!So to conclude my opinion; It was a promising concept on paper, but in actual execution falls flat on its face.",The Old Guard

This is why planning your scenes if so extremely important, and it's something that this director didn't do properly. Other plot holes are the fact that 'they' are so old, yet are stupid beyond belief and seemingly haven't built up any wealth to speak of at all.Other than those issues, it's your standard B-rate action movie... not as good as Mission Impossible Fallout, or John Wick 1,2 but not as bad as Bloodshot (2020) or Gemini Man (2019).

84,Stanlee107,Guarded,7,26 July 2020,This film is like being on a rollercoaster ride. As you aren't particularly bothered about the mechanics and physics of how the ride works (the plotline) & it is best to enjoy the ride (the action scenes) as it is. Charlie Theron plays the female lead and fights with the ferocity of John Wick with her fellow group of misfits. They are unique as they seemingly have an ability that many humans have longed for... Cue some wicked government agency has been assigned to find & capture them & discover their invaluable secret...,The Old Guard
85,trinaboice,Charlize Theron must be immortal to look like that and kick butt like that still,9,14 July 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, this superhero movie is based on the graphic novel The Old Guard: Force Multiplied 1 by Greg Rucka, which means this film WILL have sequels. In fact, at least one sequel is currently scheduled by Netflix and I'm glad to hear it because I was completely entertained by the story and would love to learn more about these characters.The screenplay was actually written by Greg Rucka, so the movie is really close to the source material. It's about some immortals that try to keep their existence a secret, while scientists try to find and exploit their powers. It's a really cool idea to gather warriors from different time periods.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of bloody, dead bodies
TONS of violence
Profanity, including F-bombs.
Two gay men kiss.
The comic books portray a lot of sex scenes with Andy, but they were taken out of the movie.
Modern and ancient weapons.THINGS I LIKED:
I love Charlize Theron. She's believable in every role and is a movie machine, pumping out two films per year since 2014. She read the graphic novel when she was shooting the movie Atomic Blonde and thought it should be made into a film, so she produced this. If you haven't seen that movie yet, you can click here to read my review of Atomic Blonde She does incredible stunt work and is gorgeous, as always. When is she going to start aging? Maybe she IS immortal.
The ensemble cast is great and includes Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, and Academy Award nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor.
You get to spend some time in Morocco, South Sudan, Afghanistan, Paris, and England.
The movie shows some pretty tough American women soldiers.
I always appreciate some humor, even in dramas.
The script tries to teach us a lot about each character so that we care about them. That's important since they can't die, so it would normally be hard to feel tension when they're in danger of their lives. We learn a little about their past, so we begin to care about them. I'm excited to learn more about them in the sequel.
The stunt work isn't groundbreaking, but it's still very good.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There's a lot of exposition, although I admit it's needed.
Some of the camera work is shaky because the scenes were shot from far away on zoom.
The rules of their immortal rejuvenation aren't super clear.
Some of the characters' motivations switch back and forth, which can be frustrating.
Some of the music choices were odd because lyrics would cut into a dramatic moment.
It would have been fun to exaggerate the differences between these immortals that highlighted the time they were from. That seemed like a missed opportunity. They all felt very modern.You can watch my full movie review on my Movie Review Mom Youtube channel and website.",The Old Guard
86,sbweightman,"Stylish and intelligently written, but formulaic in execution.",7,13 August 2020,"A stylish and intelligently written action thriller with good action scenes, great acting and good use of music. The plot takes a different view on the premise, but actually plays out in a rather formulaic way and loses its edge a bit in the second half.

88,ridi-arahan,"Immortality is a myth, don't you want to bust that?",8,14 July 2020,"What worked:
screenplay; the movie has beautiful scenes all motivated with a purpose and goal. One of the reasons action movies work is when there is a strong motive for the actions, and even more so when it is beautifully put in the narrative. It's a entertaining, fun movie. Extra point for the clever and unique concept.What did not work:
plot holes; there is no denying that the movie has some minor flaws which could have been taken care of with better production design and writing.Final verdict: recommended, we deserve at least one more movie sequel soon, and maybe even prequel. We never know considering the fresh and entertaining watch.",The Old Guard

The fight sequences were good, Charlize Theron makes a great action figure. Too bad the rest of the cast was not as good as she was. The real problem is the villain is just your standard, nothing interesting, compelling or different. This story needed a better protagonist than a corporate douche bag.

Now add a gay element, cliche dialogue and an ambiguous ending open for sequels. Throw in some unrealistic over the top action scenes and mix with more Woke culture.With a decent plot,a better dialogue and less in your face woke this could have been a really great film.",The Old Guard
94,PyroSikTh,Give Me More Background but Give Me Less Pop Music!,6,12 July 2020,"Immortality is no new concept to the world of movies, but it's a concept with massive potential that I'm really yet to see a movie fully achieve. The Old Guard is not that movie either, but goddamn did it come close. Andy, Booker, Joe, and Nicky have been waging their own secret war for centuries, fighting for what they believe is right, unknowingly steering the course of humanity as they go along. Unfortunately this movie focuses almost entirely on them in the present day. We get snippets of their history in brief flashbacks, but these are included more to build the characters than to add any real substance to the tantalising potential of the story's lore.Andy, or Andromache, is the oldest of the team, having been doing this for thousands of years. There was a time in her history, she claims, where she was worshipped as a literal goddess, but this point isn't really touched on at all. She's old enough to have lost other members of her team as well, including an unnamed member who just randomly lost his immortality, and Quynh who was sentenced to an eternity in an iron maiden under the sea (in blatant foreshadowing of a sequel), as well as completely lost her memory of her own age and her long-dead mother and sisters. Despite having seen the horrors humanity will stoop to over thousands of years, she somehow thinks these are the absolute worst times, and she's starting to lose faith in her mission. That is of course until the emergence of Nile, a new immortal, who reminds Andy what it felt to live, to leave family behind, and ultimately restore her faith in humankind.The other team members don't get nearly the same amount of attention, but there's certainly enough there for them to be more than just cartoon cutouts. Booker emerged in the Napoleonic wars, and is haunted by the untimely death of his youngest son of middle-aged cancer. He's lonely and tired, and all he wants is for it all to end, no matter the cost. But the most interesting members of the team, who deserve their own spin-off prequel, are Joe and Nicky, who both emerged during the crusades; Joe a Muslim and Nicky a European Christian. After years of killing each other over and over in the midst of their holy wars, they found a connection that transcends anything felt by any other human in history. In a moving and impassioned speech (and one of the movies greatest highlights), Joe describes the indescribable feelings he has for Nicky. They're not just gay lovers, they're soulmates in the most truest sense, destined through time and history to be together, and even after hundreds of years they've never grown tired or bored of each other. It's a beautiful sentiment.In truth there is actually quite a bit of good acting in this movie. A surprising amount, truth be told. Charlize Theron is of course as fantastic as she always is. This movie would've been a dull and forgettable affair without her leading the charge. Her complete badassery, her disdain for humanity, her fear of an eternity of torture, her regrets for those she's lost and left behind, every emotion and aspect of her character can be felt effortlessly through her performance. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a great performance as the guy who tracked them down and figured out who they were as well. While initially placed in the role of an antagonist, he manages to elevate the material to something deeper. After the long and painful loss of his wife, he's desperate for a solution to death, and I can't think of many actors who can take a typically antagonistic role like this and make their flip so believable and natural that you don't even question it. And of course Marwan Kenzari delivers that fantastic speech in the van with such conviction it brings an unmatched weight to his words.And then there's Harry Melling as Merrick, the young CEO of the pharmaceutical company, with dollar signs in his eyes. Merrick is a terrible pastiche, a moustache-twirler, a one-dimensional villain for our heroes to beat up and us not feel bad about it. Melling is perfectly suited to this role, because the poor guy just has a face easy to hate and despise. His weight loss just makes him look even more weasely and despicable. He just has to exist on screen and the villain role is fulfilled, which is exactly what he does in The Old Guard. But there was some real potential here for an interesting villain to throw uncertainty and an interesting dimension into the mix. He could've been a genuine altruist, like Copley, who thinks he's doing the best for humanity, creating a moral dilemma in the story. Instead he's just a greedy CEO who wants to get rich with no regards for the pain and suffering it would inflict.But the biggest insult to this movie is the soundtrack. The scoring is fine, if unremarkable and completely forgettable, but the licensed music is so ill-fitting for this movie. This is a story of immortal warriors who have been fighting for millennia, so of course the most obvious music choice is present day pop music? It's the kind of music you'd expect to hear in Riverdale or any other kind of CW show aimed squarely at preteens, in order to sound hip and cool. Instead it's going to make this movie seem so dated in 5/10/20 years. This is a timeless story about timeless warriors, but the music couldn't be more of this time if it tried. And it's so badly placed as well. It's like they picked songs that had lyrics that were vaguely relevant without any consideration for how the music actually sounds. Hip-Hop beats have no relevance to this story, slow emotional piano is misplaced over action sequences, and overly emotional and melodic female vocals over synthtracks is not timeless. Whoever was in charge of picking the music for this movie needs to go back to school and learn how to actually pick music appropriate to the movie.The Old Guard is a real mixed bag of a movie. There are some surprisingly great moments and enthralling performances for a relatively mindless action movie, the character work for most of the characters is great, there's lore and world-building just bubbling beneath the surface. But it's let down by it's one-dimensional villain, it's awful choice of licensed music, and it's predominantly present-day setting. Give me more flashbacks, give me more of this team and the trials and tribulations they've endured throughout the ages, give me a villain who does more than just twirl his non-existent moustache from beginning to end. Give me a story that spans the ages to really show the breadth of immortality! Give me a Joe and Nicky spin-off prequel! I give The Old Guard an enjoyably average 6/10.",The Old Guard
95,funtasticfour,"Highlander 2.0, or 2020",8,13 July 2020,"Highlander was a really fun movie in the 80's. I'm honestly surprised not many have used the concept of immortal humans more often. Charlize of course is perfect choice for such a movie, and the action is very good. The effects are pretty good too, but for me it's the lore and possibility of more that I love.

It's nothing exceptional, not too much deeper than a fun popcorn flick, but entertaining.The plot revolves around Charlize Theron and her band of immortal mercenaries, who stay off the grid but use their talents in magnanimous and altruistic ways. It was an enjoyable concept which has legs, and was well executed for the most part. The characters had some interesting development and were relatively well fleshed out, if never explored to a completely satisfying level. There were a few good twists which blindsided me, despite the ultimate end being relatively telegraphed. Overall a solid story which was entertaining if never amazing. The performances helped to execute the concept well, with Charlize Theron putting in an expectedly solid performance. There wasn't loads of content for the supporting cast to grapple with in terms of script or depth, but they were solid as well and provided good onscreen partnerships for Charlize.Really the main attraction of The Old Guard was the action, which was exciting, gritty, and well spread throughout the film. It had a good mix of gun fighting and hand to hard, some unique ish set pieces and an overall fun feel. Looking back though there wasn't anything particularly memorable about the action. It was fun as you were watching it but doesn't have the lasting impact of a John Wick 3 for example. There's also no defining set piece like Extraction or Atomic Blonde, which maybe this film could have done with.There's nothing spectacular about The Old Guard, but its fun and lively and a good way to spend a couple of hours.",The Old Guard

Woeful direction, TV heritage clearly, doesn't hold character focus, no understanding of the action genre. The dialogue is unfortunately comic book, some of it is truly silly. We're meant to believe that they are centuries old soldiers, but quite clearly have learnt no craft - walking across the brow of a hill, no camouflage gear, having old mediaeval weapons flapping about to catch on anything. As for the acting, well it's rotten, KiKi Layne is laughable in her role.

I am sick and tied of Charlize Theron boyish haircut that makes her even more unlikable than a missing limb and baldness her boyish hairstyle doesn't even suit her style it's better she has long hair or short hair from Atomic Blonde, in Fast 9 she has short Blonde hair she looks like wanna be Justin Bieber haircut type jeez would someone tell Charlize Theron to stop having Boyish haircut it doesn't even suit her. other characters in film Charlie group weren't interesting they were boring and character development is boring as hell. story follows Nile (KiKi Layne) who is American soldier got her throat slit by terrorist I am like why don't you look what terrorist has near him but no she is toonice with other people in Afghanistan she got slit you gotta be careful even if she is American Marine you never know who you run into when an your solider in Afghanistan. then somehow group of covert team of immortal mercenaries Andy (Charlize Theron), Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), Nicky (Luca Marinelli) centuries old warriors with regenerative healing abilities who use their vast experience to help people. they want their identity to kept a secret suddenly Nile who got recovered without any scratch she shares a disturbing dream with the other immortals Mercenaries, who are then alerted to her existence. how in earth shares unexpected dream to Immortals to group?

GIVE ME A BREAK action scenes were forgettable their weren't interesting or creative like people don't give praise on 6 underground that has so much creative action scenes it was insane it made to see film slaright away and right away that has characters that were rememberable and action as well the action and stunts were amazing and tons of crazy creative action like you never seen before, like with bright, Wheelman was crazy action in film and with Extraction was okay but I wasn't fan but least action was fun but not like crazy like with 6 underground. people are praising at wrong films like with this? when people praise on something write about action scenes what was good about it? what are action we never seen like with 6 underground I can compare action Netflix action like 6 Underground and with this people praise Extraction but hey I understand why but I never and never will understand why people praise this film and praised on action??? action never praised on me never it was forgettable just like with Marvel films.

""The Old Guard"" is one of those content and for a comic book supernatural action film, movie keeps its scale small to remain atypically attuned to its characters and the consequences of their actions. Unfortunately, it also follows the 1990's action movies, while its lack of character empathy, development and emotional investment to fully enjoy the entire film, which ranks ""The Old Guard"" somewhere in the lower echelons of based on graphic novel movies which is disappointing.

Led by Charlize Theron's Andromache the Scythian (her friends call her Andy) who could have even lived as far back as the ancient Macedonians, strives to keep her powers and the powers of their team strictly their own. Just that bit of plotting alone works for the film, it's entertaining fast paced action sequences that clearly comes from Theron's training as Atomic Blonde, and she kicks ass, literally. The fight sequences are incredibly filmed. Unfortunately the film is brought down by its conventions into other genres making it feel a bit restricted, but thankfully director Gina Prince-Bythewood brings a sophisticated and we'll made vision into the superhero genre and Theron is yet again brilliant in the fight scenes.

105,W011y4m5,???,7,19 July 2020,"Found this to be pretty decent until one noticeable plot hole nearly smacked me straight in the face with its unexpected arrival.
Why on earth would a man who understands the purpose of immortals interfere with their existence - when it's clear that by doing so, he could inadvertently jeopardise the beneficial symbiotic relationship they have with the mere mortals around them? It doesn't make sense & we're never provided with any coherent explanation as an answer for this glaringly obvious question.
""Blah blah blah scientific endeavour / for the greater good of humanity"" etc. The usual clichéd motivations spouted by ""those in the pursuit of knowledge"". We get it as it's not exactly original BUT if specific aforementioned clever person has already discovered that those immortals are immortal for the purpose of averting unforseen catastrophes in the future & have been solely responsible for preventing mass suffering throughout history (which only proves this theory correct beforehand) & they're unknowingly being kept alive by a greater power in order to preserve the predetermined course of time through their personal actions & choices - then WHY the hell does he of all people (when he is already conscious of this information) set them up at the beginning?
It's this illogical, incoherent, inexplicable characterisation of Chiwetel Ejiofor's Copley - as this well intentioned operative who simply wants to help others by unlocking the protagonist's powers - even though he's already aware of the fact that by simply breathing, at some point in the future, they are already somehow helping humanity - that immediately distracts the audience with its nonsensical hypocrisy.
Thus, this blatant contradiction of motivations couldn't help but pull me right out of the story from that point onwards because as soon as we learned this, it immediately screwed with the logic of the entire narrative - considering the events which unfolded began with this supposedly well-intentioned man behaving in a way which would deliberately result in something negative... So his intentions weren't well & as a consequence, he cannot possibly be well-intentioned!?",The Old Guard

107,DeBBss,Pretty Tasteless,5,12 July 2020,"The Old Guard is a movie that takes heavy influence from plenty of great movies, and it really tries to imitate such films. The Old Guard reminds me of John Wick's action/fight scenes, but it will never be as memorable as John Wick. And I think that's the greatest flaw of the film; The Old Guard will not be as memorable or stand out as much when compared to other movies of the same genre. The plot and characters are all pretty standard, and they all have some cliched personality.The screenplay played it very safe. It's all very predictable and it doesn't add anything new to the table. There was so much potential in this movie solely because of its plot, but there was no creativity and it lacked taste. At least the plot wasn't completely bad; the pacing was fairly well done, and the subplots were decent with little plot holes. It just sucks how this movie felt so unenthusiastic when it had such great potential.The characters were okay, but incredibly cliched. I can't count how many times I've seen a main protagonist like Andy; there's nothing really special about her. And I understand that Andy is supposed to have a withdrawn personality, but she was just super bland. Ironically, the character that was the most interesting was Quynh, who had two scenes dedicated to her (not including the final scene). When it comes to the antagonist, he's just as boring as all the other characters. The antagonist (Merrick) is an evil capitalist who uses the ""I'm trying to help the people"" excuse to make money. There's as many Merrick antagonists as there are Andy protagonists, which isn't a good thing at all.The Old Guard is as average as it gets. Honestly, movies such as The Old Guard are not worth watching, because eventually they're going to be forgotten way too quickly. The Old Guard isn't a bad movie though, it's just super tasteless and uninteresting.",The Old Guard

Starring: Charleze Theron, Kiki Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Chiwetel Ejiofer, Harry Melling etcOverall rating 97/100The old guard follows a group of immortal soldiers, who are suddenly exposed and hunted for their powers, they must fight to keep their identity hidden, whilst also contending with a new member to the group. Wow the old guard was one of the best action movies I have seen, so many good things to talk about. So let's get started.First of all, there was an interesting concept, great action sequences and great cinematography and set pieces. The concept itself, despite being explored before, was done in a different enough way that it still felt fresh and new, the film explored it's premise well, and the world building around the concept was fantastic as well, making for a more investing film and story world. Next, the action sequences were fantastic, the film's creativity with it's action with the powers of the characters made for very entertaining sequences that was equally split between all the characters to show off their skills. The cinematography of the film was fantastic which added to the creativity of the action sequences, the set pieces were fantastic and fitted the tone of the movie, with many exotic and creative places perfect for the artistry for the cinematography as well as the action sequences.
Next the main character was likeable, the main performance was great, and there were some unique character perspectives. The performance from Charlize Theron was fantastic, she suits these types of roles in action movies perfectly, her attitude and action sequences were fantastic, and she was a very likeable main character that you could instantly like and connect to. Her character also had a really interesting and unique character perspective towards immortality, the fact that she actually wanted to have a normal life and was tired of coming back to life all the time, was really interesting and well explored, this was a different personality trait for somebody with immortality or superhuman powers and I thought it was very interesting.My next few positives is the connection to the characters, the chemistry between them and the LGBTQ representation. The film did a really good job at making you connect to all the characters, which is fairly rare within an action movie, they weren't just immortals with powers, they actually had a life before their current jobs, and seeing the lifes that they have to leave behind because of there powers made you connect to the characters a lot more then what I was expecting, the chemistry between all the characters was also great, I genuinely believed all the relationships within the group of characters, you could tell they had all been with each other for many years, due to their chemistry within the action sequences and the witty dialogue shared between everyone. I also really enjoyed the LGBTQ representation within the film, for so long in action movies, there has either been no representation, or teasing which is not good enough. So I am glad that they had two openly gay characters, expressing their love for another, and it was normal to the other characters this needs to be the way forward for representation of this community that needs more roles in movies.Next there was clever links between the characters, great development, emotional weight and interesting powers. I thought the links between the new character played by Kiki Layne and the rest of the gang was really well done, as soon as Nile recovered from what should have been her death, she was instantly connected to the all the other immortals, highlighting the connection between everyone, I just thought it was a great way for all the characters to become a team. The film had great character development that really made you understand the pain the characters were going through especially with Charlize Theron, as you learned how long she has lived, and how many lives she has saved, as well as her past friendships and connections she made, it really made you understand her character a lot more and why she acted like she did. The film did also have a fair amount of emotional weight in terms of the idea of immortality, the thought of having to leave your family behind, due to them growing old and you staying the same age or looking the same, was really thoughtful and made you sympathise with the characters, due to them having to sacrifice so much. There powers were also really interesting, the whole concept, of no matter what happens you can heal was really interesting and used though multiple different scenarios throughout the movie, I also liked the fact that the characters didn't know when they would stop healing, which also shows how much they were willing to sacrifice in order to save other people.My one slight negative about the movie would be that it did have some generic genre conventions. It did follow the action convention of a rookie/protégé being taught the ropes by the main character, so it would have been nice if they had found a way around not having some slightly generic moments, but it wasn't to much of an issue for me.My final few positives would be the villains, the amount of time spent with all the characters, the plot twists, and the final act. I found the villains largely leaded by Harry Melling to be really well thought out, there intentions of finding cures for diseases such as Alzheimer's and cancer were great at first as it's linked to today's society, but how they hunted down Charlize Theron and the whole crew was wrong, but these types of villains, if pulled off well which in this case they were, are great. I also loved the amount of time spent on all of the characters, the film did a great job with making you connect with each and every character, and surprisingly to do this they actually gave everyone and equal amount of development and screen time which was a pleasant surprise. And finally, the final act and the plot twists involved within it, were entertaining well executed and left me very satisfied with the film, the sequel tease was also exciting.Overall the old guard is one of the best action movies I have seen, taking a previously used concept, yet making it seem fresh and new, let's hope the sequel can live up to this movies greatness.",The Old Guard
110,yankeedoo,Ok but,8,10 July 2020,Needs more action and more back story told too but not bad for a fri night,The Old Guard
111,januszlvii,I did not like it,2,13 July 2020,"I flat out disliked this movie. I cannot say I hated it ( those movies ( like Machete or Paradise Hills hey one or no stars from me instead of two. But there is not one character I cared about ( liked or hated). Charlize Theron ( Andy) was about as ugly as Rachael Maddow and the black girl did absolutely nothing. I am wits end about how many movies show the pharmaceutical companies as bad guys, and women who are super powered. give me a break, I save seen that done that before and better ( see Resident Evil).,There was also a lack of humor or even clever dialogue ( something badly needed to show the characters are not robots). Did I forget to mention no surprises like say Atomic Blonde? I will say it had a few good action scenes ( especially at the end), but as far as an action film it is strictly bottom of the barrel. I give it 2/10",The Old Guard
112,flingebunt,Dull and predictable story,5,25 October 2020,"A group of superheroes are pursued by a shadowy organisation with the goal of harnessing their secrets: Only this time the power is healing, 'immortality' and being emo about it. This has been done countless times before, and this Highlander meets X-men plot line is a yawn a minute that manages to drag itself up a little with good acting and gritty fight scenes. The problem with this plot is that it is straightforward. Surely out of the 15 graphic novels this movie is based on, there must have been one or two stories a bit better than this.",The Old Guard
113,faer_kr,Safety pin,10,11 July 2020,"An adventure film with action.
It is about an immortal squad that is caught in a trap and when they get up they decide to go after their attacker, while a new girl joins them, trying to be sold as laboratory rats.
At first it is parsimonious and confusing but after the ambush it stands out.
Charlize Theron is spectacular as always.
With LGBTQ elements.
Spectacular
Quality.
Entertaining
The soundtrack is adequate.
The stunts are extremely well executed.
The bullets and action scenes very well managed and cared for.
The last action scene of the third act is amazing.
One ignores the fantasy elements of how excellent the movie is.
The only problem is that it does not reveal the reason for immortality.
Leave a window for the sequel.
Safety pin",The Old Guard
114,Rendanlovell,Jarring,3,15 July 2020,"This movie is a structural nightmare. Every plot beat, especially in the first half seems to come out of place. Before we see who any one is we already have the inciting incident. We learn that Charlize Theron and her team of spy guys are invincible in literally the first 10 minutes. We see a scene of the band getting together, a man hiring them, and a fight scene all before we know Charlize Therons character name. Who isn't even the main character. The main character is a new immortal marine lady that we don't see until after we know who the villain of the film is. Wouldn't it make more sense to open the film showing the sting operation where this marine lady gets killed? It would actually be an exciting, jarring opening to your film. You'd be introduced to the main character right away, and you'd learn about this super power all in one go. Then you can have Charlize Theron save her and take her back to the others in her group. You'd learn about the world, these people, and the immortals through the eyes of the main character. Since she has no idea what's going on she could be the audience surrogate, but we already know everything about everything before we even meet her. It's incredibly bizarre. All you'd need to make this set up work is tweak a few things or send the script through another draft. This structure isn't new or interesting by any means, but it's better then this jarring, jumpy mess of an opening. After this, the film gets really bland and generic. The dialogue is incredibly on the nose, to the point of it being laughable. They overexplain elements that absolutely do not matter, then undercook things that could be clever. I wouldn't say it's an unpleasant watch but it borders on being one. There's really nothing more to say. The performances are fine and there are a few fun action sequences but the film is hamstrung by its lack of clarity and creativity. The constant barrage of edm music and uninspired direction does not help either. Motivations for characters doing what they are doing is not that clear. The villains want to make money off an anti aging idea, which is fine. The immortal characters though, are a different matter. The only reason they are doing what they're doing is because they want to do good? These characters have lived for hundreds and hundreds of years but instead of doing something interesting they just play as spies. It's an incredibly uncreative, uninteresting execution of a great concept.",The Old Guard
115,mike-c-b,Unlikeable characters whisper-panicking,1,21 July 2020,"Every characters is exactly the same... panicky, whispering, insecure. Everyone acts tough, doesn't breathe. Unlikeable/unfollowable characters.",The Old Guard
116,Brooklynsmagicmike,Alot better then I expected to be honest.,8,12 July 2020,This movie was another one of netflixs heavily promoted big budget films. The reviews were very high and the cast was great so I decided to check it out. Its comparable almost to Wolverine in many ways. The action was excellent and the visuals were off the charts. Pacing was great as well and I felt the acting was believeble/lines were good.My only complaints would be that the soundtrack diddn't fit with the movie at all. Also it could of used a little humor it took itself way to seriously.I would definitely recommend it nonetheless. Its enjoyable and a good time overall.,The Old Guard
117,joeyford-55342,HIGHLANDER lite,7,10 July 2020,"Good flick. Well paced. Starts fast and ends fast. Interesting twist here and there. One was silly, you'll see it. And Netflix so they ignore the WHO one-percent rule and give half the crew jazz hands. It is no ATOMIC BLONDE or REINDEER GAMES but Theron does a good job with action. They set it up for a sequel, I'll catch it. Watch this!",The Old Guard
118,efd-10467,Okay but has moments that drag,7,10 July 2020,"The acting in this is quite good, in particular Charlize Theron overdoes the tough loner attitude.Some good action but with long periods of plot stall in which they do some character development, but again you feel a bit claustrophobic in the sets and backgrounds, very TV in fact very 90's TV, the viewer sees through the production techniques aimed at trying to present a big world canvas on a suburban lot.It's highlander with less mysticism and a stereo typical villain, but overall a good attempt in hard times, watchable but probably not memorable.",The Old Guard
119,elliotte2,Watch for action only.....nothing else,4,12 July 2020,"This had so much potential......but...Take away the 'immortality' and the movie felt like a run of the mill secretive behind the scenes mercenary film of which several that have come out in the past twelve months.There are suspension of belief and then they are just stupidity.1.Multi-billion dollar pharma research building with security that is barely better than my Ring doorbell.2.Over 1,000 rounds of bullets flying in downtown London and not a single police or even a single person walking down the street?3. The 'twist' at the ending was stupid, because if the twist was real, movie would have stopped after one hour, meaning the writers wrote the twist at the end, without redoing the previous part of the movie to even make the twist believable.4. The writing is painful, not the acting, the writing. If felt like something at a high school level.5. I was debating on 4 or 5 stars, but would I watch again? No. Will I watch the apparent sequel that is coming, no.",The Old Guard
120,rehmankhilji,Very Good,7,13 July 2020,"Finally, in this lock down of the world, something worth watching. A good movie after a very long time. Yes, perhaps in general days, might have something to add for not liking it, but for now, just enjoyed it thoroughly.
Charlize Theron, well she just is a superb actress and getting younger / stronger each year.
Must watch, cause there is nothing else to be honest.",The Old Guard
121,johnsmithjanuary-20081,all good except the soundtrack,9,9 September 2021,Really was a good movie aside from the generic current pop songs they used for the musical soundtrack. Good action flick though.,The Old Guard
122,byron-116,Unbelievable as the story is....,6,11 July 2020,.... you accept it There's very good choreography action. Very watchable and entertaining. I predict that we will have a sequel,The Old Guard
123,gareth-75442,MEH!! Barely kept my eyes open,3,12 July 2020,"The old guard comic is boring the movie is no different, the Highlander movies did all this much better, the photos dotted about of past events were more interesting than the movie itself.
Bland, boring dreadful rubbish, their only ability was to die then come back to life, dreadful.",The Old Guard
124,jackgdemoss,Really solid action and room for intrigue,8,29 August 2020,"It is hard to really complain about The Old Guard. The action is exciting and well shot. The acting is solid. It drips with intrigue and covers all of its plot holes. I suppose the only way it could greatly improve is by raising the stakes, which is difficult given the premise of the protagonists abilities. They leave room for a sequel and I look forward to it. Great watch for a straight to Netflix.",The Old Guard
125,ariqakbar,Whatsup about the soundtrack?,7,13 July 2020,"Good story phase, they do background and present part in good portion. i know there's some part that feels being forced so the main event can suit to the grand storyline. There's part that feels intentionally to make the story unpredictable but sacrifice the whole story value. and there's the vice versa scene of that too.little stiff in the action part, but they have a really fresh 'move' tho.For me, the problem was the soundtrack. they really put unfit song/sounds in the soundtrack. Can't really know the good side in it. could be 8 if its wasn't because the soundtrack.",The Old Guard
126,Nemesis42,Impressive.,10,10 July 2020,"This is a very thoughtful film. While it includes the expected sequences of powerful combat, which are highly impressive, it also explores the condition of immortality with satisfying philosophical clout.All performances are strong, and successful teamwork from the filmmaking crew shines through. The script develops the characters well and the casting is top notch.
Innovate soundtrack, with songs selections and score.To top it off, the epilogue and end credit montage supplement the story so satisfyingly. This could easily continue into part two :)",The Old Guard
127,carlos37andre,"I love the mythology, but the shameless set up at the end is frustrating",7,1 August 2020,"I don't think there is much to say, I love the mythology they've built, I like the main characters enough at first, and after a while they developed most of them pretty ok. I like the whole mystery behind Andy's past, and the fact that she would be so old, she couldn't even remember how old (which makes sense, she may have been born in a time where there wasn't even the concept of years, or age).I like the whole approach they have on immortality, that been more of a curse, than a blessing. I hate some characters, like Booker, after the betrayal, and even Copley. But I think that was the point. And, of course, the main villain is just an egomaniac corporative jerk, cause... reasons. I hated him, which again, I thought was the point of the character, but he is just the cliché cartoon villain, who is bad for the sake of been bad.Having Nile, as the newcomer, and the plot device that help us (the audience) understand the whole world we are in is also a good idea. And once again, I just like the world they built.Also, the action is great. I like the directing, the script keeps you grabbed all the time, giving us hints of the story for most of it, not giving it all up just at once. Is a good story.I just hated the last minutes of it. You didn't have to set up their new group of superheroes (or whatever that is), and most of all, they didn't have to have Booker meeting Quynh at the end. Don't get me wrong, if the movie had ended with Andy saying goodbye to Booker, they could make a sequel just fine, we didn't need to have the sequel thrown at our faces at the end. We got it, Netflix, you could build a franchise out of this, we aren't stupid. Anyways, it just bothers me, that they couldn't just finish the movie without the obligatory opening to a sequel.The soundtrack is... weird. I didn't think the pop songs fit the style of it all.At the end, The Old Guard is a good movie, it has a lot of potential, and I liked the world they built, there were just a few mistakes along the way, who are the reason the movie doesn't reach its true potential.",The Old Guard
128,Eddie_weinbauer,Quite boring and pointless,1,11 July 2020,"Lets be abundantly clear. This movie is sold on charlize Theron,make no doubt a bout it.
Why though I have no idea cause she really isn't all that.The biggest problem I have with it,is the pace.It's to slow for being a good action movie. And you don't sympathize with any of he characters. They actually bore you to death.
Another thing. They suppose to be hunting someone who is hunting them,but they're not really putting an effort into it. Yet he has no problem finding them. over an over.",The Old Guard
129,MarcoParzivalRocha,Missed Opportunity,5,4 August 2020,"A group of immortal warriors faces the greatest threat they have ever encountered. Another comic book adaptation made by Netflix. I'm a fan of the creator (Greg Rucka), but I haven't had a chance to read the GN yet. The premise is interesting, and I think that a tv show woukd be more interesting rather than a film, with more time to explore and develop the narrative. Inevitably it comes to a place where typical clichés come into play, such as exaggerated dramas, worn-out dialogues or tired action scenes, where only the characters change, with everything else being the same in all blockbuster films. The cast is the strongest point, with very solid interpretations of the main characters. Also, the soundtrack is horrible, in my opinion.",The Old Guard
130,drunken_munki,"Played too straight, and boring for me",4,22 July 2020,"The Old Guard is a strange combination of comic book and modern realism that just doesn't click right. I'm not sure why a movie like this turns up from time to time and the same mistakes are seemingly made. This combination with no risks taken always ends up making a bland movie.Since this is heavily inspired by Highlander (I guess?) it is good to compare them. Highlander had a more upbeat plot with quirky characters and had a flare to play around with the immortal human theme. To kind of emphasize it. In the Old Guard it felt the characters were very boring, always scared, and needlessly complaining.In addition the writing is done in such a way that it is very muted and plodding. A tighter script and something to move the super heroes along faster would have been good here.As it stands I didn't really like this film, but there may be something in it for different folks; I gave it 4/10 and would probably never watch it again.",The Old Guard
131,nidhunmoviebuff,"Charlize Theron finally lands a sequel-worthy, lead superhero role she has long deserved!",7,28 July 2020,"#LateReview #TheOldGuard #Netflix #CharlizeTheron #Hollywood #SpoilerFreeI was a bit late to the party on this on. Charlize Theron in 'The Old Guard' finally gets the uber-badass sequel-worthy lead role she has long deserved since her captivating performances in Mad Max Fury Road and the Atomic Blonde.Another Netflix film that shines with its action choreography after Extraction, The Old Guard follows the journey of a group of ancient immortals intervening in select events they feel might tilt the balance of power on a global scale.Director Gina Prince-Bythewood takes care to chalk out each character with enough shades of black and white and ably leverages a performer of Theron''s caliber. The leading lady is in terrific form, performing her stunt sequences with elan and commanding authority effortlessly among a commando group largely composed of men.Highly recommended for fans of the action-thriller genre and an absolute must-watch for people who grew up admiring Theron's tour de force performance in Monster (2003). Felt that Chiwetel Ejiofor is under-utilized but with a sequel likely on the cards, expecting a bigger role for him in the next installment.Looking forward to more from this intriguing, brilliantly crafted Universe!",The Old Guard
132,kenzibit,Excellent 👌,9,10 July 2020,Great movie and great acting with an awesome concept. Charlize being one of my favorite female actors made me enjoy this a lot not forgetting the awesome fight scenes. Really hoping for a sequel after seeing the last part before the cutscenes.,The Old Guard
133,Ashitaka137,Decent movie but,6,17 July 2020,It could have been a lot better with a better script; good cast though. But i agree with Chiwetel Ejiofor's character(James Copley) perspective; and those people had almost eternal life and they chose to spend it killing for money.,The Old Guard

135,faithless4734,somewhat predictable,6,13 July 2020,"First and foremost the character Nile was bad, as in not well written and extremely predictable. Having been a Marine I can tell you the tactics at the start were laughable, I can also tell you that the little Lcpl that Nile was would not have been doing the job she was if she was so ""highly"" trained in hand to hand combat. You also have a touch of Highlander in this movie. They have switched it up some, not in a good way, but you can see the influence. The writing of this movie was poorly done there are so many holes in this story and obvious skip overs on how they went from point A to point C.",The Old Guard
136,krzysiektom,Meh,3,12 July 2020,"Disappointing. Looks like a lazy film made for TV, aiming mostly at a teenage audience. Not even a scratch on Atomic Blonde and Mad Max, two others Charlize's action films, which are in a different league to this mediocrity.",The Old Guard
137,staunton-gary,No too bad,7,7 August 2020,"I enjoyed the movie, I was entertained, that's the point of a movie. If you want to be entertained and not bother too much about the cliches, or top notch script, definitely give this movie a watch.",The Old Guard

Has some good action and Charlize is fantastic as always but there's still some plot holes and the music choice is really bad, it's not god awful Suicide Squad level of random songs playing in the middle of the movie, but it's not good either and they should pay some composer to make them some good soundtrack and themes instead of buying these songs that don't fit the tone of the scene and the movie.",The Old Guard

Nope, not really.
Stay with me please.Yes, folks are tripping over themselves to smooch the feet of Charlize Theron, and though that would not be a dilemma if ever the opportunity arose, there is more, much more worthy viewings in this actor's cannon.Yes, ""The Old Guard"" ticks off a lot of the inclusivity possibilities long ignored by Hollywood, but just past the feel good political correctness lurks a very mundane comic book action movie. And folks, those are really not cinema, just silly escapism fluff, the fast food of the big screen, and should be categorized as such. Just ask Martin Scorsese.Yes, this film has plenty of kickass hand to hand fights to satiate that demographic, but when the heroes are immortal, is there really any suspense in the combat, and the inevitable story line?Yes, there's a bit of kryptonite leaking into the picture to try and throw a wee bit of a curve into the plot, but c'mon, who are we kidding? This is a hero action movie.Yes, everything here is perfectly staged, orchestrated, and manipulated to the Nth degree, but it feels one dimensional, just like a, er, comic book. Any attempts at empathy and character depth seem way out of place, and little more than place holders till the next battle scene roars to life.Yes, some folks really, and I mean really like this sorta thing, and they will enjoy the ride. And some folks are a bit tired of easy bake movies, no matter how good the intention. Disappointing when a woke movie induces sleep.hipCRANK",The Old Guard

141,rdamian1963,Better than Average,7,21 September 2020,I had somewhat higher hopes for this movie but it was better than average. It has a solid cast with decent acting throughout the movie. The action sequences were well done. The villain is stereotypical. The script was more befitting of a TV movie. So many reviewers disliked the soundtrack. It gave a different feel to the movie than anticipated but I can't say it hurt the movie. The Old Guard may have benefitted as being set up as a series instead of a movie. The ending certainly allows itself for a sequel. Overall it is worth the watch.,The Old Guard

Improved throughout, ending's okay. Also only makes sense if Andy somehow gets immortality back. Watched it, though, would watch a sequel. Needs some more distancing from its comic book roots. Also, the music... puhleeeeze. I was encouraged by the largely adult cast (and the kid wasn't bad - that's not it). It's a great idea, but it needs some polishing, if it wants to be taken even as seriously as the Transporter series, for example.

If good taste an common sense prevails, this sequel of course will thankfully never happen.Would give this a -5, but that is impossible and seeing as and effort to quantify this either as a 1 or a 10 would be more thought and effort than went into this utterly mundane plot, which is not worth it, so a mediocre 5 it is.",The Old Guard
145,repojack,Fun,7,9 January 2021,"Netflix dropped a bunch of big budget action movies in 2020 (and thank God for that given this endless pandemic).Headliners included Chris Hemsworth (Extraction), Ryan Reynolds (6 Underground), and Charlize Theron (The Old Guard),... which, was a blast. The first act was excellent. One of those action flicks with very specific, memorable, and rewatchable scenes. The Matrix is the standard-bearer of that kind of movie.While (The Old Guard) doesn't get anywhere near the level of The Matrix (slows down and meanders a lot in the middle and last act), it's an entertaining ride and I wouldn't be upset at all if they made a sequel.",The Old Guard
146,snowfre,The premise is not explored to a satisfying extent,6,11 August 2020,"Charlize Theron stars in this comic book adaption, that has a captivating story that quite early on, unfortunately, is pushed aside in favor of action sequences. From here, the story goes a pretty straightforward direction with only a few surprises, and if it weren't for the entertainment value, ""The Old Guard"" would have a tough time keeping the audience interested. It's obvious that Netflix has (or had) plans making a sequel to this film, but I'm not sure that, despite Theron's acting - one of the highlights, many people would actually desire such a continuation.",The Old Guard
147,gcsman,"A very watchable actioner, and would have been just fine on the big screen too.",6,18 July 2020,"Finally something new to review during covid19 quarantine. I'd have happily seen this decent action film in the theater -- it's not deep; what you see is what you get. But it's got good production values, a perfectly fine cast, and a good concept to hang the story on. The big-name lead is Charlize Theron, who's built her action cred with previous outings in Aeon Flux, Hancock, Fury Road, and Atomic Blonde (all of which are worth re-watching). By now she's got her action choreography moves down very smoothly to the point where she looks almost magisterial in the obligatory fight scenes. Combined with her acting skills and commanding physical presence, she's an absolute force on screen. And with her signature cold stare and body posture, the lead role of Andromache, the hard-bitten, fatalistic millenia-old warrior, fits her very well.If this were just a bunch of fight scenes loosely strung together, I'd rate it a lot lower, but the main hook for the storyline is compelling enough to distinguish it. A small band of immortal warriors (our heroes) with just one superpower -- a rapid healing factor -- wend their way through history as mercenaries trying to carry out secret missions for good. On the surface it's a cross between Ryan Reynolds' recent thriller ""6 Underground"" (in which the action heroes have faked their own deaths to continue operating in secret), and Wolverine (or in fact Ryan Reynolds again, with Deadpool). But in these kinds of movies it's all in how well it's carried off. The Old Guard gets good marks for that.The rest of the international cast are much less well known in North America but they hold their own. Kiki Layne, as the new recruit to the Old Guard, has a good stride and good moves. (I actually mean that literally. A convincing action hero has to be able to move well and confidently.) Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, and Luca Marinelli are the other Guard members and all do well. The protean Chiwetel Ejiofor, who seems to be everywhere, does his usual trick of keeping us guessing about what his character is really up to. The only false note here is Harry Melling's part as a cardboard-cutout villain -- a slimy, completely amoral bio-corporate overlord who wants the Guard members for their genes and the chance to make tons of money. We know he's going to meet his doom in the end and it's only a question of how. Giving him any kind of texture or nuance would have been an improvement.This movie is obviously set up for potential sequels. It's getting decent press, but we'll see.",The Old Guard

And I would highly recommend that you get the Graphic Novel afterwards.",The Old Guard

152,Golden_Hope,A Slowish and Plain Action Movie,4,10 July 2020,"I kinda went into this expecting it to be like a ""popcorn, action summer"" movie but I found it really boring.It moves at such a sluggish pace for the first hour then it kinda picks up its pace but by then you don't really care.That is another big issue is that the characters are very paper thin for the most part. Its main take no nonsense lady, man, man, man and new girl. They are complete characters descriptions of the main cast. Charlize's characters is more developed with a deeper backstory but the others are so interchangeable and forgettable.The action scenes are well choreographed but I found the sound effects a bit too much like every time a sword or axe was used it would make a cartoon ""swoosh"" sound which I get it but I think it could have been tone down a little bit.It's not like terrible and you could probably watch it if you are really board but I wouldn't carve out 2 hours to watch it.Oh yeah it's 2 hours 5 minutes long which is too long and definitely has scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor to tighten it up.",The Old Guard
153,eelen-seth,One of the best comic book adaptations ever - intoscreens.com,7,10 July 2020,"Based on the acclaimed graphic novel by Greg Rucka and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Beyond The Lights), The Old Guard is a gritty, grounded, action-packed story that shows living forever is harder than it looks. With twists and turns lurking around every corner, Prince-Bythewood finds a way to keep the film grounded for the small screen, while exploring these immortal warriors' backstory, keeping some interesting side plots unexplored for the inevitable sequel.A covert group of tight-knit mercenaries with a mysterious inability to die have fought to protect the mortal world for centuries. But when the team is recruited to take on an emergency mission and their extraordinary abilities are suddenly exposed, it's up to them to help the group eliminate the threat of those who seek to replicate and monetize their power by any means necessary.The Old Guard in some ways shares a similar vibe with other Netflix Original, 'Extraction' - starring Chris Hemsworth. Luckily, this is just the case in the first half hour of the film, just in time to kick things off and get a bit more supernatural when we get acquainted with this group of undead combatants. Because unlike 'Extraction' which relied mostly on its main star, The Old Guard knows how to put every single one of his stars in the spotlight. Charlize Theron (Bombshell) is for sure the biggest name on the cast list, but the story was definitely written for an ensemble, with each character being just as important as its leader, working towards a satisfying finale.The film delivers on the impressive action-heavy scenes, filled with bloody fist fights, which are perfectly choreographed. This team of fast healing soldiers work well together, after having been around each other for centuries. And although the film is set in modern times, they find a way to incorporate some medieval weapons that feel more natural to the time they initially lived in.The film's acting is strong overall. Totally unrecognisable, after impressing audiences and critics with her more timid performance in 2018's 'If Beale Street Could Talk', KiKi Layne shows a completely different side of herself, as a soldier stationed in Afghanistan. Nile gets injured while patrolling with her all female team, but even though she should've died, she miraculously heals and gets recruited as the newest member of The Old Guard. Theron, who really doesn't seem to age, this time takes form as Andy, who's the oldest member of the team. Like a true acting chameleon, she once again convinces as not only a ferocious action star, but also bringing genuine emotion and charisma to a character that if portrayed by someone else might've felt a lot more apathetic. Matthias Schoenaerts (The Laundromat) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Maleficent: Mistress of Evil), both well known to deliver fantastic dramatic performances, are as usual good in their respective roles, but don't really seem challenged in this action flick.The story doesn't feel as fleshed out as it could've been, but there's definitely potential and it never gets boring. The one thing that's missing, is the amount of flashback scenes. We get a few glimpses at The Old Guard's former lives, who are basically ancient, but unfortunately the film's budget didn't allow the scope of these scenes to be bigger than life. Especially when we get to discover Joe (Aladdin's Marwan Kenzari, who's much better cast here than he was as Jafar) and Nicky's (Luca Marinelli - Trust) awesome backstory, when Joe passionately tells us about his undying love for Nicky. A gay love story that doesn't feel stereotypical, and this in a mainstream action film, is a huge step forward for equal representation in Hollywood. A scene that definitely could've had a bigger impact on the viewers' emotional state when fully reenacted, but nonetheless powerful. Perhaps in a possible sequel, Netflix and the film's creative team can expand on this and deliver something truly grand.As a comic book adaption, The Old Guard will please a lot of genre fans, and in the right hands could easily be turned into a franchise. Let's just hope writer Greg Rucka raises the stakes with future comics and dials the emotional factor up to an eleven, by really making its audience feel more connected to these truly remarkable group of warriors.",The Old Guard
154,nicci1972,Reminds me of Hancock,9,16 July 2020,I love Charlize in anything she plays in. This is very much reminiscent of the last immortal movie Charlize played in. I enjoyed this movie.,The Old Guard
155,nebk,There Can Be Only One!,5,10 July 2020,"In the Scottish highlands an immortal wakes up after being killed in battle...wait, wrong movie! In South Sudan a bunch of immortal mercenary do-gooders led by Andy (Charlize Theron) are discovered and attacked by a powerful pharmaceutical company that wants their DNA
in order to cure illnesses and make money. The plot thickens when a new immortal recruit is discovered. There is also an obligatory double cross since no movie these days can exist without someone betraying them.The soundtrack feels completely wrong for the movie, and having immortal action heroes is kind of boring since even killing them doesn't stop them. But they may actually die at any time since apparently they can be killed eventually and stop being immortal when its plot convenient. At least in Highlender only a beheading could knock off an immortal. Here they could be killed at any time so the logical thing is to obviously spend a millennium rushing into battle without armour and get shot without care knowing that it will probably be ok. As long as you are very young to the immortal life or it's not your time. Which it might be if it is going to add extra tension to the final act of the movie. And of course room is left for a sequel in the last few scenes of this film. Maybe they could call it The Quickening of the old guard. Darn, I mixed it up with another Highlander Film.The cast is very good overall but the stand out of this movie for me was Matthias Schoenaerts who seems to disappear into every role that he acts in be it as a villain or a good guy. The cast overall is good in fact and do as much as they can but they can't elevate a mediocre film to a good one. The action sequences are also quite well done. In the end however, like Charlize Theron says at one point ""does it really matter?"" Unfortunately, no it doesn't. It's a watchable movie but also a forgettable one.",The Old Guard

Also,one of them was banished from the group because he commited treason earlier in the film that resulted in Andy's capture.

158,Hussain-AL-Naseer,Should've been a Web-Series rather then a Feature Film - its actually 6.5,6,17 July 2020,"As stated in the premise section the film is about the team of immortal mercenaries who use to help and safe people since many centuries not showed but stated in the movie and now in this era of technology and world being a global village they struggle to keep their identity secret. A young Pharma CEO wishes to experiment on them and wish to decode their DNA's apparently for the sake of Humanity which as always not the case and Evil is always there to f''k things up.
Film looked half cooked as not much of a details provided about their inception but just little glimpses of past which were interesting, hoping that in future I would get more from it as ending promises other installments. Also I feel that it would've been more better if Netflix had opted for web series comprised over 3 to 4 seasons rather then a feature movie but I guess this might have caused them Theron out of the project.
Action sequences were well choreographed I liked the fusion of Sword & guns. Charlize Theron doing all the heavy liftings looked gorgeous badass woman with her effortless action sequences which always look eye pleasing and an Old Guard is no different.
Overall the film has yet to answer many questions and I hope with its interesting premise I would get to explore more about the immortals from its future sequels.",The Old Guard

160,cbnewham,Good but could have been great,7,11 July 2020,"It's got plenty of action and the idea is intriguing, even if it was inspired by Highlander. Theron channels Trinity from the Matrix - there are many similarities there both in looks and attitude.However, there are quite a number of issues that make this film good but not great.There are plenty of plot holes, and for me the main one was Quynh. She is thrown overboard in an iron coffin. Surely these experts, who have lived for hundreds of years, would know that iron corrodes. Quynh would have escaped that coffin within a hundred years. So the guilt that was driving Andy, and thus crucial to the character, was misplaced.What happens if they have a head cut off? Or even a limb? Considering the number of bladed weapons being used, I'm surprised the film didn't address what is a rather important aspect of their regeneration.The two things that really annoyed were the music, which was totally inappropriate, and the over-the-top wokeness. I don't care if two guys are in a relationship. I don't however, want it thrust down my throat in the most ham-fisted way possible. None of my gay friends are so overt. So why do it in a movie other than to show us you are making it a point.There are other aspects of this PC drivel that pervade this movie. If movies are going to continue to foist this on us then I can see I'll be watching fewer and fewer. I watch to be entertained, not to be educated in the views of the overly-virtuous.Seven stars; grasping for nine but never reaching it.",The Old Guard

163,mbrcf,has too many flaws,4,16 January 2021,"I'll try to talk about the things I did or didn't like about this film here.The things I liked:+ All the talking. I've read some complaints on internet about how talky this film was. Well, the talkings were the most enjoyable parts of the film for me, especially the growing relationship between Andi (Charlize Theron) and Nile (KiKi Layne). These scenes brought much of the character development to the cast, helping the plot to find its footing.+ Action choreography. Though it takes a lot from Wick franchise, its still solid, able to draw some excitement out of the viewers.+ Chailize theron. Yep, her presence makes this whole film a lot better. I can't imagine a scenario that the film is merely watchable with any other actress instead of her.The things I didn't like:The score. The score in this film is probably the worst I've ever heard. I unironically LOLed when a Marshmello song played at the film's climax. Whoever conducted the score for this film must review their choices.The laziness. I expect if we are presented with a scene from medieval or pre-medieval England, then the characters would speak the language of that era, not modern English. These errors in the flashback scenes may seem very minor and ignorable to many, but I find them rude and tasteless.Predictability. Here in this film the major plot lines and twists are fairly easy to guess. If you'd suspect something is bound to happen, it will eventually take place down in the line.Overall this has too many flaws and cracks to be enjoyable, it has some values within though.",The Old Guard

169,just_in_case,"Entertaining, but very derivative",6,12 July 2020,"Throughout the run time of Old Guard I kept having this nagging feeling that I'd kind of seen all this before. Immortals who have been around forever and can't die, but have a mysterious background. Then on the fifth or so time the movie measurably stopped for Charlize Theron to mug the camera and look morose it occurred to me - She played this same character in Hancock. The whole movie kinda reeks of ""I saw this play out already in another movie.""I think I ultimately left pretty disappointed. I can't really put my finger on it but I feel like I've seen this movie about 5 times already. It doesn't help that Bloodshot just came out and did a similar blood sponge hero guy thing..ah deadpool also.Bear with me I'm fine with any number of these last action immortal gun hero movies as long as its interesting, you know Deadpool tapped into so many ideas its almost a genre onto itself. This.. not so much.The movie follows what initially are empathetic, interesting, immortal mercenary do-gooders as they do a job, get betrayed, battle an evil one note CEO villain guy, lose powers yadda yadda I've lost interest in describing this. You've seen this movie.There was definitely room to do something different here. I like all the actors, even the plunky new member James McAvoy...no wait that was ""Wanted"" a movie about immortal gun slinger mercenary heros...the plucky new member KiKi Layne joining the group of immortal gun slinger mercenary heros....you get where I'm going with this.No this is the same old deal.

The goodies, the baddies and the double crosser. All fluffed up with fight scenes, explosions and gunfire. The action is probably the only realistic thing, even if it is plastered all over the place for no good reason. The effects are all good and have grit.My mind kept referring back to Austin Powers. The baddie is that comical (but not in a funny way). The plot is childlike and felt very amateur. Take the prime star out and this is a B Roll movie that never gets watched.The London scenes at the end were just bizarre. Empty streets and then suddenly full with crowds and Police. Making no sense whatsoever. This quality of story telling is very poor considering who is in the film.Overall, a promising film that immediately failed to deliver anything other that a straight to VHS Sunday story. Lacking the story and direction to make it credible. Then the attempt to create a sequel... so ham fisted in its execution. It just finished on a cringe... not a masterpiece!

The plot is well rounded and defined, there are no a lot of unclear situations in plot, there is a few but they are well masked in the story so that it does not spoil the whole experience. While the movie is interesting there are some unnecessary stuff such as exaggeration in the scenes of the inter-team relationship, showing romantic scenes where they are visibly inserted just to show what is obvious and this definitely spoiled the whole experience.

How can an immortal who heals from bullet wounds, stab wounds, etc have pierced ears? Why don't the holes in her ears heal up? And that question, folks, highlights just about the only intriguing thing you'll find in this film.The entire movie is ridiculous. I only watched it all the way through to see how it would end. (Plus, I like Charlize and am also a bit of a masochist, I guess.) All of my patience was rewarded with an ending that is just as moronic and predictable as the dialogue, the plot, the soundtrack (such as it is). What a lame ending.Do yourself a favor and watch someone else. If you really want entertainment, try watching The Magicians or The Umbrella Academy or Mandalorian.

She works hard for action and it shows.This movie works on many levels but falters in some. They try hard and succeed to give every member of this band some heart and soul which I appreciated a lot. The action choreography takes cues from the now trendy John wick popularised (Equilibrium: am I joke to you?) Gunfu and it does work in many sequences and then it doesn't in some areas. I think what was missing is the lack of use of props in surroundings. The stunts are all good.The direction is good and script is strictly okay. They don't take any bold moves and that's fine, I hope they do better with the sequel (which is teased).What leaves a bad taste in mouth is the background score which for some reason it is background music?? Some guy thought playing edm tracks from his playlist, which cheesily fits into the narrative would be a good idea. No, it was distracting and I never wanna hear a marshmello song ever in any action movies.Overall, this is a good movie to watch once or twice with some beer and popcorn.

Yeah, no thanks.",The Old Guard
178,IamROCKAS,Average level of enjoyment,5,18 May 2021,"The old Guard had a good concept, I admit that. If only it didn't focus that much on choreographed action sequences, over-the-top shootouts, and other David vs Goliath kinds of fights, this would have been a masterpiece. I'm not a fan of flashbacks but I feel like this movie has the perfect premise to them - to see how their past actions reflect on reality, how a difficult situation is solved by taking knowledge from a bad experience in the past or just giving a glimpse of how the immortals remember a location decades or centuries ago, especially if the location is in ruins now. Maybe I'm just not a fan of (this kind of) action anymore and I would like a deeper exploration into different themes. A more psychological approach to the psyche of the protagonists that lived through centuries would probably be more appropriate for me.Although this movie is not cinematically stunning, it did feature some great shots of locations in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Though it was mostly oriented around the actors, I did enjoy seeing the contrast between a desert location an urban city scenery. Though the urban locations had more disregards to logic when it came to the plot (for example - nobody is alerted that there's a shooting in a building, I doubt someone would ignore it; conveniently, nobody is around when two bodies fall on the ground, yet the police and other people arrive to witness it just as our protagonists have gotten away from the scene of the incident). For a movie that's over 2 hours long, they tend to build up high and you just notice that action is more important than acting.Speaking of acting, it is a bit weird in this movie. I don't know why screenwriters for Hollywood action include swearing in a way that seems boring, it just sometimes feels like a ""swearing is cool, let's add some here and there"" mentality and it just usually feels cringe more than badass. The dialogues got so boring that my favorite quote came in from a side character. Perhaps not even a side-character, I don't know if there's a word for this role but she just had one scene in the movie and she used that screen time to deliver my favorite line in the movie. ""Your business is yours. You need help. It doesn't matter why"" is a simple line, yet it portrays a really warm gesture from a human being. I wish it was brought up later, as Andy stated humanity could burn for all she cared, yet there are still people that provide assistance when needed without asking for something in return or getting deep into a strangers' business.Overall, I wouldn't say I enjoyed the movie a lot but it wasn't so bad either. I guess I just got tired of Hollywood-level action and it just seems like looking at the same picture with the details flipped around and with a different signature at the bottom-left corner. I liked the premise, I really did, but unfortunately for me, they didn't focus on it too much and just went for almost a full-on action. It also seems they planned on a sequel and I would probably watch it when it comes but I just don't see them improving if action is all they have in mind.

While there were several actions I found entertaining and the performances were fine, I just didn't find myself feeling any connection with the characters and the storyline was a little generic with no WOW moments. I feel they may be doing a sequel to this, which I can't say I am very excited for.Quote - ""Its near impossible to disappear in the world we live in today"" - AndyScore- 4/10",The Old Guard

I read the reviews before I watched the movie. But I thought the reviews were way off. There was nothing wrong with the music. The actors were very good and well cast.
At least they didn't fill the movie with loud rap music, which seems to be the way to go now a days. But the music seemed to fit the scene it was meant to.
It wasn't slow and boring at all. Good paced.
But it's worth a watch.",The Old Guard

Honestly - these movies which, let's be real, are always an introduction to a franchise - are just a rehashing of whatever director's favorite cliches from other action/comic book movies. The hero craning/twisting his/her neck while that cracking sound happens... the hero igniting a giant explosion while they walk away from it, towards the camera without flinching even a tiny bit when the big CGI 'splosion happens. The same, tired fight scenes that Keenu did 50 years ago in The Matrix. Seriously, don't people ever get tired of seeing the same movie with slightly different actors spouting the same lame catch phrases like 'Go big or go home'? It's simply exhausting. Try something new. People have been eating the same meal for their eyes for decades.",The Old Guard

Charlize Theron does (IMO) a bang up job as the leader of a group of 'Immortals' who for centuries have been battling evil around the World. The Scythian (Charlize) is given a very human side and has for a millennia carried a heavy burden on her shoulders and in her heart. The group of four Immortals find a 'new' one and this has a profound event on Charlize - on several levels. Bad guy (played by a young nerd) wants to 'save the world' and, of course, make billions by extracting their DNA. Ending was interesting, and left this open to a sequel. Candidly?

196,ramblingvagabond,Movie for a New Age,4,11 July 2020,"This movie has all the intersectionality tropes any modern American could ask for. It covers all the various identities, it talks about the terrible state of the world, and it's aggressively anti-Christian. I would say anti-religious since they discuss how God doesn't exist, but certain religions are immune from this condemnation.When the main character keeps whining about how the world is so much worse now, I'm wondering compared to what. Things looked pretty bad during WWII, WWI, and a thousand wars before that. The Crusades weren't exactly a good time. Or maybe she's just referring to recent decades when things were horrible but our good old American press refused to report on anything that might disparage any of their favorite leaders.Charlize Theron quickly develops into an incredibly unlikable character. She's alway's right while the new person, KiKi Layne, is always wrong. Theron has seen it all and knows it all and is just too cool and slick. Believe me, the audience sides with Layne. We quickly began wishing Theron would die early.Overall, 4 or 5 out of 10. It sets itself up for a sequel that will never happen, which just means the ending is vague and unfinished. Too much of this was predictable and cliched.",The Old Guard
197,GavWaskett,I intend to live forever..or die trying!,7,13 September 2020,"I was intrigued when this was first advertised, a Netflix action blockbuster with Charlize Theron in it based on a Graphic Novel, it seemed that everything was aligning in the film world for a great summer film; in the current craziness and without cinema access, good films have been as hard to find as an honest politician! I was pretty excited and bagsied the TV on a Saturday night with the promise to Shell that she was bound to be in for a treat(I'm such a great other half!).In preparation, I moseyed on over to a certain online store, that is like the Nile but on a different continent. No free advertising from me! Anyway, I digress, I purchased the Graphic Novel and set about learning about the world I was about to delve into. Honestly, the Graphic Novel was a bit blah! Good story, but didn't grip me and I wasn't a fan of the artistry, not that I can talk as I'm proud of myself if I can paint by numbers! However, it should have been a warning bell for me, but oh no, not me, I forged ahead towards Saturday!Just like in a Sean Bean film, when Saturday came, I donned my Sheffield United top, and sat down for 90 minutes of adrenalin fuelled, end to end action. Or a 125 minutes long film at the very least. The story was similar to that of the book, a group of mercenaries are the best at what they do, kind of like The A-Team but with the extra bonus of being able to live for a very long time and not having to live in the Los Angeles underground. They can get shot, stabbed, blown up, poisoned, tickled to death and up they pop, give them a bit of time to grow some skin or for their eyeballs to de-liquify or their intestines to suck back in and they are good to go - I mean no wonder they are top of their game when they can literally outlive the opposition.Things aren't that simple, after centuries of just getting on with their thing, the modern world has noticed them, dang these modern paraphernalia of cameras and the internet - things are about to get up close and personal, add to that a new Old Guard member, who has luckily just popped up at well and we have a movie.Well, we have a movie if you're just up for lots of blood and gore and injuries that can heal - think of Hayden Panettiere's character in Heroes and times it by four, sometimes five! Explosions and double crosses and a rather moody Miss Theron. Then you are in for treat.Charlize Theron has a bit of action previous, with Mad Max and Atomic Blond and she is an outstanding actress, so she is good value throughout, the other characters don't really get to show their personalities to much, apart from some great scenes between Luca Marinelli's Nicky and Marwan Kenzari's Joe, which added some much needed humanity to the proceedings, the surprise was Harry Potter's Cousin Dudley, aka Harry Melling turning up as a business tycoon; I really was just waiting for Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw to be sitting in a floral front room at the top of his penthouse being kept to the standard they wanted to get used to.Don't get me wrong, this was an enjoyable action film and it might well be the start of a series of films which could open up this world much more, I think my problem was reading the Graphic Novel first and not really enjoying that, it gave me a bias I couldn't get passed and I pretty much knew what was going to happen as well. So, don't be a Dabbler and ruin it for yourselves! If you have Netflix, it's free and worth a couple of hours on a Saturday night.

198,lenusme,It had potential but...,7,5 September 2020,"First, I love Charlize Theron (Andy) but the main problem with this movie is that it had potential and they failed terribly at addressing such potential. There are a lot of plot holes, wasted time in nonsense, unnecessary excess of drama, and other flaws.

199,shimenpf,Didn't enjoy,5,18 July 2020,"I frankly didn't enjoy the movie very much. I feel the script is flawed, mainly in pace. For an action movie, the script stops very frequently for characters to have intimate and emotional conversations. This kind of dialogue is good for creating empathy with the characters and making them feel multidimensional, but I feel in this case, this was done in excess, sacrificing in making the plot more dynamic and engaging. I also think Book's betrayal was unfounded, and lacked an appropriate setup that foreshadowed this. We did not know before the moment of his betrayal, that he did not like being immortal, so the twist felt like pulled out of nowhere.",The Old Guard

Action, acting, fight, direction - all.It was not a typical Netflix project, riding on the shoulders of just a big Star (CT), even supporting casts did remarkable acting.Waiting for it's sequel, hope it gets made (as per ending), but don't lose your streak the second time (like most sequels do, esp on Netflix).",The Old Guard

The couple were sweet but then the ""is he your boyfriend?"" Scene. Dude a ""yes would have worked. That was just cheesy after school woke bs, it distracts.

The soundtrack was also pretty subpar with weird vocal interlude's it had that cliche two girls fight so we need to have a pop/rap song over it so it feels more fun cos two women fighting can't ever be taken seriously, and as another note of how strange this movie felt like halfway through all the guns just stopped having classic Hollywood muzzle flashes and just had nothing like they ran out of budget or something cos all the gunshots were just stock sound effects it was visually boring even like a puff of smoke from the gun like in real life would have been nice.
Oh the plot was cliche and boring it brought nothing new to the table it had interesting concept and there were like interesting looking flashbacks but other than that just plain mediocre how this has a higher rating than extraction I don't know.",The Old Guard

📜 Plot: A covert team of immortal mercenaries are suddenly exposed and must now fight to keep their identity a secret just as an unexpected new member is discovered.
.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : The Old Guard is a Netflix Original Film led by Charlize Theron and Kiki Layne. The Movie is a pure action fantasy entertainer which has amusing BGM and intense action set pieces. The story speaks about a team of 4 immortals who have lived through centuries and doing everything what they felt right and are led by Charlize Theron as Andy who is the oldest amongst them. Even though they have been alive for centuries, the Old Guard have still not figured out why they have been chosen and their roles throughout history. Accustomed to suicide missions, they have been covertly protecting humanity from self-destruction.Charlize Theron is kick ass throughout and has brilliantly portrayed the role of Andy who has lived through ages. Kiki Layne gives a praiseworthy performance and has done her part with conviction. The Other Actors have done fair. The problem with the movie is after watching it for two hours you dont take anything back from it. Except Andy none of the actors have any sort of Character Development.Probably the reason is that this is a new Netflix Franchise as shown in climax. There is plot twist right before the credits which intrigues us to believe that a wrath is coming upon the Guards. Lets See if they drop a sequel.
.
.
👍Goods : Charlize Theron is irresistibly kick ass and delivers outstanding stunts, The Action pieces are quiet enticing , Steady Screenplay .
.
.
👎 Bads : We deserved better character development of all the guards, Nothing exceptional or Unique about the premise
.
.
🔥 Final Rating : 7/10
.
.
✅ Recommendation : The Old Guard is entertaining but in overall its an average affair to say the least. Watch it if you crave for action movies.

209,Nomad007,Just okay,6,11 July 2020,"My type of move and I generally really like her movies. But this movie just seems to fall flat. There's not emotion to it. Plenty of action but it just doesn't feel exciting. And she doesn't really seem to either for the role, which would be odd since she's done many like this, it's no longer her speed, or she just doesn't put the same energy into it that she did 10. 15, 20 years ago. Perhaps this is just what you get with Netflix these days; people who are still A list material but haven't done A list work in some time and a Netflix just throws a huge check at them they no longer can can demand for theater work anymore. Don't necessarily regret watching it but perhaps watching some of her (or someone else's) work ""again"" or even 2 hours of YouTube videos might have been time better spent. Unfortunately even with a pandemic currently going on and almost no new material even this wasn't even to get exited enough. Well to be honest the trailer was enough to get excited but the whole movie is itself just flat regardless of how much ""action"". Tries to cover too many audiences groups and cover as many bases as bases as this dilutes the movie trying to not offend anyone and thus it looses its direction and story. They advertise her as the the lead but she's more supporting than anything. I'm a total fan of hers and of these general types of movies but they spend too much time and effort on the script and cast trying to reach every audience instead of just telling a story. If you try and make everyone happy you make NO ONE happy.",The Old Guard
210,Wikkid_Gamez,Why all the hate?.... I really liked it!...,9,14 July 2020,"I'm glad I watched it before reading all these reviews.... I personally really liked it and really hope they make a sequel! I see people comparing it to Highlander among other things and I don't think that it should be. The only thing it even has in common is the aspect of immortality. I have a feeling some of these negative reviews are because people expected it to tie in with one thing or other. I went into it with an open mind not knowing what to expect or expecting anything. I just finally got the time to put something on this morning and when I got on Netflix it was on the top display showing the preview and I recognized Charlize Theron (Mad Max Fury Road, Atomic Blonde, Snow White and the Huntsman etc) Matthias Schoenaerts (The Mustang, Bullhead, The Danish Girl etc) and I really like them both and it looked interesting so I just went with it. I thought the soundtrack was good actually, not sure what the issue is for some. It helped create a certain vibe and I can see why they did it the way they did, and I loved the overall theme of the movie. All in all another great addition by Netflix!",The Old Guard
211,juliendussault,"Good concept, poor execution",1,25 July 2020,"This movie could have been good, and it was good for about 35 minutes but then it just slowly but surely became so incredibly boring that I found myself looking more of my phone that I did the TV screen. The music was horrible, the story was horrible and honestly don't believe any of the hype that is behind this film. Charlize Theron is old and needs to work, and it shows.",The Old Guard
212,MovieWarfare,"Interesting premise, great first half but poor second half",6,19 July 2020,"With more movies constantly being delayed because of the Coronavirus, the only new movies appearing seems to be streaming service movies. The Old Guard is an American superhero (sort of) movie based on the comic book of the same name. It is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood who I'll be honest I am not familiar with and also written by Greg Rucka who wrote the comic book. I was very interested in watching this movie after seeing the first trailer as the premise of immortal badasses sounds very interesting. Plus it has Charlize Theron who is awesome and Chiwetel Ejiofor who has always been great in my opinion.First things I will praise is the main heroes cast. Charlize is still pretty badass as ""Andy"" and very convincingly so. The new recruit ""Nile Freeman"" played by KiKi Layne gives a great performance as a sort of POV character for the viewer. The supporting cast is also pretty good with Matthias Schoenaerts as ""Booker"" giving a very conflicting emotion to being an immortal, Marwan Kenzari as ""Joe"" who gives a very memorable speech while being very romantic and Luca Marinelli as ""Nicky"" who is quite the witty guy. Every single one of them is quite charming and from their performance alone can give the audience a sense of their personality. Most of the actors are also great in these action scenes and it is very obvious that these actors threw themselves into practising these action scenes themselves.The villains in this movie, however, is something I am quite mixed about. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays one of the villain ""James Copley"" who is meant to be more sympathetic and there is a great emotional performance from him in the third act, comes out as very predictable and plain. Harry Melling from Harry Potter fame as ""Steven Merrick"" who is the main villain for the second half comes out as over the top and cartooney which contrasts massively with the others who are more grounded and believable.The action scenes are very clearly inspired by John Wick and are pretty cool to watch albeit they don't do anything new with it. They are filmed a bit weird with a lot of zooms and sometimes random shaky cam although the shakiness isn't Jason Bourne bad and are still visible. My problem is the lack of action scenes. There are not a lot which is kind of disappointing and the trailer pretty much showed all the action scenes in the movie.The premise with the immortals which is one of the reasons why I wanted to watch the movie is generally pretty good and utilised mostly effectively but no character ever loses a limb which is a shame considering you have immortal characters. The rules of their immortality is a bit iffy and not completely explained which kind of irks me a bit and feels a little bit lazy.The story is something I am also a bit mixed about. The first half of the movie with it about training a new immortal ""Nile"" is really enjoyable. Seeing the conflict between long time immortal ""Andy"" and new immortal was great and seeing their different opinions about life was interesting. The emotional moments in the movie are great as well. Seeing ""Nile"" clash with the fact that she can't even die or age and realising she might not ever see her family again was saddening. ""Andy"" and ""Booker"" talking about their heart-wrenching past with flashbacks to help illustrate it as well is genuinely great stuff. As I stated before but ""James Copley"" gives a believable explanation to his motive that is very sympathetic. If this movie did anything right then it was these emotional moments and fleshing out the characters. However, the second half of this movie feels like a cliche of superhero movies and turns this movie into feeling generic. They now have to take down over the top bad guy dude from Harry Potter and this is where the story takes a large dip for me.My final criticism with the movie has got to be the soundtrack. It sucks. The soundtrack contains a lot of pop songs which kind of took me out of the movie as it tends to contrast with the scene that was happening right now. For example, they play a pop song to build up an action scene and it just feels dumb.Overall, despite my fair amount of criticism, the movie is okay. It doesn't do anything revolutionary or make me come out of it feeling something or thinking about something but I did still have a good time. The movie premise had great ideas but might have worked a lot better as a TV show in my opinion. Still, it does end with the blatant sequel tease and despite it all, I would be interested in watching a sequel.",The Old Guard
213,Mccadoo,Standard action movie that could have been better,5,19 March 2021,"The premise has been done before but still had promise, it just wasn't explored well at all. Instead they made a standard shoot-em-up movie with lots of fights and shoot-outs. Something you can see in dozen's of other films. There were also way too many plot holes to let slide....good writing is hard isn't it?It would have been more interesting had they explored the immortality angle more, here they just used it as a plot crutch to take advantage of the main characters not being able to be killed, that's about it. And the scenes where the heroes are restrained to be ""studied"" looked like something out of an old 50's sci-fi movie.And Charlize Theron's played her character as a very bland and uninteresting hard ass...not very believable for a character who's supposed to have lived for thousands of years. I understand that she was trying to portray her as burned out and disillusioned but I think that's something the character would have already dealt with, probably a thousand years or so ago. At two or three thousand years old I would expect her to be a hell of a lot more evolved by now....or a raving lunatic. And one last thing; Ms. Theron really needs to eat something! She looked much more believable as a bad ass in Atomic Blond, here she looks a bit anorexic.Overall a decent popcorn movie, just don't expect great writing, great acting or a gripping plot. This is a passable movie for a slow night that's quickly forgotten after viewing, that's about it.",The Old Guard
214,DunkelheitVZ,Loved every second of it and I am hoping for more,9,11 July 2020,"When I watch a movie, I don't think about colour of skin, gender, messages or propaganda. I just want to be entertained. And this movie entertained me every single second of its run.
I love this movie, not because there are homesexual people in it or the main heroine is female or because the colour of skin of the teammembers is variegated (if that is the right word, I am not a native speaker). Neither do I hate it out of this reason. I just don't care about agenda or progaganda or however you want to name this.This movie is great, the actionscenes are amazing, the story is comprehensive and mysterious, the characters are great, it all makes sense in this universe and it has enough in it to spawn multiple sequels. It is not just a brainless action movie, this could be the start of something amazing.
The end had me floored and desperate for at least another movie.You will be hardpressed to find a movie that I don't know, I am watching films intensively for 30 years now.

I was expecting action and a minimum of plot development without insulting my intelligence. Unfortunately what they have done is a result of nonsense dialogues, poor action scenes and terrible directing.

I thought I was watching Dr. Evil of Austin Powers fame without the humor. I was waiting for him to laugh evily, pet his cat and put his little finger in his mouth.In the beginning of the movie, after covertly erasing a stranger's cellphone to protect their secret status, a group of immortals were meeting with the black doctor (who later betrayed them) to get info on their next mission. They're sitting in a crowded open air restaurant with people bustling about their table and on the sidewalk, traffic in the nearby street, buildings all around with windows --- they're having a top secret meeting talking about rescuing women from a Muslim/Arab terrorist group, and talking about their immortal superhero abilities and accomplishments --- in a Middle Eastern bazzar, within eye and ear shot of the whole world. And of course --- only in a movie --- no one around them is paying attention. So stupid and unrealistic.I see this all the time in movies and TV shows. Whether it's detectives walking down a crowded sidewalk, talking about a murder investigation. Or a top secret meeting, or a sensitive personal conversation, in a crowded restaurant. And only on camera is NOBODY PAYING ATTENTION. That never happens to me in public, in real life. People look at each other. And they listen to what people are saying.",The Old Guard

However, expectations of mine were nvr met & I didn't try to predict anything as I usually do because there really was no need to. With all honesty I CAN'T WAIT for the next part, if there is one...
PS.... Don't end it to too early this might leave u still questioning & right now is the time I'm attempting to predict because I think I know whats up but have no clue how!Do I recommend it? What do u think?
Yet 1 more thing, ""to me"", how I feel about this movie is how I feel about Blade (98', 02', & 04') and Underworld (03', 09', 06', 12', & 16') which I can't wait for more but maybe like how much I LOVE & miss Troy 2004..",The Old Guard

2. The script was a little lame at times. Dialog was unnatural or occasionally just out of place.

Their capabilities and plots are set in a massive opening block of Squeeze.The action and story are cleverly mixed. They are followed by an emotional drama that adds to the overall experience.The story rides on several projects. It is not just the action in this film. Another aspect of The Old Guard is that it demands an emotional investment of the audience.The narrative has been served more awkwardly or with self-irony in place that may split the audience into opinions.There is hardly a twist in the narrative, but the plot point is left strangely unexplained.The basic plot is excellent and worth watching, but the thrill in the narrative is quite soft. The pace of the story is not enough. But when it comes to actions then it is successful.PerformanceCharlize Theron as Andy appears in another kick-action role. Charlize has played a strong character in all her films for the last few years.Charlize Theron is a perfect example of the actress's unique ability, which brings a less emotional connection to the action and character.The character of Matthias Schoenaerts is non-stop and worth watching.I loved the character of Kiki Layne and her performance.

It plays with dramatic themes like carrying the wait of an extremely old age, but every single character feels 2D, like cardboard. The music is a random mess. It doesn't fit the movie whatsoever.

245,gazzalodi,Charlize Theron carries for the win,8,11 July 2020,"The problem with casting the best actress of her generation is that if you don't surround her with a-list talent it can get a little awkward. The writers apparently knew this and limited a lot of the supporting cast's dialogue to snappy one liners. Chiwetel Ejiofor does a good turn as the kinda-villain but his final plot swerve came off as a cheap way to set up a sequel. The main villain was just a horrible casting choice, and was so ridiculously one dimensional. He could have easily been fleshed out and given honorable goals that put him at odds with the heroes, rather than just turning him into a sadistic greedy evil billionaire. Kiki Layne is good at the 'new kid'. She doesn't come off as bad as Kristen Stewart did in Snow White, but it's still obvious there's a different level of talent when she shares scenes with Theron. The music for the sound track wasn't the best either.Overall the movie was enjoyable and moved along well. Hopefully there will be more in the future, with more complex villains.",The Old Guard

I could not identify a plot. The movie to me just dragged on an on interrupted by some really good action scenes with very high quality CGI, but everything thereafter was a letdown.Dialogue sequences did not at all to me seem relevant or adding to the story line which I still do not know what it was. I could not relate with the characters and their interaction seemed like soft clay... you gotta really squeeze it to get some form of shape out of it..
In essence this is a movie about some immortals who have progressed in time to meet up to become a kill squad of bad guys.Overall, I feel like what I was watching was a compilation of scenes extracted from a multi episode mini-series. The story did not flow. It seemed broken up.
To me it seemed to be full of blanks leaving me asking ""how did we get to this point""?I did not enjoy this movie at all.

248,Abranth-d,Comic book lore meets Netflix action movie.,7,17 July 2020,"Here's my review of 'The Old Guard'. So 'Old Guard' is the latest straight to Netflix movie starring Charlize Theron as the leader of a squad of contract killers who have a healing ability like the Wolverine's. These guys have lived through centuries cause of this ability and the oldest of them dating back to the age of Kings is Charlize Theron aka "" Andy "". The plot sounds straight out of a comic book , doesn't it ? I just googled it , and it turns out , it is. So a previous contractor of theirs who is also ex CIA played by Chiwetel Ejiofor ( Mordo from Dr strange ) teams up with this Norman Osbornish Dude who runs an Oscorpish pharma company to capture these guys and experiment on them . Now a movie like this looks and feels like a Netflix movie and I could see that as an emerging pattern , movies like this , Extraction and 6 underground all have brooding , lone wolf protagonists with fluid action scenes and gorgeous cinematography followed by a mainstream plot with a sequel tease ending. I'm not saying it's wrong , I'm only sensing a pattern here. This movie has some neat action sequences with great hand to hand combat and no shaky cam , which was really fun to watch. But what I really dug about this movie was not the action scenes but the exposition and the conversations . Cause I was intrigued by the dialogue where they spoke to each other about the losses they had to go through despite being immortal , there was this one line "" just because we're immortal , doesn't mean it'll stop hurting "" that human element along with what they know by living through history made this a good movie than an other straight to Netflix action movie. Charlize Theron's character is very similar to her previous ""She - John wick"" attempts in Aeon Flux and Atomic Blonde , tough but doesn't scream "" girl power "" nor is it over the top. Other characters were there but you don't really root for them , and there's this rookie chick who has just discovered her ability in this movie , it was as if someone was holding a board to her showing her lines , cause she very well couldn't act. An other thing I enjoyed was how they kept the motivations straight , everyone's motivation is simply justified and you know where it's coming from . I say this , cause you can go the generic "" evil Corp wants to make you a lab rat "" versus ""children of wolverine"" fight fest ! but they managed to give clear motivations and add enough to their own lore. With that being said , my problems with this movie were less , there were a couple of odd pop songs in the movie , other than that I thought it was a pretty decent action flick with a lot of comic book lore and a potential for a sequel.",The Old Guard

Every time one of the bad taste songs or background music plays, it takes me away from the story build up or immersion. The protagonist, Nile Freeman, is the least interesting character that pales in comparison with the four Old Guards.We wanted to know more about these Old Guards but we saw very little of their intriguing past, and by the end of the film, we are made to feel that all of these are just a prelude to something that could be more interesting.

I do loves actions and adaptions from comic books, Plus I don't really mind the gay character cause somehow I think they cute lol. We all know there's a possible sequel but I want those sequel turns into tv series, cause there's seem to be a lot to discover from all characters..Overall, I just want to say that too many people going in expecting a Tarantino Oscar worthy masterpiece.

257,lakings97,Another version of Highlander,7,15 August 2021,The Old Guard is a Netflix movie that stars Charlize Theron who leads a group of immortal mercenaries over centuries have helped those in need. Their purpose is to help those who can't help themselves but they they feel hopeless that mankind can't help themselves. The movie reminded me of Highlander but it never explained how or why they were immortals all they know is that they were exposed for their healing powers. Chiwetel Ejiofor deceives the group and leads a team to capture them. The flick was directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood and it seems Netflix is making a series of movies with the same concept. It was a good movie with plenty of action sequences and Charlize stands out from the crowd for her height and physical presence. Definitely add this to your list.,The Old Guard
258,Eric266,"A Slick Action Flick, but Bogs down at the End",6,5 November 2020,"The Old Guard is a Netflix original headlined by Charlize Theron as Andy, the leader of a group of immortal mercenaries. Her group consists of Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts), Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli). They discover a fifth immortal, an American Marine named Nile, played by Kiki Layne, who is not aware of her powers. She reluctanly ""joins"" the group (shangheid would be more apt) and the team attempts to hide out after their powers are discovered.A weirdo big pharm owner named Merrick (a goofy Harry Melling) wants their blood so he can create a serum that will make him rich selling it. The wonderful Chiwetel Ejiofor is badly underused as a man with a tragic background who wants to help Merrick find a cure for cancer, but is unknowingly helping a madman.The Old Guard really goes no where with the premise. Its just a bunch of shoot 'em up scenes and some exposition about their abilities. You know a film is lazy when it has to TELL you how cool its heroes are rather than show you. There are some flashbacks, but they are quick and left me feeling there was a better movie to tell in those time periods than the plot of present day.I understand there are sequels coming and maybe they will change my opinion, but it felt like so much of a great story was left out to make way for a lot of guns being fired.",The Old Guard
259,jimwt66,Good movie with some drawbacks,5,13 July 2020,"First the camera work was a little awkward at times. Second, the fight scenes looked like they memorized the steps and were performing them with a tempo beat telling them when to do each move. It might have been fine if the fight moves were faster but they were so slow you could imagine someone say ok now punch, now kick. It was even worse with the female fight scenes.Not sure what the age that people transform into an immortal. Does it only happen when they die? That would explain why Theron looks so old. She definitely is no spring chicken anymore. The new immortal just seemed annoying.Now with those things said, it was an otherwise decent movie. It will not win any awards but it is good enough to keep you entertained. The ending sets things up for a sequel but if they don't do it quick they will have to use a lot of makeup on Theron to try and keep her from looking tired. I only say that because I am guessing they might find a way for her to be immortal again. The new immortal isn't a good enough actress to fill the female lead.I saw some comments about ""woke"" moments in the movie but the only one that really stuck out was once again they had a gay couple in the movie. I cannot remember the last movie I saw where there was not a trans or gay person in it. For such a small demographic they sure are getting a lot of screen time. BLM might decide to attack Hollyweird for having more gay people than black people since estimates say gay population is like 4% and black population is around 17%.",The Old Guard

No amount of bang-bangs or pirouettes are going to sustain a bad story.The main problem with this script is it's been done before and much better. How can you not compare it with all those movies that came before it? The only time I believed Theron as a kick-ass fighter, was when she played a superhero. Even a twig with superpowers can throw 120 kilogram men around. Netflix we get it, women are stunning and brave, girl power woo-hoo.The only thing going for this film is it ticks the diversity boxes one after the other, after the other.

263,cristinalinderman,A somewhat entertaining superhero film.,6,11 July 2020,"*There is no end credit scene *The director Gina Prince-Bythewood and crew brought a somewhat entertaining superhero film. This adaptation is about an immortal team fighting to keep their identity a secret. I had high expectations when I watched the trailer but it was not what I expected. The movie had great fighting sequences and I wished for more teamwork action scenes. One of my favorite parts was when the team was taking bullet hits while trying to protect a certain character, what an awesome scene that should have been longer. The narrative needed more depth, there were certain scenes that felt forced or unnecessary and the tone was all over the place. The antagonist could have been better scripted because he gave it the cheesy tone in a storyline not made to be that. I dislike the fact this film felt like a TV series, and the choices of songs were proving that point even further.The songs created an annoying atmosphere and it was distracting the storyline. What was the point of having these composers Dustin O'Halloran and Hauschka if the goal were to have songs being the center of the film? I couldn't appreciate the music of these composers and there wasn't really any music theme to really define the immortal team. Such a shame, it is so important making the composed music as important to its film because it helps to create emotions.I was so interested in this film because of Charlize Theron, and she was magnificent as always! I never get tired of watching her being such a badass. As I watched the movie two actors caught my attention, Marwan Kenzari, and Luca Marinelli. They were one of the best on-screen couples, so adorable and those three were the ones making this film worth the watch. Even though the film wasn't what I expected, I'm still looking forward to the sequel for those three actors and I hope for better music and fewer songs or better yet no songs.",The Old Guard
264,pipo-,Such wasted potential,4,2 August 2020,"This movie was such a bore and I found myself fast forwarding through all the drama queen scenes which was most of the movie...Ugh the men are so weak in this movie they are all huggy kissy crying, I would expect after living for a few hundred years or longer you would have some skills and be a tough SOB, gay or not...but no they keep getting captured, can't escape from even basic clip down restraints, I guess they learned NOTHING in the years they were alive, geeze at least try to fight back.,,,,I was hoping they would find the girl in the ocean but...no (btw after a few hundred years in the ocean , that thing looked like it was made of iron and would or rusted and opened up, just look at the titanic after a 100 years.) ...anyways..movie just felt all over the place, they were alive for years but their skills just didn't reflect that, except for the lead character the rest of them were really useless.music score was mostly terrible, just playing some premade audio tracks rather then creating music.it had a good theme but a terrible script I could of rewrote this 100 ways better, actions was far between and had a bad flow, like at the end they are talking in the window nonchalant but were just in a huge gun fight seconds before, and they don't even notice the bad guy right in front of them, if you think about it they are actually staring right at him the whole time lol.bleh whatever...4/10

The only flaw is the main Villain is pretty lame, not only is his acting not that great (looked like they wanted Jesse eisenberg but couldn't get him) but his motives is basically what mr.krabs does for everything..... money. It sucks to when the movie shows other characters that have better motives and better backstory's than the actual main villains like booker who just wants to die and end it all, and you have Chiwetel Ejiofor who's wife dies and now wants to cure diseases.

Other than the great performances from the whole cast both in the action sequences as well as the emotional moments, I enjoyed the character development and how they all cope with their situation regarding their immortality.

''I think this whole thing so and so days later/earlier is a useless concept. I think stories should begin where they begin and stop with this days later/earlier''. And is very true about this movie. Even though they don't show that text about it being like a few hours earlier it is something that really made me just roll my eyes. And this thing about always calling the so called leader 'Boss' all the time just makes me cringe so hard and wonder if the directer thinks the audience are idiots with no eyes or brain. It was very clear and still was throughout the movie. It's like if you see a brother and sister and they keep calling each other bro and sis. For who? Yeah for the viewer which made me lose interest in the universe they tried me to believe in.It was pure pain to go through this movie and I must say do not trust all the praise for this movie.

Instead they're great at shooting and stabbing (but they look so cool doing it).And speaking of science, you really can study someone's genetics without torturing them.

And plot-holes. Oh so many plot-holes. It's like their skill level in fighting dynamically adjust to move the plot forward. They are either super soldiers or super incompetent - if the story needs that. For people who have fought hundreds or thousands of fights, they sure make some interesting mistakes.And you know what came into my mind?That Twilight (yes, Twilight) does the entire immortal thing a lot better.

293,yoyopa,What is Charlize doing?,4,12 July 2020,"Whatever she wants I suppose. Can't deny that she's earned it creatively BUT between this movie and Atomic Blonde... she's pretty much struck out with the action heroine stuff.The Old Guard: a study in mediocrityLets do pros and cons.CONS: Kiki Layne... incredibly miscast and hard to watch. Look, I'm a black, male, millennial. More than that... I'm a black actor, in NYC, about as progressive as it gets. I not only love badass female heroes but I grew up with them. For older generations... their heroes were Sly Stallone and those guys. I grew up loving Xena Warrior Princess. True story. There was a black woman for this role... Kiki was not the one. Given that the director also directed soulful films like Love and Bball I get why she cast Layne... it was the wrong choice and it was downright grating trying to watch her in SO MANY SCENES.Gina Prince-Bythewood was the wrong choice for director. This is not her element at all and it showed.The music: straight out of episodes of the Vampire Diaries. Seriously.An overabundance of Wokeness. Hollywood, you need to do better than this... you're job is to make people think... NOT TELL THEM WHAT TO THINK! You are only pissing people off with your lack of creativity in all this virtue signaling.Not nearly enough Charlize. It was ridiculous. I absolutely want more BIPOC representation in Hollywood but they cut half of Charlize's screen time to try and make Layne the star of this movie. That was a mistake.The all female Marine unit? what the actual F. This doesn't exist. Give me an effing break. There are 600 female marines in the ENTIRE Marine Corp. There are no all female combat ready Units IN ANY BRANCH.The story was overall lame and uninspired. Not nearly enough backstory to give a damn about the main storyline. These immortal soldiers fight to make the world better? Where? When? I saw next to no evidence of that save for the opening mission and even in that they slaughtered indiscriminately.The run time: 2 freakin hours. I barely made it. I must've stopped and went to do other stuff at least 10 different times.The criminal underuse of Chiwetel Ejiofor. He looked like he had nothing to do. Because he didn't.Production Value: Made for TV for sure.All in all I think both the director and Layne were the wrong choices for this film and it was obviously political. I've said this before... we need representation in hollywood BUT it has to be the right people for the right project or we're going to keep getting crap like this and giving ammunition to people who rail against representation in general.Bythewood had two of the most talented actors in a generation in Charlize and Chiwetel and she essentially made them supporting characters.Wondering how much more of these Skydance can crap out before they go under.PROS: Charlize is still one the greatest actresses of our generation. She did everything but save this dud. I wish the story had focused more on her character.Chiwetel Ejiofor: another rare talent completely underused. Even with nothing to do he still managed to outshine Layne the other forgettable characters.Matthias Schoenaerts had a great monologue about halfway through. It was one of the stronger moments of the film.The fight sequences were solid. Should have been more of them.That's about it.

307,MissFortuneCookie,Need sequel now!!,7,1 August 2020,Love the concept and the action and all of the immortal cast! My only complaint with this film is the music being used. They should've used original instrumental music/score other than one with lyrics as it just takes away from the overall vibe of the movie. I feel instrumental music would have been more epic. Imagine having an original score for this franchise! Some of the wardrobe choices are also questionable. Especially Nile's green jacket. She looks great but just ruined the overall aesthetic of the final act and couldn't take her seriously while doing the action sequences. Should have just worn it during the final dinner scene. But that's just me nitpicking. No big deal.Still hoping for a sequel with even more action and no more immortal characters please. The ones we have are enough.

While it doesn't offer much in the way of substance (in terms of characters, story, and world building) the action sequences and fight choreography make this a two hour thrill ride, though I wish it was a bit more over the top than it actually was.Overall I'd say you'll enjoy THE OLD GUARD even with three quarters worth of a bucket of popcorn.",The Old Guard

Looks like Part-II is in the offing.....Relax with this movie on a weekend, like I did, with pizza and popcorn....mmm....",The Old Guard
313,warren-87235,Enjoyable without being memorable,6,13 July 2020,"The premise is immediately intriguing, there's no denying that. Where The Old Guard fails, is in using its premise to any real effect. Overall, it's a fun but disposable action flick. Aside from the 'villain wants to use blood of immortals for scientific research' angle, this could have been any old action movie.I like Charlize Theron, and she's great in action roles such as Aeon Flux or Furiosa, but here, as Andromache, she feels as though she's sleep walking through events for the paycheque. I believe she is supposed to be _the_ Andromache, wife of Hector, which had the potential to make her a truly interesting character. Instead, the scriptwriter manages to make her somewhat boring, most likely in a misjudged attempt to keep her 'enigmatic'.Chiwetel Ejiofor as Copley ends up being the most interesting but underused character, though there is an implication he would have more to do in a sequel (if there is one). Beyond that, the rest of the cast are somewhat generic. Kiki Layne does what's required as Nile, but never really comes to life, though I think the script is more to blame than the actress. To top it all off, the main villain is terribly underwhelming. No offence to Harry Melling, but he was dreadfully miscast, though he can't be blamed for such a poorly written villain, either.One factor I found annoying in the script, is the rather pathetic way in which Adromache bemoans how all their battling for good hasn't made any difference. All while living in a world that, though _far_ from perfect, in terms of percentages of the population, has far fewer large scale wars, far less human cruelty, far fewer people living in drudgery and poverty than every before, not to mention advanced medicine that has helped billions... Certainly a far, far cry from the brutal world she came from, or even the more recent world-wars through which she has lived. It sets up an interesting moment for the conclusion, but unfortunately makes her character come over as rather pathetic and whiny. Emotionally, her character actually manages to come over as more immature and juvenile than the others!Overall, the movie gives off a high-quality TV production vibe, rather than what could have been a cinematic experience. Although no specific budget is yet known, the director quotes in an interview that it cost 10 times her previous movie, at $7 million. So we're likely talking somewhere in the $60-$70 million region. Quite frankly, this budget is _not_ on the screen. It's efficiently but by no means stylishly directed. For such a globe-trotting story, it somehow feels very confined and small scale.In terms of feeling like a TV production, the soundtrack is a prime example, with its frequent use of bland and innocuous 'songs' in place of a traditional score. It's a difficult thing to make work with an action movie, without feeling out-of-place and jarring. Oddly enough, a great example of making it work is Highlander, with its Queen soundtrack. Speaking of which...The obvious comparison to The Old Guard is Highlander. One of the key differences is that Highlander knows where our interest lies. The fact that MacCleod is immortal and can heal, isn't what truly matters. It's that those features allow the creation of a character who has experienced history. Someone who's lived through the best and worst of it, and how it shapes their perspective and life. _That's_ what makes Highlander work. We don't simply see the contemporary events. When we see his past, we get to experience the pain, the grief, the passage of history _with_ him. _That_ is what makes him such a compelling character. The immortality and healing are merely the devices that allow the character to exist.This is something The Old Guard clearly misses by a mile. Yes, we get a few brief glimpses of the past, but that's all they are. They reinforce a couple of story points, but do little otherwise. Instead, the 'healing' of these immortals is really all that matters, and honestly, that's not enough. Put it this way, if The Old Guard weren't 'old' and had simply been experiments from e.g. the Cold War, the film could be exactly the same. Now imagine making Connor MacCleod someone who's in his mid-thirties but with remarkable healing... The story falls apart... Perhaps that is an intentional difference with The Old Guard but, if so, it squanders the initial premise.It may sound as though I didn't enjoy The Old Guard, but I did. It's a fun action movie, and the premise can carry interest a long way, even if it ultimately feels unfulfilled. It's an enjoyable time-passer, but I doubt it will be remembered, unless it's as the setup for a potentially more interesting sequel.",The Old Guard
314,benighted2005,WHAT AN AWFUL EFFORT.,4,16 July 2020,"There was a time in this film where I thought it was doing amazing. Maybe half an hour in and it kept going well till about the first hour. And then I don't know what happened but the film took a complete jump. It went into laughable detours of times gone by, into over-acitng by characters, into introduction of new characters that made you wonder wait a second, is this person relevant to the plot? There is a sense of doom with some plot twists and so on and so forth. THE OLD} GUARD applies all the cliches. You can see all the follies of the direction unit by looking into the poor casting decisions made in the film. The only person who does justice to this film is Charlize Theron. Otherwise this film had nothing going for it. I felt bad for myself and wanted it to abruptly end. My purpose is not to simply berate the film makers - my purpose is to rant about losing my time and money. I say money because I pay Netflix a healthy sum and demand better direction.",The Old Guard
315,prhayhurst,Issues issues issues,3,14 July 2020,"I am sure in a few years or so, there will be a rebellion of sorts against these sort of SJW and woke movies, shoving their agenda down your throat, in a similar form as happened at the end of the 90's early 2000's, when offensively funny movies became very popular, off the back of a lot of PC censorship and activism happening.
Until then, we are left to endure stuff like this, female centric, gay couple, white bad guy, men subservient to woman, etc, tons of woke tick boxes that happens i almost every movie and tv show these days.
The action was quite good but the story was awful, as so many have said.
One thing early on, when everyone at her base realises the girl (Nile) isn't dead and her wound has healed, why on earth do they start treating her as an outcast? I thought, being American, they should be quite godly, and thought it was a miracle, not bannish her like Conner bleeding MacLeod! I was expecting one of them to say, she's got the devil in her lol

If you expect a humanity issue then this movie does not suit you because it is full of selfishness.
Lots of parts are not just added up.Good things about this movie are:
1. Clear goal, after 20 minutes you can know what they are after
2. Clear cause, after 30 minutes, you can guess why and who plots the heistBad things:
1. Too many irrelevant parts make the series too morose and dull
2. Some good-old-time lines just do not make any sense and show nothing.
3. Sounds/music do not fit at all.Seriously the concept is good and new and it is worthy of being developed into a series. Mysteries have not been solved. New members are still welcome. Old members are cunning and hiding. The last few minutes of the movie, which I think is the best part in the entire movie, shows the potential.",The Old Guard

Music is cringe-worthy (did somebody really think it was going to feel more ""modern"" if they put in trap/clubbing music that has nothing to do with the scenes? like we don't get intoxicated enough with this garbage on all channels and in all inappropriate life situations already?), the fighting is hovering somewhere around decent, but is pretty disappointing - too many times it felt like the enemies were purposely slow to move or just standing there waiting to get hit. The melee weapon vs. gun moments were especially hard to swallow, as the person with the gun should've prevailed easily. There are some very good hand-to-hand combat moments, but they kind of get drowned in many other lower-quality fights.But hey, good twist at the end - makes me want to see more.

The soundtrack seriously undermined the movie, and appeared to give it a strong made for TV feel. There were moments where, to cut costs I suppose, rather than have a wonderful scene steering bit of music to ramp up emotional intensity, and some degree of theme consistency, they placed crap pop music over the top to tell us how a character might be feeling during a particular moment - ""I feel so a(hhhh)lone! Lost and...."" - oh shut up! Things like that anyway.It could have been a marvelous 90 minute movie, had they chopped 30 mins out of it, and made some effort to hire a half decent composer. I've looked to see who it is, but other than a department, I can't find a name. Soundtrack by comittee, who knows? I wonder if they just had a grab bag of royalty free orchestral samples to cobble in, and when lacking something for a very specific feeling just went for any old cheap garbage pop to fill the void, something that wouldn't cost the earth, to tell us what we should be feeling in the moment. I can't shake that away - I'm quite shocked and stunned by their choices here.",The Old Guard

The idea of the movie is interesting and has some potential to be better.Its not the best film in the world and just sits in the meh.... category. Easy to watch without really worrying about it.The biggest thing that's lets it down which I've mentioned time and time again about films now a days, is the equality/political correctness. In fact its not just films its affecting computer games too. The producers/writers seem to be more worried about the correct balance of black, white, Asian, gay within the film. Surely when writing a film you think about storyline first and foremost. If you take the Joker or Pulp fiction two films from complete different times which are both fantastic films, the storylines have come first. The new Elton John film, Kill bill, Aliens, these are some examples of fantastic films with a mixture of lead actors from different genders and situations. The difference is it wasn't forced and was the story that was intended.The conclusion of this is films are getting rated inaccurately. Rate it on the film rather than the fact it has a female black gay lead for no reason.

It just happens and when that happens their minds connect in a way that is difficult to understand. I agree with those who say it was a movie with lost potential. Excellent special effects and action sequences, but little originality. Also, they want to put us the LGBT agenda again by the throat. I do not understand why the sexual preference of Joe and Nicky had to be so highlighted if in the end, it had nothing to do with the outcome of the story.

344,infoalwaysacritic,"Mediocre, run of the mill action movie with old tropes and new ropes",6,11 July 2020,"The Old Guard is filled with heavy handed agendas, decent action and an okay central plot to keep it moving. All around that plot are extensive character developments in a failed effort to enhance its mostly generic cast.Charlize Theron holds the cast together with a memorable performance, distinct character and a physicality she rarely shows. A handful of other characters are there to fill in the background, but it is unlikely you will remember more than one or two names, preferring instead to recognize the actor who played the part.The premise is as standard as they come - immoral big pharma wants to experiment on immortals to benefit humanity, but they want to do it in an evil way. Do the ends justify the means? That's pretty much as philosophical as the film gets when it isn't trotting out historical sins to paint organized religion in a negative light, naming crusades, witch-trials and even monologuing about the ignorance of organized religion. There are several scenes of the villainous characters being mean to same-sex partners (some explicitly stated, others implied), physically separating them, verbally accosting them and being generally very bad people. One might mistake the title of the film for referring to people of a certain mind-set or persuasion and not the immortals themselves.Many parallels exist in the film to suggest that the writers want to broach the topic of same-sex attraction as a major theme in the film. The Immortals only want to better the world, but people won't let them because they fear those that are different, who can't help who they are and subject them to lab testing to find out what makes them tick. This narrative undertone comes close to taking over the middle of the film, but fortunately doesn't prevent the film from getting back to its central plot, leading to a climactic and engaging final act with a handful of characters you will appreciate.Effects are on the whole decent on the characters themselves, plenty of bullet healings and the like. Background muddiness or hasty cells added in a foreground fall apart only rarely - I'm looking at you stock after effect of a water splash. As the cover would imply, there is a good deal of violence on people who cannot die, and those who can.All in all, a decent flick for fans of psuedo super-hero action movies with the classic immortal themes.",The Old Guard

356,Gorillaboi,You won't remember it after a few days,5,12 July 2020,"The premise is good and would probably be better suited as a TV series where the characters can be fleshed out a bit more. Instead, it's wasted on a very underwhelming movie with outdated tropes, action and soundtrack. Which shocks me at how they managed to attract someone like Charlize Theron who's on fire right now in action roles.My thoughts in the following departments:ACTION: Nothing fresh or innovative. Borrowed from Jon Wick and others alike. Exaggerated moves against dumb bad guys. Also the quick cuts and editing (along with a non-steady cam) make for difficult viewing.FILMING/EDITING: the over-use of the handheld camera affect is both needless and annoying. But I guess your eyes adjust to it after a while. Quick edits between cameras is also annoying.CHARACTERS: None of them even remotely interesting. They contribute to a lot of cringe dialogue. Performances (acting) below average too. The young girl, I'm sorry to say, is pretty annoying. Villain(s) are poor. Even the lead, Theron, is so-so - which is a shame since there is potential to flesh her character out a lot more (given the premise).SOUNDTACK/MUSIC: Terrible and won't age very well. At times felt misplaced. And too on the nose. For example, in a scene where someone is risking it all and fighting lots of enemies, do we really need a song in the backround repeating the lyrics ""I'm going down fiiiiiiighting, I'm going doing down fiiiiighting"". Come on, people.STORY: Quite predictable; finishing with a rushed, lazy ending that is more concerned with setting up a sequel.In conclusion, a very forgettable action movie which does not justify the hype and marketing it's received.",The Old Guard

358,ethantoy,Familiar Beats with Cliche Action,7,13 July 2020,"The Old Guard is a series about immortal soldiers; that's about all I can explain (considering I just now learned about this graphic novel series), and the film adaptation to me is decent at best. Most mainstream audiences will probably adore and love this movie, but for people who don't follow ""trendy"" things or care for what's popping in media, this movie is quite an underwhelming action film. Not because it's bad per say, but it's got underwhelming sequences that should already have been good from the start. It's got its set pieces and it's momentary drama added in, but most of it falls somewhat flat. Majority of the main cast are fairly decent, with Charlize Theron seeming to carry most of the potential on her back, but the other actors are less interesting. Again, not a bad movie. But it's not a John Wick or a Mad Max film, so you won't really get much out of this other than lore and entertainment from this.My only complaints is the script writing is cliche and niched to the point of eye-rolling, with some lines and some action scenes that are just way too overused in typical media these days- the same cutting images in action, the same overdramatic effects and super bland pace. It's just not a well-put together film in terms of action, and it's underwhelming to say the least. It's held back by these issues, and I can't help but feel that for such a cool concept, it's poorly executed in the way it should be portrayed.My appreciated moments is going to have to be Charlize Theron, who really crushes this role and makes it her own, and the great lore behind soldiers who won't die. It's a great universe, franchise and idea that can be translated into film perfectly if made by someone who knows how to do so. It's something Christopher Nolan could do or even Michael Bay (which is a bit of a stretch) but it's a great idea that just felt super limited, and incredibly paper-thin in execution.In all, I'd recommend this film to just about everyone. But if you're someone like me, where this is just another ""Top 10 Netflix"" contender, then give it one watch and move on- it's nothing unique other than the premise behind it.",The Old Guard

The Charlize Theron film is an adaptation of a graphic novel by Greg Rucka and Leandro Fernandez and is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.
The film is rated R mostly because of the violence and the blood and guts that fly about during those violent scenes. I never read the comics, but I did enjoy the film immensely. To me, it was a refreshingly original take on immortality and I look forward to the sequel. Yes, there will be a sequel, I am not sure when, but there will be one. The film is tightly edited and with action just around every corner.There is a lot more going on in this film that I will not go into so as not to create spoilers. But it is well worth the time spent during this pandemic to get introduced into a new action-packed adventure. And Charlize Theron is certainly a breath of fresh air.""The Old Guard"" on Netflix is rated R with a running time of 2h and 5m.",The Old Guard

368,c-m-f,just another B-movie,2,12 July 2020,"Hollywood is running out of ideas. It seems that every other film made these days is a comic book or graphic novel adaptation, and with the likes of Bloodshot and The Last Days Of American Crime, movie studios are really scraping the barrel. Today we have a Netflix movie called The Old Guard which, wait for it... is based on the comic of the same name... yawn. This particular adaptation stars Charlize Theron and Chiwetel Ejiofor alongside a gaggle of nobodies, resulting in a very dreary cast of characters. The blurb to this flick reads: ""Four undying warriors who've secretly protected humanity for centuries become targeted for their mysterious powers just as they discover a new immortal"". Sounds very Highlander-esque to me. The Old Guard isn't '80s cinematic Highlander however, it isn't even '90s TV show Highlander. This is an amateur-looking, bland, and unexciting slice of non-entertainment; basically, the dullest assembly of immortals since Twilight.",The Old Guard

in times long passed. each character has depth, and backstory, and the actors
portrays millennia of knowledge so subtly and with skill. the leads being strong women, the love interests being a gay couple, it's so progressively beautifully in a way that feels normal and yet somehow exceptional. the music is largely female artists as well, which is cool. even their fighting styles, are poetically personal to their character or relationships. even the juxtaposition of making an immortal character suddenly mortal, you are right back in the fear of them dying - it's a great tactic that this movie used. in so many ""immortal"" stories, you lose that fear and the story becomes banal. but to have such strength in ""will they actually wake up?"" or seeing andy walk into battle with the attitude of an immortal but the wound of a mortal.... that's magic.the devils in the details my friends. this movie has it. kudos to the script writer, and writer of the original source material. it's a rare. and it's beautiful.",The Old Guard
371,OneView,Life Without Consequence,7,15 July 2020,"THE OLD GUARD (2020)One of the more evocative film titles of recent years leads into a serious exploration of the curse and glory of immortality within the frame of a near-generic action film.Life without consequence seems to be part of the message here for characters enduring immortality. They live in a state of ennui barely able to perceive events beyond the circle of their day to day actions but continuing on and on because, what else is there?There are really only two central characters. The first, Andy, is played by Charlize Theron who approaches the role with a very tight, restrained performance, letting very little in emotionally and revealing very little. It might be seen as a passive performance but she gets away with a lot with her eyes.The second main character is Nile, played by Kiki Lane. Lane is new to me and faces a more difficult task than Theron as all her emotion needs to be on the surface. This is a character facing unimaginable stress in trying to both understand and live the impossible, lashing out in different ways and needing to use voice and body to communicate uncertainty. Lane manages to convey all that is needed effectively and this is a superior acting effort.The film does feature one significant horror scene where a character spends hundreds of years at the bottom of the ocean in a kind of iron maiden, drowning, coming to life, drowning again and suffering beyond measure. It haunted me as I watched it. It haunts me now.The action scenes are fine if a little low key - basic gun battles and close up throwing moves that would not look out of place in one of Steven Seagals's direct to DVD efforts. The music score is appalling, fighting against the intent of scenes rather than supporting them and all of the music choices feel wrong.I came to this one fairly cold and would have been unlikely to see it if it had a cinema release. I think this film is a good example of why cinema as a big screen concept really needs to die.",The Old Guard

To be fair to the storyline, the movies remains entertaining for a long period but ends in a disappointing way. The ending sequence is predictable and even lackluster with the climax action sequences.

375,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,Movie in Summary: Average,5,11 July 2020,"Charlize Theron kicking ass? You know I'm watching it! She is a certified badass and has solidified herself as one of the top female action stars in Hollywood. (Maybe I have a slight crush on her, but who doesn't?) The action sequences, although too few, were bloody good fun to watch. The movie had a great start and introduces us to some cool immortal lore, which I wish was expanded on. But it's set up for a sequel, so I guess we'll have to wait and see.On the other hand, the movie has poorly written, character-driven dialogue and made it hard to care about anyone besides Charlize Theron. The story is exactly what you expect it to be following familiar tropes with no real surprises. And what the hell was wrong with the music - completely wrong tone for this badass action movie. It was a fine movie to pass the time but doesn't ever meet its full potential.Recommended for: Fans of action movies, fans of comic book movies, or fans of Charlize Theron doing what she does best.",The Old Guard

The problem here is a lot of the small stuff. The soundtrack and score could have been a lot better. The villains were laughable, even though the base motivation made sense. The action isn't bad at times, but at other times it falls a bit flat - not every movie like this has to be John Wick, but a bit more more so would go a long way.I enjoyed this one, but mainly because I can see how the sequel could be a lot better in the right hands. And the cast seems up to it, as is the premise, so what's needed here is a a good writer and director. Here's hoping, give this one a shot to see what everyone is thinking.",The Old Guard

The villain is a bit melodramatic, but not outside the realm of possibility, and there were more chances for reflection (e.g. all the people they killed).

The comment on christianity was uncalled for, and the ending kept getting worse and worse because apperently they don't know how to end a story.
I titled this review that way because I was trying to compare it to something and a lot of the cliches that are present in The Old Guard are also present in 6 Underground, that wouldn't be bad (every piece of media uses plotpoints that could be seen as cliche) but, as stated in the title, a lot of the stakes are lost. This is almost imposible to avoid if you make the protagonist(s) immortal.-spoiler about the ending under this so please don't read further if you intend to watch it-I'd be angry if Charlize is in the next one (especially if she's immortal again), but I would also be angry if she isn't because she her acting is *chef's kiss* !!

If she is supposed to be emotionless; then it came through, but her monotone voice was awful.
The other immortals had personality, at least. Joe's description of his love for Nikko was very heartfelt.
The villain was pure comic book. He did everything but twirl a mustache. That was a disappointment.
Then as Charlize's Andy was losing her immortality, she seemed to regain it with no explanation. And is ready to continue fighting. It made no sense.

She kicks ass as Andy in this role just like she did as Furiosa in Mad Max Fury Road and Loraine in Atomic Blond. She really can bring it all in this type of role. Not just the violence and the stunts, which she does very very well. (WTF happened with Aeon Flux?) But also the brooding ain't got time for your drama leader / anti hero that doesn't show all her cards until the end. Her team of soldiers are great and I really enjoyed the first act with KiKi Layne as Nile the jarhead new recruit to the team and the whole team's back story / mission. After that it starts to disappoint. I expected more from the Chiwetel Ejiofor character Copley in what was a wasted role for him as he can bring so much more than what was shown. I get it that the main villian is supposed to be some evil Zuckerberg pyscho killer type but what we got was a just an unscary nerd with money, tech, and hired guns, albeit in a cool building where I would not mind living in London.

The directing style worked well in the action scenes, but the camera moves too much in the quietest moments. The pace of the narrative will not please everyone.

The film can't escape clichés, though, but few can.

425,barrelhousegutboy,Xena? Xena who?,8,11 July 2020,"I'm thinking the inspiration for this story looks a lot like part of my movie collection. About the only thing to dislike about this movie is that it wasn't released as a series so we can binge watch from start to finish. As it stands now its all primed for a sequel or several as a modern day Mod Squad of avenging angels. The action starts nearly right away as the movie opens setting up just enough to start building the sandwich without any questions. Then just as suddenly the ending I have been joking about for decades happens, 10 minutes into the movie and everyone is dead. Now that the director has got the audience completely silent staring at the screen; WTF? a few soundlessly mouth, before the movie starts in earnest. It's a betrayal for a prize straight from the epic of Gilgamesh. A few sequences aside the choreography is tight and well flowing, fire team tactics are well researched with a boost of teamwork interplay worthy of the Harlem Globetrotters. Some serious themes are nibbled at but nothing that sombers this very fun ride. If there isn't a sequel already in the works my guess is many hearts will be broken. If you like fast paced shoot 'em up style movies with indicated rather than realistic wound fx (meaning no gross chunks flying and firehosed blood baths) then this one has your name on it.

The basic premise about immortal warriors sounded really interesting but the story presented in this film about some pharmaceutical company and its lame CEO is rather lame. Hopefully, the indicated story for a sequel proves to be better.
The biggest selling point is Theron kicking ass and she really gets into it, as does the other cast members.

There are other things which happen and I won't detail because it will reveal spoilers, but its no surprise that someone else wants to know why there are immortals running around and they go out of their way to find out why.A lot has been said in other reviews about the PC, feminist, 'woke"" nature of the show, but I honestly don't care about any of those things except every time I hear someone use those buzz words, on both sides, it makes me cringe.
Some folks are hurt because they don't think a woman can be a badass, but they're perfectly alright with suspending disbelief concerning immortal people healing after getting shot in the head and other nonsense that occurs. This hypocrisy illustrates, to me the persons true feelings towards female humans. Its gross. get over yourself.I had lots of little nitpicks, like all the gun-fu fight choreography, but my main problem is that, while it had its moments in the beginning, the story felt contrived in that and we knew fairly early on, how it was going to end.

It all felt way too shallow. It would have worked better as a TV show.One thing I found really jarring was the contemporary soundtrack. Lots of UK R&B rather than a traditional orchestral soundtrack which would have added some feeling of emotion to what were seeing on screen.

I don't hate the idea, and in fact there's a lot they could do with it, and judging merely by one movie is a tall order given the world that Highlander created. But aside from the expanded firearm usage it fell fairly flat. They tweaked a couple of the rules, lost the tingle sense and the final game combativeness of the immortals, and dwelled forever on the philosophical horribleness that living forever (or even a few centuries) would actually bring upon people. That's the age-old question and Queen song - who wants to live forever? All in all the movie did some cliche action scenes and then brought in a new immortal and that was about it. They made the FBI into the Watchers toward the end. They set it up for a sequel, so we'll see if it takes off and has a chance to create a new world similar to that of the MacLeod's.",The Old Guard

And without spoiling too much, it also makes some of the decisions made by the characters hard to understand.

468,wentos,a slightly new take on the theme of superheroes,7,24 August 2020,"Was OK. I am a bit of tired of invincible characters having hardly any weak spots but this went a bit further then usually showing also what weak sides.
There were some really weak points like police arriving late after a major shootout and explosives - this did not contribute to story development and was just silly. I bought it in Eraser back in the 90ies so I accept it here too. Even some woke elements did not disturb me too much although there was too much of it to my liking. I guess main characters being what they are that is possibly borderline ok. Action scenes are standard fare today but you cannot do matrix sort of a show every year. All in all it was acceptable performance.
There were some weak points which could be ignored as mentioned above. There were some that were difficult to explain like behaviour ot main character in the plane.
The evil character could have been better. His lieutenant had really excellent role in serenity but here does not shine as much.
All in all a set of likeable characters, few plot holes but generally a nice touch to superheroes theme. The only thing I really found disturbing was the very ending after ending. I do not want to spoil so I leave it at that but this was really pathetic. It did not contribute to the main story so I still gave the movie a 7 for a general idea and likeable characters.
One thing which I disliked at the beginning and started to like later on was the main character being not very strongly built but it did fit the story perfectly as it seems.
EDIT: the wokeness in it still bothers me hours after finished watching. It is also definitely too long especially as some scenes have contributed nothing to the story and made it less believable instead.",The Old Guard

Though I cannot say more without ruining the film. I look forward to seeing where the story goes, so here's hoping for a part 2!The action is great, the acting is on par, and the cast seemed to truly connect and interact well with each other.

I get that this is trying to cover the origin story of these characters but it is too bad that instead of telling us in story form we couldn't see the history for ourselves. Imagine if, in Captain America- The First Avenger, the movie started with Steve Rodgers as Capt. A and we only learned how he became Capt. A through dialogue and some snippets of flashbacks. That's what we get here. It may be that the budget was blown with Ms. Theron's paycheck and the action set pieces, both of which were money well spent, but these characters have fantastic historical backstories and it was a shame to see them given such short shrift. My hope is that there will be a sequel or two that will rectify that.
I have to assume that the woman spending eternity drowning (and her built up anger) will be featured, as well. Frankly that is the scene I just can't shake, and it had nothing to do with the plot of this movie. This was good, it could have been fantastic.

Who cares? Not me. Does it do something for the plot, story, or character development? Of course not. There is no meaningful dialogue either. Nothing makes the viewer want to find out why these people have Wolverine's healing powers.Here is a tip for making a scene believable: When a crew of mercenaries gets shot down in an ambush and starts moving again in a room full of enemies, one will notice.

Maybe the producers should have hired a director who was more a fan of the genre than one intent on being profound.Charlize Theron gives it her all as do the rest of the immortals, with Kiki Layne (who was great in Beale Street) somewhat less convincing as an action hero.

The team at the centre of the story has a good mix of characters and allows some exploration of their backgrounds, so they're just that little bit less two dimensional than so many films.It's still an action film, but one which is just that bit different. Less male oriented, less stereotypical and with just that little extra that could make this the start to a cool series of films. Some truly fabulous choreography of the fight scenes, too!Well worth a watch and definitely something I hope will continue with a follow up. The ending of this film sets things up just too well to end here!",The Old Guard
487,vandalz,This is clearly NOT a ten star movie. Probably 7.5,10,15 July 2020,"The problem with IMDB ratings is that you have to over-rate movies to counter all the haters who stick a one-star rating on ANYTHING they don't like, or includes protagonists who are gay, Muslim, or a person of color. All the complaints of ""woke-ness"" in the one star reviews are more about the reviewer's motivation. When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you watch movies searching for ""leftist"" plot devices, you'll find them where they don't exist. This movie has no overtly political themes, yet some reviewers complained about them anyway.So... It's not a ten. It's also clearly not a one. It's competently filmed, the story-line is understandable, there are no huge plot holes, the protagonists aren't saved by a deus ex machina trope. Casting is adequate for the story, and most of the acting is at least workmanlike, if not Oscar-worthy. The source material, a graphic novel, is a trilogy, so expect two sequels, unless the second one tanks.Old Guard is no ""Black Panther"", but it's much, much better than truly bad movies like Jonah Hex.",The Old Guard

The acting in this movie is fairly good. Great to see Charlize Theron kicking ass! The movie has some emotional scenes mixed with some light, humorous moments. Decent character development with some good hand-to-hand combat scenes.What I didn't like -
Pretty stupid villain. The movie is pretty predictable. And like every Netflix original movie, they leave the ending to be open ended. It may or may not have a sequel depending on how it does.It's a decent one time watch.",The Old Guard

It had action, a unique plot, a suspenseful end that didn't feel like I was cheated out of a real ending, and great attention to detail. Lots of moments where I was like, ""Wow they didn't have to do that but they really went the extra mile.""Also Netflix loves to force race and genders into roles to make it seem more inclusive, but this time they managed to do so without it feeling forced in the slightest.

494,teacherianmitchell,"Worth a watch, but ...",6,1 August 2020,"This was fun, and something new to watch in lockdown. Should it be one of Netflix's most popular film commissions of all time? No. And here's why ...The movie was thrown a tonne of money at it, and while the source material is solid and Charlize Theron is as dependable as ever in the lead role, the screenplay and some supporting cast members fail to hit the mark.An engrossing concept: (near) immortal soldiers out to do good, yet constantly tortured by their own gift, but with pacing issues and a weakly cast villain, the movie can only go so far.Harry Melling, as billionaire nut-job Stephen Merrick, is simply put - quite annoying, and not menacing as the film's primary nemesis to Charlize's Andy. New recruit Nile, played by Kiki Lane, just lacks the gravitas to convince the viewer that she's the next badass in line to take over Theron's mantle.There are killer scenes in the film though, as Andy's squad take on various low-lives with fluidity and elegance that makes the fight scenes a pleasure to watch. But while these entertain, some of the dialogue between contorts the film into a less enjoyable romp.Chiwetel Ejiofor brings a level of class to rectify these issues and lends the whole film promise - perhaps this could be the start of something more appetising. It has so much promise, let's hope that this can lead on to greater things for the centuries-old group of mercenaries.",The Old Guard

Now to the title of this review. SPOILER ALERT. At the end of the movie, Andy punishes Booker for his betrayal with a 100 year banishment from the club, and rewards Copley with membership in the club regardless of his betrayal. Although Copley's motives were noble, his exposure of the immortals was for semi-selfish reasons. Booker's betrayal, on the other hand, was actually done to enable Andy to find a way to finally end it all in accordance with her expressed wishes. Both Copley and Booker ultimately redeem themselves, but Booker didn't deserve the harsh sentence. I'm sure it'll all be rectified in the sequel.",The Old Guard
497,dermacora1,It'll Pass the Time,6,10 July 2020,"Cool concept, but mostly falls flat. Would have been better as a series or mini-series, in my opinion. Checks some boxes for the SJW folks, so that should make that crowd happy (if that's even possible). Some things simply don't make sense and were a bit irritating; I think the screen writers simply took that route because there wouldn't have been enough time to explore those stories. For example, one of the big story points that weighs heavily on the main character could have been solved entirely with modern technology and unlimited wealth. I just don't buy what they've written in the script. Other things were clearly written as as easy ""out"" to either wrap things up or sweep plot-holes under the rug.
The soundtrack would have been better cutting out some of the licensed music and using more of the original score instead. Films that use music from licensed sources rarely age well, in my opinion.Overall, if you don't have anything else to watch and are good at switching off the critical thinking portion of your brain, you will probably mostly enjoy the film. There's some good action in here and pretty decent visuals, so it's not entirely a loss.",The Old Guard

You'd probably also be wealthy, extremely wise and know every trick in the book. The Old Guard are none of these things. They're nomads eeking out a living as mercenaries and, despite their years of experience, they don't actually seem to be that good at it as they're quite easily deceived and captured. The casting doesn't help, as none of The Old Guard are particularly muscular or look very tough or grizzled and then there's the plot holes: How come Nile hadn't noticed her body's healing abilities earlier in life when she grazed her elbow or cut her finger on a chopping block? Merrick's evil plan to harness their genetic abilities would have been dreamt up decades ago and despite London being one of the most surveilled cities on earth, the police only turn up 5 mins after the automatic gunfire has stopped - conveniently providing the team with ample time to escape.

I swear she was reading her lines from que cards off screen somewhere.The soundtrack is utter garbage.The story is plodding and ho hum.Our protagonists are allegedly immortal warriors who have existed for thousands of years and have fought on every major battlefront front since recorded history, yet still manage to be captured by mortals that they know are hunting them.They literally get caught sitting around watching the football. This is Lazy script writing in order to advance and already dubious plot.The villain is thoroughly detestable. But not in the enjoyable or formidable way. He's a mop haired ponce with no marketable skills as a villain.

502,Left_back,From small comic to small screen,8,14 July 2020,"The adaptation from comic to screen keeps many of the important relationships and beats, but throws in a major character twist and advanced a couple of plot points from the second volume of novels to provide a cliffhanger for the sequel.Being produced by Netflix gives the production a small screen movie feel, so viewers shouldn't expect blockbuster movie moments or sweeping vistas. The budget is smaller and choices of scripting and film location differ somewhat from the source material. The movie doesn't suffer much from this and the action and dialogue have been spread out equally amongst the characters which adds to the family feel of a long working team.The movie keeps the comic book feel, and indeed the author wrote the adaptation. Andy is the leader of a group of near immortal warriors who try and make a difference through all the conflicts throughout history, both known and unknown. The discovery of a newbie immortal is usually a momentous event which is almost lost in a battle with a CEO of a Big Pharma company who has discovered their secret.If you can concentrate on the story and the action, ignore the soundtrack (which is truly forgettable), you will be able to enjoy this particular gem.

Horrible horrible music (seriously, I'd always take a good score fitted perfectly to the screenplay over some generic piece of pop music with lyrics hammering into your head what the scene is obviously about). Some chliches and easy getaways for the plot, especially during the finale. Obviously set up as an origin story for an entire universe, so some plot points remain unresolved.",The Old Guard

Their role is a simple one, do bad things to bad people and once a new immortal is discovered in the Middle East the leader goes in search of the newest member of their team.
From there they face tough opposition from a Billionaire focussed on harnessing their immortality for his own gain.

Not this one, she is more convincing than ever. The moves she executes are impressive and believable. They fit the plot very well and make some of the philosophical questions stand out even more. The one I found central is the idea that someone with an unusual capability may not have the right to deny scientists the ability to study it for the benefit of all, or so they claim. Obviously it would also be very lucrative.I enjoyed the whole team that Charlize is engaged with though it seemed to be going out of its way to be socially relevant.

521,born-giantsfan,Charlize Shines as She Fights Her Way Through a Mediocre Movie,6,11 September 2020,"I like Charlize Theron movies - not all of them mind you but most of them. I find her to be a talented actress who has thrown herself into roles from the beginning of her career as an actress ... though in the case of her first real movie role (2 Day in The Valley) she was getting thrown in her role (against a wall). While not all her performances are top notch, she is certainly above average. But after her somewhat muted and wooden characters in Prometheus and Snow White and the Huntsman, I was concerned she was being typecast as the stoic (maybe evil) leader, a type of role I don't think she is particularly best suited for.So with her acting talents and her physical abilities I was keenly interested when she moved into the action movie genre with Atomic Blond. And while I enjoyed that movie and her acting, I found the action sequences poorly done - too many ""bad guys"" sort of standing there waiting to be shot/kicked/stabbed/punched like dazed punch drunk fighters instead of the trained officers or fighters they were supposed to be.With that in mind I anticipated The Old Guard that would once again feature Ms Theron. What I found was much improved action sequenced and very good acting by Charlize (and a couple others in the movie) surrounded by a hole filled plot line, a mediocre formula based script with half baked dialog, and a strange soundtrack (at times I liked it and at times I found it distracting).So on the positive side, the action sequenced have greatly improved over her prior movies and her acting was very good. Not sure if this is her training, the fact that she is now a producer and has more control, or they just hired better fight scene choreographers, but the fight sequences are defiantly more realistic looking. Charlize's portrayal of a worn out, tired, and fed up 3000 year warrior was very good. I truly saw her character vs Charlize playing a character (in contrast, in every Tom Cruise movie except Born On The Fourth of July I see Tom Cruise playing the character vs the character). I thought Kenzari and Marinelli were very good too. And the action sequences were spread out with attempts at story telling and character development, so it wasn't just another all-action movie.Outside of that there was minimal character development, stereotypical rich bad guys who are willing to kill and destroy to make more money, and plot holes that must have been opened up by Andy's axe. The interludes of story-telling between the action sequences had good intentions, but as the movie went on the dialog degraded and a few of the characters became more annoying and less believable. And did I mention the silly unbelievable bad guy in all this? Some of the biggest plot holes occurred towards the end of the movie, so I won't describe them here. Suffice to say that as the movie went on the increasing plot holes, degrading dialog, and dialed up annoyance of the clichéd bad guy (Merrick) turned an excellent first 60 minutes into an average 2 hours that just felt disappointing at the end.I hope the telegraphed sequel does a better job.",The Old Guard

Plus a series would give the cast a safer work environment during the pandemic staying working with the same cast and crew everyday instead of more travel and more crews increasing multiple exposures while the world waits for a safe vaccine. A series would also give the opportunity to A) give more back story of how those characters were chosen to be angel's/beings of good and also the opportunity to flesh out the story line and back story for all of the characters.

545,nrjsalodkar,Enjoyable,8,15 July 2020,"It appears from the trailers that this movie is an outright action flick. But it is not so. The main protagonist of the film and the others in the 'army' of immortals have lived for hundreds of years. They have seen plenty, they have known a lot. The film also explores this part, which is enjoyable.
It also deals with the moral grey area between individual freedom and the greater good of humanity. It deals with subjects like forced human experimentation, the immorality of humans, etc.
About the plot, it is decent and enjoyable. It is not akin to Nolan's thrillers.
The action sequences are well shot and reasonably enjoyable.
Music is incongruous with the film. It does not fit with the scenes. It could have been better.
I will wait eagerly for the sequel.",The Old Guard

552,pbratulis,Ok - another budget Netflix film,7,10 July 2020,I finally know why I find Netflix films cheap. It's the tinny - rather unfilmatic soundtrack. Nothing about the soundtrack to this film was either memorable or endearing. It's not a real film - more of a long pilot episode for a TV programme (and yes - this is how you really spell programme). That being said - it has it's moments but they all lack a bit punch. There is the gay relationship that's not really gay enough or a relationship. There is the virtue signalling cast.

I love Theron but she couldn't save this movie. They could have done so much more with this type of storyline and set-up but the movie is full of dull characters and the most cartoon villain ever from Big Pharma. This villain was so idiotic in every way and I wished someone would smack him every time he was on screen. Very predictable boring mess. The action wasn't even all that great compared to the other overrated Extraction movie with Thor. That movie still has the best action scenes for Netflix.

I disagree that the action scenes were average or badly done... I thought they were well staged, directed so that we could actually see what was happening, and more or less based on real combat rather than the usual spinning/ballet stuff we see.

We need more stories, more flashbacks, after all, they've lived for centuries and millennia - we need all that culture and history!I absolutely loved this. Although the plot is 100% predictable, and the action scenes are 'a second' too slow, the acting that shows the characters undying love for each other won me over. It's the small things, eating together, sleeping together, those pure and honest smiles they have for each other, and how they completely trust each other - it's all perfect and ideal. In a fleeting world, a group of friends who will never leave each other is something so miraculously wonderful, it makes one dream to have such companions.I still swoon over Joe and Nicky and still think about them from time to time. We need more of these two and more stories, a series please! I love how faithful it all is to the Comics, with the lines taken straight from the speech bubbles, even with the tiny screen changes. The last resolution actually complements the Comics story - that never gave a grand picture, and always focused on the never-ending tiny scenarios.It can be argued that as old people, they could have seen through the little twist, but I always though they are -Warriors- not schemers or philosophers, and for a warrior, Wisdom grows when you know Change and Death are inevitable... so what happens when these factors are gone?

576,RyanMatheson13,ENJOYABLE NETFLIX ORIGINAL - Technical Rating: 7.5/10 My Rating 7/10,8,5 August 2020,"The Old Guard
Released July 10th, 2020
Netflix OriginalThis graphic novel adapted Netflix Original has me undecided of whether or not I enjoyed this film or have I just been subjected to so many bad movies in 2020 that it was nice to watch something that wasn't a struggle to get through. There are many flaws to point off but there are allot of aspects of the film I did enjoy (or at least appreciated the attempt and intention) and so I scored it a bit higher than probably deserved.At just over 2 hours in runtime, I did expect some more action sequences and I guess I expected a little more precision from ""the team"" considering how long they've been doing ""what they think is right"". If you are unfamiliar with the synopsis of The Old Guard refer to the IMDb link attached but essentially the team in which I am referencing are a small group of covert mercenaries...oh and they're immortal! Charlize Theron as Andy, or the Boss is as always a likeable protagonist and as she has come to portray in other recent films (Mad Max Fury Road, Atomic Blonde) is perfect at playing the badass female lead. She is by far the best part of this film. The supporting cast is alright as well although I would have liked them to be a little more threshed out. I don't always particularly like flashback scenes in film but if they serve the purpose of building characterization and showing how these individuals met and grown over the years it may have given the audience more insight - and sub sequentially wanting us to care a bit more of what happens to them and why they do the things they do. I found the character of Copley played by super talented Chiwetel Ejiofor to be a bit cliché and again underdeveloped. For the high caliber level of actor he is he has very little screen time, and (I guess) a bit of a character arch where we see what his true intentions were in the third act of the film - but definitely a missed opportunity. And as far as our ""evil"" antagonist Merrick - I think we've seen this guy a hundred times before. At no point did I feel he or his assemble of bodyguards were ever a real threat to our lead characters. There are also some subtle biblical allegorical themes throughout the film too that I did actually like as part of the narrative but I won't get into them as to keep this a spoiler-free review.As far as the direction, narrative, and visuals - these are all fine as well. There's nothing spectacular that stands out although I did appreciate their attempt at some John Wick-esk choreography, even if he did fall flat. There is a fight scene though on a plane between two of our main characters that I did quite enjoy because I felt it set the tone for the rest of the film.And finally, because this is based on a graphic novel with four instalments and was picked up by Netflix (I don't think this is a major spoiler), as expected they do set this up for a sequel. This is a film that has become expected and routine from a Netflix Production - high quality production value, with high volume of viewership, and generally good to moderately good according to audiences and critics. Most recently films such as Extraction, Triple Frontier, Bright, & Michael Bay's latest 6 Underground. I didn't think any of these films were amazing - they all have their own separate flaws and missteps - but they do what Netflix intends them to do and that is entertain.Overall, The Old Guard is a more than likeable and watchable action adaption with great concepts and decent production design (although I found some of the music choices misplaced and distracting), and honestly wouldn't mind a sequel and an opportunity to learn more (allot more) about these characters. And I definitely find myself giving this probably a higher rating than deserved but 2020 has been a rough one.",The Old Guard

The cast is good and the acting isn't bad considering but the actors could have done somuch better with real dialogue and story.They got these 5 immortals who can fight and do stuff... they use them for... nothing. The entire premise is wasted. Most of the time they spend talking and ""acting"". Trying to make the movie deep and dramatic. But they still try and fill in with some ""epic"" fight scenes. While the fights look artsy which they were going for, they're a joke. They ALL look like a choreographed dance and .. in the literal sense. They arent super powers or super speed so why do the fights look like a high school theater rehearsal. Really makes you eye roll and takes you out of the moment.Predictability. It follows every cliche possible from the characters types to the story. Having never heard of this title or its books before, from thee very first flash back story telling boring talk time scene, you will predict extremely accurately what the second movie will be about. *eye roll*.Kinda Disney like at the start... where chars will randomly break out into (instead of song, a boring fight scene). Many plot holes... many ""why did they bring that massive thing to the fight and it never gets used or explained or does anything"". Why would they not kill that guy, he knows everything.... none of this makes any sense. Why would that guy do that to those people, he had zero motivation. There are multiple ""..... she couldnt breathe.. at the end...*tear*"" scenes that justify terrible dumb actions.Literally this could have been written by a grade 9 drama student. Horrible movie considering the budget and the cast. Definitely not accurately rated...I'd rather watch the highlander movie where they were aliens and society agreed to forget that movie ever happened.

I really enjoyed the movie. It keeps you going throughout and what I appreciate is the character development. Any movie which allows us to see how characters fit in is always a winner. You have to care about them for any movie to work right?
I thought the Old Guard writers did a good job not giving us everything up front. When the writers/producers/directors respect the viewer I believe makes for a better movie experience. They took their time to explain everything while intertwining a cool story.
WAY TOO many reviews here which are nonsense. Who cares about the music? Who watches a movie looking for ""naive moments""? Pay no mind.

The guys on here moaning about the score must have watched a different movie to me because the music choosen sets the movie off just right. The action sequences were nice and tight and, tbh, it's perfectly believable in what they pull off. These guys have killed with each other for centuries, of course they're spacial awareness and sequenicity are going to be bob on. Anyways give it a watch, you'll laugh.

The only good thing going for it is somehow they got Cherliz Therone on it, hooray for them. I am bored with bad quality coming from Netflix. I praised Stateless the other day as a memorable achievement by Netflix, but it is a rare achievement based on the general quality of movies coming from them.
as for the actual movie, as I said, I didn't even finish it. It is really a B rated movie. The script is messy and the acting is only partially good. The story is really just out there... but could work maybe if in the hands of a better production.",The Old Guard

Ugh. Everything mediocre here and as a person who is into sound department - that use of those preset alike pop/rnb songs in an action scenes... jesus, this is cringe 10/10.

649,enesdin,A Casual Netflix Movie,6,13 July 2020,"In the end, it is a low budget netflix movie. So, there are only a few characters and places in the movie. You can feel it from the beginning.There is a directorial problem on the action/fight scenes. The character on the focus changes all during all the action scenes. So, they had to cut scenes a billion times to change the pov over and over again. The plane scene was the most obvious scene you can see this problem. It is better with the action scenes which have multiple main characters appeared on.Another thing is they used height difference between Theron's character and Nile to give the sense of Andy is the boss. In fact, they are on the same height. Knowing/realizing (you can see this Andy and Nile's one on one scenes) that makes the character development much more simplistic than it actually is.Also, the issue with belief of God is nonsense with the complete idelogy of the movie. Andy tells Nile ""Apparently, you believe that illogic..."". Then, it gives the audience an expectation that they can't die or they ever will, but that it reveals that they can actually die. When it came to the question; When? The immortal character's explain that they die when their time come. So, they have a sense of belief to a superior power that gave them a holly mission and they can die when they are done with their part. So, it makes Andy's statement about a creator in the beginning becomes nonsense.Furthermore, the antagonist is just too weak and nonsense. Harry Welling is just great on his character. He did great, but they did not give him anything. He has a short screen-time and a bad script. Despite his stunning performance, you cannot even resolve his character when he died.As a conclusion, all of the characters were so indistinct. You can't make an emotional or logical bond with any of the characters. So, movie cannot make you want to keep watching.",The Old Guard
650,imdb-4912,Silly dialogue,5,10 July 2020,"The silly, unlikely dialogue bothers me in this movie.The main character starts off like a real Debbie Downer, feeling sad because the world ""is not getting better, it's getting worse"" despite all that she's doing. So she gets upset. ""The world can burn for all I care!""What an interesting and likeable character, eh? But we all know, of course, that she will change her tune and restore her faith in humanity before this is all over, don't we? So clichée...The things she talks about is philosophy on the level of a five-year old, unable to comprehend that small actions like helping rescue some kidnapped children didn't magically transform the whole world into a magical Paradise. Grow up and learn how stuff and people work.People are going to do bad things. I think that even a child can understand that. If she thinks that all people will just decide to be GOOD because she offs some dictator or whatever, she is delusional.No real person would talk or think like that. But a bad scipt writer could very well believe that it's an interesting perspective....Another example if the new immortal, when she finds out what's going on she goes ""I don't want this. Any of this. There's no good thing in any of this.""No? Really? Instant healing? Immortality?It's ridiculous. A real person would not react like that. But a person in a bad script would.And Copley having a sudden relevation and turning good. Unlikely. Silly. So clichée.Anyways. It was a good premise. Decent action.

667,keridb,"Great Concept, Missed Execution",6,22 July 2020,"Let's start with THE PROS:
(No Spoilers in this part)
The film is a fresh idea. Tho I know its based on literature, I haven't seen too many movies with this ""immoral"" concept.
Generally the acting is pretty good. Once again, Charlize gives nothing short, than her ALL. And does justice to a pragmatic, albeit somewhat tortured character. Most of the other casts acting comes across genuine. The ""new girl"" needs some work, but I see some promise for her future. The cinematography is pretty good. And the special effects were not bad. Overall the movie production is solid.THE CONS (Spoilers ahead)
The plot is not consistent. And tho I understand that they made Andi become vulnerable at the end to make her relatable, its inconsistencies with the literature felt to me to have an adverse likeability to Andi.
The betrayals were predictable. With Andi's naturally suspicious character, it felt like the 1st betrayal she just dropped the ball for the sole purpose of movie advancement. Had she been suspicious of a potential betrayal, then I feel the 2nd betrayal would be more believable.
As for the 2nd betrayal...this felt forced. Her teammate prattles on and on and on and on about his saddeness and feelings of lack of purpose; so he betrays them all....foooor what? BUT then at the end he's suddenly sad he gets kicked out & has to be alone?! Where was his worry of loneliness when he sold out his team?
I'm not going to even get in to the holes with her best friend who was imprisoned in a metal case but somehow gets out and then somehow just knows about the excommunication.There are too many inconsistencies to list. So in short...it comes down to, are you able to look past those & the plot holes to enjoy the movie simply as an action flick?
For me... yea, I enjoyed it. But its not making my re-watchable list.",The Old Guard

670,beavis_el_bunghole,Soulless heartless witless generic cheap visual junkfood,4,20 July 2020,"None of the one liners hit, the script is not written well or meaningful in any way, and we have seen most of the action before. This is detail flavorless odorless visual junkfood that has nothing to say. I'm sure we can thank Chinese production restrictions for this.The character motivations are razor thin and sometimes just inexplicable and annoying. The dialogue and ideas that are meant to be meaningful never are because they arent written well or thoughtful; they're all generic and you wont care at all for any of the endless cast of characters and their troubles. There are several action lines meant to be witty, but none of them resonate and you wont laugh even once.What are we supposed to be celebrating here? What is the point of watching this film? It's just an empty cold wasteland or pointless action that tries desperately to be The Highlander without understanding anything about the heart and soul of those characters and how to emotionally resonate with an audience or build any kind of unifying themes.Also, Charlize Theron is wafer thin and you will not for an instant buy the action she is selling, despite her boyish haircut and androgynous name and sense of style in this film. Alive for centuries, and never once learned to lift a weight.Please dont make a sequel. Use the money and talents for something better.",The Old Guard

But I'd put this as a close second.Everyone does a great job. While the basic plot isn't mysterious, it's a well put together movie that keeps you in it throughout,I love that there's some subtle comedy sprinkled in.

Not much use to save one human at the time, by such rescue missions, while you could have saved millions at the time by taking out corrupt world leaders, bankers and CEO's. I can't imagine that someone who lived that long, didn't come to that conclusion. But I guess the makers of the movie didn't wat to make that political statement, so they went this way.

Being an action movie, I didn't really expect intricate character development for the bad guys (although I think they did great in that department for the good guys) and I knew, given the premise, that I would need to suspend my disbelief at soem point or the other throughout the course of the movie.
But all in all, it's a very entertaining movie. I wasn't bored at any part nor distracted by character stupidity that is usually common in action movies but was thankfully subtracted from this one. The main cast is very charismatic and I honestly would watch the heck out of it if it was a TV show.

692,maldinibaresi,Entertains you... but doesn't stick with you,5,13 July 2020,"I didn't know anything about this movie before watching a interview with Thug Rose leading up to UFC 251 - suddenly Theron is part of the interview as she is a big MMA-fan.. So I gave the movie a shot. It was something quite different from what I thought...The title itself tells you something.. off course. Apart from that there are absolutely none surprises about the movie. The general plot looks like something you've seen multiple times before (with some nice traces back in history though) - I guessed what was going to happen quite quickly and I can see that other reviews also suggests that the writing could have benefitted from one or perhaps two re-writes.That said, I was entertained, as some of the characters are quite likeable; I like Ejiofors work in general, and Theron is just a good person so I do have a hard time giving her any harsh feedback - maybe this performance was a bit too Kate Beckinsale'ish - but agian: Charlize kicks major ass in her action sequences as we've seen in several films now!KiKi Layne is an exciting talent - do check her performances out in ""Captive State"" and ""If Beale Street Could Talk"".",The Old Guard

This is not one of those it's so bad it's good movies so don't waste your time.

But the entertainment industry is using principles as a gimmick its not to tell a story anymore. But its abused.
Its to cater to revenue.
The old guard isnt any different.
It feels like a cheap highlander with this time a female protagonist like so many other reboot types ( terminator , star wars and they are all OP which makes no sense with the lore)
That on its own isnt bad but do it in a respectfull way.-Character introductions and depth -3:
The protagonist doesnt seem in touch with her femininity but is grunty burdened unbalanced. Nothing that reflects old age wisdom.
Then the guys who are lovers... really? Was that brokeback mountain crap necessairy? And even so why not show their pain and struggle in having that and how it came to pass as this was worse than a sin back in their crusades islamic era.
There is 1 scene that shouldve been better flished out. As a memory where he states his feelings. That wss a decent chance but again rushed through.Writing level- 4
no flushed out characters no explanation only possible cynical way of viewing eternal life.
No wisdom beyond years was portrayed in their fighting skills nor their knowledge in strategy or wits and wealth.Actors casting lvl- 7 very good ensemble but the producers looked like somebody holding a machine gun for the first time with this cast

Unfortunately this backstory is only fragmented and within the short running time of the Movie just not very well handled,. Something for the sequel i guess, but a little more depth would have made this one definitely more enjoyable. While i liked the Chemistry of the ""Team"" and give Kudos to Chiwetel Ejiofor for his calm and collected performance, i was disappointed by the one dimensional bad guy, kind of like a dark Hobbit, and the whole hollow written and totally sucked out big bad Company thingy. And thats the other part : The writing is not original at all, so the story has no real drive at any point. Still, the Movie is entertaining enough to sit through it without getting bored to death (thats if the abysmal soundtrack and tracklist, somewhere between a bad 90s rave and a modern Disney Movie gone wrong dont make your ears bleed to much).

704,nsharath009,More of the same face-kicking from Charlize Theron but with international twist,7,10 July 2020,"There's always something exciting (and more than a little nerve-racking) about a director with a distinctive voice taking on a new film genre. Think Robert Altman doing noir with The Long Goodbye, or Terrence Malick making a war movie with The Thin Red Line. Or, more recently, Taika Waititi tackling a superhero flick with Thor: Ragnarok. So while Gina Prince-Bythewood, previously best known for the sublimely romantic Love & Basketball and Beyond the Lights, might not seem like the first choice for a comic-book movie about a group of immortal superheroes who've been fighting evil for centuries, just a few minutes into The Old Guard you realize what an inspired choice she turns out to be.And the scene that initially does it - I am not making this up - involves Charlize Theron guessing the provenance of a mysterious piece of baklava. Her character, Andy, once better known as Andromache of Scythia, has been around for about 6,000 years, having fought (and died, and come back) in hundreds and probably thousands of battles all over the world. Along the way, she has been worshipped as a god, burned as a witch, and hung out with Auguste Rodin. But right now, she sits with her small team of fellow ancient warriors (the other three have been around for merely hundreds of years) and plays a parlor game: They give her a piece of baklava; she has to use her eternity of experience to figure out where it's from. It's the kind of scene that would be an offhand moment in any other film or played for laughs. (Think the Avengers and their shawarma.) As directed by Prince-Bythewood, however, it's warm, observant, quiet - and hence immersive. For a minute or so, nothing else matters in the world other than Charlize Theron and that piece of baklava.Adapted by Greg Rucka, who created the original 2017 comic along with illustrator Leandro Fernández, The Old Guard is filled with such human moments, both frivolous and profound - quiet reveries, declarations of love, dreams about eternity, regrets over families and loves left behind and lost forever - and in the balance of the film, they hold equal weight with the action scenes, because ultimately everything feels connected.Everybody feels connected too. Unlike the standard superhero team, the Old Guard themselves seem less like a collection of traits and more like real people. There's a shared despair, largely unspoken, between Theron's Andy and Matthias Schoenaerts's Booker, a former Napoleonic army officer: Andy has seen so much loss in her many millennia, while Booker, relatively new to the immortality thing, is still working out his grief; somehow her numbness and his rawness land them both in the same uncomfortable place of wanting out of this life. Meanwhile, Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicolo (Luca Marinelli) are former combatants from the Crusades who are now lovers as well as brothers-in-arms, two men whose passion is fueled partly by the fact that, before they fell for each other, they killed each other over and over again. What an interesting idea that is! And how refreshing that the movie knows it and leans into it. All these characters really do feel as if they've known one another for centuries, with all the complexity - the bitterness and sacrifice and loyalty - that suggests. Into this team comes Nile (KiKi Layne), a young Marine who discovers her own immortality in Afghanistan and whose response to her strange new power is, at least at first, a combination of loneliness, confusion, and shame.When I profiled Prince-Bythewood recently, it became clear that the quality of being present in a scene lies at the heart of all her work. What makes Love & Basketball and Beyond the Lights so special isn't just their romanticism but their patience. The director's camera diligently observes her characters without rushing them along to the next big narrative or emotional climax. That kind of intimacy obviously comes in handy when you're telling a love story, but when it's transferred to the realm of comic books and superheroes, a different kind of alchemy occurs: A supernatural action fantasy starts to feel heartbreakingly real. So even though the plot of The Old Guard isn't particularly novel - a sociopathic young pharma bro (Harry Melling) with a small private army attempts to harvest our heroes' powers - we find ourselves deeply invested in their predicament, however by-the-numbers it may look on paper.That's not to suggest that The Old Guard doesn't also kick all sorts of ass in the ways it's supposed to. The combat has been creatively choreographed, and these men and women really do fight with the kind of speed, fluidity, and inventiveness you might expect from people who've been doing so for a long, long time, using cool weapons and cool martial-arts moves you shouldn't try at home but will probably want to. That the film never has to rely on choppy editing to cover up for bad action is an additional blessing. (It helps, of course, to have Theron, who has already proved herself an elegant cinematic bruiser with roles in Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde.) For all the film's brooding, it goes down easy. It's enormously fun, but it won't give you the kind of candy headache so many other superhero movies do nowadays.Speaking of which: In ordinary times, The Old Guard (which is produced by Netflix, though a theatrical release was always planned) would have opened in a crowded marketplace that had already seen titles like Wonder Woman 1984, Black Widow, a ninth Fast & Furious entry (also co-starring Theron), and The New Mutants. There are still plenty of pictures coming out, but since those big comic-book and comic-book-adjacent films have moved off the release schedule, The Old Guard now has an important corner of the market all to itself. Watching it, I don't miss those other movies with their shared universes and painstakingly built, vigilantly managed worlds. I watch The Old Guard and try to imagine a new world, one where other comic-book movies are this well made and breathtaking.",The Old Guard

Joe and Nicky are gay and dating each other while Booker is... uh... just Booker, I guess. For those characters, there's no more exploration into who they are. Nile was an interesting fish out of water character and could've provided an easy means of introducing the main cast to the audience, but when she's going to meet everyone for the first time, the movie immediately skips to the next scene where they've already met and go on about plot stuff again.Worst of all is the antagonist. He's is just as plain as they come, a generic business-owning millionaire who either only cares about money or saving lives. It seems like the writers can't decide between these two motivations so he bounces between them every other scene. He also is not explored at all and is not given any reason for his motivations. He's either just greedy for the sake of being greedy, or maybe wanting to save lives somehow.Now, all the negatives I have stated above account for a very small portion of the film and each can be easily fixed in the sequel (which is heavily implied might happen). Everything else about the movie is spectacular! The rest of the main characters are deeply explored through the concept of the film in a perfect meld of plot and people. Andy is a likable protagonist who the audience can connect with through her grief that we explore during the entire movie, and Nile feels relatable because she is just thrown into this world of killing, hunting, and mayhem without any prior knowledge. Much like the audience. The secondary villain's motivations are kept hidden until the ending and the writers create a very believable scene that helps us understand what motivates him. Plus, the presentation is immaculate. From the first 60 seconds, I was hooked and could tell this movie was not going to be your typical big-screen fare.All in all, this movie is nowhere near as bad as some are saying. It's a fun action-packed ride with some neat character moments (and a few forced ones, but those don't last long).",The Old Guard

Even one hour would have been boring.
Absolutely nothing happen in this movie. The music is, I don't know, out of context? Small pieces of hip hop and other stupid stuff just popping up regardless of what is going on in the movie. Sentences not fulfilled before cutting to other scenes. A lot of dialogue with no purpose. It's like a Superman movie, we spend the first 30 minutes learning about Supermans background, and then the movie explodes into action. Except in this one we only learn/listen for 2 hours and the 10 min. of action is worse than movies form the 80s.

The music made it worse, it does not sync with the scenes at all, and if anything made the movie feel cheaper. 4 stars because 1) Interesting premise (immortality etc.), 2) Charlize Theron, 3) Matthias Schoenaerts, 4) Good to feel hatred towards Dudley from Harry Potter again (he plays the villain).

It feels like they left half the movie on the editing table so nothing made sense. For starters, they where set up by people that knew about their immortality.

Following the characters' stories was well described, giving just enough detail to take you back hundreds of years but not enough to be an info dump of background. Phenomenal action scenes. Character arches professed smoothly. One part of the story line I did not like was that I caught on the ""the sell out"" character very early in. I was not impressed with several loop holes, not in the story line but in creating the film. One of which was too much telling the audience how the characters felt by writing it in the actors' lines instead of allowing the actor to portray it on film naturally. The end with Merrick was the final straw for me with the typical bad guy monologue when both girls clearly had the upper hand on him. But I will say that the twist at the VERY end, very good. Not the greatest film of the year, but I would want to see a sequel because of that ending.",The Old Guard

The way the Old Guard fought together, illustrating how long they have been at this, is yet another example of why fight choreography needs its own Oscar, just as dance choreography has.The story was fascinating, and held together from end to end, even as the action escalated.

The cast are in the main , unknowns and will be looking to put that they were in a moview ith theron on their CV I would immagine. The dialoge is forced and ponderous. The story line, well you know, there is what you could call a story there, but is fails to address gapping holes in the pretence. Like, how did they come to have these powers in the first place, since one of the group magically appears to gain the powers during the movie.

747,tilmanowl,Good at what it is,9,14 July 2020,"The promise of ageless immortal warriors is really cool, and this movie totally delivers on that. Overall, a solid movie. While I'm no expert on acting, I found that all the characters were played very well, and captured the ""feel"" of an ancient warrior or people who've been side-by-side for hundreds of years very well.The action sequences are absolutely delicious. Fantastic choreography, and they didn't feel like ""They fight""-type filler. Watching them, you really get the feeling that these people have been fighting for hundreds, or even thousands, of years and the action sequences are what make this movie so good.The music was hit-or-miss. Personally, I would've enjoyed something more in line with the theme of ancient warriors, or inspired by historical music. The extremely modern pop and rap didn't fit the tone all that well.The plot wasn't anything special but that didn't detract from the movie. If you're familiar with the superhero genre, this played out textbook including all the classic twists, an archetypal villain, and a hero's journey. Still, I didn't watch this (or go into it) expecting some masterful narrative journey, I watched it to be entertained, and I was.Special effects and setting were fine. I couldn't tell (like some other reviews state) that this was ""low budget"" and even if there were less-than-perfect elements, they didn't break my immersion into the story.The end sets up a sequel, and I'd gladly welcome one--however I'm not sure if movies are the right format to do so. There's a lot you can do with this concept and I think that they'd have more freedom to explore unique plots in a serialized format.",The Old Guard

So it's a nice change for a straight, white American woman to be doing it. However, in their rush to be diverse, the producers managed to make character with no depth at all - just a couple of light quips to make them appear witty when they just seemed as insincere as the production approach to inclusive cinema.But when you boil it down it still fits the synopsis; ""American leads band of misfits to defeat evil British guy"" which is a real shame as the whole immortality aspect gave scope to do so much more.Pros; It's a nice break from following around a gun-toting American MALE hero, and the American interpretations of what other countries look like don't fail to amuse.Cons; Very obvious plot devices, the diversity comes across as artificial and insincere at too many points, it's still Americans defeating British bad guys, predictable throughout, cliche dialog, unoriginal and over-choreographed action... oh, and Theron in the 2,000 years of flashbacks has an American accent throughout - go figure.To me, it also completely failed the test of being able to walk away from it and describe any of the characters by their personality.

The action was unique and very exciting. It was a fresh flavor amoungst the ever growing stale action flicks being produced. Additionally, their concept of having some immortals from ancient history was pretty darn awesome! Typically we see other movies with characters that are 100 or more years old (typically vampires) and yet they still look like they act the age of their actor, like a teenager still trying to find themselves (kinda like... twilight). These characters were a little more calm and slightly more believable for being so old. However, better scripting would have put a grand polishing on their characters that needed it desperately. Most of the lines were more stereotypical and not very different than we had heard before. This also goes for their general plot line, twists and turns that we could see coming but didn't predict because we thought the writers would have tried harder. Overall, I'd suggest watching this to get your action fix and for inspiration.

Shame the writers didn't know how to properly develop the premise of the story.Surprised this has a 76% on rotten tomatoes, but I guess that's probably due to the fact that the show clearly tries to be progressive by including gay, racially diverse, and ""strong female"" characters. As with most attempts at inclusivity in shows these days, it unfortunately feels pretty forced. 6/10",The Old Guard

2. Why they grow up to some point and then stop? Why they don't stay a teenage instead of adult?
3. If they are able to locate that navy soldier in Afghanistan why they weren't able to locate the one dropped in the water for hundreds of years?

I love that it's a woman led action movie with cool fight scenes, but I also love that it had depth. What do you do with immortality? Is it a gift or a curse? I'm glad it slowed down at times to have those conversations and make us care about the characters so when they're in cool, violent, action scenes we actually care whether they love, die, succeed, or fail. I wasn't as annoyed by the music as everyone else. I thought it fit the tone quite well actually since it was all filtered through Andy's POV who was depressed through most of the movie. Yes there was some cliche dialogue moments to get though which I expected because I've seen these kinds of supernatural shows and movies before and there's certain beats the writers have to hit: ""this can't be real! It's impossible!"" Etc. but it didn't bother me. That's simply how people would react to finding out they're immortal and can never see their families again. It can't really be skipped or even changed to something we haven't heard before 100 times. Oh well. It was still a really cool, badass movie and I hope to see more of it.",The Old Guard

Immortal soldiers, terrorism, gun fights and Hand combats. Sounds familiar? Well, it is. Most of the times when an action film takes itself too seriously, things doesn't work. The Old Guard does not take itself seriously and that's where the problem lies. It should have...
With a bit more detailed work on the Back stories (when you know that these are the people that have been alive from centuries you expect something different and unique) , it could have been a classic.
Instead it ends up being a clichéd Popcorn Action.
Which also works at some level because of two leading ladies. So, give it a try.

The writer of the script was smart to give us some keys about the life of the eternal guards and the past of them from many timelines but he didn't give us everything about them and their eternity in some part of films but the lines between the characters were good enough to be excited .The realation between Andy ""Charlize Theron"" and the new guard was very complicated and enjoyable to watch .The action scenes were good at many parts of film and some of them were excellent but they were lazy in some of them .Finally It was a nice experience with old guard and I enjoy it .I advise every one to watch the movie Best wishes bye .

The action scenes are like a B grade 90s scify movies and the music score is something you would expect in one of those teen scify shows on netflix.Its really a shame the director couldnt do a better job with an Oscar winner and a great story.Netflix in general has been making a lot of mediocre content recently. In the past it seemed like the network was focused on quality over quantity. Now they are releasing a lot of original content but the majority of it is mediocre or just plain bad. Pretty much akin to the twilight series. Netflix needs to aim higher.The movie ""Extraction"" was the exact opposite.

The fight scenes have beautiful John Wick-like choreography, the plot keeps you hooked with its mysterious twists and the characters are deep and interesting.The movie captures a certain feel that reminds me of the first Highlander movies. We understand that there are certain rules to how immortality works, but we do not fully comprehend all of them and have little clue of their purpose. Events that unfold during the characters journey make them understand some of the pieces to the great puzzle that make up their own immortality.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action-packed adventure movies with a supernatural plot. And as you can tell from several 1-star reviews here, if you are very homophobic (at one point two men kiss) and/or feel uneasy with female lead characters of which one is black consider watching something else.

820,scoey,Style and beauty...no substance,1,3 August 2020,"How do writers with no imagination sell work this horrible? Nepotism? Blackmail? There are a few...very few elements of the story which, had they explored them, might have made the psychotic blood lust of immortal beings slightly redeemable. Since zero stars is not an option, let that fact serve for the one I had to give it. It was a movie. They get a star.These immortals kill people who are, as one of them aptly put it, ""children"" to them like someone introduces themselves to guests at a crowded party. Obviously whatever gives them immortality gives them little intelligence and absolutely zero wisdom or conscience.While the current state of our culture requires ""action"" which really means ""mass murder"" to keep their attention, it's really the lowest common denominator. The subject of a human being who lives for more than 2,000 years could keep an audience's attention without murder as the main plot if the story were written by a truly creative, thoughtful, imaginative writer. That writer did not appear in the room after the focus group of idiots they hired for this movie's formula were asked what elements of an action story they'd like to see.Nothing about this movie is original. The elements it cannibalizes from other stories are hobbled together clumsily and without depth. Their attempts to express ""diversity"" in the cast are formulaic and not at all organic. Its nice they threw in some homely people to balance out the picture-perfect beautiful ones, but they still cast quite a few people whose main talent was on display in their head shots.This movies is a caricature of mindless, bloody, killing fantasies without a soul, and without anything at all to say that matters.",The Old Guard

824,falacta,"Netflix overlong pilot episode, not a movie (next Bright)",5,19 July 2020,"Action movie with Charlize Theron sounded cool, we know she can do action. The cast of characters is kind of doing okay, but you are thrown into a bigger story with parts I'd actually would have prefered as they were more interesting (immortal warriors through the ages).But the way it interjects with a shallow, generic main story (ruthless pharma CEO wants their genes for money) it just shows a jarring undercooked script.
There is tons of exposition with no rhyme or reason, the main story feels like it could have used a couple more rounds in the oven to make it tighter by removing frivolous parts, check the tone and make the dialogue tighter. The big reveals were muddled through and inconsequentialThere is also a problem that immortality immediately removes any tension because the ""good guys"" do not care if they get shot in the face. They tried several angles to deal with that, but that is kind of sabotaged by the characters not really acting like they take it serious (despite a backstory trying to indicate they consider a certain fate worse than death). So the action feels mediocre as well because there are few stakes in it.The last act kind of reveals that the goal of this movie was not to be an exciting action flick, but the pilot episode to a TV show.The actors do a decent jobs, the premise could be interesting, In the end this is a bland movie held down by this ""new cinema world of streaming"" approach of treating movies as test balloons for TV shows and when the numbers are right, we will do more/better.

828,sulona93,More than I expected,9,14 July 2020,"I was expecting an action movie. But what I got was so much more. The understanding of greed today is quite buntly depicted by the bad boy CEO. But it is in that bluntness, where the truth lies. Mankind wants to have more. It's not satisfied by completely destroying this earth and each other by war and pollution. But the highest reach of them all is immortality. Mankind wants to live forever, completely denying that the earth could never hold as many people, as it is already overcrowded. The complete negation of this is shown in this movie. And the other side shows the people who lived with humanity for so or too long. They have seen war, seen cruelty and have enough of it. They didn't choose their existence but have to live with it whether they want to or not. Although irrationally fantastic, reality lies in the fact, that we do know our past. We can learn or read about history and know our failings, know what has been and what we could do better. But a vast majority just wants to reach that greedy ultimate goal immortality as the highest act of dominating the kosmos.

832,berr-pragmatic,Bad reviews most probably due to not understanding the film,8,26 September 2020,"I watched the movie twice. In the second time I observed things which I missed in the first time. In the first watch, I had several whys; but the second watch answered them.The movie is not perfect, but definitely worth your time. The movie is good. Its idea is good. And I think they did the movie right.Definitely there is going to be a second part. And there is a high potential - based on the story - for Netflix to do it right.In order to understand some whys, here are some thoughts which might help:
They try as much as they can to avoid popularity and attention. They said it clearly, that the moment people know about their secret, the more hatred they would receive from people, particularly from the ones they love.Through out the movie, we were not shown how they normally lived, but rather their reaction of the exposure as someone has figured out their secret.The end of the movie put us in a hope to see in the second part much depth into them. I think this movie was just a nice introductory to the following part. And this is a kind of the common pattern of Netflix: See the first season of 'La casa de Papel' or 'Dark'.",The Old Guard

835,charlierobertryan-53164,"So much wasted potential, should have been a TV show",5,14 July 2020,"The Old Guard was so close to impressing me. This has got to be one of the most frustrating movies of 2020 so far, because there is too much holding it back for me to call it anything above average but there are some great and exceptional elements that not only help it stand out from other movies of it's sort but it makes me want to like it more than I do.I think it's biggest drawback is purely having to work around the mechanics of a feature length film which isn't always a bad thing but when your story has this much weight and covers so much ground, from the characters back stories, their place throughout history, as well as their relationships with one another as well as concepts such as how desensitised the characters have become to killing random people in order to survive, is living this long even worth it with having to cope with your loved ones dying around you? as well as the choices with how we live our life and what impact we can have on the world. I feel like a TV show would have given the filmmakers more time to develop all of these elements and give them the attention they diverse, but the movie moves at a quick pace that it gives no time for those interesting elements to breathe or flesh them out. As a result, everything feels so half baked.Which is a shame because when the characters are interacting with each other the actors have good chemistry, and they do a good job with giving you the impression that they have a long history together and i was looking forward to how the film would explore these things but instead it's mostly told through exposition and quick flashbacks that last a second and then were back to the generic plot and another action scene!Other problems with the film: I know I'm not the first person to say this but the soundtrack choices where abysmal! I don't understand this recent trend to pander to zoomers by playing some inappropriate dubstep electronic music that is so out of place and takes you out of each action scene it plays in! Even worse by the fact the action scenes by the standard of most modern action movies are actually pretty well done but you can't appreciate them due to the awful music that plays over it!The villain is probably the worst movie villain I've seen in a long time! There is not a single thing about him that's threatening, his bug eyed expression and over the top accent makes it hard to take him seriously, made worse by the fact that he has literally zero motivation for why he does what he does other than the fact that he is a smiley billionaire that loves money! If your going to have your world and characters be presented in a way that's serious, dour and dark you can't follow it up by having a villain who is the complete opposite to those things and looks like he's walked out of a Saturday morning cartoon, It would have been way better to have Chiwetel Ejiofor as the bad guy cause at least it would have provided some grey area to what he was doing. Also without spoiling anything but that sequel bait ending was sooo forced!!!So yeah a mixed bag overall (even though this review sounds very negative) If they make a sequel to this (which i doubt) I would probably welcome it so long as the filmmakers take notes about what to improve because this movie had potential and had it's moments so lets hope they build on improving the flaws of this film.",The Old Guard

849,duffestates,Loved,10,20 July 2021,"I absolutely enjoyed this movie. Most times I don't end up watching many movies twice but, I have watched it over and over with the attempt to make sure I didn't miss anything. Hope they come out with a sequel.",The Old Guard
850,cianabutler,A fun movie that has potential to be the next big thing.,9,10 July 2020,"On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie is a 9.6. There is room to improve but overall it hits really well. The actors for the main cast were great. I love the feel of their dynamic. They each play well off each other making them seem like a family. Also the addition of Nile (Kiki Layne) works really well. She fits easily into the already established group. With the introduction of her into the movie, we were learning alongside her about the ""immortal warriors"".
Additionally, Nicky (Luca marinelli) and Joe(Marwan Kenzari) were one of my favorite parts of the movie. Their relationship felt sweet, humorous and loving to watch. Joe's commentary is hilarious throughout the movie while Nicolo/Nicky's calm and sympathetic demeanor balances him out. However, I do wish we could have learned more about them and their lives separately from each other. Nick especially since I felt he was heard less than the other characters. I guess I could say that for the whole cast. Hopefully, we see more of that in the sequel.
Now the reason I didn't give this movie a perfect 10 is because I felt there were too many wide shots leading to the film feeling a bit flat to me.I think the cinematographer could of maybe played around more with different angle shots, color, and/or saturation. I was yearning for more depth and contrast between scenes.Overall, this is a fun movie to watch. The idea of ""immortal warriors"" is an interesting idea that almost anyone can be intrigued by. Also the fighting scenes are really another place were this film shines. I loved the fast tempo of the moves. All of Andy's (Charlize Theron) one of one fighting scenes with others were great.",The Old Guard
851,websignupforjohnny,What's up with the skin blurring efx?????,6,10 July 2020,"I am a third of the way through this movie. I can't but help notice that nearly all the actors have skin blurring on their foreheads or their cheeks. Why? Is this to make Charlize Theron seem younger than she is? I think so. It is irritating.Look at her face at around 47:40, where she looks up with her left hand near her face. Her eyes are razor sharp, her forehead, cheeks, chin, and neck are blurred out. If this were Photoshop, I would have to give the edit a 1 on a scale of 10. Very poorly done.I could have made a finer detailed more high def movie using my smart phone. Getting tired of these unnecessary special effects. I'm not an idiot, and I notice these enhancements. It is very distracting. Either stop the blurring or replace her with a CGI character.",The Old Guard
852,waremaker,Can't Wait for Part 2,9,12 July 2020,Charlize Theron is fantastic in this film. Enjoyed every second of this film. Great acting and fighting sequences were superb. Would love to see the sequel on this one.,The Old Guard
853,catRsilver,Yes Please to Female Leads!,8,17 July 2020,"An action movie with an original plotline and female leads, this is what you find in the movie The Old Guard.Andy and a group of immortals in today's age, discover one more of their type. When people start asking questions about them, they are forced to fight.Having two female protagonists is refreshing, especially in an action movie. Even though all other main characters are male, it does not take away from the power and strength of women.As warned, it had strong violent content, including guns, knives, fighting, axes, swords, and a lot of blood. It could have done with a bit less but it is still manageable.The movie has excellent cinematography. Camera angles made sense and the use of colour or lack thereof is appropriate to the context.The movie ends with a clear indication of a sequel, showcasing another strong female character. We look forward to the next!",The Old Guard

855,Mr_Yellow7,A clever take on a concept seen before.,5,20 July 2020,"Going into this movie I was slightly optimistic, however as it progressed you begin to see the cracks that ultimately make this movie average at best. The character development is shallow for a film that is 2 hours long. Like most I found it quite boring for being an ""action"" film. The amount of fight scenes could be counted on one hand. Paired with the fact that the villain was poorly written, it makes for a less than enjoyable experience.
I would have loved to have seen more of Charlize' characters past explored, or any of them really.
As such I would recommend this to anyone that would like something to turn their brain off and watch for a few hours.",The Old Guard
856,delizandre-76745,Amazing,10,25 July 2020,"I love these types of movies with human super powers. Hopefully they can make a sequel soon. Usually when I see a movie that is 2 or more hours I get bored or distracted easily, this movie kept my attention.",The Old Guard

859,vipjerry,Horrible mess,3,17 August 2020,"It's hard to tell whats is worse music, set design, plot or acting. This movie isn't even on Youtube high school level. I can't understand how somewhat solid actors can agree to participate in such a disaster of movie. Even my teenagers didn't want to watch it till the end. Bad acting, horrible plot, ridiculous boring dialogues and super cheap production - all in one. Strange that during the filming someone didn't notice that this going to be disaster and decided to turn everything into some kind of joke or comedy. In that case, it might be somewhat interesting but now its just sad waste of time.",The Old Guard
860,robertasburyrussell,"OMG, She's Got a Battle Axe!",8,11 July 2020,"Charlize Theron once again channels that Furiosa vibe as the 4000 year old, battle-axe wielding leader of a team of immortal soldiers. The action is well-directed and the movie could just sail by on those merits alone, but director Gina Prince-Bywood and writer Greg Rukka (upon whose comics the film is based) provide a believable undercurrent of emotional depth in the connecting scenes. This is especially true of the chemistry between Joe and Nicky. The finale is open-ended enough that a sequel has to already be in the works.",The Old Guard
861,blackpian0,Episode not movie,6,18 July 2020,"I had a nice time watching this movie, however I expected more as far as the story was concerned. The material was really interesting and the characters could be developed immensely. I really wanted to learn more about them and their past adventures. It was like getting a small taste, like a pilot of a new series and then... it ended, with a cliffhanger no less.
They should have made a series or a miniseries with this idea. It would be much much more preferable.
It saddened me.",The Old Guard

865,micahspayer,"Potential is the word of the day, boys and girls.",7,13 July 2020,"This film had it.
Still kinda does, in a deeper sense of the review.
But here's what this film does.
It's shot like a TV show.
Lots of wide shots mixed with medium shots. It fails to suck us into the characters which is a little bit of a mis-fire because there are beautiful cinematic actors in this one.
It takes itself a little too seriously. It's a good story, still works.
The music composer feels timid. The music and SFX, compared to the potential of the level this movie could've sat at, felt like a bowl of warm soup. WITH BARELY ANY BREAD TO SHOVE IT DOWN WITH. Let's punch it.
C.Theron is a perfect candidate for this, but she felt held back by script.
The style didn't land. Perhaps it remained safe because of a producer's order? Who knows. But if this saga continues, the production team should trust the instinct to get nuts. I have an open schedule to march the saga into disco island.",The Old Guard

867,ehudmi1,A total waste of time,1,11 July 2020,"Cringe worthy.
Nothing but old cliches of immortality themed action movies along the history of movie making.
Charlize will want to forget this as it offers her most lackluster performance. Totally wooden.
I haven't read the comics but if this is true to the comics than the comics is garbage as well.
I am so desperately yearning for more original thought provoking sci-fi/fantasy but I am truly afraid that today we have forgotten to dream new dreams and can only rehash the precedent dreams and nightmares of others...",The Old Guard
868,hongsc,An action movie?,5,12 July 2020,"I went in not knowing what expect aside from it being an action movie. Within the first 5 to 10 minutes, all the main characters are dead. But then I see bullets coming out from their heads and such. Well, now this is interesting. They use hand guns, assault rifles, and medieval weapons. Yes they went old school with swords and a some type of religious symbol looking axe helmed by Charlize Theron. That's best action sequence in the movie. The rest is all talk about being immortals, feelings, past companions (There's actually a cool backstory to a past female companion that should have been utilized in the movie more.), and they discover a new immortal. To prove she's an immortal Theron kills her again. Then mentions that you can heal then you stop and die eventually. Well if a cat has nine lives. They end up in a remote area that's been abandoned for decades then their location is all of sudden infiltrated. One of the immortals is left with his insides torn out or bloodied because he wanted to make it less obvious. Theron finds him tortured and left for ""dead."" Of course there's an evil pharma bro that wants to use them to make billions by making a miracle drug. The man that betrayed at the beginning is spared at the end. And what you're left with is wasted talent and a narrative that should have been satisfying, thought provoking, and engaging. There was so much potential to make a great movie and we end with this.",The Old Guard

I do understand that they were focusing more on the human aspect of it and being immortal and the problems facing it.

Pace was great and I actually loved the quirky soundtrack.All characters were interesting and developed in a realistic way. I liked how they appeared like no super heroes, just humans with a very, very long life.The little details: Freeman getting ready and tense as the elevator goes up to the 15th floor, Andy's centuries old ""stuff"" in the old mine, the baklava taste, Booker's story, were welcome pauses from the violence - packed scenes. They managed to make the characters relatable and add meaning to the story.1-1 fighting was choreographed beautifully, even though some scenes felt cliché.I was hoping for a more layered villain, just for balance. The 5 were not pure good so why would he be pure evil? (""to save humanity"" doesn't count, it felt so rushed).All in all, a good movie to watch and a bit different, more human, than most ""supernatural "" action movies, too.",The Old Guard

While it's not quite ""Atomic Blonde"", she does carry the movie. The first 30 minutes seem seductive - leading one to buy into an intriguing concept, yet many of the twists and turns were all too predictable. Classic good guys vs. bad guy. Some sequences felt cheap, while others were excellent. At midpoint, the backstory felt uninspiring and dull.

878,erikmsandreid,"Expected mediocrity, was pleasantly surprised.",7,28 December 2020,"Only reason I gave it a watch, was because of Chalize Theron (Going by actors/actresses is not something I usually do). Checked the score here on ImdB, and based on that, didn't expect much, besides a silly supernatural action movie.Loved the concept, the characters (besides the ridiculous and cartoony badguy), the music. The way the characters were felt REAL, as if it was actual people who had lived to centuries if not millenia. It's so rare for movies to get that right, so big respect for that - Especially loved Theron's character, as it was very realistic and exactly what you would expect for someone who have tried to better the world for maybe thousands of years, but all in vain.The movie isn't perfect though, as some moments annoyed me - Like the ""Wait for the signal!"", ""What is the signal?"" *BIG EXPLOSION* ""Oh, that is the signal!"". Me: Big facepalm.The badguy also needs his own little rant, as he is just so out of place in this movie, that is really confusing me, honestly. In one second, he is really sadistic, and only care about getting rich, and in the next he talks about ending suffering and saving humanity - Pick a lane and stick with it, mate... Also, I feel he was really miscast for this role. Don't remember the actor's name, but honestly haven't seen him in any role that I like so far.If the badguy had been less cartoonish, more sympathetic and nuanced, I would had given this an 8/10, but alas it wasn't so, sadly.

Stunts are great, for people who aren't fond of slow -paced movies, i think this movie wont bore you. Charlize Theron did so well.

The Old Guard delivers fun, action and excitement. And the plot is pretty unique as well. A well respected cast delivers each character very well.

He was complete horsepucky - he couldn't act- trying so damn hard to be a Ramsey Bolton- but came up as a limp half baked try-hard c grade actor.
However, in saying that. The rest of the cast was amazing and the story backs the comics really well.

The Old Guard takes this in the opposite direction, giving us well build and interesting characters with some slick action mixed in. It's issue isn't that what it does is bad, it's that it tries to be what it isn't.
It's a spectacular action film that tries to be a high concept superhero film and suffers for it, becoming only a very good action film by inheriting the flaws of the genre its trying to intimidate.A nice diverse cast, really, really good gay rep, some... interesting music choices, a villain that totally did not fit the film at all and just looked silly and out of place, great action choreography, pacing was a bit off at times but fine overall, and it wasn't all that visually striking excluding the action sequences.Def watch it, even if it's only for the action and gay rep.

900,mbboka,(I)mortal,8,20 July 2020,"Charlize Theron and KiKi Layne bring us performances of characters so strong that it is remarkably interesting to see their presence in the film. In all their scenes they manage to bring strength, leadership and even sensitivity, showing their humanity, and their concern to maintain that humanity even considering their abilities. The characters are not necessarily innovative, the type of ""hero's journey"" story has been done over and over again. This can leave the tone of the film cliché, but I believe that this production does not try to focus on this factor necessarily.The Old Guard is what appears to be an introduction to the group, showing the strengths of each character as well as their weaknesses, their complexity, bringing discussions that could currently be considered clichés or even unnecessary, leaving some doubts about the past of their characters and the limitation of their powers, which leaves opening for a sequence and expansion of the world in which they live, and with great action scenes capable of entertaining anyone.",The Old Guard

I liked that rather than leaning on quippiness, the non-action scenes relied on real human emotion. I also liked that it didn't get preachy. The characters use their immortality to try to help people where other folks can't, but they don't give grandiose speeches about it. It's just what they do. Even the unexpected consequences of their actions isn't presented in a preachy way. It's just really cool.The issues some of the characters experienced are exactly the issues you'd expect an immortal to have. I loved the various ways we saw how the characters pop up in history. (And, for a history buff like me, the way they did it made sense.) The action scenes were a blast too! I loved that the characters used both modern weapons and, in some cases, versions of weapons they'd probably used for centuries.

He is the head of a pharmaceutical company, and wants to find out why the immortals are immortal so he can spread immortality to everyone. That's a good thing! Yet the film makes him a cartoon villain in order to attack ""big pharma"". Why? He's trying to help the world.The film is needlessly anti-capitalist. It implies that making money is bad even if you're making a product that will vastly improve people's lives. It would have been better if Merrick succeeds in making others immortal, and that leads to a host of dilemmas (the world's population expanding unsustainably, or evil people finding the secret to immortality).But by attacking capitalism, the film is supporting an elite aristocracy of immortals and arguing against the majority of people having the technology to improve their lives. That lets the whole film down for me, because I can't get excited for the protagonists when the antagonist is trying to do the right thing.",The Old Guard

Color me surprised that I actually liked it. The story is very interesting and except for the somewhat cheesy bad guy (the reason for the 8 instead of a 10), the acting is good. To the reviewers who complained about the music, you are those people who are no fun at parties. You were just looking for something to complain about. It is a fun movie and I hope they make the sequel.",The Old Guard

Yes there are female leads and yes two men kiss (it's not even open mouth), and yes the bad guys are white but not all of them.It had a good mixture of cultures and races in it; good and evil.

2- I LOVE Charlize Theron, but because she directed the movie there was a HUGE zoom on her that it made me feel that a 70M$ movie was made just for her, other actors and actresses didn't get a chance to shine.
3- the moves were so fake and choreographed. they were trained to fight but just moves that they knew they will use in the movie.
4-the screenplay was lame.it feels like the actors are reading the lines like a robot.+:

915,simonparkinson-54745,I joined imdb just for this movie,1,14 December 2020,"I am not sure where to start with this film, it is so amateurish in nearly all aspects.Firstly this must one of the directors first ever films or at least there first ever action film, the shot choices were so poor, the pacing of the film was horrendous, the cliche character development etc just an all round poor job, hopefully the director learns from this monstrosity and redeems themselves in the future.Secondly, the soundtrack, my god the soundtrack, seriously how did this person ever get a job? The music choices all the way through were awful, the music never suited the scene, was completely at odds with what was happening etcThirdly the dialogue, if they make a sequel to this God awful crap please hire some other people to write the script, clichéd predictable snorfest.Fourthly, I predictive everything that would happen in this movie within 15 minutes of the film starting, because it is just another ""hollywood"" copy and paste story, there was source material to use but somehow we made this into a terrible version of the highlander but without any charm or character.The antagonist of the film, wow, what to say about him? One of the worst over the top but at the same time weakest performances I have seen in a movie in a long long long time.Last point, the action scenes, they could of been good, they were close to been good, but then the crappy lighting, the changing of the camera angles, the showing a camera from the right, then switching it to the left after the impact makes the viewer lost as to what just happened, just go watch any Asian action movie with a separate action director for how these scenes should be shot. This isn't the 90s, the game has changed.Overall don't waste your time with this whiney, tear filled nonsense that can not be saved with a normally talented cast.",The Old Guard

924,maritze,High-Blander: The Blanding,4,13 July 2020,"This feels like a bland TV series reboot of The Highlander franchise. Its a low key, low budget movie that seems to un-ironically think it can compete with the big guns in the superhero game. A little humour may have helped lighten things up a little.If the movie had a more dynamic visual identity, or more creative camera work it may have added some interest, but for the most part the movie feels like a low budget Nic Cage actioner. So it is surprising to see A-lister Charlize Theron not only as star but also producer. Seems even her presence could not muster enough of a budget to up the production value or entice a more accomplished director to sign on.Theron herself gives a strangely inert performance. Her features are set into a single marble like expression through much of the film. The audience hardly ever get any significant insight into her character. It's mostly through other characters talking about her (while the beautifully broods just offscreen) that we find out some bits and pieces about what makes her tick. This second hand character development is not involving enough to keep the audience involved.There are a few narrative beats that keep this films heart, if not beating exactly, then at least give the occasional spasm of life. But only just, as these points of interest are few and far between. The stronger story beats are between two supporting characters and most of the more interesting narrative points are bundled in toward the end of act two. Way to late to be of interest. Sadly there's not all that much to make things really intriguing and except for the fight scenes there is very little entertainment value to be had. Though even the action scenes are all pretty much old hat for anyone who has seen a couple of John Wicks, or even Underworld movies.Maybe this is where the Highlander franchise would have gone if they kept making uninspired sequels.",The Old Guard

The plot story is extremely banal and predictable. How come a normal bad guy can fight five six deadpools. I mean you can destroy deadpool too but these people i dont know. The actions are too artistics. I dont think you can fight that way in real world. I mean even Jhon Wick is artistic. But this one is too much. however, these people are not afraid of death and pain so they can be artistic while they are fighting. Overall the dialogue is okay, camera work okay, fighting balance totally imbalance. I am not impressed, not amazed. I just stopped half way on my entertainment.",The Old Guard

928,josef654,Missed potential,6,10 July 2020,"This one had a lot of potential. It had an intriguing and somewhat original concept, a couple of good actors and some nice action scenes that are reminiscent of the ones in the John Wick franchise in terms of choreography, altough at times paired with some questionable choice of music.
The movie also has a good flow and it hardly ever felt dull, altough an additional action scene or two sprinkled throughout the middle section of the movie wouldn't have hurt in my opinion.For these reasons i'd gladly give the film an 8/10. Unfortunately it has some major flaws related to wokeness that deduct 2 points from me. First of there are 2 gay male characters in the movie whom has barely any personality beyond their sexual orientation. That one of them delivered one of the cringiest speeches i've heard in a long time didn't help neither. Secondly there is a rediculous scene in Afghanistan in which it appears like the entirety of the U.S Marine Corps consists of women. There are some other examples too, such as a female leader of the group, but it was justifiable by context(her being the oldest) and didn't bother me. In fact wokeness when done subtle or when making sense through context hardly ever do. Unfortunately it wasn't the case here.Could have been very good but ended up just being good. Still, i'd recommend it in lack of something better to watch.",The Old Guard

I actually detest them. This isn't the usual mindless childish action or superhero film though. The heroes aren't cocky despite being immortal. The acting is natural and emotional and not over the top. I found myself tearing up at some of the scenes and also getting all excited at the action scenes. It's not cheesy or cliche.

I only have a few criticisms but one big one; the style. This sits comfortably in a middling style, not too gritty and realistic and not too outrageous. However considering the subject matter I would have preferred a heavily stylised film, rather than playing it safe.The other bug bear was the bad guys. Chiwetel ejiofor's 'Copley' would have been believable if we had a bit more back story regarding his wife; possibly lost on the cutting room floor. However even with this he knows the good that the group, particularly Andy, have done over the century's but is still happy to hand them over to big pharma?! I would have preferred for his character to have turned on Merrick, an absurdly nerdy Harry Welling, as soon as he realised he wanted to lock them up and throw away the key.If all this film does is inspire me to check out the novels then it's does a good job.",The Old Guard
945,keenanstarr,😒 I had the audacity to be excited about this...,3,11 July 2020,"I've never written a review before, but if I can save someone else 2 hours then I've done my good deed for the day.
This was directed by the same woman who directed In Love and Basketball...you can tell. It felt much more like a romance movie than a ""superhero"" movie.
Charlize did what she could, but her performance was formulaic. (I would attribute that more to the writers than her acting ability though...she really did do ok with what she was given)
It was Unnecessarily long.
It was terribly predictable, like Omg, Again, Have-they-run-out-of-ideas predictable.
The action scenes were ok at best, but by the time it really amped up I was over it.
Dialogue was cringeworthy at times, like at a lot of times. Most scenes felt more like a Saturday morning lifetime movie than an action film.
Honestly, if you fast forward through the film, you can understand the whole plot. You don't even need the sound.
And if the dialogue wasn't bad enough, the music was confusing. None of the songs in the movie matched anything. It was like they had an extra playlist laying around and just decided to use it because they ran out of time.

At one point they start an action scene and then cut to a conversation because if anything happens than the film would be good. The characters are flat especially the main villain.

972,bosleyjessie,Great Netflix action film!,8,12 July 2020,"I really loved this movie. The premise is cool, the cast is diverse & unique, and the action scenes are great.Really disappointing seeing all of the people leaving negative reviews because they think it's too ""woke"" - simply because it's a movie that introduces diversity. I was so happy to see a diverse cast, gay couple, etc.I only gave this an 8 because I wish it was set in the past (or just to have seen more historical scenes) and the soundtrack really wasn't good. It was like a Tokyo Drift soundtrack set to a cool, mythical action film. Really didn't fit the vibeOtherwise I loved it!",The Old Guard
973,brussetjulien,Good idea but it missed the mark,4,20 July 2020,"Interesting concept. Good acting. Good special effects. Unfortunately that is where the good stops. The plot is obvious, there is a slow middle and I found the moralistic claim to do good the protagonists promoted to be flawed logically: they speak against others committing evil for a greater good but spend half the movie killing people for some greater good they are unable to define.
As in many films today there is also a woke ideology that is rammed down our throats, but it does do it better than other productions such as 'Cursed'.
All of this made it very difficult for me to get attached to any characters and actually 'enter' the film. I always knew I was watching actors play in what looks like an expensive movie to make.",The Old Guard
974,mvincent-12339,What a pleasant surprise!,9,2 February 2021,"I was trawling Netflix looking for a movie to watch as I had seen all of the films that I wanted to see on Netflix (or so I thought). I started searching for films by my favourite actors/actresses and found this one.
I don't understand why there are so many haters of this film. I found the plot line, although simple, was enjoyable. I found the characters engaging. the action scenes were fine as well. I absolutely loved the music and am adding it to my listening 'musts', I certainly don't agree that it was the wrong music for the film Some of the special effects were very clever.
Some may say that I am easily pleased, but I watch a film to enjoy it, not to critique the whole cinematography (which by the way I thought was very good) or the deep underlying messages, (I don't care about those most of the time, and sometimes they spoil a movie). I rate a film on the basis of ""did I enjoy it?"" and ""would I watch it again?"", and the answer in both cases is ""hell yes!""",The Old Guard
975,mauid,"Good, not great!",7,17 July 2021,"I thought this movie was entertaining and had an original concept. The story line was simple, but fun. I thought the cast was believable and did a great job with what they were given. The fighting especially looked great!However, it could have been executed with more soul. A lot of the dialog was dumb, and the soundtrack was awful. Every song on there felt like a poor choice. Some scenes at the beginning and end had me scratching my head... For example, the empty then suddenly filled street in one scene.Overall I enjoyed it, and would recommend it. I think with some tweaks, esp with music and a more complex story the sequel could end up being great.",The Old Guard
976,JohnPapanikolaou,A mediocre action movie,7,19 October 2020,"The Old Guard is an action and fantasy movie of Netflix. What makes The Old Guard quite interesting movie is its script and the fantastic actor Charlize Theron who is always perfect in any role she plays. The movie is based on The Old Guard comic book series for those who are familiar with the comic series.I will not say that it is one of the best action movies we have seen, let's say that it is a mediocre action movie that would be a good choice to watch.My rating is 7,7",The Old Guard
977,hbrackley,Fun original action film.,8,11 July 2020,Hadn't seen reviews so went in blind and I really enjoyed it. A good date night movie.,The Old Guard
978,frgxcrzx,An action thriller with a strong underlying philosophy!,7,18 September 2021,"The Old Guard is a movie which has a strong underlying meaning that is almost similar. The movie delves into the subject of Immortality through a literal portrayal of lives of five immortals- the leader especially - an ancient woman, in fact, a mythical figure called Andromache The Scythian. Charlize Theron, aptly cast, with her phenomenal and dominating screen presence makes it look like an easy part as she effortlessly goes through with it. She has a decent support cast. But the most moving and inspiring moments transpire between Chiwetel Ejiofor and Kiki Layne in the last 30 minutes of the film and these moments save the movie from some really misplaced and awkward romantic confessions and emotional outbursts earlier in the movie. Kiki Layne delivers an unforgettable and capable performance - such as the scene in the elevator when she prepares for the battle ahead. The portrayal of Female Army troops in Afghanistan was thoughtful and very well executed by not making it too cliche-ridden. The movie has a good plot and an engaging screenplay. What is most extraordinary is the unique original background score and also the soundtrack. There is an effort to diversify the casting, which though seems deliberate can be excused for the larger point it tries to drive home. The ending of the movie is predictable but not poor.The major takeaway from the movie is the attempt made to show the misery that lies in immortality. As one lives longer and longer, the murky past and its unceasing memories lead to arousal of complicated questions that multiply progressively. That coupled with the loss of a sense of closure and satisfaction in any of the answers that one finds for those questions leaves them with ever increasing burden and unmitigating dissatisfaction. It makes me question- Is this what we are looking for so desperately? The movie shows it is for profits, accolades, each has their own motive, but the ultimate goal is to 'change the world' aka live longer.",The Old Guard
979,zhenekas,Its okish,6,13 July 2020,"Action is nice, the whole movie is ok, watchable, woke storyline but its fine, hollywood movies are going to be this way from now, so im not expecting much.

just goes to show how hard it is to make a good movie.half-way in and looking past the production quality, it's not bad. the story is very interesting but the camerawork in my humble opinion is shoddy. Due to the story one can have a good time regardless.I had it at 5 giving it 6. I just don't see this as a 7. Line delivery isn't the best and the wobbly, plastic sword wielded by Marwan Kenzari at the beginning when they stormed that underground bunker didn't help either.",The Old Guard
983,nathan-pitzer,Why are al lthe action shots weird looking,2,28 July 2020,Why is Charlize Theron making a weird doe in the headlights look every time the cam pans to her face? wide eyed goofy face.

Every scene was Cring and I had to drink alot to enjoy the dang thing something that has never happened in a Charlize Theron movie for me ever before.,The Old Guard
984,jenrave,Wonderful actors in a stenciled film,5,18 July 2020,"I am heartbroken and exhausted from films that play ""pandering to activists bingo"". The music is just whatever is currently popular with no regard to the mood of the film. The color scheme and shots feel like some default set. The villain is weak and flat. The tricksters are unconvincing in their changes of heart back and forth. The LGBTQ+ relationship just feels forced, and could've easily been very natural and convincing because again, the actors are wonderful, but the dialogues just didn't bring a sense of honesty or authenticity. At least the diversity didn't feel too much like tokenism, since the casting did its job very well and so did the actors.In summery - please stop playing bingo with the hot social topics of the day and write and direct better stories instead, where they will feel natural and earned.",The Old Guard
985,vauncey,Boring and cheap looking,5,12 July 2020,An intriguing concept that they don't do much with. Average action scenes but lots of blood. Feels like it could have done with another couple of drafts and some extra writers. Chief bad guy was overacting and a bit rubbish. My main fault was that it just looked cheap - more like a TV show than a big movie.,The Old Guard
986,Hinkson03003,The Community Score of 6.8 is Accurate,10,11 July 2020,"First thing's first, this is pure popcorn action, so it makes sense the community score is a 6.8 (as of right now). If you use the score as a gauge of whether to see a movie or not, you can have confidence in this one.I loved this so much is because of the subtle surprises. I haven't seen Charlize in many movies, but her fight sequences in this blew me away! She goes all in (one of the reasons I love Keanu in John Wick so much).On top of that, some of the questions asked (not explicitly) throughout the film like 'how would I act if I were immortal?' or 'what does it really mean to be immortal?' were icing on the cake. I love that these ideas weren't simply brought up once in order to check a box ... they play a big role in how the characters and story are written.",The Old Guard

Andy saves someone and 1 generation later daughter makes a medical discovery and now Andy is a great person. Like it was on purpose. She could ve saved Hitler's great great grandfather for all we know but that would ve been an accident of course. We're the good guys you re the bad(add needless cruelty there) and if you regret right after the fact you are good too.(Copley and Booker)This good-bad thing is like a child's idea of the world but then don't make the movie with gore and aim for you right audience.,The Old Guard

Aside from the emotional aspect, the brutality of having lived through numerous world struggles, and seeing your own family grow old and die is enough to fill anyone with an insatiable desire to end war, famine, oppression and disease. We all face the same fate eventually, so it's interesting to see a movie explore what we would do if we had more time to make a difference. I hope there is a sequel - we need to understand if there are others, and if humankind will continue to destroy the best of us and itself.",The Old Guard

That being said, I, personally loved the movie. The soundtrack was great, the action high-octane and the graphics were seamless (which for a movie based well outside the conform of reality is important so as not to take you out of the story - ie: when a person's intestines literally heal in front of your eyes).

However, there are far too many conveniences, which is the reason why the film is not as good as it could've been. The characters are able to find what they want or get where they want to get without any problems, because the writing is generic and lucks attention to details. A lot of questions have remained unanswered as well, which is a shame. Charlize Theron wasn't amazing but she did just fine. Overall not a bad film that deserves a watch one time only. It's PC as well, but it's not too bad tho.",The Old Guard

1010,j-hart123,Brilliant,10,10 July 2020,Fresh take on an action film! Netflix seems to produce some of the best new movies and series and this does not disappoint. You really connect with the characters and the actors are very talented. I could have easily watched a second movie straight after or at least another hour added to the film as I was mesmerised with the story line. There is so much potential from the characters pasts to how they became to be who they are now. I hope they make a sequel or even better a trilogy! 10/10,The Old Guard

Premise is great, it unfolds and gets deeper as the movie goes. No real character development other than Charlize, but there were some interesting choices and conflicts that legitimately kept me on my toes and continued to surprise/shock/stun me throughout. Fight choreography was pretty well done, and well executed by the cast, if not for those few ""oh I waited until you were done punching my buddy and then I fell into your chokehold.""

After listing my post. l looked at the other comments. There seemed to be a lot of hate about issues that weren't about the film. Giving it a lower rating then it deserves. Those same reviews seemed to take issue with things that didn't have to do with the film. Like a dislike for words like ""Woke"" and gave homophobic words of hate. Too similar in each post to be coincidence. Perhaps they used a different name on each review. Maybe they had their friends who think like them give the hate filled reviews.

Writing: 3/10
Choreography: 8/10
Music: 3/10The movie could have been a lot better than it was, which is too bad. The acting and fight choreography were the best parts. The directing was a bit better than adequate. The writing was ridiculous. The music seems to have been selected randomly from SoundCloud.The premise is basically identical to The Highlander. They dropped the accumulating-power trope and added some emo nihilism (that has an everythings-pickles-and-sunshine-now turn at the end). I don't think its a straight rip-off, I think its closer to fanfic. Unfortunately the writers seem to be something like late teens or twenty-somethings who think they're more mature than they really are. There's not a lot of consideration about real human suffering in the movie, though it does a lot of lip-service to it. The relationships are shallow and conspicuously agenda driven. If they had been more natural, it wouldn't have felt like teenagers trying to be edgy.It's not a waste of time-- because of the acting and choreography.

The soundtrack was terrible; and very often not fitting. The acting was ok.More importantly this full-length feature has the story of a new series pilot: this 2 hours movie answers one basic plot question, presents many new possibilities, introduces new characters, and throws a cliffhanger.

1041,yaclarkvasquez,Don't Read the Petty Reviews,8,13 July 2020,"From these reviews you would think this movie was a in your face woke fest... It's not. I think really it shows how many simpletons live in these reviews as nothing was force fed in this movie. After finding that it based off a comic series, I decided to read up on it. I'm going to go ahead and say there isn't much a difference from the comic than the movie in terms of characters story arc etc. In fact the author of the comic wrote the screenplay for the movie. I guess if you're a biggot with a small world view, this movie isn't for you. Everyone else should give it a watch, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",The Old Guard
1042,geeketteschat,A Breath Of Fresh Air Type of Action/ Comic Book Film,10,20 August 2020,"The old guard is a great action film directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood with great choreographed fight scenes showing the group of immortals fighting as a team especially the way Joe and Nicky fight as a duo. It asks very important questions about mortality and what living for so long will eventually do to your psyche. The characters have very interesting back stories. Andy is the leader who trying to find purpose in her very long life. Nile who is the audience stand in who is trying to understand what is happening to her and what her world would be like for now on. Joe and Nicky were the characters that I loved the most. Their back story can be its own film. Started as enemies and then eventually turn into lovers that is amazing. A queer couple in a comic book movie who are happy and in love secure in their relationship, Something The MCU, DC, and Star Wars would never do. The best thing I watched this summer.",The Old Guard
1043,ashy87,The movie lacks some tension for an action script but shows potential,7,14 July 2021,I found it enjoyable. The story had a very interesting premise and concept. The concept of immortality could've been explored in a deeper philosophical way (like the movie The Man from Earth) but then they reduced the movie to an action genre (not that there is anything wrong in that).I thought the casting choices were a little average (maybe that is something they could've improved upon). But maybe that's me being too harsh. Overall I enjoyed the movie and would love to see a sequel. It has potential if they could create more tension (which I felt was missing in this movie). Maybe if they could add the sort of tension that is created in the Jason Bourne action movies then I might give a higher rating than 7. But 7 is still a solid score.,The Old Guard

But with the glut of negative nancies, I've got to boost this. Is this movie perfect? No. The villain is cliche, the soundtrack was sometimes a little weird with the modern pop, and some of the situations were dramatic. But here's the thing-I judge a movie based on a few things.
1.) would I watch it again?
Heck yes.
2.) did I like the characters?
YES.
3.) was I ever bored?
Nope!!So here's the thing: this movie isn't perfect. But by god do I like it. Joe and Nicky's love made my heart melt, the loss of Quyhn made me gasp, Booker's betrayal made me MAD, and the revolution of Nile from not caring to saving them was great character development. The diversity was great, too-I love the seriousness with which joe and nicky's relationship is treated, and that the women we're allowed to be both strong and have flaws. Good characters all around.If you want an artsy, dark film that's aiming for oscars or some big point? This ain't it.

1068,shamekhjr,Potential John Wick Successor?,9,11 July 2020,"The Old Guard is also another movie that dropped on July 10th, and this time it's on Netflix, with the brand trying to push itself as a decent competitor in the action genre, with movies like 6 Underground, Extraction, and now The Old Guard.And I gotta say, Netflix is really getting the hang of it, I pretty much loved both 6 Underground and Extraction, and I'm liking this one a bit more.The Old Guard is based on the graphic comic book series from the same name and is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood and stars Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Matthias Shcoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Harry Melling. It takes place in modern times and tells the story of a group of immortals who've been fighting for good for centuries and didn't add anyone to their team until they learned that Nile Freeman (KiKi Layne's character) was also one of them.The story unfolds in pretty interesting ways but I'll let you discover that for yourself. Meanwhile, let's get to business. Since this is an action movie, the first question that comes to mind is well, how is the action? The action is great, the action sequences were very well choreographed and well filmed. I would also say they were inventive because it's not every day you see some old people fighting heavily armed and protected henchmen using swords and axes.As far as the plot goes, I was worried due to the genre's track record of pretty much messing up the story and loosing the essence of it, but it seems like this year is a little different (Bloodshot didn't ruin things for example). The Old Guard was well paced and managed to keep you interested throughout its entirety.The cinematography was pretty decent, nothing really to complain about. However, some of the people who read the source material pointed out that they would have wished if the movie inherited the source material's special art style instead of being shot like a regular action blockbuster.I would also like to add that I admired the film's choice of songs. They add a nice flavour to the movie while simultaneously being connected to the film's overall theme. I'm saying this because as I pointed out in my review of Greyhound (2020), the last thing i saw before this, the music/score was one of the film's weaknesses.With all that good stuff now out of way, to truly evaluate this movie, we need to compare it to the current gold standard of action, which is the one and only, John Wick. So, how do they compare? Well, The Old Guard has the better premise, but John Wick did a better job with the world building. Both films feature quality cinematography, but of course, John Wick is, was and will always be the superior in terms of action. However, I will dare say The Old Guard came pretry close.The search for the 2020 MOTY is still continuing, but 2020 is shaping up to be a good year despite the pandemic, keeping in mind there's still Nolan's Tenet, Wes Anderson's The French Dispatch, Matthew Vaughn's The King's Man and 007's No Time to Die to still look out for.",The Old Guard

Actually I knew the movie will not be good when I saw the baclava bet scene. Scenes like that, with no point and actual meaning to the plot, are main characteristics of so-so movies. Real sad part is Charlize Theron looks in this movie like she would prefere to do enything else, like wash your dishes, her acting lacks fire and is limited to punches and longing, sad gazes, nothing else.

1087,contatothiagodiassantos,Film carries proof that adaptation is not synonymous with quality.,4,26 July 2020,"The Old Guard carries proof that adaptation is not synonymous with quality. The infamous comic book writer Greg Rucka, already famous for his facets in DC, assumed for the first time the responsibility of writing the script for a film adaptation, in the case of the miniseries he created at Image Comics with Argentine artist Leandro Fernandez. Having modifications with respect to Netflix, we accompany a group of warriors that do not die, and that it was after age they watched the wars of men until arriving these days, when they act as a squad of special operations trying to do good in the world . Charlize Theron leads the internationalized cast, whose ethnicities and origins correspond to their characters in the miniseries, from rival knights to the Crusades to the survivor of the Napoleonic wars. In the centralism of Old Guard there is disillusionment with the viewer, coming in the cold behavior of the characters and in the shootings of Tarantino. The quality of the structure is not able to give a voice to HQ that does not come immediately. This is the work of an epic distinction that different media do not have the same simulated content as other militarized scenes. It is a great orgasm of violated trivialization. Part of the responsibility is, of course, with Greg Rucka, whose script combines Highlander with Sense8 but lacks the charm of the former or the globalizing wit of the latter. As a construction of a historical and geopolitical universe, his text is satisfied with clichés of the American imagination (the maximum of exoticism in the world is always to return to the mud houses of Afghanistan) and with jokes of namedroping (it is very symptomatic that there is grace with the fact that Andy had sex with Auguste Rodin but there is no mention of the current affairs, which would humanize the character as in the HQ, however empty). These moments are supposed to take the viewer on a journey through history and its famous famous figures, but in reality they are a pedantic list of references that only evidence the laziness of the script in seeking any specificity. What is left is the result of a look at violence and speeches over paranoia trying to be an adaptation, taking refuge in the violent action accumulated in non-adaptation but in strangeness.",The Old Guard

1091,emoboyz-92605,WARRIORS THAT LIFE MUST SURVIVE,8,7 September 2020,"Since Mad Max: Fury Road was released in 2015, I became one of the viewers who really believed that Charlize Theron was a really promising action star. His drama or comedy films are good, but every action film he stars in always manages to entertain. Just look at Atomic Blonde, where he turns into someone as deadly as John Wick.Now Charlize Theron is the main star in The Old Guard, Netflix's newest film directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Beyond the Lights). He plays Andromache the Scythia, or as Andy is usually called. Here, he leads a secret squad of four where all the members are immortal, which means immortal. They have lived for over hundreds of years, with Andy being the oldest of the four.The four of them do have unique traits and pasts, so that they are able to keep this team interesting to continue to be followed. Besides Andy, there is Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) who has lost someone he loved in his life. Likewise with Andy, so that the two of them, despite continuing to utilize their strengths, always find it difficult to fight the feelings of grief that always enveloped them.Then there are Nicky (Luca Marinelli) and Joe (Marwan Kenzari) who have lived from the time of the Crusades, where they had previously killed each other constantly because they were in different camps, but interestingly, they have now become inseparable lovers. Indeed, there are many action films that use the concept of a group like this, but The Old Guard managed to make the team interesting and different from other films with a similar concept.While on a mission for Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), former CIA, Andy and his team apparently entered a trap that Copley had planned to prove that this team was a group of people who lived eternally. Copley also plans to catch the four of them and hand them over to Merrick (Harry Melling), the head of Merrick Pharmaceutical who aims to research the four in order to get a cure for all kinds of diseases.Once upon a time Andy and his team had a dream simultaneously, when in Afghanistan there was a marine who had just risen from the dead, a young woman named Nile Freeman (KiKi Layne). Andy, with alacrity, immediately came and fetched him to join the fun team. Eternal life is fun, right?With his short black hair, nimble and deadly movements and a really cool ax, Andy does look like a perfect action character. Not only that, his past also adds to the aura of mystery in the film and again makes me think, how long have Andy and his friends lived?There is a conversation between Andy and Nile that perfectly creates a mysterious aura about Andy's life. As Nile prayed, Andy asked, ""You prayed? God doesn't exist. "" ""My God exists,"" replied Nile. Andy then continued to reply ""You know, there was a time when I was worshiped as a god.""From the characters alone, I was curious about how this film would go. But, wouldn't it mean that if the characters couldn't die, all the action in the film would be wasted because we knew they couldn't die? This is where this film feels smart because it still tries to provide an explanation of something that has the potential to make the film feel odd.Andy explained that even if the wounds he and his friend received can heal instantly, there will be times when the wounds won't close by themselves and they can die like ordinary people. Maybe today the wounds received could be healed, but tomorrow the eternal life they had could be lost and they could just die.That way I can still feel, even though they have a very big advantage, the feeling of danger that always looms over them every time they encounter an enemy. Every time I get shot or stabbed by a sharp object, I immediately think, ""Is it the time when they are no longer immortal? Is it the time for them to die, after living so long? ""The fighting part of this film is really exciting, it doesn't need to be argued anymore. Especially when it comes to close combat, like when Andy fought a group of people wearing vests complete with weapons. With a sword in the right hand, and a gun in the left, the scene again shows how talented Charlize Theron is in killing people with a fairly complex choreography.However, what I might regret about this film is the use of the music. Wait a minute, the music in this film is really fun, I agree with that. But imagine if the music in this film, instead of using electropop music from various musicians, uses epic music that shakes the adrenaline like music from a composer who really knows how to evoke a scene with music, like Hans Zimmer's music.Adapted from the comic of the same name, The Old Guard is indeed a very interesting comic film because it is not only an exciting action film with a unique story, but also prepares to become a film that will have a sequel because it still has a story that can be continued and become something. that is bigger than this film. And if the first film is this good, then the sequel idea looks both tantalizing and promising.Not only does this film have the potential to start a new franchise, but The Old Guard has also succeeded in making a concept that may be used by other films (especially superhero films) feel very fresh. Especially with a story that manages to make the concept look different and the characters are very exciting to follow, making this an action film suitable to accompany summer at home.",The Old Guard

Especially when it came to the exposition related to a ""lost"" member of their groupVillain was almost hilariously two dimensionalOverall it's a fun romp for a Friday night, but nothing about it really makes it shine amidst the dozens of other great action flicks that have been released over the last 5 years. Certainly it doesn't deserve the 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s some reviewers have been giving it.",The Old Guard
1097,kandelai,Ready for more,8,12 July 2020,"The movie is basically setting up the lore and throwing us head first into it. I didn't read the comic books, so based on movie script alone. A wild ride, tough female lead with good supporting cast and even a twist. I am ready for more.",The Old Guard
1098,apm_bay,"What is nuance, where is Furiosa, and what is that goddamn soundtrack supposed to be?",3,13 July 2020,"The concept is an intriguing one: A group of immortal guns-for-hire finds itself in the crosshairs of a pharmaceutical company trying to harvest the secret of their longevity.But the powers that be manage to waste the concept. The only good thing about this movie is its cast, but that's about it.The cast sans Theron, by the way.I cannot even begin to comprehend how the same actress who gifted us with the most convincing and memorable female bad-ass since Ellen Ripley (i.e. Furiosa in ""Mad Max"") was even physically able of turning in such a plank-of-wood performance.The plot is more holes than substance. The dialogues are bland and though they pretend to be deep they fail to truly explore the burden of immortality, the weight of the expectations a person with godlike powers surely would feel.The setpieces are okay-ish. The action scenes are competently done, though not mind-blowing. The pretentious soundtrack, however, is just awful and an outstandingly bad idea.Unfortunately... at the end of the day... this flick is just dull. The director has no sense for pacing at all.And then there's the social messaging. My goodness. It's about as subtle as a conrete pillar hit at a hundred miles an hour.There's a scene where one of the gay protagonists when mockingly asked: ""Is he your boyfriend?"" literally delivers a monologue chiding the baddie for not understanding the essence of true love.It's as though contemporary filmmakers do not know the meaning of the word 'nuance' anymore.Even worse, they could've just organically included the gay couple by contenting themselves with an earlier scene where all our heroes lie scattered about a train car sleeping, and the two dudes are nestled against each other. Like, no big deal - because it isn't.Instead, they have to waste your time by making it a big deal. And treat you to a scene which some dork writing fanfiction on the internet could've had handled more skilfully.'The Old Guard' also has a segment showing a female engagement team in Afghanistan gathering intelligence from the local population. My first thought was: Cool, that's never been done before! And then the whole thing goes to hell thanks to the most stereotypical casting imaginable. Hoorah!Jesus... I wasn't even able to watch this thing to the end in one sitting. It has its moments, but they're few and far between.",The Old Guard

I knew nothing about. It was only after watching that I discovered it's actually an adaptation. But let me tell you, forget about anything before watching this movie. Watch for what it is and what you feel, hear and see. This movie deserves 10 stars. All the characters had development. The plot was concise and executed brilliantly. No without flaws, because there isn't a perfect movie for everyone. But you can't be down voting just because it's an adaptation with gender swaps.

How did 2 'lovers' hook up during the crusades. Wouldn't they have been persecuted? Couldn't that part of history be shown. Charlize and Q's relationship wasn't exactly 'outed' but wish they fleshed out that story, How Andy found out she was immortal. Booker's family history could have been shown too. Why do they get premonitions? They just say they can't be killed and we are supposed to believe them, that they saved hundreds of lives . The villains Merrick nerdy and young moneymonger motive and characters were pathetic and poor. Chiwetel's 'evil' motive was poorly under used and would have made a more compelling villain. Action became a bit repetitive and unnecessarily violent- we get it! They are immortal but why? Music was at times annoyingly inserted at the wrong places . Not Good direction.",The Old Guard

1132,tastytomatoes,Bogged down by the screenplay like a metal case on the seabed.,6,12 July 2020,"Charlize Theron kicks ass in a role where she wields a centuries-old axe and displays the weight of weariness.DIRECTION:The direction is fine; but the sudden use of pop songs within scenes are completely out of place and distracting. The action scenes are sparse given how it tries to be an action drama. The actions themselves are nothing remarkable, offering little intensity like the Bourne movies or enjoyability like the John Wick, MI: Fallout and Atomic Blonde movies.SCREENPLAY:The storyline is predictable with no nuances. It explores the idea of life and death at the surface level. The dialogue is mostly in-your-face and unnatural, so are the character motivations. Chiwetel's character is poorly written. Harry Melling's character and performance is a complete caricature and poor excuse of a villain. The scene where Charlize Theron's character interacts with a pharmacy cashier is unnecessarily forced.ACTING:Charlize Theron is the highlight for sure and I wish they focused more on her character. Chiwetel Ejiofor is under-utilised. Kiki Layne is fine. Not a fan of Matthias Schoenaerts' acting at all.MY VERDICT: A couple of cool moments. Watch The Old Guard if the premise intrigues you. If you are a fan of Charlize Theron. If you don't mind a movie with action scenes stitched together by bland dialogue (apart from one love monologue scene).",The Old Guard

However, the action is great, Charlize nailed her role and fighting sequences, some minor twists kept me interested and all in all good acting and directing and somewhat interesting plot with some plot holes of course as in most movies.

1159,ericd-75172,"One Great Actress, and One Tantalizing Cliff Hanger",2,23 August 2020,"The best part of the movie is Nile, KiKi Layne's character, who is the only actor/actress who cared enough about her job to take a firearms course in order to deliver a convincing performance as a bad-ass marine turned immortal.
The only other redeeming factor of this movie is the end scene teaser setting up a future story that ties into an earlier plot point.
The rest of the movie is probably the most cringe thing I have ever seen. I know Netflix has access to good action/fighting/firearms instructors, and why they didn't use them is beyond me.
For example, in one of the opening scenes that sets up the main plot involving bad-guys who are para-military/mercenaries is so unbelievable, and had such little thought put into how even a normal person would act let alone trained killers, that it immediately ruins any possible immersion into the film and it's world.
Had they at least made the first act of the movie believable it probablt could've gotten a solid 5 out of 10, instead of the 2 for being such a cringe fest (again except for KiKi Layne, who was the only one who's effort and hard work was visible)",The Old Guard

I've loved Theron for a long time, but honestly I think she was probably the weakest actor/actress in the film. Her cliché movie moments and lack of personality at the beginning of the film can be justified through her character arch and the character's history, so it doesn't bother me much. Especially because the character improves throughout the film. It takes away a little bit at the beginning, but absolutely does not make or break the movie.The attention to detail was fantastic. Blood, fingerprints, weaponry, photographs, and all of that were put in in a way that felt natural and real in ways I haven't seen in recent movies. The choreography was amazing, and so unique because of the range of weaponry included. The fluidity of the fight scenes and the way the characters work together is beautiful. The depth and complexity of many of the characters is much better than anything I've seen in a while. And the tactful feminism presented with powerful, smart female characters while also having amazing, strong male characters as well instead of one or the other? So good. The relationships, romantic, platonic, or otherwise are so well done. Beautiful.I don't understand why this movie doesn't have better reviews, but I'm leaving one because I want a sequel real bad lol. I know you're just sitting there binge watching tv shows anyway, might as well give this movie a shot since you have nothing to lose hahaha.",The Old Guard

Apart from Charlize and one or 2 actors the acting is so bad, boring and utterly not convincing.
Kiki Layne does not deliver her role whatsoever and I'm convinced she just got the role for ""diversity purposes"". I'm all for diversity but please cast people with talent.

Not every movie has to have an ingenious plot and revolutionary action sequences.

And for some reasons or others, there are numerous bad comments about it like:"" The soundtrack is quite off-track, mediocre, etc and etc."". Thus, being honest, I did not expect much from this movie. However, I was wrong since this movie is just so good. It touches a lot of global issues, mostly religious fanaticism, bigotry, war and conflict, that we, as an audience does not even recognize or admit it. Honestly, these topics are quite sensitive as well so maybe it's the reason for bad score, I dunno *Gallic shrug*. Moreover, the sound track is not offtrack at all (but it's not exceptionally good like Sense8 though...). Since I am not a movie professional critic, I will not debate about the script. But there are a lot of cute moment between the couple in this movie that's quite a reason for me to watch it twice as they just too cute!!!But anyway, it's a good movie, not exceptionally good, but it worth the try, since it offer you almost everything you need, from thrill action to romance and realistic (to reinforce my idea, I would point out that the old guard is the symbol that represent for those who silently try to save the earth, not too much, just right).

I mean how is this possible with all the intel they have on the old guards. Another bizarre twist is the behavior pattern of Nile. one minute she is like 'i don't want to kill anyone'. 10 minutes later, she overcomes all that fear and kill a bunch of people!

Doesn't know how to act at all.It feels like they asked a 16 year old to pick the music for the soundtrack.

This was a bombass of a movieeeee. I liked the plot a lot, they explained the story well enough to make it all easy to understand but not too much in detail so that it becomes boring. Their are action sequences scattered throughout the movie so it keeps us hooked to the screen. The amalgamation of old school filmography and latest military style fighting techniques is just a treat for the eyes. Charlize Theron has completely nailed it, I mean just swept me off the feet with that performance. Being a centuries old hardened warrior girl with centuries of learned fighting techniques I couldn't imagine anyone else doing it better. In female protagonist movies that depict the woman as a ninja only few have been able to pull it off like Milla Jovovich(Alice in resident evil), Scarlett Johnson(Avengers) and Angelina Jolie(Lara croft) but trust me on this Charlize Theron has done complete justice to the role. You won't believe but I saw the trailer on snapchat, then went to netflix and started watching without even knowing what year this has been made and I thought its an old movie at the back of my mind. The graphics were quite decent, the getting shot in the head and healing looked really natural which made me wonder wait this looks too natural such graphics were not available a few years back and bam!

I rarely watch movies from start to finish without getting bored and reading a book whilst semi watching the film as well, unless I'm forced to at the cinema of course, however with this movie I was hooked from the start and couldn't believe 2hrs had passed already.

1234,chetanpr2003,You know what you are getting into.,8,18 July 2020,"Let me be outright in saying that this is no Nolan or Guy Richie film.So, one look at the trailer you realize that this is meant to be a Netflix film and they are not shy about it.The characters and story line for most part is well etched out and leaves you wanting for more history. Maybe this will come as future parts.This is a worthy film in comparison to Extraction and every other recent attempt in creating the small screen pot boiler.Not the usual template but has some references.Please doing expect John Wick level action but yeah the action set pieces is quite decent.I am rating it for its merit and being conscious about why this exists rather than comparing it to the bigger budget blockbusters.",The Old Guard
1235,joe-2303,"Boring, trite, blatantly superfluous song placements.",1,11 July 2020,"I had this on in the background while doing work and almost stopped it even as something to watch distractedly. What a waste of talent and potential for a good film. I found it utterly predictable, boring and with non-engaging characters. I wouldn't even watch this on a plane.",The Old Guard
1236,Crom86,"Time to step up your game, Netflix!",4,18 July 2020,"Where to start with this one.. I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to warn others after viewing this one.After watching Extraction, another Netflix action film of the same style (mercenaries, lots of gunplay, fight scenes etc.), I was hoping this film would keep up the pace. Extraction was actually quite enjoyable and had superb action so I was expecting something on par.Alas, this one is actually a downgrade in all aspects. To play the devil's advocate, I will say that even those movies produced by Netflix, you know the kind- those that have this straight-to-video vibe, are infitely better to what we actually used to get by straight-to-video movies back in the Video Club days. So straight away, this is a plus for Netflix overall, as most movies they put out are, at least, watchable.Now to the movie itself. Without spoiling it, I will just say that the main premise of the film, the basis onto which the story is supposed to be carried on, is contradicted within a few minutes into it! I've never seen a film that cancels itself out so radically. I am wondering if the people who wrote the script bothered to read it a second time because there is a giant plot hole right there.Moreover, there is little to no character development and even, then, they somehow manage to fail. The main villain is cartoony and your typical ""bad guy"" but if you analyze his motivations he is actually the hero of the movie! Again, trying not to spoil it but from a real life perspective, he actually sounds very reasonable and his intentions are far from evil.In regards to the quality of the film, you kinda know what to expect. OK direction, OK action sequences, OK acting, OK photography... Pretty much a ""OK"" vibe, like most Netflix movies. The one thing that is absolutely atrocious was the soundtrack. The choices they made are completely terrible, mismatching the vibe of what is happening on screen. I am all for contemporary music and not orchestral (cheaper as well) but it's like they comissioned 20 songs without knowing what film they were shooting.All in all, I am expecting Netflix to step up their game. They've shown they can produce some interesting and relatively good quality films (Annihilation, Extraction to name a couple) so it's not like they cannot do it. It just seems like they are content churning out indifferent films of average quality, instead of focusing on making something decent. To put it simply, they favor quantity over quality. It makes sense, with almost 200 million subs you cannot please everyone but Netflix if keen on producing golden mediocrity, hoping to satisfy the lowest common denominator.",The Old Guard

1257,hazeztmd2003,Back story needs a little more thinking through,9,18 July 2020,"Action is superb and believable but you would think a group of immortals will amass a decent amount of wealth over the millennia to finance their altruistic endeavors and not just rely on their immortal bodies to do the heavy lifting while keeping their identities a secret. That the group with their kick ass leader will be influential enough not to depend on other individuals/organizations to give them assignments or jobs, that they too should've built their own organization picking the cases worth their time with hired muscles to do most of the rescuing... I'm just saying they should be living in castles and influencing high tech operations that will put their skill set to use at the bare minimum. I mean even if you're invincible why not wear a bullet proof vest so as not to shout out loud hey I don't die! That would have been more plausible since apart from being able to return from the dead they are not immune to capture and torture. Be that as it may. The old guard shows Ms. Theron at her action best. She was so convincing I would've wanted to see her paired with John Wick instead of Ms. Berry as a comrade and not a villain. As effective as she is as a villain I prefer her in the lead like old guard. Acting wise Ms. Theron nailed it with the right touch of weariness, strength and vulnerability. Mr. Marinelli and Mr. Kenzari was awesome to watch as well I like how they resisted each other a Saracen and a Christian fighting each other to the death only to fall madly for each other, how awesome is that to be able to spend immortality together. I just wish if a sequel is in the works the story line will be better all I ask is to make it believable not something I have to swallow just because. The actors and the story concept of immortals deserve better. Other than my gripe with the writer it is an awesome watch.",The Old Guard

I love the action scenes, better than what I could imagine. The couple is amazing, as was in the comics - but as anything people can label as ""woke"", sadly a lot of people immediately dislike it.One thing it lacks is more flashbacks, more trips to the past. I feel like this movie could have been an hour longer, with that full hour being spent in the Crusades, Napoleon's War, all of them finding each other, finding they're immortal, etc. That could be hard budget wise, of course.Sadly a movie is not enough to tell that big of a story and a TV series would be PERFECT to tell it in the detail it deserves.",The Old Guard

Some of the dialogue was a bit clunky, but I'm still glad this movie exists and did fairly well. Because this means more of these types of movies can be made. No, I don't mean another generic action movie (and I still love those movies). I mean sci-fi/supernatural ones that have great premise, and characters worth rooting for.The action was fun.

One glaring one, unless I missed something. I thought Andy was going to die. But the movie left us with the idea that the gang, including Andy, will live on to fight evil in the future. Her survival was never explained in the script. I had to go back and watch the end again to see if I missed something. Doesn't seem I did. But who knows.
They had all the elements for a 2020 movie (but fell short with the script.) They had their token gay relationship and token minority characters so they won't get cancelled by the mob. Wait, they didn't have an Hispanic! Oh no! Looks like we will have to cancel them for that.They are obviously hoping this will become a franchise the way they set it up and left it.

1301,wolfy994,"Decent premise, lackluster delivery.",7,13 July 2020,"I'm giving it a rating of 7 as it's pretty watchable and doesn't hurt to see.However, it tries to be philosophical at times talking about how they did all this good by saving some lives while at the same time showing them killing countless goons whom we're just supposed to assume are ""the bad guys"".The antagonist in this movie is laughable: The guy helping them kind of has a ""save the world"" motivation, but they couldn't do the antagonist the same courtesy. The bad guy is just a money hungry capitalist. Even the bad capitalist deserves some justification in a movie that tries to (although briefly) paint the good guys as only good depending on the century as one of the characters said.There was room to play with moral relativity and deontology here, but it's skipped and skimmed with some lackluster conclusions.Still pretty watchable if you ignore the things it tries to do and just focus on relaxing and popcorn.",The Old Guard

Makes them seem like losers.",The Old Guard
1303,ptbarnett,Storyline Eviscerated by Soundtrack,5,12 July 2020,"The Old Guard is another well done comic book script with tons of potential. Although the film is a bit formulary, the unrealized potential comes in the form of the soundtrack, which destroys any hope for an emotional experience.Many nostalgic, middle-aged men have adored Charlize Theron since her first appearance with Dior. Still quite attractive, she delivered a wonderful tough-girl role as the matriarchal leader of a small group of immortal mercenaries. Using expert martial arts skills and enough weapons to overflow an armory, the team attempts to resist efforts to imprison them as test subjects in a laboratory. Harry Melling turned in a noteworthy performance as Merrick, the psychotic, fortune-and-power-hungry C.E.O. of a big pharmaceutical company. Eventually double-crossed, the team is delivered to him, who has plans for them as lab rats.Along the way, the immortal soldiers engage in several gratuitous, testosterone-boosting fight scenes, finally succumb, then are freed in a hailstorm of bullets, broken bones, and bedlam. After each of these, the film delivers a solid kick to the groin and causes one to wither by way of its soundtrack, which is near-absolute crap.There are some original charts which are standard scene filling, but the majority of songs in the film were recorded with a Mr. Microphone, a Fisher-Price radio, and Autotune to disguise the amateur, untrained voice. Mostly ballads, their incredibly poor musical value unequivocally destroys those elevated emotion scenes that they follow.There are 27 people listed in the ""Music Department"" category., but the soundtrack is not listed and these folks are probably responsible for the theme music. Nonetheless, there is one responsible person who programmed the open mic night karaoke songs, and that person is either a novice, tone deaf, or a relative of the ""artists"".Autotune should have been a passing fad. If one's voice Is underdeveloped, take voice lessons. Having a synth pad and a microphone at home does not make one a recording artist. The unfortunate contradiction Is that people got paid for crap. The self-taught home studio method of production is en vogue today, but to attach that kind of work to any film guarantees that the film will die young and never become iconic or watched in 10 years for the sake of nostalgia.Watch the film, but turn on the subtitles and keep a finger on the mute button.",The Old Guard
1304,abbazabby,"Not perfect, but still an entertaining watch",10,11 July 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not perfect, but it's a fantastic movie. It's an action-drama, and both elements are executed well. I was invested in the characters, each are well developed and fleshed out. I was invested in the story. Both characters of Andy and Nile lead perfectly. The relationship between Joe and Nicky was raw. Booker and Andy's pain show how immortality can be a curse. The action scenes were choreographed fantastic (definitely lots of gore), the cinematography was breath taking, and the story itself was well written, well directed, and well done. I am glad they had Rucka write the screenplay. Prince-Blythewood did an excellent job for her first action film.
The only things keeping this from a 10/10 was that the music felt a bit out of place, and the enemy did not feel as intimidating against immortal warriors. The last half felt a bit predictable, yet the end had enough of a jaw dropping moment to surprise me. Some dialogue felt a bit forced. These are minor things compared to the scale of the story, the action scenes, and the drama scenes that fleshed out the characters.
I really appreciated the representation and diversity in this film. Along with that, there was no sexualization of our female leads, and for me, that is very important. Truly refreshing to see female leads like this. The character development throughout was on point, and the overall message was one of still seeing the good in humanity.
It was gritty, raw, violent, authentic, and a great film. I am really hoping for more.
All in all, an enjoyable and entertaining watch. Not perfect, but still great. Planning on rewatching this very soon.",The Old Guard

1307,sioncamara,Good movie not quite an action movie thought.,8,19 October 2020,"After reading a review on rotten tomatoes that stated the movie had great character development and got at raw human emotion I was intrigued. I think this film may be getting more negative reviews than it deserves, not because it's a bad movie, because it not marketed well. After watching the trailer online I thought this would be an action movie. If I watched this movie expecting an action movie I would probably be disappointed, but I watched it expecting an emotional movie that created deep character development. Watching the movie expected this made it quite an enjoyable film. If those are the kids of films you'll likely enjoy this movie. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it does give a unique insight on what it would be like to be immortal from an emotion perspective.",The Old Guard

But the movie was still a good movie to watch. I loved that the predominant romance of the movie was between two men. Some will have a problem with that and they are free to watch any of the Steven Seagal, Liam Neeson, Bruce Willis action movies already on the market. This is a movie that features diversity and doesn't shy away from showcasing the world as being more than one country or one race. The movie was big on female empowerment, but it happened without bashing men. I think people should give this movie a chance, but it's definitely a 15-17 year old and up movie because of the violence and amount of blood.",The Old Guard
1309,leeahruta,I loved it!,8,18 July 2020,I agree that the music has been off putting and it didn't fit the overall atmosphere but I really enjoyed how the characters were written. How it broke certain traditional and repeated sets of rules of Hollywood writing (like killing off the gay characters or having a black person be included in the story just got the sake of addressing racism). I love how it was written by a black woman too! No hypersexualization of women! This movie shows true representation. Sure there were some plot holes and at times it felt too slow and too dragged or too cliche. But it's just so refreshing to see such a good team working together so well. There's no male ego being hurt from being led by a woman. She's not bossing them around either. There genuine family love between the team. And Nile! Such a badass character who isn't seen as the black sidekick thrown into the mix to appease the black community. She is just as important! The story could have been better overall but the writing of the characters and the badassery of the stunt coordinators has been great! I really really want a sequel!,The Old Guard

Also, some other things really bugged me. When we first meet Nile, she is a Marine on a man hunt. This gave me a whaaaaat? moment. Since when is a female Marine, in charge of other females allowed to be on their own in the Middle East? Then she removes her cover (helmet) in an unsafe area. Then on top of that, when she shoots the bomber they were looking for, she rushes to render first-aid. She does clear the enemy rifle but does not check his hands or for any other weapons.

1327,smcateer-78684,A Diamond in the Rough,9,12 July 2020,"I don't write reviews here often, but I knew had to when I saw the scores this movie got. This movie is not a 10, but it isn't a 1, 5, or a 7 either. Not even close.Pros:
For starters, the action in this film is fast paced, brutal, and honestly a spectacle to watch. Think a team of immortal John Wicks. The way the camera whips around the scene provides a kinetic energy to the fights, while abstaining from any annoying shaky cam that blurs the cool stuff.Our team of heroes are each extremely enjoyable, charismatic, and well acted. Andy, Booker, Joe, Nicky, and Nile each have considerable depth and personality that makes each distinct enough for me to remember their names hours after watching the film.The premise of this film is well executed. I understand that this is a point of contention for some folks that didn't love this film, so I'll discuss what I enjoyed. This film asks questions big and small about the intricacies of immortality. How do those that have watched civilizations rise and fall feel about the state of the world? Do they ever get lonely as everyone around them inevitably dies? Where can you find some good baklava? Every way that the film grapples with its subject material is fascinating, and I'm itching to learn more.Cons:-While our heroes are all loveable and well fleshed out, our villain doesn't get the same treatment. Ultimately, he feels a bit toothless and immature when compared to the rest of the cast. His motivations are understandable, but his persona could have used some work. Perhaps they were going for an angle that suggested that there is no one villain? Overall, human nature (throughout time) and losing hope prove to be the greatest obstacles of all.Conclusion:
When seeing this film, it is important to manage expectations. Do not go in expecting a tour de force or Oscar worthy directing. Do not go in expecting to be brought to tears or shocked by any huge twists. If you need those things from a film, you will be disappointed. You are also a prude. Lighten up! This is a popcorn film first and foremost! It doesn't need to be oscar bait, and it isn't trying to be. For what it is, I couldn't have asked for a better time. Enjoy the action, charismatic cast, and fascinating concept. Not every action, or comic book movie is handled with as much love or care as this. I hope we get more.Give it a shot, and I hope you enjoy it! I know I did.",The Old Guard

It seems clear to me that the reviews of this film should be grouped according to the reviewers preferences so that the reader of the reviews would be able to pick the guidance most relevant for the reader.
In this case, if you as a parent are looking for a great film to watch with your young kids then this movie is close to perfection. But, if you are watching the movie with your intellectual friends hoping the movie to become the source of philosophical discussions then you will be disappointed.

So many silent brooding stretches should have been used instead to flesh out the characters. We were never told enough about them to care very much at all.

You have on one hand Mad Max: Furry Road, one of the best action films ever. On the other you have Atomic Blonde, a well acted film that is lacking in every other department.The best thing I can say about this film is the acting, everyone is great here. Charlize Theron does a fantastic job in this film but it's not only her who's great here. Kiki Layne does a superb job as a nieve young immortal. I also taught Matthias Schoenaenaerts have a really nice suttle performance in the film.The action scenes were for the most part well filmed, with Prince-Bythewood showing a lot of nice wide takes. Best of all every charecter had a unique fighting style, for example Charlize Theron's character fight verry stern and you accually get the feeling that she is experienced and she's been at this for awhile.I also could get behind Harry Melling's motivation. His motivation is that he thinks their blood could heal millions of people while still being able to keep them alive.My biggest complaint is that it feels like fifteen minutes could have been cut of this film at the start. We get setup about the immortals, before Kiki Layne runs into them, and It comes across as repetitive because we learn this information again.Also the Pacing tanks in the middle of the second act right after an action scene in a church occers.Finally I taught the music didn't work here. I don't think it's awful music, I think it's the use of it in the action scenes. It takes all the suspence out of the action sequences.Overall I thought The Old Guard was an average action movie with good performances. I would personally say you're not missing out on much!",The Old Guard

1345,dexcallumthetinkerer,The Old Guard: an action thriller that is well worth the watch.,8,19 July 2020,"Charlize Theron flexes her action chops in this well made action flick as Four ancient warriors must battle to save this secret identity form money hungry and manipulative corporations while mentoring a new fighter who has inherited the same resurrection powers as them. In doing all of this, The Old Guard mixes classic action film bang bang with intimate coming of age tropes and does them well.All five main characters are Acted superbly, and one can easily imagine that all four of the older characters have been alive for hundreds, even thousands of years. The film follows The Old Guard as they juggle keeping this identities as age old eternals secret from the world while mentoring a young marine who was just bestowed the same questionable blessing as them.If you are a connoisseur of action films with high stakes tension and adult themes, then The Old Guard is for you. I am a film student, and I found that while this film does not break much new ground, it's clever plot and intelligent screenwriting dodged many of the pitfalls and Deus Ex Machina traps that so many modern action films fall into these days. The Old Guard had clear acts, well defined character arcs and motivations, and each action that the characters took had a believeable and understandable goal behind it.Another aspect of The Old Guard was the films approach to LGBTQ+ thmes and allyship. Yep, if you are a homophobe, probably steer away from this film, as you might get triggered. Two of the Old Guard, Nicky and Joe are in a same sex relationship, and while the film doesnt shove it in the viewer's face, they don't shy away from the fact that the two are lovers, and as someone who is on the rainbow flag, I Found their heartwarming relationship to be a lovely example of LGBTQ+ allyship done very right.While there were one or two slight plot holes, they could all be explained after some thought, and didn't mar my enjoyment of the film in any way, unlike many contemporary films I have watched.Overall, I had a good time while watching The Old Guard, and as a lover of action films and film itself, I can enthusiastically reccommend it as well worth your watch.",The Old Guard

I read quite a few reviews and it feels like most of them hate the fact the movie has a diverse cast?! Like what? Why is that something to hate? It's like they are deliberately trying to find faults because the movie has a female lead and POC characters in strong roles. One user was ranting about wokeness because the villian in the movie was big pharma? Lol.
It has a great storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
The characters are well written and interesting. It is one of the best movies I've watched this year. And honestly, I've watched a lot of bad movies. I would 100% recommend the movie to someone who loves good cinema. Decide for yourself and don't bother reading the reviews.",The Old Guard
1357,larissa-60249,Wow so bad ...,3,12 July 2020,"I stopped halfway through this movie to create and IMDB account just to say how disappointing this movie is. I've never dislike a Charlize movie... and for some reason she took it, but man it was pathetic. Let's start a modest list, shall we?1. The soundtrack was juvenile, did a shuffle-dancing teeny bopper chose this music? Threw the tone off.2. The writing was so flat, pretty sure the writer doesn't know how to write dialog, make people sound like people, and not make things cheesy, ""kid""3. It's so socially woke and sensitive, that there's little genuine tension.4. The movie feels like it was written for 14-year olds.5. Harry Potter's Dudley Dursley is the bad guy? Bad casting choice.I feel like the better actors had to sit through this and cringe, knowing they'd be spending months promoting pure garbage, then spending the rest of their careers not talking about this movie.
Skip this movie. Just wait about 15 and hopefully someone better will remake it!! I gave this movie a 3 out of respect for Charlize's acting.",The Old Guard

Also where was the plot? So they go places and do something? They are immortal but for what reason? Just because? I new person is made immortal ah good an explanation must be coming... Nope. The high point was noticing the head of the badly named pharma company Merik just two letters away from the word they stole which was on the back of some interns truck, anyway was in fact Harry potter's cousin!

Also the Antagonist does not fits in the place. Looks like a nerd but is not. All he cares about is money. One thing i liked was the back story which had a great potential, if it was displayed in a bit more detail like what happened to Quynh, how long after did she get out, how did she get out, which i guess they preserved for Second part if there will be any.

I also couldn't help but catch glimpses of her former roles in bits and parts from this movie; for example the "" eating a sandwich while driving through the desert"" scene reminded me of MadMax.Finally, with tears in my eyes and hope in my heart ( that they'll do next one!), i hold this great piece in the top fav ever movies list, while thanking everyone involved in making this marvel spark some joy and sense to our mortal lives.",The Old Guard

Charlize Theron and Kiki layne did great. Having the gay couple doesn't detract from the movie it adds to the story. Would it have been ok if they were straight??

Given his reaction, it would have been more plausible if Charlize's character was a food delivery person and she just brought him a bag with some Taco Bell. I'm sure there's not a Taco Bell anywhere nearby, given the architecture and it would have been quite an expensive delivery.Thanks to this poorly written/acted intro I'll wait until I'm more desperate for entertainment to give this another chance.I would also recommend not watching The Ninth Gate before starting this movie.Also, I usually like movies with Charlize Theron so I hope someone whose opinion I trust tells me that this movie is really good so I can give it another chance.",The Old Guard

Many of us are starved for this kind of representation and it is a huge relief to see it take front and center for a change, and like anyone, woke or not, can complain about seeing Charlize Theron on screen--give me a break.This movie was refreshing, fun, and a fine example of where the genre should be headed.

1434,lukaszslipko,Terrible script and awful dialogues.,3,18 July 2020,"I honestly cant believe how bad this movie was, given that Charlize was onboard. Wrtiting is probably the cheapest aspect of filmmaking and it really sucked. What happened? Did Netflix script doctor had to dumb it down so much? Was he or she afraid that the viewers will lack the brainpower to figure out what is going on and decided they needed to be bombarded with cringeworthy lines delivered without any real emotions every 10 minutes? Really dissapointed.",The Old Guard
1435,The_Almighty_Monky,Terrible Premise,3,18 July 2020,"There are many ways to write a character that has become disenfranchised with a long life.
The people they love are dead, for instance.
The ideal they once served has been corrupted, for another.
Unfortunately the writer(s) of this film attempted to write a story based on reality while simultaneously either ignoring or being ignorant of said reality.
The very idea that someone who lived through the last several hundred years could say, with a straight face, that the world is somehow worse now than it ever was is offensive in every possible way. Near universal abolition of slavery? Nah. Incredible advances in medicine and technology? Pfft. law and order applied to nearly everyone on two continents? Fluff, obviously.
Is the world a perfect place? Of course not. But any narrative that suggests it has been declining rather than improving over the last few centuries only makes the characters look ignorant.",The Old Guard

1457,fmillz,Why the all hate ?,10,7 August 2020,"I'm not sure what all the negative/mediocre reviews are about, but this movie was pretty bad ass as far as I was concerned. I'm gonna rush through my thoughts here in no particular order, just going to ramble as I go. Firstly, Charlize crushes her role per usual and her portrayal of the character worked flawlessly. Each actor had their own role to play and I felt like they all delivered extremely well. The story itself had a good premise and it translated well onto the screen. The fight scenes, although maybe slightly over-stylized, were gritty and brutal and extremely entertaining. Reading some reviews here, I don't see why everyone is saying that this movie is trying to be 'woke' or 'pc'. The cast is diverse, but it's not talked about, shown as an issue, or anything like that. It completely fits in line with the premise. There are a handful of people from 'all over the world' that have the ability that they have. So yes, there should be different races/genders. There was no race classification, monetary/upbringing talk, or anything along those lines. Why people felt the need to read into that as something else I'm not sure. Another thing mentioned in reviews are the two male characters who are in a relationship and how that somehow means they tried 'extra hard' to cater to the LGBTQ+ community. But that was also nothing more than a typical relationship. It was shoved in the viewers face or talked about constantly. It was all actually done pretty subtly and respectfully as far I was concerned. Didn't think it should have offended anyone, on either side of the viewpoint. So anyways, to end this rant of a review, I suggest everyone watch this movie. Enjoy it for what it is. Follow along with the story and characters and you will be pleasantly surprised on how well this movie delivered. Don't read into the different races, sexual preferences, or anything else like that. Take them for what they are, just people from every corner of the earth coming together to do some pretty cool stuff with a very awesome ability to evade death.One last thing, that ending scene ! Sequel please !",The Old Guard
1458,for_allex,Not bad. Need more...,6,9 August 2020,"In generally, it's not entirely clear to me in which direction the filmmakers want to take us. Unfortunately, the film contains a minimum of personal tragedies - I would be glad if the authors of film gave us more backstory, to mention what epochs that heroes lived, to show us more of their experiences - but only Booker talks about the personal here (about his son) and the others seems to have nothing to say? Why should the authors give them such an age then??? Andromache came from Scythia, which means she is about 2000 years old! The authors would be say that they are 100-200 years old and that's enough, and there is no need to squeeze a historical outline into the pauses between shooting.
Also it would be nice to give the film more mysticism - the moment with the iron coffin is really creepy, but unfortunately that's all...
As a result this movie seems to be bang-bang story in ""John Wick"" style, with the grown-up Dudley Dursley, who of course became a villain :)It turns out that the characters not so much lived through historical eras, not accomplished something, not experienced something - but they simply Deadpools.
I hope that the cons of the film will be corrected in the future - okay with the history (this is difficult and there will probably be politicized nonsense), but at least add mystics! This is what Hollywood have over the edge!",The Old Guard

1460,marliearrasmith,Amazing!! Made like an action movie should be.,10,11 August 2020,"Sad to see how many people are complaining about a ""woke"" film. Oh no! A movie with a cast of color and two men who love eachother! Saying that the movie sucks solely because you're butthurt about white, Possibly straight villains or betrayal characters is unfathomable to me.I will agree that the soundtrack felt off at times, and I did notice plot holes, but it's an action film. It's supposed to focus mainly on fighting scenes and intense cinematography. This film has both in the bag. For a lower budget film it's amazing. Nothing frowned upon in modern day is enforced heavily- it's refreshingly normalized, just like how they portray Nicky and Joe well without having to outright state ""hey, these two aren't just really good friends!! They've been in love for millennia, so they're practically attached at the hip understandably.""And a diverse cast is realistic in the sense of immortals from all different ethnicities and places in the world. People are being way too harsh. Great watch if you have 2 hours to spare, and is set up for a sequel!! Can't wait :)",The Old Guard
1461,melissaporteous,Throughly enjoyable,8,15 August 2020,"Yes, there were a couple of bits which were a bit trite or silly, but overall I really enjoyed this film and I'm keen to see a sequel. Charlize Theron is a total badass, as we've come to expect now, and I enjoyed and cared about all the characters. This means I actually cared about the characters at those pivotal dramatic moments, and was invested in the outcome. It was good to see such a varied cast without it feeling forced or full of stereotypes, and they are all very strong actors.The fight scenes were great, and one starkly awful tale allows you to truly appreciate the horror of immortality.I've read some rubbish reviews on here and I just don't get them, it's not a cinematic masterpiece, but it's a great movie and I really want to know what happens next!",The Old Guard

Stupid.",The Old Guard
1463,ninafulep,Great characters,9,22 August 2020,Lovely cast of actors and really well developed set of characters that interact wonderfully with one another. Having men that are portrayed as caring and loving in an action movie is a great way to shake up the genre and show a different side of men than we are used to seeing.not to mention the beautifully portrayed love between joe and nicky which is more believable than many straight romances i've seen in movies lately.minus points for the music which didn't seem to match the tone of movie at times.,The Old Guard
1464,urstanner,Beautiful,7,3 September 2020,"I enjoyed this movie very much; from beginning to end! The best thing in my opinion is, that its not a a movie like superman or hulk, or avangers. Its about human beeings with human behaviour. Its less about special FX and more about characters. The movie highlights aspects like the loneliness and the fact, that you cannot build relationships when you're living forever. Its a movie with heart and real emotions. The action is well paced and the acting is solid. Of course, its no movie for the oscars, but its just really good entertainment. I also liked the soundtrack. It hasn't always to be Hans Zimmer big cinema sound. The music is up to date and fits pretty good to the different scenes. I give this movie a 7.2. rating. And I hope for more to come. Its a lot of potential in this topic and this film shows some aspects of being immortal, that I haven't seen in any other movie. If you are into action movies with some deepness and warmth; you definitely should watsch this. Highly recommended!",The Old Guard

There are so many plot holes.Maybe it would have been a hit if was released in the 90's. A lot of action thrillers are there in the market now and they have repeatedly increased the audience's level of knowledge. But this movie greatly underestimates the IQ level of common people. Even a kid would see the upcoming traps in this film. Why on earth would Charlize Theron act in this stupid script? I only wanted to watch this because of her.

1469,vicktorrone,The best realistic Meta Hero Movie,10,20 September 2020,"A brilliantly Times written and executed film. It shows that the creator and writer of the graphic novel had his hands in writing the film.

And the couple wasn't just Given phrases like: "" He is the love of my life"" . The feelings between the characters where Perfect scripted And acted often without Words.
We are normally Celebrating and have been celebrating the very short short of the female homo- romantic Couple in the very last drags of Star Wars this show of bravery has not been seen in a production this big and without being the main selling part of the film.To conclude this movie combines the very best graphic novel And comic adaptation Without several million worth of special effects which Present when needed but the viewer is not smothered With them.

Characters are well drawn, action is excellent, and there's a real sense of...well, sadness. Reckoning with mortality is about as adult as it gets. So, yes, a superhero movie for adults.
Also, holy representation, Batman! I love Marvel movies buts it's taken them a decade to focus on anything besides white straight men in their movies, and here comes this film, with a white woman, a black woman, and a freakin interracial gay romance smack in the middle of it.

1485,lvagamersquad,Better Than Expected,7,19 September 2021,"I went into this expecting a stupid, action film with a mildly interesting concept to blow it up, but I was pleasently surprised. The action scenes were very well choreographed, and they did actually have more weight to them than I expected.Charlize Theron was great as always, and the rest of the cast definitely held their own. All the characters were believable and likeable throughout and I did care about them all. I also like that the cast was very diverse without being obnoxious or self-congratulatory about it.It wasn't entirely perfect though. I don't personally care for the constant handheld camera shots that this film went with. Thats a personal preference though, and it might not bother others.I think the plot twist near that last quarter was a little contrived and lacked a lot of logic. The villain was also pretty lame. I do think he was supposed to just be a means to an end so we could have more time for the protagonists, but he was pretty annoying.All in all I liked it, flaws in all. I know Netflix is pretty inconsistent in its quality, especially its films, but this one was pretty good. I say, let's have a sequal.",The Old Guard
1486,justinbarron_04,Could have been better.,7,12 July 2020,I enjoyed the premise and the start of the movie but I really disliked some elements of the story. I can never understand why there always has to be a traitor in a crew of people that have known each other forever (literally in this case). There have to either be better ways for them to get captured or they have to set up the doubts better. One throwaway line to explain things is not good enough. I understand wanting there to be a surprise for the audience but by now it becomes expected so it isn't worth it.I also hope that the ending is not setting up for Quynh and Booker to be the enemies in a sequel. I don't think that I could buy any reasoning for him to turn traitor again. I suppose she could be crazy and is going to try to kill them all but I don't know that I find that all that interesting either.I suppose the problem is always the same with immortals. How can there be stakes and what kind of enemy can ever match them? There have certainly been some interesting and original takes on that but I don't think this is one of them.,The Old Guard

Utterly boring apart from the fight scenes (5/10 star) but nothing else, no acting and script to keep you engaged.

1495,Candie18,Interesting Movie,9,13 July 2020,"I quite enjoyed this movie for many differents reasons !First of all I thought the acting was good and took me into the characters' stories.Then I enjoyed the script, the idea of this sci-fi story that really fit into our reality, it's the kind of sci-fi I like (similar to Orphan Black or Sense8 for exemple). All the little references all along the story that gives us clues about the main character are really interesting and I think it's quite necessary to be focused and observant to cacth them (I might have not seen all of them for all I know).As for the directing, I think it was good, really focusing on details with pretty good fighting scenes. It might be a little too much when it comes to graphic and bloody scenes but it's not as bad as many other movies and TV shows that exist today. And yes, I enjoyed the music. To me, it was different from what we expect in that kind of movies. I like new things that are out of the box, and the music in The Old Guard took me to there.Hope there would be the second one.",The Old Guard
1496,jpaulnadeau,What's not to like?,9,11 July 2020,"I thought this movie was very well-made. The storyline was interesting, the characters we are well developed and likeable and the action reminded me of the John Wick movies. I highly recommend this.",The Old Guard
1497,markrgreen66,Perhaps the worst film I've seen in ages,3,16 October 2020,"This is a dull formulaic shoot em up with a week storyline. It might work as a first person video game, but as a film ...
My teenage kids enjoyed it though🙄",The Old Guard
1498,mlaps1979,A decent idea and nothing else.,3,18 July 2020,"Poorly written, poorly cast, poorly acted. The soundtrack was like a screwdriver to the ear. Some decent fights. A dull plot and a story that went nowhere.",The Old Guard
1499,Szekerlacey,Amazing!,10,18 July 2020,Loved the concept and the execution! The actors were on point and the fight scene though jumbled some times were expertly choreographed to look like people who have been fighting for hundreds to thousands of years. The romance between the two male characters was very tastefully done and had excellent chemistry!! I really hope for a sequel!,The Old Guard
1500,manda-0,Very good film.,10,11 July 2020,"Regardless of anyone else's review. This movie had me out of my seat from beginning to end. Although the villain could have been better portrayed, the rest of the cast did fantastic jobs on this film.",The Old Guard
1501,james-stacey,Excellent mix of action and intriguing storyline,9,11 July 2020,"I wasn't familiar with the graphic novel so the twists and turns off the slowly revealed backstory were exciting. I liked the look and feel of this film - it did have a graphic novel aesthetic, which I thought was well executed. Charlize Theron is superb as the battleworn and cynical yet kickass lead. I loved the historical flashbacks and the international settings, which gave the story a universal, almost mythic feel. All in all, I hope they make the sequel that was so clearly set up at the end!",The Old Guard
1502,lillian_danev,Loved it,9,16 July 2020,"I watched this film not knowing much about it except that it starred Charlize Theron and I wasn't disappointed.

Found myself thinking about it the next day. Can't wait for the next one.",The Old Guard

1504,ross-allandean,A great time,8,11 July 2020,"I really enjoyed this film. The story is interesting the characters have depth and the action scenes had me grinning from ear to ear.Let down by a somewhat smug, weasle of a villain but thankfully the rest of the cast outshine him as the story is more about them.
The little character moments in this are fantastic and really flesh out the story. You buy them as a group who have been fighting together for years and the film really gives you a sense of their history.Not every film is supposed the be Citizen Kane, some films are just supposed to be fun.
I hope people watch this as I'd love them to make more.",The Old Guard

1524,pugbuddy12,Great Action Flick,10,12 July 2020,"What I notice from the most negative reviews of this movie is a description of it as a ham-fisted attempt at ""woke-ness."" Frankly, that's nonsense. I have seen PLENTY of movies and TV shows that are clear attempts at profiting off of ""woke-ness."" This movie has a diverse cast of characters featuring TWO black actors, with the rest being white or white-passing. Yes, there is a gay relationship, but the only time it feels sappy is when they are literally professing their love for each other after capture. I don't know, that feels fair, and I've seen plenty of it in heterosexual relationships. So, if you are able to overlook characters who really just happen to be different races/sexual orientations. If you can't, I hope you are willing to do some soul-searching about why a movie that reflects the world's current demographics bothers you so much.",The Old Guard

Loved this adaptation of comic book to film. Filled with action, original storyline, good character development, unique and a desire to follow the possibly ongoing story. I liked it so much, I immediately did some research on it and pre-ordered the next comic book in the series. Hope this one is as good as the original, I can see this turning into a major series based on the comic books. Plenty of twists and turns. Action fans need to check this one out!",The Old Guard

1533,lpage86,Might be more tolerable if KiKi Layne could act at all,3,16 July 2020,Seems like a complete waste to have a bunch of really great actors and actresses and then just throw an actress with absolutely no ability to act. KiKi Layne should be in movies with other terrible actors so it's not so obvious how bad she is.,The Old Guard
1534,caty_amy,A new beginning,10,8 December 2020,"To be completely honest, I postponed watching The Old Guard because I was under the impression that it was a series, not a movie. So by the time I got to it, a whole month had passed. And I should have watched it sooner.It had been a long time since I enjoyed a movie this much. To begin with, the cast is espectacular. Whether we talk about Charlize Theron's Andromache The Scythian, a world-wary warrior who has lost her apreciation for the world, to the inmortal husband's, played by the amazingly talented Luca Marinelli and Marwan Kenzari, every character speaks to you one way or the other. Not to mention the fact that the leads are two brilliant, strong and determined woman, who also show their feelings. Who would have thought that well-rounded, well-written female characters would be so attractive?And then the story. The focus is simple: this people can not die. That does not take away their fears and their doubts, since we soon enough learn that there are worst fates than death for these soldiers.And the action sequences are breath-taking to watch. Sure, we have our fair share of guns, but give me Charlize with a axe any time or Luca Marinelli's Nicolo with his long sword.For once, an action movie has a varied, colorful cast that is appealing to more people than just your average violence-oriented gun-ho addict. And I love it.",The Old Guard
1535,Lumen222,Worst soundtrack ever,6,28 January 2021,"What in the world were they thinking with the pop-dance songs splashed in the middle of intense scenes that are supposed to be dramatic , hardcore ,sad or dark??

Other than that,the movie is meh.",The Old Guard

1541,mike-demetriou,People are Misinformed,8,21 July 2020,"I never write reviews, but I had to speak up on behalf of this film.Others have written about the highlights and issues of the movie. The good parts are obvious: fighting scenes, redemption, etc. I want to address the common complaints though, because I feel the people who focus on them are being unfair.People have pointed out that the antagonist is a cartoon-like evil character, that there are cliché betrayal and feel-good moments, and that there's a lot of cinematic fighting. I'm pretty sure these people are unaware of a critical piece of information, or at least they're forgetting it when complaining about these aspects: this is an adaptation of a GRAPHIC NOVEL!Of course there's going to be a villainous character and extensive fighting scenes. When you keep the origins of the film in mind, those aspects should neither surprise you nor bother you. If they bother you, you just don't like graphic novel-to-film adaptations and should move on without being offended that it didn't live up to some expectations it was never created to meet.

1555,kooseul,"Racists, misogynists, and homophobes hate this movie.",9,12 July 2020,"Racists, misogynists, and homophobes hate this movie. It has everything they cannot stand. Two leads of the movie are female and one of them is even black. Two supporting leads are gay, main characters of this movie are ethnically very diverse. And what's worse, this damn movie is directed by a black female director. There's no chance some people can stand this movie. I understand that. If any of the things I listed above usually turns you off, don't bother.This is one of the slickest action flick I've seen in a while. The action sequences are very dynamic and fresh albeit a bit gory and violent. But hey, wasn't that the main reason we seek action movies? Actors's performances are rock solid. Theron is one of the most convincing action star in Hollywood, but what impressed me more was the new one, Layne. She's completely new to the scene, but very convincing and her body's been fit to the role. Supporting characters are 3 dimensional and relatable. They rarely have empty lines for the filler jokes as the side kicks usually do in many action movies. This may be a reason some people find it boring. It's not Die Hard.The plot is clever. The concept of ""old guard"" is so old that I can hardly think of any fresh plot. I am 50 years old. I've seen Highlander to Ajin. But they did it. (Or the original material did it. This movie is an adaptation of a graphic novel.) What I like most about this film is that it is paced fast enough to be a cool action flick but still delivers drama. I've seen the director's previous works. She knows how to deliver emotions without tears, cries, or slow motions.This is an action movie. Many people have certain habits while watching especially action flicks. They watch eating snacks, not paying much attention to details and dialogues. Some even skip parts characters just talk. Action movie makers know that, too. On the other hand, I like watching movies immersed and I treat all movies the same. So I get bothered by some action movie's lack of details and drama. The Old Guard didn't have that. I watched the movie fully enjoying. I want to suggest you try the same for this movie. I think that way you might enjoy the movie more.",The Old Guard

1574,sadrans,The soundtrack nearly ruins the entire film,5,9 January 2021,This is a solid B-movie with schlocky comic book writing and fun action scenes. It would be fine if not for the god-awful soundtrack full of songs with zero musical merit.,The Old Guard
1575,casperververs,Very good movie,8,17 July 2020,"Love the movie, high quality, good acting. Not a basic story and lots of funny/random action moments",The Old Guard
1576,rikkiloney1,Overall good....,6,25 January 2021,"This overall was a good movie, it was a good start and then hit a show patch that wasn't needed. Has lots of potential to have more movies... but one thing that was the worst part for me was the acting from the chief villain.... awful and cringey",The Old Guard

1578,frances-823-91929,Terrible acting,3,16 July 2020,"Throughout the movie, the terrible acting by some actors just made it so hard to actually enjoy the movie, since you were constantly reminded that they were actually playing a role. This could be in part due to Charlize Theron outshining her fellow actors due to her talent, as her role felt so genuine against the fake and bad acting of other actors in the same scene. A better choice of cast in conjugation with less cliche moments and a better soundtrack would make this movie so much better but unfortunately a quite interesting storyline was lost and not worth watching.",The Old Guard

1580,mrkittke,"Great Characters , Some not so Great plot",8,10 July 2020,"Dont get me wrong the movie had my attention the minute it started so at that point it was great , never once did I get bored.But there where some things I didn't like as much some of the fights didn't feel meaningful for example especially nearing the end of the movie.What I did like was how the characters where build up it wasn't the typical put a poc or an lgbt person in the movie for diversity , they were well writen with each their own life's that weren't stereotypical , very enjoyable.
The international cast really helped pull this movie togheter made it way more realistic to feel with the characters and their backgrounds.At the end do happen some interesting things , which could lead to a nice sequel or spin-off.Some plot lines in thje movie were rushed tho and could have been more of use in a series to go more in depth on some of the plots then in a movie.
For a typical fantasy/action movie set in current times it's a fun watch.",The Old Guard
1581,DanielEidi,So much potential wasted,6,13 January 2021,"Great acting, highly entertaining action, cool plot idea, above average plot, one-dimensional characters, abundance of plot holes, tasteless score.

I want to buy the soundtrack asap.I love Charlize Theron & all of the other actors were great. But I did notice a problem with the sound in some areas.

1584,navneet-shaunak,Disappointed,5,14 July 2020,"You have a star cast and a plot to create a perfect action movie but then you create this old junk with not enough juice. Not even Charlize Therone could save this disaster.Movie starts with promise but slowly gets confused between matter of mortal or immortal. Same old pharma villain(comical you can read) eyeing for big price of immortality, bit of actions here and there and ending with returning of old friend(Might be a foe if they are planning for sequel which I doubt). Very predictive. one time watch if you dont have anything to do in this lockdown",The Old Guard

The motives that sway the character's decisions are flimsy at best, laughable in truth. The ending is awful, the writing is poor and mundane. I'm honestly flabbergasted.

1599,lesleyanne-83-73355,Go for it,9,14 July 2020,I really enjoyed this film. Plenty of action and not spoiled by gratuitous romance. The only romance is subtle and not in your face. I really liked the soundtrack and will be adding some of it to my Spotify. I'm a woman in my 50s and it ticked the boxes for me. Some reviews are hyper critical. Enjoy it. I did.,The Old Guard
1600,jahsb,Good and bad,6,20 July 2020,"I'll start with the bad:
1. Dialogue - too many cheesy one liners
2. Music - songs felt out of place or nailing the nail on the head. Would have preferred more orchestral score
3. Villain - waaaay too over the top and cartoonish, sorry DudleyThe good:
1. The action
2. Charlize Theron and the rest of the actors portraying ""The Old Guard""
3. Joe and Nicky love story - Immortal warriors whose love transcends time brought successfully by amazing acting and chemistry of Marwan Kenzari & Luca MarinelliI suspect having the writer who wrote the graphic novel write the screenplay was both a blessing and a curse. I heard the movie is pretty faithful to the graphic novel (I never read), but just didn't translate well to film. Nevertheless, I did enjoy it overall, but thanks more to strong acting by the heroes. They had great chemistry in conversation and in their fight scenes. I hope they learn what worked and what didn't in this one to make the sequel better.",The Old Guard

1603,hotdaddywags,Missed Opportunity,5,23 July 2020,"The premise is actually pretty cool. And I'll watch anything with Charlize Theron because she's a great actress and a mega-babe but her talents are wasted here. Cliches and painful bits of dialogue abound. Plus it bogs down so brutally in the middle you find yourself asking if you really even care, which is always the death knell. Some of the action is pretty cool but on the whole it's a whiff. Oh and yeah. The music blows.",The Old Guard
1604,thepopculturemanifesto,Great movie,10,10 July 2020,"This movie was really great. We didn't know anything going in, and I think the movie did a great job of dropping you into the world and giving enough information to hit the ground running and pushing straight into the story.",The Old Guard
1605,kimberlysmoore,Good for a movie night.,7,1 October 2020,"The story line was easy, simple, no real twists or surprises. Good ""movie night"" movie.
My only complaint was the earrings.
If the body is pushing out bullets to heal the holes, it would do the same with earrings and piercings. They would heal instantly and push the foreign object out of the holes.
I had another small issue in the beginning of the film but the earring thing bothered me so much, I forgot.",The Old Guard

I'm looking forward to the next one.,The Old Guard
1607,shafaq-qureshi,The Old Guard : Realistic version,8,15 July 2020,"Even though the script was expected but the execution was brilliantly done as an introduction to the sequel. Charlize Theron, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari and Luca Marinelli played the characters so well and gelled perfectly as the immortal warriors. Charlize Theron made the fight scenes look effortless in fact all the fight sequences were well thought of and beautifully captured.
I love that the fight sequences were used to highlight the immortal warriors fighting as one. I personally love the small details such as passing the shotgun during the first fight scene and if I have to pick a favourite fight sequence it would be Charlize Theron and Kiki Layne one.It seems that this movie was intened to be a brief introduction to all the characters and the sequel will have more depth to each of the characters back stories rather than teasers of their past. Over all it is a fast paced movie with beautifully choreographed action sequences, a more realistic twist to the comic.",The Old Guard

Charlize Theron is 100% an action heroin though. She will go down as the John McLean of action actresses and she is the only dim glitter of light at the end of this terrible piece of trash.

This seems to be in same universe as 'The Man from the Earth' (but totally opposite genre), but here its like John Wick is the immortal one. I always like such sci-fi topics and adding action to it takes it to high level and had high hopes considering the plot and starcast.
Theron was superb, no doubt about it, but others in her team were there only for showing attendance. The villain had no clear motive or power (except money) which also makes storyline weak as compared to the immortal team.
There were multiple plot holes, which makes the Movie weak and questions the direction.Was very excited to watch this but got disappointed.Considering this to be first in a series, giving 6 rating for acting and action sequences.Hope if this goes for a sequel and Andy's oldest friend become the main antagonist then it will be fun to watch.

I forgot what goes on and why in the middle of movie just that they are special and being hunted. The ending was like an introduction to a series, but actually don't think it will. The concept is actually really interesting, but they talk about it in the movie really not that much. To sum up, it easy too watch with friends, beer and snack, some laugh.

It brought back memories of watching The Highlander as a teen, but I think this movie was better executed.Charlize Theron does a wonderful job as a tired old warrior, and Chiwetel Ejiofor is brilliant as usual.

1641,jchanman,Decent movie but not great. Borderline if it's even good,4,12 July 2020,I'm down with immortality but way too many other scenes are plain not realistic. The major one being the Charlize Theron who is supposed to be millennia old and a combat and weapons expert somehow doesn't know she is handed an empty gun. My 14 year old nephew has shot less than 10 times in his life immediately knew a gun was empty when he picked it up. But somehow she didn't? Yea you lost me there such a completely ignorant miss just doesn't sit well with me. Add that into dozens of other smaller issues and this is decent at best 4/10,The Old Guard
1642,vejutzdaniel,"Gave it a 6 because it got me interested enough to see the sewquel (will there be one, though?)",6,17 July 2020,"First of all, the movie got off on the wrong foot with me because of its ""in your face"" agenda. No matter what you believe or not believe, art can't be art if you apply such horrible bounds to it. In my opinion, a movie will NEVER be good if it has such a clearly established agenda.
Secondly, the soundtrack was, in my opinion, totally unsuitable. It was like a 14-year-old had to select the music and just added in their favorite songs. And don't get me wrong, I don't really mind cliche fight scenes with cheap energetic music in the background, as long as it keeps you on your toes. But the soundtrack in this movie failed even at that.Something that I didn't really mind as much as other users: the bad guy really is a bit too much. And I don't think it's the acting. The script just had all those cheesy bad guy lines, like in a bad 90's comic. But like I said, I could live with that.Now for the good stuff. The story managed to get my attention enough for me to want to see a part 2. The concept, at least, is worth a part 2. I'm hoping they'll manage to only keep the good stuff, though.The acting wasn't bad at all, in my opinion. I think they all did a pretty good job, given what they had to work with.To sum up, this is, for me, at least, the kind of movie that has a good premise, starts off quite horribly, but then manages to redeem itself just enough to be worth a second chance.

So one of the immortals (can't remember the name), supposedly after hundreds of years, believes that it would be a good idea to expose them to experimentations, like seriously? And couldn't they have picked better hideouts? I mean come on, a cave??? You are the oldest living beings and you have a cave for a hideout. Ok I admit that maybe the cave provides better cover because it is not listed anywhere as belonging to someone but still. And to pick a hideout that is in a noisy area? How is that a good thing when you are hiding from people, you will never hear them coming with all that noise. I just couldn't connect with any of them.

Except that it wasn't lived up to it's full potential.
It's better suited as a series than a movie because in the movie, the villian is a villain because he's a villain. There's no reason why except for the fact that he owns a pharmaceutical company. That's it.
I want this plot to dig deep into why villian is the villian.

1666,neit-93016,Good movie but it would have been better as a pilot.,8,12 July 2020,"It looks like a pilot of a serie more than a movie.
The main plot is believable and solid but a bit basic, it seems an excuse to introduce the characters and to set the universe and the characterizations and the backstories have too much to say for one movie, which has left me with the burning desire to know more about everything.
Anyway I've pretty much everything but the music.
The worldbuilding is very charming, the immortal protagonists are shaped like very old living being in a credible way, they are in touch with every age they have lived in, you can see they have a long history bout they don't seem anachronistic.
I love the mixed range of weapons, my fav one is the battle axe. Their origin stories are the most interesting thing in the movie and I wish to see more of them in a sequel. Their functioning, limits and strengths define a realistic specie than bunch of magic people.
The characters are very interesting and remarkable, yet relatable. The gay couple are my favourite ones, they have excellent chemistry, they're very charismatic and 100% humans, free of all annoying ""tragic hero"" tropes that plague all characters of that sort of movies.
The other characters unfortunately have a few of these tropes, but they're very good anyway. All main characters are badass, enough nuanced, dynamic and fun to watch.
Too bad the villain is actually a plot device, his motives are life-like and rational but he's too much stereotypically evil in a cartoonish way. Like I said the movie would be a excellent pilot and this weak villain would work well as a random villain for a intro plot.
The narrative pace works for me, I appreciated the abundance of dialogue, it has made me care for the characters and the action scene were well dosed and very entertaining.
There are some plot twists, all of them solid but very ""classic"".
The music was downright awful LOL, cheap pop songs totally unrelated with the scenes and the characters.
Anyway, I'd like to see a sequel or -better- a TV serie based on this movie (and the comic).",The Old Guard
1667,paulomiguelraimundo,Ups and downs,9,12 July 2020,"Yes...soundtrack could be better.
Yes...slow pace in terms of story, but you have some teasers here and there.For me this was a refreshing movie, with big potential to get some sequels.
I haven't researched if this is based of a book, but I enjoyed the idea.
I also felt what the characters where going through, the little bits of background on Andy gave me some idea of what she was suffering all those years.
There is room to develop and introduce much more from the other ""temporary immortals"" and the new organization that will be born in the end.
The fight scenes where John Wick standard and that is what we should expect nowadays.
I do hope the sequels to be as entertaining as this one, and do use the backstory as well the philosophical ideas that could be presented in this kind of story.Cutting it short, I gave a 9 because of the potential in the story telling in this modern highlander.",The Old Guard

Background noise world randomly cut in and out. Music would jump in then quit. The in-scene voices weren't miced right to account for room noise.

How this has a 6.7 currently is beyond me.The premise seemed a bit campy, but I didn't have high expectations going in other than a reasonably entertaining action movie. Wrong!Everything about this movie is unlikable: characters, story, dialogue, acting and oh my god the music... This is legit perhaps the worst, out of touch soundtrack I've ever heard in a movie.The characters are completely unlikable. Supposedly they're hundreds of years old, but yet they behave like a bunch of angsty teenagers. The way they behave is completely nonsensical. They essentially abduct the new black girl, yet only give her an attitude and FIGHT her instead of explaining why. Baffles the mind really who approved this...The plot-holes are out of this world as well. They kidnap 2 of the guys from ""the old guard"", who then manage to overpower 4 ARMED guards who are sitting in the car with them. Yet, instead of taking the weapons and blow everyone away when the doors of the car are opened. They simply hand themselves over with some cringey a witty comment.The movie tries way too hard to be PC, emotional and smart. But it fails miserably on all ends. Complete garbage, avoid at all costs.",The Old Guard

1689,tattaichinionto,Doesn't make sense for what characters do,3,24 July 2020,"Premise of the movie in general was interesting and I was hooked after seeing the opening scene. Afterwards though, saw several stupid character actions that I find it hard to believe real people with common sense and a bit of critical thinking would do...Why would the gay couple take everyone out in the truck but not arm themselves afterwards? They literally sit there for the people to open the truck, bring them to the plane, and then take them to the building before they're knocked out. That's too many opportunities to NOT escape after it was shown they can handle themselves.The reason for why the guy betrays the team doesn't make sense. He figures if they were to be studied they'd be able to find out a way to end it. As in, turn all 4 of them into lab rats all for the woman. But surprise surprise, it doesn't work out as well as he thought it would at the black guy's house.The black guy seriously believing that the white CEO's motive is purely for science and not profit and that he wouldn't have any ill intentions. Ignore the fact that since the beginning when he was shown the video, he repeated over and over about competitors catching wind of info on the immortals. His whole motivation of thinking it would be the end of disease and suffering is also stupid.
All of that and a few more things just made it harder and harder to watch the longer it went.",The Old Guard

I wasn't sure what to expect after the opening scene, I was afraid it'd be another mindless shooter and I was glad to be proven wrong.The entire cast is interesting enough (besides the main antagonist that was a bit flat) to get invested in them. There are not that many fights for an action movie, and each one is in completely different settings so they don't feel too repetitive. I liked the soundtrack, it was unusual, I think it really fit the mood of the movie. The pacing was okay.What I enjoyed the most were the conversations between characters, they are short and they fit the pacing, but they add a lot of emotion and stakes and they really highlight that these people were together for a really long time, they feel genuinely close. It was more interesting than getting an infodump on each of them, instead, we were just shown their relationships. I loved the little bits of memories and I wish they did more of them. The romantic couple is really sweet, even though it's not *about* their love, it's just another aspect of the movie and I think that's a great way to tell their story.It deals with heavy topics, but I didn't feel like it was a ""dark and gritty"" movie, it manages to keep on bringing the tone up.I would recommend it. :)",The Old Guard

I actually think that the trailers did in a disservice because this isn't some run of the mill action film with tropes and superhuman skills. Every character was fleshed out and had their own journey. This film's power is in the time that it spends in between the action while also offering a heart-stopping good time.

The story is very light and feels like a good introduction to the core of the franchise. Actions are very entertaining. I also love how they touch on how 'love' is when you're someone who lives thousand of years together with another person. Also the loneliness aspect of immortality and how the weight of being left alone is something that's worse than a physical punishment.Characters are really likeable and have lots of potential but sadly there's no room to flesh them out.
