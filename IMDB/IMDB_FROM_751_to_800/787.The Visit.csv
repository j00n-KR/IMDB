0,TheLittleSongbird,"The odd and creepy, the very odd and creepy and 'The Visit'",5,1 February 2017,"M Night Shyamalan is one inconsistent director, with films that have fallen on both extreme sides of the film spectrum. The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender', 'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.The good news is that his latest film, 'The Visit' is Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village', which mostly was a decent film let down badly by the twist. However, judging from what had been said to me prior to watching, expectations were to see Shyamalan making a return to form. Instead, 'The Visit' was a film that is certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes, due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor), it is worth visiting and about mid-spectrum Shyamlan along with 'The Village' and 'Signs' but not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense'.Starting with the good things, 'The Visit' does boast a mostly deft mix of chilling tension, genuine scares that really unsettle you and wonderfully weird comedy. The performances are very good. Not since 'The Sixth Sense' has there been more natural and compellingly real child performances in a Shyamalan film (in this regard he has also varied, achieving brilliance with Haley Joel Osment in 'The Sixth Sense' but also abominable depths with Jaden Smith in 'After Earth'), Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould do a truly great job here. Even better are Peter McRobbie and particularly Deanna Dunagan, chilling as the grandparents.Production design, lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere. The story is mostly deliberate but with enough to absorb because the creepiness is so effective often. The use of music doesn't jar at least and Shyamalan does more than capably building up and on the scares and tension.On the other hand, the twist is not that hard to guess (and to me guessable early on) and not only is the execution of it contrived but it is revealed too prematurely which does affect some of the momentum of the last 30 minutes. Shymalan's films, even his bad films, mostly have good production values to their merit, but the cinematography in 'The Visit' looks cheap, almost amateurish. It adheres to the self-filmed documentary-like style but the excessive shakiness of the camera does exhaust, irritate and nauseate the viewer.While delivering on the atmosphere and enough of the story, the script is sloppy at best and often toe-curlingly weak. There is a lot of forced melodrama, frustrating character decisions and inconsistencies (the mother), overexposed, irritating and quite frankly often pointless and out of place rapping and the children talking like wannabe university students (am aware that there are children in existence who act and speak beyond their years, speaking as one myself a decade ago but not in this awkward-sounding a manner).On the whole, worthwhile and not a bad film but not the return to form that was expected. This said mid-quality-spectrum Shyamalan is infinitely more preferable to the four awful films that he directed before it post-'The Village'. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Visit
1,Leofwine_draca,Creepy found footage horror from M. Night Shyamalan,6,20 September 2017,"THE VISIT is an example of the found footage horror film which gets by thanks to original twists on the premise and some inventive moments. It's a slow-burning creeper in which a couple of kids go off to stay with their grandparents only to be disturbed by some very strange behaviour indeed. As with SPLIT, this film's directed by M. Night Shyamalan and the end result is far more interesting than the rest of his work of the last ten years.I do like found footage films so I may be predisposed towards it. I liked this film's pace and the psychological twists are well done; the scary moments are funny, macabre, and inventive, more so than your typical jump scares you see in too many movies these days. The story suffers from having a really annoying male kid as the lead, but the girl is good and the elderly actors are very effective for their part. It's not a masterpiece, but it'll do.",The Visit
2,SnoopyStyle,M. Night returns,6,28 January 2017,"Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) have never met their grandparents. Their mother Loretta Jamison (Kathryn Hahn) left home at 19 and has not talked to her parents since. Out of the blue, they call her up. She sends her kids to stay at her parents' Pennsylvanian farm. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) seems amiable and lovely at first. The kids find them acting more and more strange as the days go on.M. Night Shyamalan is returning to a small indie this time. I like the premise and him aiming at a lower target. I hope he's sharpening his skills. There are some good horror moves and some fun in this. The ending lacks a more intense thrill. I actually wish he had put in aliens. The lack of a home run swing leaves the finish feeling empty. It's nice that M. Night is trying again but he's not all the way back yet.",The Visit
3,Horst_In_Translation,Possessed? Insane? Or just old?,8,30 October 2015,"Let us start with the plot of this 94-minute movie: A woman decides to go on a travel with her boyfriend, so she agrees to let her two children visit her estranged parents during her absence. The kids are off to the grandparents and the mother is off with her new boyfriend. Now this could be an actually harmonic time for everybody, but I got bad news: The writer and director is M. Night Shyamalan. If you know him, you know you will be seeing thriller and horror for the rest of the movie. And the fact that the kids are trying to make a connection between their mother and their grandparents again is the least dramatic thing waiting for you.I know the writer and director has gotten lots of criticism for his recent works, but I've always liked him and especially enjoyed his film ""Signs"". I have not seen the films that received the worst reviews, so I cannot say he is back to greatness for me here, just that this was a really good movie. The actress who plays the mother does not have too many scenes, but she is good when she is on screen. The two actors who play the grandparents are absolutely awesome and the two kid actors do a fine job as well. It certainly shows that they have quite some experience despite their young ages. The first hour of this movie was merely good, but the last half hour was simply great with all the horror, all the chilling aspects and finally the explanation what exactly was going on. I am not saying the first hour was bad, but it just wasn't as good as the last chapter, which also had a touch of ""Funny Games"" to it. Still it had some pretty good moments (like the Hansel/Gretel reference with the oven) and was filled with suspense too. Also I would like to say it's good they did not push this towards the 110-minute mark, but kept it very essential instead. Nice focus here.This is one of the best 2015 films I have seen so far and a definite contender for best horror movie of the year. The camera plot also adds a lot. I like this kind of movies. Also really love ""The Blair Witch Project"". Thumbs up for Mr. M. Night Shyamalan. He very much delivered with this one here and I am optimistic about his future. No doubt he still has it. This film is the evidence. Excellent watch and I highly recommend it. Also a great choice for Halloween right now.",The Visit
4,Prismark10,The big bad wolves,5,24 April 2017,"M Night Shymalan goes back to basics with a low budget feature so he can wrest creative control from the big studios.The Visit is really a modern twisted fairy-tale with dark humour but like many Shymalan films the pace is deliberately slow with the movie only hitting its stride once the twist is revealed.Two teenaged siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are sent by their mother (Kathryn Hahn) to stay with their grandparents for a week. They have never met their grandparents before and kids plan to film a documentary about their visit.The mother reveals that she has not spoken to their grandparents for years as they disapproved of getting married to their father.The grandparents Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie), live in a remote farmhouse and tell Becca and Tyler of certain rules. Never go into the basement because it contains toxic mould and bedtime is at 9:30 pm after which they should not leave the bedroom.During the course of their stay Becca and Tyler notice their grandparents displaying strange and even frightening behaviour which leads them to Skype their mum and pleading that she picks them up.The film has a found footage element as the kids film their encounter but despite good acting from the young actors the pacing was just too slow rendering the film dull. The twist might be obvious to some but at least it leads to the children being genuinely in peril.",The Visit
5,claudio_carvalho,Awful and Annoying,2,15 January 2016,"The teenager Becca (Olivia DeJonge), who wants to be a filmmaker, and her younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), who wants to be a rapper, live with their single mother (Kathryn Hahn) that left home many years ago and has estranged parents. One day, their grandparents invite them to spend a week in their farm and they accept the invitation to let their mother travel alone with her boyfriend. Becca decides to make a documentary of their visit and Tyler and she are welcomed by their grandparents. Soon they note the weird behavior of Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) and they believe the reason is their old age. Nana accidentally damages the camera of Becca's notebook and they contact their mother only using the audio. When she fixes the device, they discover a dark and disturbing secret about their grandparents.""The Visit"" is a horror film with a good story. Unfortunately, the awful direction and screenplay, camera work and cinematography associated to the annoying wannabe rapper character Tyler makes this film unbearable. There is only one good moment when Mon tells the secret about the grandparents to Becca and Tyler. The rest, M. Night Shyamalan is absolutely overrated as usual in another garbage this time in the found footage style. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): ""A Visita"" (""The Visit"")",The Visit
6,nogodnomasters,Jesus Becca. I'm blind.,7,19 January 2018,"Young wanna-be rapper Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and his sister Becca (Olivia DeJonge) go visit their grandparents in remote ""no bars"" Masonville, Pa. There was an incident where their mom (Kathryn Hahn) left home. We don't know what it was, this is mystery number 1. Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) and Nana (Deanna Dunagan) are happy to see their grandchildren. The kids film everything, this is another hand held feature. The kids are given two rules: Do not go into the basement...mold. Mystery 2. And don't come out of your room after 9:30, short lived mystery 3.The grandparents seem nice and normal at times and at other times they have to deal with various old age diseases which makes their behavior seem odd, but the excuse is, they are just old.The ending was a herky jerky camera which gave us a long view of Olivia DeJonge's sweater, but even a perv like me wished they just had a better angle on the events. Tyler decides to use female singers in lieu of curse words as we hear him say ""Katy Perry"" et al. at odd times. This made the film slightly humorous, something it needed. The action typical builds as things get weirder as mysteries are solved.Guide: 2 F-bombs. No sex. Rear nudity (Deanna Dunagan)",The Visit
7,kosmasp,Night comeback (?),6,27 September 2016,"Since the Sixth Sense M. Night got a lot of heat for whatever came after that. Some of that criticism was more or less on him, trying to catch lightning in a bottle again. Giving us twists we didn't want to see, but also not having a powerful impact anymore on the viewer. Some of it is perception and needing the same, while actually wanting something different from the viewing audience standpoint.Now this tries to get back to the roots but twisting them a bit. By making it ""Found Footage"", by giving us two rather than 1 child actor. Twists still intact and I'd say working too. But while Haley was great in Sixth Sense, the same cannot be said about the boy in this one. And it's not even his fault alone. He gets a role where he intentionally has to be annoying. Pretty sure he had fun playing that (also his ""rap"" thing he does), but it can be distracting. Which is almost a shame, because you have many powerful moments here.So while this isn't his best one, it's still a very strong entry and may help him get back on his feet (directing wise).",The Visit
8,Sleepin_Dragon,My heart sank. Great story.,8,19 October 2015,"Now I am the first to admit you have to be in the mood for one of M Night Shyamalan's films. He intentionally tries to throw you off guard when you are watching one of hid films, you constantly question if all is as it should be, or quite simply is he messing with you.I had ignored all info, trailers and chat about this film, as with all his movies once you know what's going on they change somehow, it's the first for a little while of M's films I can say I really enjoyed.I won't go into too much of the plot, a single woman estranged from her parents receives an online message from them, she allows her two kids, Becca and Tyler to stay with their grandparents for a week. The kids use the experience to make a film, some behaviour they capture is rather inexplicable.Excellent acting, but it's the kids that steal the show, I really thought they were brilliant.At one point in the film my heart truly sank, I felt uneasy being the viewer, I felt powerless, and for that reason I give this film an 8, it's been a while since a movie has done that to me. A bit slow for the first twenty minutes, but the ending is worth the wait.",The Visit
9,jboothmillard,The Visit,5,25 October 2018,"It had been a long while since director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) had made a decent or worthwhile movie, notably bad films he made included The Village, Lady in the Water, The Happening, and The Last Airbender, well, he earned a Razzie nomination for the ""Redeemer Award"" with this scary movie, which I was looking forward to. Basically two siblings from Philadelphia, fifteen-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and thirteen-year-old Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), are preparing for a five-day visit with their grandparents while their divorced mother Loretta (Kathryn Hahn) goes on a cruise with her boyfriend. Loretta reveals she has not spoken to her parents in fifteen years, as they disapproved of her marrying her high school teacher. Having never met their grandparents before, the teenagers plan to record a documentary about their visit using camcorders. Becca and Tyler meet their grandparents, referred to as ""Nana"" (Deanna Dunagan) and ""Pop Pop"" (Peter McRobbie), at a train station. Arriving at their farmhouse, they are told never to go into the basement because it contains mould, and it is bedtime 9:30pm every evening, after which they shouldn't leave their room. The first night, after bedtime, Becca goes downstairs for something to eat and is frightened when she sees Nana projectile vomiting all over the house. She tells Pop Pop, who dismisses this, saying Nana suffers stomach flu, and reminds her not to leave their bedroom after 9:30pm. Over the next few days, Becca and Tyler notice their grandparents exhibiting more strange and disturbing behaviour. Tyler walks into the shed and finds a huge pile of soiled adult diapers, Nana tells them that Pop Pop suffers uncontrollable and embarrassing incontinence and was hiding it. Becca asks Nana about the day Loretta left home, and Nana begins to shake and scream. Later, Pop Pop and Nana are confronted by a woman who joined them in counselling, she goes with them into the backyard, but it never seen leaving. Concerned about recent events, Tyler decides to secretly film what happens downstairs at night, but Nana discovers the hidden camera, takes a knife, and tries unsuccessfully to break into the children's locked bedroom. Becca and Tyler view the camera footage of Nana with the knife, and video message Loretta, begging her to come get them. They show Loretta images of her parents, and she panics and says they are not her parents, she promises she will come and get them, and will call the police. The teenagers now realise they have been with strangers all week, they try to leave the house, but Nana and Pop Pop trap them inside and force them to play Yahtzee. Later, Becca sneaks into the basement to investigate, there she finds the corpses of the real grandparents, along with uniforms from the mental hospital at which they worked, revealing the impostors as escaped patients. Pop Pop grabs Becca and imprisons her in his bedroom with Nana, who tries to eat her, while he torments Tyler psychologically by smearing his face with his dirty diaper. Becca fatally stabs Nana with a glass shard from a broken mirror, then runs into the kitchen and attacks Pop Pop. He gains the upper hand, but Tyler knocks him to the floor and kills him by repeatedly slamming the refrigerator door onto his head. The teens escape outside unharmed, where they are met by their mother and police officers. In the aftermath, Becca asks Loretta about what happened the day she left home, she says that she and her parents had a major argument, during which she hit her mother and was struck by her father. Loretta ignored any attempts for her parents to try and get in touch with her, she concludes reconciliation may have happened if she wanted it to. Also starring Celia Keenan-Bolger as Stacey, Samuel Stricklen as Conductor, Patch Darragh as Dr. Sam and Jorge Cordova as Miguel. Presented as another ""found footage"" movie, it is obviously trying to go somewhere toward the reputation of The Blair Witch Project, it also has the annoying moments with the teenage boy doing on-the-spot raps, apart from these little niggles, it is simple and scary stuff, as you slowly realise the estranged relatives are not who they appear, first nice and cuddly, then being weird and terrifying, the twist works pretty well, and the shocks are effective enough, so it all adds up to a reasonable horror. Worth watching!",The Visit
10,BA_Harrison,Old people are weird.,8,26 October 2017,"After the wonderful double-whammy of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, director M. Night Shyamalan started on a downward spiral from which many thought he would never claw his way back. The Visit isn't quite a return to the brilliance of his first two films, but it is a significant step in the right direction.Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould play siblings Becca and Tyler, who go to spend a week with the grandparents they have never met, their mother having left home acrimoniously at nineteen and never returned. Travelling by train, the kids are met at the station by 'Pop pop' (Peter McRobbie) and 'Nana' (Deanna Dunagan) who are excited to meet their grandchildren. Everything is fine at first, but as the days go by, the elderly couple exhibit increasingly bizarre behaviour, all caught on video by aspiring film-maker Becca, who is documenting the whole visit.This being a Shyamalan thriller, there is the obligatory twist to catch viewers off guard, and it works well enough, but the film doesn't rely solely on its unexpected revelation to succeed: the cast are excellent, the atmosphere is genuinely creepy throughout, the tension slowly escalating to a nail-biting climax, and for once, the found-footage/documentary format doesn't feel at all forced.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the freakiest game of Yahtzee ever, and for the gag-inducing 'shitty adult-diaper in the face' scene.NB If you're impressed by the two young stars of The Visit, check them out in the excellent Better Watch Out (2016). They're definitely two to keep an eye on.",The Visit
11,michaelRokeefe,Shyamalan does it again!,8,4 August 2016,"Director/writer M. Night Shyamalan shares the fright once again. Fan or not, you will be drawn to THE VISIT. A single mom (Kathryn Hahn) thinks it a good idea to send her kids Becka (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbough), to their grandparents for a week long visit. These kids in some ways seem like typical teens and of course you immediately know that they are a pain in the butt. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and old Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) live on an isolated Pennsylvania farm, that leaves the siblings little to do, but work on a video documentary of their visit. Nana and Pop Pop are a bit peculiar; damn right strange. These kids aren't dumb and it is not hard to figure out that their grandparents are engaged in some pretty dark deeds. This visit will be creepy, chilling and a down right disturbing nightmare. Remember Granny's rules: Have a great time. Eat all you want. Don't leave your room after dark!",The Visit
12,hitchcockthelegend,A grand time of things at the grandparents place?,7,21 January 2017,"The Visit is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn. Becca and Tyler have never met their grandparents, their mother left that family home in acrimonious circumstances. Now the kids are off to spend a few days with them - and get far more than they bargained for. If you ask some people then they will say that Shyamalan never had form to begin with, so to them this doesn't warrant being called some sort of return to form, what it does do is find him on sound footings. Veering away from big budgets and adopting a low-fi approach, this very much has him back in the spooky zone. It's all very nutty of course, the premise and the (very good) reveal are hardly genre defining, but the unease is palpable, the mystery element strong and there's a bunch of genuinely freaky scenes. The last third is almost delirious as the story goes through its bad dream fairy tale throes, and the small cast are excellent, with Syamalan once again showing how good he works with young actors. A good honest chiller that isn't purporting to be anything other than that. 7/10",The Visit
13,Theo Robertson,It Improves As It Goes Along Which Isn't Saying A Lot,6,29 December 2015,"M Night Unpronoucable name ? Is he still making films ? Is he allowed to still make films ? He is ? , just not with other peoples money ? Makes sense since he's been producing one flop-buster after another so I'm guessing THE VISIT is a result of not being able to raise enough finance rather than any artistic reason . At least camcorder / lost footage movies don't cost much The downside is that this sub-genre is very self limiting . In other words when you've seen one you've effectively seen them all . They start off slow and mundane and slowly wratch up the chills and scares . This one doesn't get off to a good start with a couple of young teens called Becca and Tyler sent off to visit their maternal grandparents . I don't want to sound like a xenophobic Eurocentric but these two teens don't strike me as your typical American teens . They both come out with words that will have you reaching for a dictionary and Tyler occasionally uses British idioms like ""Bloke"" . Maybe M , Night whathisface originally wrote this in a British setting and forgot to rewrite it for the Stateside setting or maybe it was ghost written by the late Christopher Hitchens ? Regardless you'll be hard pressed to find a more unlikable kid than Tyler To give some credit to the writer/director he does manage the hit the horror high notes and suspense the further the story progresses and did find myself slightly surprised as to how well done some of these elements were done . I shouldn't really be surprised because with SIGNS the director did show he could give an audience sleepless nights with simple scare tactics . The downside still remains in that the same director was being touted as ""The New Spielberg"" with THE SIXTH SENSE less than 20 years ago so making a fairly average film considered to be better than much of his recent output is the epitome of a backhanded compliment",The Visit
14,preppy-3,Starts off slow but leads to a great ending,7,26 March 2016,Two young kids go to spend a weekend with their grandparents at the big house in the middle of nowhere. They've never seen or talked to them before due to a falling out their mother had with them ages ago. As soon as they arrive there the grandparents (especially the grandmother) start acting very strange. Things slowly escalate until their last night there when things get completely out of control.It starts off slow and a little dull which is not a good thing. You start to wonder why the kids don't get out of there the instant their grandparents start acting strange. There's a few good jump scares though. However all of this is forgiven during the last half hour which gets violent and more than a little scary. Also good acting helps a lot by a cast of relative unknowns. It also has a twist that I didn't see coming. So just be patient with the slow beginning because the payoff at the end is worth it.,The Visit
15,LeonLouisRicci,Found Footage and Vomit and PoopOh My!,4,4 February 2016,"How's this for Originality and Creativity. Found Footage, Vomit, and Poop, and just to leave no Tired Trope Undone, Jump Scares. Needing a Very Low- Budget, Fearing Failure once Again. The Director Sinks to the FF Genre because it is Cheap. Really, Really Cheap.What is a Workhorse for the New and Untested Filmmakers of the World, the Oscar Winner is now playing among the Kids and the Poo-Poo Crowd. While His Experience behind the Camera can be seen now and then as some of the Shots are Slick, it only Distracts from the format drawing attention that says...""This is not really found footage."" So what's the Point?It's a Mess of a Movie. A Little Creepy if only because Old People can be Creepy, and only Scary when Things Jump onto the Screen with a Loud Noise. It's a Mishandled Movie. There are Scenes and Shots that could Never have Originated from the Source that it implies, Distracting, once again a Belief in the Conceit of the Thing.The Acting is OK and not Embarrassing or Cringe Inducing, but there are Things throughout that are. The Twist is so Thrown Away as to be hardly much of a Twist and the PG-13 makes the ending Violence Contrived and Hidden by Things in the Foreground, for Example.Overall, Not the Worst Movie the Director has done, but He has made a lot of Bad Ones so that isn't High Praise. Recommended for Horror Completists only and those that Love Their Found Footage (the numbers are dropping exponentially and you would think the Director would know that). Others will most Likely find this Average at Best and another in a long Descent for a Director that Once seemed to have something.",The Visit
16,zardoz-13,Neither Frightening Nor Fascinating,1,14 October 2015,"Humans do incredibly asinine things in horror movies. First, there are the unreasonable psychos. Think of Norman Bates in ""Psycho,"" Michael Myers in ""Halloween,"" Jason Voorhees in ""Friday the 13th,"" Victor Crowley in ""Hatchet,"" Jigsaw in ""Saw,"" Pinhead in ""Hellraiser,"" the Creeper in ""Jeepers Creepers,"" Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and Leatherface in ""The Texas Chainsaw."" These psychos cover a broad gamut, and they're all warped beyond imagination. Some spectators refuse to watch horror movies because the psychos are too unrealistic. Second, there are the poor, unfortunate victims who stumble into the web of terror that these psychos have spun to trap them. A strong, memorable horror chiller requires a unique villain, a chain of spine-chilling predicaments, and compelling victims. Indeed, the unsavory psychos with their degenerate deeds often overshadow their hopelessly sympathetic victims. Nevertheless, the victims must rise to the challenge. Most horror movie aficionados crave a genuinely creepy psycho villain, and a good horror movie franchise can thrive ad infinitum on such a character either human or inhuman as the aforementioned examples attest. Of course, it all boils down which one you tolerate the least. Bland psychos and stupid victims can undermine a horror movie, and ""Sixth Sense"" director M. Night Shyamalan's proves this point with ""The Visit,"" an execrable exercise in suspense. The children in this 'found footage' horror chiller are tangled up in a web of depravity and deception that might be scary if it weren't for their own colossal ignorance as well as that of their half-witted mom. Mind you, you cannot blame the victims strictly for making a bad horror movie. The writers and the director can be just as culpable. M. Night Shyamalan has created some of the most suspenseful, unforgettable, scary sagas with ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999), ""Unbreakable"" (2000), and ""Signs"" (2002), before his creativity unraveled with ""The Village"" (2004), ""The Happening"" (2008), ""The Last Airbender"" (2010), and ""After Earth"" (2013). Many abhorred ""Lady in the Water"" (2006), but I thought it was a clever and captivating fantasy comedy. As dreadful as ""After Earth"" was, the Will Smith debacle surpassed the wholly underwhelming ""Visit.""""The Visit"" unfolds from the perspective of two children, 15-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge of ""The Sisterhood of the Night"") and her 12-year old brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould of ""Paper Planes""), who spend a week with their maternal grandparents in the sticks so their divorced, irresponsible, single mom, Loretta (Kathryn Hahn of ""We're The Millers""), can take a Caribbean cruise with her boyfriend. Becca aspires to be a filmmaker and sets her sights on lensing a documentary about their experience at grandma's house. In part, Becca is producing this documentary to help her mom recover from her estranged relationship with her parents. Essentially, mom hasn't uttered a word to her folks in fifteen years. She eloped with her substitute teacher boyfriend when she was nineteen without her parents' approval. Ironically, Loretta's parents were right; the guy was a loser, but the marriage yielded Becca and Tyler. Although M. Night Shyamalan has appropriated the surefire formula of the 'found footage' film, ""The Visit"" isn't a movie where the footage turns up after the pandemonium. Becca and her younger brother rely on cameras throughout their visit to capture their mommy's parents. What they encounter in the middle of remote Pennsylvania is far from anything they could have imagined. First, their grandfather Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie of ""Lincoln"") establishes ground rules. The siblings must be in bed no later than 9:30 p.m. Second, they cannot venture into the padlocked basement. Nana (Deanna Dunagan of ""Mariachi Gringo"") behaves normally during the day and spends most of her time in the kitchen baking. After the sun sets, however, she cavorts about the premises, often naked, periodically puking on the floors when she isn't scratching at the walls like a cat sharpening its claws. Pop Pop confides in the kids that Nana is afflicted with dementia. Pop Pop is no role model himself. He chops wood endlessly and cleans a rifle. Tyler stalks Pop Pop and spots him going to a woodshed. Curious Tyler decides to inspect the woodshed, and he gets the surprise of his life. When Tyler isn't making up rap lyrics, he approaches everything with caution because he suffers from germophobia. You can imagine his horror when he discovers Pop Pop is plagued by incontinence, wears adult diapers, and stockpiles these soiled undies in the woodshed. Smack in the middle of what is supposed to be a scary movie we are treated to a pile of poop and prompted to cackle at Tyler's terror. Indeed, this constitutes bowel humor, and it is funny because Tyler screams the S-word. Later, Shyamalan replays this moment at the expense of our tyke-sized hero. Consequently, Pop Pop and Nana pose little threat to either child. Eventually, Nana asks unsuspecting Becca to crawl into their huge oven to clean it. Presumably, Becca has neither heard about nor read Grimm's classic fairy tale about Hansel and Gretel. Not only are our victims stupid but also they are culturally illiterate. If once were not enough, Nana persuades Becca to climb into the oven again while Tyler watches them! Anybody who has seen any M. Night Shyamalan movies should know by now about his affection for pulling unexpected twists in the tradition of American short story writer O'Henry. The twist in ""The Visit"" is so egregiously awful that you will want to get up and storm out of the theater. Initially, when I saw this claptrap, I got up and left because it was so incredibly idiotic. Of course, since I wanted to write a movie review, I went back to watch every minute of ""The Visit.""Like the Mark Wahlberg thriller ""The Happening,"" ""The Visit"" flounders for lack of anything either frightening or fascinating. The homicidal grandparents aren't sufficiently unnerving, and Shyamalan fails to generate an atmosphere laden with terror. Contrived above all else, ""The Visit"" qualifies as homegrown hokum.",The Visit
17,oscaralbert,Another horror classic from Universal . . .,8,15 September 2015,". . . THE VISIT makes THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE look like a friendly game of Twister, by way of comparison. Landmark disturbing films feature things that the audience knows instantly they can never Unsee. Linda Blair's hide-the-crucifix trick in THE EXORCIST or the cake knife girl in the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD are two examples. Diaperstein is a leading candidate for this distinction from THE VISIT. Old folks are the Number One Fear for people born in this century. Geezers' Social Security and Medicare costs will suck up half of everyone else's assets in a few years, and oldsters' adult diapers will fill ALL remaining landfill space in America even sooner.

18,neil-476,Better than feared,7,18 September 2015,"The precocious 15-year old Becca and her younger brother Tyler go to spend a week with their grandparents Nana and Pop Pop in wintry rural Pennsylvania to allow their mother to go on holiday with their boyfriend. The children have never met their grandparents: their mother remains estranged from them since she walked out as a teenager for undisclosed reasons. Would-be documentary maker Becca films everything, hoping to find a way to heal the estrangement. However, Nana and Pop Pop don't always behave exactly as expected.M Night Shyamalan writes and directs and, after his career in the director's chair – an almost straight line from the high point of The Sixth Sense to the low points of The Last Airbender and After Earth – one hopes for the best and expects the worst, and that is almost exactly what we get here. The good news is that this film is a considerable improvement on Shyamalan's last two or three outings. The bad news is that this is yet another subjective filming movie (the footage isn't ""found"" as such, so ""found footage"" is a misnomer in this case), and it is made as if Shyamalan has never seen one of these. It is slow.It's not too bad, though. The four main performances are all good, there is a nice build-up of uneasiness as the kids gradually realise that there is something profoundly weird going on, the reveal doesn't cheat the audience, and the resolution is pleasing. Two elements I didn't like were what happened as regards Tyler's germ phobia – I thought the ""in your face"" payoff wasn't sufficient to justify what was otherwise a dead end – and Tyler's rapping, which was just plain annoying. Twice.But overall, Shyamalan drags himself up a touch with this one.",The Visit
19,morrison-dylan-fan,Visiting hours.,7,21 October 2021,"Impressed by what he did to find tension in a film taking place in one location for 90% of the runtime with Old (2021) I've been curious about seeing more works from auteur film maker M. Night Shyamalan. Aware of this title being credited as his return to Horror, I decided to go for a visit.View on the film:Ending a run of big budgets with what was the title with the lowest budget of his career,and beginning a collaboration with producer Jason Blum, writer/directing auteur M. Night Shyamalan & Velvet Goldmine (1998-also reviewed) cinematographer Maryse Alberti hand Becca and Tyler video-cameras over to record a Found Footage week with their grandparents, a format that gets wonderfully broken.Shyamalan and Albert visit with stylish dissolves, wide-shots eavesdropping on Tyler and Becca watching their footage,and Shyamalan continuing build on his motif of long lingering dread, in tight narrow-shots of something crawling behind Becca.Whilst in the past being ambiguous over how intended the Comedy in his movies was, Shyamalan reveals a mischievous side in tasty overripe comedic set-pieces, from a odd game of Yahtzee, to Tyler getting a face-full of a dirty adult nappy.Walking a fine line of Becca and Tyler (played by an enthusiastic Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould, who reunited for the excellent Slasher Better Watch Out (2016-also reviewed)) having a horrifying and hilarious visit, the screenplay by Shyamalan unravels the reasoning the duo make that their grandparents are acting strange due to old age, (a subject he'd expand on exploring in Old (2021-also reviewed)) with a wickedly macabre twist which threads a chilling fearful atmosphere, when Tyler and Becca attempt to end the visit.",The Visit
20,anaconda-40658,Shyamalan Visits a Creepier Side.,9,23 September 2015,"The Visit (2015): Dir: M. Night Shyamalan / Cast: Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie, Kathryn Hahn: Creepy thriller about presumed innocence. Kathryn Hahn plays Paula Jamison, a divorcée who is off on a cruise with her latest beau. Her two children, Rebecca and Tyler are played by Olivia DeJorge and Ed Oxenbould. They give this film its found footage presentation as they film everything. They are being sent off to their estrange grandparents whom their mother conceals resentment towards. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie play Doris and John Jamison and they seem friendly enough until they issue a 9:30pm curfew. This results in strange occurrences of Doris scratching about in the horrid nude and John concealing his feces and shotgun in the outhouse. M. Night Shyamalan's career began with such promise until hitting several career embarrassments. Here he tones down the budget and allows for ominous atmosphere. What works against it is its inability to decide whether it is scary or amusing. It is includes a scene involving an adult diaper that is beyond cruel. DeJonge as Rebecca struggles with resentment towards her absent father. Oxenbould as Tyler is upbeat and expresses himself through rap and hip-hop. Dunagan and McRobbie are the right kind of strange and whacked as this old couple who are not what they seem. Hahn as Paula is briefer but much of her is played out through dialogue. This is a weird thriller about the not so innocence of the seemingly so as it stresses the void left when parents are absent. Speaking of which, it is great to see Shyamalan visit his roots again.

The story about kids going to stay with their estranged grand parents could have been pretty frightening. The isolated farm in PA is atmospheric.Unfortunately there are some faults that stop this from being a good horror movie. The camera work actually detracts from the scares. I know it was deliberate to show a film project but in the end, the hand held thing and unfocused and badly framed shots dilute the thrills and scares.The story has some plot holes that leave one irritated. The kids could have run and overpowered the old folks but they didn't. Why the boy was just standing in the kitchen and not running is strange. The twist if you can call it that is obvious from pretty early on and there is nothing much to top it after that.The actors are quite good. Deanna Dunagan makes an effective older scream queen.

22,zetes,Pretty good,7,2 February 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan goes back to the very basics in this pretty good little horror flick. It is found footage, and bears the same flaws as all of those movies (at a certain point, you know, just put down the damn camera), but, for the most part, it works. Two teenagers (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) visit their mother's long-estranged parents for a week long visit. The grandparents (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are very strange people, especially at night, when Grandma (ftr, I refuse to ever use designations like ""Nana"" and ""Pop Pop"" in any context, even if that's what the kids in the movie call them) is prone to denuding, crawling around on all fours, and wielding knives. Grandpa just throws his dirty diapers in the shed and occasionally puts a shotgun in his mouth. ""I'm just cleaning it!"" he shouts nervously as DeJonge catches him. Kathryn Hahn also co-stars as the mother, who talks with her kids on Skype throughout the film. The two kids are decent actors (though I could really do without Oxenbould's rapping) and the two older actors are delightfully unhinged. The tension builds nicely and there are a couple of good scares. The humor mostly works, though the dramatic arcs of the children don't come off perfectly.

23,mm-39,Disappointment!,5,22 September 2015,"Disappointment! The Visit breaks down into two concepts: what worked and what did not. What did not work: Another Blair Witch documentary style horror film! Shaky camera amateurish look with over long narration just like all the fake documentary genre horror films. The Visit comes across as self-absorbed and amateurish which annoys the viewer, and gets old fast. A granddaughter wants to meet her estranged grandparents which creates a stretched out boring personal narration, which adds little to the story line. The estranged grandparents exhibit clinical behaviors of paranoid schizophrenia and dementia, which becomes hard to watch. What worked: The plot twist where the mom lets the kids know via skype ""that's not my parents"". The end is tension filled of how will the children escape. The protagonist finds out the grandparents were murdered, and that the grandparents volunteered at the institute was not a great idea. Strong conclusions for a painful to watch story. Shyamalan (writer/director) has great concepts, plot twists, but regrettably Shyamalan's movies become bogged down in deep details which do not translate from word to film well. 5 out of 10.",The Visit

I know by now that you will always have the eternal unsatisfied. People that think they can do everything better then everybody. They are just losers to me, much blablabla about nothing really. So I gave The Visit a shot and of course I liked it. It might not be a scary horror movie nor a slasher with a lot of blood but it for sure kept me entertained until the end. A nice thriller to watch on a rainy evening. The story was good even though I figured it out in the middle of the movie but that doesn't matter it was still good. Normally I don't really like most of the kids acting but to me the best actor in The Visit was the youngest one. I thought Ed Oxenbould was very believable in his role.

25,StevePulaski,"A return to form, a revitalization of a genre, and so much more",9,12 September 2015,"There are many things surprising and unique about M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Visit,"" but probably the most surprising thing of all is the genuine optimism from the general public and film community for this film to be good. Leading up to the film's premiere, I saw hopes, pleas, and cries for this film to be good, contrary to hopes that a film tanks or winds up being a total failure, which seems to be the norm from cinephiles nowadays about any film. Given Shyamalan's track record has been fairly pitiful of late, with his most recent films ""The Happening,"" ""The Last Airbender,"" and ""After Earth"" being massive critical failures after claims he was the next Steven Spielberg following breakout films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" this positive, cheerful sentiment, to me, is unbelievable. The things he was once commended for - twists, inventive setups, and compelling buildups - became subjects of parody when discussing Shyamalan with his recent tread into lackluster film territory, but ""The Visit"" rekindles the spark that was lost in Shyamalan's films for so many years.The film revolves around Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), two young kids who are preparing for a week-long stay with their grandparents, John (Peter McRobbie) and Doris (Deanna Dunagan), when their mother Paula (Kathryn Hanh) and her current boyfriend go on a resort cruise. Rebecca and Tyler have never met their grandparents, due to their mother not speaking to them following the marriage and subsequent divorce from their father, so this vacation will be completely out of the blue for both of them. As a result, Rebecca, who loves film, decides to turn the experience into a documentary, featuring her and her brother meeting their grandparents for the first time and getting to the bottom of their mother's long-lost contact with the two.Upon arrival, John and Doris seem a little out of it. At first, Rebecca and Tyler just recognize the couple as being elderly. The only rule the grandparents enact for their grandchildren is that they cannot leave their room past 9:30pm. One night, however, Rebecca leaves her room to get a snack and sees both of her grandparents acting strangely, talking to themselves, vomiting, and engaging in what looks to be demented sleepwalking. Both her and Tyler are determined to find out what exactly is wrong with their grandparents, all while trying to piece together the strained relationship between them and their only daughter.In efforts to predicate ""The Visit"" off of what made his breakout beyond your average thriller director, Shyamalan also winds up breeding much-needed life into the found-footage genre. Through his characters, Shyamalan exposes the inherent inanity and frustration bestowed upon others when one person decides to go around and film everything they're doing. Rebecca's precocious ""cinephile"" tactics become used as dictation methods for her Tyler, who hilariously states, ""nobody gives a crap about cinematic standards"" when she's discussing the bar she's setting for her documentary. This nuanced manner of self-parody allows for ""The Visit"" to function on the plane of a found footage film whilst being a bit playful with the style.It's also amazing to note how funny ""The Visit"" can be, particularly thanks to Ex Oxenbould, who, after this and ""Alexander and The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day,"" is becoming quite the child actor, thanks to his unique appearance and decidedly natural presence. Oxenbould delivers some of the funniest lines in the film, as he plays the antsy little brother who is an aspiring rap artist, spitting bars whenever he gets the opportunity. The prevalent humor also helps emphasize the terrifically managed duality of having uproariously funny humor and well-paced, frightening suspense both exist in the film. Miraculously, one doesn't triumph over another, nor does one become the more dominant element, and ""The Visit"" remains consistently funny and scary, something I never saw coming.I realize this is less a review and more the ramblings of an awestruck viewer, but ""The Visit"" is one of the most peculiar mainstream films to be released in sometime and I have no doubt it will have that effect on some people. Shyamalan makes conventionality scary here, with the old house, decorated with wallpaper, hardwood floors, and antiques, captured through beautiful, rural cinematography by cinematographer Maryse Alberti. This is the essential element of ""The Visit,"" I feel and that's the fact that Shyamalan doesn't do much groundbreaking here. Merging comedy and horror is something that has been common since the spoof films of the 1980's, the woodsy environment and singular house in the middle of nowhere is an exploited cliché, and two youths trapped at the mercy of their surroundings is another commonality in many horror films. It's the personal expertise which Shyamalan verifies in this film, reassuring audiences who have fallen off from him in recent years that he can still concoct a rich, involving story and shock on numerous levels. The film has the surmounting dread and strong scares of a good mystery in addition to humor greater than most comedies this year. ""The Visit"" already, even with its considerable praise and strong pre-release reaction, is looking at being an underrated delight from Shyamalan.",The Visit

29,Hellmant,I think it's one of Shyamalan's weakest movies.,7,17 September 2015,"'THE VISIT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A found footage horror/comedy flick, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It's his third film, in a row, to follow kids as the main protagonists (following the poorly received 'THE LAST AIRBENDER' and 'AFTER EARTH'). The story revolves around two kids meeting their grandparents for the first time, and filming a documentary on it, when things go horribly wrong. The movie stars Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn. It was made on a budget of just $5 million; and it's been a decent critical, and financial, hit so far. I think it's one of Shyamalan's weakest movies.Becca (DeJonge) and Tyler (Oxenbould) are being sent, by their single mother (Hahn), to meet their grandparents (Dunagan and McRobbie) for the first time. Their mom had a falling out with her parents, fifteen-years earlier, and Becca wants to learn why. So she decides to make a documentary, on their experiences, during the 'visit'. It becomes obvious, very quickly, that something is seriously wrong, and terrifying, about their grandparents.The movie has a few good scares, and a somewhat surprising twist, but neither of these things are nearly as impressive as Shyamalan's earlier work. The film is also not nearly as emotional, as his earlier films, even though it tries to be (in places). It's funny, but not nearly as humorous as Shyamalan obviously thinks it is, and the two lead kid actors aren't very good. With the exception of 'THE SIXTH SENSE', Shyamalan doesn't seem to get very good performances, from any of the young actors in his movies; whether it's because of his directing, or their acting abilities, is not entirely clear. I wasn't nearly as impressed with this film, as a lot of the critics, and I don't think it's as good as even his last two movies (that's just my opinion though).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/5_iFqdaycDM",The Visit
30,thesar-2,"Visiting Hours Have Been Over for Years, M. Night",2,4 October 2015,"I'm guess this was supposed to be a horror-comedy. It's easy (and truthful) to say it failed miserably on both counts, but I will give it this: I did laugh out loud at all the unintentional moments, like all of M. Night films.Speaking of the egomaniac director, he is as consistently bad at making films as Adam Sandler is at making us cringe over and over again. Here, he actually takes a tiny bit of a decent idea and drowns it horribly in the unoriginal and failing found footage idiocy. Not that the movie would be okay without the thoughtless ""technique,"" but I would've at least thought it might have been a tad bit scary and original.The movie is so horribly unfunny when it thinks it's hilarious, boring when it thinks it's horrifying and actually rips off Paranormal Activity but, unbelievably makes it even less interesting. And sadly, like most unintentionally hilarious M. Night movies, the super slow scenes meant for tension still never pay off. Further, it also rips off my favorite (for laughing at, that is) of all M. Night's films: The Happening. The Grandmother mopes around like the characters in his Plants Kill comedy. I couldn't help but laugh once again at what M. Night finds scary.Well, maybe I'll take back all I said above. If you do like unintentionally hilarious (""Yahtzee!"") movies like I do, you might like this. I laughed so hard in many scenes, but the climax alone, was worth the buildup. I'm guessing it was meant to be frightening, but it ended up giving me a belly ache from laughing so hard. (And I'm not just talking about the rapping moron. Though, that helped.)",The Visit
31,cherold,People don't appreciate this movie nearly enough,9,9 August 2016,"""You have to laugh to keep the deep darkies in a cave."" It's a line in the movie, but it's also a summary of the movie's approach, which expertly blends comedy, weirdness, and darkness into a lovely elixir.For over the first third, The Visit is a comedy about a couple of typically pretentious teenagers visiting their grandparents for the first time. The girl is a wannabe filmmaker, and the movie is made up of her documentary footage. While the found-footage gimmick is well worn by now, it's very well done here.I think the comic beginning is why some people say this movie starts slow; it starts slow if you want a horror movie. If you settle in for a comedy, it's wonderful.The Visit comes to a slow, calculated boil, moving from comedy to weirder comedy to weirdness and thrills with some comedy elements, and it's wondrous to see how beautifully M. Night Shyamalan melds the films disparate elements into a seamless whole. Along the way, there are pauses for moments of introspection and sadness, and the movie hits every point beautifully.As usual, Shyamalan has a twist. I figured out the main twist early on (it's fairly obvious, really), but that was fine, I still enjoyed the way it played out.I'm rather puzzled that, even though this movie has been declared a comeback of sorts for Shyamalan, it's just gotten okay reviews. For me it deserves far higher praise. The storytelling is economical, the acting is excellent, and the movie does a good job of peppering in the expository dialogue needed to explain what just happened in quick dashes that allow the film to end without the Psycho-style explanatory scene. (Although once you start going over it in your head you'll realize there are some big plot holes in here.) But then, I don't really agree that this is Shyamalan's comeback, because I haven't agreed with the popular notion that he started great and lost it. The only movie of his I've really hated was The Village, and overall I've found his films ranged from great (Sixth Sense, Signs) to reasonably watchable (The Happening, The Last Airbender) I'm even the rare viewer who liked The Lady in the Lake; perhaps I appreciate Shyamalan's sense of humor more than others. After watching The Visit, I've decided to check out the one of his movies I haven't seen, After Earth. Because for me, what the critics think about M. has proved virtually meaningless.Anyway, This is one of his best movies, along with Sixth Sense and Signs. Why can't people see that?",The Visit

33,Robert_duder,M. Night comes back swinging (twist will NOT be revealed here),8,20 September 2015,"Poor, poor M. Night Shyamalan! In his first feature film he gave movie goers the shock of a lifetime. He managed to throw an enormous twist at a tech savvy, internet early world and people kept it to themselves so everyone else could be shocked and now its pop culture history. But now, every time M. Night makes a film, people have expectations that are astronomical. The guy could never hope to attain the expectations people have. Now for me, as an M. Night fan, he has made some of the best movies I have ever seen even besides The Sixth Sense. Unbreakable, Signs and Lady In The Water were all brilliant as far as I'm concerned. But he has stumbled as well. The Happening is easily one of the worst movies I've ever laid eyes on. I actually feel sick when I think about watching that again. Devil was okay at best and After Earth...well we all know how everyone felt about that. So here comes The Visit. Well in my opinion, this is the M. Night Shyamalan that fans should expect. It is dark and creepy and has you asking so many questions. Its more typical ""horror"" than you'd expect from him and has its share of ""jump"" scares that are more effective than usual. I even jumped more than once and it takes a lot to catch me off guard. The acting is nearly brilliant and this very well could have been a 10 for me (like I would say The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs and Lady In The Water were for me) if not for the fact that it is done as a ""found footage"" film. This also proves how much I liked the story and performances in this film because I HATE found footage. It was good once or twice when it first was new but now its completely overdone, ridiculous and story ruining. I still stand by the fact that this would have been better without found footage HOWEVER Shyamalan does it better than most and avoids the usual ""always have a camera on"" pratfalls and plot holes.The two youngsters in the film are played by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould and they are fantastic. They both give A+ performances and I hope this does great things for both of them. As siblings they are near perfect and they both have very distinct personalities and back stories. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie don't get outplayed though because they are both fantastic too. Its such a small cast and all eyes are on the four of them and Dunagan and McRobbie play every aspect of their bizarre characters to perfection. The four of them have such great chemistry as a cast and they bring the film up a few notches for sure. Usually a comedienne Kathryn Hahn does a very good job in a small role as the kids' mom. And that's about it for the cast but that's all that's needed. You will be impressed because the casting for this is fantastic.There is one glaring plot hole to this story and after you've seen the movie and read some reviews you will likely read it and realize that they're right. So you have to suspect belief for this one aspect. It is technically explainable no matter how implausible and it doesn't ruin the movie for me by any means. It might be like The Sixth Sense where the first time is exponentially better than the other times. The film is creepy enough to completely entertain you, the twist is exciting enough to make you not think about plausibility at first and best of all I happen to think that this is at least a start to M. Night Shyamalan's return to the top of his game. It is a genuinely freaky ""horror thriller"" and that is not easy to find nowadays. Definitely worth checking out although in Canada the film is Rated PG which is ludicrous because be warned it is scary, some nudity, a fair bit of bad language and definitely mature content. Enjoy! 8.5/10",The Visit
34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"M. Night Shyamalan's best movie since 'Unbreakable', this above-average thriller is interesting and unique but ultimately lacks both scares and even laughs.",6,5 July 2016,"'The Visit (2015)' is M. Night Shyamalan's best movie since 'Unbreakable (2000)', easily standing head-and-shoulders above the more recent cinematic garbage he's been making. That's not to say that it's great, though; in fact, it's pretty far from it. However, it is an above average thriller that unfortunately lacks both scares and, even, laughs.Basically, two kids go to meet their estranged grandparents for the first time but not all is as it appears; when the grandparents start to act very strangely, the children begin to uncover a fairly creepy mystery. One of the film's major issues is that it doesn't feel entirely consistent, with its attention constantly being pulled between horror and comedy. As such, neither element really worked for me. That's not to say that the two genres can't be successfully combined; they have been many times. It's just that this piece doesn't find the right balance between its so-called scares and its lacklustre laughs. Still, it's interesting and does have a few tense - if strange - scenes.There are several other positive aspects, too. Firstly, the movie does a good job justifying and maintaining its 'found footage' style. It actually works in this case and I doesn't come across as annoying, unrealistic or obnoxious. It's surprising how well it was handled and, while you're always aware of the style, it never takes you out of the story. I think that it's a clever choice to have the lead girl be consciously making a documentary, as it allows the picture to actually feel like a film that she has made herself (aside from a few jarring and out of place opening titles). It also explains why she wants to film everything, and Shyamalan manages to frame some interesting shots under the guise of her directing knowledge. Every shot feels as though it is being filmed by one of the two leads, and the lighting looks organic too. You never feel as though she should just put the camera down, aside from during a couple of shots that pan away unnecessarily just to provide a subsequent jump-scare.Another positive thing about the movie is its cast. Every member is convincing and puts all of their effort in; they feel natural, like real people. The two child actors are especially impressive, keeping up with the more experienced adults and turning in great performances of their own. They make for likable protagonists, even though the brother character is sometimes (intentionally, I think) annoying. The writing is also reasonably good, with the dialogue creating rounded characters with palpable histories and personality traits. The whole film is pretty unique as well, by which I mean it is absolutely crazy. It's incredibly weird, with some of its events seeming to come out of nowhere, and it isn't all that consistent, either. There's also not a lot of explanation, though this may actually help; you get a clear idea of the most important events, even though the motivations and back-story remain quite muddy. I like how weird it is, as Shyamalan has clearly made the film without any real studio interference. It's fairly simple by his standards, and that allows the bizarre nature of it to entertain rather than confuse.The problems mainly start to arise with the conflict in tone. I appreciate that it isn't a run-of-the-mill studio flick, and also that it isn't confined by its genre(s). I do feel, however, that it may have benefited from narrowing its scope a little in terms of tonality. It should perhaps have focused upon being a great horror or a great comedy, instead of trying to be both. Ultimately, it ends up a little underwhelming in both categories, and it isn't really funny or scary. The strange aspects of the film are impeded by this, too, as most of what happens is so odd that you aren't sure whether to be frightened or amused. Instead, you end up doing neither and simply try to work out what you just saw. Some of it is just out of place, as several overtly comedic elements pierce through the more suspenseful segments. The film never tells you to laugh, and actually plays itself pretty straight, which simply serves to enhance the confusing tone. I feel as though the eerie atmosphere would have worked much better if it wasn't perforated by off-the-wall and strange humour. Although it isn't scary or amusing, it's interesting and that's several successful suspense sequences.There are a few other issues as well, such as some contrivances and a more clichéd final act. There are some times where the 'found-footage' elements become more generic, though thankfully those are few and far between. The brother character, while well acted, can be very annoying - especially when he raps. I guess it is a nice character trait, but it is honestly quite cringe-inducing and feels like a forced attempt at comedy. That character also uses a few instances of modern slang and strangely uses the names of female pop-stars instead of curse words, elements which feel like overt and shoe-horned attempts at being modern or relevant. On top of this, a couple of characters make some questionable decisions and there are some inconsistencies with motivations. Some scenes also don't necessarily make sense when viewed as part of a whole, especially after the climactic revelations.Overall, 'The Visit' is a solid thriller that doesn't try to be anything it isn't; it's intriguing and unique, with its 'found-footage' style being handled very well. Though not particularly scary and not at all funny (to me, at least), it's fairly engaging and is clearly M. Night Shyamalan's best film since 'Unbroken (2000)': 6/10.",The Visit
35,bowmanblue,Visitation rights revoked,4,5 June 2017,"I'll pretty much watch any old horror film. It's a definite fault in mine. So I sat down to watch 'The Visit' based on the fact that it was new and looked a bit spooky, judging by the front cover (yes, I do know the old saying about never judging a book by its cover, but I still do!). Now, apart from knowing that it was a horror movie, I learned two other majorly important facts in the opening couple of scenes. The first of which that it was partly made by M Night Shyamalan and, if you don't know, made those classic films 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' around the year 2000. And, since then, his film-making record has been a little patchy (to put it politely!). Secondly, this is a 'found footage' film. And, if you don't know what that is then you obviously don't watch enough modern horror.'The Visit' is about a couple of kids who go to meet their grandparents for the first time (you'll soon find out why they've only just discovered their relatives during their early teenage years, but, ultimately, exposition doesn't matter much). And this is where the 'found footage' element comes in, for the teenage girl feels the need to document the whole experience on her camera, hence the following ninety minutes are relayed entirely through the – shaky – camera-work of a teenage girl. Again, there's a minimal explanation as to why she should feel the need to do this, but, rest assured, as annoying as this would be in real life, no one in the film seems bothered about being filmed a hundred per cent of the time. So, they meet their grandparents and strange things start to happen.Sadly, strange (or rather/interesting/horrific) things don't happen quick enough. If ever a film seemed to drag out its first half then it was here. Yes, I know that it's a little cheap to jump right into a massive bloodbath in the opening scene and a slow burner like this is supposed to build tension and get to know the characters. Yet, the two kids are just not that interesting and you can see the 'threat' coming a mile off. By the time anything remotely interesting happens the film is practically over and you've been checking out Facebook on your smartphone a dozen times while this film has been slowly cranking itself up.Ultimately, it's just yet another run-of-the-mill horror films which clutter up the pool of a thousand other recent found footage films out there. Once again, M. Night Shyamalan does nothing to recapture his former greatness and, although I believe he still has another decent movie or two in him somewhere, this goes no way to prove that. Avoid. You'll have seen better and, if you haven't – again – you obviously don't watch enough horror.",The Visit
36,ThomasDrufke,"Goodnight, Grandma",6,23 September 2015,"I'm not sure why I went out and saw this film. After all, I haven't seen any of Shyamalan's other films. Not because I don't want to, I do. But I have been spoiled with several of his twist endings that I was very hesitant to rush to watch any of them. As for The Visit, I wasn't spoiled of anything. Even if I was, I think the film still would have been somewhat entertaining. It's rather simple in its premise. A few kids who have never met their grandparents decide to spend a week out in a reclusive house with them in order to get to know them and to find out more about why their mom abandoned the parents in the first place.The shaky/found footage style of film actually works to this films benefit, much like Chronicle. The kids are out to make a documentary film based on their experience, so that solves that problem. But the filming never becomes distracting or takes away from the actual story. The kids also give surprising formidable performances along with the oh so creepy grandparents. Which is why this film works. Without the performances, the film would just be another low budget horror cash grab. But I think to a certain extent, you care about these characters enough to invest yourself for an hour and a half. Where I think the film fails is that its really not all that scary. It uses the jump scares maybe a tad too much and its just a lot more disturbing than anything. I don't think I ever legitimately feared for the characters. I also found the whole rap gag with the younger brother to be rather silly. I don't think the balance of the comedy-horror worked to its benefit. The film isn't bad, its much better than I expected. There's some entertainment to be had, but not a ton. I just think the film relied on the gross out disturbing elements to try and freak people out rather than doing it more naturally.+Performances+Better than it has a right to be+Creepy at times-Disturbing elements were distracting-Wasn't that scary6.0/10",The Visit
37,MLDinTN,twist too easy to guess,5,26 June 2016,"I'm terrible at guessing the twist in movies, but this one I got right on because it was so obvious. When the grandparents start saying and doing all this crazy stuff, well the conclusion is they are crazy.The plot is 2 kids go to stay a week with grandparents they have never met. First, what mother puts her kids on a train to visit people they don't know. That pushes believability. Any ways the kids constantly say the weird things going on are because they are old. Well when the grandmother creeps around like a possessed person and laughs at nothing and asks the girl to get in the oven, that should have been a clue, something is way off.Plus at the end, when the mom tells the kids those aren't their grandparents, how could it possible take so long to get the police there and she is with them and supposedly lived far away. Surely that county of PA had someone that could have gotten out there earlier.FINAL VERDICT: the twist wasn't shocking,easy to guess. I'd only recommend it if you don't mind a dull shocker.",The Visit

As soon as the kids show up they get an uneasy feeling. The grandparents are acting very strange but the kids chalk it up to old age, but things aren't always as they seem. This is a hard movie to review. The movie is entertaining and worth watching, but the problem is is that I'm not sure what it wanted to be. It passes itself off as a horror movie, but me and my kids laughed almost the whole way through. Some of the time it was intentionally funny, other times not so much so. The best thing I can say about this is that the ""found footage"" style used actually works well in this one and isn't just a gimmick like in most movies like this. Shyamalan has come a long way since the Sixth Sense and this movie doesn't really do anything to restore his luster. My kids loved it, but because they laughed so much, I'm not sure that was the goal of this movie. Overall, tried so hard to be scary but came off as a very funny comedy.

It has bad acting by all involved (except maybe for the girl), uninvolving writing, lazy and directing by a director who i can safely say was once my favorite - that was SO long time ago. This is a found footage type of the movie, but sadly it's not a horror, nor it's a comedy, nor drama. It tries to mix these 3 genres, and it has some glimpses, but fells short very soon.Overall, skip this movie, this is sadly not a return to greatness of once iconic director, this is lazy movie by all accounts, with no purpose, it has nothing to say and nothing good or interesting to show.",The Visit
42,ironhorse_iv,The Visit is kinda worth visiting. It was an alright movie for the most part.,6,27 October 2015,"While, the movie isn't really that funny, or scary. This horror movie written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan was surprising, not that bad. It had the right amount of horror and comedy to make it, somewhat entertaining. The Visit proves once again, that this where Shyamalan belongs. After all, these are the genres that M. Night Shyamalan is known best for. It also helps that the movie was marketed as a small-budget independent film, rather than a huge money blockbuster. This allows, Shyamalan to work harder on the story asset, rather than focusing his time, on over-the-top visual effects. Unlike Shyamalan's recent films, there is an emotional depth to The Visit that is worth seeing, alone. The movie tells the story of contemporary grief/loss and how not to hold on to anger to your loves ones, because you don't know if you'll ever get a chance to forgive/reconcile with them. It's a very strong message that anybody can related to. I really did get invested in the story of a family is trying to recovered, from a recent divorce. Hoping to give their mother, Paula Jamison (Kathryn Hahn) a well-needed vacation with her new boyfriend; two young kids, Thirteen-year-old Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and 15-year-old Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) agree to spend a week with their grandparents, even though, they never met them. At first, their ""Nana"" (Deanna Dunagan) and ""Pop Pop"" (Peter McRobbie), seem fine, but things started to unravel, when night falls. Can the kids survive their week with them, or will something deadly happen? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie is clearly not a 'found-footage' movie, like some critics label it. It doesn't have, that raw factor that many found-footage movie, has. First off, the camera visual style isn't that amateurism. There wasn't a lot of blurry shots, shaking cam, or pitch darkness shots. Thank God! I like that the movie was mostly well-shot. Shyamalan uses the style with more creativity than most other filmmakers, displaying his unique visual motif. Some great examples are his use of reflected images for dramatic and thematic effect. Others are his use of intimacy long-takes and how he creates a Mise en scène. Plus, the movie, zig-zagged, heavily, from traditionally In-Universe storytelling camera shots to hand-held. It's felt more Cinéma vérité, with bits of documentary style. It's really hard to bypass this as 'realistic found-footage' movie, when there are credits & day title cards, being shown, throughout the film. It's a bit jarring to see that. However, I get, why it's filmed on a hand-held camera. There is in universe reason for this. It was film, this way, because Rebecca is an aspiring, documentary filmmaker with a big heart. Rebecca wants to document the whole thing as a form of therapy for her mum, whose reasons for the bad blood with her parents remain a tightly-kept secret. The characters themselves are even aware of certain cinematic theories that could make their ""documentary"" more interesting. They're refreshingly intelligent and self-aware, and they never blunder stupidly into any situation. I also love the straight-to-camera confessions scenes. You really get to see, their desires and anxieties through it. Using this, Shyamalan was able to show, a large range of emotional, within his actors. In my opinion, most of the actors give great performances. The child actors were very likable. The grandparent are downright creepy. However, there were a few things that didn't work for me. I really didn't like how the film establish the kid's phobias. It wasn't use, right. I really don't get, how Becca is afraid of looking at herself on camera, but she's okay, at looking at herself, on Skype. Another thing, why Tyler is afraid of germs, yet, he's willing to play hide and seek, under the dirty stairs. It doesn't make sense. For the grandparents. I really didn't like Grandma's over the top, ""alien"" theory. Remind me, too much of his previous awful films, 2006's Lady and the Water, and 2002's Signs. Her jump scares and suicide attempts were also pretty lame. It seem, more silly than disturbing. I also didn't like, the poop or cleaning the gun jokes for the Grandpa. It really seem way too cartoony and fell really flat. Nevertheless, I still like their Yahtzee scene. By far, the best part of the film. Some of the grandfather's dialogue, is kinda choppy, and unrealistic in tone, too. The film has also been criticized for its use of dementia equals violent, approach, by other critics; but in my opinion, I just glad, it wasn't cause, by, anything supernatural. Overall: I came into this movie with very low expectations. After all, it's been a while, since director M. Night Shyamalan made an alright movie. While, this movie isn't bad, it wasn't really good. It was pretty mediocre. As much as people might hate him, in my opinion, Shyamalan is a filmmaker whom somewhat deserve a comeback. Hopefully, his next movie will be a masterpiece.

45,paulclaassen,I'm so over found footage...,4,15 December 2020,"Found footage in 2015 still?? They keep trying to find original ways to justify people running around filming everything. 'The Visit' is - in my opinion - a perfect example of a found footage film that is not believable.Ok, not the entire movie, but certainly for most part. The film is about kids visiting their grandparents for the first time, and they're filming everything ""for a documentary"". If I was a grandparent and a child I've never seen in my life were to film me every step of the way, I'd call child support right away! Its just not believable - not at all! Once they start suspecting something weird is going on, then yes, it makes sense for them to plant cameras around the house.The film became increasingly more sinister and creepy. Despite this, though, I already lost interest the moment the found footage couldn't be justified. And - to be honest - I actually found most of the story uninteresting and quite boring. There's very little explanation here. The twist ending did have the shock factor, but ultimately its not a film I'd watch again. It was ok for a first viewing. If you're into this sort of thing, rather watch 'Paranormal Activity' (the original). There's a myriad of haunted found footage films out there nowadays.

46,sol-,Visiting Hours,7,3 October 2016,"On holiday with their grandparents who they had never before met, two teenagers gradually grow uneasy with their grandparents' bizarre rituals and nocturnal behaviour in this blend of horror, mystery, comedy and thriller elements from M. Night Shyamalan. Shot mostly in a 'found footage' style on a noticeably low budget for the Oscar nominated director, 'The Visit' is a welcome breath of fresh air. The plot is far too heavily reliant on a 'shocking' twist that can be predicted very early on, however, Shyamalan establishes mood and atmosphere well with an inescapable sense of unease throughout. At the same time, the script includes fun filmmaking plugs since the siblings are making a documentary about their visit. The boy comments ""nobody gives a *beep* about cinematic standards"", citing the rise of reality TV as indicative of what the public want, while the girl humorously manipulates her footage, getting subjects to stand in uncomfortable positions and asking weird icebreaker questions. Shyamalan even manages to get some good laughs in as the interviewed subjects comment about previous acting experience (two of them begin reciting plays!). And yet, not all the humour works - the rapping in particular - and it is hard not to wonder whether a more dramatic approach may have been better. It is enticing stuff until the end though, and how many recent Shyamalan films can one say that for?",The Visit
47,zkonedog,Horror & Humor: An Odd Combination,5,1 March 2017,"""The Visit"" is easily one of the strangest movies I've ever watched. The reason? Think about this: When has a truly great horror movie ever made you laugh at the same time?For a basic plot summary, ""The Visit"" sees children Becca (Olivia DeJonge) & Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) visiting their grandparents, Nana (Deanna Dunagan) & Pop-Pop (Peter McRobbie) for a week, having no previous contact with them due to a dispute with the children's mother (Kathryn Hahn) long ago. When the siblings arrive on the old farmstead, however, they discover that Nana & Pop-Pop's behavior is erratic (at best) and downright terrifying (at worst).Clearly, ""The Visit"" advertises itself as a horror flick and that is the genre it most wants to identify with. However, when I think back on some of the best horror movies I can recall (Halloween, Saw, The Ring, etc.), one common denominator is that none of them contain any humor. That is where M. Night Shyamalan tries to shake things up...but with very mixed results. In between the scenes of the grandparents getting progressively stranger and stranger, the two kids are hamming it up the whole time and playing for laughs. To me, that really kept killing the tone of the film, as I never felt it sustained enough scary tension at prolonged intervals.Of course, being a Shyamalan production, it does contain a twist ending that will legitimately throw you for a loop. Just like in some of his previous films (like ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable""), a number of clues are in place for the perceptive viewer to maybe start piecing things together. Actually, though, where M. Night shines the most in this one is picking great child actors and getting wonderful performances out of them. There are times when their actions and situations can and will produce genuine laughter. Again, though, does that laughter have a place in a movie meant to be scary?Overall, ""The Visit"" is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. It goes for scares...but ends up delivering just as many (if not more) laughs. I saw it in a theater filled with young teens, and they seemed to love it. Perhaps that was the intended audience all along...the tone of the film just makes it so difficult to figure out. Those who like to invest a bit more thought or want to see a bit more sustained tension, however, will likely be disappointed.",The Visit

Over the course of his career, it has been well noted that his overall films have been criticized and not has great as his earlier films. The Visit is a more unknown and low budget found footage film and it is decent, although predictable. The film is quite short in running time which is enough for this time of genre. We understand and know there will be a twist in the end, and twist did elevate the film somewhat but could also have been done in a better and more revealing manner.

49,filipemanuelneto,"Average and forgettable, but capable of intimidating the public.",4,10 May 2020,"When I prepare to see a film directed or written by Night Shyamalan, I never know what I'm going to get. As I said in other reviews of his films, he has creativity but does not always get a positive result from his effort, going from genius to goofy at a glance and having brilliant films with a lot of mediocre efforts in between.In this film, two brothers go to visit their grandparents so that their mother can go on vacation. They have never seen their grandparents, or at least they have not been with them for years, and the elderly seem radiant and everything is going well... until grandma begins to reveal somewhat strange habits and everything starts to look tense. The script plays well with signs of senility and alzheimer's, which are common among the elderly, to create a tense environment that also spreads to the audience. However, other than that, the film has little story to tell and high doses of melodrama that clash a little with the global picture. The film contains a twist near the end as the director usually does. This turnaround is good and prepares the final climax, worthy of a horror movie... but this ending is too long, it would have had more impact if it were shorter and more sudden.The cast is headed by two young actors, Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould. Olivia stands out clearly and shows promising signs about her career. The grandparents, Peter McRobbie and Deanna Dunagan, were also very good, truly convincing in the way they brought their characters to life. Deana, in particular, deserves real praise. At the opposite end is Kathryn Hahn, totally artificial as mother. This character was very poorly thought and sounds false all the time.Technically, the film is poor, perhaps even the poorest of the Shyamalan work I have ever seen, with strict regard to production values and technical aspects. The idea of young people recording testimonials for a kind of homemade documentary sounds false and only works as a justification for a ""found footage"". The total amateurism of cinematography, which is almost always shaky, out of focus, without light or too bright, clashes with the number of professional cameras that children had at their disposal, always appearing in the shooting angle of each other. If the idea was for children to shoot an amateur film, how can the cameras be so many and so good? Did they have wealthy parents?Okay, I recognize that this film is not one of the worst in Shyamalan's career. But the fact is that it is also not a success or deserves to be seen more than once. With poor production values, a little-known but capable cast, a weak story, full of inconsistencies but that manages to intimidate the audience, is an average and forgettable film.",The Visit
50,leonblackwood,Just like many other movies in this genre! 3/10,3,28 May 2016,"Review: I'm not usually a big fan of movies in this genre but I thought that I would give this movie a chance, once I saw M. Night Shyamalan's name attached to it. Big Mistake! The first disappointing aspect about this film is that the director used the, played out method, of filming it through a camcorder. It also takes ages to get going and when the two young kids, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), finally work out that there ""so-called"" grandparents are nuts, the showdown is rushed and not that great. I know that the kids mother, Kathryn Hahn, wasn't talking to her mum, which is why she just sent her kids to there address but I still can't believe that she wouldn't interact with her parents to make sure that her young kids were OK. With that aside, I found the storyline pretty weak and I personally lost interest very early in the movie, due to the annoying narrating from the girl and the terrible rapping from the boy, which seemed pointless. Basically, this isn't the movie to put M. Night Shyamalan back on the map but I'm sure that people, who are fans of this genre, would have enjoyed it. Disappointing!Round-Up: Indian born, M. Night Shyamalan, 45, has built a reputation, which will always make his movies a box office smash but that does not mean that they are any good. His first two movies, Praying With Anger and Wide Awake, wasn't that great but when Sixth Sense was released in 1999, his career really did take off. He then had a string of hits with Unbreakable, Signs, the Village, Lady In The Water and the Happening but his latest movies, the Last Airbender, After Earth and this one, haven't been that great. He's obviously a director who takes his time to release his projects because he has only directed 12 movies in his career but he will always be remembered for his earlier projects which have made him a director who all the big stars want to work with. This movie just seemed like many others in this genre but it still made a hefty profit at the box office, mainly because of his established name.Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $99millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/thrillers starring Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagun, Peter McRobbie, Katryn Hahn and Celia Keenan-Bolger. 3/10",The Visit

Based on his recent track record, I was worried this proclamation may end up being the scariest part of the film. Luckily, the infamous filmmaker has taken a step back in the right direction with his most purely horror film to date. Sure, his propensity for hackneyed exposition and odd dialogue hasn't disappeared completely, but they are accompanied by some truly original horror images, shot with an immense skill for effectively terrifying timing. The Visit is a decent little creep-show that's a shocking return-to-form for Shyamalan. This success is largely thanks to its narrow scope: two teens must spend a week with their grandparents who are growing increasingly strange. We never really leave the home of the elderly couple, allowing the unique scares to be at the center. These thrills are effectively eye-covering, but what makes them fun is their ability and intention to cause laughter as quickly as screams. Some of that humor exudes straight from the jokes in the scares, but much of it is just an acknowledgment of having been tricked. The spookily exaggerated performances may be a turn-off for some, but they enhance the simultaneous feeling of dread and silliness that make this film work. That balance is where The Visit works best, but when it tries to reach deeper it falters. Luckily, Shyamalan rarely let's his ambitions get in the way of the scary good times. With some truly unforgettable moments and a heart-dropping reveal, this small-scale chiller reminds us why we fell in love with this guy.",The Visit

This movie will refresh your memory.When I first saw who the director of this found footage movie was I thought Shyamalan was on his last legs, but after seeing this movie it was like a boxing champ starting from the beginning in the poor old hood he came up from in order to train for his biggest fight yet. It's the best found footage movie I've seen since the original Paranormal Activity. It was about a group of kids spending a week in the house of their long lost grandparents. Shyamalan was able to sculpt a realistic situation of kids being freaked out by their strange older family members that was chuckle out funny and at the same time uncannily scary. It's has a Catfish feel to it, but in the hands of Shyamalan The Visit makes the ghost of Hitchcock totally envious and angry that this movie is not a part of his own filmography.This is the movie you want to see, 100% entertainment!!!!",The Visit

Are Becca and Tyler just imagining things, or is something not quite right with there grandparents? Shyamalan proves he can direct, even a low budget film, the found footage really works here, gives you a feel like it's really happening. The scenes in the house are effectively creepy, giving a haunted house like feel to it. Olivia DeJonge really gives an effective performance, so does Ed Oxenbould, who has an acting ability to defines his years. Deanna Dungan is quite watchable in her performance, so was Peter McRobbie.

There are some truly effective scare scenes, but there is also quite a lot of humour too, though to call this a horror/comedy maybe be going a little too far. Got to give it credit for featuring a rap song about having a dirty diaper on the face!
This movie grew on me, the characters are likeable enough, it has decent production values, etc. However, it is nowhere no as good as M.Night's classics",The Visit
55,stevendbeard,Good M. Night Twist,6,11 September 2015,"I saw ""The Visit"", starring Olivia DeJonge-Hiding_tv, The Sisterhood of Night; Ed Oxenbould-Alexander and the Terrible,Horrible,No Good,Very Bad Day, Puberty Blues_TV; Deanna Dunagan-Unforgettable_tv, Running Scared; Peter McRobbie-Law & Order_tv, Spider-Man 2 and Kathryn Hahn-Bad Words, Step Brothers.This is a movie written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who has done some good movies-The Village, Signs and The Sixth Sense-and a few clunkers-After Earth, The Last Airbender and Lady in the Water. Thankfully, this one aims more towards his good material. Kathryn is a single mother of two teens, Olivia & Ed. Kathryn left home when she was 19 years old-on bad terms with her parents-and her kids have never even seen their grandparents. After finally talking to her parents, Kathryn decides to send the kids to spend a week and get acquainted with Nana & Pop Pop, who live out in the country. Kathryn decides to take a vacation while the kids are gone and puts them on a train to be met by Deanna/Nana & Peter/Pop Pop. Everything is fine at first but then things get a little strange. Deanna & Peter start acting loony and warn the kids not to go down into the basement-'It's moldy down there!'-and tell them that their bedtime is 9:30pm-'It would be best if you don't leave the room after 9:30!' When the kids ask about some of the strange behavior of Peter & Deanna they are told that they are just 'sundowning', which is explained as an old folks disease that affects them when the sun goes down, sort of like sleep walking. The real reason for their behavior is the M. Night twist, and it is best if you don't know about it going in-but if you really want to know, let me know & I will spoil it for you. The only problem I had with the movie was the kids filmed everything, so most of the movie has that 'Blair Witch/Paranormal Activity' hand held camera feel to it. In the movie, Ed is also an aspiring young rapper that loves to rap on any subject given him and as the end credits start, he does a funny rap-there are no scenes at the very end. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and nudity and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes. I liked it enough to buy it on DVD.",The Visit
56,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The Visit,3,20 July 2019,3/10 - home-video-style camera angles take away from an already sub-par horror flick,The Visit
57,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,3,23 December 2017,"Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are brother and sister. Whilst Becca is putting together a film which fuels 'The Visit' (found footage style), Tyler raps. If you can get through these little bursts of 'talent' (each rap ends with '...ho') without punching yourself repeatedly then you may well find these two quite appealing. They spout dialogue beyond their years perhaps, but they exhibit little of the brattishness you may expect with two juvenile leads.The two siblings are visiting their grandparents (Deanna Dunagan) and (Peter McRobbie) and observe them displaying bizarre and disturbing behaviour. Occasionally, this seems to be educating us that 'old people are gross' and reinforcing stereotypes that once you're over 60, you're senile and incontinent. But luckily, most of their behaviour is clearly portrayed as abnormal in an effective 'horror-film' kind of way.There is, however, no real progression here. The grandparents behave oddly and the kids are scared. Then the grandparents behave normally and the kids come round to them. This repeats itself throughout, but because matters don't go any further than that, the audience are continually placed back on square one.Being an M. Night Shyamalan film, there is a twist. SPOILER - their grandparents are not their grandparents. They're escaped lunatics. That's right. We are supposed to believe neither Becca nor Tyler have never been shown a photograph of the two relatives they are to spend a week with.The idea of a progressively unstable elderly couple seen through the eyes of young children could have been terrifying. But, apart from a couple of stomach-churning moments, it doesn't quite make it. And why does it take the police so long to arrive?By the time the end credits roll, another of Tyler's raps - he's dressed in baseball cap and gold chain, of course - 99% of an empathy you may have had for the character has well and truly disappeared.",The Visit
58,GiraffeDoor,I think it would have worked better just done with an omnipresent camera.,5,8 August 2019,"In this permutation of the found footage genre there seems to be a pretence of the postmodern (by which I mean it's kind of self referential).Here the kids go to visit the grandparents and the sister is desperate to document it, basically to show how arty she is. They talk about directorial tropes and then do them.I like to remain open minded to all found footage movies. I know a lot of inexperienced film makers think they are a quick and cheap way to get their foot in the door and so they can be so generic... But I still want to believe that there are still some classics still in the marble because what brings you closer to the sensation of reality than not even having to suspend belief for the camera?But I'm not sure what they were going for here. This meta approach to the subgenre just seems to detract from the real story here. It could have been a pretty cool slow burn but the the particular approach with the narrative just seems to dilute it.A few really effective moments notwithstanding, this makes little sense, is too convinced of its own intelligence and is falls back on the familiar heavy handedness of movies of this type way too often.Which is a great pity.",The Visit
59,estebangonzalez10,Shyamalan getting back on track with a lower budget film,6,11 November 2015,"""Would you mind getting inside the oven to clean it?""I've always been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work despite his recent strikes, so The Visit was one of my most anticipated films for this year. I had stayed away from the trailers because I wanted to experience it as fresh as possible. Shyamalan has directed some of my favorite movies (The Sixth Sense, Signs, Unbreakable) and I even defended The Happening because I found it to be rather hilarious and it worked for me. The Visit has a similar approach in that it balances out the horror aspects of the film with the comedy (some may argue that in The Happening he never intended it to be a comedy but I disagree) although I wouldn't say it works as well. There are many funny scenes and a few jump scares that work, but overall the film doesn't seem to do much more than entertain. This is Shyamalan's lowest budget studio feature film and I think this is the kind of films he needs to be directing (staying away from big Hollywood productions like After Earth or The Last Airbender). Shyamalan has always worked best when he is contained and his films center on a few characters enclosed in a small space. In that way The Visit is a return to form for this talented director, who I've never questioned in the past. His decision to make this a found footage film also does wonders for the film, and I usually don't tend to be a fan of such a style. Everything is executed really well in The Visit and I was so enticed in the story that I was never really trying to discover what the twist would be at the end so when the revelation came I was pleasantly surprised. It probably wouldn't be too hard to figure out the twist if you were trying to search for it from the first minute, but if like me you simply let yourself enjoy the narrative then you will be pleased with the result. My problem with the film actually has to do with the final execution of the climax once the twist has been revealed. I wasn't a fan of the ending and that ultimately brought my score down a bit, but I still had a fun time with the movie.There is a perfectly believable reason why the film is shot in found footage style. Becca (Olivia DeJonge) wants to document her visit to her grandparents house and she gets her younger brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) to help in the process. She is a film fanatic and knows her way around the camera despite her young age. The reason she wants to document the visit is because her mother hasn't been in contact with them since she ran away from home as a teen. Becca believes she can heal the wounds between her mother (Kathryn Hahn) and her parents if she documents their story. The film takes its time to introduce each character before the grandkids head to meet their grandfathers for the first time. Tyler is very charismatic and loves to rap, while Becca is more of a quiet and studious girl. Their mother has been dealing with depression after her husband abandoned her, but is currently dating someone. After her parents reached out to her via email they ask if she could send the kids to spend a week with them so they can meet. Becca and Tyler both convince their mom to send them to their place, but once they arrive they discover that their grandparents seem to be hiding a secret of their own. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) seems to act in a very strange way once night falls and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) seems to have some issues of his own as he secretly comes in and out of the shed near the home. Of course this awakens the kids' curiosity and strange things ensue. Much of why I felt this film worked for me had to do with the cast. Ed Oxenbould, who I really wasn't a fan of in Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, gets to shine in this film. He carries the film for me and delivers much of the needed charm. The comedy is what works best in the film since there are really few scares, although I must admit that I did jump up from my seat a couple of times. Oxenbould was responsible for most of the funny scenes and I don't think this film could work for anyone if they find his character annoying. DeJonge as the older sister also delivers and is believable in her role although she doesn't seem to stay out. Deanna Dunagan is the creepiest of the grandparents and she delivers in some rather scary and tense moments. Even though I wasn't blown away by Peter McRobbie's performance he is responsible for the funniest scene in the movie which involved him being caught on tape with a shotgun to his mouth and after he immediately realizes it he claims to be cleaning out the gun. These moments of humor are what work best in the film and Oxenbould really delivers in that department with his sharp and witty commentaries. This might not be one of Shyamalan's best films, but it definitely is an improvement over his recent films. I was really enjoying this film up to the final five minutes where the comedy is pushed aside to build the climactic ending. Other than that I really enjoyed this film and I will continue to look forward to what Shyamalan will be doing next. He seems to be getting back on track and doing what he does best. Here he gets to tackle some of our fears involving old age and health and plays with them in a very inventive way. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Visit
60,dar0417,Saw this twist coming,6,6 February 2020,Nice try Shyamalan but I saw this one coming. Also please tell your friends found footage is not entertaining anymore and never really was. But this film was fun to watch and some scary scenes.,The Visit
61,jimbo-53-186511,Another lame found-footage film full of plot holes and inconsistencies,3,12 July 2016,"Brother and sister Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and Becca (Olivia DeJonge) are sent off to stay with their grandparents whilst their mother (portrayed by Kathryn Hahn) spends time with her new boyfriend. Becca is an aspiring filmmaker and decides to turn their visit to their grandparents into a documentary (as a way to learn more about them whilst simultaneously allowing her mother to learn more about her parents that she's been estranged from for many years). However, both Becca and Tyler start to notice that their grandparents are exhibiting strange behaviour and start to become increasingly concerned by the strange behaviour that their grandparents are exhibiting.I generally despise found-footage films and the reason I chose to watch The Visit was because I thought it was going to be more of a supernatural horror film rather than a found-footage film (the title suggests that there is going to be a supernatural theme involved). I watched it anyway hoping that it would at least be a halfway decent offering, but The Visit struggles even to be a mediocre film.In the early stages of the film I found it a little perplexing that a mother would send her children off to her parents house seemingly without speaking to them first. I mean even if you were in regular contact with your parents and were on good terms with them you would think that you would still check that it was alright to send your kids to them for a few days - a quick courtesy call would have been normal practice. This makes the later plot twist harder to digest; if she'd have spoken to her parents first (before sending her kids) then she'd have realised that the people staying in her parents house weren't actually her parents and thus the whole scenario would have been avoidable. I'm all for suspension of disbelief when watching films, but to me it seemed ludicrous that a parent would just send her kids off to her parent's house (whom she hasn't spoken to for some time) without checking first that they were still living there or even that they were still alive. To me, this is just the worst kind of negligent parenting.Things get worse when the kids report their concerns to their mother, but then the mother ends up dismissing everything that the kids are saying - the mother doesn't even think to speak to her parents and also doesn't seem concerned that the camera on her son's laptop is damaged (which is miraculously fixed and is working fine later in the film). None of this makes any sense and whilst it all makes the twist a little more surprising it's one that you feel you have no chance of working out because it makes little logical sense. This whole build up just points to some of the worst parenting imaginable as far as I was concerned.Going back to the camera on the laptop the film makes another leap of faith by expecting us to believe that someone could see 2 people clearly through a camera on a laptop from a distance of about 40 feet through a window which is partially obscured through net curtains. At this point the mother says 'They're not your grandparents!!!' - quite how she could ascertain this with so much confidence from that far away whilst looking through a lens on a laptop is anyone's guess.Once the twist is revealed then the film does shift up a gear (there are some creepy moments), but much of what Shayamalan has brought to us here isn't particularly original and a lot of it seems to have been borrowed from other found-footage films. One thing I also didn't like was the two kids in the film (they're bratty annoying and generally unlikeable which unfortunately is the way that most protagonists are portrayed in found-footage films). I also hate the way that a lot of found-footage films contain lots of scenes where the protagonists have inane and boring discussions (which more often than not don't seem to serve much purpose).Despite the bold claims the film isn't even particularly scary either (it's filled with cheap 'boo' moments, but other than that it's just an old women walking around, crawling around and at one point she seems to be dry-humping a wall which to me are not what I would call scary scenes).Oh yes and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse Shayamalan then treats us to a final rap song from younger brother Tyler who seems to be rapping about what you would assume was a traumatic and terrifying experience (yet the way it is delivered would suggest that he was unfazed by the experience even though he was clearly terrified at the time).This was a very odd way to end the film, but then again it's clear that logic and cohesion within the narrative were seemingly not important to Shyamalan at any stage during proceedings.",The Visit

The setup is clever & weird but it gets better & better as the two funny kids got to stay at the old farm house in a wintery setting & set out to document everything that happens by filming & interviewing everyone they meet & things get weird & strange with their grandparents especially at night, scary old weirdos lol creepy stuff & the kids film what's happening & it's clever & that's where the Found Footage element comes in & i admit i was never bored during this move, it kept me gripped from beginning to shocking end & the performances are all superb from everyone in the film.
SHYAMALAN is back with this neat, slick & well made little Shocker, it's very low-budget considering the huge mega budget movies he had just made with AFTER EARTH & AIRBENDER & i like it more as it feels back to his old roots of very uneasy atmosphere & an intense build up to a surprisingly shocking end.
Some bits in this flick are really scary & frightening & not much creeps me out these days as I'm a big Horror fan but THE VISIT is a nice surprise & a great hit for SHYAMALAN who is still a genius he just needs to do more low-budget & personal stuff & here even in this creepy Thriller he has a heart to it & a family that's broken by their past & we find out what's bothering everyone as the film unfolds.A really good Creepy Thriller that's funny & disturbing",The Visit
63,kluseba,The creative mastermind of contemporary psycho thrillers redeems himself,8,18 September 2015,"M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most fascinating and controversial contemporary directors. His newest independent movie goes back to his roots and offers an increasingly addicting plot, a solid acting performance and a twist that is so simple you might not even see it coming. The creative Indian artist manages to make a convincing movie despite a limited budget, a rather unexperienced crew and a lot of found footage material that is usually employed in some of the worst contemporary horror films like ''Devil's Due''. In this movie, the idea of the found footage material makes sense for once and even adds some intimate depth to the two main characters. The fact that two young and rather unknown actors are taking the lead somehow adds to the credibility of the scenario. Even the limited budget turns out to be an advantage since this movie comes around without any distracting special effects. Still, the camera angles, the lighting techniques and the soundtrack are decently chosen and add to an overall positive impression.What makes this movie stand out is its curious mixture of genres. In fact, M. Night Shyamalan once said that there are three different versions of this film and I'm really curious to watch the other two. One version is an over-the-top comedy flick, the second is a creepy horror movie and the cinematic choice that I'm reviewing right now is in fact a convincing mixture of both. Let's add that the beginning of this movie almost feels like a mixture of a documentary and a reality television show. Most of the times, humorous horror movies can't convince me and feel ridiculous to me since I even disliked the original ''Evil Dead'' flicks. In this clever case, the movie starts with a few awkward scenes where the audience might not be sure whether they should laugh or feel scared which adds to the overall uneasy atmosphere of the film. In the beginning, one doesn't clearly know where this movie is going to lead us. There are a few creepy horror movie sequences. Other moments feel like light slapstick comedy scenes. The behaviour of some characters shows hints at a solid psycho thriller. The background story of the movie includes dramatic elements. M. Night Shyamalan leads us to a surprisingly coherent and entertaining potpourri of genres before the final thirty minutes of this cinematic cut clearly prove that this version ends up being a gruesome psycho thriller or horror movie. The twisting and turning story is so captivating that the final twist comes almost unexpectedly despite its simplicity.It has become an almost popular trend to expose M. Night Shyamalan's most recent efforts to unjustified prejudice but let me tell you that true fans of this director and the psycho thriller and horror genres will get more than they could expect from this movie. Despite its subtle diversity, this film is to the point and never loses its clear guiding line. Despite its slow build-up, the film always remains entertaining and even gripping. This movie might not be the director's opus magnum but its mixture of grounded cinematic elements and experimental influences from diverse genres makes this one of the director's best movie of the past ten years and one of the better psycho thrillers or horror movies of a rather unconvincing cinematic year 2015. If you are a sucker for any of these two genres, I can warmly recommend this movie to you.",The Visit
64,davispittman,Fresh scary thriller,8,30 November 2017,"The Visit is M Night Shamylan's return to making good films. He churned out some pretty bad ones for a period of time. The last airbender and the happening were both films that bombed horribly, which was shocking given that his previous movies like the sixth sense, signs and the village were all hits. This movie received positive reviews, and for good reason. The plot revolves around children that are being sent to stay with their grandparents, whom they have never meet because of a falling out between their mother and them. They begin to see once they arrive at their grandparents that things might not be alright with their grandparents. Their grandparents begin to act in very strange manners. For instance, the grandmother staying up all night and scratching the walls in the nude is one example of the frightening behaviors that go on while they are staying with them. The twists and turns that occur in most Shamylan films do happen here as well. And I for one really enjoyed the twists in the plot, made things much more interesting and exciting.

67,ferbs54,Projectile Vomiting Never Seemed So Creepy....,8,26 April 2017,"Just caught my fifth film by writer/producer/director M. Night Shyamalan, 2015's ""The Visit,"" which I enjoyed infinitely more than last week's ""Lady in the Water."" In this one, two young kids, a 15-year-old girl and her 13-year-old brother, go to visit their grandparents in the Pennsylvania farm country. This is the first time that they are meeting the grandparents, with whom their own mom (Kathryn Hahn) had had a falling out many years before, and the young girl plans to document the entire visit with her video cameras. Thus, the entire film is of that curious horror category known as the ""found footage"" subgenre, and the director here uses it to chilling effect. The kids find that their grandfolks are quite the decided oddballs, indeed; as a matter of fact, the grandmother suffers from the condition known as ""sundowning"" (Shyamalan's original title for the film), during which she goes absolutely nuts when the sun goes down. And that is just the beginning of what turns out to be a most hellacious visit for these two kids. Shyamalan manages to insert one doozy of a third-act plot twist into this film, one that surely did catch me by surprise. All four of the relatively unknown actors here (Olivia De Jonge, who is remarkably pretty, and Ed Oxenbould as the kids, and Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie as the dotty grandparents) give wonderful performances, and there are any number of scenes guaranteed to send the ice water coursing down the viewer's spine. Most definitely a winner for this very interesting director. Loved it!",The Visit
68,TOMNEL,One of the best films of the now ubiquitous faux-documentary horror genre,9,14 September 2015,"What looked like yet another (terrible) found footage/faux-documentary turns out to be M. Night Shyamalan's best movie in over 10 years. ""The Visit"" manages to build dread throughout while also being thematically rich.Becca and Tyler are visiting their estranged grandparents whom they have never met for week, while their mother (who hasn't spoken to her parents in years after an unidentified incident) goes on a cruise with a man she's dating. Becca is a 15-year old wannabe auteur filmmaker who documents the entire week long trip trying to make a film about the reconciliation of her grandparents and her mother, while Tyler is a 13-year old rapper who is skeptical from the get-go about his grandparents. Both children have insecurities brought on from their father leaving their mother five years prior. As the week goes on, their ""Nana"" and ""Pop Pop"" begin acting stranger and stranger, from attacking strangers to projectile vomiting, and the kids switch from making a heartwarming documentary to figuring out what's wrong with their insane, and often violent grandparents.The performances are all top notch. Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould play Becca and Tyler, respectively, and both are distinct, well performed and well written characters. Often adults don't know how to write for children, but the writing here is smart, and feels natural. There weren't moments of ""kiddy"" dialogue that induced groaning or eye-rolling. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) also give excellent performances that progress from normalcy to sheer insanity as the film moves on.Thematically there is more to the movie than just scary grandparents. The characters have depth. We learn about their insecurities, and why they have them, and there are actual resolutions and payoffs to the plot points. In comparison, the ""Paranormal Activity"" films are mostly just boring nonsense waiting for a few jump scares. Here, there is no boring nonsense. There might be occasional nonsense, but it's not boring, and it's mostly for comedic effect. Similar to many of Shyamalan's films of yesteryear, this does have some sort of twist to it, but it's one that feels natural and makes your heart sink into your stomach.This is also M. Night Shyamalan's first film that could be labeled as a comedy. His previous films were often so serious that they bordered on over-self importance. Purposely or not, the pretentious filmmaker attitude of Becca actually seems to mirror the audience perception of how Shyamalan approaches his craft. Assuming it is purposeful, there are several laughs at the expense of the auteur filmmaker, and lots of laughs in general in this picture. But the humor and over the top horror are grounded by a nice level of drama that makes the picture rewarding.Overall, this is a welcome treat for fans of Shyamalan's best films, and people who aren't yet tired of the faux-documentary approach that horror films have been taking recently. Great performances, surprisingly good comedy, and often edge of your seat, this is one of the better, if not the best of this genre which started with ""Blair Witch"" 16-years ago and sadly has only become more prevalent. Hopefully it's the start of an upturn for the career of M. Night Shyamalan who shows here that he still has the ability to effectively tap into our emotions.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. PG-13 (contains violence, terror, rear nudity and language). 94 mins.",The Visit
69,aidanratesmovies,Much better than I anticipated,10,19 October 2020,"A compelling, well crafted, and incredibly unique little caper- The Visit not only reaffirms Shamalyan's talent- but also provides something new and well made- even despite its smaller budget. First off, the acting in the film is great. As always Olivia DeJonge is a standout, but the biggest standouts of the film have to be Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie who play the grandparents. Kathryn Hahn and Ed Oxenbould also do their best, but at times you do feel like they are pretty much playing themselves. I enjoyed the handheld camera point of view throughout the film, and thought it truly encaptured the claustrophobic nightmare that these children have been trapped in. There are certainly some funny moments throughout, even some attempted scares that can earn a chuckle, but there are also quite a few decent scares and of course a shocking twist that makes the film all the more better. I enjoyed the look of the film too, and thought the house in the middle of the country in the winter time truly added more to the atmosphere as well as the many other visual nightmares that took place in it and around it. In the end, The Visit is easily one of Shyamalan's best and is easily one of the most simple but original horror flicks in some time.

70,valleyjohn,Someone kill that kid - Please,5,19 October 2015,"M. Night Shyamalan has had many critics over the years and quite rightly so because since making The Sixth Sense he has made some shockingly bad films. The Visit is not up there with the worst films he has made but as with a Shyamalan film it has many faults. This is the story of a brother and sister who are sent to their grandparents in the country , who they have never met before while their mum goes on vacation and they turn out to be just a little bit odd. The biggest problem i have with this is surprisingly not the story but it's the kids , or one in particular . The boy. I can't remember seeing a screen kid more annoying and i was willing bad things to happen to him. There are some spooky moments but not nearly enough and the director's attempt to add humour to the film , failed miserably . Evil Dead it ain't.",The Visit
71,truemythmedia,Above Par for M. Night.,6,3 June 2019,"I went into this movie not really expecting to care much about anything that happened, and I ended up kind of enjoying myself. This movie starts off in an extremely annoying way as both of our protagonists are precocious, insufferable teens, but it gets better when the children reach their Grandparent's house and crazy stuff starts to happen. I want to say first off that this movie is pushing the PG-13 boundaries; there are lots of genuinely creepy images in this, there's some pretty horrific violence involving teenagers, some swears, and even some old lady nudity. I was kind of surprised this wasn't rated R. As far as M. Night goes, this one was actually one of the better flicks in his filmography; it's nowhere near the level of ""Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", or even ""Unbreakable"", but it's a thousand times better than ""The Happening"".",The Visit
72,robertemerald,Limited moments of terror toward the end,6,8 January 2020,"The whole idea for The Visit was pretty good, but the terrifying secret had to be revealed much sooner than in the second to last chapter (after at least six other chapters). And, had the terror been introduced in say, the third chapter, the filmmaker had to be prepared to come up with some sort of evolving torture, tension or chase, in order to keep us entertained for the rest of the picture, as is the case with many excellent home invasion movies. In a way I feel that this Director has only had half an idea for a movie, but he came up with another idea of how he could make half an idea work as a whole movie. That second idea is both the half-genius, and half-failure for this movie, and seems to involve framing the footage as a school documentary project, like Blair Witch (1999), only he's wise enough to avoid the camera shake and involve two cameras plus a computer, and a dash of good photography here and there. For me, however, the premise is dubious. The original premise, that an increasing demented and rapidly ageing couple first murder their companions, another old couple, then send for the grandchildren of the murdered couple (who have never met them). They start living in the murdered couple's big old house, assuming, with quite a sprinkle of public dotage, their identities. So far gone are these two oldies that they continue to struggle with their dementia even after the kids arrive. Obviously when the kids finally realise the couple are not their grandparents that's when the fun, belatedly, arrives. I get it. Terrifying. Thing is, the old couple are so demented that they easily bungle their attempt to kill the children. In any case, they must have known the gig was up should two innocent and much loved children disappear. I guess that's the point of the movie. Old people with dementia don't have logic. If this is a movie about dementia then it's in poor taste. If it's a quirky horror oddity, which I think is what the Director must have been aiming for, then it is moderately successful. But it's not all that scary, just odd, for most of the movie. Strangely, the false grandma tells a tale one day of aliens that infect drinking water, which allows them to incapacitate their human victims, keeping them alive but comatose and hidden at the bottom of a lake, ready for delivery back to their home planet. For a while I was waiting to see the alien hosts that must be causing all this illogical, sorry, demented, madness, you know, like that movie I Am Not A Serial Killer (2016). Alas, in the end, despite an alternate ending on the dvd, they never did actually appear.",The Visit
73,Samiam3,Shyamalan returning to form.,6,6 June 2017,"Starting with The Village, Shyamalan began on a steep decent into the pits as his movies grew increasingly shapeless, and preposterous.But here is a movie that allows him to get away with being both, and still have something to offer. Two kids hop a train to spend a week (or so) with their grandparents' who turn out to be more uncomfortably senile than they anticipated. With each passing day and night, their supposedly humble country home gets creepier. Shyamalan has found a couple of young actors who are good enough to carry the movie. One of the joys is that Shyamalan plays this picture partially for laughs, although some elders in the audience, or anyone whose parents suffer dementia might take offence at some jokes. In terms of horror, the film is lightly scary. Shyamalan manages to conjure some nail biting suspense in a couple of scenes but mostly what we get is a series of creepy one offs, like the discovery of dozens of soiled diapers in the tool shed. For the most part, the Visit is not visually remarkable although there is a nice shot near the ending of an epileptic grandma enveloped in a bed sheet like the ghost she becomes. At least the camcorder style of photography is coherent. Shyamalan pulls off a clever (though not extraordinary twist) to kick off the third act, but the last couple of scenes are a bit over the top. I'd recommend it as a good pick for a date movie on Halloween night.",The Visit
74,pachara87,The Visit is a pleasant surprise.,9,9 December 2018,"Shyamalan doesn't do anything revolutionary here, but he works the found-footage trope about as well as it can be worked, often finding inventive and crafty ways to create unnerving compositions that look accidental, rather than planned.",The Visit
75,jadepietro,Not Worth a Visit,4,15 September 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)This film is not recommended. In brief: Not only is the camera-work shaky, so is the film itself.GRADE: CVisiting my grandparents every Sunday afternoon with my parents and brothers in tow was a family tradition. I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but it wasn't that high on my ""to do"" list. Neither was M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller, The Visit. Sadly, my initial reaction was very accurate.The director / screenwriter tells his story of two siblings, Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge), a fledgling auteur filmmaker and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) a precocious rapper wannabe, who go to meet and greet their grandparents for a memorable weekend while their mother (Kathryn Kahn) is off on a cruise with her boyfriend. Nana and Pop Pop (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are more strange than estranged and their baby-sitting techniques are spotty than spot-on. The words and actions of the elders don't gel as night approaches and the children aren't nestled comfortably in their beds. The Visit takes this intriguing premise and slowly adds its element of suspense, danger and humor with some success. But the film disappoints. This children-in-peril tale lacks originality and its creepiness arrives in short spurts. Scares are at a minimum.Shyamalan uses ironic humor well, blaming the grandparents' odd behavior on senility issues as he establishes his characters and hints at possible ominous clues as the film goes along its merry way. However, his execution of his source material undercuts the tension and horror elements by relying too heavily on the overdone found video footage approach (dating back to 1999's The Blair Witch Project) with its overt in-your-face camera-work and skewed angles so prevalent in today's horror film genres. While this may help to dramatically cut down of production costs and give a more realistic edge to the spooky happenings, the overall effect becomes a predictable cliché of its times. Fortunately, his script keeps the action moving and the cast, especially Ms. Dunagan, has a rousing good time with the eerie goings-on. There's an interesting story here, but the artsy direction and its gimmicky hand-held camera-work obscures most of the action and ruins any suspense. The twist, Shyamalan's usual hook in storytelling, doesn't make logical sense in afterthought and never builds to a satisfying end. While the film is better than most of the director's cinematic results in his past decade of filmmaking, it is below par nevertheless. Simply stated, don't visit The Visit.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",The Visit
76,Seraphion,Took the curious all the way,5,9 October 2015,"The story really isn't that interesting at first. Also with all the trailer scenes already kind of leaked the scary parts, this movie quite literally didn't have anything to offer anymore. What interested me into watching this movie is purely the fact that it stood on the box office a few weeks ago, when it's not the month of Halloween yet. After I'm all about 20 minutes into the movie, I've already figured out about the grandparents may not be who they say they are, so that really takes all the surprise out. But having seen many of M. Night Shyamalan's works, I still watch this movie to the end, still being curious at how will this movie develop even more. And as I predicted, like all other Shyamalan movies this movie really serve a good dose of mystery and thriller side that comes on screen suddenly without significant buildup before. But like other Shyamalan works this movie also leaves the audience with not so satisfactory climax at the ending. The whole POV camera angles is just the fresh new take to add to Shyamalan movies, although it's been a common thing in horror genre nowadays. The acting overall is a little bit below standards for me as Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould did just enough for their parts but didn't really quite build on the whole brotherhood between their characters.",The Visit
77,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Visit,6,20 September 2015,"For the past couple of weeks, I've been hearing from critics that The Visit (my latest review) is the utter comeback film for Mr. M. Night Shyamalan. Interesting. If that's the case, then why is he bent on ripping off The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity via the first hour in. Listen Night, I know you've been taking a ribbing for not living up to the stature that is The Sixth Sense. But this hand-held, found footage thing seems so tired now, it might need a veritable doze. Time to ""visit"" something else dude.Filmed in rural Pennsylvania (that's the Shyamalan way you know), featuring a surprise twist that I didn't see coming (I'm probably the only Dodo bird critic that didn't pick up on that one), and being rather generous for its PG-13 rating (I feel this thing should have garnered a hard R), The Visit does what many Shyamalan films do. It builds to a slow creep while you wait for the gotcha cessation. The story begins with the Jamison family. Paula Jamison (the perky Kathryn Hahn) is a single mother of two. Her husband left her to move to California and she hasn't seen her parents in about 15 years. On a whim, she decides to go on vacation with her new boyfriend while her kids (Olivia DeJonge as Rebecca Jamison and Ed Oxenbould as Tyler Jamison) take a trip to their grandparents farmhouse in the bleak, Keystone State. Here's the rub: Said grandparents contacted Paula through the Internet so Rebecca and Tyler are meeting them for the very first time. Chaos then ensues when John Jamison (Peter McRobbie) and Doris Jamison (played by Deanna Dunagan who gives the film's best performance) begin to act weird and creep out their fragile, young kin. Suicidal tendencies, scaling walls, collective feces, and dead bodies in the basement are what's on tap for you the viewer. Oh and with the tagline for The Visit being ""Don't ever leave your room after 9:30 p.m."", I thought it could be up there with ""I see dead people"". In the case of this flick, the stars weren't quite aligned.In retrospect, there's a few chills to be had, a few jolts, and the performances by the old timers are pretty impressive (the kid actors on the other hand, are quite annoying). But in the end, it's just a movie about two adolescents trapped in a house with a couple of crazy, deranged denizens (where else are the whippersnappers supposed to go, it's in the middle of nowhere). Sadly, these two unhinged grandparents aren't aliens or ghosts. They're just whacked out of their minds. As for Shyamalan, well he seems to excel with certain shots when he's not letting the young actors film documentary style. Big mistake. He should have just cropped the whole hand-held facet, dropped the incorporated comedy (which is good yet becomes embarrassing when a rap act takes over the closing credits), and just let it ride. Oh well. The Visit isn't awful but it's no where near as epic (or eerie) as his first three films. My rating: A nontoxic 2 and a half stars.Of note: With The Visit, you can easily tell what's jittery fodder and what amounts to some capable direction from M. Night. My suggestion would have been to separate the two. Maybe have the found footage crap subjugate through a different lens or have its rec insignia placed in the right hand corner. It's an oversight at best and probably wouldn't bring greatness to fruition. Anyway, look for some gross moments here (a seventy-year-old woman runs naked and there are various scenes of poop in a diaper, yikes!) and a couple of Dutch angles right before a disturbing game of Yahtzee. Oof!",The Visit
78,rannynm,Terrifying and Disappointing,3,14 September 2015,"The first thing I'll say about this film it that it is truly terrifying. I screamed out loud several times and on more than one occasion I contemplated getting up and leaving the theater so that I wouldn't have to endure yet another image to send my heart into my throat. I did, however, stay through the entire film to watch the madness unfold. Other than the accomplishment of turning the entire audience into a frightened bunch of individuals screaming and covering their faces, this film is less than amazing. The cinematography is almost too good for what it is conveying. It is done from a first-person perspective with the two children are filming everything or placing cameras around the house. The premise of the story is that Becca, the 15-year-old daughter, is making a documentary about her grandparents to try to mend their relationship with her mother. However, the quality of the filming makes it hard to believe that it is the work of two young teens. That being said, the quality of the cinematography on its own is exceptional, but it does not help the realism of what the film is trying to portray.Then, there's the acting. The mother, played by Kathryn Hahn is the only recognizable face in the cast full of breakthrough actors, so this is probably the first feature length film that many of the actors have starred in. Let me say that the performance by Deanna Dunagan (Nana) is the best out of the entire film. She is truly frightening and does a remarkable job transforming from a kindly and forgetful old woman into the sinister character that still haunts me.Then, there's the rest of the cast. Many of the moments in the film appear entirely forced and anything but organic. There is an awkward sense of comedy that comes into play at times that seem inappropriate and unhelpful for the plot. On occasion, the comedic moments give way for some relief when the horror aspect becomes intense, but mainly it takes away from the integrity of the film and feels too forced to be enjoyed. Another reason that the acting in this film is questionable is that way too often, characters in the film go on rants that last longer than necessary and slowly unravel into a performance that is less than believable and feels more like an audition tape than a blockbuster moment. I began to lose interest and belief in the characters and it took me out engagement in the film.The film revolves around Becca, Tyler, Nana and Pop Pop. The mother and a few concerned neighbors drop in from time to time, but the majority of the film focuses on these four main individuals. It is very important that these well developed characters since they are the focal point for the whole film. However, the characters of Pop Pop and Nana are simply overdone. Nana is by far the most provoking character in the film, but there are moments when she spirals into unnecessary behavior. Nana and Pop Pop are supposedly insane, suffering from what some might deduce as schizophrenia, dementia or Alzheimer's. This makes for a frightening cocktail of mental illness, triggering the terrifying nature of the film. However, M. Night Shyamalan goes out of his way to give them every textbook and stereotypical symptom involved with this batch of mental illness. Pop Pop is the most noticeable as he has just about every single symptom that is associated with being old and crazy and it completely takes away from the authenticity of the character. He goes on rants explicitly showcasing all of his symptoms and, when this happens you could hear an audible sigh of disappointment and boredom from the audience. Nana's character is not as affected by these excessive textbook-symptoms. But there is one scene when Nana is having quite a moving moment in an interview with Becca and then she spouts off about creatures from another planet and goes onto say ""oh and they have antennae...but they're invisible...but only I can see them...and one day they will take us back to their planet and we will be saved."" None of this contributes to the story and it is the only time that Nana exhibits these specific symptoms. So, it does not help build her character nor does it aid the plot.The last main complaint I have is the ending. The film appears to end in such a perfect way and if the last five minutes of the film were cut out, I probably wouldn't be sitting here writing this. After the assumed ending of the film fades to black, it pops back up with an interview of the mother. Here we have yet another monologue moment where she shares ""touching"" and ""meaningful"" information about her parents and then ties in the supposed moral of the film...""Don't hold onto anger."" She sheds some tears and then shows some fake home videos of the children as toddlers. This is an unnecessary attempt to tie in some deeper meaning to the film and create an emotional ending that is not needed in the slightest and left me, and from my observations, many of the other audience members quite disappointed. The film finally ends with a comical rap done by 13-year-old Tyler, which, while entertaining, is an unnecessary addition to the ending that made me forget the genuine and fearful moments I had experienced previously that make this film worthwhile. I give The Visit 2.5 out of 5 stars. This movie did scare me, but other than that it is all over the place and felt very forced. However, if you're looking to be scared and disturbed, then check out The Visit. Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 18. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.",The Visit
79,Matt_Layden,Could have done without the rapping.,6,5 November 2015,"The big question on people's mind seems to be, is The Visit a return to form for the once promising director, M. Night Shyamalan. The answer is yes and no. While the film is leaps and bounds better than his last 4 previous efforts which include: the dreadful After Earth, the boring Last Airbender, the inane The Happening and the disappointing Lady in the Water, it fails to be anything more than another entry in a long list of horror found footage films. Yes, M. Night Shyamalan has fallen far my friends, so much that just his name on the screen invokes laughter and groans from the audience. He has to fall back and rely on an overused horror genre to bring some sort of credit to his tarnished legacy.His entry into the found footage genre is The Visit. What Jaws did for the water, The Visit might do for old people. When a mother of two young kids is contacted by her estranged parents, asking to finally see their grandkids, she decides to let her kids go live with their grandparents for the week, while she goes away on vacation. The kids are so excited that the film loving daughter decides to make a documentary about it. Bringing her trusted camera along for the ride, she captures some odd footage from her grandparents and weirder and weirder things start happening after 9:30. So we have to ask ourselves, what's wrong with NaNa and Pop Pop???The one thing this film does right is something that Shyamalan seems to do well or at least use to, is create a terrific atmosphere. The old home has just enough corners here and there to raise the tension, to make us as ourselves, ""What's behind the corner over there?"" Having the film be a found footage picture, gives Shyamalan more control over the camera. He can choose what to reveal and when is trickier ways which put the characters in a bit more danger. One terrific sequence where Shyamalan is really at his best is when the kids decide to play Hide and Seek under the house. You expect the unexpected and Shyamalan delivers probably the best scene he's done in years. The grandparents are excellent; they convey just the right amount of oddness and sympathy. Each scene that they have alone with the kids is when they try to explain away the weirdness of the other. NaNa describes why Pop Pop does the things he does and vice versa. It was an interesting dynamic between the characters that immediately tells you that they are hiding something. Unfortunately, the same can't really be said about the children. Two unbelievable kids, which means I did not believe anything they did was genuine. Whether it is rapping, yes the kid raps a lot, or the cinematic dialogue the girl uses. Nothing they said or did ring true to me, which took me out of the experience. The Visit is creepy enough to warrant a watch for those that love the found footage films. It's shot in a way that doesn't lead to vertigo or nausea. You finally have a film where you get to see everything that happens on the screen, which was a nice change of pace. Shyamalan might not be back in the good graces of people, but The Visit is a decent start.",The Visit
80,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Effective, but inconsistent",6,23 February 2016,"Two young siblings go to visit their grandparents (to whom their mother has not spoken in many years) at a remote house in the country, which is quickly snowed-in, isolating them, and sealing them in. The film has a good atmosphere, I'm a sucker for a story about a group of people trapped by a snowstorm, and the movie has a few good scares to it. As the older of the two, Olivia DeJonge was quite good, and the final twist was good, but completely implausible, and the film goes on two scenes too long. It also can't decide if it wants to be a thriller or comedy, and it touches on supernatural themes at times too, which don't really work with the rest of the plot.The film plays out partly as a found footage movie, but it worked that into the plot well, as we learn Olivia DeJonge's character is an aspiring filmmaker. Sadly though, we also learn her kid brother is an aspiring rapper, in the most frightening moments in the film.",The Visit
81,brando647,Shyamalan's Best in Over a Decade; Not a Major Accomplishment...,5,28 September 2016,"I suppose the last M. Night Shyamalan movie I didn't hate was THE VILLAGE. I'm not saying that was a good movie, but it was all downhill after that. I haven't even watched his films since LADY IN THE WATER, but THE VISIT was getting some semi-solid reviews so I figured it was time to see how Shyamalan was doing. THE VISIT is a relatively toothless PG-13 horror movie and it's a ""found footage"" film, so we're not starting on very strong ground. It's told from the perspective of young Becca (Olivia DeJonge), an aspiring documentarian who has decided to record her visit to her estranged grandparents as a gift to her mother (Kathryn Hahn). Her mother had left home right after graduation under hostile circumstances and she hasn't seen her parents since. When they reach out to reconnect on Facebook, she agrees to allow Becca and her little brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) to visit for a week while she goes on vacation with her boyfriend. At first it's all smiles and cookies with Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie), but the elderly pair start to exhibit signs of bizarre behavior. Pop Pop says Nana suffers from a condition known as ""sundowning"" to explain her strange nocturnal activities but the children soon begin to suspect there's more going on than what they've been told. But with limited communication with the outside world (no phone signal, no WiFi) and their mother's dismissive response (""They're just old""), these kids are about to discover the truth.About six minutes into this movie, we're introduced to young Tyler's alter ego: ""T- Diamond Stylus"". This means that, about six minutes into this movie, I almost removed the disc and put it in the microwave. T-Diamond Stylus is Tyler's rap persona and, while one instance of cringe-worthy kid rap is enough to send my interest into a steep decline, we're treated to a few of his improvised bits. I can't describe how much I hated it and his YouTube wannabe-celebrity obsession. His sister is almost as bad, flaunting her eloquence from early on so we all know how intelligent and well- spoken she is in comparison. They're insufferable at first but become a little easier to stomach once the weight of the situation brings them both back down to Earth a bit. We're also forced to endure a subplot of each of them dealing with their father's absence in their own ways, which might be interesting in a drama (or even a meatier psychological horror) but I'm watching THE VISIT for creepy old folks and saw this as nothing more than an unnecessary speed bump in the grand scheme of the plot. My last big problem with THE VISIT is the unnecessary use of the found footage style. I can't figure out why Shyamalan bothered to make this found footage when it adds absolutely nothing to the film and, in fact, I bet this movie would've been even better if it had been done traditionally. He might've hoped it would add more tension but it doesn't.Complaints aside, I don't dislike THE VISIT. It's a lean 90 minutes but, admittedly, it still finds ways of dragging in the middle. The kidswell, really just Beccatake far too long to realize their grandparents might be unstable. There's a scene in the movie's trailer where one of the children stumbles upon Pop Pop in the barn with the business end of a shotgun in his mouth. That child is Becca, the older and theoretically more mature child, and this scene isn't near the end of the movie when things are going nuts. This scene occurs in the middle of the film and Becca never once questions his obviously suicidal nature or skittish response that he was ""just cleaning it"". And because Becca fails to address this important discovery, we're forced to wait even longer before something truly interesting happens. I will acknowledge that Shyamalan does successfully make this elderly couple effectively creepy. He ramps it up gradually with innocent oddities at first that could be attributed to dementia or normal generation gap awkwardness, but then there's Nana's ""sundowning"". That's where a lot of the creepiest stuff happens with Nana scrambling around the house after dark in a frenzy. It's Dunagan and McRobbie make THE VISIT worth, um, visiting. They nail their performances and, with the kids as annoying as they are for the first half of the film, you might even root for them. Just think: if the grandparents had gotten their wish, we wouldn't have had to suffer another T-Diamond Stylus performance over the end credits.",The Visit
82,begob,Watch it!,8,10 December 2015,"A bossy sister and her precocious brother are sent by mother to visit their estranged grandparents at a remote farmstead. She films it all in an attempt to understand the estrangement, and he joins in - but things get weird. And fast.Oooh, so much quality to this. It's a 1st person POV story, but with two 1st persons, and the best shaky cam you'll ever see. Full of jokes about movie making, with gorgeous dialogue, acting and editing, but also a real sense of dread. And no jump scares, just a creeping confusion of menace. Muchos pleasure.Not a pure horror, because everything is explained rationally in the end. My fangs got drawn in at the reveal, which I think came a little early anyway - my one serious complaint. Also, the 1st person POV was strained in the climax, not quite believable. Plus it's Shyamalan, so horror fans are driven in to the shadows as hope reigns supreme.The music is judged perfectly for mood. Not familiar with the pieces, so worth looking into.Overall - every minute fascinating to watch as an experienced story teller draws in his audience. Not the greatest, but very clever and definitely worth watching again.",The Visit
83,moviewizguy,"M. Night is Back, Baby!",8,2 September 2015,"It's hard to talk about any M. Night films these days without discussing his career trajectory, how he started off incredibly strong with a triple knockout of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, only to have his potential squandered, or at least questioned, with films like The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth. As a fan of Shyamalan myself, even I had to admit that he may have lost his luster. With that being said, I'm overjoyed and elated to say that The Visit is Shyamalan's best film since The Village over 10 years ago (my personal favorite). And it's not so bad it's good. The Visit is a legitimately good film, with great performances, terrific setups and even better payoffs, and an overall simple but satisfying story, which is all Shyamalan needs right now.It's difficult to say much about the story without revealing too much, because The Visit is essentially the type of film where it's better the less you know going in. It's not to say the film is filled with plot twists left and right, but how cleverly it subverts expectations, especially based on the film's misleading marketing campaign. Let this be known: The Visit is a horror AND comedy. It's downright hilarious (intentionally so) during a majority of the film but also equally scary and creepy, which is what M. Night is known for. I was laughing hysterically and screaming, sometimes at the same time! The success of the film is how effectively it jumps in between the two genres and frequently on the dime. The third act showcases this in the best possible way and in full Shyamalan fashion.Though there are plenty of laughs and screams to be had, The Visit is also filled with surprising moments of drama. There are, at the very least, three genuinely beautiful scenes. One of those involves a zoom in of a certain character, and it's utterly heartbreaking. Credit must be given to Shyamalan who manages to get great performances from his actors, a welcome change after the stilted and wooden performances in his last few films. Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould play the leads, and they're completely likable in their roles. Oxenbould, in particular, steals every scene he's in, providing many of the film's biggest laughs. Seriously, the jokes in here are funnier than most comedies released these days. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie are also rightfully creepy as the kids' offbeat grandparents. Last but not least, Kathryn Hahn leaves a great impression, despite the limited screen time she has. She's truly wonderful here.Overall, The Visit is ridiculously entertaining and a total crowd pleaser. It's the film we were all hoping for Shyamalan to make to get him out of the slump. No, it's not as great as his first four films, but it's a step towards the right direction. Recently, it's been revealed that he'll reunite with producer Jason Blum and Joaquin Phoenix for a new project. If it's another low budget feature like The Visit, which it most likely will be, we might be witnessing an era of Shyamalascance. After all, going back to basics is his greatest asset right now. Who says horror/comedy can't work?UPDATE: The film is even better the second time around, and I noticed a lot of details I missed during the first viewing. There's even clever meta humor sprinkled throughout that might not be apparent at first. Additionally, I'd like to put a spotlight on Deanna Dunagan, who I didn't give enough credit to beforehand. She was fantastic. How great and fulfilling it is for an actress her age to have a role that is complicated and complex as is the character of Nana, to be sweet and motherly in one scene only to switch (convincingly) to creepy and insane the next. In one especially dramatic scene, you will even ache for her. Only if you stop to think will you notice the many layers Dunagan has to play with, and for that reason, she should be praised.",The Visit
84,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"The M. Night Shyamalan we knew and loved is back, baby! ""The Visit"" is a wickedly-entertaining and occasionally spine-tingling dose of pure, unadulterated horror-comedy-fun!",8,6 February 2016,"Let's have a little history lesson, shall we?Back in 1999, the world was rocked by the release of an excellent horror film that harkened back to the sort-of classic haunted-house chillers that thrilled audiences since the dawn of film. I am of course referring to the wonderful ""The Sixth Sense""... a film that even to this day holds itself high as a prime example of fantastic storytelling thanks to a wonderful and unpredictable script, and some very solid visual direction courtesy of then-unknown filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan.Shyamalan rode the wave of ""The Sixth Sense"" with two more similarly excellent films... ""Unbreakable""- a dramatic and slow-burning take on the idea behind superhero-mythos. And ""Signs""- a personal and thrilling horror film about isolation and the loss of faith, set against the backdrop of an alien invasion storyline.Shyamalan could do no wrong. He was called the next Spielberg... even the next Hitchcock.Then... well, ""The Village"" happened. It was a misstep... most seem to agree. But we shrugged it off, telling ourselves ""Hey, every great artist makes at least ONE bad film... his next one will be better!""Then ""Lady in the Water."" ""The Happening."" ""The Last Airbender."" ""After Earth."" Jeez dude... are we even sure this is the same guy who brought us ""I see dead people""?No longer were audiences eagerly awaiting the next Shyamalan epic. Because after three great films, his fall from grace seemed to grow exponentially with each new release. But I didn't give up. I know that the mind who gave us those three masterpieces had to have at least one more good film in him. I had to keep my faith in him, even if his track-record begged me to differ.And thankfully, that faith paid off with ""The Visit""... a wickedly entertaining horror-comedy done in the popular ""found-footage"" style that for the first time in over a decade, reminds us just why we fell in love with Shyamalan to begin with.We follow two young children- sister Rebecca and brother Tyler- as they prepare to visit their grandparents for the first time. Because of the rift that had formed between her mother and her grandparents, teen- aged Rebecca decides to film their visit as a personal documentary project. However, despite a pleasant beginning to their week-long stay, things start to seem... strange. And it becomes clearer with each passing day that ""Nana"" and ""Pop-Pop"" might not just be the eccentric elderly folk their grandchildren initially suspected them of being... no, they may be darker, more dangerous presences that could bring them face to face with a dark fate...It's hard to discuss this film without going into dreaded spoiler- territory due to the simplicity of the proceedings, so I want to remain as vague as possible. But the strength in the film really revolves around the excellent cast of relative-unknowns and the wonderful execution of a simple concept that lends itself well to both great laughs and terrifying thrills.And this definitely is through-and-through a horror-comedy, with Shyamalan's trademarks of ""quirky characters and humor"" and ""tense, isolated fear"" playing perfectly within the confines of the film. I particularly admired a wonderful scene where the children play hide- and-seek together, only to be ambushed by their grandmother in a sequence that delivers both some genuinely startling gasps of shock before paying off an awkwardly amusing punchline that leaves the audience uneasy.There's also a lot to be said for the film's more emotional moments, mainly pertaining to the ""talking heads"" interviews Rebecca records with the characters for her documentary. It gives the film an organic way to really explore the depths of the emotional pathos everyone is feeling without having to rely on contrived dialog exchanges. And it's an example of the film's ""found footage"" style working to the story's advantage, while many other such ""found footage"" films arguably work against the story.I really can't help but hope now that between this film and the pretty-darned-good ""Wayward Pines"" (which M. Night produces) that Shyamalan is starting to re-claim his throne in the world of modern filmmaking. And it finally makes me excited again to watch for his new films and projects.I give ""The Visit"" a good 8 out of 10. It's got a lot of laughs. Some great spine-tingling moments. And is a welcome return to form for a director after a rough-patch. Here's to hoping for more great bits of fun like this from Shyamalan in the future!",The Visit
85,quincytheodore,The rustic escapade elevated by fine atmosphere and acting,7,1 May 2016,"Mockumentary or found footage is mostly tailored for realism, but they can also be seen as sloppy as the implementation of shaky cam is now widespread. ""The Visit"" fortunately brings a good visual and cinematography, it also has the luxury of identifiable situation as the premise and great acting performance to establish the eerie setup.This is a story about two young children who are visiting their grandparents who they have never seen before, which screams like a bad idea in general. They soon find that the seemingly polite and likable grandparents have creepy secrets. The movie employs better use of cinematic shots within the boundary of found footage, and it cleverly uses the young girl's film hobby as excuse for this.Both the old and young cast do a remarkable job on making friendly and approachable characters, even though they have hidden quirks. Becca and Tyler will most likely grow on audience with their antics. It's also not hard to root for them since they apparently have baggage to carry. A few of the interview moments are far better than expected from ordinary horror has to offer.The sense of dread comes from having to deal with the older couple who are constantly exhibiting strange behaviors. It makes for a couple of either bizarre or uncomfortable moments. This air of mystery is what keeps the tension going, and this is the example of the unknown is more effective than outright scare as at latter half it loses some of its effectiveness.For a found footage genre, ""The Visit"" is definitely a step above the rest with its smart visual, good acting and strangely gripping moments.",The Visit

It's a return to his light horror and small, contained story roots. The acting and script were good, and combined with the hand-held mockumentary conceit it felt very real. If you like Shayamalan movies and scary movies about crazy old people, give it a try.",The Visit
87,Screen_Blitz,"Not the best from M. Night Shyamalan, but surprisingly entertaining",6,8 January 2016,"For the past several years, M. Night Shyalaman has faced a bit of a downfall in his career. With his string of significantly abysmal films such as 'The Happening', 'The Last Airbender', and 'After Earth'; it was wonder whether we would this director would ever rise back to stardom he earned from his hit supernatural thriller 'The Sixth Sense' and his two films following it. This found footage thriller 'The Visit', doesn't quite bring his career back on track, but it sets a good start. This film follows the story of a young teen Becca, a girl who finds joy in documenting her life via video camera, with of being a documentarian (played by Olivia DeJonge), and her younger brother Tyler (played by Ed Oxenbould) who has a fascination in rapping. These two children are taken to their grandparents (played by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) to spend a nice week with them. Their grandfathers have grown a severely strained relationship with the children's mother (played by Kathryn Hahn) who walked out on them as a teenager. Over the week, the children witness some bizarre and uncanny behavior by their grandparents, which leads to them discovering a disturbing secret about them.Found footage has been held as one of the most tiring genres over the years, with a number of mediocre films. Then with a found footage thriller at the hands over M. Night Shyalaman, many would expect to see a major disaster of a movie (I know I did). Surprisingly, this film manages to succeed past my expectations. This movie is a found- footage horror flick with a mix of comedic elements that, while doesn't try to be particularly scary or nightmarish, manages to sum up some decent storytelling and a creepy atmosphere; and not in a laughable way like in 'The Happening'. The characters are very likable the second the film introduces, the two children are very charming and funny upon arrival, with Ed Oxenbould's character taking the spotlight with a cute little rap performance in few scenes here and there. Then there is Olivia DeJonge who is just an average teenage girl who dreams of making documentary films, as most of the film takes place via her video camera. The film has its funny moments as well as its creepy moments, which began when their seemly nice grandparents start exhibiting some unusual behavior, and these scenes are pretty creepy. So the film is not a straight-up horror, but more a comedy- horror. There are few jump scares along with this. However, the film is not scary in way that will leave a strong impact, and there is little denying that it is slow paced at times. Then there are also some dramatic moments, most of which are dictated by the concept of the grandparents and their strained relationship with the children's mother. This plays a big role in the story and with its touchy message about family, does convey an emotional tone at times. Overall, it works well with the story, even if it can get a little distracting to the plot. The Visit is not as scary as I was hoping it to be. There are a few ideas here that work, and then some that don't work too well. I believe M. Night Shyalaman could have done a little better, maybe with a better script; but all in all, this film doesn't fail too miserably. While this exactly be a comeback for Shyalaman, but it shows he has the potential of redeeming his career.",The Visit
88,blumdeluxe,A bad situation,6,23 July 2017,"""The Visit"" tells the story of two children who plan on visiting their grandparents, whom they never met before, to give their mother some private time with her new boyfriend. Soon after they arrive, things become increasingly frightening and they discover that something is terribly wrong in this house.The film fulfills its purpose and creates a scary atmosphere. As in many horror movies, the story is a bit over the top and not too realistic, which costs some credibility, specially when it comes to the illnesses of the elderly couple that seem to appear a bit too tailor made. The idea of having the girl record a documentary and the thus POV-style in some sequences are of course nothing new and thus not very innovative but they are included into the movie solidly and I didn't feel disturbed. In general, I like the plot and that makes up for a lot of potential that was wasted on the way by going for the shocking effect.All in all this is a solid horror movie, the term thriller is a bit of a false declaration in my eyes. It has some problems that many other horror movies face as well but also performs better than many of them. If you're a horror fan and the plot sounds appealing you pretty much get what you see and thus this could be a good choice for you.",The Visit

90,gedikreverdi,Don't hold onto anger,6,27 January 2021,The best thing about the movie was the kid actors. They did a great job and I immediately cared about them and Tyler was hilarious. The kids visited their grandparents for the very first time since their mother left her house for marrying an older man who's not approved by their parents at all. Becky was shooting a doc about this story and the two was walking around with their cams on videotaping everything. The hide and seek under the house was creepy as their grandmother joined and chased them. Tyler found out that grandpa is wearing diapers and keeping them in the shade. At night grandma was running inside the house fully naked and they said they must keep away from the basement as there's mold. Grandma wanting from Becky to clean the oven in the oven gave the vibes of Hansel and Gretel and at some point I thought it'd be a supernatural flick. Grandma accidentally damaged the camera of their laptop and they skyped with their mom her without seeing them. Kids complained to mom as the grandmother came to their door at night with a knife at her hand and wanted her to come pick them up and their mother saw her parents from the laptop cam and said they're not her parents. That was the twist of the movie that people hyped up. It turns out they were from a psychiatric hospital nearby where their real grandparents would volunteer and Becky found the body of her grandmother tucked in a box in the basement and the fake grandpa Locked him up in the bedroom where the fake granny was sleeping. Becky had to kill her as she attacked her. And downstairs the fake grandpa smeared his feces in his diaper all over Tyler's face and he was germaphobic. Tyler killed her with the fridge door and they went out as their mother arrived with the police. She said don't hold onto anger Becky and forgive your father who left us and it became a horror movie with a message. I didn't hate it nor was it boring but that climax that I expected never came and that left me a bit disappointed.,The Visit

93,RforFilm,Wait a minute. The Visit is a...good Shyamalan movie? Stop the presses!,7,14 September 2015,"I think for a lot of kids, one of their biggest fears is not being able to sleep in the same house as their parents. You could be staying with a grandparent you're your best friend, but your smart enough to know that while these people know you, your parents understand you better. I can't think of how many times that while I was staying with my grandparents, I'd wish my mom and dad would be home sooner from their vacation. The old fashioned home I was in wasn't scary, but the age of the place was intimidating. It was almost haunting-like.That's not to say my grandparents were bad people; I loved them in fact. Most kids live by routine and a departure from that can become frightening itself. People can outgrow this, but show me a kid whose never been intimidated by another surrounding and I'll show you a man whose never been afraid. One of my biggest questions I asked myself as I drifted into sleep in the guest room was, ""Did my grandparents feel this way when they first moved in?"". Two kids question their new surroundings from familiar people in The Visit. Young teens Rebecca (played by Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (played by Ed Oxenbould) are planning to stay for a week with their grandparents who've they've never met before. Their visit is the product of their single mother Paula (played by Kathryn Hahn) who has been estranged from her folks and doesn't want to open up why, even though she agrees to let the children visit them.Rebecca is an aspiring documentarian and has decided to record her upcoming visit by camera (The Visit is shot in a found footage style for this reason) while Tyler is an amateur rapper. The two take the train to the Pennsylvania countryside to have what is hopefully to be a fun and informative week.Their greeted by their grandpa ""papa"" John (played by Peter McRobbie) and grandma ""nana"" Doris (played by Deanna Dunagan) who live on an isolated farmhouse. At first, they seem to be loving and want to spoil the kids with games and unlimited treats from the kitchen. The only rule given is lights out at 9:30, as their old. The kids start to hear noises at night and notice strange behavior and mood swings through out the day. Though dismissed as dementia, the kids try to figure out what could be up with these people and whether their mothers past had anything to do it. As soon as I saw the name M. Night Shyamalan, I went in expecting another scary story that I can laugh at for being dumb and unfrightening. The Visit however may have broken Shyamalan's bad track and let me to declare that the movie is ""not that bad"" Yea, your probably in shock that this is actually a descent film, but this remains the first in my book that the director may finally be in on the joke. Though The Visit is a horror movie, this also happens to be a funny story, especially with the two kids who are pretty good actors, my favorites though have to be the grandparents who seem to carry a blanket of warmth and uneasiness. That's not easy for an elder to pull off, but I could see how I would have been fooled at around this age. This can unfortunately come off as a bit uneven in tone in various spots, but I think the film still works. The other factor I usually criticize Shyamalan for is his use of sudden twists, but I found it both scary and made sense the more I thought about it. The Visit heavily relies on how much one doesn't know.I'll give this seven sets of baked cookies out of five. This happens to be a good horror film for those that want a genuine scare without much of the blood and guts one would find in a typical slasher. The Visit is a nice return to form for Shyamalan.",The Visit
94,cultfilmfan,M. Night Shyamalan's The Visit,10,12 September 2015,"Much like last month's film, The Gift by Joel Edgerton, The Visit is another film this year that completely took me by surprise. It was a film that I did not even know about up until the last couple of weeks when I saw that it was to be released in mid September. It was another film that I had seen no trailers for, and knew absolutely nothing about the film. Closer to the release date, the film was gathering good reviews from most critics and I have to say that my curiosity was peaked. It had been a long time since I had seen a film by M. Night Shyamalan (the last one I was to see was Signs in 2002) and after Signs, he really did not have a critical, or box office hit for quite a long time. Well basically up till now. Every film he made after Signs, was almost always critically panned and proved to be box office poison. I did not watch any of those films because of the sometimes atrocious reviews they were receiving as well as when I went to see Signs, I strongly, strongly disliked it. I remember it was a film that I wish I could have gotten my money and time back for after I walked out of the theatre. That was 13 years ago, so perhaps if I gave it another watch now maybe I would think differently, but as it stands I am here to review The Visit, and that is what I will do. This is another film that falls into the category where the less you know about the film going into it, the more I think you will end up enjoying it in the end. The theatre I went to was mostly occupied by teenagers who were in their early teens. Usually seeing a film where the teenage audience screams, laughs and generally makes themselves very vocal during this type of film would probably bother me, but surprisingly this time around, I found it to be a good atmosphere for the film and kind of even further enhanced my enjoyment of the film. The Visit, is shot like a documentary film and thankfully for the most part there is none of those shaky camera shots that nauseated me for an entire day after I saw The Blair Witch Project on the big screen. The film is certainly one of the most unusual films I have ever seen, but I mean that in the best way possible. At times, The Visit blends comedy, horror and at times can even be very gross and childish, but at the same time I loved every minute of it. At times what you are seeing on the screen is so bizarre and out there that you want to laugh at the film because some of it seems almost pathetic in a B movie kind of way both with it's jokes as well as some of the scares and situations it conjures up, but everything here is so entertaining and technically well done that you can not help but have your eyes glued to the screen and be fascinated by it, while at the same time even being disgusted, disturbed, or in disbelief over the whole thing. The story and the way it works here is certainly the work of bent and undoubtedly a very creative mind. Shyamalan seems to be having a lot of fun with this film and it definitely shows and we as an audience are having a blast with the film as it goes along because regardless of whether you end up liking the film, or not, I think most people would definitely have to say this is one of the strangest films in recent memory for a mainstream release and will certainly stay in your memory for awhile to come regardless if you liked the film, or not. Shymalan has proved that he directs children and teenagers well. Look at Haley Joel Osment's Oscar nominated performance in The Sixth Sense. Again the two young leads in this film played by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould are terrific. They are smart characters, they are interesting characters and they play against type by actually doing everything right in this film that usually the young people in horror films don't do. They have wonderful personalities and some interesting character dissection of them is quite fascinating and at times moving regarding them as well. As for the adult actors in the film, I won't say too much as to give anything away, but just like the young performers here, they are also terrific. The film is certainly an offbeat one and is destined to become a cult classic in it's own right and rightly so. The film may seem a bit uneven at times, but I think it was all orchestrated that way perfectly and in it's own weird way it plays out beautifully. This is certainly the most fun and unique film experiences I have had at the theatre this year and The Visit will not be a film I will soon forget and I hope it gets Shyamalan back on the map as well as making stars out of these two terrific leading young actors. And again whether you like the film, or not, it will certainly leave an impression on you and one you won't soon forget which in it's own right is a pretty powerful aspect of a film. One of the year's best.",The Visit
95,Hollywood_Yoda,Shyamalan's Big Comeback,10,20 June 2017,"After the last few films made by M. Night Shyamalan were disappointing, The Visit seemed like it'd be another flop. However, The Visit was very good, up there with The Sixth Sense, a distant second. A very interesting story and very mysterious, it's true to Shyamalan's style.The camera work, which was more a ""found film"" style similar to The Blair Witch Project, was different than previous M. Night Shyamalan films, and fresh. Directed well, the actors actually do some of the camera handling, and the shots are from their point of view.You'd never expect the story to go in the direction it did! And I'm sure the children were terrified, as some scenes were terrifying. The actors playing the grandparents are scary and creepy, even before the end. The ending was a happy one.",The Visit
96,Vivekmaru45,Watching A Pair Of Douche-bag Kids For 1hr 30mins Is Not My Idea Of Fun.,3,28 September 2015,"I was expecting more from this film, but it's another let-down by writer-director M.K. Shyamalan.Though this guy has made some good films in the past like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, his latest left me in a state of utter disgust. The film is about a single-mom Paula(Kathryn Hahn) sending off her kids Rebecca(Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler(Ed Oxenbould) to her grandparents home while she goes on vacation. The kids want to record the trip for their mom, so the film is mostly recorded footage from their digicam. The kids chosen for this film do nothing to enhance the film - just your run-of-the-mill little brother and big sister. However the actors that play the grandparents are a bit better, and they produce all the scares in the movie. There is one scene in the film which Shyamalan has stolen from a Brothers Grim fairytale - I wont tell you which one. The setting for the film is some backwoods town in America, where people lead a less hectic lifestyle. The children are very eager to get along with their grandparents in the start of the film, but soon start to be suspicious about their strange behaviour. They are told not leave their bedroom after 9:30 p.m. and to never go near the basement because it contains toxic mold. This film has some pretty disturbing scenes, some of them can be considered perverse and not suitable for family viewing. The film lacks a good background music effects and special-effects are practically non-existent for this film. The overall script for the film is weak and should have been developed more by Shyamalan before he rashly decided that it was time for it to be made into a film.Verdict: a very passable film and I would never care to sit through this one again.",The Visit
97,swilliky,A terrifying return to thrillers for Shyamalan,7,23 January 2017,"M. Night Shyamalan returned to the thriller genre with a limited budget but a clever idea.

Their mom (Kathryn Hahn) has not seen their grandparents in years and still refuses to go with them. They go out to a visit an isolated house where Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie).

98,bryank-04844,". If I were a younger kid, watching this movie, I would NEVER EVER want to visit my grandparents again.",8,9 September 2015,"Finally, we have M. Night Shyamlan back in rare form with his new horror-comedy film 'The Visit', which definitely doesn't look like a Shyamalan movie at all. In fact, this is one of those ""found footage"" movies that rejuvenates this sub-genre of filmmaking once again. The world was introduced to M. Night Shyamalan back in 1999 with his hit film 'The Sixth Sense', which quickly led the young director to super-stardom as one of the coolest and imaginative directors of this modern era. Not only that, but he re-invented the ""twist ending"" again, which became a trademark of his down the road.He followed up 'The Sixth Sense' with 'Unbreakable' (one of the most underrated movies of all time), followed by the alien invasion film 'Signs'. After that those three movies, it seemed that Shyamalan took a turn in his filmmaking that had audiences and critics alike slamming his movies, one after the other. Even though I enjoyed the hell out of 'The Village', I know many others didn't. Then after that, there was a string of films that most critics and audiences consider some of the worst movies ever made.Even with Shyamalan's last film 'After Earth', the studio never marketed his name to the movie, in fear that people wouldn't go see it, given his track record. This was strange, because studios used to bill his name to drive audiences in, not the other way around. That all being said, I'm happy to announce that this M. Night Shyamalan film is a great welcome back for the estranged director and a great step towards greatness again, even though the film doesn't have the trademark Shyamalan look to it. Made up of a cast with almost no recognized actors, minus Kathryn Hahn, and filmed on a $5 million dollar budget, this new mix of horror and comedy called 'The Visit' is well worth your time and equally packs a good amount of scares as well as laughs.'The Visit' follows brother and sister Rebecca and Tyler (Olivia De Jonge and Ed Oxenbould respectively), who are early teenagers, living with their single mother Paula (Hahn). Witty, oddly intelligent, and hilariously fun, these kids are making a documentary of their life and adventures to show their mother and her troubled past. In order to allow their mom some much needed vacation time with her new boyfriend, the kids are going to stay with their grandparents for the week, whom they have never met, nor has their mother seen them since she was 19 after a bad falling out. Rebecca and Tyler take the train to visit their grandparents on their farm in their small town, documenting every little thing, even Tyler's hilarious freestyle raps.They meet their grandparents Doris and John (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) with open arms and all seems happy for the time being. But, it's not far off that Rebecca and Tyler begin to notice very strange and creepy things going on after lights out with their grandparents, and it only gets worse with each night passing. Shyamalan wrote the script here, but i'm not sure how much of it was improv or written, but whatever the case might be, he has shown once again that he can be a master of horror. There are so many creepy and down right scary moments that you'll be on the edge of your seat gasping for a breath.Equally though too, you'll laugh as much as you're scared, even if some of the laughter is of the nervous kind. Shyamalan and his actors take you on this ride, full force, never giving in, and never allowing you to guess the twist, which of course there is one, and it's remarkable. The ""found footage"" aspect is brilliant up to a certain point, where I think it could have gone into a full narrative look and been just as good if not better, because there were some odd mistakes and weird camera movements.Other than a couple of unexplained plot holes, 'The Visit' does exactly what it aims to do, which is to scare you completely and make you laugh throughout. I never knew Shyamlan had it in him to make me laugh, but he sure does, thanks to the brilliant young actor Ed Oxenbold. Deanna Dunagan also shines here in her role as the grandmother, who will make you feel right at home, but in a split second, make you too scared to come out of your room. There is also a bit of heart and soul to this picture as there is with most of Shyamalan's work, which was nice to see. M. Night Shyamalan is back and I hope it stays this way. If I were a younger kid, watching this movie, I would NEVER EVER want to visit my grandparents again. I can't wait to see it again.Highly Recommended!",The Visit

This is a superb modern horror that is actually different to many offerings these days. It is a genuinely creepy story and for once I watched a horror film with an actual sense of dread rather than apathy. It's well filmed and has characters you actually care about. The two children played by Olivia Delonge and Ed Oxenbould do a great job but the real star of the show for me was Deanna Dunagan as Nana, a truly frightening character. I thought the film was very clever and I'm not sure why there is so much hate for this film as it really is a cut above most modern horrors. Maybe it's the fact it's more psychological than gory but it's undeniably scary. The ending is maybe a little bit of a letdown but it's so good beforehand that it doesn't really matter. M.

103,CANpatbuck3664,"Cool Concept, Mixed Results",6,24 January 2016,"It's the movies that go down the middle that can be the hardest to talk about. When a movie is awesome or just terrible, a lot of stuff springs to mind really quickly. When a movie is kinda mediocre, you struggle to separate the positives from the negatives and it all kinda blends together in a pile. Luckily, even though I gave this movie a 6, there is stuff to talk about and even though this movie didn't completely work for me, it's still a step up for M. Night. But considering his recent output, take that with a grain of salt.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Paula (Kathryn Hahn) is a single mom who has 2 kids, Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould). Rebecca is a teenage aspiring filmmaker and Tyler is a wannabe rapper who Rebecca describes as ""ethnically confused."" Paula works hard and gets very little for herself so the kids want her to spend some time with her new boyfriend Miguel. So she goes on a cruise with Miguel, while her estranged parents John (Peter McRobbie) and Doris (Deanna Dunagan) are going to look after the Rebecca and Tyler for the week. There is some tension with this decision as Paula has had little to no contact with her parents since her teenage years after she moved out with her boyfriend when she was pregnant. But the kids genuinely want their mom to have some time for herself so they board a train and head off to their grandparents.I don't want to go into the plot more to avoid spoiling things, so I think the strength of this movie is that the story/concept is interesting. When you're a kid, being handed over to strangers for an extended period of time is pretty scary, you ease into it of course but initially it can be pretty frightening. This movie plays into those fears well, I can tell you if I had been left with these people, I would not have been so calm and willing to roll with the punches as these kids were. I found it to be intriguing that they found a fairly unique way to tap into a natural fear instead of manufacturing a ghost or a demon from another realm.Another positive is that the acting is largely good. Peter and Deanna are pretty creepy respectively, they really put a lot into their performances, they display some physicality even. Now Olivia and Ed are also solid, their characters themselves are annoying, Ed's rapping is pretty bad and Rebecca doesn't talk like a teenager (her dialogue is obviously written by someone who's older and didn't know how to bring it down to a teenage level) but their performances are good. Kathryn Hahn is also sound in the small amount of screen time she gets. She's an underrated actress and she continues to deliver in the small parts she gets.I'll get into the stuff that didn't work for me. The found footage movie has been done many times over and while I didn't find this one to be especially bad, it certainly didn't add anything new. It didn't have to be found footage and while it being that way was part of the plot, it just felt like a way to keep the movie's budget down as opposed to being an important stylistic choice.As much as I thought the central premise was cool, a lot of the plot relies on coincidence and contrivance. Somehow whenever someone comes to the house, the grandparents are never there. Whenever the grandparents do something crazy, the excuse is they're old (rarely is there a further explanation and when there is, its dropped and barely addressed at all later). Their mom can't see them during their Skype conversations because there's batter on the camera. Paula gives the kids so few details about their grandparents' temperament or their appearance. I understand every movie has that to some degree but it stood out to me here.The film itself wasn't very scary but I did get some laughs (intentional laughs) and toward the end the tension did ramp up. This is another divisive movie, looking at other reviews you either really enjoy it or you hate it with a passion. It's closer to a 6.5/10 for me but since it is technically a horror movie and I wasn't very scared I'll go with a 6/10.",The Visit
104,dfa120374,Devil & Unbreakable Standards This Is Not,4,14 March 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan movies can be very much hit-n-miss, and unfortunately The Visit is a bit of a miss, although it doesn't miss by much and at least it was better than snorefests like The Village and The Happening. If it had a wee bit more happening (no pun intended) through the 2nd Act instead of scenes just cutting off when they were getting interesting, it might have been better. This just ruined the flow for me because it was stop/start too many times, and because of this the tension ended up lacking too.I've read reviews where the viewer complained about it being shot documentary style, but I didn't actually mind that it was filmed this way. Would it have been a better film if it was shot like a more regular film? Very debatable because it was explained as to WHY the film was shot this way, so I doubt not having this aspect in the story would have made it better.Like I say, though, that didn't bother me. What got me was the slow pace and the continual stop/start moments, which is actually a bit of a trait with Shyamalan's movies (ones he's directed at least) along with relying on a shock/twist ending to make them better. The Sixth Sense, The Village, The Happening - all slow paced movies that rely on the ending to make them better than what they were. Well, the Sixth Sense was a decent enough overall, but take away the ending and it ends up being a below average film. The Visit is along the same lines. There are some good tense scenes scattered throughout (just enough to keep you watching), but just too few & far between.I have to give a quick mention to the performances of the main cast too. Deanna Dunagan & Peter McRobbie who played Nana & Pop Pop respectively stole the show in my opinion. The way they turned from sweet-natured grandparents to, well, something else was enjoyable to watch.Overall The Visit wasn't that bad, but it's just a pity it was nowhere near the standard of Devil or Unbreakable.",The Visit
105,SquigglyCrunch,A Horror-Comedy that Fails to be Funny or Scary,2,21 April 2016,"The Visit follows two children who go to visit their grandparents for a week after not seeing them for their entire lives, and their grandparents turn out to be...different.The plot is okay. Sure, maybe it's kind of unique (simply because it's about old people instead of little girls), but in terms of presentation it's very much the opposite. Everything about the movie is very poorly written until the very end, when it releases an incredible twist ending that almost redeems the rest of the movie and makes it make sense. However there's no real build up. Sure, there's foreshadowing, but I never sat there and thought ""I wonder if there's more to this..."" I think that I'd enjoy it more if I watched it again, knowing the ending now, but the thing is that I don't want to, mostly because everything else is kind of terrible. The characters are incredibly flat. They have a handful of defining traits, but they never really go that deep. Sure, the movie tries to force back story and stuff on us, but that doesn't tell us that much about the characters. It tells us how they feel about one particular topic, and it doesn't reflect in their lives or affect how they act. Speaking of acting, these guys are all pretty incompetent. I guess they aren't horrible, but they're still pretty bad. There were a handful of scenes, specifically the rap scenes, that really bothered me. The kid who raps is horrible, and it's not even funny. I had to cover my eyes and try not to listen when these scenes came on, they just made me cringe so much, and not in a good way. Apparently this movie is a horror-comedy, but it's never scary really. Towards the end maybe there's a bit of suspense, but otherwise there wasn't really anything scary. All the parts that could have been considered 'horror' were all spoiled in the trailer, so it turned out just to be predictable. The comedy aspect was worse. There was not a single part of this movie that was funny. I could tell that M. Night 'tried', but the 'effort' he put in just wasn't even remotely funny. Lot's of scenes that were supposed to be scary clearly existed for the sake of the trailer, which made them even less scary and more forced for the sake of 'scaring' people in the trailer.Overall The Visit was just unpleasant. The characters were terrible, the acting was mediocre, the horror wasn't horrifying, and the comedy wasn't comedic. The ending was great, and I think that it'd be better if I watched it again, but with everything else stacked against it I don't think that I would want to. Ever. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless your a die hard fan of M. Night Shyamalan.",The Visit
106,AvionPrince16,Psychological point and twist: art of shyamalan,7,19 August 2021,"So this movie mixed comedy and horror. It can be pretty bad or pretty good, for this movie it was pretty good. I enjoyed it, a little bit short but well made. It have some scary and creepy dialogue and scenes. I really enjoyed the movie. We have also an other parallel story, a psychological story between the brother and the sister. It was good until the twist spice up thing s and make us wonder what will happen at the end of the movie. Very good movie.",The Visit
107,billygoat1071,Shyamalan's Self-Awareness,8,23 November 2015,"The past years after Signs or The Village or something haven't been kind to director M. Night Shyamalan. He keeps ending up making horror films with the same formula, silly twists and other nonsense. Now, it seems like Shyamalan has seen what most audience think of him and thus here's The Visit. Which seems to be a found-footage film gone wrong (I mean seriously, the illusion of this technique is almost nonexistent,) the movie centers two kids meeting their estranged grandparents which seems to have a dark secret from their odd behavior. And in case the trailers of this movie have fooled you to expect a total horror film, The Visit is actually Shyamalan's way of making the audience laugh with him and not at him, by poking fun of his own tropes, however manages to bring some inspired horror elements. But the punchline is the main spotlight here, which makes it a rather fun film.This might be an example if the director made another bad horror movie and did it at the worst ways possible. Firstly the technique, it's not very convincing. The camera is too steady, it shoots pretty angles, even when the characters aren't aware of it, it has transition effects of random exteriors that no one has any idea who filmed them, and the camera is way too high definition for an amateur footage. Though maybe it made sense to the fact that the protagonist is an aspiring filmmaker. Anyway, also like most found-footage movies, it keeps breaking the rule of casting familiar faces, when this technique is supposed to represent totally realistic that even the cast should be played by lesser known actors. But even good found footage movies don't seem to care about the rules anymore, either, which now makes it totally pointless. Now the story itself takes place in the same absurd universe of any bad Shyamalan movie. For the antagonist, the secret behind their behavior is extreme nonsense, but in a delightful way. It shows a silly paranoia about old people's dementia. It is kind of stupid, though the twist, while simple, does seem worth the surprise and it gets really darker afterwards.There are still moments that tries to be scary, some may work while others are basically for the sake of shock value, that specifically happens at the climax where things really go crazy. It may be ridiculous, but their threat is still quite effective. Then again, what really triumphs is what a kind of a joke it is trying to be. There are also humor that doesn't involve the scary old people, like how pretentious Becca sometimes is as a filmmaker and the fact that the little brother is basically meant to be a comic relief. There's also a running joke about random people they come across while recording suddenly make monologues out of nowhere. It's priceless enough to fill in to an already ludicrous environment. Back to its craft, despite of my complains about how anti-found-footage this found-footage, the movie still looks nice. It shoots the terror well, even when it pushes the aesthetics a little too far.The acting is quite solid for a modern Shyamalan movie. Olivia DeJonge carries the film well as the aspiring documentary filmmaker and she has some genuinely strong moments, thought it's the young Ed Oxenbould who steals the show; again, he is supposed to be the comic relief who replace swear words with pop singer names (well, not always) and make rap music, but he doesn't go too broad and manages to be as relatable as the protagonist. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie seem to be having the time of their lives as the crazy grandparents.The Visit won't work for you if you're seeking for a straight up horror film. Sure, there are moments that works as a horror film, but it's not without acknowledging what a funny movie this also is. So the real question is, is this really the comeback of the Shyamalan we used like? Not much. It's too stupid to be akin to The Sixth Sense, but also too self-aware to be akin to (insert Shyamalan movie after Unbreakable.) It's basically it's own personality, to be honest. It's weird and somewhat creepy, but as the story goes, it keeps getting delightful. That's the main pleasure you may find in The Visit, embracing the strangeness and its amount of ridicule.",The Visit
108,DareDevilKid,"Slow-Burning, Seat-Squirming, Genuinely Scary, and Unimaginably Witty",9,28 September 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.1/5 stars""The Visit"" provides horror fans with a satisfying blend of thrills and laughs while signaling a welcome return to form for Writer- Director M. Night Shyamalan. It's the terrifying story of a brother and sister who are sent to their estranged grandparents' remote Pennsylvania farm for a weeklong trip. Once the children discover that the elderly couple is involved in something deeply disturbing, they see their chances of getting back home are growing smaller every day.After several perplexing misfires right after the spellbinding cinematic experience that ""The Sixth Sense"" was, Shyamalan has scaled back, gone for a lower budget and a lighter tone, and emerged with his most captivating movie in over a decade and a half. Paying homage to dark fairy tales and isolated-cabin horror, it's been a while since we've had Shyamalan that's as sharp as this. Essentially a horror-comedy at its core – ""The Visit"" has it all; from rap battles to a fair helping of freaky stuff to WTF-type moments to jump-scare scenes to tension that will truly unnerve you. The buildup to the nerve-wracking suspense until the jaw-dropping denouement proves that Shyamalan still has more than a few tricks up his sleeve.With ""The Visit"", M. Night has crafted a horror movie full of high- quality jolts, spooks, unpredictability, and some really good laughs. It's a film you just can't miss – one of the best horror movies of the year. Moreover, it isn't something you would expect going into the film – it's not always you see a comeback as spectacular as this. Consider this finely honed and funny creep-fest a rip-roaring comeback for M. Night Shyamalan.",The Visit
109,MattBrady099,Better than After Earth,5,28 September 2015,"Can M. Night Shamalamadingdong return to he's old roots?...almost.The story is about a harried single mother leaves her two young children with her grandparents for the weekend. But when they get back, things seem different - and so very wrong.What happened to M. Night Shyamalan? That's the biggest question that everyone on the world wide web tried to answer, but we never got a clear answer. I mean seriously, how can you start off so high with success like: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs, then suddenly out of nowhere fall straight flat on your face with non- stop sh*t like: After Earth, Lady in the Water, Last Airbender and The Happening. And it went on from there as every time M. Night release a new film it always turns out bad and pretty much everyone as just given up on the fact that he can make a good movie again. Shyamalan is now an easy target for criticism and if Shyamalan did make a good movie everyone will just hate it anywhere just because... it's Shyamalan. Now we've got he's new film called ""The Visit"" and I can safely say that this movie wasn't terrible at all, but I can't sit here acting like it's the greatest thing ever made just because Shyamalan finally made a movie that wasn't the worse thing on the planet like he's other ones. At least it was better than After Earth. First the positives: Ed Oxenbould and Olivia DeJonge (the two kid actors) did a great job nailing American accents, because both of them are Australian. But their acting in the movie was alright, I mean they did the best their could with the material that was given to them and they did good.I'm happy that M. Night finally went back to the low budget type of movies, because he seriously can't do big budge movies since there's many possibilities for him to f**k up. When you got a small budget, small crew and a small movie, it's hard to make huge mistakes. And yes there are mistakes in this movie but it wasn't as bad or just embarrassing as M. nights previous films. The movie did have some creepy moments that worked and wasn't terrible like I thought it was going to be. I'm actually surprised that Shyamalan made a movie like this that wasn't the Last Airbender or After Earth. The Visit had elements of being a great horror film, but sadly that's when the problems I have for the movie came in. For the problems: This entire movie is marketed as a horror comedy, so basically all the scenes in the film that was suppose to be funny just came off embarrassing. The movie would have been funny if the film was meant to be taken seriously like M. Night last films, which was funny. I think the comedy would have been right there, I mean Shyamalan wants us to be scared and also laugh since this is a ""horror comedy"", and too be honest the horror elements in this movie worked more than the comedy itself. I think you've got to be a true genius to blend the perfect humor and horror together to make it work. The writing was a bit meh, some of the jokes that the two kids said got stale after awhile and if you want a ""it's so bad that it's good"" type of movie I would honestly look somewhere as this doesn't land on any of those categories.Overall The Visit was surprisingly not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's not a great movie but at least it's better than he's other films that we had from him recently.",The Visit
110,ArchonCinemaReviews,Did we watch the same movie? The same garbage M. Night has been producing for years,2,29 October 2015,"M. Night Shyamalan has fallen quite a ways since his hey days of Signs and The Sixth Sense. Audience members prepare for his token 'twist' and they just keep getting more outlandish. This year's The Visit pares down the story and film back to the basics, and still we can't help but think his film is still just inadequate and inferior.Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and younger Tyler's (Ed Oxenbould) mom is in need of some serious R&R. So they take it upon themselves to take their grandparents up on an offer to stay with them for a week so mom can have some quality time with her new boyfriend, especially after the sudden and painful divorce. Never having met the grandparents, since their mother is estranged from her parents, they embark on an adventure to Pennsylvania farm country. At first Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) are welcoming and loving, all seems well, but then they start noticing odd tendencies about the elder couple and start to think this isn't what they had planned.People keep claiming that The Visit is the redemption film for M. Night Shyamalan after such travesties as The Happening or The Last Airbender. Having never seen the latter, I wasn't all that disappointed in the former. The problem with his films is they try so hard to be grand, rather than actually being an extraordinary concept. It shows in his ever decreasing popularity, and The Visit is no exception.Once again we have an M. Night Shyamalan film with a twist, which, if you perceive that as a spoiler then you are bonkers because every one of his films have a twist. The acting is poor, resting on the shoulders of two child actors who are not quite up to the task. Their personas and the family dynamic with the mother (Kathryn Hahn) is not one we typically see in film, but it is there, and M. Night's ability to bring it to life is lesser than his predecessors. The only good actress in the film was Deanna Dunagan as the batty Nana, but that is not enough to save the film overall.In all honesty, I wanted to stop watching after five minutes. The painful exposition, the trendy use of faux documentary cam footage in a horror film, and the bland characters – it was obvious this was not going to be good, let alone great. But, I persisted, and unfortunately that time invested didn't pay off. With no scares and very little story to build constant tension to give the illusion of fear, we were dreadfully disappointed once again.Please check out our website for FULL reviews of all the recent horror films.",The Visit
111,chicagopoetry,More Crap From The Crap Master,2,24 September 2015,"M. Night Sham is back and as lousy as ever. Presenting the one director most famous for living his career in reverse. His great masterpiece was his first movie and it has been nothing but downhill from there. Each film gets worse and worse. And believe it or not, in an attempt to make a big comeback, he resorts to the found footage genre, the cheapest, sleaziest and laziest genre in existence today (sometimes I wish Blair Witch Project was never made so I didn't have to suffer through one of these lousy movies after another). This film might have been something where we saw some promise if it was some director's first attempt, but it's not, it's freaking' M. Night Sham's umpteenth freaking' film and so it's a pile of garbage. The big surprise twist is obvious from about twenty minutes into the film and from then on it's just another stupid found footage film. This could have been a pretty scary film if it WASN'T in the found footage genre. The found footage concept detracts from everything as we wonder, who is still filming? why is the camera still filming? how convenient that the camera fell to the ground and is still filming at such a great angle. Blah blah freaking' blah blah blah like EVERY other found footage film ever made. Too lazy to actually make a film, well then, resort to found footage. The crappy cinematography can be blamed on the concept. Yeah, M. Night Sham is back alright, back to the same old crapola.",The Visit
112,nitzanhavoc,Shyamalan's reinvention of his style is simply superb,9,13 February 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan had first become known to me as the master of combining Horror with Psycho-Thriller and Suspense. Like many other viewers, I had completely knocked down by the twist towards the ending of The Sixth Sense, and was later extremely impressed with his ability to create an ending twist almost as exquisite in The Unbreakable. The Visit's style resembles these excellent features only remotely, but is altogether terrifying, eerie and unpleasant in a surprisingly innovating manner, proving how great M. Night is when he sticks to his specialty.While being a devout Horror fan for many years now, I really dislike ""found footage"" mockumentaries. I find them to be tiresome, boring, annoying and lacking the fear inducing elements for which the Horror genre calls. Not since The Blair Witch had I been so marvelously impressed and taken aback by a film from this sub-genre, and The Visit is simply better (and for me that's really saying something).Seeing as how a synopsis is available to all, there's no need to bother describing the plot, so let me skip forward and say that the plot twist is not more than ""nice"". Unlike M. Night's previous hits, the plot twist in The Visit is as predictable as can be, at least in my opinion as a somewhat experienced Horror viewer. The hints obvious, making the conclusion quite hard to miss. However, contrary to what might be thought, this only serves to show how great this film really is. In The Sixth Sense and The Unbreakable, the plot twist was the greatest feature of the film, connecting all the dots of previous scenes and making a regular story absolutely spectacular. In The Visit, the plot twist is mediocre at best, which only emphasizes how amazing the film is regardless.The script, like the twist, is average, and the soundtrack and cinematography offer nothing new to anyone who's seen a ""found footage"" mockumentary before. However, The Visit offers some of the finest most professional acting I've seen in a long while. Deanna Dunagan is simply bursting with talent playing the role of Nana, delivering an impeccable performance in each and every one of her scenes! Whether it calls for her to be motherly and loving or sick and disturbing, Dunagan is a true artist, a master (mistress?) in the field. Peter McRobbie demonstrates similar expertise in the role of Pop Pop, is no match to Dunagan's screen presence, charisma and sheer talent. I would very much like to see him in other Horror features, so I can give him a more objective review, since in The Visit it's impossible to avoid comparing him to Dunagan, a comparison that has no way of turning up in his favour. Olivia DeJonge (Becca) is gorgeous, and Ed Oxenbould (Tyler) is cute... That's all I find myself able to say after seeing them next to Dunagan and McRobbie.Without giving any spoilers, certain scenes in the film called for the actors to play the roles of insane mental patients. Having had some experience with this particular population, I must say I have NEVER seen the role played so accurately, authentically and realistically. Absolutely no Hollywood over-dramatization in Dunagan's acting, and only a small bit in McRobbie's. I wouldn't be surprised if M. Night had them visit an asylum to observe and get acquainted with the inhabitants, or watch recorded sessions and interviews, or both.All in all, The Visit is absolutely terrifying which is just what us Horror fans want in a film. I counted maybe two cheap jump-scares (that were a lot less cheaper than in most films), and virtually no use of Hollywood cheats. All I can say is I applaud the entire cast and supporting crew, and mainly Shyamalan, for proving to us all he doesn't need a perfect plot twist to make an almost perfect Horror film. This is a must see, you won't regret it!",The Visit
113,romanorum1,Flawed Found-Footage Flick,4,9 November 2018,"Two young teenagers, digital camera filmmaker Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her rapper brother, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) travel to spend a week with their mother's parents, Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter Mc Robbie), at their remote rural Pennsylvania farm. In daylight the grandparents seem normal enough, with grandma cooking up a storm and grandpa doing his farming chores. But within a short time, the teens begin to realize that there are odd occurrences. Pop Pop has instructed the kids not to enter the basement or leave their bedrooms after 9:30 PM. Why does Nana have a penchant for nocturnal rages? What is Pop Pop doing in the woodshed? And why does Nana want Becca to crawl all the way inside the kitchen oven in order to clean it? It is all explained that the grandparents are old people who have strange ways.One has to wonder what the kids' mother (Kathryn Hahn) was thinking as she has not seen her parents since she was 19 years old because they apparently disapproved of her boyfriend, later the kids' long-gone father. She has recently reconnected with them, but not in person. But if she is so caring, why does she really let her kids go off on their own to the house of total strangers (to them)? Meanwhile she is more interested in the ""hairy chest"" competition on her cruise with her boyfriend when the kids are gone.Becca, who carries around a camera so that we see much of the movie through her eyes, is making a documentary about their trip (to share with mom later). Tyler also uses the camera. So there are some off-center framing and wobbly hand-holding camera scenes. And there is also the software application known as Skype, where one can speak to one another over the internet and also see them via webcam. In the end, what the viewer sees is Becca's final editing of her ""documentary.""SPOILER AND CRITIQUE: The director likes using twists in his movies, and ""The Visit"" is no exception. About three-quarters of the way through the film, Becca and Tyler discover that the grandparents they are visiting are not really their grandparents. Nana and Pop Pop are escaped mental patients who murdered their real grandparents (who were counselors at a sanitarium) and have taken over their lives. And now they want to murder Becca and Tyler for some unknown motives. The twist is flawed, however, for three reasons.First, a concerned coworker from the sanitarium visits the house to check on the real grandparents, who obviously are missing from work. The fake grandparents manage to dodge the coworker, who speaks only to the kids. But it must also be obvious that the two escaped mental patients have been missed from the place. Does someone not realize that something is amiss? And how were the escaped patients so cognizant as to arrive at the counselors' homestead?Second, the fact that Becca and Tyler don't recognize that the impostors are not their grandparents is supposedly explained by the fact that the kids have never met them before. But remember that Skype plays an important role in this story. The teens use Skype with their mom while she is on her cruise. Nana ""accidentally"" damaged the camera on Becca's laptop, so Mom can't see the fakers. Nevertheless, it is inconceivable that there was never a Skype call with the kids, their ""grandparents,"" and the mother all together. The real grandparents were internet literate as the hardwired network in the house is still operational for the teens.Third, although the kids are chased by murderers, they still carry the camera. In a life threatening situation, one would expect victims to drop their gadgets as they run for their lives!The acting is generally fine, but the teens are often annoying, and Tyler's rap scenes are terrible. Overall the film misses as much as it hits. M. Night Shyamalan had his peak with ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) but has not lived up to his high expectations. He still keeps trying though.",The Visit
114,LloydBayer,The Visit is not the best in Shyamalan's resume but it could well be the end of his losing streak.,6,25 September 2015,"Following a spate of hits and misses, with mostly misses over the last decade, director M. Night Shyamalan seems to have broken free from the disastrous spell he was under. Although his latest offering - The Visit – doesn't reinvent the horror genre, it is still a well-executed film with a Shyamalan first – effectively creepy when it has to be, yet outrageously hilarious when you least expect it. The concept, however, isn't new and at first glance the found footage theme might throw some viewers off. Having personally hated The Blair Witch Project (the mother of all found footage horror films), I wasn't too thrilled going in for this but as it turns out, The Visit is best viewed as a mockumentary. This is the first notable aspect of the film, and owing to its satirical nature, draws you in with wacky humor from kids playing the lead. Visiting their grandparents for the first time, Becca and Tyler make a documentary getting to know them. Their grandparents, who they call Nana and Pop-pop, are regular old folks, but only during the day. After sundown things get pretty bizarre and downright creepy until Shyamalan's signature 'twist ending' reveals all. It's not the most original reveal and the resultant tonal shift is a bit of a letdown. But up to this point, the narrative is well balanced between wit, mystery, and a foreboding atmosphere that something is not quite right. Despite setbacks with his previous films, Shyamalan proves that he's still a visionary filmmaker with this respectable attempt at making a comeback. Pacing is deliberate with the narrative making good use of its 94 minute run time and doesn't feel stretched. Each day with the grandparents are title cards marked by a day of the week. While this looks like amateur film making for a kid, the technique has an ulterior motive, and this becomes apparent when we know how many days the kids have with their grandparents. Similarly, there are other bits and pieces of his genius at work, most notably, his incisive way of working with child actors. Playing the younger brother Tyler, Ed Oxenbould is an instant crowd pleaser while almost single-handedly delivering most of the humor. At times this also works as a smoke-screen between spring-loaded suspense and a few jump scares in the beginning. Although this might seem borrowed from the Paranormal Activity films, deft camera work more than makes up for some of the cheap scares. And while there are few scenes that tread dangerously close to bad taste, WTF moments juxtaposed between suspense driven tension and witty commentary keeps the story grounded. For an independent film on a shoestring budget, The Visit doesn't boast any fancy visual effects either. But you do get a good story that is deceptively simple and almost expertly told, in addition to good delivery from the actors, skin crawling sound design and crafty camera-work. For Shyamalan, this is a welcome return to form and hopefully, the end of his losing streak.",The Visit
115,skybrick736,The Visit (7/10),7,10 July 2016,"Shot in found footage style, the viewers are presented with two ridiculous characters of Becca, a teenage documentary wannabee and Tyler, a punk white boy rapper. From there the plot only gets weirder as the grandparents they visit are eccentric, almost demonic entities that progressively terrorize the kids. The Visit is something unlike M. Night Shyamalan has ever wrote or directed before with a quick pace, jump scares and lighter tone. It's however a really nice comeback for Shyamalan who strayed off from his thriller/horror roots and was making lackluster bigger budget films. There's a particular unsettling nature about the film with the grandparents acting the way they do considering their old age. It's an interesting concept that could have been pulled off a bit better with maybe a more serious tone and a better ending.",The Visit
116,dcarsonhagy,Granny's Afoot,1,1 May 2016,"It absolutely makes my head ache to think ANYBODY thought this movie was decent, much less good. ""The Visit"" is M. Night Shyamalan's latest attempt at striking gold once more. He did it in ""The Sixth Sense,"" but every one of his attempts after that have been laughable at best. This one is no exception.Two kids decide to visit their grandparents for the first time in their lives. Seems their mother ran away from home when she was 19 and has not spoken to either of her parents since then. So, what would be a good idea? I know: let's send my children to visit their grandparents-- whom they've NEVER seen--without as much as a picture of them to go by so they'll know they are not being picked up at the train station by psychos.If you cannot figure out what is going on as soon as they get to ""grandma's house,"" then you must be brain dead. ""Scary, good jumps, and thrills""--my ass. This is about as ridiculous as it gets--worse than ""The Village"".Rated PG-13 for old people nudity, language, and (minimal) violence, this is the sole reason I NEVER visit relatives.",The Visit
117,kdnor2011,I was laughing and screaming...sometimes at the same time,8,26 October 2015,"After two big budget action movies that bombed with critics and didn't make too much of a profit, M. Night Shyamalan took the money he made from directing Will Smith's After Earth in order to make the Visit. Produced on the cheap, the film is his best film in a while. I am a huge fan, I have even liked some of his more hated movies like The Happening and The Village. However The Visit works much better and has a lot of charm to it.Despite what the previews may have made it seem, this is not a straight horror film. In fact I wouldn't call this a horror film at all, this is a thriller-comedy. And it works on both levels. As a comedy, I laughed quite a lot during this. It may not be the most ""gut-busting"" humor ever written, but a lot of it did make me chuckle, and there were a descent amount of big laughs. As a thriller, it also is some great stuff. It has a build up that lures you into a false sense of security, thinking that the grandparents are just a little weird, but every day they get just a little more strange. There are a few good jump scares, in fact one made me scream in a way I haven't since at least The Conjuring a couple years ago. But what the movie does best is build up an uncomfortable atmosphere. And this not only makes it more thrilling, but makes some of the funny moments a little more nerve racking. More than once watching the movie was I laughing but also breathing heavily from fear. Besides the thrills and laughs, the film also has a good story and characters. I liked watching these two kids (don't take that out of context.) They were funny, they were likable, they were entertaining. And both of them were portrayed very well by the two young actors. The grandparents also were fun, when they weren't creepy. The found footage is used well here, allowing for a more claustrophobic atmosphere that would not have been done as well if it were shot traditionally. It also is beautiful to look at sometimes, allowing for some great shots of the sky and scenery. The twist ending made me actually jump and was one of those times where I was both laughing and shaking at the same time. And finally, the ending was actually pretty sweet. There are a few times that the music comes out of nowhere, which I guess was the point, but it felt a little jarring, especially at the end when it's supposed to be this really big moment and it just starts blaring. The video and audio quality are also way too nice for two teenagers filming with standard cameras you could buy at a store, so it does take some suspension of disbelief. And also there was this part that felt tacked on. Early on, Rebecca says that Tyler has a fear of germs, but then it isn't brought up again until an hour later. And between that time he's climbing under the house and lifting water out of an old well. Which was a little odd for a kid with such a fear.However I had a blast with The Visit. While I like the Happening, and actually don't mind movies like The Last Airbender and Lady in the Water, this is what I love him doing. It has a nice blend of comedy and thrills. It creates a likable cast. The acting is good. And it uses the found footage gimmick well while still being nice to look at.",The Visit
118,ericrnolan,"""The Visit"" is a damn creepy modern fairy tale.",8,27 September 2015,"I quite liked M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Visit"" (2015); I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It is by no means a perfect movie. But it has all of the elements of Shyamalan's work that I love: it's beautifully shot; it has a fresh, creative story; it's suspenseful; it's atmospheric, and it has well drawn, likable protagonists.I am an unashamed Shyamalan fan. I love all his horror-thriller movies, even the one or two in which I can guess Shyamalan's trademark ""twist"" in advance. Yes, I even like ""The Village"" (2004). And I liked ""The Happening"" (2006) a hell of lot too.This movie indeed has said twist. I thought I guessed what it was in the opening minutes. I was wrong, and when the real twist was revealed, it was pretty damn effective. For a moment, I was as dumbfounded as the characters on screen. This was despite the fact that all the clues had been right there in front of me, and seem obvious in retrospect.And it is scary in places. A scene beneath the house comes first to mind. So does the ""oven"" bit that we see in the trailer. The cast is uniformly good. The standout was a fantastic performance by Deanna Dunagan as ""Nana.""A couple of things nudged this movie just slightly left of the ""great"" category, into the ""good but not great"" category. For one, I think this could have been a short film, and didn't need more than 40 minutes or an hour to tell its story. The pacing seems to suffer a little because of that. For the first hour, we keep revisiting the same arc in tension: a grandparent behaves strangely, a grandchild queries them, and then the behavior subsides.Character choices are also implausible. These are bright, savvy kids, who are either oblivious to or cavalier about obvious signs of danger. I think any person in real life would be too frightened to remain in the house where ""The Visit"" takes place. Later, certain things change a little too conveniently after the twist is revealed.The rapid change in tone after the story's conclusion was a little heavy-handed. I thought the story's final minutes were sweet, but maybe a little too much.Still, I'd recommend this. If you can overlook the movie's faults here and there, you'll enjoy a damn creepy modern fairytale.",The Visit

They are daring and individual. Unfortunately that's where the good stuff ends. The translation into a gripping and tense experience did not work for me this time. Yes the iconic twist about the grandparents who are not what they pretend to be is strong. There are a few creepy and almost disturbing moments and I'd have loved to see a more classic approach to it. This found footage worked only once in the Blair Witch project as it was absolutely unique at that time. All other tries are,....well tries. The main complain however was for me the cast/acting of the two kids. Especially the boy and his singing ruined for me the complete movie.

Ed Oxenbould is a Find- and a Keeper. Although his character is a lisping Crapper (a Caucasian rapper), the kid's so f---ing funny that it works; and the rest of the cast of fresh faces are also a Plus. ""People are scared of old people for no reason,"" we're told at one point. This is one of the (many) points that filmmaker David Cronenberg used to make from time to time (back when HE had something to say): that the process of AGING was truly terrifying to most people (and understandably so, as it most clearly underscores the Inevitability of Death). ""I have the Deep Darkies,"" confides an Elder, and it's THIS line, which drives home the notion of ""Sundowning,"" that's at the Dark Soul of THE VISIT. ""Sundowning"" is a very real condition, and has often led to suicide. There's a palpable sense of Place in THE VISIT which adds to the overall feeling of DREAD.

123,Ramascreen,"One of the scariest films I've seen this year! Welcome back, M. Night Shyamalan!",8,11 September 2015,"M. Night Shyamalan is back! For reals this time! Now I know that his movies in the past decade or so with ""Lady In The Water,"" ""The Happening,"" ""The Last Airbender,"" and ""After Earth"" got us wondering what the hell happened to the man who gave us ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""Signs"" and I don't blame ya, 'cause it baffled me too. But let me assure you that Shyamalan's latest installment, THE VISIT, is one helluva a comeback on his part, it's one of the scariest and also one of this year's most hysterical films and I mean that in a good way. Turns out all it took is for Shyamalan to go back to his smaller budget roots plus the involvement of super producer Jason Blum.Shyamalan cast two very talented and very young Australian actors for this film, Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould who play American siblings, Becca and Tyler respectively, who get sent by their loving single mom (Kathryn Hahn) to the countryside of Pennsylvania so that they would get to meet and hang out with their grandparents for the first time ever.At the beginning, the story gives you an idea that Kathryn Hahn's character's relationship with her parents didn't end well thus they haven't spoken to each other in years and that kinda sets the emotional tone.But what's supposed to be just a normal visit to grandparents' home, just like any of us would with our grandparents, things start to go wrong for Becca and Tyler because Nana (Deanna Dunaga) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) start displaying weird and scary and unexpected episodes that can't be explained by the simple fact that they're old.It's found footage style, so just brace yourself in case you're not a fan of this type of filmmaking, but I don't think it distracts or takes away from the horror or the suspense. The character Becca is an aspiring docu filmmaker, so that's the found footage entrance, Becca would have cameras and she'd interview the grandparents, the character Tyler is a wannabe rapper, he provides much of the comedy in this film.May I just say that THE VISIT is as frightening as it is also hilarious, and not in a way that the movie is so bad that it's laughable, not at all, I usually don't associate M. Night Shyamalan with comedy but the humor in this film, the timing, the jokes hit every single target, I'm genuinely impressed, the jokes are intentional and they land, every last one of them. It's a side of Shyamalan's storytelling that I'm not used to but I welcome it.THE VISIT is also an effective horror/suspense, just the mystery of trying to figure out what has gone wrong with the grandparents, that pretty much keeps you tied to your seat, it's so scary that while I was watching it, I found myself doing what I used to do when I was a kid watching horror movies and that is to cover my eyes with my hands but with a few fingers open because a part of me was still curious to see what was going on.The build-up is great, the execution is great, I think the young actors are talented, and I have to give credit also to the veteran actors who play the grandparents Deanna Dunaga and Peter McRobbie, they know how to play creepy and psychotic perfectly. The film is very Hitchcockian, THE VISIT reminds us of the M. Night Shyamalan we used to admire and it's good to have him back!",The Visit
124,jamiedarlow-37510,"Two thirds annoyingly boring, final third is great!",5,18 March 2020,"Redeemed slightly by the central kids performances towards the end, suspenseful goings on in the final act and a pretty awesome twist! Becca and Tyler (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) are off to visit their grandparents (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) for a week. Very quickly they begin to realise something is very wrong with their Nana and Pop Pop and begin to investigate with the help of Becca's camera. It's a very simple setup as often some of the best horrors are but unfortunately it does miss the boat which is mainly due to the kids being annoying for the most part, particularly Tyler's rapping played for comic relief which is pretty misjudged. Once would have been fine but we get it a good four times throughout the running time. Crucially though, it's not particularly scary and if anything just quite comic during the scenes intended to spook. The found footage sub genre is also the technique used for this one and it's just unfortunate this came at a time where we've seen so much of this type of horror and therefore feels predictable and bland. I'm starting to feel bad now so I'm going to start singing it's praises! Kathryn Hahn is fantastic as always as their mother and provides the more emotional scenes that work! The kids do get better towards the end in a pretty tense final sequence and Dunagan and McRobbie do their best with the material. M.

Does it make up for atrocities like ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth""? No, but let's be honest, we'll probably never be able to forgive him for those. But it feels in the style of his earlier films like ""Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village."" The plot is a bit slow in parts, but that's to build up to a great twist ending I didn't see coming, and made the last half hour of the movie absolutely terrifying. This film has it all: Mystery, suspense, even a little bit of comedy. I'm glad M. Night is trying to make great films again. How long will it last? Only time will tell. But for now, I think it's safe to say that M. Night is back on track. Even if you're not a found-footage fan, give this film a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised at how well done this film is. The kid actors feel genuine. They talk how real kids talk, they act how real kids act. That's a rarity these days. Usually child actors overact, or don't feel genuine. I'm glad to see that's not the case here. Overall, ""The Visit"" is a pleasant return to form for M. Night Shamalayan.

127,ginocox-206-336968,A decent story marred by its jiggly-cam found-footage approach,6,27 December 2015,"""The Visit"" features excellent performances, particularly by the four central characters. The story is not entirely original, but neither is it tediously familiar or shop-worn and M. Night Shyamalan gives it a few fresh twists. The jiggly-cam found-footage approach detracts far more than it adds. Many scenes seem more poorly lit than genuinely spooky. The discussion of film terms takes the audience out of the film and passing the camcorder between brother and sister and occasionally mounting one or more cameras on tripods muddles the dramatic perspective. And we get a lot of missed shots and chatter about setting up shots that doesn't advance the plot. The reveal is so heavily foreshadowed that it seems anticlimactic when it arrives. There is very little conflict or sibling rivalry between the brother and sister, which limits opportunities for growth and development of theme. At ninety-four minutes, it seems a bit slow at times and not fully developed. MNS could have kept the documentary and Skype angles, but eliminated the found footage and jiggly-cam shots and probably trimmed the film to about eighty minutes. He could have then added about twenty minutes after the reveal and really ratcheted up the suspense, terror and creepiness. Considering the prior sins of the villains, what they do to the children is fairly tame. The family crisis that precipitated the mother's departure turns out to be fairly innocuous. The reconciliation suggested by the old family movies seems unearned. I was disappointed that MNS did not have a cameo. It's a far cry from MNS's best efforts, but a significant improvement over some of his disappointments.",The Visit
128,jmoneyjohal,"M Night Shyamalan makes a decent comeback, in a good horror comedy. But more is desired from the once mastero maker.",6,11 September 2015,"Okay I am just going to say it on the onset that M Night Shyamalan is back, I mean after four pathetic flop films in a row(After Earth being the worst)finally making a decent flick is a big thing. I mean he is not back to Sixth Sense form, but like they say one film at a time right. The Visit from its trailer seemed a little underwhelming, it seemed like your regular overly hyped horror film, but what The Visit ended up being was a horror comedy,a genre hardly ever explored.M Night Shyamalan pulls off the hard genre by making even the creepiest scenes funny, the climax is a good example of this. But where the film succeeds the most is in character development of all 4 leads,but more about that later.Story wise the film is about two kids a girl in her teens named Beeca, and a boy named Tyler who is around 10 years. They are going to two stay with there grandparents for a week, who they have never meet before. This is because the kids mom had a fight with here parents when she was 19 years old about marrying a older man(the kids dad), who was her substitute teacher at her high school. The kids are dealing with there own problem because of there father leaving them, the boy has become a germ-a-phob, and the girl has lost all confidence.So while at there grandparents house they start to notice that both there nana, and pop pop are not in there best mental health, especially after 930pm the grandma goes crazy. The rest of story is about twist and turns regarding there grandparents, and the real truth about there health.Acting wise both kids Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould are pitch perfect casting, they are just superb. But the 2 grandparents Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie steal the show with there creepy act.Let me first talk about the negatives of the film, The Visit even though having a runtime of only 1hr 34min at times feels really slow especially in the first hour, at times one feels bored, and loses interest. Things just are not moving forward, there is too much character development when it comes too the kids. However in the plus the side, the film has been shot in a very interesting documentary style something M Night Shyamalan has never tried, and it works. But the films biggest positive is the characterization and casting of the grandparents. From the beginning they creep you out and they keep getting better till the end. And the films last 30 min the pre climax, and climax make up for almost all the negatives the film has.You will be scared, and laughing at the same time in the climax, its edge of the seat thrill at its best.Another big positive for me is that most horror films go into the logic less space of ghosts, monsters etc. Most horror films want you to believe something that is not true (hopefully),but M Night doesn't go the regular path, rather he makes a horror film that one could actual believe is true. And thats a big thing. Overall The Visit is a horror comedy,but I laughed more than I was scared, but I did see the audience members get spooked which was a positive. Finally if your a fan of the Horror genre give The Visit a watch, its a good film from, a one time amazing director trying to find his midas touch again.3.25/5* or 6.5/10",The Visit
129,michaelradny,Surprise Visit,7,23 September 2015,"The Visit is nothing short of a miracle for M Knight Shamalan as he serves up this tasteful parody of the overused found footage horror movies. Though it is nowhere near perfect, Shamalan manages to convince us that he is back on the right path of making great twist ending films. However, the problems with The Visit, being overly cautious and riddled with jump scares, are counteracted by the good points, being surprisingly funny and the mocking of various horror tropes and clichés. The film may not be perfect, or any where near, but what is served to us is fun, well paced and exciting to watch.

130,ritera1,"Okay, let's start at the end.",5,15 January 2017,"The grandparents are not really the grandparents. They're escaped nutcases from the local asylum that the REAL and murdered grandparents volunteered at.Now we find this out because the little boy stuck the camera, bouncing around, out the closed window and the mom saw the couple in the distance. Okay? Nevermind that the picture the camera was sending was very poor (as evidenced by the kids in the corner of the screen) and damaged earlier.Mom then tries to dial the local sheriff in that town, which she apparently knows by heart. But, of course, to no avail! She then is going to take the several hour trip by car to rescue her children, all the while trying to reach that very sheriff on the phone.Does she tell her kids to call 911 from the house itself? Nope! She does not. Do these very smart kids find a way to use the telephone or the computer to signal for help? Nope! Although very digital savvy (and plenty of Wi-Fi), I don't recall a single cell phone.But let us now go to the beginning. Estranged daughter agrees to send her kids to their grandparents house for the week. All during this there is no request by the mom or the kids for any picture(s) of the said grandparents? None at all? They're kids in a digital age AND interested in video and it doesn't come to mind?Of course not or there would not be any movie. But I digress.So the kids are at the farm and we enter the redundancy of a series of bizarre events that is a-typical of this sort of movie. A whole hour of this nonsense.Let me especially pick out the actions and physicality of the fake grandma. What I'm seeing are things that an elderly woman like her just cannot do. So I'm lead to believe there is some sort of paranormal element at work. But of course that isn't true.In this redundancy is mixed the broken family element, which really goes nowhere. In this, though, were some very good moments with the two kids. The young actors were actually very good but extremely pretentious. Far too smart for their years.Another element that farted out was the fake grandma's wanderings with the hidden camera. In her delirium she finds the camera, carries it to the kids' door and has a knife. All the while putting it in just the right position and returning it to just the right position. I know this was ""found footage"" movie, but the mechanics of doing that were just crushingly obvious.Okay, so we're back at the final battle, where we juggle cameras that all end up, conveniently, in the right place at the right time.A previous scene establishes that the little boy froze once in a football game years ago. Apparently this is now the time to freeze in front of crazy fake grampa (who knows nothing of that previous incident), otherwise the scene didn't work. And the diaper element was just plain disgusting.So we have about two minutes of fighting, grab the camera and reunite JUST IN TIME for the arrival of the cops and mommy. All the while holding the heavy camera in just the right position.Although balancing silly and stupid, there were some redeeming factors. The elderly couple were actually very good in the roles. The element of the elderly being the bad guys was very original.What was also lacking, though, was Shyamalan's directing. Except for Sixth Sense, all of his films have gloriously failed in total. (And apparently the ones I have not seen.) But I've always thought his directing was very good. He just should not be able to write anymore. But even here the directing was poor.But it did well for the $5 million budget. (Although I'm baffled what cost more than $500,000.) And that's what the movie business is all about.",The Visit
131,WalkdenEntertainment,A Visit You Will Never Forget...,7,19 January 2019,"Two siblings, Becca and Tyler get on a train and take a vacation to finally meet their grandparents for the first time. As the children begin to get know their grandma and grandad more and more they soon discover some very disturbing behaviour and the two children become more concerned.... and frightened.Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the film is made like a basic B Grade which is very different to the director's previous work (Unbreakable and Signs etc). The film even relies on the use of ""found footage"" style filming as young Tyler uses his video camera to document and capture the bizarre and scary moments which the grandparents keep displaying.To put it simply, The Visit is a tense film to watch. Because the film is done in a basic way, it can feel very realistic but it also would have kept the costing down when making the film (clever director).When it comes to grandparents, most of us could relate to spending time with them and can understand what to expect. This film matches those elements and of course takes this concept to the next level.When I watched this film I remember laughing at selected moments and also holding my cinema chair a little tighter as the film builds the suspense ever so well. The film raises many questions and thankfully delivers the answers by the closing credits with a classic M. Night Shyamalan twist and turn. While I was able to pick the ending and film's twist, the film still managed to give a heart felt message and meaning which I wasn't expecting, but found it made me rather thankful for the time I had invested in the film.Overall, I really enjoyed The Visit. Director M. Night Shyamalan goes back to basics in film making but still manages to deliver good scares, tension and a somewhat predictable twist ending. Definitely worth your time for those who enjoyed films such as Get Out even if the film doesn't warranty multiple viewing once you know the film's ending.6.8/10

133,trublu215,"While it is Shamalayan's best film in years, it is still lacking.",6,9 September 2015,"The Visit tells the story of two young children visiting their grandparents with whom they've been estranged from for 15 years. At the willingness of their mother, the children are sent to spend some time with their grandparents to get to know them. As they get to the grandparents house, they notice nefarious events beginning to occur. As an M. Night Shamalayan film, The Visit is surprisingly funny with bouts of some truly terrifying scenes. The problem here is Shamalayan seems to be selling himself short here by the style in which it is presented. That style being the cheapest way to make horror films nowadays, that is through the found footage genre. The Visit displays elements of old school scares mixed with today's technology but never really capitalizes on it like it should. The Visit would have worked better as an actual film rather than a cheap found footage horror film about crazy grandparents. If there is anything wrong with the film, it is definitely with the style. It is cheap, you can tell it's cheap, you can feel it's cheap but what keeps you moving are the performances and the actual story. The story here is surprisingly well done considering the catastrophes that Shamalayan has willing stamped his name on in the recent years. It features some surprisingly funny moments, especially from Ed Oxenbough, whose performance as Tyler is the true highlight of the film. The rest of the cast does very well, including Kathryn Hahn (whose role is more a cameo of sorts). The story, as I said above, was very good. The suspense is suspenseful, the comedy is funny and the horror is horrifying but it all doesn't seem to click over the found footage style it is conveyed as. Overall, The Visit is a welcome return to form for M. Night Shamalayan but considering what he has done prior to his slump, you can't shake the feeling that this could have been better.",The Visit
134,TheRedDeath30,"Not a Return to Greatness, but a Step in the Right Direction",7,13 February 2016,"The user reviews here are pretty extreme on this movie. It seems to be one of those movies that doesn't generate a lot of middle grade rankings, instead being a movie that people love or hate. I guess I'm going to be somewhat of an exception, then. I don't think this movie has anywhere near enough originality to qualify as a classic that would deserve a 9 or 10. On the other hand, anyone giving this movie 1 or 2 stars needs to pull the stick out of their end and lighten up.Once upon a time I worshiped the ground that the director walked upon. After all, THE SIXTH SENSE is maybe the best horror film of the 90s. He followed up with a movie I consider to be one of the best ""superhero"" films ever in UNBREAKABLE, then a sci-fi masterpiece with SIGNS. Plenty will disagree with me, sure, but armies of critics can't be wrong. Then, things went off the rail. He started trying far too hard to inject allegory into his stories and to pigeon-hole his work into a forced twist ending and it seemed each movie got worse than the last. So, when I heard the horror sites trumpeting this movie as a return to his earlier greatness, needless the say I was skeptical.There are a weaknesses here that keep this movie from really a masterpiece. Anyone familiar with the state of indie horror in the last decade has seen a glut of found footage movies. It's a cheap way to pull off a movie with minimal budget and, as a result, has become so overdone as to be a turnoff. Shy chooses this style for the movie, though it's fake found footage. Clearly, we are not intended to think we are seeing the work of a home digital camera. The movie has Hollywood gloss and looks every bit like your standard production. Best of all, it's missing the annoying hand-held shakiness. The intent of found footage is still there, though, most importantly meant to give us the perspective of two children seeing these events unfold, which is vital to the intensity of the movie and I felt added an important dimension.As with any movie that focuses on children, there are going to be conflicting views of the actors. Children can be cute and empathetic, but can easily cross the line into precocious and annoying, especially true teenagers. The attitudes and dialog of teens can off grating in the wrong hands. There are plenty of cranky reviewers on here that want to point that direction with these two actors. While I recognize that taste is individual and some see things differently than I do, I never found these two to cross the line for me, personally. Yes, the girl is a little too intelligent to be realistic and her dialog feels more like that of a college kid trying to come off as educated, but I think it was this particular character's way of dealing with the situations in her life. The two had great chemistry together and felt organic, as if they were actually a brother and sister.Shyamalan's greatest talent is on display here, though. I always felt he was weakest and crafting a story that flowed from beginning to end and, eventually, destroyed his plots by forcing them towards increasingly unlikely endings. What he was best at, though, was creating a sense of suspense and tension in his films. Point blank, the man knows how to scare an audience. This movie is no exception. I've heard far too many bash this for ""jump scares"". Guess what people, I am a student of the horror films. I've seen just about every classic horror you can think of from the silent era to this year and a majority of the history of horror is based on the jump scare. It's like saying that a horror movie relies too much on blood. It's part of the fabric of the genre. There are moments in this one that really gave me a shiver. It's very rare that a horror movie elicits any real reaction in me anymore, but I sat on the edge of my seat a few times in anticipation of what horror was awaiting outside the door, or lingering on the edge of the camera's frame.Yes, we get the twist ending that we know Shyamalan will come to and it's nowhere near the shock of THE SIXTH SENSE, but let's face it, but he may never approach that level again. Few directors ever have. It's a satisfying ending in its' own right, though.Look, if you are going to be super serious and cynical and decide going in that this movie is going to suck, then you are going to walk away with that impression. Go back to your film forums so you can bash it without even really giving it a chance. If you want to sit back and enjoy a good horror movie that remembers how to put a chill into the audience, then this is well worth the time.",The Visit
135,bababear,Good Actors Can't Save a Sinking Ship,3,20 September 2015,"The reason this got a 3 instead of a 1 (my initial response) was that the four main performers worked really hard to drag this dead horse across the finish line. Unfortunately, the film is so poorly written that I never believed any of the characters or situations so it was hard to really get involved with what happens. When a director devotes extensive footage to a thirteen year old White boy from the suburbs attempting to rap, you know he's desperate to stretch his story out to feature length.This is a textbook example of what would have been a tense and exciting thirty minute TV show and stretch it to feature length. The hand-held camera business was irritating enough that it in itself cost the project several points. There should be a special rating of S added to any film that tries to induce nausea in viewers by trying to induce motion sickness.Now, I will admit that when the Big Plot Twist came along I was surprised. Sure, variations on that twist have been used before (DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT comes immediately to mind) but it was effective.Better luck next time, Night.

137,rlaine,"Tongue in cheek, but pretty spooky, liked it",9,16 January 2017,"I'm not a Shyamalan hater, but rather like his movies. He has made hits, misses and some in between, but I think he is a smart and talented movie maker. The Village is probably my favorite of his movies, against the public opinion, and I didn't think After Earth was that bad either. Last Airbender I haven't seen. I was actually quite thrilled to run into a new Shyamalan movie - a horror one - without any prior knowledge of it. I immediately pressed play without reading any reviews. I knew reading reviews on a Shyamalan movie is not a wise thing to do. I'm not gonna spoil much, but there is a twist in this movie too and it works quite well. I'm not gonna write much of the plot here, see it yourself for best experience!I have to admit I was a bit cautious at first, wasn't sure about the possible ""lost footage"" setup and the rapping kid made me worry a little. The movie takes surprisingly long to kick off, but once the grandparents start acting a bit weird, I was totally hooked. The movie has a quirky feel to it, it's almost a horror comedy, but not quite. The scary parts are slightly over the top with a bit of comic touch, but they are very well made and I felt the movie was quite perfectly balanced with lightness and scariness. A few times I noticed myself smiling just waiting what was going to happen next, it's great fun. The acting is great here, all unknown actors to me, even the rapping kid was good in his role. Wouldn't be surprised to see him in the future. His older sister wasn't quite as much of a character, but she did her role quite well. The grandparents were perfect. Even the documentary aspect was done quite well, I did try to watch for camera ""errors"", but I didn't find anything too distracting and even forgot the cameras quite a few times.Happy to see such a fresh and indie style, down to earth ""small"" movie from Shyamalan, I'm pretty sure they had a great time doing this.",The Visit
138,youngcollind,The much maligned Mr Shyamalan turns in a solid offering,7,29 September 2021,"His track record may not be perfect, but it's kinda comforting to know what to expect from an M. Knight picture at this point. His films do have a base level of production quality, and are typically to the point and easy to follow. He'll start with a creative idea, then add in that good ol' twist that comes in all sizes of ridiculousness. In The Visit, the central idea was strong, exploring the possible horror surrounding old age and dementia. It's an under-explored topic, but a fertile one as there is plenty to fear about this very real, near inevitability that awaits us as we age. Then came the twist, and I gotta say, it was believable and advanced the plot naturally without feeling forced, so bravo! The downside for me was the found footage element, which accomplished absolutely nothing. I'm getting really tired of this gimmick when it's completely unnecessary to the story. Equally unnecessary was that they gave child star Ed Oxenbould not one, but three opportunities to showcase his mediocre rap abilities which is far more cringe than it's intended to be.",The Visit

I also liked the director's first films, and wanted to see if he has succeeded again. Unfortunately, he has not.This is not particularly good. The shame is that it could have been so much better. I do not think the way it's made is a good choice either, with this documentary style. It does not work particularly well. It is not scary enough, and the story is more strange than exciting. In the end of the film, the horror effects are good, but by then it's too late. Do not expect anew Sixth Sense. One of his lesser good film this one.

Introduction to grandparents was a little weird and they were very strange which later on will be found out. As kids try to get along and befriend them things turn out not to be very nice. Building tension is movie seems to be hidden at time and you await for something but not sure and then you realize it's happening and it's completely mad and scary. Perception that those two are mad is very fast established only thing that is missing is what are they and what is going on. After realizing horrible truth it went absolutely crazy, movie just picked pace up highly and kept it till the very end. Some things are hard to get over and there is a lot of questions that are unanswered as well as mysteries in plot.

142,g-hbe,A film of two halves.,8,8 May 2020,"M. Night Shyamalan swings from 'pretty darn bad' to 'unbelievably good' from one film to the next, but at least he dares to be a bit different and try the odd detour from the ordinary. For the first half of this film we kept looking at each other and wondering whether to continue, as it seemed to be shaping up to be just another found-footage film with the usual annoying kidz. Plenty of padding with the boy practising his rapping skills and the girl mooning around. THEN comes the surprise right out of the blue, when the kids contact their mother and she tells them something that puts a whole new light on the holiday. From then on the film gets some petrol in its tank and moves up a gear. The Visit was clearly shot for pennies, but it's good entertainment and its use of music makes a difference too. By the time the credits rolled, we were more than impressed.",The Visit

Night Shyamalan Review No One Loves You Like Your Grandparents Hello Kiddies your pal the crypt critic here and let me tell you something I may not have seen a lot of Shyamalan films but from the one's I have seen I hate him as a director. All three of them( After Earth, The Happening and Last Airbender) were boring and stupid. This is Shymalan's fifth horror film( the only one that I've seen of his) and I've got to say It was a wondrous amazement of creepiness that had a boring payoff. The terrifying story of a brother and sister who are sent to their grandparents' remote Pennsylvania farm for a week-long trip. Once the children discover that the elderly couple is involved in something deeply disturbing, they see their chances of getting back home are growing smaller every day. The film feels like another paranormal activity with a character recording everything(only in this film it has purpose) with the daughter trying to make a documentary about her family issues and since her mother won't answer a question with her and her grandparents want to see her, she thinks it would be a great opportunity to meet them and finish her film. But her and her brother notice strange things happening at night after nine thirty. They reveal character development but not much to actually give me a reason to care. The actors portraying the kids do a fine job though. But this is the right direction for Shyamalan as director, he is working with this same studio to make another horror film starring James Mcovey let's just hope the next one is more fun and creepy. I'm giving The Visit a three out of five.",The Visit
144,CleveMan66,This visit isn't really worth paying for.,4,11 September 2015,"What happened to M. Night Shyamalan in 2005? That year seems to be the dividing line between his good movies and his not-so-good movies. Shyamalan burst onto the international scene in 1999 with his masterpiece ""The Sixth Sense"". It's been all downhill from there. Even though ""Unbreakable"" (2000), ""Signs"" (2002) and ""The Village"" (2004) were critical and commercial successes, none of them reached the level of praise and recognition he had achieved with ""The Sixth Sense"". Shyamalan's post-2005 directorial efforts included the less profitable and much less appreciated ""Lady in the Water"" (2006), ""The Happening"" (2008), ""The Last Airbender"" (2010) and ""After Earth"" (2013). That brings us to the horror comedy ""The Visit"" (PG-13, 1:34), Shyamalan's next attempt to halt his long losing streak.Rebecca and Tyler Jamison (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) are New York teenagers who have never met their maternal grandparents. Their single mother, Paula (Kathryn Hahn), left her childhood home at 19. She hasn't seen her parents since and won't say why. This makes the kids curious, especially Becca. Besides, Becca and Tyler need more family connections, since their father ran off with another woman. Paula arranges for her kids to spend a week getting to know their grandparents. She puts the two teens on a train to her small hometown in Pennsylvania and sets off on a cruise with her new boyfriend. The kids are happy to give their mom a chance to get away and Becca is hoping that this visit with Nana and Pop-pop (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) will lead to reconciliation between them and Paula which is why Becca records the visit on video. She wants to make a documentary out of this whole story. Becca uses her video camera for interviews and other important moments, while her brother helps out by capturing additional footage using the video function on an old SLR camera. The video clips they capture aren't quite what they expected. Nana and Pop-pop seem nice enough, but their behavior is rather strange. The kids write off all this to the fact that their grandparents are just old. The kids learn that Pop-pop is incontinent and Nana suffers from sundowning, a type of dementia which causes symptoms to increase in the evening and at night. (""Sundowning"" was the film's original title.) Still, old or not, the grandparents' behaviors seem more creepy than quirky – and might even be dangerous.This is not your typical M. Night Shyamalan supernatural thriller, but it does borrow elements from the genre – and Shyamalan's own earlier work. Much like a haunted house movie, there are plenty of disturbing sights and sounds to go around – and they get more disturbing as the movie progresses. Although Shyamalan doesn't put a twist in ALL of his movies, there is one in this film – and it's a doozy. Odd old people, seen through the eyes of two teenagers making a movie plays as a combination of comedic and creepy through most of this film, but when the twist is revealed and its repercussions play out on screen, the comedy falls away while the creepiness increases and it's joined by a healthy dose of horror. It's also at this point that seemingly incidental details and dialog earlier in the film no longer require a sixth sense to understand.With this movie, Shyamalan halts the downward trend in the quality of his films, but doesn't quite reverse it. It was disappointing to see him resort to the found footage format. It seems like a cheap ploy to draw in audience members who are too young to remember when his better movies first came out. Although this film minimizes the camera shake and terrible angles that we usually see in the found footage format, he sacrifices authenticity when he allows video shot by two different types of cameras to look exactly the same – and have a level of quality that couldn't come from those kinds of consumer cameras. (If you're going to make a found footage film look almost like a regular film anyway, why use the technique?) Worst of all, this style of filmmaking diminishes what is actually a pretty good story.""The Visit"" would've been better off playing it straight. The ""comedy"" in this horror comedy isn't really funny. Laughing at the declining mental and physical capabilities of an elderly man and woman when the plot is basically a serious one feels wrong. The quirks that the script gives to the teens don't make them funny either and seem random. In fact, the kids are more annoying than anything else. Their intelligence and preciousness are too extreme to be taken seriously and their relationship as older sister and younger brother doesn't ring true. This attempted return to form for Shyamalan is best visited on video – if at all. ""C+""",The Visit
145,Jared_Andrews,"Delivers a few scares, laughs and even a twist",5,13 April 2016,"There were effective moments. Some moments succeeded in scaring the audience. Some moments of over-the-top fake scary moments that came across as funny. Both these types of scenes worked. Even with the entire theater expecting a twist, it still managed to surprise and serve as the scariest moment in the movie. The twist's reveal was perfect because it was delivered in a single memorable, quotable line much like ""I see dead people."" Certain moments in the movie were supposed to be scary but simply weren't because they didn't really make sense. They were just odd moments. Odd doesn't necessarily make something scary. Many times the grandparents acted strangely but not in a scary way. Just odd.I think the main reason the movie bugged me was that the girl was phony. I saw this pretentious wannabe film geek that didn't really know much about making films. I saw a lot of M. Night in her. He thinks he's super smart and capable of making deep, provocative movies but for the most part he isn't. His movies are typically pretty bad.The movie was a mess. Sloppy. It didn't know what it wanted to accomplish. It's a family relationships movie. It's a horror movie. It's a comedy. It tries to be all those things but it winds up missing the mark on all of them.If you aren't looking for anything more than a movie with a couple scares and laughs with a fun twist at the end, you may enjoy it.

It's creative and pretty well done. But it's honestly just not that good either. And it shows that M Night Shamalan may be actually loosing his mind.

Minimalist horror.,7,5 May 2020,This defaintly one of the best movies to employ the found footage/ hand-held camera style. There has been other successful films but this among them at the top. Camera work is very good considering its limitations. Very creepy and chilling minimalist horror that will make you very uncomfortable. It does't depend on cheap thrills or CGI but works with its natural spooks. The grandparents actors do an amazing job both eerie and familiar at the same time. Unfortunately the film also comes with certain amount of cringe. While some of the back story filimg is good the children actors can be over bearing at times.

152,manuelasaez,"Not a bad film, per se, but that annoying white kid ruined it for me",5,28 September 2015,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I have never given up on M.Night. I liked Lady in the Water, I loved The Village and I appreciated what he tried to do with The Happening. After Earth and the Last Airbender were travesties, but every director is allowed a few duds. I just think that his good work far outweighs his bad. That being said, I didn't care much for this film. The acting was passable, and the story was decent, but I literally called the twist out 30 minutes into the film as a joke, and when it came to fruition, my partner was like, ""How did you know?!?"". It's M.Night, you can see where his stories are going from a mile away now (if you are a fan of his, that is).There were a few elements of the film that worked; the creepy (and surprisingly agile) granny, the intelligent and precocious granddaughter, the questionable and well realized grandfather; those all worked well. But that damned rapping idiot kid (""ethnically confused"", as they called him in the film) was so.damned.annoying with his need to constantly remind everyone that he is a product of the generation that is confused due to technology, and have no taste in good music. Perhaps it's due to the fact that I absolutely despise rap ""music"", but every time he opened his mouth to say something ghetto, I died a little inside. It was like the kid was trying so hard to be cool, and I'm sorry, but there is just nothing cool about the things he liked. He was a huge sour note in an otherwise decent film. I would have been angry had I paid to see it in a theater, so I am glad I saw it the way I did. Overall, not as bad as M.Night's recent offerings, but not the return to form that many are suggesting.A note to M. Night; If you choose to have teenagers in your movies, make sure that they do not annoy the audience. It really can make or break your film when people who have so much screen time contribute so little to the overall quality of the film.",The Visit

154,FKDZ,Really creepy but not too exciting in the end.,7,3 July 2021,"I'd say overall I really enjoyed this movie, except for the fact I dropped out after the first 15 minutes during the early train rapping scene, I just couldn't handle it. But I picked it up again later that night and I'm happy I did. I noticed I had to sit through a quite a bit to get comfortable with the characters and start liking them. As they do become likable thankfully.I think the biggest thing this movie got going for it is its general creep/weird factor and scenes that just make you anxious or jump. I found it much less predictable here than other typical scary movies, because the tension is kept pretty high.The acting is great overall, aside from the at times exaggerated dialog that is mainly due to the script. Also the characters have a little too much tolerance sometimes in my opinion to stuff that's happening. I do see how some people could see more comedy in this movie versus horror/thrill though.The directing, I think it was fine, the style.. shakey handcam is a bit overplayed. But luckily they had two and definitely played in favor of the movie allowing some great shots.''The main event''... I felt was underplayed by the mother?

155,stephendaxter,A long awaited return to form for M.Night Shyamalan,7,21 September 2015,"This movie sees the return of M. Night Shyamalan, a director who is known for great films such as 'Signs' and 'The Sixth Sense', but on the opposite end of the spectrum he has also made films like 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth', and then 'The Happening' sits somewhere in between terrible and genius. It feels like we have been waiting forever to see M. Night return to making good films and it looks like with this film i can say that the seemingly impossible has happened, 'The Visit' marks the return of the master of twists. For me his return happened this year with the AMAZING mini-series Wayward Pines but in terms of movies this is the return. It is not one of the best horror movies i have seen recently but the combination of horror and thrills with some laughs here and there really worked in this film as oppose to his other attempts. If i was to describe this movie in one word it would have to be 'weird', this movie was just so incredibly odd and at times creepy and it had me on the edge of my seat more times than not. The grandparents in this film were some of the most unsettling characters this year, there was something really odd about them and i couldn't put my finger on it. Even when they weren't creepily crawling around there was always something off about them, and M. Night managed to show that really well. I won't talk any more about the grandparents and what is going on with them as his famous 'twist' is back, even though i didn't really think it was that great i definitely couldn't pick it out until the reveal. When you try to add comedy into a horror film that looks like it was trying to take itself seriously you run the risk of it becoming too cheesy. But somehow he managed to make the comedy really work, it wasn't overpowered by the horror and it didn't make the film look too silly, although, it definitely had its fair share of well timed comedy. There were surprisingly a few laugh out loud moments that lighten the mood and contrast the dark tones very well making it quite enjoyable. The performances in this film were actually pretty damn good but not exactly great. The grandparents played that creepy and mysterious role well and were very convincing, also the two kids played the characters well even though i thought the characters were kinda typical stereotypes in these types of horror films. In terms of what i didn't like, i have to say that the first 15-20 minutes was very cheesy and at times cringeworthy whilst introducing this family. But when the horror elements get introduced that is when the film picks up and the kids grew on me. The pacing was also a little off, similar to Paranormal Activity, you have patches of creepy activity and then a few patches of more slower story driven sections. Some of these more slower scenes i felt went for a little too long between the thriller scenes but it was just a minor thing. In the end, this was a very difficult film to review, it was just a very weird film and it is going to take me a couple of days to take it all in and get a clear view of what was good and what wasn't so for now i gotta say i enjoyed this film. It was a good blend of comedy and horror had gives a good amount of fun and at the same time creeps you out. It was definitely a film worth watching and i am curious to see if he can continue this good run. - 6.8",The Visit

After a while I realised how forgettable this film is.The first hour is tortuously dull. Two precocious kids take a couple of cameras to visit nana and gramps. And that's it. An entire hour of very, very slow storytelling with some emphasis on the uncanny. It's an unsuccessful attempt to develop an atmosphere of impending dread. I'mThe main problem with this film is the underlying premise that it's perfectly acceptable to send your kids off to meet your estranged parents, whom you've not spoken to for 15 years, while you go for a luxury cruise with your boyfriend. Why the hell would anyone in their right mind consider doing this?So the kids arrive at the grandparents and they are weird. Possibly senile or is there something more sinister going on?But this isn't normal senility, friends and neighbours are worried. And the plot plods along and gramps keeps his poo in a shed and nana goes mental and the computer gets mysteriously damaged and so on and so on.The Visit is clearly building up to a big ending but takes so long to get to the point that by the time anything finally happened I really struggled to care.Seriously nothing happens in this movie for an hour and 20 minutes and by the time it gets to the big twist the sheer idiocy of the plot really irritated the hell out of me.",The Visit

And them doing ridiculous things that nobody would actually do.* Speechy-preachy dialogue.* Long, drawn-out scenes, over and over - except that this time most of them - MOST of them - actually *contribute* to the overall effect rather than just boring the viewer.* Focus on the completely wrong targets: the guy always makes the film he thinks he's making, rather than the one the viewers actually end up seeing, so you end up with these completely non-sequitur, irrelevant 'development' scenes. In this case there is a completely tacked-on pre-ending that leaves the viewer going 'Why is this here? Why are we supposed to care?'-Amazingly, NONE of which destroys it:-The intro is attention-grabbing.The build-up is stately and involving.The Weird piles-on quite disturbingly.And the twist is a GOOD one instead of something DUMB!-This is the first thing I've seen since The 6th Sense that wasn't write-off rubbish.Maybe he's got on, or off, the right medication?? - -- ---",The Visit

Night Shyamalan's commercial misfires (or rather miscarriages) like Lady in the Lake (ugh!), Airbender (what the hell was he thinking?) and After Earth, I decided to give him one more shot in the shape of The Visit. What worked in his favor was his superb work on the small screen in the form of the 2015 mini-series Wayward Pines - which made me believe that deep down inside Shyamlan's heart still resides a true artist, and not some lazy hack who tackles big-budget flops just to get paychecks from the studio. His recent talk in interviews about gaining back artistic control of his products was another positive step in Shyamalan's long path to cinematic forgiveness.And so I entered The Visit, a somewhat short and intimate tale of two precocious teenagers, a brother (13) and sister (15), who travel cross country to meet and spend a week with their estranged grandparents, whom they have not seen or met since birth due to a big family feud their divorced mother (Kathryn Hahn, the most recognizable face in the cast) refuses to talk about. The sister, Becca (the promising Olivia DeJonge) also happens to be an aspiring filmmaker, out to make a documentary about the big reconciliation, which ever so conveniently sets the movie up in the popular found footage sub-horror genre - but also opens a wide crack for endless jokes and self-aware nods towards the unsuspecting audience.Anyway, as you could probably tell by the previews, something isn't quite right with Poppa and Nanna, and even though at first they seem like reasonably nice elder folks, their strict rules (do not get out of the room after 21:30, do not go down to the basement) and strange manners (you'll see what I'm talking about) soon enough make it clear to both Becca and Tyler (the smaller brother portrayed by the superb Ed Oxenbould, who at 14 shows endless promise) that they better get the hell out of there - as fast as they could.Besides the trademark Shyamalan twist, which actually works here and seems reasonable in hindsight (unlike, say, The Village), the extremely self-aware script and the very natural and authentic brother-sister relationship between both co-leads, lends further credence to Shyamlan's pet project. You can see that he cared for the characters, and you can also easily remember that this is a director who made a reputation for himself because he managed to facilitate such an emotional and iconic performance out of then-11-year-old Haley Joel Osment, so obviously he's good with kids. I don't know if young Ed Oxenbould is the next Osment, but he sure does deliver the goods through and through - and gives one of the best children/teen performances I've watched in a while.",The Visit

Knight use to be one of my favorite directors/producers in the industry of film up until ""Lady in the Water"". I thought ""The Visit"" would have been like a redemption or a comeback film for M. Knight Shyamalan but it was just as ridiculous as some of the other films he has made in the recent past. I was led to see this film from watching the trailer and hearing about it from one of my coworkers. Like a lot of horror films now a days the trailer looked cool but the actual film itself wasn't all that cool. One thing I did like about this film was the character of Nana (Deanna Dunagan). She did put that horror in this horror film, giving the kids a legitimate reason to stay in their room after 9:00. Her possessed like ways and actions at times and at night throughout the film was impressive I just wish it was portrayed in a better film. Hopefully M. Knight Shyamalan will become one of my favorite directors/producers again. I can't wait for that day happen.",The Visit
162,palavitsinis,Nice! As usual M. Night Shyamalan,7,7 January 2016,"Well, we saw this one right after the Orphan (2009). I think the Orphan was more on the 7.5 side and this more to the 6.5, but still gave to both a 7. M. Night Shyamalan has created a really original movie. I know for some time now that when it comes to his movies, he can be trusted to product a decent final outcome (at least). The movie is awesome. It borders on the side of the paranormal but it's not about that, although at some points you're almost sure that's the case. The actors performed amazingly, especially the young boy! Really liked the comedic elements within the film that broke the tension now and then! The plot twist is right there and the hand-held cameras are of course one of the elements that make the difference, following the years-long trend started since the Blair Witch project I guess!",The Visit
163,autisticreviewers,We actually enjoyed it!,7,5 October 2015,"I don't know how many times we (Jay and Nick) have watched the ""found footage"" movies and just constantly roll our eyes! ""Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity"" etc, you get it! Somehow The Autistic Reviewers were able to look beyond that and see something quite unique and original.The acting was fantastic, both by the kids and the Grandparents. Ed Oxenbould (who's an Australian actor) puts on the best performance. He's both funny, dramatic, charming and a great (hilarious) rapper! The plot is pretty simple. Nothing too fancy! The kids, for the first time ever decide they want to meet their Grandparents and want to film every second they get! Sadly...it doesn't take long for things to get weird. After 9:30 Grandma runs around, vomits, scratches the walls naked and sometimes like to pick up knives! While Grandpa likes to hide things in the barn and put guns in his mouth! Normal behaviour, right? As the final 20 mins sinks in, the twists and turns start coming and it's quite surprising to say the least, but at the same time, has you on the edge of your seat! There was un necessary comedy thrown in there, which didn't seem to fit, but what the film was good at was keeping every scene both funny and serious and spooky at the same time.All in all The Autistic Reviewers give this movie a 7/10. It's worth watching.",The Visit

Night Whateverman was using two young actors to deflect criticism of the movie-as most people would be reluctant to put the film down knowing that might negatively impact on the careers of the two younger main characters in this movie. This movie blows basically: but not because of the actors-its just that the script is not very good. The director is to blame. M. Night has made a few pretty good films that many people didn't like very much which is unfortunate. I read somewhere that the director had managed to get himself into a six million dollar hole and his film projects were an attempt to rectify that situation. Making films like this probably won't be helping him very much although he might have given a boost to two young actors with this current ""offering.""",The Visit

166,Genti23,Not Bad.,7,16 December 2015,"The Visit is a 2015 found footage horror/comedy film written,produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.The film stars Olivia DeJonge,Ed Oxenbould,Deanna Dunagan,Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn. This movies is about two little kids named Becca and Tyler that head deep into Pennsylvania farm country to meet their maternal grandparents for the first time.They do this so that they can give her mother some time alone with her new boyfriend Miguel so that she can be happy.Everything seems to go well up until the two kids notice their grandparents increasingly strange behaviors day by day and they get more and more concerned as to why these things are happening and what is the meaning behind it all. The Visit is a return to form for writer/director M. Night Shyamalan as he has done some not-so-good movies recently.In this one though,he decides to do something different and with a small budget he tackles on found footage movies. This movie is funny,surprisingly,and interesting to a point.The acting is really good in it especially by the two kid actors,Ed Oxenbould who brings the comedy in the movie and makes the experience better,Olivia DeJonge who is the one filming this all and the movie does give a good enough reason as to why she is doing so.Olivia did bring some of the more heartfelt scenes to life and she did it perfectly. One of the main problems with this movie is that it mixes comedy and horror way to much that at a point you can't even tell if they're joking or being serious anymore cause it sort of plays out as cheesy.The two older actors do a great job but their characters aren't at always at their best.Sometimes they just came out as annoying and/or dumb. The ending is pretty good and brutal and it does have a little nice twist to it.Ultimately though it does feel like its dragging on for a bit too long but anyways this is a good and a welcome return to form for Shyamalan and I hope he does more movies like this and less big budget ones.",The Visit

""How did M. Night direct this? There's nowhere on set that he could be!""
I have come to this conclusion.
He didn't direct it.
These dumb kids did. That's why this is so bad. These dummies were the only ones on set. They had no parental supervision. That explains the atrocious acting,The cringe freestyles, and the 90% of nonsense that this film consisted of. Very very very bad movie.Good fun to laugh at though! But usually you don't laugh in a supposed horror movie!Honestly, if you watch this with the idea that this movie is a comedy, you will have a blast.

However, I was willing to forgive the movie when it was used by the young boy at the start - I just skipped past it.Then there was the meat of the movie - yes, a nice build up of tension. It's a little unusual - I would have thought the kids would have started being more worried earlier on, but perhaps with their ""documentary"" they thought it was useful material and not overly bothersome.All good so far. Then the story takes a massive downward turn, crashing and burning into the ground. When these old people, who have dementia, attack the kids and the kids do almost nothing at all - yet amazingly they manage to hold on to their cameras the entire time! The girl gets locked in a room with the crazy woman - is that a POKER I spy that she moves the camera light over twice? Does she even think to use it to clobber the insane woman (who is under a bed sheet and can't even see!) or break the door? No! Likewise, the boy is in the kitchen with plenty of kitchen implements to use as weapons but does NOTHING. Then the girl arrives on the scene, having escaped (finally) and, well, you'd think she'd grab that big old pot in the sink to crack the old man's skull. NOPE! She just pushes him so he can get up and attack her.Useless and totally unbelievable dribble. I felt thoroughly cheated by the last 10 minutes. Don't waste your time with this - I honestly think those two kids could have written a better script and filmed it in a more believable way than this crap.At least I was saved from watching the credits.

I like intelligent and innovative movies with new turns and twists that makes me say ""Oh...!! THAT'S A NEW ONE!"". This movie did that to me.So... off to a visit. A documentary about siblings making a visit to their grandparents for the first time. They arrive. They are cozy. It's on the countryside. Old people with little love and making cookies. Then. Something strange is going on. Is it just in a state of mind? Is it only a blown up illusion and experience of old people making impression unto the younger ones? Or is it...? That thought is driving this whole movie for a good amount of time. M. Night Shyamalan is turning up the heat after having gone through his typical mental and psychological perspective of different topics. It's coming closer....it's coming closer.........The actors and the director is great. I really like Ed Oxenbould after seeing him in ""Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"". His charming innocence and beautiful eyes makes the aspects of horror in this one even more....spooky? Olivia DeJonge is also bringing her A-game in this one, so are the old couple.M. Night Shyamalan is getting right to it and I sense there has been both contemplating and development on his behalf as a director and movie writer.

171,LiveLoveLead,Creepy and funny at the same time...,7,8 June 2016,"Not what I expected. Suspenseful while being humorous at the same time. The entire movie is filmed documentary, hand-held camera style. The two kids are going to see grandparents that have been estranged from their mom for 15 years. The daughter decides to use this opportunity to film ""the visit"" as a sort-of documentary of the mom's life, where she grew up, interviewing her parents (the grandparents) and maybe figure out how to bring about a reconciliation in the process. The movie is unexpected in how bizarre it is, but also a bit of a character study in how it delves into the deep seeded feeling the kids have been suppressing since their mom and dad got divorced. All the creepiness keeps you hooked on trying to figure out what the heck is going on with this eccentric couple. This movie is not perfect by any means and as thrillers often do, it has it's skeptical parts, but it pretty much answers every question raised and has a decent ending. It was a bit difficult to rate because this movie is not going to be for everyone and although my 22-year-old son and I both got a kick out of this movie, it's not something I'd watch again and I'd only recommend it to certain people.

Basic story a single mom life goes crazy after her children visit there grandparents with some twisted results. Olivia Dejonge (becca) and ed oxenbould (tyler) are the kids and play there roles well, don't expect a massive scare in this film as it was done on a low budget but what you will get is a great film that shows when m.night shyamalan does try he can deliver.",The Visit
173,MattBirk,"Better than his previous films, but that's nothing to brag about...",5,11 September 2015,"I will admit there were times during The Visit when there was a smirk on my face and at times I actually laughed out loud. As strange as the kids were, there were times when their weirdness was actually amusing. That's a good thing because the movie was clearly trying to focus on being just as funny as it wanted to be creepy. But most of the time the children felt too artificial and fake outside of those few moments. The sister is an over the top aspiring filmmaker and the brother is a mildly amusing aspiring rapper. Their quirks work some of the time but most of the time they felt too fake for its own good. Which didn't help things considering the movie is roughly 80% of those two characters talking directing into the camera.Which leads into my next point, why did this need to be found footage? Because everything that can go wrong with found footage, basically went wrong here. Shaky camera at times when the movie should be building suspense or tension in the scene. Instead all we are seeing is the camera rolling around as the operator is fleeing from the scene. Or if someone is being attacked or running, we can't see a damn thing. Or at other times, characters are fiddling with a camera during an illogical situation. I appreciate trying to mask the found footage process by explaining the daughter is trying to make a documentary, but it's unnecessary none the less.While The Visit may have scenes of characters acting completely strange or odd, there isn't a sound atmosphere to maintain an actual sense of unease. Things may get weird, but never do they feel suspenseful and that has to be the main problem. Something odd happens and then we jump to the following day knowing things are going to get progressively worse. It's not that the movie is predictable (it isn't) but we as an audience sort of know how the structure will play out.If you get a chance and want to see a horror movie with a strong atmosphere, check out Austria's official entry to the 2016 Academy Awards, Goodnight Mommy instead of this (It also opened today, but in a limited number of theaters). So is this the return for Mr. Shyamalan? Hell no, but he's slowly returning to form.",The Visit

When there tries to be a scare it is the dumbest thing like grandma running around the living room naked. The characters are annoying and i did not care if anything happened to them, i was wishing for something to. The kid is annoying and not funny. The acting is terrible.

175,HorrorOverEverything,A Decent Take On The Found Footage Genre,6,26 September 2015,"I have watched countless found footage films, way more than any one person should, so I have been worn out on the genre for a while (but for some reason I keep watching them). I was intrigued to see what Shyamalan could do with the genre, I have liked the majority of his movies (even the ones people hated on such as The Happening and Lady In The Water).So the thing that stood out to me right away was how obnoxious the brother character was, some of his lines are cringe-worthy and honestly I feel like he completely ruined a few scenes that could have been really good. The sister is fair enough, beside the brother she seems like the most interesting character ever though. The problem with having kid actors in these types of movies is that in horror films you really want the characters to seem like they are actually in danger, with this though their performances weren't convincing and really brought down the overall creepiness of the film. The acting isn't all bad though, both the grandparents were portrayed well and really carried the movie.The story overall is pretty good, but there are some things that really hold it down. A lot of scenes that are suppose to be really serious, emotional, and creepy kind of just came off cheesy. There are definitely some scenes that work well though, there were a few times where the film had me jumping and leaning forward on the edge of my seat. The story mostly hinges on you wanting to find out what is going on, and once you do figure things out it is satisfying enough, not anything overly special but it works.""The Visit"" isn't a great film, but it is slightly above average. You never feel bored while watching it and there are some genuinely scary scenes. However a few cheesy characters and some laughable moments really stopped this from being Shyamalan's golden comeback, still a decent effort from him though.6/10",The Visit

I think this style is popular because it gives you a more authentic feel when watching, and helps build up the tension by not revealing too much. In fact, since this style of movie-making is so popular with horror, even a video clip of people driving makes me think of horror movies nowadays. So, wise choice of cinematography Shyamalan.

I'm scared !,10,3 October 2015,"This was one of the rarest horror movies that managed to keep me totally scared and mostly uncomfortable from start to finish in years and years. I don't get this new trend of hating everything Shiamalan does. This new movie is one of the best horror concepts I've come across in a very long time and uses simplicity to the best effect. I don't get what people these days expect an horror movie to be. If you don't think this a good example of a simple concept that works like a dream...or a nightmare, I don't get what passes for horror in Hollywood no more. The idea for this movie is fantastic, and it's very well executed. I really don't get why people complain that nothing happens in this story. It's that type of simplicity that keeps the scary atmosphere throughout the entire movie. This is not a cgi crap action so called horror thing for teens, this is a classic old school horror, it's filled with a creepy atmosphere and uses perfectly all the ideas for each character to keep the viewer feeling uncomfortable all the time. There's a couple of good scares ,but most of the horror really happens inside our minds. This is the best thing in this movie, it creates such an atmosphere of tension with simple things that when something really dramatic happens on screen we get ten times more startled and there's no need for any cgi on this movie at all to scare teenagers and bore the rest of us to death with the usual clichés. Not on this one.This is clearly an horror movie for adults, its not edited at two hundred frames per second and it has a classic structure that simply is not targeted at young audiences. This is an horror movie for horror fans, it's not a popcorn movie for general audiences so ignore the bad ratings on IMDb, because if you remember the good classic stuff from the 70s like The Omen, The Changeling, or all those movies built on atmosphere instead of action, this movie is for you.Absolutely brilliant. In my view the only thing that does not work is the final sequence after the twist is revealed, simply because the movie stops being a a story that creeps us out and becomes the usual fight for your life action bit we've seen hundreds of times. But until that happens this story is scary. Not because of what it shows but because of what keeps making us expect it's going to happen next.Shyamalan is really back and this screenplay is the best thing he's ever written since the sixth sense and unbreakable. Also the casting is simply perfect with brilliant performances from everyone.True horror is back folks. Ignore the bad hype from the multiplex popcorn crowd.

178,Brevin_Campbell,The best written Shyamalan in a long time,7,18 August 2016,"I hate found footage horror movies. There all god awful from beginning to end at least until you get to a movie like this, and it gives you back the hope in the horror genre that you may have lost. This film does that on all levels from the very start of the film and until the end. The idea here is that this young girl named Becca(Olivia DeJonge) is doing a little documentary and is a film student as well. As a result she brings her camera over and tries to get her grandmother apologizing to her mother so that way they can be close again. She goes over with her younger brother named Tyler(Ed Oxenbould) and they try and have a nice time at there grandparents home. As the movie goes on it builds up a level of mystery and intrigue only seen in films like 10 Cloverfield Lane and Midnight Special. And yes M. Night has made a good enough movie to compete with those types of films.The narrative is very smart and very dynamic as well, and it has a twist that actually makes a whole lot of sense and then you realize that M. Night is a lot smarter of a film maker than we could have ever expected him to be. The film that falter in not only being a found footage film, but also there are certain directing shots that don't have the flow that M. Night was going for and at certain points actually do hamper the enjoyment of the film overall. The acting here is also very good as well as the kids feel like there just kids and they do things that only kids would do. This is undoubtedly one of the better films that M. Night has put out and deserves a decent amount of praise for what he manages to do here as well",The Visit

But for me - it was utterly ruined by the protagonists.Now i do not care much for kids in movie roles. More often than not they are not only useless as plot devices but also annoying. These two kids occupy the most annoying space possible. The boy is rapping (cringe) and the girl is determined to produce a documentary - and seems never to let go of the camera - even when fighting for her life (admirable indeed).The grandparents are quite mad ... not in a subtle way... no! - they act as crazy as it gets before being classified as possessed by demons. (but that would be a different movie then)The Shyamalan trademark twist is probably a huge shock for the protagonists - but was hardly one for me as a viewer. Although i did not expect it - i simply did not care. What bothered me most was the unnatural dialogue, the actions and reactions between the grandparents and the children. It never felt genuine - or ""how a real person would do it"". Also the pacing in the 2nd act was rather slow. There was hardly any plot development and it got quite boring. However - i would still give it a 4/10 - because i think the story itself had potential. In my opinion - it should have been a whole lot more subtle with much more likable protagonists.",The Visit
180,byson5186,No Point Really,4,27 April 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan is a known director. He obviously is best known for 6th Sense. That's a good and clever movie. I seriously can't believe that movie is almost 17-years old. We can see how much Haley Joel Osment has aged in recent pics. He is also the director of another Thriller a 2002 movie that doesn't seem talked about so much, but it isn't a bad movie, Signs.You don't hear much of the director Shyamalan anymore, and even when you do it seems like nobody really thinks of him as an ideal film director anymore with recent films including this. We have After Earth, I haven't seen After Earth but that movie has had horrible reviews, and while we might remember Jaden Smith from Karate Kid, and not think of him as a bad actor in that film, Jaden Smith's reviews have gone down because of After Earth. Will Smith who is a popular actor, considers it the worst thing he's done in his career.I wanted to rent this movie. I mean remembering the popular Sixth Sense, I wanted to see how this new thriller which came out over a decade later would be. I've been seeing some bad reviews for it along with good reviews, which almost every film will have both. I wanted to see if I'd end up enjoying it.While this movie might have been well thought out of to make a scary movie, it wasn't an ideal film. Here are reasons. It has a couple of scary scenes, and it has a clever idea of kids staying at their grandparents and seeing their grandparents acting creepy. But, here are the problems with the movie. It can be entertaining to see movies shot from a camcorder perspective where the characters make videos. That's the way Earth To Echo was shot. It makes the movie seem a little more real. However, this movie was shot from that perspective and almost didn't have any background music throughout the film, making it look like you were watching reality T.V. or a YouTube video. But, also making the film more boring.Almost the whole movie took place in rural Pennsylvania. While that might have cut costs, basically the whole film is seeing videos a brother and sister make, Becca and Tyler, and noticing their grandparents acting crazy. It still was a bit entertaining, and there's a twist, but even with the twist, the movie is hard to understand, and it is like what happened?Basically, this whole movie is what you expect from the trailer and what you see from the reviews. In one sentence, it's kids staying at their grandparents house, and while their grandparents seem pretty normal most of the time, they start acting creepy other moments. It's even hard to understand why?I leave this movie with a 4/10",The Visit
181,valen060,Shyamalan's Long-Awaited Return to Real Filmmaking. A Visit Worth Taking.,7,12 September 2015,"Based on what I've witnessed, The Visit was something I did not expect to be so frightfully and humorously blended by a decade-long troubled filmmaker. Definitely marks a return for M. Night Shyamalan as a director. From a retrospect, this is a movie that has a few similar themes as his past hits that date back to 1999. Ever since The Sixth Sense to Unbreakable, and then Signs, these had interesting stories with twists not many would expect to understand until it's unveiled. Here, in this movie, its twist was done admirably (albeit accompanied with some humor leading up to it), but to avoid spoilers, you'll have to see for yourself on how it unfolds.Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould play young teen siblings Rebecca and Tyler as they must spend the next few days at their estranged grandparents' house. Their mother Paula (played by Kathryn Hahn) has had quite an unpleasant history with them when she married at a young age and had thus not spoken with them since. Although they remain uncertain of what really happened between their mom and her own parents, Rebecca - an aspiring filmmaker - decides to explore further of the goings-on in the grandparents' house, but not without following their few ground rules that continually piques her and her brothers' interest further.With Shyamalan's storytelling/twist crossed together with Jason Blum's Paranormal Activity ""found footage"" concept, it helped pull the spotlight on the two sibling characters as the real stars that shine in this movie. Ed Oxenbould's Tyler shows off interesting humor when nothing bothers him. He started to somewhat remind me of Haley Joel Osment (Sixth Sense-era) when he is put on the spot as the potential, troubled victim in one scene. While Olivia DeJonge's Rebecca has a rather inquisitive personality and can't help but play detective on the strange behaviors their grandparents openly express day in and night out, especially.In the past decade, people have constantly been mocking, berating, and even pointing out M. Night Shyamalan's blunders that they ultimately found him a lost cause to the filmmaking industry. However, with a relatively low production budget and allowing him to be paired with 'Paranormal Activity' producer Jason Blum for this latest suspenseful flick, it all actually worked out. It was pleasing with the thrills and sudden surprises that I couldn't anticipate all of them so easily. Not quite at the groundbreaking level as The Sixth Sense at all, but it was more than enough to satisfy that this is Shyamalan written all over it. If anyone had caught his mini-series Wayward Pines (with Terrance Howard), that show basically jump-started his squandering career and giving him the push needed to produce a new, interesting movie. When the credits started to roll, I was at a loss for words. I just nodded my head confidently since all it took was for Shyamalan to return to his roots. He rightfully earned this one and I was not left disappointed. As long as Shyamalan sticks with this type of storytelling he knew well those years ago, he can't go wrong.",The Visit

Shaky camera angles are becoming the norm in far too many movies, especially in the horror/thriller genre and it is really sad. Movies should present a view as if you are there and watching but since when does your sight jump around as if your eyeballs were throw in a blender. It's just a lazy approach by filmmakers who can't offer any kind of decent choreographed scenes. Just shake the camera around dude and people will think it's a cool hectic scene ?? Unbelievable.

185,tjgoalie13,"Hilarious, but Not Very Scary",6,14 September 2015,"The Visit is often hilarious, seldom really scary, but features one of the best twists in Shyamalon's career since The Sixth Sense. If you're expecting a great horror film, you may be disappointed, but if you're looking for a fun time at the theaters this is a good choice. Whether it be good or bad, I could not stop laughing while watching this film, up until the end. The film relies on jump scares to scare, but most of them are hard to take serious and come across as funny. I didn't like the characters in this film, Ed Oxenbould did as good as he could, but Olivia DeJonge plays a 15 year old aspiring filmmaker who knows more industry lingo than Steven Spielberg, the fact of the matter is if the girl were that smart she wouldn't be making a documentary about her grandparents. Throughout the dialogue is annoying, the plot's a little thin, the characters are flat, the film fails to scare, and the found footage aspect wears thin quickly. However all shortcomings fade by the end as a twist at the level of the Sixth Sense completely flips the plot on it's head, this twist saves the movie and makes a fun film to watch a great theater experience. I highly suggest you see this in a theater so you can hear the laughter and then listen as the theater goes dead with the reveal of the twist.",The Visit

This David Blum just keeps raking in the bucks, because the budgets are always below five million dollars, and the kids will keep forking out their sixteen bucks for garbage, because they see the name M. Night on it, or Paranormal Experience Seventy Five, and as long as they can make forty million on it, they've made a thirty five million dollar profit on it, which is what it's all about anyway. Why hire great actors, great composers, etc.., when you can hire anyone who the kids can relate to, because after all, it's found footage. M.

My only complaints would be the forgiveness scene.It felt totally unnecessary & should've been left out & only added as a deleted scene.I think The Visit should've ended with the back of the cop car.If it did, The Visit would've ended perfectly.My other complaint would be the final rap scene.Another thing that was unnecessarily added at the end.Other then that, The Visit was just straight up CREEPY from start to finish.I would tell anybody & everybody to see it.Even better, watch it with the lights off, late at night but Most of all, turn it off after the scene in the cop car",The Visit
189,Oberrated,Oh Shyamalan...,5,21 April 2016,"Guys, I was ready to hate this movie and by ALL means, it is nothing extraordinary, BUT, it was not half bad. Yes, you read that right. I still have a sour taste in my mouth from Shyamalan sh**ting on my childhood with ""The Last Airbender"" and the hour and forty minutes wasted watching ""After Earth"", but that is all a rant by request for another time. ""The Visit"" was comedic at times and mostly due to the out there antics of the grandparents. It was creepy and un-settling but again, not half bad. The classic Shyamalan twist is present in this movie and, in my opinion, not so predictable but to any non- casual movie-goer, you may be able to catch it before it happens. So the bottom-line: You want a creepy horror movie with a dash of comedy? You have your movie within ""The Visit"". Will you leave floored and wanting more? No. Will you leave in utter disgust, fighting the box office attendant for a refund? Possibly but not probable.

I was going to skip it - considering it wasting my time, but my wife insisted. Afterwards, I was pleasantly surprised and glad we watched it.It's not really a very typical horror film. It's not even a typical M. Night film. It is scary at times, but mostly creepy. It leaves you glued, wondering what's going to happen next. Which is what a film is supposed to do.It's low-budget. There isn't anybody in it you would recognize. Which, to me, made it seem more ""real."" It's not perfect. It does have some clichés, some jump out and ""BOO!"" kind of scares, which turn some people off. It is NOT a 'found footage' film. Reviewers who labeled it that don't know the definition. The young girl is trying to shoot a documentary and SOMETIMES you look through the camera lens as she's filming. But it's NOT the whole movie and nobody finds the footage. The camera is sometimes shaky, but they are kids, not pros, and it doesn't do that very long. It does have very few plot issues that you kind of have to ""go with."" What horror film doesn't?But - I've certainly seen worse thriller/horror type movies. I've even seen worse M. Night movies. This is the best from him in years. The acting was decent and the characters seemed real and flawed. The story was intriguing and it kept you guessing. Just when it seemed like it might be getting long, it was over. Not my favorite movie, but certainly not as bad as people are panning it.

196,alexcomputerkid,The Visit is mind-blowing for all the wrong reasons.,1,2 September 2015,"At two different screenings, I had two good conversations with a good guy about the strangeness of M. Night Shyamalan's career. His first mainstream films Sixth Sense and Unbreakable really both dealt with mental issues and powers in a powerful way. We also can't forgot the famous Newsweek magazine proclaiming Shyamalan as ""The Next Spielberg"" which now just looks foolish. With Signs coming in 2002 from him and The Village in 2004, both reached a level of strangeness that I wasn't fully into and this wasn't on the same as level Sixth Sense or Unbreakable surely. Still I support these movies more than most people. It's really his films Lady in the Water in 2006 or The Happening in 2008 where I got off the Shyamalan train. Both suffer from using stars like Bryce Dallas Howard and Mark Wahlberg improperly and I still say The Happening has one of the worst twists ever. It's just hard to believe a guy can create some of the most interesting films around and also some of the biggest disasters. His new film The Visit is mind-blowing for all the wrong reasons.A middle age mother (Kathryn Hahn) has a falling out with her parents with no contact with them and after she has two kids of her own, she decides to send Rebecca (Olivia De Jonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) to finally meet their grandparents for the first time. Once they get there, these are not the grandparents we expected.The point Shyamalan is really trying to make is that going to your grandparents house is not usually an exciting experience. Rebecca is an inspiring filmmaker who brings the nicest cameras to document her experience which just sounds like the dullest film you could put together. The film wants to evoke some humor by Tyler who is really the typical mischievous little brother character and he's also an inspiring rapper. Acting by both of them is surely not an issue but still nothing special nor do they make their characters likable. The writing has humor in it which really makes you question the direction to the film because it's not at all marketed as a horror comedy. Even though it is marketed as a horror film, it does not have enough killers or a lot of horror elements. The movie just seems lost on direction and it's off-putting as to it's tone through every act.The grandparents are the main asset to the plot but they are also the biggest downfall. Again, the acting by Deanna Dungan as Doris Jamison and Peter McRobbie as John Jamison are not an issue but the script is a problem. There is a scene with some really bad nudity and my friend said sitting next to me ""That wasn't eye candy."" They are basically old people who don't do a lot of anything and for some reason the idea of pooping (yes) is a plot point to them which just falls back to the bad direction. Once you get to the twist which is really uninteresting and pretty basic, many plot holes comes into place. It's never good when you have so many questions after a film like this one.For a story using found footage and using pretty much one setting, location should be somewhat important you would think. It's an old house and the characters only venture out into town rarely. These kids must be so bored in this house! By what the twist is though, so much more could be done with the characters outside of the house. This twist is made to have somewhat of an investigation type plot and could introduce more characters which is another thing it's needs but when you only have a budget of five million, money has to play a factor somehow.Even with The Visit being a screening, the audience I sat with has some strong reactions to how tiresome this movie was. Guys beyond me were bashing the movie right from the beginning. My friend whispered ""We are not even an hour into this"" and ""This really needs to be over."" People two rows in front of us picked up the twist very early on and some people left early. Sure, this wasn't a well-behaved audience but they all gave an accurate reaction to this movie. We were all pretty much done with this very early into it.M. Night Shyamalan has now hit a bottom that I thought he had already reached. The Visit has really some nice ideas and has the plot to be scary but the results are not there and the movie is ludicrous. With that small budget, The Visit is surely going to make back it's money but this should be on the list of the worst films of the year. Actually it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is surely the worst for Shyamalan to date. It is just basically the worst at everything.",The Visit
197,Krackoon,Where's the twist?,4,26 September 2015,"So, when watching M. Night Shyamalan films, I've come to expect the worst, but he always manages to surprise me with his mind numbingly stupid twists. They're always good for a laugh or two.'The Visit' misses the mark on every level. You have two children going to visit their grandparents - and due to no visual confirmation between their mother and her parents, whom she hasn't spoken with for 15 years, you can pretty much guess where things are heading 10 minutes into the film. At least I hope you can, so nothing like this happens to you down the road. This plot hole is not only completely ridiculous, but a complete killer. At least for me, since I continued watching, expecting an actual twist. You know, I was expecting M. Night Shyamalan shenanigans. He seems like an intelligent guy, the problem is, he thinks the rest of us are drooling idiots.Okay, so the ''twist'' didn't live up to expectations - what about the rest of the film? That really IS the entire film. Two highly annoying, somewhat intelligent kids, putting everything together - everything but the stupid plot hole. Oh, and one annoying mother, who sends her children away to stay with people she hasn't seen or spoken with for over 15 years with no visual confirmation, no phone contact, no photos, nada. We also learn that one of her parents was somewhat abusive, which just makes the story even less believable. Oh, and before I go - Kathryn Hahn is terrible. Random Ramblings of a Madman: M. Night Shyamalan is back? Thanks for the warning.",The Visit
198,michael-3204,Getting old is scary!,6,17 July 2016,"Decent psychological horror with body horror flourishes that focuses on the more disturbing effects of aging, as seen through the eyes of two teenagers who visit their estranged grandparents in rural Pennsylvania. As has often been the case with director and writer M. Night Shyamalan's other work, there is a lot of contrivance to the set-up. The situation is believable enough to go with, largely due to an excellent cast's ability to pave over the things that might otherwise make you go ""Hmmm..."".This is not, strictly speaking, another ""found footage"" film because the footage was never purportedly lost, but the conceit is that all the footage we're viewing is shot by the older of the two teens, played by Olivia De Jonge, assisted by her younger brother, played by Ed Oxenbould. I thought I never wanted to see another movie supposedly filmed-on-a-hand-held-by-a-character. In this case, the conceit is effectively utilized as an integral element of the story rather than a gimmick, and sometimes as a slightly wry meta- commentary on the film-making process. Inevitably, there are scenes that made me wonder whether anyone in their right mind really would keep filming through the action, but this isn't as big an issue here as it often is with this conceit.What works really well and makes this worth watching is the subtle weaving together and ultimately the unraveling of rationalizations people employ to explain things that don't seem kosher, even as events get stranger and stranger. The film makes a good showing of how and why people can make some of the seemingly dumb choices they make, and in that sense offers something of a meta-commentary on a common trope horror movies are often faulted for. If the whole thing is a little too contrived to be truly disturbing and profound, and the conclusion a little too neatly wrapped up, it is nevertheless a unique and engaging watch.",The Visit
199,keithlovesmovies,The Visit Review,8,23 September 2015,"Becca and her younger brother Tyler (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) say goodbye to her single mother (Kathryn Hahn) as they board a train and head to Pennsylvania to meet their grandparents for the first time while she goes on a cruise with her boyfriend Miguel (Jorge Cordova). Welcomed by their grandmother (Deanna Dunagan) and their grandfather (Peter McRobbie), all is fine until both children notice that their seemingly innocent grandparents begin to behave strangely. Once both children discover a dangerous secret, they must now wonder if they can make it out alive.I will start off by saying do not dismiss this film just because it's a M. Night Shyamalan film. Sure his last few films have been terrible (or so I've heard, I haven't seen them personally) but this one is actually good. First of all, I liked the story. Didn't really care too much about the fact the mom is divorced and there's no dad. I would have liked to learn more about the backstory between the mom and the grandparents but I didn't mind too much because it was better that they were a little mysterious. I'm not going to say much more other than to expect a twist. I don't think I'm surprising anyone with this considering that it is a M. Night Shyamalan film. Even after watching the film, I went back through it and there are clues to what happens later on. My favorite part of the film happens to be the performances of Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie as the grandparents with Dunagan stealing the show as Nana(grandmother). I thought that they were both able to portray the right amount of caring innocence and creepiness. Both children were great as well as they were still being kids but they were smart characters and that they had some great one-liners. The sad thing about that was that most of the one-liners, although sometimes funny, were at the expense of making fun of old people and all of their intricacies. I laughed at the first ones but then it started getting old. I thought the performances were elevated thanks to the script as the conversations between the brother and sister felt real and natural as did that with the grandparents. There was good chemistry all around even with Kathryn Hahn as their mother who was good despite not getting to see her too much. This film has been advertised as a horror film but I didn't really see that. I thought it was more of a suspense/comedy film. Where the suspense comes from the viewer waiting to figure out what is wrong with the grandparents and what are their true intentions and the comedy comes from how the children and us, to a lesser extent, try to go about doing it. I think they did a great job at both. I just wish they took a few more liberties with the story to make it scarier. While watching the film, there were a few moments that could have gone differently. This won't spoil anything since it was in the trailer but when the grandmother asks the girl to go inside the oven to clean it, she can lock her in and turn it on. Overall, I came into this with low expectations and came out pleasantly surprised and entertained. If you give chance, maybe you will be too.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com",The Visit

I was completely frightened the entire film and ultimately impressed with a plot unlike any other horror film these days. The idea behind it was fantastic and really set it up to be a great success.

201,jackbanister16,M. Night is making a comeback.,8,8 October 2015,"I went into this movie knowing nothing about the film so when I saw, ""an M. Night Shyamalan film,"" I let out a frustrating sigh having been disappointed by him for years. This movie was different though. There are no viral outbreaks, no creatures chasing Will Smith, and no air benders. It's simply two kids visiting their grandparents while their single mother goes on vacation. I've noticed that M. Night does his best work when he puts the focus on ONE main story and lets the other dynamics and plots unfold around that story. In Signs, he focused on Mel Gibson's crumbling family life with an alien invasion as a backdrop. In this film, he puts the focus on the two children's relationship and lets the rest of the film follow suit. Anywho, enough about that.This movie has the essential elements of a creepy movie. House in the middle of the woods, crazy lunatics for grandparents, and a couple of tech savvy teenagers.The film is shot in found footage style which has definitely been done to death, but is not ""in your face"" in this movie. M. Night cleverly writes the teenage girl in the movie as a film buff who focuses on cinematography and ""setting the mood,"" which allows him to use depth of field, good lighting, and good framing unlike other FF style movies like Paranormal Activity, etc which are more jumpy and gopro-ish. The visuals and camera work are refreshingly crisp and smooth, given the method of filmingFrom day one, you can tell that something isn't right with the grandparents and the kids decide to set up cameras and capture the action. Long story short, things get crazy. The most surprising thing about this film is how naturally comedy, suspense, and overt horror are blended together. Nothing really felt forced or unnatural in acting, pace, or action. At some points the horror felt a little campy, but that can't really be avoided with so much humor in the movie and most of the people I saw the movie with were cool with that. Looking back on it, the twists were somewhat predictable but at the time I was so engrossed with the movie I didn't even notice the plot twist creep up.Great movie and I really hope M.

203,dhainline1,No One Loves You Like Your Grandparents!,10,15 September 2015,"The new M. Night Shyamalan movie ""The Visit"" is unique in that it combines horror with comedy effortlessly! A single mother named Paula Jamison(Kathryn Hahn) with 2 teen kids, 15-year-old Rebecca ""Becca""(Olivia DeJonge) and 13-year-old Tyler(Ed Oxenbould) is in a new relationship with a guy named Miguel. Becca and Tyler want their mom to have this relationship work out because the marriage she had with their father ended in divorce. Becca wants to have an extended family that gets along. Paula had a falling out with her parents 15 years earlier when she was 19. She ran off and married her teacher who became Becca and Tyler's father. Becca and Tyler never saw their grandparents either maternal or paternal because of this falling out. Becca is an aspiring filmmaker who talks about nuances and other parts of film while her younger brother is a wannabee raper. Both kids are pretty precocious. Becca is so serious about her craft she tells Tyler not to fool around with his rap music while she films him. Becca has a new project in mind. Her mother's parents have contacted Paula online with the desire to see their grandchildren. Paula is reluctant to let the kids stay with their grandparents while she goes on a cruise with Miguel. Becca and Tyler want to see the grandparents they never met before. The grandparents live on a farm in Pennsylvania and are retired. They spend their free time volunteering at a mental hospital, Meadow Shade.The kids take a train to Pennsylvania and their mother goes on her cruiseafter sending them off. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop-Pop (Peter McRobbie) show up with a sign that says ""Becca & Tyler"" and homemade pretzels. Tyler raps for his new grandmother about pineapple upside cake. Becca talks about her new movie she wants to make about the visit with Nana and Pop-Pop. The first day goes by uneventfully. The rest ofthe week is another story entirely! Becca and Tyler discover their grandmother getting up at night to claw the walls while naked or vomiting. Pop-Pop says she has a form of dementia called ""sundowning."" Basically, Nana goes crazy during the night at 9:30 and he tells the kids not to leave their room at that time. Her craziness doesn't stop in the daytime. A game of hide and seek under the porch with their grandmother turns scary for the kids. She seems to be stalking them under the porch. She follows the kids and walks away from them with her dress riding up and no underwear. Pop-Pop is also acting weird and he is paranoid about strangers and is incontinent and keeping dirty diapers in the shed he doesn't want the kids to go into. The basement is also off-limits to the kids because of the mold. Into all this craziness, a man from Meadow Shade comes to the house and asks about Nana and Pop-Pop. The grandparents are conveniently taking a walk and haven't been volunteering lately. Tyler is also making fun of Nana's nighttime excursions. He is quite funny with the imitations! Tyler also will not quote normal swear words and he says he will use the names of female pop stars instead (i.e., Sarah McClaughlin when he sees the dirty diapers, Katy Perry when Nana gets crazy). Becca and Tyler skype Paula on her trip and tell her all that has been happening with their grandparents. Paula says her parents were crazy when she was young and Nana used to sunbathe naked in the yard. Nana apologizes to Becca for spilling dough on the computer because this blocks the kids from seeing their mother. Nana also goes all-out crazy when Becca asks her why the falling out with Paula happened 15 years earlier. Another visitor fromMeadow Shade comes. She is a young woman named Stacy who has a blueberry pie for Nana and Pop-Pop. Stacy says she is grateful to them for counseling her. At the end of the week, Stacy comes back and confronts Nana and Pop-Pop in the yard. The computer is cleaned off and Paula can see the kids. Tyler holds up the computer to the window and the huge reveal comes up---NANA AND POP-P0P ARE NOT THE REAL GRANDPARENTS! The two people Becca and Tyler are staying with were residents of the Meadow Shade! They escaped, killed the biological grandparents, and took on the identities of their victims. Becca finds the dead bodies of her real grandparents in the basement and pictures of them with the impostors. She and Tyler kill the impostors and escape to the police and their mother. This was the funniest, most suspenseful of all M. Night Shyamalan movies! All the characters, especially the fake grandparents were really great! Deana Dunigan as Nana could turn on a dime from kindly grandmother to crazy old lady and Peter McRobbie was quite excellent as Pop-Pop.

First off... it's supposed to be POV filmed by a couple of kids... yet often looks like full on Hollywood production. No cheapy cameras and the nature of the editing just wreck that premise. So why bother? Second, the kids are just annoying as hell... the boy wrapper and his sister that talks like an NYU film student... why couldn't they be normal kids instead of these mutants that I felt no familiarity with or sympathy for? Third, the whole setup is insulting to old people and folks with mental illness... 'oooh! Old people are creepy and weird.... oooh! Crazy people are homicidal!' I'm not why this bothered me so much here but it did... it just seemed lazy. Fourth, the shmaltzy 'message' at the end of the movie. Shymalan has always had this shallow moralizing to some extent in his films... and it's always fallen flat when I've noticed it... felt tacked on. I'd give the guy a fair chance if the movie was decent... but it's far from good and continues his streak of making strangely awful movies.",The Visit

It was really, really good movie! Something similar of The Taking of Deborah Logan (2014), but by way DL is still creepier. The Visit is so scary, creepy, shocking, dark, little disturbing and funny. It's about two young children who they went to visit grandma and grandfather that they have never seen them. Grandparents were really behaved so strangely. You could get shocked if you discover their private life or things. First third of the movie was so creepy, chocking and it was very dark! And again it was really good, the only thing that grandma should to fix own character to be more creepy as crazy grandma from Deborah Logan, but anyway she was also good in the movie.

Well, the performances are terrific especially by Nana. Even Pop Pop gets his act right to shake you up.

Many of this director's movies are incorrectly advertised as being part of such or such genres while they are not. ""The Visit"" is obviously not a horror movie and this very faulty categorisation explains why many people downvoted it.
""The Visit"" is at best a drama or a thriller and, even considered as such, is not so good.",The Visit
211,kalibeans,The Night of Signs shines in The Visit,8,12 September 2015,"What a truly enjoyable movie-going experience (except for the teenage girl behind me who kicked my seat every time she screamed). I have not experienced an audience laugh out loud so much or scream out loud so much in a long, long time. The Visit had the potential to be a truly horrifying experience. Night expertly takes the audiences hand (grips it with a vice like strength) and drags you through each twist and turn. He gives you time to laugh and then scares the laugh right out of you. The Visit incorporates what I love best about Night's excellent storytelling - an element of redemption, reminding the audience of some of life's more important lessons. Thus relieving you of having to have it be unbearably terrifying. A huge nod to the two young actors who were magnificent in this film. Thank you! You both did an incredible job!! We are returned once again to the confines of one family, one house, one memorable week, one marvelous Night experience. I loved it. Well done Night! Well done!!!",The Visit

At first, everything is great, but when night comes...really weird things start to happen. Although the story is simple, and there is nothing earth-shattering here, it works just fine. Character's self-filmed movies, like this one, don't always work, but this was done in a clever way, with angles and shots that shine more often than not. The acting was good, even the sometimes grating Oxenbould playing Tyler. Deanna Dunagan plays up the scenes surprisingly well.Creepy, funny and with a neat twist.

I loved that there was a writer/director who came onto the scene and was suddenly unbelievable. I was ready to sit and watch everything he did, I was ready to sit and wait eagerly for the next release. To me he was like a hero.But it all vanished. The village was okay, but not really great in comparison the what went before. Lady in the water, The happening, Devil? For me it just disappeared with disappointment.This though...This is close to what I was wanting.This is great.We're back to really well thought out scenes. We're back to the slow suspense. I'd almost forgot how well Shyamalan worked at directing children, he's great at it and it always stands out.Please do more like this!!",The Visit
214,kimheniadis,Looks like Shyamalan has found his story telling voice again.,8,19 February 2016,"When you begin your career with a movie like The Sixth Sense, so much is expected of you. When your films start to decline, and then not do well at all, it's easy for people to lose faith in your talents. I'll admit, after The Village, I thought Shyamalan may have run out of things I would enjoy watching. I am happy that The Visit has restored my opinion of his movies. Hopefully he can keep it up!Shyamalan did an excellent job of keeping the tension going throughout the movie. Weird things start happening the first night, and at first it's easy for the grandparents to just say it's old age. But after a few days, both of the kids really start to question it. The sister can still justify things, but the brother starts to get really creeped out. When I saw the previews I thought this was going to be a found footage film, and those are one of my least favorite type of movies. So I was happy to find out it wasn't. The sister is making a documentary, so there are times when we are seeing the scene through the camera lens, but it really works for this film. Besides the ""amateur"" camera work, the camera angles in the film really help with capturing the tension.Often I figure out the twist in a book or movie, well before the ending, but not in this case. Because of that, it made this movie even more enjoyable to me. I figured it out about a minute before the brother and sister did, so Shyamalan did a marvelous job in the script writing. Oh, and the one scene at the end (you'll know which one), really, really grossed me out. But that just added another element to this movie to make it even more enjoyable.If you liked Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs or The Village, I think you'll enjoy The Visit.",The Visit
215,AliceofX,Decently Good,6,15 September 2015,"I now wonder what to compare The Visit with. If you look back to Shyamalan's earlier masterpieces The Visit seems sub-par. If you look at the last seven years of his career this film looks like a welcome return to decency.The Visit is by no means a great film, and it is not as smart as, say, The Conjuring was. But the only thing I found bad about it was the predictable ending. Other than that The Visit is a perfectly good horror film. It was scary in all the right ways, weird without being too unrealistic.The characters were good and the film had nice drama. Deanna Dunagan, who played Nana, was my personal favourite in this film. The biggest source of tension in the story is the uncertainty felt by the two children. At one point their grandparents seem completely normal, then they switch between confused or violent. You really don't know what to expect and it creates a great mood for the film.As for more spoiler filled details what I really didn't like was how at the end of the film the sad, dramatic mood was utterly ruined by the humorous rap part. It completely killed the atmosphere and just seemed very amateurish. And what was with the Hansel and Gretel themes? It seemed like they would go somewhere, but they never do?Overall I would say The Visit is average, but far from bad.",The Visit

217,peterkowalski,Not for everyone.,8,25 November 2015,"Some people has dubbed ""The Visit"" as the grand return of M. Night Shyamalan - it's hard to even review a title of his without dipping into his less than fortunate release history of the past recent years - but the truth is, The Visit is not his return, nor it is his finest hour. It is, however, a surprisingly entertaining mix of creepy, funny, and insightful. And it's not for everyone. But if you're smart enough to keep your eyes opened, you will get the joke.The story here is Becca and Tyler's - aged 12 and 8, respectively - who are on their way to meet their grandparents, whom they've never met due to a big fight her mother had with her parents before the kids were born. The cookie-cutter grandparents - named here as Nana and Pop-Pop - are just as you'd expect - typical American, warm and a bit quirky. Oh yes, the big thing is that Becca is making a documentary of the whole trip, something she hopes will be, as she calls it, an elixir to mend the broken relationship between her mother and her parents.Almost right off the bat, things get real weird. Tyler - a typical 8-year-old womanizer with the self esteem of Kanye West (and rapping skills not far off him) may provide the comical relief in the movie and be the source of all good jokes, but he's also the first one who smells a rat. Becca, on the other hand, a mature, educated and patient little lady, is more prone to write off all weirdness happening to their grandparents as sad acts of getting old. Her mother shares her theory during one of the Skype sessions.But the weird things get more and more frequent and more and more undeniable. As soon as the kids find an explanation for one thing, two other pop up, and by the end of the trip, the kids are ready to go home, which is, as you would probably guess, where everything gets from bad to worse.Shyamalan is smart about things. He mixes all kinds of clichés and inspirations from all kinds of places - there's a nod to Psycho, to Halloween, Paranormal Activity, and Becca's found-footage-first-person-view-filming style is an obvious reference to the Blair Witch Project. The grandparents' names are also a nod to classic-American family, and as we go along, you become more aware of those references, but they do not feel forced nor overused. Maybe because they really aren't - Shyamalan uses them with great restriction, and smartly shifts the mood from scary to funny to nostalgic to creepy again. It's all organic and natural, mature and fluid. The trick is - no expectations. If you live with the notion ""The Visit"" is just another ""The Village"" or ""Sixth Sense"" yes - you will be greatly disappointed. And you really shouldn't be: ""The Visit"" is a tasty piece of cinema, by all means not a return of the director, but a more distinct and mature direction.",The Visit
218,objviewer,Predictable hodgepodge,1,17 October 2019,"If a movie has some redeemable or interesting quality I never give 1 star - and this movie does have those. But I just find it so mean-spirited and even cruel to base horror on mental illness and senility that I wish I could give this a zero.But put that aside. Shyamalan is a good director but a lousy screen writer. Wish he would direct others' screenplays. I saw the predictable ""twist"" in this from the beginning (yawn). Shyamalan may be good at directing kids, but the dialogue he writes for them is either too cutesy or too adult.As for the plot, too much to go through all the plot points that make no sense (characters that appear, seem to have some role, but are never seen again). But the glaring fault is what evidently is the Shyamalan story telling gimmick: Mix a pop-psychology attempt at insight into family dynamics, you know to try and make the movie kind of deep, with a horror theme with scary bumps and shocks. This messy hodgepodge completely crumbles at the schlocky nonsensical horror end, followed by another attempt at hallmark card sensitive relationship theorizing.Really wish this guy would direct someone else's screenplay.",The Visit
219,tlooknbill,"Genuinely funny, scary & original portrayal of how high tech kids see the elderly",10,18 September 2015,"This movie was so much fun because it got me to relate how as a child I had to use humor with my siblings to deal with some of our elderly relatives who were not all there and had developed some strange habits and behaviors that made it difficult to determine motive and intent and whether we should consider ourselves in danger.Very good child actors with realistic and well grounded persona's convey this same fear & doubt in dealing as respectfully as they possibly can with downright disturbing (potentially dangerous) behaviors from their grandparents they're visiting for the first time.Probably the most original movie I've seen this year considering it borrows from the live camera view techniques of ""Paranormal Activity"" only with much better actors that convincingly put you right in the middle of it like no other movie of its kind where the audience literally sees through a child's perspective. And we all know how frightening that can be.I can tell you for sure I've never laughed so hard at something so disturbing and scary in any movie. I got a sort of ""Abbott & Costello Meet The Wolfman"" vibe only the scary parts are WAY MORE SCARY and realistic and the humor is as you'ld expect from tech savvy, video game playing, wise-cracking kids.

220,yespat,Really Good Except For The Ending,6,13 July 2019,"I found myself glued to the movie, surprised that the director finally might just have made a good movie after all these years. The suspense was real and at times too much for me. No fault there. The problem I had came late. It seemed to me like they ran out of money at the last moment and just slapped on an ending to finish. They never explained what exactly happened to both sets of old people and how one set came to live in the house and who they really were. Then there was a female visitor the kids met earlier in the film who was seen arguing with them, then the kids made a comment about how they never saw her leave but this too was never explained.Had these loose ends been tied up satisfactorily I would have given the film a 9. The ending just felt tacked on with none of the mystery explained. Before that though, there was an entertainingly tense thriller that was surprisingly good,",The Visit

Two hours later, it was oddly satisfying to finish the movie.The genius of this movie is that it balances real horror with tongue in check humor well. The characters are also very well played. The two kids have chemistry together and act as real siblings.For me, this was like a grown up version of Scooby Doo. It will not scare you as ""IT"", nor it will entertain you as a full blown comedy movie, but for what it wants to be, it is good. It is definitely better than many +100.000.000 USD blockbusters I've seen lately or even many similar horror movies.Watch it and don't worry about the snobs posting 1 / 10 reviews.",The Visit
222,anthonymichaelbangert,Shyamalan is Almost Back,5,11 September 2015,"The Visit is M. Night Shamalamadingdong's latest piece. It is a found footage film about two kids going to meet their grandparents for the first time. It explains the Found Footage by making the girl an aspiring film maker putting together a documentary on the trip. While there the grandparents start acting creepy, and things get scarier and scarier. So, cool, everyone is praising Shyamalalalala on ""returning to form,"" and in certain ways he has. He made something that I think compares best to Signs. It wasn't fantastic. But it had certain cool elements. Lets talk about what didn't work. Shamama's twist is known to be in every film. In this, you can see it coming from a mile away. The film gives too many clues too early on and it is very easy to piece together from there. The ""documentary"" feel is cool, but no 14 year old girl is going to have 2-3 different angled shots set up while in some of the shots (especially in the third act) is going down. They try to explain this away with having the brother doing some of it, but it still doesn't feel real, it feels too professional. And lets talk about one more thing I hated: this movie had jump scares. And they don't make sense within the film. The jump scares come from the actors doing things that don't make sense and feel staged. They don't feel organic with the rest of the film. With that being said, there are some praises I need to give this film. First, it is definitely Shahamanahamana best film in years. He gave fans what they have wanted for a while: a stripped down, real version of himself, without all the ego. He even went so far as to parody himself within the film. He actually wrote in things about trying to film stupid things for aesthetic, or random music that doesn't fit the film for ""artistic reasons,"" and just random cinematography bull. It was nice for him to realize who he was and be able to make fun of that in a way. Next, I want to praise the child actors. These kids were pretty fantastic most of the time. I wont spoil anything but I will say there is a fantastic scene in this film where raw emotion comes through, and these kids show they have a future in Hollywood. And finally, I want to praise this movie's comedy. This film is not a horror. It is a Horror/comedy and the comedy is great. It works right where it needs to in a good way. Is this Shazamala's best work? No! This is just another one of his shitty films. But it did show potential for him to start to grow again. I would give this film a 5/10",The Visit
223,ryanmark-57919,Shyamalan Can Still Make Good Movies,7,14 September 2015,"Man, I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed and I actually came out impressed. I'm usually pretty open-minded when it comes to most films but I thought this movie would be horrible as soon as I heard the name of M. Knight Shyamalan. I don't know if it's because my expectations were so low or what but I really enjoyed this movie. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but it's decent and that's more than I can say for many of Shyamalan's recent work. Let's talk about the story.This film revolves around two children named Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and their first trip to see their grandparents. Their mother (Kathryn Hahn) had a bad fight with her grandparents when she was younger so she didn't have anything to do with them for most of her life. This means that the younguns also didn't have anything to do with them either. However, she's finally making up with her parents and sending her children to go visit them. The children start their visit innocently enough but they soon find out that something is seriously wrong with these people and old age isn't the primary explanation.There are a few recognizable faces here but these definitely aren't popular actors in this movie. However, that actually kind of helps the movie since I wasn't distracted by known actors pretending like their trying to make a documentary. DeJonge and Oxenbould both do a great job with their characters and they seem like kids that I've met before. That really shouldn't be difficult since children are all over the place but it's nice not to see them act too ""childlike"". I did find myself cringing some when Oxenbould started his little rap songs but they didn't take up very much time. I was really surprised to see how creepy the grandparents were. Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie play the the grandparents and right off the bat you can tell that something isn't quite right about them. It starts off subtle but things get really crazy pretty quickly. I laughed at the idea of scary old people but these two really are unnerving. It's also nice to see Kathryn Hahn in this kind of movie. I can't help but smile whenever she's on screen. Her enthusiasm is contagious.This movie does a lot right that many of Shyamalan's movies have been missing for a while. The dialogue between the characters is surprisingly natural and reminded me of conversations I've had with my own family at times. The characters were interesting and the scary parts were actually scary. The grandparents do a great job of unnerving us but I have to admit that the house and the country around them also help to make everything feel not quite right. It's not a scary house by itself but it comes off scarier thanks to the weirdness going on inside. Unfortunately, the film still has a few parts that made me cringe a little.Let me get this right out of the way. I can't handle seeing little kids rapping. He doesn't rap often but I think I almost audibly groaned every time Oxenbould did a little rap song. I'm guessing it's supposed to be cute but it didn't work on my iron heart. There's also a lesson trying to be taught to us throughout the film about letting go of your anger and forgiving those closest to you but it honestly felt a bit too forced to me. The children have some problems with their own father since he left them when they were still fairly young but it just comes in at awkward times throughout the film and then we get back to weird grandparents again. The only other thing that kind of bothered me was how easy the twist was to figure out. I knew what was really happening about fifteen minutes into the film. It didn't take any of my enjoyment away but it does surprise me to so easily predict a Shyamalan twist.Overall, I was really impressed that the movie was actually enjoyable and turned out to be decent. There are a few hiccups here and there but it felt like a great movie simply because my expectations were so low. It's nice to see that Shyamalan can still make good films. I can't help but wonder how closely the studio kept a rein on some of Shyamalan's crazier tendencies.",The Visit

225,TheBarleyGuy,I just... I hate this movie.,3,18 December 2015,"The little white boy raps, and the ""grandparents"" are actually escaped mental patients who murdered the real grandparents. There. F**k this movie. It's The Visit.A single mother finds that things in her family's life go very wrong after her two young children visit their grandparents.I'd heard just about every bad thing that you can hear about a movie. Including Your Movie Sucks referring to the movie as ""worse than cancer"", and so armed with that and my general expectation that an M. Night Shyamalan movie isn't going to be very good, I had a feeling that I knew what I was getting myself into. However, when at the 6 minute mark I actually heard this little kid actor start rapping, I knew I was in deep s**t.Now, this movie has been labeled as Fresh at 61% by Rotten Tomatoes, placing itself next to Chronicle, which somehow still has 85%, as proof that RT is useless and garbage. I have a feeling that the positive reviews for this movie are coming from it's ending having a pretty gross moment where an old man rubs his s**t in a child's face, but this moment is so unearned and foreshadowed that it loses all of it's impact. The kid is set up at the beginning as being a huge germophobe who then stumbles across a pile of used adult diapers in a shed. The math is there, and it's bullshit. That's not to say that the movie is shot incompetently, they've obviously given M. Night a fair bit of money to make this movie, which he bizarrely put into shooting it, despite it being a found-footage movie, all ""filmed"" by a 15 year old girl.The Visit is so absolutely f**king obnoxious that it honestly makes me angry just sitting here and writing about it. It's listed as a horror-comedy, but none of the jokes are funny and all the horror elements are f**king ridiculous. Coupled with the fact that every word out of both children's mouth nearly made we turn the movie off, it's a really hard watch, bordering on an endurance test.You have to deal with the 13 year old rapper, who uses slang I have never heard in my whole f**king life, like telling his mother he is ""on the text"" with two girls, and rapping about hoes to his grandmother, and on the other hand you have his 15 year old sister who fancies herself the second coming of Documentarian Christ, and has dialogue that feels like it was written by a grown man, rather than said by a teenager. I'm not saying that teenagers aren't bright, they really are, but when I have to hear a 15 year old girl talk about her grandparent's ""proclivities"" it starts to feel a little disingenuous.The movie even falls flat in it's premise, I understand that the mother of our two 'heroes' hasn't seen her parents in a while, but the idea that she would ship her children off to stay with adults who are essentially strangers without at least seeing them safely into the arms of these people just doesn't make sense to me. You could argue that ""Without that, there's no movie"" but that's just the problem. There should be no f**king movie.All in all, this is not some second coming of M. Night Shyamalan, it's an obnoxious, grating, waste of time that I do not recommend in the slightest. Being well shot, and not looking like it was made by the worst kind of film student does not make a movie good or watchable, and this is the proof of that.

A lot of creepy moments are to be found in this movie and the acting of the grandparents is really impressive. I do hate the role of Tyler though, simply because I never ever would approve of anyone feeling the urge to rap. This is basically the only really annoying part and the movie would be so much better without this gimmick. Especially because this kid is not even close to being good or unique. It is not even that much about the acting but the question: What if this kind of scenario would happen to me, my kids, or close friends?

I did enjoy The Village, which I thought was clever although somewhat outlandish in its premise. Compared to those movies (I haven't seen Shyamalan's others) this movie is sort of old-fashioned, but that's what makes it good. It's just basic suspense/horror film-making, with a good cast and characters that are just off-beat enough to be interesting while being believable. It's also funny, although I would not call it a comedy. Movies like this illustrate that you don't need special effects or stars to make a good movie. In fact some movies are better off without them.",The Visit
228,Parks,Grimm in a Good Way,6,14 January 2016,"I can understand the mix of love & hate for this film. There are some really jarring and disappointing things about it, which may prevent enjoyment of the film as a whole. My primary issue with the film is that is is yet another found footage film. Worse, it lazily doesn't even try to answer the problem with that genre - the ""why are they still filming this?"" issue. It's particularly noticeable in the scenes where Becca is in jeopardy - yet still filming herself in the mirror rather than looking for danger. Is she supposed to be THAT self-obsessed?If you're able to get past that, and a number of other parts of the story where the characters behave completely illogically (JUST RUN AWAAAYY!!!) for plot purposes then you might be able to enjoy the film. For the most part I liked it for the creepy atmosphere and the way is slowly ramps up the tension. Also, it's one of the few movies I've seen to take the real issue of dementia and just push it a little further to take it into the realms of horror. Of course it doesn't match the classic ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" which this film could have done to take a few lessons from.On the whole, I'd say I enjoyed it more than I didn't enjoy it. Yes, the child actors sound like 30 year olds but they are likable for the most part. Agreed the rapping is cringeworthy but I think it's supposed to be (at least I hope so). MNS has said he intended the film to be more of a comedy than a horror, so if you are a horror fan you should expect him to back away from true horror and more toward ""tension"" in the final act. But it IS pretty tense, and I have to give all concerned credit for that.As for the pointless ""We've all learned something from this, and everything is fine"" conclusion (no PTSD here!) you could honestly skip this section of the film altogether and not feel cheated.",The Visit

The most major thing that annoyed me is the flippy, bouncy camera work. Most of us have seen Paranormal Activity, and in my mind this movie is nothing but a bigger budget version of that film. Only PA had me sitting on the edge of my seat all the way through, while Visit only had 3 or 4 moments like that. Acting was bad. Characters are not likable. Lots of errors.

Although I don't like found footage movies, I found ""The Visit"" quite refreshing as it wasn't filled with all of the,shaky camera shots like other found footage movies, it has quite a few scenes where I jumped in terror, the build up to the real ""mystery"" was great and most of all, it was hilarious! Along with found footage, I hate comedy horrors, but this movie had the right amount of comedy thanks to the young man who plays the brother in this movie. I look forward to seeing him in more movies! I rated it a 9 because it not only exceeded my expectations in watching something that was scary but the twist was awesome! I'd definitely recommend you see this movie!",The Visit

232,IheartCali5882,Shyamalan has (partially) redeemed himself. A respectable comeback of a film.,7,13 September 2015,"The Visit - 7/10 Shyamalan has moderately redeemed himself after a series of disasters. It's more thriller/comedy than horror but there are a handful of genuinely creepy scenes. Slow pacing, but the tone that something is very ""off"" makes the film interesting even while nothing is actually occurring. In that aspect (and only that aspect) it reminded me of Rosemary's Baby. Both directors managed to load seemingly harmless events with tension and foreboding. That's the part I appreciated the most. I also appreciated that the twist this time wasn't something totally off the wall, i.e. he didn't try to hard. It was a perfectly respectable twist within the realm of normalcy while still being slightly shocking. The only negatives are that it's got slow pacing in the first act, but it does pick up considerably about 30-40 minutes in. Also the found footage gimmick is beyond tired at this point, but the utilization of it is slightly smarter than some other films I can recall.Bonus points for the funny as hell son Ed Oxenbould. Aside from the seriously creepy grandparents he makes the film. The daughter is a decent actress as well , but the son got all of the funny material. All in all Shyamalan has nothing to be ashamed of this time around. I may just go and see it again .",The Visit

234,brandon_veracka,Shyamalan's Worst Film to Date,2,16 May 2018,"When I saw M. Night Shyamalama-ding-dong's name in the opening credits, I knew I had to take whatever was coming next with a grain of salt. However, I didn't expect to need the whole salt shaker. Truthfully, I wasn't expecting this movie to be THAT bad, but it is. ""The Visit"" is a new low for Shyamalan; embarrassingly bad, and bordering on unwatchable. It's one of those movies where you look at the time several times throughout, and by the time the credits are rolling, you want your time back-assuming you make it that far. This movie takes a few common horror tropes and mixes them together. It tells a very simple story-which needlessly drags its feet at times-from the viewpoint of two young teenage kids who are brother and sister. These two siblings go to visit their grandparents and things start getting weird-not an awful premise for a horror flick. It's not the concept that's bad, it's everything else (and I mean everything). There isn't a single shred of quality film making in this mess, and ironically, the lead protagonist is an aspiring film maker. The cherry atop this crap-cake is that it's ALL shot with handheld cameras, so you get a full 94 minutes of shaky camera time. It's a head-scratching-ly poor choice of style for a seasoned producer like Shyamalan.Maybe if I was still a kid and wanted a ""scary movie"" with some very mild horror and gross-out elements, then MAYBE I would've found this entertaining. Alas, I'm not, and if you're anywhere north of sixteen, then you probably want to watch a real movie that'll actually entertain you. To put it simply; steer clear of this abomination. The only terror you'll feel is the horror of never getting that hour and a half back.",The Visit

The trailer gives off this 'cool' horror air to it; crazed, psychotic grandparents. That was so far off the mark. It's basically a film about two young kids who visit their demented grandparents. I walked out. The granddaughter walks around the house filming everything. At one point, I wanted to stick my hands through the screen and smash that video camera to pieces. A couple of scenes are chopped. One scene in particular that annoyed the hell out of me was the 'oven' scene. In the trailer, the grandma demands the granddaughter to ""get inside"" the oven to clean it. I'm thinking ""That's pretty creepy. Grandma is going to bake her."" Nope. The granddaughter goes inside the oven for maybe a second tops and guess what, she wipes the oven and NOTHING happens. Why am I livid?

However, after sitting through this, and fast forwarding, I feel the need to cleanse myself of what was essentially a cinematic assault on my mind. A mind-raping f**k, if you will. All I can say is that the CIA could waterboard me, electrocute me, beat the living sh*t out of me, Chinese water torture me, and then flense and eviscerate me and they'd never break me. However, they could save a lot of time and effort by simply showing this movie to anyone they want to torture. The f'king rapping by the lisping stupid kid is enough to make anyone want to rip their ears off. Showing that old lady naked is enough to make strongest of iron stomachs wretch, and the whole sh*t diapers theme was absolutely disgusting and unnecessary.M.Night Shamawhatever, you sir should be ashamed of yourself.

238,verrucktcarlos,Scary,7,27 August 2016,"OK, this film is nothing special, it is not bad nor is it excellent. The story is interesting, though with obvious plot holes, the major one being, why didn't the mom show them a picture of the grandparents? they contact you after 15 years and you don't even call them? also, does the mom find super normal all of the things they did? ''they're just old people'', yeah because old people walk around naked at night, scratching walls and walking like a spider, when my grandparents were alive, the only thing they did at night was sleep. But, it is scary, the last part mainly, but, what I always think of when watching found footage style films is that, in such moments of tension and fear, why would you even bother taking the camera and film? anyway, the acting was good, don't get why people say the kid was annoying, he was a normal 13 year old kid, kinda funny at times actually. Also, the credits were off place, the movie itself wasn't a comedy horror like ''you're next'' for example, where the tone of the film is humorous, this one just had some funny dialogues, so that rap at the end didn't fit at all, also, would you actually be rapping about such a traumatic situation? anyway.",The Visit

240,Icedooitle,"Shyamalan, in-the-know",8,4 November 2015,"There is perhaps not another director of the last 20 years that breeds viewer expectations like M. Night Shyamalan. That is not to say that there is an expectation of excellence, just some pre- conceived notion movie watchers bring into the theater with them. I can only imagine what the general public made of the previews for his latest picture, The Visit. Found footage is a new venture for Shyamalan, but audiences have had their patience tested to the breaking point with each dry heave of a Paranormal Activity sequel (Don't worry, your likely to see a preview for the latest PA installment should you see The Visit.) What I was immediately curious about was how ""In the Know"" would Shyamalan be with this style? The ambiguity of what the pre-views revealed has the makings of a real horror, a comedy, and a spoof. So, what is it? I walked out of that movie less than a day ago and I still don't know; but that did not stop me from enjoying every moment of it. Becca and Tyler are a brother and sister duo that could only exist on paper. They bicker like they're in the pages of a Seinfeld re- run. Their vocabulary is years past what could be reasonably be expected of them. While this should clash with the ""realistic"" nature of found footage filming, it acts as a wink to the audience of what the movie is not. Becca is an ambitious 15-year-old with a knowledge of filmmaking that would likely surpass Shyamalan's while filming The Sixth Sense. She is presented with an opportunity to put her skills to use and learn about her family when her estranged grandparents make an offer to set aside the differences they have with their newly divorced daughter, and get to know their grandchildren. Becca will bring her ridiculous amount of production gear to the grandparents' house for a week-long visit. The documentary she films is, of course, our film. Her seemingly innocent and average Nana and Pop-Pop begin to unravel almost immediately. All the cliché events of this style of movie creep in one by one. What's in the shed? What was that thing that flashed across the screen? Why can't we come out of our rooms after 9:30? Every suspicious event gets some reassuring answer. You kids have watched too many movies. These occurrences go beyond suspicious into absurd. It is during these moments you find yourself thinking, ""Have I ever laughed while being this legitimately scared? Is this funnier than it is scary? What's the difference?"" That it achieves success in both of these qualities shows that Shyamalan is past ""The Know"" and in fact knows better than most. I can't say that you should leave all of your pre-conceived notions of the director at the door. In fact this is very much a Shyamalan flick. That you get to the end of this movie, with all of the disappointments of the last decade, with an exhale of relief that the man has still got it, is quite satisfying indeed.",The Visit

M Night Shyamalan has delivered definitely his scariest movie to date. It's super creepy and has some good scares and sticking to his true style has a good twist. The casting of the Grandparents is spot on. There are subtle clues towards the twist throughout the movie, none of which I picked up on but at the end i can't believe I didn't.What's bad about it. The children. I absolutely hated them. The boy who is around 10 is a rapper and severely annoying. The girl who is 15 speaks like she is a university professor and her character is highly unrealistic. Sorry but 15 year old's do not speak like that.

244,rolandjordaan2,The Visit - Spoiler Free Review,4,20 September 2018,"In 2008, M. Night Shyamalan brought us 'The Happening', then in 2010, he brought us 'The Last Airbender' and then in 2013, he brought us 'After Earth', it would literally have taken effort to create a movie that was half as bad as any of those and that's why, when he released 'The Visit' in 2015, audiences went nuts for it. Now, I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but this movie is still really bad; was it better than his previous efforts? Of course it was, all the movies I just listed had been the quality I'd expect if a producer gave Tommy Wiseau a Hollywood budget and told him to make a movie, they were absolutely irredeemable and anything would have been better, case and point: The Visit. 'The Visit' stars Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould as two overacting siblings, who are going to meet their estranged grandparents for the first time. Olivia DeJonge, staring as Becca, is making a documentary about the trip, in an futile effort to try and solve the mystery of why their mother had walked out on her parents and never spoken to them again. Yep, you guessed it, Shyamalan has made a found footage film...this gimmick had been getting old for a while and Shyamalan does not help this fact. During their visit, the grandchildren begin to discover some really weird things about their grandparents and try to discover what's going on; that's the plot. At the core, this could have been an okay movie, the plot is simple, not particularly original, but still fun. The twist actually makes sense, and although many claim to have seen it coming, I can't say that I did...simply because I didn't think Shyamalan was capable of coming up with one that was just regular The problem is though, this is obviously still a Shyamalan film, the acting is horrendous, not necessarily because these are all bad actors, but because they're acting in that over-the-top way that is a trope in any of his films. The 90 minute running time is also filled with nonsensical scenes that go nowhere, offer nothing to the plot and actually just make us like the characters even less. The dialogue sounds unnatural and is very unevenly written, with characters acting like 'Rug Rats' in one scene and adult characters in the next. The grandparents, portrayed by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie, are genuinely creepy at times but lose their edge as the film progresses, obviously not knowing what to do with their badly written characters. I think what stood out the most for me though, was how incredibly long this 90 minute film felt, it simply could not keep my interest and had me reaching for my phone several times, just to have something else to do. It was simply that boring of a film. Now I will admit that 'Split' the movie Shyamalan released one year after this, was a much better effort and did show that this man still has some talent left, therefore, if you're one of this people still watching his films in the hope of him again delivering something in the quality of his first two efforts, 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable', just skip this and go directly to 'Split', because this movie is simply too dull, average and unmemorable to ever really be enjoyable.
P.S.
I was going to be generous and give this 5 stars, but I literally deducted a point for the scene that played over the ending credits, which was simply the most out of place and soul crushing thing I've sat through all year. I hate you Shyamalan.",The Visit
245,Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer,A Welcome Visit From Shyamalan,8,11 September 2015,"The Visit is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Ed Oxenbould, Olivia DeJonge, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie, and Kathryn Hahn.The Visit revolves around two siblings, Becca(Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler(Ed Oxenbould), on their trip to met their estranged grandparents who they never previously had met. As they reach they are given a rather straight forward rule by their grandmother(Deanna Dungan), Don't stay up later than 9:30. Since the kids do, all hell breaks loose as they view some of the strangest things humans can ever do from their elderly grandparents.Shyamalan IS a great writer/director. He crafted a highly suspenseful and psychological thriller in the Sixth Sense. A emotional thrill ride for Unbreakable(My favorite of his). And, finally a pitch perfect atmosphere for Signs. This dude knows how to make movies. Though he's had more misses than hits, but he is persistent. I got to say his persistence payed off, big time.This movie was great! I was entertained the entire time. Shyamalan placed a close to flawless script in motion with taut, suspenseful thrills that grabs hold and never really lets go. That was marketed in the trailer. What wasn't marketed was the sheer hilarity of the script. I had a feeling that this would be a spoof on horror movies and I was right. The black comedy in this movie is untouchable and is thoroughly enthralling. Along with the thrills and comedy comes with a lot of thick emotional heft which was lacking in his past few entries. Finally the script offered realistic dialogue with little to no use of modern day jump scares with a twist so powerful it'll leave you breathless.On to the performances. The comedy in this movie is entirely credited to Ed Oxenbould. His instant out burst of rap are contagious. Not to mention his grade A sarcasm and charm should definitely land his a Golden Globe nod if not an Oscar. He was Mother Julia Roberts Good. He was the best part of this movie. A close second is Dianna Dungan. She was creepy, menacing, sympathetic and sweet all rolled into one beautiful performance. Although I didn't find documentarian Olivia Dejonge as entertaining as Dungan and Oxenbould, she added a certain depth to the movie as she and Oxenbould get over their personal phobias.As for negatives I had one minor one that snowballed into a big one. It's the over exaggeration of insanity of the grandparents' part. It was tolerable at first but then became tedious to watch nearing the end as they started to resemble real horror icons. Alas it slayed a close to perfect movie.The Visit is an extremely enjoyable entry into Shyamalan's filmography that ranks up to Signs and close to The Sixth Sense. I highly recommend a watch if one is looking for a comedy and a thriller but can only buy one ticket. The Visit gets an 8/10 or an A-.This movie is truly a welcome Visit from Shyamalan and a true end of summer treat.",The Visit

It has even been years since the last viewing and it seems worse. Like a lot of his movies the camera shoots away from who's talking or what's happening. All sort of weird angles, etc. I also fill like there was so much filler for the movie and when the supposed thrills start it's beyond late. I dislike this film.

248,SangamYadagiri,"Take a bow, it's Manoj, again!!",9,13 September 2015,"The Visit is an intelligent thriller that uses our senses to disguise the secrets just like the Sixth Sense did.The whole movie is made out of the footage from what kids have shot with their DSLR cameras. The natural camera angles makes some visual tension. The acting by the two talented kids is what captures the audience's imagination. And of course, the actors who played grandparents did an excellent job.Manoj Shyamalan could have cut the final movie as complete comedy or complete horror but he made it as 50% comedy initially and got the horror slowly unfold itself in the rest of the movie. Writing the screenplay is very difficult especially when it deals with the footage from reality-show-kind-of-scenes. But like he managed the same in Sixth Sense without reveling a bit of suspense till the very end, he did the same in this movie.Without revealing too much about the story, I can say that The Visit can be compared with The Sixth Sense easily. However, instead of serious drama, here the scenes are funny most of the time.I loved the movie myself along with the audience when I watched it today in the theater.

They haven't met before despite both kids being in their teens. This, due to something their own mother done as a teenager before leaving home never to reconcile any differences. But nana and pop pops have gotten in touch and think having the kids over would be an olive branch, of sorts. But when they get there, it's obvious something's not quite right with nana and pop pops. What unfolds is rambling game of hide and seek with added scares, but filmed by the kids who are making a documentary of their visit. But nana running around naked scratching doors and pop pops keeping an outhouse full of nappies he's soiled because he's incontinent doesn't trigger enough alarm bells to get out after the first night. And so it continues, with added rapping from the grandson, which just left me bemused along with a rambling narrative that wants to be scary and funny, but is neither. Whilst the usual Shyamalan twist isn't hard to spot and does nothing to make such a poor film any more interesting than it struggles to be.

Kids were anything but interesting, quite boring and flat actually. I have never heard kids talk the way these on screen kids were speaking. In truth, they really were not all that believable as characters. This is in keeping with bad writing, unnatural dialog that simply does not flow. This makes the characters stiff. Both my partner and myself found ourselves asking each other over and over again: ""what kid actually talks like this???"" Acting was way too over the top. There was very little on screen chemistry and the characters seemed to be falling all over one another. I got the impression most of them were missing their marks, cues or even forgetting their lines. A heck of a lot of pauses that just didn't fit the plot. The ending was rushed as if they had no idea how to create closure on such a horrible film. Scary it ain't. Funny it ain't. Deep it ain't. Worth seeing....it ain't. Personally the best part for me was watching the screen credits roll past. What a relief! Am I the only one who felt this was a stinker? No. Several other movie patrons, got up and left before the ending....and it was cheap ticket night! That's how bad this film is! No one is running in droves to see this film.

254,homdeb1058,Wait am I in the Right Theater?,5,17 September 2015,"The thing I found out (to my dismay) that I did not know before going to the theater was that a lot of this movie was shot in the long over-used and abused ""home movie/shaky cam"" format. If I had come in the theater in the middle of the movie, I might have assumed I had accidentally wandered into the 7th, or whatever, sequel to Paranormal Activity. And to add insult to injury M Night is about 8 years late to the party for that trick. Or was it suppose to be some type of irony or mocking of the standard horror movie fare? Perhaps this once creative director has finally succumbed to audience expectations --if all you want is cookie cutter, unimaginative, thematically barren, shaky cam, scary movies then here you go...... Another let down for me was that in his earlier movies there were always a number of positive sub-themes running through the movies that I found as interesting, if not more so, than the obvious scary movie theme. I failed to find any such redeeming parallel plot lines in The Visit. Again maybe he is just simplifying his movies to match his audience's wishes.On the upside, I did find this movie to be something of an improvement over his most recent efforts. There were a few good chuckles. There were a couple of OK jump scenes. There was some tension here and there, but overall still a disappoint for me. Of course, I eventually liked The Village and Signs a lot better after I had watched them several times on DVD. Maybe there is a jewel in the rough hiding here, just waiting to be found.

256,doofuspoofus,This was absolutely nothing special,6,12 September 2015,"For starters the reason this is the best found footage film is because it only gives the illusion of being found footage whilst being filmed professionally. Which is a relief because I'm so tired of these directors making a movie that looks like it was filmed by someone with Parkinson's disease and then calling it ""original"". The Blair witch project was original; after that it's just a bunch of lazy copycats.Now I am a fan of M. knight and I like his films even the ones people didn't like but this was just...not his style and not his style in a bad way. It just seemed like he was taking the chance to jump on a new trend as opposed to being original and thought provoking like he usually is; a modern Hitchcock if you will. And for most of the movie I was wondering why the trailer was made to look like the grandparents were going to be some sort of creatures when in actuality most of their symptoms were in fact dementia.The only thing I can say is the twist is worth the watch but like most found footage movies there's lame attempts at humor(like every stranger saying ""I used to be an actor"" just because she has a camera) mixed with actual humor. The cast is great and the direction too but just not his style at all. Now the twist is not that great but there is one.

Night Shyamalan attempts his first found-footage film, where a sister and brother, Becca and Tyler, spend a week at their out-of-touch grandparents' house in a small Pennsylvanian town. After the first night, they discover some strange things happening at night, involving the grandmother. It isn't much later that the Grandpa BEGINS getting out of wack.I think everyone already knows the premise of this story. - The whole film is mixed with horror and comedy, but not like most of those dumb low-budget horror films. This one is different; very eerie. I could not help but laugh at how dark it was. The grandparents seem incoherent at times which adds to the suspense. As time progresses, the two siblings find more and more abnormalities through out their stay.I would RECOMMEND this movie to the simple-minded folks who DO NOT OVERTHINK movies. This is not the type of film that should be praised, nor is it going to put M. Night Shyamalan back on top, but it is a treat to watch. Honestly, I don't think Mr. Shymalan will ever bring himself back up. Especially, after The Last Airbender.One scene in particular that gets you thinking is one of the very first weird occurrences with the grandma. - The two kids are playing hide and seek under the shadowy porch when all the sudden she pops out of nowhere and trying to catch them; whispering sweet nothings to them and crawling like a demon.<><><>I RATED this film a 5 out of 10, only because it is not my cup of tea for a mind- teaser. I say, when you make a comedy ""dark"" then you should take it all the way. Don't half-ass it! Burns those fricken kids! That's just my opinion. There is also the tone of the film which did not really match all the way through. The morals sort of screwed you, or not. Depending on your IQ, I guess.-- Michael Mendez",The Visit
259,saymaraza,The Visit review,9,27 March 2016,"In this truly terrifying 'm knight Shamaylan' thriller, it leaves me on the edge of your seat. I really enjoyed this movie, one of the best m knight Shamaylan films in years, probably his best since unbreakable in my opinion. It was a very enjoyable film with jump scares and some creepy Sequences were involved. I thought the twist that it ended on was brilliant, and definitely did not see it coming. I am a huge movie fan, and like a big variety of films in general, but have never really been a big horror fan, so I wasn't expecting much from it when I started watching it, but no, it was a real treat and very unexpected. I think m knight Shamaylan has his own great style in his films, and I can honestly say this is one of his greatest works over the years. Definitely worth a watch! I think that the actors/actress who played the old couple of grandma and grandpa were perfect, so weird, and mysterious that it left you shaking in your pants whenever you see them on screen in the corner of your eye. It's the sort of movie that would leave you worried about whenever you mother leaves the house and she leaves you with your grandparents to look after you....",The Visit
260,starsteamer,Bloody awful,1,4 July 2016,"Well, that's time in my life I'll never get back! The problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it is. It can't decide if it is a black comedy or a horror. It is not funny enough for the first and not good enough for the second. Due to the plot, this should create an unnerving, claustrophobic atmosphere. However, this falls very flat. In addition to this, the characters are far too two-dimensional: as a viewer I really didn't care what happened to them. The mother is unbelievable, as are her actions which make up the main plot- would you just send your children to stay with your parents you had been estranged from for fifteen years? The grandparents and the children are stereotypical and superficial, the plot is predictable and eye-rollingly bad. The mise-en-scene is poor. The film lacks at every level. Avoid at all costs.",The Visit

262,starcraftbw88,Disappointed,2,16 January 2016,"Shyamalan is such a hack now days, this movie was straight terrible. It drug out an immediately predictable story with long pointless sequences like a white kid rapping and dumb decisions by the protagonists like the sister going into to the basement while leaving her brother alone with crazies. And the payoff was about as good as a Chinese fortune cookie.The movie itself is not scary, the ""twist"" didn't even feel like a twist because it's quite apparent within the first 10 minutes of the movie and the constant foreshadowing - most of the movie is foreshadowing something the audience already sees coming - with cheap jump scares and ridiculously slow scenes that have no tension. The pacing of the movie is abysmal, it did a better job as horse tranquilizer than something one might call entertainment. I didn't go into the movie expecting much based off Shyamalan's recent stuff, but I was highly disappointed.",The Visit
263,bardia-moose,What Was Previously An Inescapable Nightmare Has Now Become An Underdog Tale,7,16 September 2015,"Here it is, the film we've all been waiting for; the moment of truth, if you will. M. Night Shyamalan's recent endeavours have left me in complete and utter confusion. What happened to the man who made Signs, Unbreakable, and The Sixth Sense? Does that man still exist? Or has all traces of him been extinguished? Well, having seen THE VISIT, I can confidently say that M. Night Shyamalan is plotting a career comeback. This is, very much, an intimate, stripped-down, director-driven project. It's not a great movie, but it's miles ahead of his last few. I would put this on par with Signs, and just below Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense. This film is being marketed as a horror, and, while it's certainly creepy, there's a lot of great humor as well. The acting perfectly fits the kind of tone Shyamalan was going for, most notably with the grandmother played by Deanna Dunagan. The very natural and believable brother-sister relationship between the two lead actors is not only a testament to the co-leads themselves but also to Shyamalan for bringing those performances out of them. When you compare this to the stilted and wooden performances in his last few films, you can't help but give credit where credit is due. With his reputation on the line, M. Night had to go out and use a style with just as little reputation: found-footage. If I wasn't cautious already, this definitely sealed the deal. But I must say, M. Night does an admirable job. Even with a filming style as stale as this, Shyamalan makes it feel refreshing and new. And while you can expect the famous Shyamalan twist at the end of the movie, the most shocking twist, for me anyway, is that it's a good movie. I hope what this movie does is put an end to all the Shyamalan hate. Sure, he's made stinkers here and there, and should not be excused for them. But his decision of skewing away from blockbusters and coming back to smaller-budget horror and suspense films, the very thing that made him who he is today, is telling. What was previously an inescapable nightmare has now become an underdog tale.",The Visit

Also, the movie in general was too ""surface"". It wasn't deep enough or focused enough to pull me in. I never lost sight of the fact that I was watching a movie.I watched the alternate ending on the bonus reel, which I preferred over the official ending. That said, I wasn't bowled over by either ending. I prefer rich, rewarding endings that last a bit longer, sort of like a really good fireworks finale.The Sixth Sense was my favorite movie of all time, and I totally enjoyed M.

A well written and executed creepy filmOur film follows Becca and Tyler who is on a trip to their grandparents whom they've never met and whom their mom has a distant relationship with. Becca is an aspiring film director and films they entire thing They arrive and all seems well Nana is a sweet old lady who likes to cook and pop pop is a all busy farmer , usually out in the shed.
Things start to get eerie and strange when they notice their grandparents strange behavior, such as Nana running around naked at night and pop pop secretly hiding a secret in the basement and shed. They get weirder and weirder each night especially Nana.Without spoiling much , That's your basic story, and its not your basic found footage movie, Becca has some great shots and placements of the camera, it not shaky can or anything that will make you dizzy, it's a well filmed and executed movie. You get some great acting from both the kids and the grandparents, top notch in that department, the film has some humour, as Nana's actions can be so weird that its funny but still in a scary and eerie way, Tyler is the funny one, with his silly rap and using celebrity names instead of swearing.I will not spoil the twist for you, its is a rather good one, some will see it coming others won't, but in the end its not something I expected or the my friend I was watching it with.Overall I loved this movie, its great acted and written, scary atmosphere and just overall one of my favourites in the found footage department.

267,lmcressia,What was this crap???,3,27 February 2018,"Why do I watch Shyamalan's movies!! I can't say this is his worst movie (The Village) but geez! I will admit that I did not see the twist coming. Which is the first time that has happened in one of his movies since Unbreakable (most of his movies I cannot even discern what the twist was supposed to be). So some kids go to their grandparents house. The older child is an obnoxious, pretentious film snob -- one can only hope this is Shyamalan admitting to the world that he takes himself and his work WAY too seriously. The pertinent information is set up SO AWKWARDLY it is ridiculous. Randomly, the younger child starts talking about a past football experience that later becomes relevant. There HAD to be a better way to fit that in the story. The germ-phobia was also forced into the story so it could later be a plot device. That could easily have been worked in more elegantly. Also, haven't we seen the germ-phobia thing before? and the sports rage?I was not expecting much from this film, and it delivered.

If you like scary movies that are smart, you'll like this. I don't want to give it away, but when the kids get to the grandparents things get progressively worse and darker by the day. This is the kind of movie that sends chills down your spine and is a real psychological thriller. Suffice it to say it has great creepy scenes, and great twists I never saw coming. That is so wonderful I can't explain it as I feel like most of what I watch today is nothing more than elements of movies I've seen before chopped up and recycled into a new crap movie. There is none of that here. I loved it, I'd watch it again, I'd recommend it to anyone who loves psychological thrillers.

269,alexanderstephencraig,Not my favorite but not the worst.,6,15 August 2016,"First off I liked the plot for the most part. One thing I can't usually buy is the maturity of the children. Most movies screw this up. I don't believe a 13 year-old when they talk as if they're in college. The female child lead roll seemed unbelievably smart and that's not exactly bad because it is possible but when you add in the mother's character and her inability to call her parents to ask how her kids are behaving, just rubs me the wrong way. And the boy is incredibly annoying to be honest. So much so that it made me hate when his character talked.The filming was the 'found footage' style which I didn't know but it was a lot better than most films of that style so that's a plus.The story wasn't bad and the twist I did like. It however didn't entirely explain some of the behaviors of the grandparents which really annoyed me. I also again hated how the mom didn't even know. I think M. Night has done better but he's done worse. The Happening for example was garbage. This film is worth a rent and one time watch but that's all I would give it.",The Visit
270,Nibbler007,Who said this wasn't a horror film?,8,3 October 2015,"I rarely do film reviews, but when one does deserve an opinion, whether is overcritisiced or overrated, I always feel I have to give my point of view.The Visit was a film I didn't expect to be one of a kind, or really captivating. Mostly because of Blumhouse Productions' fondness of sick-and-tiring mockumentary and Shyamalan's filming and writing wreckage these years. Both making a horror film could've mean a disaster together. Imagine a very low budget Blumhouse mockumentary with Shyamalan's obsession with lame scripting on those last movies he did.I was very wrong.The Visit has the grittyness of Sinister and Paranormal Activity, but M. Night Shyamalan's famous -and sometime infamous- twists. It's a welcome beginning of I expect a new formula in terms on writing and producing at least. Blumhouse + Shyamalan = explosive horror combo!!!! You even forget it's a mockumentary! That's an achievement! I wonder how much does M Night Shyamalan to do with the whole process, but he seems to take the wheel on this one, and he can still give us goosebumps (heavy ones), he knows how to do it and boy he delivers.God damn it scared me the whole ride! Mostly because Deanna Dunagan 's grandma character. Oh, man... you have to see her to believe me.A good horror movie is not about how gory it is, it's about how scary it can get, and this one is damn scary no matter how comedic it may seem from time to time. Stephen Kings' IT -the miniseries- was comedic too. Comedy sometimes is cynicism. Every little or big horror film has to bring some forced comedy, because makes the horror a lot better, as a counterpart. I didn't hear any complaints about zombie B-movies we all love which have a lot of twisted humor. Sorry to say the fun gags here were not so funny and sometimes were out of place. OK, for the detractors of this film I give you that as a concession, but no less. This movie stills being a horror standout in its own terms. Found myself talking about Stephen King? This one has a less sadic resemblance to his work, but still remind me of him in some passages, mostly on claustrophobic sense of horror (found some tribute to The Shining), and sociopath characters too. This movie also does a mostly well-done tribute to some Japanese classic and its Hollywood threshed horror. Pay no mind on flaws, The Visit is all things put together with good results. Fierce drama, scary horror, spoofed comedy, good acting overall.And I thought this one was not funny at all despite unnecessary comedy and unfunny gags. It really did scare me, and scared me the whole ride.I liked this movie very much. Could be better? There is always room for improvement. I am very optimistic about that.Enjoyable, but after all, the few words I can give you as a conclusion: scary, entertaining and very enjoyable M Night Shyamalan 's film. OH God, love to say this. He is absolutely back!",The Visit
271,befoulmetalroosa,M. Night Shyalamon should retire,4,23 April 2016,"This was so not worth it. A mom and her two kids, dumped by dad, are barely existing. Mom keeps picking up losers, who keep dumping her. Her fifteen year old daughter wants to be a documentary filmmaker, while her younger son wants to be another eminem. So, to give mom time to enjoy herself with the latest man, the kids offer to go visit grammy and grampy for a week. They get there, and all kinds of odd things happen, culminating in a last-minute rescue. The end.The only thing worth watching in this whole mess were the kids. The boy was pricelessly cute and charming, and very effective as the smarta** that all little brothers become. The girl was serious (maybe a bit too serious) and dedicated. Both kids bore emotional scars from dad's abandonment of them, which colored how they related with their world.While with grammy and grampy, strange things occur overnight. Grammy is found naked, scratching the walls and doors. Or, she runs from room to room, all hunched over with arms clasped behind her back. Or, she lurks outside the kids' bedroom door with a butcher knife in hand. During the day, she's slightly less odd. She crawls around underneath the porch, terrifying the kids who had gone under there to play hide and seek. She sits in a rocking chair, facing a wall and laughing at...nothing.Grampy, on the other hand, is a little more...stable? He hides his crap-filled diapers in a shed. What he's saving them for is anyone's guess. At one point, the girl catches him as he puts the barrel of a shotgun in his mouth. Needless to say, the grandparents have issues. As the week progresses, the kids become more and more panicked and beg their mom to come get them. The 'visit' culminates with grammy trying to kill the girl and getting stabbed with a piece of mirror for her trouble, and grampy terrorizing the boy and rubbing his poo-filled diaper all over the boy's face, because the kid is a germophobe. That scene was relentlessly cruel and unnecessary, as well as repulsive. The girl finally escapes the locked bedroom of dead grammy, only to be attacked by grampy. The boy finally takes charge and batters grampy's head in with the refrigerator door.The movie was a mess. The shocking 'twist' was that they weren't actually the real grammy and grampy. They were nuts who escaped from the nuthouse that the real grammy and grampy had volunteered at. It was as dull, lifeless, and trite as his previous movies, but most especially The Village. Nothing new was explored, and the 'frights' were nonexistent.",The Visit
272,Cathex,I See Old People...,6,12 October 2015,"Firstly, I apologise for the predictable caption, but it was too tempting. Also, if we do view this movie in light of Shyamalan's, Sixth Sense, then it seems almost casual by comparison. But in its own right this film is both fun and really quite scary!The film does a great job of misleading us, making us think that we're in for something altogether more light hearted than it actually is, and for that reason the horror moments are all the more effective. Yet it also doesn't push us too far, providing comic relief just when things get a bit too disturbing. However, despite its well placed scares and cleverly formulated creepiness, its just a bit too much like a ghost train ride to make it worth more than a mention . The scares it uses are for scares sake alone and the director uses his ingredients well but the movie lacks any real meat. Best watched without first viewing the trailer I believe.",The Visit

Oh my f-ing god what an obnoxious little brat he was ...throughout the entire movie .I admit I chuckled at one or two things he said but he has got to be one of the most obnoxious characters to grace the screen in years .It's either him making some lame remark to his pathetically irritating raps to his misogynistic attitude towards and about women to finally essentially calling his sister ugly .The twist was interesting but I'm sure it's been used before in better movies then this one.The end was anti climatic rushed and made absolutely no sense whatsoever .The mom was also just ...there really she didn't really add anything to the film except one I will admit part where a true mothers reaction comes to play.The best parts are in the previews and even that they wound up screwing up in some ways or another .So the point of this review is to simply say rent before you buy I was gonna buy this and I'm very grateful I wound up renting it instead.It is definitely not worth the money one visit was more then enough for me .",The Visit

277,snarkyphilo,The Visit,7,26 September 2015,"From Technical perspective, the found footage style worked well with the film and the filmmakers were fierily consistent in maintaining the style throughout. It added an extra layer of experience for the viewers of the children, and combined with a good use of environment (tight confining crawl spaces, sprawling fog shrouded farm land), enhancing the horror and humour elements, the technical were pretty solid.The Characters worked well, each actor pulling of a stellar performance, particularly Deanna Dunagan as Doris; you can tell she was having a blast playing her role. The older girl was the least enjoyable, coming across as perhaps a bit to pretentious, but that could be purposeful, possibly a mild self-parody at some filmmakers in general.Narrative wise this was perhaps one of M. Night. Shyamalan's tighter stories; there was the absence of the inexplicable plot holes that existed in some of his other films (Signs for example) or a weak climax (The Village for another example); the plot progression flowed well enough, and though it took a bit of a slow start in the beginning, it did use that slow start to establish the two protagonists well.The manipulation of tension was one of the stronger parts of the film. A sense of ""will it or wont it"" sinisterism that purveys some of the scenes, like the one where the protagonists are playing under the porch when they are suddenly beset upon by their rather creepily scuttling grandma only to have her pop out after them from under the porch after them and proclaim in an amused manner that she was just playing. It turned the moment of tension and jump scare into a moment of playful eccentricity, making it more a ""what the Fay Dunaway was that?!"" type of scene, but in a good way. This sentiment is carried out throughout the film, and keeps the sense of slightly skewed tension well.while the film does have its flaws here and there, it's an enjoyable watch with some good tension, great acting, and decent cinematography. One of Shyamalan's better films as of late.",The Visit
278,shaunvanhaelewijn,"Not a Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but very decent picture in many ways",7,9 August 2017,"First of all I'm not really one of those M. Night Shyamalan die-hard fans. To tell you the truth the two only movies I really liked of him, were: ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". In my opinion everything went really downhill after this. Including ""The Village"" who was an over hyped movie in every respect.So going in this M. Night Shyamalan movie is always a leap in the dark for me. First of all when I learned this just was another home-video meets ""The blair witch project"" style of movie, I really wasn't keen on watching this movie. I don't know why but, I still gave it a chance. And I must say this is the first time this director didn't really disappoint me. First of all the home-video style really add to the suspension this picture so desperately need. Any other style would have done this picture no credit. So that was actually an excellent choice. Throughout the movie I never really got bored, it really did help me to duck in to the story. If you don't like this style of movie or filming, just stop reading here and don't watch the movie. You won't like it!The story wasn't nothing to refreshing, but it was done in the style that you still went with it. Most of the jump scares were predictable. I felt the jump scares weren't needed, just the whole eerie feeling was enough to make it a genuine horror/thriller picture.Acting by the grandparents was really well done. Magnificent. Concerning the kids it would have made the movie so much better if the boy was replaced by a better actor. Somehow he just didn't feel authentic, at all! Maybe they just tried to make him too funny. I never laughed once, and frankly it just put me off. The acting done by the girl was good.I give this movie a 7/10 because some things weren't done good enough to really make it a movie that would stick in my mind.

What could possibly go wrong?There are some interesting little twists and turns in this movie, alongside the big ones, and the unpredictability of the weirdness keeps it taut. As it turns out, although you start out wanting the kids to just die (especially the rappin' one), they've got their traumatic reasons. Watch out for them conquering those fears at the end; that's their redemption.The generation gap thrown up by this family union seems to be a couple of centuries - that's how it works.
As it plays out it's hard to say what will happen next; even the usual late escalation is not a forgone conclusion. There is more of an unfolding of information than a loaded spring, and glimpses into the unseen provide the creepiness and make it hard to see ahead. No apparent motive for the strangeness emerges until hinted at in the final scenes, by which time it doesn't matter that everything was nonsense.There's a refreshing, quirkly flavour to this movie, a spark or two of originality quite necessary when it's done on the cheap, and nothing too much like anything else.

I loved The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village and Unbreakable but I did not like After Earth, The Happening and Lady in the Water. So how many other directors are there who made only fantastic films in their career? William Freidkin, Milos Forman, Oliver Stone and even the great Sidney Lumet made some bad films continuously in their career. How many hurled hate mongering at them? Not many, and rightly so, because they are still great and their good films are still good films. So is/are Shyamalan & his good films.You probably know The Visit's plot already - it is told through an interesting storytelling device of raw footages of a young documentary filmmaker (highly resonating with today's age which makes film making anyone's game especially for children). Night combines horror & comedy so skilfully and deftly that it was possible for the audiences to laugh and scream at one minute and then scream at the next. There are some disturbing turns in the story and some hilarious moments too - both co-exist perfectly throughout. When you think about it in the end, the humour had a good place in the story. The funny scenes involving the children were all based on an assumption us, the audience and some characters were on. Both children - Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould - were excellent. Highly talented and funny. Night also achieved all this with remarkable simplicity. There are no complex layers or non-linear timeline - it was a simple story with a simple twist that runs through a 7 day period. I heard the entire theatre laugh out and enjoy thoroughly when the credits were rolling. You'll see why.Shyamalan is a fine director, this shouldn't surprise many who liked his earlier work. If you're not one of those getting onto silly bandwagons of hatred or fanboyship without a strong rationale, this film will entertain you for sure. IMO, The Visit is probably not as good as Sixth Sense but just as enjoyable as ANY good horror films in recent years.",The Visit

All the actors in this movie done there part with perfection specially both Olivia Dejonge and Ed Oxenbould (both child actors) are good in there part.

The grandma was extremely creepy throughout, unfortunately she is one of the only good things about this film. The other good thing was the twist, i actually didn't see that coming and i thought the film was heading in a completely different direction. Now the bad points - The Acting! it was terrible! The children were extremely annoying (last i checked that's not how children speak).

I could even appreciate The Lady in the Water to a certain extent believe it or not. Still, I had to rationalize me following M.Night Shamyalan more and more. But I'm glad I hung in there. This was a complete surprise! I found myself praying that it would have a strong finish halfway through. And it didn't disappoint me in the least.

(no spoilers),7,13 January 2017,"I've quit on Shyamalan's movies years ago and never looked back, a friend whose tastes I respect insisted and I gave this a chance. Glad I did.M Night still has the skill for creating chilling sequences that rely only on his actors and clever framing, there's stuff here on par with his best work, even a twist, his scripts however are the weakest link and this is no exception, there's a certain scene where one character does something so stupid and unnecessary that nearly ruined the film's climax.Also, this is found footage, a sub genre that is love it or hate it for some people, the kids document everything and the film is made from pieces of this footage, they are constantly breaking the fourth wall speaking to the camera and holding it in their hands. The film looks professional enough though, nothing too blurred and shaky so if you get motion sickened easily there's a hope this won't make you puke.If you're like me and lost interest in M Night's stuff but loves horror, give this one a chance.",The Visit
301,mhikmetaltug,"Ridiculously Interesting, A visit to the ""6th Sense"", ""The Visit"" Critic.",7,6 October 2015,"Wow! That was crazy. I have been used to seeing interesting and unique ideas, especially twisted ending parts from Night Shyamalan since I have watched the ""6th Sense"". However, the Visit almost made me feel like I was watching the 6th Sense's some parts again.The Genre of the ""6th Sense"" was pure Thriller. I must admit that all terrific, horrific, thrilling genres have been seemed like copies of each other, as they couldn't have gone beyond the stereotype ""Horror Films"" on my eyes. Even the 6th sense was not a horror in an exact way, it made me startle with its sudden horrific scenes. The cold and creepy depiction of the thrillers, take Shyamalan one step forward all the time. And in ""The Visit"", I felt nearly creeped out as much as the 6th Sense. The movie is ridiculous yes, if you don't go deep to Shyamalan's narrative world while watching it, you will probably watch it as a child's play. But for the reason I mentioned before, (that contextual reading of Shyamalan films) you will love this ridiculousness as film goes by and comes to the climax while reaching the final.I gave the ""6th Sense"" example of Shyamalan because, my feeling was almost the same in the ""6th sense"". For instance, the ""6th Sense"" goes on a straight line, in a narration of a boy and his relationship with his psychiatrist. The boy sees dead people and his mother is worried about him. And she tries to heal his psychology with an expert psychologue (We think). The movie keeps us thrilled and wondered about the kids situation, with hoping to see that he's accepted by his mother with the proof of his sanity and relief of the exposing his sights are for real.Then suddenly, we leave the classic narration on the climax and say: Oh My GOD! And bingo. My all time favorite's analogical version appeared, on the screen just after I saw the similar climax in The Visit and flashed the ""6th Sense"" on my eyes.The camera angles were good. In my opinion, the pastiche of the amateur camera shootings was better and more effective than other paranormal movies or documentary type pastiched movies. The teenager enthusiasm of shooting his/her first documentary movie, depicted perfectly by Shyamalan as brother and sister use the camera both within a try of imitating the professionals and, by the way, forgetting that they are shooting a documentary occasionally and making the camera a part of their chaffing and playings. This idea of the amateur camera shooting was one of the best I have ever seen including the most realistic and natural one ""The Blair Witch Project."" Shyamalan loves to show kids or teens enthusiasm of shooting a film or their camera setting in order to catch real time thrilling proofs, with their researcher and curious identities. He used this phenomenon again such as we watched Haley Joel Osmond's discovery of the videotape, showing a young girl's dying process chronologically. Usually, the creepy video footages discovered by children phenomenon we see in Shyamalan's works, is just like a sign of him, maybe because of his childhood memories including his curious shootings while imagining to be a director.The insignificant Genre made me confused a little bit. The emotional instability of the characters can make you nervy. The Visit contains the childish humor and all of a sudden it becomes as a serial killer story with all apart from the previous scene's absurdness. And one second later It may turn into a family drama. For this reason of Pastiche of various genres and eclectism complexity, I have begun my sentences with mentioning its ridiculous charm and interesting context. If you like Shyamalan's significant marks of eclectism, ( I believe that because of he's Indian, he has the spirit of the great complex and intriguing Bollywood movie directors) I recommend to you to watch ""The Visit.""",The Visit

305,bournemouthbear,Not Exactly a Return to Form But Fun Anyway,6,30 September 2015,"The Visit (2015)Back in the summer of 2008 I was ostracised by two good friends. I had arranged to meet with them for a couple of drinks before viewing The Happening, the then latest twist-in-the-tale flick from twist-in-the- tale merchant M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan had made his name with 1999's The Sixth Sense a film with a twist that became a major talking point (even if it was effectively pulling the same end 'shock' as Jacob's Ladder and the original Carnival of Souls before it) and both critics and audiences alike felt subsequently cheated when he repeated the same stunt of plonking a twist in each tale he then committed to the big screen.What I felt was missed by mainstream critics is that Shyamalan may have incorporated the same gimmick of w twist each time however he was also bold enough to come up with an original story that was indeed unique that in itself is a rare beast in commercial cinema. I'm not saying his ideas necessarily worked but fair game to him for attempting to pull off something different. 2008's The Happening being one such example.I was unable to meet my friends for The Happening as my bus back from Exeter, some hundred miles from home, was caught up in bad traffic. My friends saw the film and both shunned me soon after telling me I didn't show up on purpose. It was some months later that I watched the same film with my then partner and I could see why.There was an interesting idea at work in The Happening but the execution of it was shoddy. The Happening also played as if the studio had recut the film to a shape where it played shorter but made less sense than it should have. Subsequently Shyamalan's name on a film became a dirty word. But that could be about to change. The Visit is about the writer/director wrestling back artistic control after seeing many of his prior movies taken away from him and final cut denied, such as with the aforementioned The Happening.Teenage brother and sister Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are packed off by their mother Paula (Kathryn Hahn) to spend a week with their grandparents as she pops off on a cruise with her new boyfriend. This will be a baptism of fire for both the youngsters and the wrinklies as the kids have never been in the company of their grandparents. Rebecca uses the occasion to make a documentary given her aspirations to as a budding film-maker.The reason for the teenagers having never met their grandparents is because their mother eloped with her high-school teacher leading to a 'disagreement' - full details of which are unknown. Naturally, given this is a horror film of sorts, their grandparents' abode is pretty much in the middle of nowhere and wouldn't you just know it their elders prove to be rather bonkers. Things start strangely and become increasingly bizarre for the teenage siblings.The Visit sees the man formerly only revered for The Sixth Sense back to some sort of decent form. It's by no means perfect and doesn't work well under close scrutiny but it is entertaining and it IS scary. Mark Kermode slated The Visit but then he's traded being a proper critic for easy headlines whilst nursing his Zec Efron man crush and making an unneeded appearance in the recent Absolutely Fabulous episodes - hardly leaves him in a position to throw stones at others. After all he's as much a one-trick pony as Shyamalan still dining out on his reputation born out of waffling on about The Exorcist.In the same year that his The Sixth Sense broke records there was another horror flick that became a substantial hit. This other film's success gave birth to the found-footage sub genre. It was called The Blair Witch Project. Jump forward fifteen years and here is Shyamalan aping a format rather than creating his own but unlike many that came in the wake of Blair Witch Shyamalan's movie actually works. Shyamalan's voice is still evident in the writing, especially in that of the documentary-making daughter, and it irks a little. It is far more restrained than when he wrote himself a character in his Lady in the Water, a character that happens to write something that will change our world for the better - talk about delusions of grandeur.The feel-good ending may jars tonally and feels tacked on. No one would be so smiley and casual about recounting such horrors even a few months on from the event. You'd be scarred for life. To detail my other niggles about The Visit would mean giving away spoilers so instead I'll summarise. There are laughs, there are scares, it's well acted but hugely flawed and it's a far better film than the director's previous form would have indicated and bodes well for his next outing despite what Mr Kermode says.Check out more of my reviews at www.mybloodyreviews.com",The Visit

Now there are bad things in this movie. The movie tries very desperately to be funny, and stretches jokes out as long as possible. It also has some really horrible gross-out humor. It's also not very scary. Most of the scares are just cheap jump scares, or scares taken out of another movie. Now there are good parts to this movie too. It does do a good job setting atmosphere and tone. And they are a couple moments that are actually creepy. The acting by the main characters are actually pretty good. This is another Shyamalan movie with a twist ending. The Twist ending is decent but nothing extraordinary. This isn't the worst movie ever, and from M. Night Shyamalan, who hasn't made a good movie in over a decade, I'd say this is the first step in a welcome return for M. Night Shyamalan. I wouldn't recommend seeing it, but I'd say M.

310,jennifer626,Flawed but entertaining,6,23 January 2016,"Shyamalan has suffered like few other directors as a result of his later films not measuring up to the exacting standards set by The Sixth Sense and Signs. Part of this is self-inflicted, because he has refused to veer from the""M. Night Shyamalan"" formula: modern fairy tale crafted to take an unexpected turn approximately two-thirds into the fun. When the twist fails to impress or the fairy tale is dull, the movie disappoints audiences on on two levels. Not only is the movie judged mediocre, but it is criticized for failing to deliver on the promise made by Shyamalan's earlier efforts.The fairy tale and twist delivered by The Visit do not disappoint. Hansel and Gretel effectively employ today's media and technology for narration and exposition, leading the viewer down an increasingly foreboding path. The fear and anxiety caused by Nana and Pop-Pop's odd behavior appeal to our politically incorrect subconscious: we shy away and are even repulsed by displays of dementia and senility, no matter how clinically explicable we understand those displays to be. I was pleasantly surprised that the predicted twist was not predictable, and I felt a sincere surge of a-ha! at its revelation.The Visit falls short with respect to the traditional elements of film-making. The children, particularly the brother, are portrayed as cloying, non-credible 1980s sitcom characters with cheesy lines. Attempts at humor come off like a toast at a Dirty Dancing era summer camp in the Catskills. The siblings show no sign of being actual teenagers from the 21st century until approximately 45 minutes into the film, when they interview each other for their ""documentary"" and reveal certain vulnerabilities. The forced nature of this scene serves to highlight the otherwise inauthentic personalities assigned to them by the director and script. The mother's character is painted with the same superficial gloss, a problem magnified by her limited time on screen. These weaknesses prevented me from empathizing with the family members and reminded me throughout that I was indeed watching a movie.Perhaps Shyamalan was so focused on invoking his brand upon The Visit that he was distracted from maintaining its essential quality. Like many other viewers, I still look forward to the film where he regains that balance.",The Visit

The advertisements for the theatre release cleverly hid this from the public, for marketing reasons of course. So people got sucked in.OK enough of the found footage rant. I'm in the theater now, cheap matinée day for older releases. I just realized its a cam corder movie. DoI walk-out? I was tempted. But the child actors kept it interesting so I toughed it out to the end. The twist in the story wasn't much of a surprise and I pretty much figured it out when the doctor showed up at the house.

314,markusibbetson,Another dud from M. Night Shyamalan,2,24 August 2020,"It would appear that M. Night is one of those one hit wonders. He had great success with the Sixth Sense (which is a great film), but since then he has had some real turkeys like The Village and The Happening. The Visit is another that falls into that category, though it's not nearly as bad as The Village.
The film keeps you guessing, which is one of the only good things about it, you're left wondering what's going on with Nana and Pop Pop. Unfortunately with a lot of this sort of thing, what you imagine might be going on is much better than the revelation of what is really happening. Like when horror films only give you glimpses of the monster and the full reveal is disappointing (I'm thinking Jeepers Creepers here).
Nana's bizarre behaviour has you wondering if she's possessed or some kind of alien, but the truth is rather dull.
From one piece of clothing found in the basement, we're led to believe that Nana and Pop Pop are mental patients, however this just leaves you with questions, not least of which is how did the two escape? Also what kind of idiots share personal information with mental patients? The actual grand parents told the imposters that not only are their grandchildren are coming to visit, but they tell them exactly what day they're arriving and what time. Unless of course the real grand parents simply tell the mental patients that their grand children are visiting and then the mental patients escape, take their place and then arrange the full details of the trip? Seems unlikely.
Also, for mental patients, Nana and Pop Pop are convientiently lucid and 'normal' a lot of the time.
Overall, the Visit, like a lot of Shyamalan's films, could have been better. A good film premise, but let down by the revelation/twist toward the end.",The Visit
315,jkling-1,Thoroughly enjoyable. Night gets back toward his roots and should stay there,9,7 December 2015,"Overall, I really liked this movie. I can certainly understand why the reviews are, mostly, a mix of ""love it / hate it"". This won't be for everyone.One thing that we look for in a Night film is that creepy factor and I personally got it in spades a bunch of times.Are there things I would change? OK sure. The final scene that Night added with the two kids - move that to the very end of the credits, if you must have it at all. And I agree with some other posters regarding where the ""real ending"" should have been - with the kids in the police car. The scene after that with the mother just wasn't needed and was just unnecessary. Less is more.What I would also like is if Night could have added a few clues that, if we were really paying attention, might have gotten us to figure out the reveal before the reveal. The kind of clues that most people PROBABLY would see on a second viewing but not as much the first time through. Now that he's made it, there will be all sorts of people saying that he could have done this or that, etc - well ... I'd LIKE to see an alt ending with a horror bent. From my black point of view, that would be better.Should the kids have been ""more creep'd out"" sooner? Hmmm ... well maybe, but their grandparents ARE old ... and old people have problems and aren't we all taught how darn UNDERSTANDING we all need to be all the time now? When the big reveal happened ... OMG ... I was floored. Awesome! Anyway, this movie won't be for everyone and I'm not keen on the constant use of the hand-held cam but it mostly worked here. The movie probably only really deserves an 8/10 for me but I'm giving it a 9 to help balance all the, IMO, overwhelmingly nasty 1/2 star reviews.",The Visit
316,d_stack04,"Good, not great, could have been better",6,22 September 2015,"Ever since The Village I have always walked into a Shayamalan movie with the lowest of expectations. That was reinforced by Lady in the Water and cemented as my mindset with The Happening. These movies, along with a lack of children or any interest in the stories, made it easy for me to skip The Last Airbender and After Earth.So I was intrigued when I heard that Shayamalan took his fat check from the Will Smith story written turd to self finance a smaller movie to regain artistic control over his films. After seeing the first trailer I felt something I hadn't felt since halfway through The Village, excitement for a Shayamalan movie. I avoided seeing any more footage or trailers to keep myself in the dark about any possible spoilers or the trademark Shayamalan twist. However, I still kept my expectations low because we've all been fooled by a good trailer (I'm looking at you, A-Team.)The Visit exceeded these expectations. I'm not a huge fan of found footage films, mind you, but this one is the exception. The Visit tells the story of two teenagers who visit their grandparents for the very first time. The reason we're told that it has taken this long for these family members to finally meet is because the children's mother, played very well by Kathryn Hahn, ran away from home and hasn't spoken to them since.The older child, Becca, documents this visit with the hopes of reuniting her mother and grandparents, hence the found footage format. Along with Becca is her younger brother, Tyler, a kid who spends a good amount of the film rapping. As time goes by, the kids begin to notice strange behavior from their grandparents, particularly their grandmother after dark. They soon find out their grandparents are far from what they expected.My biggest problem with found footage movies has always been the shaky camera. I get it. Someone holding a camera who is running would shake the crap out of it. But when you mainly use that as your source of suspense, a shaky angle where our protagonist is running and screaming, it's a problem for me. This film unfortunately contains that trope but uses it to a lesser extent. The real thrills come from this movie in moments, flashes. A kind of did I just see what I think I did moment. The movie had it's share of jump scares, of course, but once again not overplaying it.The acting in this movie was fairly good in general, exceptional for a Shayamalan film. The only character I had a problem with was Tyler but his acting was well. He's a teenage boy with confidence, teenage boys with confidence are annoying, and he annoyed me, so kudos to the performance. Both Peter McRobbie and Deanna Dunagan do a great job of creeping you out as the grandparents but the star of this is Olivia DeJonge as Becca. It is through her perspective we mostly see this story and it's her performance that really stuck with me after I left the movie.Now on to the story, how it plays out, and most importantly, the twist.SPOILERS BELOW!!!So as the week of this visit goes on and the kids finally fear for their safety and call their mother to pick them up right away. After showing the elderly couple to their mother via Skype, the mom reveals those are NOT their grandparents. Turns out these people murdered the real grandparents and are assuming their identities. After this revelation the old people really start to lost their sanity and try to kill the children. The children survive, of course, and are reunited with their mother.As far as the twist goes, I liked it, it served the story well, but you could see it coming from a mile away. The entire time through the movie I thought that could be the twist and it was only confirmed with every scene where the mother could have identified her parents but she didn't. The other twist that I thought could have been possible was that this was all an elaborate prank on the children. And I gotta say, it would have been a GREAT movie albeit with a morbid ending if it were both. If the mom had driven up alone at the end instead of with the police and said, ""got ya! they ARE your grandparents!"" and these kids just murdered them? Awesome! It didn't happen but I wish it had.All in all, I rather enjoyed this movie. The suspense was good, the story was told well, but the twist was just too obvious. The movie had more good moments than bad. Yes, it was gross but that dirty diaper to the face scene was awesome. Some of the jokes didn't really land for me but comedy is the most subjective thing ever next to beauty so I can't fault the movie too much for that.I think that this was a step in the right direction for Shayamalan's career. Hopefully, this will lead him to having control once again of a studio feature. I think that this is a good movie for anyone looking for a decent scare or two for any occasion. A date, hanging with a buddy, or going to the theater with the family.6 out of 10 stars.",The Visit
317,allpavel,Worth to see.,6,30 July 2020,"The film was shot in the found-footage horror genre. Plot is about a brother (Ed Oxenbould) and sister (Olivia DeJonge), whom their mother sent to their grandmother (Deanna Dunagan) and grandfather (Peter McRobbie). In my opinion, Shyamalan managed to rehabilitate himself after previous films. He was able to make not a bad film. Cinematography is generally not bad for this genre. There are no questions about acting, the children got used to the role very well, each having their character, and the adults perfectly showed the distraught old people. The plot is standard and obvious. Worth seeing.",The Visit
318,philipmagnier,Don't Bother,4,16 September 2015,"This film did hold my attention for the entire viewing okay but really did not have a lot else going for it. It's a horror film with precious few moments of real menace: in fact, it almost seems that Shyamalan did not go for them.Another thing that puzzled me: why are the kids so unafraid when they're spending days with two people who go totally nuts every evening after 9:30? I admire Shyamalan for trying home movie making, just about, after recent setbacks. He picked two great child actors also, and the adults do more than justice to their parts. But this film doesn't even begin to mark a return to his heights in past films and he nastiness at the end feels very contrived.",The Visit

Worse, this is a complete waste of time and money. I was reluctant to write anything about it at all because simply doing this acknowledges its existence, which is way more than it deserves. But I noticed that some users gave extremely high ratings - which leads me to conclude that there are 3 possible reasons for this: first is the possibility that we were not watching the same movie. Second, maybe they have some ulterior motive, or third,...well I'm sure you can imagine what my third assumption would be...",The Visit

Two children visit their deranged grandparents and film the entire thing. Turns out the grandparents are murderers yet the idiot children still make a movie about them and film themselves even after getting a diaper full of sh*t mushed in their faces.What makes it even worse is after having a diaper full of sh*t thrown in one of the main characters faces he raps about how it tasted while dressed like a rap artist as his sister looks on laughing. Yes you read that correctly, a boy eats an elderly mans fecal matter and raps about it.Unrealistic.

322,KristianZacc,M. Night Back To Form?,6,30 September 2015,"Minor/Vague SpoilersAfter a long string of ""failures"", both in the eyes of critics and audiences, M. Night Shyamalan is back with found footage horror comedy ""The Visit"". Found footage has usually turned me off wanting to watch a film but this time it was bearable even though it had me questioning whether a little girl can create better film angles than a child Hitchcock probably could've, I just dismissed it. Essentially, the film is about two siblings, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler Jamison (Ed Oxenbould), visiting their grandparents who they have never met before due to their mother, played by Kathryn Hahn, being estranged from her parents and her daughter, Becca, is creating a documentary about this first encounter.Going into this movie I had heard people loving, hating it, and everything in between so I went and saw it to decide for myself. After it finished I would say that I would be somewhere in the middle leaning slightly more towards liking it. The comedy aspect in this film is something I wasn't expecting at all. Oxenbould, probably most famous in Australia for his role in Puberty Blues, was the star and it was due to him bringing the comedic aspect of this movie. Knowing he was an Australian made it even more impressive because he never let up on his American accent. I can see him going far in the industry in the future especially when comparing him to other child stars today. Olivia, also Australian, put in a great performance as well, she brings the drama side of this movie, especially, in one scene where it was her moment and she made it very real, adding depth to her character as well as the overall story in the small world they were in. Both kids carry this film and if they weren't as great as they were then this movie definitely would've suffered because of it. The two grandparents, Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie), were fine in their roles. Dunagan definitely tried her best to be strange/creepy/scary even before the clock ticked past 9:30. Sometimes it came off as forced and there were a few moments where I almost cringed at how obvious they were. Now to speak on the twist that Shyamalan is so famous for putting in his films, I saw it coming from one of the first sentences said in the movie and became more and more obvious and subsequent events happened. Even though I did see it coming I still was able to enjoy some of the other elements in the film. It wasn't a traditional horror film in that there weren't many scenes that actually scared me. Of course there were a few jump scares, which is to be expected with horror films nowadays. Some of them you could see coming but they were still annoying because it just seemed like it was a cheap way to get scares which of course they got from people in the cinema. Not that I was looking for a Halloween type of horror but the scene that I had heard most people talking about from the trailer was the ""clean the oven"" scene and this almost failed and almost took me out of the movie. Some of the scenes that were well done was when the children would hear sounds outside of their room. This was great as it made us, the audience, has to imagine what the grandmother could possibly be doing and that is the best kind of scare, in my opinion. As soon as the kids opened the door and we saw what was occurring it took away from that feeling and made it almost comical.

323,hugomf85,Oh no! Shyamalan does it again...,5,14 February 2016,"When i saw this title and realized this was a horror movie directed by Shyamalan and the pretty good IMDb rating i thought to myself ""this may well be Shyamalan's comeback!"" and rushed to see it. Well, it's not. First seconds into the movie and i see on screen ""written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan"", the ""written"" part disturbed me, i instantly was struck with the feeling this was going to be a horrible movie, but hey, let's give it a chance, he proved to be a great horror director in the past. Some minutes into the movie i see that the movie is not actually directed by Shyamalan, but instead it's a found footage film. So, you can imagine the disaster that follows. Terrible characters, very poorly written, mediocre acting to say the best, almost no soundtrack. I will not waste more time on this review and you should not waste your time watching this movie. Bottom line, the man is a horrible writer and good director, but you won't find his director skills in this movie.",The Visit
324,Demetrius_Stork,"Good elements, but overall not enjoyable",4,13 December 2015,"This movie was an interesting experience. It had elements that I really enjoyed and reminded me of a better time for Shyamalan. But overall this movie was a discombobulated mess that didn't come out, at all, like the film M. Night probably wanted.Let's start with good. The twist is done really well. I might even argue that it's the best in any Shyamalan film to date. The reason for this isn't necessarily because the actual twist is good either, it's more so because the film tricks you. The twist, in fact, isn't really that hard to predict, but the way it's done is fantastic. The film does this by setting up several other possible twists that are all very well done. Some of these possible twists are really silly and might not seem to make any sense. However, Shyamalan's awful track record actually works to his advantage in this film. This is because while some of the possible twists are stupid and impossible, Shyamalan has done things in film in the past that are stupid and impossible. This ironically makes these false twist, all the more plausible.Another positive factor in this movie is the character quirks. What I mean by this is the kids both have small quirks in their personalities that come into play later in the film. I really loved this element in Signs, another Shyamalan film, and I'm glad they incorporated it in this one. The quirk, as it did in Signs, also comes into play at the end, and supplies honestly one the greatest gross out moments in movie history, in my opinion.But now let's talk about the bad. The writing, for starters, isn't organic. It just sounds too ""moviesque"" it's just not how real people talk. Granted it's not necessarily awful, I do like how the girl is pretentious, because it makes perfect sense for a teenage girl, film maker to act in such a way. But at the same time while it makes sense, it's still really annoying.This movie isn't funny, plain and simple. Besides one hilarious line during a ""Yahtzee"" scene, this movie failed to make me laugh at all. The rapping sequences made me cringe, a trope that dates this movie to an insane extent.Speaking of the rapping scenes, the boy is so annoying in this movie. His character is stupid as hell, which only shows to Shyamalan's complete lack of understanding to kids (As seen in After Earth, Avatar, etc). But at the same time, they try to make him ""deep"" by giving him some stupid back story about a football game. There's a scene in particular at the end in which he has a burst of outrageous anger, it's hilariously bad. It isn't hinted at whatsoever throughout the movie and it just comes out of nowhere. But the worst factor of this movie, for me, is also the most important aspect of any horror movie, the scares. This movie isn't scary at all, it's almost insulting. Ninety percent of the scares are horribly telegraphed jump scares that couldn't scare any sensible person. Some of them even let you know, it almost seems on purpose, of when they're about to happen. For example, there's a scene where the grandma is running about the house. She runs in frame, then out of frame a few seconds later. Then the same thing happens again. Then again, all at the same time interval. Then suddenly, they try to scare the audience with a jump scare at the same time interval! It would be truly remarkable for any human being to be frightened by this scene, or the movie in general for that matter.In conclusion, not worth the watch. This movie just overall wanted enjoyable and really made me hate the found footage genre even more, which I didn't think was possible. M. Night Shyamalan should probably just stop making movies altogether by now and I can't understand how this guy keeps getting work.",The Visit
325,tochukwu-83206,I loved Ed Oxenbould rap spits.,9,8 February 2016,"You might not like this. Nah, you might not. For one, it is a found footage film-so also is Paranormal Activity: the ghost dimension and Project Almanac: films which came out last year. It is another entry that helps in bolstering the saturation of the found footage format. Furthermore, ""The Visit"" is about wannabee film maker Becca and her junior brother Tyler and the week they spent at Ma and Pa's house. So, for over an hour we get to see how they boringly take the camera up and down in a farm house-from the underbelly of a barnyard to the basement. And unfortunately, is jam-packed with brother-sister squabbles and arguments.But director M Night Shayalaman seems to have found strength in his directorial abilities using this small scale production film as a trigger. Truthfully, it is quite hard to classify this as horror because it gets past all that goo, bloodshed, and logical explanation of supernatural reasons for present circumstances. Though it has traces and appearances of the above elements here and there intertwined with criminal predisposition. It is eerie, but not downright scary or unwatchable due to horrific detailing. It has no major jump scares, but is boastfully unsettling.The lengths at which M Night Shyalaman goes to make sure that the hand held cameras are in the right places is not conspicuous as first. Not until you see a character: the aspiring film maker Becca interviewing another character, before the camera pans back to her and then you ask yourself, ""what of the second camera?"". Then, you realise that it has been there all along. Films like this is what we try to envision in our minds how the director goes about calling the shots: ""Action"" and ""Cuts"". Looking at it from another perspective, M Night Shyalaman is the secondary director, while the character Becca takes up the primary responsibility because of the specifics involved to make it look real and seem as if a bunch of kids are toying around with a newly acquired camcorder.There is this particular scene where something like pap falls on Becca's laptop and coats her laptop's webcam. She tries several times to remove it, but it doesn't or that particular scene where Tyler complains of an unseen stain in his hand, which he tries to remove incessantly without success. These scenes come before the screaming-around third act, but what fascinates is how they interestingly imply what is to come. And then in the next scene, things move back to normal. Sort of!Deanna Dunagan and Peter Macrobbie play Nana and Pop pop with so much innocence and naturalness that it is hard to fancy them as the villains (not sure if that is the right word). But when their scheming begins, you begin to pray that those moments are in split seconds rather than the allotted 15 minutes where they torture the kids. Prior to this, the build up is slow, sharp and doesn't say it directly to your face: ""this is what is going to be"". An example is when Nana interrupts the hide and seek game of the kids in a devilish weird way-underneath the foundation of a building. That scene stood out! Or is it that time where Nana asks Becca to go and clean pot-bellied oven capable of swallowing her and then it comes to our mind that she might probably close it before going for Tyler. Surprisingly, she doesn't. At the beginning of the final act, she asks Becca for the same favour and closes it. But at that point where we might say ""I knew this would happen"" in our minds, Nana opens it again. Brilliant!But ""The Visit"" falls for the courageousness trick: forgetting that there is a thin line between bravery and stupidity. I wondered why those kids wasted time in taking to their heels after being told by mum that ""Those are not your grandparents"". More so, it is silly because they had already gotten to the door before evil pop pop closes it due to a second hesitation. Silly! Clichéd also! However, it's not as if the film takes an A+ grade in being novel because it culls little elements from the Paranormal Activity franchise, but in scenarios that convincingly confirms why it should rather than on- the-nose incorporation.""The Visit"" pretends it is going to be dark, but it isn't. There are still related-to-plot character on screen presentations you are going to enjoy and not squeal at. Ed Oxenbould rap inspirations for example. In spite of his misogynist end to rap rhymes that ends with ""Ho"" and ""Bitches"", there is something about this kid that tells you he is going to have a successful rap career in the vein of Eminem assuming for once he is the owner of those rhymes. The swag, expression and passion he displays while spitting verses is worth sitting back and enjoying. I'd pay for that-anytime, anyday. Even in the end, before the end credits when it becomes all tears and hugs, he goes out with a bang insisting he raps before the film finally ends. Then of course, we know he isn't joking when he says ""Shit doesn't taste like chicken"". I replayed that scene twice before writing this review. I am probably going to watch it again after writing this review. Ed Oxenbould stands out as Tyler with his rap scenes.It might be too early to say that the dark days of M Night Shayalaman's career are gone after stinkers like (The Last Air bender) and (After Earth), but this is a return to form for the director giving us a film that coerces us to constantly predicts outcomes which never happens. For most of it anyway!",The Visit

327,FolkHorror,Great little horror gem,8,12 November 2018,"The VisitFormat: Amazon Prime Language: English Released: 2015Director: M. Night ShyamalanStarring: Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbieSomething I must confess before I start, I clicked on this film by mistake, but due to laziness on my behalf and the fact Kirk, (my dog) ran off with the control, I just couldn't be bothered to change it; which, as it turns out was a good thing, for I thoroughly enjoyed this little gem of a film.The film kicks off with Becca (Olivia DeJonge) interviewing her Mother (Kathryn Hahn), as to why she is not on talking terms with her parents. In this direct but short intro, you are not only given the full story of the family troubles and why they have them but also the plot and the style in which the story is told. This as it turns out, is shown entirely through the home recording of siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) in such an engaging way it adds to the end result and does not, as is with so many home recording style films, become boring or off-putting.What follows is a classic little story with so many twists and turns that it keeps you engaged (at least it did me) to such an extent you are genuinely caught off-guard at the end. This film is all about the story, which is a refreshing thing in these spoon-fed jump scares horror film times we are sadly made to endure. The hand held camcorder style of the film never once becomes annoying, the child actors are not only superbly portrayed by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould respectably, they are fully likeable and I really became concerned for them as the film when on. Without giving anything away, one scene in particular stands out for me.
When the siblings are in bed and you are shown something going on outside their bedroom door, it switches back in the room where they are debating whether or not to open said door, it had me shouting at the screen urging them not to do it!Such is Shyamalan's skill at direction, that this film is littered with these type of moments, it never becomes slow or repetitive but moves at such as pace it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Sometimes funny, sometimes moving, other times just downright scary, The Visit, never overstays it's welcome. This is reinforced by the characters in the film, as I mentioned before, the two siblings were portrayed perfectly but I feel I should also give a shout out for Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie for their portrayal of Nana and Pop Pop.This isn't to say that the film is perfect, it isn't; there are some areas that feel just a little out of place, some fillers that could have been edited out without anyone noticing but, the biggest gripe for me, was the 'post' ending. Again, without giving anything away, the film should have ended ten minutes earlier. The interview with the Mother at the end, explaining some answers to questions that where best left unanswered should not have been added; nor should the pointless 'funny' rap from Tyler at the end credits. This succeeded only in turning the film ending from a genuinely unnerving horror film to a film with a needlessly cheesy, family friendly ending, which was a shame.All in all however, if you ignore that post ending part, this film is a must for fans of horror, and driven mainly by a strong story and not jump scares or over-the-top gore, and is well worth your time.",The Visit

I didn't enjoy The Last Air Bender or Lady in the Water and I feel this film may be closer to the ones I didn't enjoy. Rather than the ones I did enjoy. Although he kept it genuine, with his homage to Pennsylvania and his inclusion of water. I feel he may have traveled outside of his normality to ease the minds of the haters. It has been a while since his last film and I think that there is a reason for that. The film could of been much scarier. Since the plot twist was excellent and may be one of his best. Rivaling The Sixth Sense. I feel that comedy can have a place in thrillers and horror movies, but too much ruins the film in my opinion. This film had a little too much for my taste and the live action filming was OK. I really enjoyed the acting of all involved. The young actors should have a promising career. Even though in this film, they seemed a bit too smart for their age and therefor you knew you were watching actors. Overall. I was bit disappointed, especially waiting a while for his next film.

The ""twist in the story happens at the 76 minute mark but by then I was too numbed to think it was surprising (I actually had an inkling of the twist in the first 15 minutes). I don't think it's the actors, it's the script that is lame and can't be saved by anything other than a complete rewrite.

There were some genuinely creepy scenes and circumstances in the film. I think some of the more super negative reviews on here are from people who are still angry at the director for his previous films. And that is very understandable. The man his released some films that were criminally bad. But this is not one of them.The movie falls in the genre of found footage even though it's not really so much ""found"" as it is footage. The daughter of a single mother wants to understand the bitter feelings between her grandparents and her mom. Mom's going on a cruise and the estranged grandparents have offered to look after the kids. Mom agrees because they are after all their grandchildren who should have an opportunity to meet their grandparents. This is not an improbable and crappy scenario from which to build a story. Haters are going to hate.This is a horror film. A for real horror film! It doesn't rely on stupid jump scares and loud bangs. There isn't even any background music! It's all very disturbing imagery without being gory and alarming behavior by the antagonists. It's a good movie! I never thought I would say that again about something made by M.N.S. Having said all that it's not perfect. I have watched hundreds possibly thousands of horror films. And the worst part of any great horror film is there ending. It's obviously the hardest thing in the entire world of filmmaking to stick the ending of a horror film. And like 1 million horror films before it The Visit stumbles right at the end. Despite that though it doesn't ruin the entire film and it's at least palatable and non-offending to your intelligence. M.

This mood set puts a damper over the entire film and glosses any perception and/or opportunity to see it as anything but terrible.The truth is that The Visit is a rare treat that we get from a genre that rarely gives anything new. A fresh story that is equally realistic, nightmarish; sort of a dark fairytale.The story is simple and easy to follow, the characters are well written and acted. The POV direction actually helps this film, as it goes with the story in a confusing fashion. We still get an AMAZING TWIST, and it is terrifying.Also, the best part of this is that it was a small budget film to make a comeback. This is exactly what it did.As with most films, it's not perfect but as for most horror films... it's different and still scary. Those two things make it an otherwise unique experience.In my honest opinion I think it went over too many heads.

335,asher-luberto,M. Night Shalaman reVisits good film making.,8,27 September 2015,"Shalaman goes back to his roots of filmaking, and delivers us his best film since Signs. For the past decade Shalaman has delivered some of the worst films the industry has ever seen. He has given us films like after earth, the happening, lady in the water, and worst of all ""the last airbender"", which was the worst movie I have ever seen. These movies were all a disaster and quite frankly scare me. In 2015, Shalaman delivers us an actual horror movie, that scares me for all the right reasons. The Visit is a horror/comedy that delivers the right amount of scares and laughs to make this a very good film. The acting in this film is phenomenal. The two kids do a great job, especially the boy. The boy in this film gives us the comedy aspect to the film, constantly delivering laughs. The grandparents do a great job of scaring the crap out of you, and even the mom (Kathryn Hahn) was great, despite not seeing her often in the movie. The cinematography was good, and gave the movie a surreal feel. And like all Shalaman flicks, there is a twist at the end, but this is a twist the old mind of Shalaman would have come up with, not the recent mind of Shalaman.In conclusion, If your a horror fan looking for a gory/junmp scare flick with awful acting then this is not for you. But if your looking for a well made movie that will scare you, then this is for you.",The Visit

Even the clothes in the end, the computer who would reveal the true identities to the stupid mother who goes in a holiday and sends her kids to live with people she does not speak to for more than 13 years and without ever have providing ONE single picture of papa and nana - the very much annoying way this kids that have NEVER seen their relatives always speak to and of them. This movie is all film with a moving hand camera, witch is to say the camera is always moving, the actor looks and talks into it and it's not even done in a way one believes it.The plot is supported by 2 kids, who have to go trough the intensity of a range of emotions they can't obviously get.

338,nillobit,Wildlike is Better than The Visit,3,27 September 2015,"Drama, fantasy, comedy - whatever the story genre, good ones have one thing in common. Truth. The story needs to tell the audience of something they know, something they have forgotten or something they can now imagine. Case in point, two films I've recently watched illustrate success and failure clearly. Both involve children being sent away by less than careful parents. I intend to post this review at the site of both films, because the contrast is clear. Wildlike & The Visit both are stories about children being sent away to visit with relatives, mistakenly, by troubled parents. Both are stories about horror, but, where one tells us about evil, the other tells us bad puns. In Wildlike we see a young girl sent away by a defective mother who can't handle taking care of herself or her child. In this movie we walk in this child's shoes and understand the choices she makes. The evil she faces is banal, quiet and could go unnoticed. We see the past and current trauma this child has endured in the acting and writing. The truth is this is everyday evil, the kind that we won't change without understanding it. In the Visit we see a sister and brother sent away by a mother distracted by her own issues. Children know when their parent's are not competent. It affects them and causes doubt and tension. Instead of reflecting that, these siblings are snarky, self involved, smart alecks who are not cautious, vigilant or concerned. The danger these kids face is overt and direct early on, but they seem not to take it serious. Neither can the audience. The truth in a similar film of M. Night Shyamalan's, the Sixth Sense, was not the horror the child faced, that only made the film compelling. The truth was about the adults learning to respect the child's view of reality. there is no such kernel in The Visit.",The Visit
339,jamamaes,That Twist!,7,26 September 2015,"I have heard a lot about the twist of the film and was very well done and was unexpected. With M night shyamalan getting a lot of stick about his other films rightly so it was good to see a film from him that was really entertaining. With he plot of the two children going to see there grandparents then weird things starting to happen it is not that creative but the execution of it was well done. I am not a fan of found footage but I can appreciate how it was carried out like this. I thought the performances of the main characters in the children were okay I did not care for the boy rapping didn't make any sense to have that in the film. The two grandparents performances were very good, could be difficult to act very strange the whole film. When you have watched a lot of jump scare horror films that are not very entertaining and then watch The Visit you will be happy you did as it has the occasional one but is more down to building up suspense of the relationship between the opposite sets of characters. Would recommend this film to anyone as I thoroughly enjoyed it and loved the dynamic of the film. I could say that one of the best horror's of the year with exception of It Follows as I enjoyed that a little bit more.",The Visit

343,The_Film_Anorak,M Night continues to slide downhill.,2,14 September 2015,"I haven't liked any M Night Shyamalan film since Unbreakable, and the quality of his output seems to have been on a downward spiral ever since then. Reliance on twist endings that got more lame with each outing soon got tired, then he dispensed with the twists and concentrated just on making films that were really terrible. So it was that I only ended up watching this film by accident. It was my daughter's choice of film and I'd agreed to see this and was in the car on the way to the cinema before I found out it was an M Night production, and in my seat before I realised it was a Found Footage film. These were the only genuine feelings of shock and dread that came out of the experience.This film is just very poor. It combines many things that have had their day and have become tiresome - M Night twisty plot lines, people who don't put the camera down even when they're in danger, manufactured attempts at scares by going quiet and then turning the sound up - and doesn't do any of them well.The plot is predictable and preposterous, and relies on what Roger Ebert used to call the Idiot Plot, a story that can only take place if no one has or uses common sense. The shocks are pretty feeble and there's no real sense of believable danger. M Night also seems to believe in a world where it's not just scary horror film old people who are scary, but in fact all old people. We're expected to believe that reasonably intelligent people (who know about films) would think that old people behaving exactly like scary characters in horror films are just regular creepy old people.Apparently M Night financed the film himself in order to have total creative control so he has no one but himself to blame how badly this film has turned out. The inexplicable good press this is getting and the reasonable box office performance means he will probably be encouraged to make more films, which is actually quite depressing.",The Visit

346,furtherdownfilms,The Visit - A Review by Nathan Fischer,8,14 October 2015,"M. Night Shyamalan wowed audiences with The Sixth Sense by catching everyone off guard. It was a finely tuned horror thriller with one of the most memorable twists to date. Since then he has made some exceptional films, and more recently, not so exceptional. I'm happy to report that he is back to his true form with The Visit. The Visit is a found footage style film about a mother who sends her two children, Becca and Tyler (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) to see their grandparents whom they've never met before. There is bad blood between the mom (Kathryn Hahn) and her parents and she hasn't seen them for 15 years. But after her children convince her to let them go, she sends them off. Becca, a 15-year-old aspiring filmmaker decides to document the whole trip with her 13-year-old brother's help.. After arriving to the house, the kids soon discover that there is something wrong with Nana and Pop Pop. The movie takes place over a week and the scenes change with large red titles telling the audience what day it is. I liked this. It came across as eerie and helped build the dread. The kid's leading the movie are perfectly casted. Becca and Tyler play siblings so naturally that I'd assume they were related in real life. The banter between the two is funny and accurate to their age. While they both do a terrific job, Ed Oxenbould as Tyler steals the show. The way he handles comedy and horror is timed perfectly. Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn do an equally solid job as Nana and Pop Pop. You can tell in the trailers that they seem creepy, but that's just scratching the surface. These are some scary old people.I found it a little surprising that M. Night decided to make this movie in the found footage style. He has always had a great eye for directing and I sometimes feel like this style film restricts a director's creativity. But I'm starting to change my mind. This style is just another method of story telling, and it's an effective one, especially for horror. This is a passion project that M. Night wrote, directed, produced and edited. And you can see that he had a good time making it. This is undoubtedly a scary movie with some truly terrifying moments, but its never stops being playful. I smiled as much as I was scared. So is there a twist? Is there this giant reveal? You're going to have to see for yourself, but it's a visit you'll be happy you took.",The Visit

I remember you promoting the film as the ""scariest movie you've ever seen""). I skipped over Avatar: The Last Airbender and After Earth for obvious reasons. After assuming and then ultimately knowing the last two would tank, it was no surprise to me that ""The Visit"" would be the directors lowest studio budget film. When the trailers first released, I found myself itching to see it. Luckily last night I was able to do so. Viewers expecting to see a pure horror or pure comedy will be disappointed, its truly a film that falls in-between the two. Without giving anything away, know that while its not his strongest film, it truly makes up for a couple of his last bombs. I laughed, I cringed, I jumped and I ultimately enjoyed this film.

Their Pop Pop btw, is so gross, he's pooping in diaper and collect all his poops in the shed, even actually, this thing makes me laughs when he puts his fresh poop on Tyler (the boy)'s face at the last part of movie, ha ha I don't know I found it so hilarious.. So gross, poor Tyler...The plot twist is so predictable too, from the moment Becca (the girl) said they don't know how their grandparents faces look like, I can know the grandparents they meet are not their real grandparents, especially if you're recently watching ""When a Stranger Calls"" type movie that tells you about ""the real dangerous person is living with you in the same house all the time since the beginning"".But this is not a bad movie, this is good movie, just not really entertaining.",The Visit

Night ShyamalanProduced: Blumhouse ProductionsRated: PG-13Oh my! M. Night Shyamalan is finally back after making few movies while being drunk. JEEZE, that grandma is scary. The Visit, is the director of Critically Acclaimed ""Sixth Sense"", which was really the only blockbuster hit. After giving out a back to back sci-if duds, Shyamalan has finally returned back to his thriller territory with this movie. This movie is a normal thriller, but it's done right.Becca(Olivia DeJonge) and younger brother Tyler(Ed Oxdenbould), leave to see the grandparents they have never seen. They head deep into Pensylvania, greeted by their Nana and PopPop and as a series of events follow, they wonder if they'll ever leave. First off, all the characters are very well developed. This movie is very lightweight, and all the performances are very well done. Ed Oxdenbould is funny and lightens up the mood at times, but he also has these few irritating humorless moments that really kills the spook. This movie also has a fair share of eerie and creepiness.This being M. Night Shyamalan's first low-budget movie, it's executed very well. All the performances are stout and the dialogue is fitting even though you do feel that humor isn't needed at some point. In the movie, there are some scenes when you will get irritated by the humor. You get the feeling that the humor killed the scariness, and that essentially it is a poor dialogue driven thriller- comedy. The creepiness and humor goes on and off at wrong places at the wrong time. Also, the movie is very repetitive at times and the screenplay slows. The screenplay slows down in the beginning and bores you. Many scenes are repetitive, but that's OK, because it's make sense. Towards the end, the best part of this movie is that you really care for the characters. You worry and carry a connection with them throughout the movie. The characters develop this special bond with family and each other that you really care for.This movie has definitely accomplished characterization Truthfully, this is also more of a survival movie too, and is very gripping. Overall, this movie is a nicely done thriller comedy. Do not use your brains. There are some negatives, but you can overlook them. Grab your popcorn and catch it before it runs out.

The bad lighting and the constant shaking of the camera, typical of camcorder footage, become really annoying from the beginning of the movie. Making a feature film this way seems to me a good way to spend as little as possible and appear innovative at the same time. I suppose the ending is stock for most horror films, but I would have liked to know just who those old people were and where they came from.

I bet you weren't as shocked since seeing the 6th Sense. Now let's leave Shyamalan's career a bit apart and dig into the movie a little bit. The Visit deals with the story of two kids,brother and sister, who are sent by their mother to their grandparents. They are played by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould, who are doing an extremely good job. They are sent there with a purpose, which I'm not going to spoil it for you now. After their arrival strange things start to happen and everything turns upside down. These things are seen through the eyes of the kids, because they are making a documentary about their grandparents. And yes, it's a found footage movie, it seemed as an odd choice for me at first, but it turns out that it suits very well the movie. Also being found footage, gives the movie a bigger dose of credibility. The camera angles used by Shyamalan are well chosen, contributing a lot to the building of tension. The kids reactions during these moments and in their aftermath are pure gold. The grandparents who are played by Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie are also contributing with a lot to these moments. Their acting is full of creepiness and also ambiguity. The final of the movie can't really live up to the rest of the movie, but it's neither as bad as the endings of other Shyamalan movies. Overall the movie is worth watching, because you either laugh yourself to death or either you're scared to death.",The Visit
358,lbishopkyo,M. Night Shymalan has redeemed himself; best horror experience in the theater of my life!,8,27 March 2016,"I remember seeing the commercials for this movie whilst watching Sharknado 3 (2015, that's a review for another day), and I immediately thought, ""I am SO seeing that! I don't even care if it's a Shymalan film."" As you know, M. Night Shymalan has released a lot of junk in the past few years (The Happening, Lady in the Water, The Last Airbender, After Earth, nothing superior since The Sixth Sense), but this film, surprisingly, is highly redeeming! It isn't the best film of the year, or of all time, but I remember when I saw it in the theater, I was at the edge of my seat.The twist ending, which I will not reveal if you haven't seen the movie yet, is something I, even as an experienced moviegoer, didn't see coming. There are clues that foreshadow the ending, like usual, but they at first don't seem important or worthy of remembering. Also, the action at the end was insane for a PG-13 rated movie. In my opinion, the best parts were the nighttime scenes in which we see what the grandparents are up to at night. They do the most bizarre, scariest, and most disgusting things, including, but not limited to, Exorcist-style vomiting while walking, scratching a door butt-naked, etc.Seeing this film in the theater was also the first time in forever I got scared during a horror movie. Normally, I seldom, almost never, get scared during a horror movie, since I love them so much. However, there is a jump-scare at one point, which, seeing on a big screen, did make me jump. But I laughed about it afterward.Overall, The Visit is not a perfect film, but seeing it on the big screen and being able to leave the theater saying it was great, is awesome. Even if not viewing it on the big screen, it's a movie you should check out if you're into horror and Twilight Zone-style twist endings. Also, if you have lost all faith in M. Night Shymalan, please, I beg of you all, watch this movie; you will regain faith in him. I did!",The Visit

I was really hoping for something different in this move, but it was not to be.Basically if you've already seen any other movie of this genre you're not going to see anything new. This has been done many many times before, especially by Mr. Shyamalan. And it cries out ""oh my gosh I've already seen this movie a thousand times"". I'm not a big fan of movies where the camera is a protagonist, but when done well I find it very pleasant. This movie is an example of it not having been done well. If the camera is a character, then there are numerous character flaws throughout. It's disappointing because when done right it's really good, but when it's not done right it's absolutely dreadful.The acting is so-so. I have a particular peeve about white boys trying to do hip-hop. It's cliché and very very annoying, again, unless done right. And this movie doesn't do it right. Putting that aside, most of the acting is so-so. Oddly enough, I thought some of the best scenes were done by Kathryn Hahn who has a relatively minor role in the movie. The ""main"" characters don't really do much to draw you in to the story. They're basically one-dimensional.I really wasn't entertained and I probably won't remember this movie after a few days. The only reason that I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because I reserve 1's for movies that I'll at least remember how terrible it was.

Night Shyamalan, who was previously responsible for the excellent The Sixth Sense and also Signs, which was another great film. The plot of The Visit concerns a young brother and sister, Becca and Tyler. Their mother decides to go on a cruise with her new boyfriend, so she sends the kids to stay with their grandparents, who they have never met and whom she has not seen for years. Soon after that, though, they notice strange things happening...I thought that this film was very strange and extremely boring. Literally, nothing happens at all during the entire film, there is virtually no horror or tension and I found myself looking at the clock every few minutes, wishing for the film to end. The young female lead uses strange words and language that I just didn't understand, so I found it hard to follow the film and the young boy who played her brother kept doing stupid rap songs, which soon became very irritating. The acting was okay, especially from the grandparents, which is the only reason why I am giving this two stars. It is still an awful film, though, so how the hell this receives a rating of 6.2 on IMDb is totally beyond my comprehension. The Visit is proof that the once great Shyamalan has lost his way and should consider another profession, because he no longer seems capable of making a decent film. Mr Shyamalan, if you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself. I have seen better DTV films than this and how the hell it ever got a cinema release, I will never know. A total abomination on every level and the critics who praise this must have seen a totally different film. I give it two stars, but even that seems too generous.

His following films ""Unbreakable"" (2000), ""Signs"" (2002) and ""The Village"" (2004), also got a bang for their buck. The following four films he directed after ""The Village"" bombed both with his fans and at the box office, with ""The Happening"" (2008) barely making back it's money. Many entertainment pundits predicted this was the end of his film career.Now Mr. Shyamalan is trying to make himself relevant to Hollywood again. His latest film, ""The Visit,"" isn't his best film, but it's also not so bad either. It's also his cheapest film to date, not counting the first two films he directed before ""The Sixth Sense,"" made for a mere five million bucks. Hopefully this will leave him more room to at least break even, unlike his more expensive flops.The film consists of a documentary two children, a 15-year-old girl and an 13-year-old boy, decide to make of their visit to their grandparents and the premise is that we're watching their product, similar to the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise, which, by the way, is produced by the same production company, Blumhouse Productions. It starts with a single mother in her mid-30s (Kathryn Hahn) who reveals to her daughter filming her that she ran away from home fifteen years earlier after a falling-out with her parents and that she cut off all communication with them. She doesn't say what led to her leaving them, but also tells her that her parents looked her up on the Internet and have invited their grandchildren to come spend a week with them at their Pennsylvania farmhouse. Reluctantly, the mother sends her two kids off hoping to build bridges with her estranged family.The children consist of teen daughter Becca and her younger brother Tyler, played respectively by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould, both fresh out of Australia. Becca is a high-school freshman and Tyler is an aspiring rapper. Both are greeted warmly by their grandparents who meet them at the train station. Their grandfather is referred to as PopPop (Scotland's Peter McRobbie) and their grandmother as Nana (Deanna Dunagan). Upon their arrival the children bring their own DSLR cameras to continue their documentary, as well as their laptop, which they use to keep in contact with their mother via Skype. The grandparents appear to come off as nice, but also require the grandchildren to observe one ground rule: they need to be in bed by 9:30pm. A minor inconvenience, but the children grudgingly agree.On their first night, strange things already start to happen. Becca wakes up to go down to the kitchen to get something to eat. She brings her laptop equipped with a camera hoping to document more useful things for their film, only to find Nana walking across the hallway and throwing up on the floor. That's the first of many strange things surrounding their grandmother. Their grandfather isn't any better. One time he takes his grandkids to their mother's childhood school, only to confront an innocent passer-by across the street whom he wrongly accuses of spying on them. Both grandparents gradually engage in behaviors that come off as very strange and worrisome to the grandkids at first, but then become more menacing and threatening. There are plenty of ""what the hell"" moments, as well as moments that will have you shaking your head, one of them being when Nana puts Becca in an awkward situation by requiring her to climb into an oven to clean it. And of course, what's a horror film without a few cliché jump scares? The film also has it's funny moments, Tyler especially is a riot. At times when Becca tries to include Nana in their documentary, she tries to find out from her what happened that lead to their mother leaving them, only for Nana to go into a conniption fit, prompting Becca to cut the interview short. Unbeknownst to the children, the grandparents have a story that will eventually lead to them fighting to survive their weeklong stay.While I've seen better films made by Mr. Shyamalan, ""The Visit"" is a fairly good effort for him seeking redemption from people who have all but written him off. There might be some hard-core fans that may be disappointed in the sense that this film is not like any of his earlier more successful work. Some may be disappointed that this is just another ""found footage"" film. This is a movie with a twist that will catch you off guard.One thing is certain. After watching ""The Visit,"" you'll never feel the same way about the board game Yahtzee again.",The Visit
365,boclani,Shymalan's forgotten gem,10,22 November 2016,"THE VISIT, directed by M. Night Shyamalan is a about a girl, Becca, and a boy, Tyler, that while their mother is on holiday, visit their grandparents for the first time. These grandparents are a bit weird and a bit, creepy. The girl, Becca, films ""interviews"" and documents her trip because she aspires to be a documentarian. And this movie is filmed in found footage format as we see through these kid's eyes, though their camera. And without words you can tell who you're looking through in the way they move the camera, Becca is a bit more professional with her stabilization of her video when Tyler isn't. Small factors like Tyler being a germaphobic and Becca being afraid to look at herself in the mirror all play out conclude this movie in great fashion and it all kind of meant something in the end.This movie is full of these little touches that change the whole experience, not as many little touches like his masterpiece The Sixth Sense, and I am going to compare this to The Sixth Sense, because this is definitely his best work after some of his, um, horrible movies recently. I hadn't seen a Shyamalan movie when I watched this for the first time. I've now watched it twice. And seen his best work. But the first time I didn't expect this film to have as many laughs as it did. This movie has times where it is funnier than any other comedy I've seen recently. Not in a bad way either. This movie is meant to have jokes in it.This is something that M. Night is great at - creating something unexpected and different. Whether it be his best film or his worst film, he has tried to do something different. It really caught me by surprise because I was laughing one scene and screaming the next, even at the same time! And the blend between both genres really gelled and was probably the best factor of the film.The twist isn't a Sixth Sense twist movie changer, but is a surprise if you haven't been paying attention. The twist is said in a very effective way that gave me goosebumps. Some non sensical decisions are made, in most horror movies to create more tension, but here it was just stupid. For example one scene Nana goes crazy from speaking about the mother and is actually really scary, then a little bit later, after more creepiness and life threatening experiences, the daughter asks her, the same thing?! Why would you do that? Some stupid decisions brought the rating of this down.But really, aside from some of the director decisions with the actors on set, I love Shyamalan's choice of them. Bruce Willis, Toni Collette and Osment from The Sixth Sense were masterful together. They added little details to enhance the mood of the performance and create emotion to hit the audience.It reminded me of The Visit actors while watching The Sixth Sense, because the acting on the most part is great. The grandparents are both loving and frightening and play both tones very well. These guys are in their mid seventies and they give some of the best performances I've seen all year. But the kids, the protagonists, are incredible. They are both so real and interesting. They're both Australian and they give off American accents so well, I sound like an idiot trying to speak as well as they did. Even though it isn't as emotional as Osment's performance in The Sixth Sense, you still feel as if these are just some kids that are documenting their trip, which is where the great use of found footage comes into play. The whole movie is supposed to be the daughter's edited trip documentary and I thought was very clever and adding, that a piece of music is played at the start briefly and also at the very end of the movie. Giving off more realism, much like the effect of The Blair Witch Project.The movie has hidden messages in it, on top of the comedy that surprised me also. This movie has a lot of character and depth to it. There are some really touching scenes with the mother and daughter that reminded me a lot of the character arc with Osment and Toni Collette, mother and son. I found it having the same effect as the emotional The Sixth Sense scene, it is still great to see Shyamalan slowly coming back to form and bringing emotion into a horror movie.Shyamalan's at his best doing these low budget horror films, instead of huge Hollywood movies that don't really work.The Visit is scary because it takes time to build suspense. The movie doesn't revolve around half naked girls who get eaten by giant piranhas that jump scare the audience whenever they feel like it. This movie is about, forgiveness, loneliness, and pure terror as this could happen in real life!It is not the next Sixth Sense and even though it sounds like it's trying to be, some similarities. It's not. They are two different types of movies. Other than bad decisions made by characters that make some scenes slightly annoying to watch, much like The Sixth Sense this is a different type of movie, that fits into many genres and categories with a mixture of beautiful scenes, laugh out loud comedy, and frightening moments. It is so refreshing. This is a really fun movie, with replay value, not for hidden messages, but just because it's a whole lot of fun!9 / 10",The Visit
366,swchamberlain,What septic tank did we fish this out of?,2,31 March 2016,"I gave it a 2 because there were times when the movie did actually creep/gross me out. Other than that where do I begin... Firstly I am not sure if I can release any spoilers because you know what happened, and how it is going to end, within the first ten minutes of the movie. The children are blindly caught in a situation, caused by their own loving mother, where they go on a visit with people that the mother hates enough to not even speak to for 10 or 15 years, maybe longer. The mother is totally OK with sending her underage children off, cross country, without ever speaking to the care givers, because she cant stand them, never checks up on her children's safety, never makes sure they even arrive in the right place, and then defends the people, that she cant stand, when the children speak up about it. To top it off she then wonders how this could have ever happened to her like it is some big surprise and we are supposed to feel bad for her. Meanwhile the kids are obnoxious, and relentlessly annoying the entire movie, they try to come across as highly intelligent but then do things that make you want to run head first into a brick wall, multiple times, so that maybe you can slap them in the head during one of your comatose dreams. I was actually rooting for the bad guys during this film, they deserve a pat on the back, no sane person would ever last as long as they did. There were times where I was slightly creeped out, like I said, but it was few and far between. What they couldn't accomplish with the creep out they tried to make up for with toilet humor which is always a winning combination. Then they tried to save the big surprise ending to the last minute, even though you saw it coming a mile away. It was actually insulting, but that is the long and the short of it. I could say more but it wouldn't be anything good, just don't waste your money like I did.",The Visit

I know, like an entitled and spoiled teenager dealing with senior citizens, which this movie tries to start off as, I was a little put out. And then there was the, oh no, not another movie using 'the perspective of a hand-held video camera' plot. Aside from some weird behavior from the gramps, I spent the whole movie waiting for something interesting or scary to happen. The scary part of the movie, was that I watched the whole thing and then logged in to comment on it. Boo! Too bad they did not use more of Kathryn Hahn, the only bright spot in this truly tedious non-horror, non-humor, non-interesting bore of a movie.",The Visit
368,Sean_Friel,A surprisingly fun film,8,29 April 2020,"Working with a 5 million budget M. Night Shiamalan definitely exceeds most peoples expectations.After searching through Netflix late one night in hopes of a good horror I stumbled across this little gem.The Visit tell the story of two children who meet grandparents for the first time whilst their mother is out of town. After positive beginnings things start to go very wrong quick.The film dips into the found footage film that we have seen brilliantly implemented in films such as The Blair Witch Project (1999) and Cloverfield (2014). Despite this similarity the film is fairly original.The film uses a lot of jump scares that effective I for one can say I was certainly scared. One of the main reasons for the films terror is Deanna Dunagan as Marja Bella Jamison (Claire), also known as ""Nana"". Dunagan is brilliant in her role and truly terrifying.For all its scares the film could actually be categorised as a comedywith the lovale rapping Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) providing much of the comedic relief.The Visit is an excellent film. It is very well written and enjoyable throughout.",The Visit

371,NoloContendere,"Mildly entertaining, but nothing special",4,13 June 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan continues to chase his glory days of The Sixth Sense. None of his films since have been as tight and edgy (or even made any sense -- I'm looking at you, ""Signs""!), and ""The Visit"" continues that slow spiral.The premise of the film is sound and the actors are all pretty good. I especially enjoyed the kids; I thought they did a great job with what they were handed in the script. But the pace was too slow and filled the time with too little of substance. Sure, there were some spooky parts, but ""spooky"" is the best that could be said for them. Too often, they were thrown in as a disjointed jumble and didn't effectively build on each other, giving the viewer's blood pressure time to recede to pre-spook levels. The inevitable M. Night plot twist was too little, too late; my 15 year old and I predicted it after the first 45 minutes of the film. The levels of frenetic tension and urgent sense of doom that should have carried the last third of the film never materialized.Overall, I'd say this is a formulaic piece with too many gimmicks (like the ""Blair Witch""-esque found footage) and too little editing. Alfred Hitchcock could have taken this film and had the audience wetting themselves with half the time and a third of the trite gimmicks.",The Visit

Many things could've made the film better: better acting, 80% of the film not filmed with the Blair Witch Project style, and most of all, a better twist ending that may explain why the grandpa put a gun in his mouth and the reason WHY the grandma went crazy!!!

And boy was I disappointed, the movie was not funny, not scary at all and there wasn't really a big twist like M. Night Shyamalan is known for. All in all giving this movie 2 stars is being generous. There were some jumps in the movie, but only when things popped up. The movie was also quite slow to get started. The characters were unimaginative, and the plot while decent failed to deliver any good punches. I am used to a M. Night Shyamalan to deliver but he did not in this movie.

Know that you must watch the film twice to fully appreciate it; I'll assume that approximately zero percent of film ""critics"" took this action, which is reflected in many of their reviews (which frequently mention ""comedy"" elements). There's nothing funny about the grandparents here, which can only be understood upon revelation of the ""twist,"" and the second viewing, as mentioned, when everything is clear.

With this movie, he is back. I had heard there was comedy but it is not like you think. It is more comedy relief and we need it because the movie is so tense, it really is a thriller and keeps you anxious through out. Great vibe.Do yourself a favor and do not read too much about the plot, let is surprise you and go in fresh. There is a thread of dread all the way through this movie. The acting and story was excellent all around.This movie is under-rated score-wise. it deserves a higher rating (even though the rating isn't too bad but it should be higher).

378,candice-l-clark,Refreshing,8,27 February 2017,"It's so refreshing to see an original horror come out of Hollywood these days. The film starts in a light-hearted fashion and we are introduced to 2 kids (with a very advanced vocabulary and film- making knowledge for their ages!) who are sent on a trip to visit their grandparents who live on a remote farm in Pennsylvania. Strange events ensue and the fear factor is heightened when we realise the grandmother has a condition termed 'sundowning' which makes her develop some rather strange nocturnal habits. This film doesn't actually show you anything that scary, it's more the sense of what's coming and the underlying reason for the strange behaviour. The twist towards the end is very effective and makes you feel true fear for these kids who go from annoying to likable as the film progresses. The film jumps between horror and comedy to a great effect and I found myself going from laughing to covering my eyes just seconds apart. The acting is top quality and the use of relatively unknown actors is very effective. This feels like a sub- horror genre unto itself and I hope to see more like this from M. Night Shamalan (whose films I usually find rather hit and miss).",The Visit

This isn't a typical cheesy comedy/horror, it doesn't try to be but it doesn't take itself too seriously either. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in ages and both myself and my daughter laughed until we had tears rolling down our cheeks.I take back what I said about the boy, that kid made this movie funny..both him and the Grandma had me falling about laughing and I couldn't breathe because I was laughing so much.I rate this a 10 because this is the first movie of 2015 that I really and truly enjoyed.

I really have little to say except I wish I had seen the cost of the film first would have realized there couldn't be much to it, and indeed there wasn't. Even less. Once you knew what was happening (after an hour into it) there was nothing else to say but beware the awfulness that follows. It is a shameful waste of film, cast and crew and Universal should not have allowed it to be distributed. Horrible horrible movie. IMDb says I have to have ten lines to submit this - The movie is not worth two lines, sigh, but it is about two youngsters sent to their grandparents for a week while their Mom frolics with her boyfriend. They began to notice changes in the oldsters and tell Mom but she advises calm. The audience is made aware that on two visits by outsiders from town, the grandparents are ""not at home"" - we're not shown where they are but the assumption is that they are out for a walk or something. Once the major plot twist occurs all hell breaks loose (loosely speaking) and the Mom after a skype call becomes agitated and advises the children to be careful. Still an awful movie. Wouldn't even make a good short story over ten pages. It didn't make sense (why the grandparents were weird) and well I'm stopping now because I'm getting a headache thinking about it.

Some moments of this film are simply eye roll worthy, just because of how often we see the same thing happen in other movies.The plot moves along rather unevenly, and by the end it is simply a relief that the film is over.I will however give it the 'creep' factor, with a few bits that were genuinely unnerving. But again, the majority of the jump-scare-esque horror that comes with the found-footage style is rather predictable.The twist (as there always is one in his films) is pretty average and I even thought, because it was so average, that there was going to be another twist to rectify the actual one.

Deanna Dunagan is beyond creepy, but she was a good actress in general. She was more than just creepy. I didn't like that I was told that there was a twist, because I figured it out early. The one thing that I was a little confused about was that I felt like the grandma was made to seem evil and demonic, but then they said that she was from the hospital and she was a murderer, but they never explain her weird movements that don't seem human.

Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art.

Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the ""comic book"" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me.",The Visit
392,Niik_Flix,A pleasant visit.,8,4 February 2016,"Forget the blood soaked sadistic films that people rage over every year. This is a seriously disturbing and perfectly freaky flick. loved it! most people are scared to get in the water after seeing jaws, I'm scared to visit my grandparents house at night now... maybe thats not such a good thing. This film doesn't rely on a the stereotypical crutch that horror does today. there is no shock value, they aren't trying to make your jaw drop from someones organs being ripped out or demon possession, elderly people are scary enough if they want to be. I also hate movies that are filmed from the perspective of a home video, but this was done right! It had its mise en scene and didn't make me want to hurl from shaky cameras. The acting was very good, nothing over the top or amateur, it was very believable. I'm not a huge horror fan, but I'm definitely going to buy this one. M. Night is starting to become one of my favorite directors and I hope to see some more of his work. The objective is suspense, not gore and demons.",The Visit

394,nikhilparatkar,Bad Writing,3,13 November 2017,"I'm not going to comment on the plot. That's an entirely different discussion but the two kids were so bad at acting that I stopped watching it twice in the middle. It shouldn't have been very hard to write the kids' part but somehow, the writer just forgot that they are kids and gave them amazingly unrealistic lines. The two actors may not be so bad at acting but here, either they did a terrible job or the director made them act so stupid.",The Visit
395,BBB,Alzheimer's Is Scary,7,14 September 2015,"""Paranormal Activity"" worked on the premise that unexplained noises and long, dark hallways are creepy & scary. ""The Visit"" worked on the premise that old people who act weird are creepy & scary. I think that works on a certain level because we're not just observing this scary behavior but one day we'll also be engaged in it.I could have done without the white kid rapping (that stopped being funny 30 years ago) and the schmaltzy, feel-good, ""tinkly tinkly"" music ending. I might also have preferred a supernatural ending, but it was worth it to get the plot twist.It's good to see M. Night make his first worthwhile movie since ""Signs.""",The Visit
396,nithinrajagopal,"Not fresh, but served well.",6,20 September 2015,"The idea is not entirely new. The theme of the movie is similar to this 1999 Bollywood flick titled ""Kaun?"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195002/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) that translates into ""Who?"". In fact, Kaun? engaged the audience differently and IMHO, told a similar story better. Also, ""Kaun?"" might have been one of the first real-time movies made in India which makes it extra special. The events in Kaun? unfold during the course of a rainy night.But Shyamalan serves the movie well. He moves the camera a lot in ""The Visit"" as if to make it up for the ultra-steady shots he has mostly stuck to all this while. The perspective is the kids' experience. The junior actors are very good (though the characters they play might seem to be a little too smart for their age) and the senior actors play it with incredible ease.With some good thrills coupled with humor, Shyamalan ensures that the movie keeps you engaged. A 6 out of 10 from me.",The Visit
397,ChristinaBarrett-USA1986,Another Disturbing Movie,1,18 September 2015,"I was very excited to see this ""different"" type of horror show.The kids at the beginning were so unceasingly annoying I had to think of a counter-attack. So, I said, ""Snotty kids,"" to myself whenever they turned me on at 1st.It was interesting to see the old lady at night. The old man was usually pretty nice.The only other interesting thing was disturbing, as well, seeing the real grandparents in the chest, dead. There was the lady before that hanging, too.I didn't, of course, ""like"" some of the ""Hollywood"" and ""other"" messages in this, so when the end came and they united with the police and mother, I was happy.So, naturally, the overtone messages weren't put there for me to like, but I didn't have as much a struggle with this as I have in the past. The messages were a bit worse, but I was in a better fighting mood.I grew to like the actors. For instance, the kids were very hopeful about life. I did notice the girl started off looking more Swedish and then looked more German and seemed very attractive in this way. I figured she looked serious usually because she was concentrating on her Swedish part, or whatever it could be.",The Visit
398,lizzieborden-246-354311,Enjoyable movie - watch this open minded,9,6 January 2016,"I gave this movie a 9/10, simply because I really enjoyed watching it and was never bored for a second.I would have probably given it an 8/10 normally, but the low ratings by other users bugged me immensely, so there is an extra point feeling ""The Visit"" being treated unfairly. And yes, this is a typical example of linking the director's name to certain expectations/viewing experiences while this movie should be watched open-minded as a creative work standing for itself. Calling it ""worst movie ever made""? -- C'mon! Even if this isn't a big budget production or anything like that at all, it's still well made and works on several levels.Why? - humour: if it weren't for the humour, the film could've been like any other horror flick; I really enjoyed that it didn't take itself too seriously and the mix of funny and scary moments; I also enjoyed the two quirky/nerdy kids as lead characters - suspense: this movie is not the re-invention of horror, granted; but there were scary moments enough without being gory; and of course the suspense is kept up until the end by the feeling of ""something weird"" going on; I actually liked the plot twist (it made sense) and didn't guess it until it came out.acting: especially the two young actors played their roles superbly, I felt, carrying the whole film as brother and sister; I liked the girl's performance as much as the boy's, both of whom we will likely see and hear more in the future.Setting, music and camera handling can be mentioned in addition as devices making this a success.Great movie for a slow Sunday evening.",The Visit
399,TheMarvellous,This had potential.,5,19 August 2020,"This could have been a great film but was let down by the children. Considering we spend the majority of the film with them, they are not easy to be around.

I was really looking forward to this after seeing the trailer, but was left disappointed and uninterested by the actual film. The post movie credit rap scene is cringey too.",The Visit
400,rgs927,Definitely not his worst. Also not his best.,5,31 May 2017,"There are people out there that say this movie redeemed M. Night. There are others out there that say this film was the cinematic equivalent of telling off his detractors. Lets be real- it's just a movie. Like any other movies, it has its highs and lows.The high points of this movie make for some decent horror moments. Well done jump scares (I'm normally not a fan of jump scares so consider this high praise). Solid camera-work, which surprised me. Good tension-building moments. Decent pacing, mostly. A decent payoff at the end of the major conflict, though one that does comes with some issues.The low points really left me scratching my head at times. The quirks of the children- the daughter being a documentarian giving much of the film a found-footage style, and the son being a rapper are ridiculous and painful, respectively. The twist ranks among the laziest of horror clichés. The tension turns sour in the end when it takes forever for the kids to do anything in the name of self-preservation once they know what's going on. What few supporting cast members we get range from useless to annoying, there to drop unsubtle hints about the twist, to mug for the documentary camera, or to encourage the son to rap. Lastly, the film could've ended several minutes earlier, but instead subjected us to scenes of a cliché family drama story, and more of the son trying to be a rapper.Overall, I recommend seeing this movie once. There are some genuinely well put together scenes and scares. There's some well-done film-making that does remind me of M. Night's early works. Just realize, you're going to have to put up with some glaring flaws as well.",The Visit

Unfortunately though, you can only make old people so scary, which is a serious obstacle that ""The Visit"" has to overcome. They didn't execute it well and the grandmother just simply was not scary. Personally I feel like to make up for the non-scary grandmother they threw in this random plot twist that they ""weren't the real grandparents"", which is where I get my comment title ""It was trying too hard"". I would have understood if the grandparents went completely psycho due to disorders or another reason, but for them to throw that in there was basically the story writer shouting ""The rest of this movie was bad and I'm backed up against a wall, so let me change the entire story in hopes to get good reviews from the audience"".

I have seen so many 1/10 reviews and statements on here suggesting this film is trash and I find that Ridiculous. While this is no Sixth Sense it is still a step back in the right direction for a very interesting director. I found the story line very intriguing once it got going and was actually very creeped out by some of the eerie scenes. I admit the first 5-10 minutes I thought the child stars were a little annoying, especially the rapping teenage boy lol just no! But as we got into the tale I grew to like the two characters more and started to feel a sense of dread for the predicament they are in. The acting is quality throughout and the two older actors who play the grandparents are legitimately quite scary. I had to stick up for this film as some of the reviews are so extreme. I enjoyed this movie so much more than a lot of others out right now. Also the found footage aspect of this film is good, I normally hate the shaky, blurry found footage movies. I don't care if the camera work being poor is more realistic I like to see what's going on at all times. So if you like M Night's movies aren't stuck up and just want to enjoy a creepy film with a nice twist at the end. I say give it a go!",The Visit

405,don_spielberg,Shyamalan regains form,7,10 September 2015,"First off, I am one of the few Shyamalan fanboys in the world. Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village and even the Happening being some of my favourite movies. So I always get excited to hear he is back at work. The Last airbender and After Earth, proved that this underrated genius needed to go back to basics and stick to his own work. He has done so and has, for me, succeeded.The Visit is stunningly beautiful, and yes it is a 'found footage' sort of movie, with the main character, Rebecca, being an aspiring filmmaker, she sets up amazing shots which bring a certain feel to the movie. One thing MNS always manages to bring to the table is an amazing picture.The acting is beyond superb, Olivia De Jonge (Rebecca) is incredibly talented, but the show stealer is rapper/ladies man Tyler, played by Ed Oxenbould bringing some much needed comic relief to counter the tense atmosphere of the movie.Nana and Pop Pop set the mood slowly, the tension builds at every interaction, and one thing is certain, they will make you hesitate to send your kids away to their grandparents at the next school break.Not wanting to give away too much, I will finish by saying, there is a very slight MNS trademark twist, maybe more obvious than his previous ones, but overall this is a stripped down basic fabulous horror piece, that will keep you on edge and make you paranoid of old folks when leaving the cinema. Shyamalan is back on form and has stepped up his game after the terrible big studio movies he helmed recently. A truly original piece, it is definitely worth watching.",The Visit

I really cant believe I gave Night another opportunity at my money. What is more surprising is the number of people and critics that think this film is worth more than 1 star.The kids do a good job at acting their over scripted parts. Although the boy's part I believe was not well cast.At best this is a poorly shot mix of Blair Witch and Paranormal, but both of those films were actually scary and fun to watch.The craziest part is that the first weekend gross was over $25 million.

Regarding the plot holes, if you have paid attention to what the visitors coming to the house say, they are literally contradicting the plot twist in the manuscript. For true horror seekers this is not the one, the general feel of the movie is fun and happening at day time.

408,velvetkevorkian610,The Twist You Never Expected,7,20 September 2015,"The real twist here is that for more than a decade M. Night Shyamalan has built up a beautiful fecal mountain of great terrible movies, then marketed The Visit as possibly the holy apex of said ****-mountain, and somehow the movie turned out to be his non-ironic best since the days his name wasn't considered a joke. I feel like every movie he's released since Signs has been a piece of performance art leading to this ultimate mind bending twist ending where the movie with the worst trailers possibly ever turned out to be decent.Bravo, Mr. Shyamalan.The real key here is that Shyamalan has finally shed the comically serious attitude all his movies have had to this point. The Village, The Happening, Devil; they were all ironic comedy gems because the tone was so serious but what you saw on screen was an absolute joke. This movie incorporates a lot of intentional comedy that has you laughing WITH the characters rather than at them. The dialogue is Shyamalan's best probably ever. So you bond with the characters and enjoy yourself. Then when the suspenseful moments come, you are surprised that you actually care about the characters and the suspense is working. The twist was obvious and you could forecast it a mile out, but with Shyamalan you can't really avoid that.Overall, it's no masterpiece of course, but as an ironic Shyamalan lover over the past 10 or so years, I can confirm that I actually agree with his non ironic fans who are calling this his return to form. The trailers are extremely misleading and the movie is nowhere near as ridiculous as the ""Get in the oven"" trailers would have you believe. Solid 7/10.",The Visit
409,theterroroutofplace,Creepy yet hacky,4,21 March 2016,"I couldn't bring myself to like this movie, no matter how hard I tried. The children were thoroughly unlikeable and the scares were cliché. The blend of horror and comedy which works so well in other films seems jarring as it stumbles around the found footage genre. Conceptually this film would have made a decent TV episode of The Twilight Zone but it feels a little padded out even at the relatively short run time of 90 minutes. There is real tension built in this film but it's discarded with absurdly cheap jump scares. Essentially the comedy in this film feels a bit like a bad dad joke.

I'm not against thinking for yourself, but there were sections and scenes that needed fleshing out more, why was her jumper on inside out, what is the significance of the 21:30 curfew when odd behaviour happened throughout 24 hours, why did the police not think to visit an elderly couple when they didn't show up at the local psychiatric hospital for their reliably weekly voluntary counselling sessions at exactly the same time that two inmates had escaped?

Night Shyamalan, Blum's horror work, & Horror-Doc style film-making, this was certainly an original piece of work in all aspects! For once a Docu-Style horror/comedy- thriller that isn't really about possession, or some kind of dark entity...it is literally what it is...a 94 minute feature of wacko's who are so literal you don't even know it's believable! I am very picky with horror-comedy (preferring Wes Craven's Scream quadrilogy as an amazing example of a perfect horror/comedy-thriller). This feature does an amazing job with character development (which some of these types of horrors lack), cinematography/framing for a modern docu-horror piece, amazing acting, an original story-line that isn't completely predictable at a least 50/50 ratio, & the running time of the feature was well used! Didn't feel too long, but not too short either! Of course M. Night's dazzling twist was completely unexpected and brilliant! I appreciate M. Night trying something new with working on a piece with one of the top horror filmmakers/producers of this century right now, and completely hitting this genre out of the ballpark & completely owning up to the docu-style horror industry, not just living up to modern viewer standards, but also getting a descent round of applause from some of the critics. It could've been a little more frightening but hey, for what it was, I was still on the edge of my seat throughout the last 45 minutes of the feature, while still laughing & cringing at times. I give this feature so much credit from someone who is more of a fan of true serious horror, than dark comedy thrillers but this one blew it out of the ballpark. Go get your friends/loved one, go to the theaters with an open mind, sit back, relax your thoughts, and just enjoy the roller coaster ride. You won't regret it! You will be laughing, cringing, jumping at times, asking yourself questions, and the most important of all you will be at the edge of your seat!!!

414,closerlookfilms,Shyamalan back in form? Hardly.,2,26 September 2015,"Warning Spoilers!The concept is simple. A teenage girl with a love of filmmaking and her white-rapper younger brother go to spend a week with their beloved grandparents. Within the span of about ten-minutes the kids and the viewer start to grasp on to the idea that grandma and grandpa aren't playing with a full deck, and whenever one grandparent is discovered to be doing something really 'weird,' the other explains it as a condition of the mind; always adding something to the effect of ""oh, you're disappointed in us"" or ""you're not having a very good time."" Those are sentiments that could easily describe my reaction to this movie, as once again I am disappointed in M. Night taking a fairly cool concept and wrecking it with an idiotic script, and no, I did not have a good time watching this at all.First question is why did Mr. Shayamalan make this a camcorder movie in the first place? He's just setting himself up for a movie awash in unbelievability, and I know I am not the only one who is sick to death of camcorder movies anyway. Putting that aside, he casts truly mediocre actors for the pivotal role of the grandparents and just OK actors for the kids. Third, why is the 13-year old boy portrayed as an obnoxious, mouthy white kid who thinks he can rap? I disliked that kid from the very first time he opened his mouth to rap, which basically had me caring less what happens to him in the film ... and a lot does happen to him and his sister, as the film goes for the gusto in the final segment. The problem is, the 'gusto' is a twist in the story that anyone could see coming, and even if I had not seen it coming, I could have cared less. The movie was over for me long before the trade-mark Shyamalan story shift.OK, so there's the concept and some concerns. But beyond all that, this is without question Shyamalan's worst film ever, and I am even placing it above ""The Happening"" in pure stupidity. It is not scary and the humor which is primarily the kids, especially the boy, saying profane things when they're scared, is just not effective. But the humor is not the only element that is not effective, neither are most of the horror elements in the story, which Shyamalan liberally steals from almost every Asian horror film ever created.Bottom line: M. Night Shyamalan takes another wonderful premise and destroys every chance of that premise becoming something special in the annals of horror films.",The Visit

I wouldn't particularly label this film as a horror, if anything I would say more thriller but nether the less was still an entertaining romp. I feel the reviews on here regarding the two grandchildren being ridiculous characters and and terrible actors is really unfair also, I think they both did a really good job with the scripts they were given.

416,odaat-30737,Not your cookies and milk Grandparents,9,22 September 2015,"Since the dawn of storytelling in cinema; while there have been masses of tales about wonderful loving parents, there has never been a shortage of depictions of creepy parents: such as films like, (1987) 'The Stepfather', (1994) 'Mother's Boys', (1960) 'Psycho', and even Disney's '1950' 'Cinderella'. In contrast; on the most part, grandparents seem to have a special place in the lives of both storytellers and their audience members. The common consistent characteristics of grandparents in cinema are the loving and or uplifting ones such as, (1981) 'On Golden Pond', (1987) 'The Princess Bride', (1985) 'Cocoon', and (2010) 'Little Fockers'. As a matter of a fact the concept of a grandparent is so beloved, that it is the subject of that old iconic Thanksgiving song, 'Over the River and Through the Wood'. This seems to be the ol traditional American portrayal of grandparents both on the small screen and the grand silver screen . . . . . . . . . that is until the recent release of M. Night Shyamalan's new film, 'The Visit' this month. Enter: Two adolescences in their early teens, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and sister, Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge); is sent by their single mother, Paula (Kathryn Hahn) onto a train to stay with their grandparents for a week; whom they have never met before. The only thing Tyler and Rebecca know about their grandparents is that they are their mother's parents whom Paula for some unknown reason has not spoken to them in 15 years. In the same joyful spirit of that Thanksgiving song, both kids travel equipped with their video cameras; in hopes of creating a documentary about their trip. Upon departing the train, the two are met by their grandparents, John (Peter McRobbie); whom the kids go on to address as the name 'Pa pa' and their grandmother, Doris (Deanna Dunagan) whom they address with the name of, 'Nana'. What begins as a typical cozy demeanor of grandparents in their house in a rural snowy area on their farm, slowly deescalates into the impression of uncertainty in the minds of the grandchildren. On their first day, Pop pop gently gives them two advisories: it's best to stay out of the basement, and also explains to them on the first night there: ""We're old people. We go to bed at 9:30"". In the case of Nana, sleep does not appear to be on her agenda: Upon Tyler and Rebecca hearing some noise downstairs a couple of hours past their grandparents' bedtime one night, the two leave their bedroom and spy Nana walking in the darkness naked clawing at the walls as she makes raspy guttural and hissing sounds. When they; out of concern tell Pop pop the next day what they witnessed, grandfather dismisses their concerns by telling them that it is just one of her symptoms of being old and suggest to them that they do not leave their bedroom after 9:30 PM. Pop pop would be considered to be the completely sane of the two grandparents; if it weren't for the periodical times of him suddenly freezing in position outside and staring towards the kids. There is also the fact that Grandpa tends to spend a lot of time in the shed for some unknown reason, which eventually results in Tyler and Rebecca going inside when Grandpa is not there to investigate with their video cameras. As the days go by, both grandparents' characteristics become more strange and eerie as they periodically act out in ways that cause both Tyler and Rebecca to wonder if their Grandparents are mentally stable. The plot takes you on a journey of mystery of twist and turns. I must admit that I almost left the theater at the very beginning of the movie. While I do love movies, I usually don't like mock-documentary style films. As the opening shot revealed a mother being interviewed on a video camera, I came close to leaving. However, I quickly started to notice that this was no ordinary mock-documentary film. While it was obvious that the movie was meant to give you the impression that you were watching a real home video presentation by someone, that illusion began to rapidly fade for me due to the camera angel shots. Most of the 'The Visit' is composed of beautifully crafted shots that could not possibly have been setup by teens in a matter of seconds. I think Shyamalan did a brilliant job in crafting a type of film I would not ordinary like into a type of movie that captured my attention the whole time! The movie reminded me much of one of Alfred Hitchcock's movies. The variety complexity of camera angels such as high and low contributed a lot to bringing an already suspenseful film to even broader magnitudes of greatness. I strongly disagree with the fact that the production company seems to have labeled 'The Visit' a horror/comedy film. While there indeed were some comical moments in the film, it by no stretch of the imagination felt like a comedy to me. The word 'horror' might be misleading to some people thinking they are going to see a slasher movie. The film does indeed qualify to have that word in its genre, but it's the Hitchcock creepy suspense style that transpires in most of the movie. Contrast to traditional horror films, this one strongly deals with characters' development where you get to know them: both good and bad sides of them. As a fan of M. Night Shyamalan, I've liked and disliked movies he's created. However; in my opinion, this is the best movie I think he has directed since, (1999) 'The Sixth Sense'. Like 'The Six Sense'; it is a movie I would love to see again because upon learning what is behind the mystery, you want to watch the film again to spot any clues that you might have missed the first time around.",The Visit

All the characters are more or less deranged and their actions make no sense at all.I won't linger on the myriad of plot holes and narrative threads left hanging, since other reviewers have said it all. The only comment I wish to add is about the creepy dissonance between the soundtrack and the actions depicted in the movie, for instance upbeat melodic opera playing in background during a bloody murder scene.I guess it's a ""homage"" to Hitchcock, even though I've never seen one of his movies from start to finish. Pure psychological horror with hinted gore and practically no CGI at all, in the MNS best tradition.The underlying message I seemed to grasp is that the truly scary entities on this planet are not monsters, aliens or supernatural creatures, but human beings themselves.I'd never watch this movie again but I can see how some people might like it for its weird quality.",The Visit

An issue that is real, and heartbreaking, This type of fail is just more reason for moderators to protect the audience from sick ideas being put on screen, too bad, I would have given this the highest review, but whoever was responsible for the ending, destroyed all of that work.

This was 90 mind-numbing minutes of two insipid kids talking/rapping into a camera with a few intermittent scenes of crazy grandparents. You pretty much see all the watchable parts in the trailer and it takes a good 30 minutes before anything interesting happens. It definitely had the potential to be a pretty cool movie if M. Night nixed the ""video camera"" motif and just made it a real horror movie. The actors who played the grandparents were very believable and could have been used so much more. The last 15 minutes of the movie, at least, added a little tension, but the lackluster ending just leaves you sitting in your seat with blank look on your face. The only horror was realizing I had paid to see this. The acting all around wasn't bad; it was just a pointless movie. It was an even bigger waste of time than The Village. M.

Either by somehow convincing movie studios and investors to continue to provide him with a budget, or suckers like me who continue to watch his films hoping to somehow recapture the magic that was the sixth sense.

Lets see, we have plants and grass killing off humans in a tree huggers version of the apocalypse, We have a magical world in the drain of a slumlords apartment complex, I don't even know what the last airbender was about, it sounds like stomach gas and stinks just as bad, and now we have this atrocity.

Really? I always thought that was impossible to put those two together...you know what? I was wrong! All what's happening to their grandparents is at the same time shocking and silly so here is the mix of comedy and horror, and then you have that ""brother moments"" that demystify all the suspense behind the movie and gives you good laughs! The whole movie is from the perspective of the two brothers who are trying to make a documentary about their trip to grandparents house and this allows you to get deeply into the movie and feel it almost in the first person. This is a different movie from all the horror and terror movies I have seen at the moment because even in those moments of breathtaking you can't stop laughing, not because what you're seeing is funny but because it's all nonsense and silly. Other aspect I liked about this movie is that you don't have any paranormal activity all just problems of humanity but this fact doesn't remove all the horror behind the movie. The only thing I didn't like was the rushed end, they could have explored more that great finale when all the things are explained because after this moment the hole suspense ends and it just becomes a normal ending...but disregarding this point I think the movie is perfect and you will certainly enjoy every minute of it.",The Visit
429,erykkortryk,This is NOT your traditional found footage horror film.,8,28 September 2016,"I went into this expecting straight up horror but what I got was a comedy/horror film. And I don't mean that in a bad way. This comedy is clearly intentional. To me it seemed as if M. Night was almost poking fun at the found footage genre. In a world where a lot of us younger people are a bit more desensitized it doesn't come off as quite a stretch when a kid says a joke after witnessing something terrifying. Which does happen in the movie a few times. I've seen some people complaining that the film tries to be scary but when a character makes a joke it undermines the effectiveness of the scene. Those people just don't get it. Despite what the trailers sold us on this is more comedy than it is horror. Don't get me wrong. This is also a horror film and it's effective at that as well. The third act is incredibly tense and honestly had me on the edge of my seat. If you want to go into this film and enjoy it I'd suggest you don't go in with any expectations. My only complaint about the film is that it's bland to look at, though I'm sure it's because of the film being found footage. At the end of the day I'm just happy to see M. Night make a good film again and I hope this continues.",The Visit

Half of it didn't make sense, the jokes weren't funny, the main girl is pretentious and annoying, the boy is also extremely irritating and his raps make my ears bleed. The only part that kept me walking out of the cinema was that twist in the middle. WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA????

431,njonesproductions,A film that dances in wonderful tension and provides a satisfying conclusion. (No spoilers),9,24 November 2015,"The Visit: 2015Firstly, my score reflects a personal enjoyment, and shouldn't be confused with a professional critique where I knit pick everything to establish some kind of snobbish superiority toward films.Now, personally, I'm an M. Night Shyamalan fan when it comes to his style of story telling. So whenever I walk into an M. Night Shyamalan flick, I always just tell myself to shelve the expectations... And enjoy the mind @#$% for what it is.""The Village"" would be a wonderful example of that.When I first started to watch this film, I almost wrote it off for a Fallout 4 session, especially when nothing seemed to happen for the first 30 minutes... but I'm really glad I didn't.The story revolves around two children who are meeting their grandparents for the first time. The mother, hasn't spoken to the grandparents in over 15 years, and refuses to confess why.Regardless of the mother's differences with her parents, the children insist on meeting them, but not without the idle protests of their protective mother... She of course ends up getting bought off with a Carnival Cruise by her boyfriend though, and ultimately allows the trip to happen being she still has love for her parents, and even concedes ""they are good people"" prior to letting the children go... So it doesn't exactly strike you as a set up for a horror film.The kids meet their grandparents and there is a bit of comedy that revolves around the generation gap, but everything seems pretty normal, at first...As the children continue their stay, they notice their grandparents are behaving rather strangely at times, the grandfather is distant often and the grandmother seems emotionally conflicted at times.Nothing unusual... Just old people with strong personalities right?Yes... Unusual behavior from gandma after 9pm, grandpa giving the creepy eyeball while he mutters to himself about diner dates, bloody rags in the shed... A mystery of some sort begins to reveal itself, but you're not quite sure what to think as it all presses forward.We only know that grandma and grandpa may have some issues of their own... Which heh, is pretty normal right? I know my own mom can get a little freaky with her own neurotic behavior at times, surely, but I never hold it against her... I just write it off as eccentric mom and let it go.And so do the kids in this film. They just shrug their shoulders and let it go.One off event, followed by another, and eventually the children start to truly suspect that their grandparents are fighting a few demons of their own indeed.As the visit continues, seemingly irregular behavior increases and the children start to become more concerned with the passing of every day. At first it was only concern for their new found grandpa and grandma... But by mid week, the children indeed begin to worry for their own safety.One event leads to another, until a shocking truth is revealed... And the tension up to the expected twist is quite satisfying. Without revealing anything, I can't say any more about the plot than I have.I will say it was a conclusion that was well worth the wait though.9 out of 10.Regarding any personal reflections on the film in its aftermath...As a parent, I was completely horrified by 15-20 minutes to close, but the true adventure was the mystery ""up to that point."" If you want a good thrill with an exceptionally well written script, this is certainly your film.Regarding the performances and style?I have to say that the children did a great job making me absolutely love their characters by the end. Grandma & grandpa were outstanding as well.Everything was beautifully thrown together in the style of amateur footage, but really, this is the kind of film that you can really get into because its ""all about the characters and the mystery, not the camera angles or video effects."" The camera angles won't matter for this one, the story on the other hand absolutely shines. Although... there ""is"" a very well cut scene under the house that even makes you wonder what kind of film this will become (Mainly being at that point, you don't know if this is going to go super natural or stay non- fiction.)People who enjoy good story telling will love this. Adrenalin junkies and Special FX consumers won't be as impressed.At the end of the day, it would seem that M. Night Shyamalan's gift for story telling doesn't really need a budget, just a great setting and wonderfully portrayed characters.Highly recommended.Nathaniel Jones, Music Designer Protilius Productions",The Visit
432,frankiacopelli,The return of the Shyamalan.,9,8 September 2015,"Back in 2014, when you heard Shyamalan, you either thought of movies like The Village, The Happening, The Last Airbender, or After Earth. So you could imagine me being a little skeptical about him coming back, and even with the edition of comedy. But, it was a genuine surprise to me, as this movie had me both peeing my pants in laughter and terror in all the right moments. The premise of the movie is that a mother drops her two kids off at their grandparents house, while the daughter decides to film it kind of documentary style. But, things aren't all that they seem at their house. The camera-work that Shyamalan did was absolutely great, and the performances are spot on, unlike the planks of wood that were Mark Wahlberg and Will Smith in previous movies by Shyamalan. The film that this guy put out with just one location, a handful of actors, and a really low budget, this movie is amazing, and it's good to see that Shyamalan is back and here to stay!

I was disappointed. It was a thriller. It did have some scares, and one time I actually jumped--a little. And I didn't figure ""it"" out until I was supposed to, which was satisfying--I hate figuring out a plot twist too early. But, it was not a supernatural-type horror movie.The movie started off very slowly. I actually found much of the first half quite funny, but I don't know if it was supposed to be. The kids' dialogue was not believable, the premise was not believable (what parent sends her two kids off on a train to grandparents she's been estranged from for years and her kids have never met???) and the kids' acceptance for the crazy actions of the ""grandparents"" was far from believable.

This was extra disappointing since my husband had worked on a number of his films. For a horror film, I thought The Visit was very good. There were moments when I was skeptical (yes, the found footage thing scared me a bit at first, so overdone and just not scary anymore) but I think it was not overused in this movie. It was part of it, but not all. There were a lot of opportunities to overdo things, and M Night stepped back and used subtlety instead. So much better, so much creepier. Creepy is good. Absolutely LOVED the performance by the actress that plays the old lady, that will be with me for awhile. Old man was pretty good also, one scene in particular will also stay with me for the rest of my life. Signs of a good horror flick.

438,readyplayerone-63241,Too many flawed elements,1,7 January 2018,"A lot of stupid things about this movie. (spoiler alert) 1) How does batter stick to plastic that the point where you couldn't scrape it off with your finger during the scene where the grandma intentionally used batter to cover up the lens so the kid's mom wouldn't be able to identify them. 2) Why is that every time when someone wants to talk to the grandparents, they are gone? For example when the kids used skype on their laptop in the kitchen, the grandparents are outside? Or when the counselor came over to check on up the grandparents because they didn't attend some charity event a few days ago, they were gone as well? 3) Why didn't the mother show a picture of the actual grandparents before sending the kids off? Why didn't the mother go along with them? Because she had to go on a cruise so she chanced her kids to strangers.4) Why didn't the kids question why there are no pictures of them in the refrigerator with the mother and how come all the pictures seem to be torn in half left on the refrigerator? 5) Why wasn't a red flag raised when the grandma intentionally avoids answering any questions when doing the documentary about the their mother? Because she couldn't since she doesn't know anything since she isn't the real grandmother.6) At the beginning of the movie, when the kids arrived at the house, grandpa told them not to go in the basement because there's a mold issue. Right then, had the kids asked ""why?"" they couldn't go down there because of mold, they would learn that their real grandparent corpses are hidden downstairs in the basement.

You can clearly see a blue cable coming out from the laptop.These cables are used to hook up a desktop/laptop to a router. Now if you do have a router you can just use your mobile over the router. The movie is very flat, from the trailers I was expecting more that's the reason I decided to go to the cinema to watch this movie. Some parts of the movie just made me laugh, I don't know if that was the intent of the director or if just happens.

When me and my friend paused the movie to go to the bathroom, neither of us could believe our eyes when we saw that we were only 31 minutes in.Besides being scary and funny, The Visit also has a nice drama element that actually makes you care about the characters which is something very rare in horror films.",The Visit

The truth is most of our family is allergic to cats so that wouldn't work.While the kids stayed with the grandparents things started getting weirder. The story moved slowly with the grandparents doing a lot of strange things. The cast was fair. The people who played the Grandparents were totally creepy, especially the Nana, played by Deanna Dunagan . She was a piece of work. I liked the Olivia DeJonge who played ""Becca"". Ed Oxenbould who played ""Tyler"" gave me a headache. He was obnoxious , especially with his attempts to be a ""Rapper"".The one thing I will say about this movie is that I am glad there was not a cat in it. One of my brothers and sisters would have ended up in the basement somewhere. Overall it was creepy and I really didn't like it that much. I think M.Night Shymalan should watch some of this older movies and get back on track",The Visit
455,nkareem-57300,terrible movie,2,28 September 2015,"The visit is a horror movie I wanted to see. Since the 2015 year horror recently had recently been very terrible. The sinister 2 was terrible and the remake of Poltergeist was terrible. So I thought I needed a movie that would give me reassurance of 2015. I thought this look decent and thought why not. Immediately I was already disengaged from the movie. The movie takes place where a brother and sister are visiting their grandparents. The mother sends them their and is divorced from her husband. The thing that immediately disengaged me was the boy rapping. It felt awkward and out of place for the movie.The acting was done excellency, they hard work was driving the movie onward. The movie tries to much with the flip flop with jokes and jump scares. It tries to clam or tone done the intensity of the jump scare with jokes. The mistake is that its turning the intensity with the dumb jokes even if its not intending to. The tone is very inconsistent with the tone, we couldn't get the tone whether its serious or funny.the camera angles were terribly. The director M. Night does a terrible job with the movie. . M. Night. prime is gone and pass, this proves he needs to retire. The ending is very terrible and stupid. This movie is a joke save your money.",The Visit
456,deebrubaker,Unfathomably Terrible,1,13 September 2015,"Walking into the over crowded theater to see yet another over hyped M. Night Shyamalan movie, I already missed the money I had spent on the 90 minute torture. Let's face it, Shymalan has not made a fantastic movie in over a decade and this movie does not show any signs of him getting any better. We all know as soon as we turn on a Shymalan movie that there is going to be a plot twist that is so obscure that we would never have thought of it, but the Visit fails to deliver this mind blowing twist. The idea that the 'grandparents' were mental patients who had escaped seemed pretty self explanatory from the start. Not only is the twist a complete failure but the movie delivers no real scare. There are a few cheap jump scares throughout, but no suspense or build up.The children in the movie are seldom frightened by the bizarre behavior of their 'grandparents', but they do make a lot of jokes about them and are very sarcastic about everything that happens. This strongly takes away from the horror factor. Think about it. You're stuck in a place with 2 elderly people you have never met who are very strange and at one point you even record one of them knocking on your door with a knife. Witty banter is the last thing on your mind. Finally the very last issue with this movie comes from one of the last scenes in which the 'grandfather' shoves dirty diaper in the young boys face and in retaliation, the boy kills the old man all the while yelling like the hype man at an 8 mile rap battle. No not like he's yelling because he's a minor killing someone who just shoved crap in his face, but literally like Eminem's on stage hype guy. As if that wasn't enough to defeat the end of this movie, after a touching scene with their mother, the movie cuts to the young boy in his sisters room rapping about his visit. If a kid had crap shoved in his mouth he wouldn't be writing a rap about it. If a kid had to kill someone to go home he wouldn't be rapping about it. He would be talking to a therapist and not acting as if nothing had ever happened.In conclusion, this movie was unrealistic, the emotions of the kids were very unnatural, the plot twist was barely a twist, and I would never see this movie again if I was paid to.",The Visit

458,LazloArcade,Suspense with a Very Disappointing Conclusion,4,24 January 2016,"**ALL SPOILERS** I had very low expectations going into The Visit but somehow managed to be deeply disappointed nonetheless. Of course it was eighty minutes of suspense and ten of the twist. I thought to myself in the freaking start ""Okay well there's no way the old folk are going to be escape mental patients; that would be insultingly platitudinous and in 2015, also pretty cheesy."" So anyways the twist was that, yup, escape mental patients. And you know how they reveal it? One of the first things the old folk say to the protagonists is 'Hey don't go into the basement'. So immediately you know something's down there. End of the film, girl goes down and finds none other than... jumpsuits embroidered with the name of a mental hospital! What is this?? 1980??? That story and storytelling does. not. work. today. It's freaking cheesy. It can't be escaped mental patients, it just freaking can't. You can't do that anymore today. It's freaking cliché. It's been done to death and now it's a punchline. Mediocre as he is, a seasoned suspense writer like Shymalan should have known better. And you know what? I was hoping he was taking it in the aliens direction. As dumb as that would have been, it would have been more satisfying. Like ""Oh so aliens took over your grandparents' bodies and they get sick and freak out like possessed dogs in a thunder storm when the sun goes down because, oh I don't know, maybe on their home there is no planetary rotation."" If I saw that I'd think Oh man that's freaking stupid, but at least it's something new. Okay and what twists my biscuits almost just as much was the pretty much only scare in the movie. It was a jump scare, which is fine since it was a 'found footage/hand-held' film. But precisely like the idea of escape mental patients, it was insultingly trite and cliché. Video camera set up in living room. Old woman crosses frame left. Pause. Old woman crosses frame right. Pause. Old woman pops up (literally springs up into view) right in front of the camera and goes ""Rawr!"" The literal exact thing you'd see in a you-tube scare video. Okay not only was that jump scare freaking stupid and predictable, but it was again, so cheesy, I questioned what year I was in. There wasn't one single moment in the entire film I ever felt remotely impressed with anything. At least in The Village, like, I liked the design of the 'monsters', liked the color pallet and even the twist was interesting enough. The grandparents' behavior is so totally bizarre and suspicious, I felt like Shymalan could have taken it in a variety of directions; even until the end, it didn't feel like everything could have ONLY been written off as violent mental instability. The old man's incontinence and that part the old woman crawls like a mole-man under the house- I felt both those could have alluded to them being not human. When the old woman told that story about the aliens in the like I thought/hoped it would turn out to be a body-snatchers thing. But no, he went with mental patients with whom we didn't even get to know the story of their escape, their relationship to one another, what they were doing, why they were doing it, who made the plans to invite the kids over (the real oldies or the impostors), why the kids were even there, what the impostors were even planning to do with the kids and why the community didn't recognize that the two beloved active counselors suddenly looked and acted totally different overnight. All of these unanswered questions could easily be written off by saying 'they were crazy people.' Which is a cop-out. They freaking advertised for The Visit like it was a demon, creature, ghost, alien thing. Curse you advertising! You got me again, you strategic hairpieces!! **SPOILER-FREE CONCLUSION** All in all it's a decent movie to put on while you're cooking or doing something. It's a decent movie if you're blazed and have already melded with the couch and lost the remote. It's not a decent movie if you're looking to be impressed or scared. Shymalan knows suspense well enough to keep you just barely interested enough to commit to seeing the end but provides no satisfying reward for the watch. The merit in seeing this film is not the story, characters or ending, the merit is, with all of Shymalan's films, the ride on the roller coaster of suspense. However The Visit would be the boardwalk coaster that doesn't have any loop-De-loops and only one big hill. I rate it a 4/10 because the cinematography was decent enough to the genre, the story pacing accurate, the budget wasn't cringe-worthy and the acting was tolerable. Everything else was bad.",The Visit

464,sueuprising3,Keep your parents locked up,5,12 September 2015,"Let me begin by saying, I am a big fan of M.Night Shyamalan. Films like the Village, Signs, Devil, Unbreakable were clever and mystifying entertainment. That being said, I can only say how disappointed I was in The Visit. First of all, it did not seem to carry the Shymalan signature other than the quaint Pennsylvania countryside. The indigenous stone houses with their 18th century interiors are always a joy to see, but no amount of hearth-side chit chat can make up for the sheer silliness of this film. The plot is simple. The two children of a single mother go to visit the grandparents they have never met . Familial falling out and dysfunction have kept them apart until they find each other on the internet and the the precocious offspring are off to PA via Amtrak. The son is a pre teen rapper who is just self conscious enough to make him annoying. The daughter is a young teen, actually very lovely, with little self image who video blogs everything while using big words to describe her situations. They arrive to find two very odd grandparents . I won't give the plot away although you probably can guess it without much retelling. Needless to say,things are not what they seem to be and there is some moments of audience jumping and screaming with a fair amount of eye covering. But it really is all in good fun which is one reason why I did not like the film. A rapping 13 year old white kid is not funny to me, although the audience in the theatre I attended found it immensely so. The girl , I forgave her forced superciliousness, because I am a sucker for aquiline profiles, but she could also get a little tedious with her excuses and her stuffy attitude. Nana and Poppy were horses of a different color so to speak and they did their best to ham up the weirdness. The Mom with her Hispanic boyfriend was a wooden character, whose purpose remained vague. She did a lot of big teeth grinning and acting class pausing, if you know what I mean. Anyhow, the tension does mount during the middle of the film and you think it is going in a good direction, but then ,after all, it falls flat on its face with sheer slapstick and bathos at the end. I am convinced that either M.Night Shymalan or another writer has been experiencing the care of their elderly grandparents and the horror of that prompted them to make this film. Certainly , I can relate .The Poppy with his dirty diapers, the Nana with her nighttime naked romps evokes that sense of disturbance and surrealism that comes when you observe the decline so evident in a person as they grow old. I am sure the film maker , having seen this first hand, felt the scenarios would make a good horror story. And so it would have,if it had left out the teenagers and their adolescent perspectives. The Visit is not a film you should pay to see. Watch it when it comes to Netflix or some other movie site. I am still anticipating another great movie from M.Night Shymalan, this just wasn't it.",The Visit

It's too immature for adults and the style would not appeal to children at all, and it's definitely not for teens.The characters and not well thought out and are not very likable, there is no connection between the audience and the characters.The plot and writing are terrible, the plot is unbelievable.

In general, I really appreciated the slow build...definitely could have done without the cheap jump scares, though. Even though both my husband and I called the twist before we were halfway in, watching it unfold was still extremely unsettling. I think the kids were especially talented, even if some of their actions were indeed annoying. I walked away from the theater feeling, well, oogy is what I call it. The movie just stuck with me.

The movie is a slow starter and this being an M. Night Shyamalan movie you hope and wait (and wait) for the twist to kick you and to return the goodies. When it does I couldn't help but feel disappointed. The acting is rather fair. Deanna Dunagan is actually quite good. There is a scene at the end that in spite of the reasonable effort put into it should have been left on the cutting room floor. You'll know it when you see it.It's been called a return to form for M. Night Shyamalan by some. But is isn't even on par with the Happening in my opinion. And I loved the 6thsense, Unbreakable, Signs and The Village.

471,ILovePigeonsALot,"Could have been an eagle, instead settled for a pigeon.",4,26 September 2015,"This movie could have soared the great blue skies, instead its scratching at the ground nipping for mouldy crumbs on the concrete floor. First off this movie is, or in the most part, a kind of ""found footage"" cum ""handheld"" style of movie where we see the movie from the third person perspective of the kids in first person (them behind the hand-cam). This kind of style of movie is very polarising. It can be executed very well (blair witch project, first paranormal activity etc) and be on Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones (really bad). This, sadly, falls in the latter. The pacing of the story is just... confusing. At some places it starts picking up and make you wet for more but then in most places it just slows down to such a snails pace you just want to click the X button and move on. People watch horror because they want to be drawn in so robustly into a storyline such that they can be scared or have their emotions whirled up like spaghetti on a fork. Think Insidious, think SAW. The storyline dragged you in so deep that you really got the scare you want from a horror film. And most of all the pace of the storyline kept you ENGAGED throughout the whole movie. This movie is 1 hr and 30 mins long... you can see where I'm going with this. Slow erratic pacing and 1hr and 30 mins do NOT go along without a disaster following. If you cannot pace a movie, its not going to be good pre 2 hrs. The main issue was the CORE climax/ plot twist of the movie... was actually quite good. When it was revealed i actually had a ""omg wtf"" moment... which really wasn't where you want the omg moment to occur 20 mins towards the end of the film when the other 1 hr 10mins were lacklustre at best. They could have spent the first half setting up the movie and then the second half setting up. rolling the plot twist which would have been great pacing, instead of 1 hr 10 mins plot set up and 20 min plot twist... The acting of the kids was as good as kid acting will get in these types of horror flicks, however they were never allowed to really ""shine"" in their horror acting due to the majority of the ""horror"" occurring, again, in the last 20 mins. And they could have REALLY pushed the boat on what the old granny could do... but they didn't. They just made her in a cliché which was really sad. You'll know what i mean when you see the movie. Long story short, it is literally ANOTHER M night shamalalala film. And i don't mean in the good way. Avoid in cinema, its worth a time waste on DVD, nothing more. After signs and the 6th sense hes been pumping the same slow pacing OMFG ADRENALINE MEGA PLOT TWIST LAST 10 MINUTES movies again and again. In conclusion this movie is like that roller coaster that you've been told is the fastest in the world and it lasts 5 mins. For the first 4 mins it literally goes slowly than a bicycle only to suddenly, for the last minute, speed up to the fastest speed just because it wants you to get off faster so that others can get on. Great! but you give me the speed i wanted for the past 4 minutes now?! when you're going to finish? That's like a birthday cake with only the candles... and not the cake... And i'm almost sure that his PR are single handedly writing good reviews to bump up the rating on IMDb... which is kinda sad. don't let them fool you. but there is some truth. he is back to his best... at being disappointingly mediocre.

This is one hell of a piece of shite movie, i'm not even gonna do it the honors and call it a movie. But first of all my rage comes from relative positive reviews of this thing. Most of them are like it's not bad, Shyamalan is back or something like that, and that it actually has humor in it. People said that this actually has humor in it. Mind blown. Now to get my point of view I think Shyamalan's best movie is The Happening. I don't care for him as a director, I don't care for his movies, and yes I think the money that goes to him should be given to a newcomer or some great European director to see what will they do in America.

Night. Sadly I couldn't have been further from the mark.The plot twist reveals a decent premise of a movie that could have been pretty interesting--two kids who have never met their grandparents find out that they've actually been staying with two escaped mental patients. That's an idea that could have lead to a lot of psychological tension had it been handled a bit better. And there were a few moments in the movie where I could see that idea trying to get out...the shotgun scene, oven cleaning scene, and grandma finding the camera could have been really great. Instead we get stuck with annoying and poorly written characters, horror tropes galore, and one more beat down on the dead horse that is found footage films. I also keep reading that the movie is actually supposed to be a horror/comedy. I didn't get that at all.

475,Libby628,Fun Ride,8,2 September 2015,"I went to see an advanced screening of The Visit after hearing good things from early reviews. I can honestly say, it's the most fun I've had in a movie theater in a long time.The movie begins with a simple premise. Mom (played wonderfully by Katheryn Hahn, who got to flex both her comedic and dramatic muscles in this role) is sending her two children off to meet their grandparents on their remote farm. The children have never met them because their mom had a falling out long ago with her parents. Both children are eager to go as it will allow their mother a much needed vacation and give them the opportunity to connect with these people after their father has left the family. The girl, Becca, is determined to find out why her grandparents and mother stopped talking and decides to shoot a documentary film of their week.Early into the film, it becomes apparent that this movie is not taking itself too seriously. Dialog along the lines of ""make sure to only film really important things"" is followed by the brother sticking out his tongue into the camera. The idea that we are about to see old people acting strangely and eventually....crazy, lends itself to humor and the film wisely plays on this fact. The scariest moments are often followed by shots of the characters reacting in the exact same way that we are, wondering what the hell did we just see. After a creepy ""hide and seek"" encounter with the grandmother, Becca looks at the camera with an expression that says ""that was weird...but I guess she's just old."" As the grandparents behavior escalates, we experience the same shock as the siblings, and have little trouble relating to their fears.And fears there are. Despite the humor throughout this movie, there are genuine scary moments. Most of these come during periods where we do not know what to expect. When the children hear sounds outside the door and open it or when they decide to put a camera in the living room overnight, you know the result is going to be something quite disturbing but you are not sure what. The ""twist"" near the end of the movie is not shocking but the way it was presented was very well done and effectively shifted the priorities of the characters and increased the stakes.I was pleasantly surprised by the performances of all four leads in this movie, most notably Ed Oxenbould playing Tyler. The character of Tyler really carries the humor throughout this movie and had the audience laughing from his first scenes to the end credits roll. Deanna Dunagan, playing the main villain of the two, was very creepy and really committed to this character. As the movie did not rely on special effects, supernatural horror or gore, the actors themselves had to carry the storyline and did well with this.The movie is less successful when it swayed from it's horror and comedy elements and attempted to look into how the children have dealt with being abandoned by their father. While I understand where M. Night was going here and it worked very well in ""Signs"", these scenes seem out of place in the context of the film and the second last scene, at the end of the documentary, suddenly feels like something out of lifetime movie.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to those looking for a horror thrill ride that will have you simultaneously laughing, screaming and covering your eyes. Our theater had lots of audience reactions and this is a testament to the directors ability to play with the audiences emotions and deliver something, while not highly original, enjoyable on multiple levels.",The Visit
476,nightelfranger,A solid piece,8,24 September 2015,"First thing that came to mind after the film was that it was solid. So it was pretty good, not amazing, but good. It had some classic horror elements to it while being a modern psychological horror film. The chosen filming style is difficult to do well, but in this case I think Shyamalan did a good job. When I evaluate the style I mostly ask myself if the scene is believable. Like for example if a zombie horde attacks your group, do you 1) focus on filming 2) put the camera down and focus on fighting for your life. Choosing the first option needs to lead to appropriate reaction by the rest of the group, if the film wants to remain believable. Like my reaction would probably be to smash the camera and the guy's face in.Overall I think it was well done and had all the right ingredients. It also did have some originality, but was missing that some special piece to make if perfect. Still best Shyamalan film since the Village.Also my wife was clinging to me and squeezing my arm in fear during half the movie, which made focusing slightly more difficult at times :P",The Visit

All along feeling responsible for her father leaving the family. The obnoxious and overly confident wanna-be- rapper younger brother who's actually a frightened wuss.

Following that, his next 3 films, Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village all seemed well for accomplished director until, The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth rolled around, bombing and turning M. Night's career upside down to the point where society didn't want another M. Night Shyamalan film see the light of day.Then a trailer for The Visit surfaced on TV screens and online. After seeing a preview I had to go see it, so me and a couple of friends went to the movies last weekend and , boy I was in for a thrill! The plot consists of a single mom who sends her two kids with their grandparents for the weekend. Simple right? Not until Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) notice that their grandparents Nana and Pop Pop (played brilliantly by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are a little strange...Props to the director for a different concept while actually being very enjoyable. On that note being a horror movie it has tension, no gore and it has a comedic tone, mostly delivered charismatically by Tyler being the comic relief. You may find yourself horrified in one scene and laughing in the next. Its very well paced, the actors did a great job, and oh just wait for the twist! 8/10",The Visit
482,jameswolf69-175-938414,Seriously? No respectable writer would be proud of this pathetic tripe.,1,25 September 2015,"This is my first review on here ever. I watched this movie not knowing it was an M. Blighthorridexcuseforawriteramalamalamadingdong farce. How does this hack even have a job. Anyone calling this pathetic excuse for a story original, lives at a place like the Maple Shades hospital in the movie. Even if it were original, WHO CARES. Like all the drivel this guy writes, it's empty and meaningless, like a bad joke with a punchline that no one really cares to hear, other than to put the joke to rest or because of morbid curiosity. SUCH GARBAGE!!! Is M, (forgettable last name) a soulless demon who found a body to inhabit for the purpose of foisting this hell upon the world and tormenting humans who DO have souls. THAT would make sense as to why everything he/it writes is just plain boring, pointless, meaninglessly shallow tripe with his sad 'signature' punchline at the end. Who taught this creature how to put pen to paper? An insane, soul-trading politician!?! Someone with their brain-stem detached, existing on life support!?! THAT also would at least explain the level of writing throughout this hacks career and his continual acts of cruelty towards the public every time he/it (not ruling out the demon theory) sits down to ""write"". GIVE UP and get a job you're more suited to, M. Blight Shamscam, like 'physically' torturing people for the war-mongers in Washington. That would be less of a travesty.",The Visit
483,emansmoviereviews,Disturbingly funny and interesting movie,7,2 September 2015,"The Good: The most surprising thing about this movie was how it uniquely found a way to be scary, but still include funny moments throughout the film. It knew when to be funny, and when to be scary, without mixing the two together. The scary parts will provide quite a few jump- scares, and in some scenes they will simply disturb you. The young boy, ""Tyler"" (played by Ed Oxenbould ), will quickly become a favorite in this film with his various remarks, ""swearing"", and ""skills"". I think it's fair to say that ""Nana"", played by Deanna Dunagan, does a really good job of playing the crazy grandma given all the versatile things she did in the movie. For some, the plot twist in the story will be mild, but good nevertheless.The Bad: As we've come to know from director M. Night Shyamalan (The 6th Sense, Signs), the ""big twist"" is to be expected. Because of that, if you're an over-analyzer of movies like me, you'll probably see the twist coming from a mile away. So in that aspect, the story is mildly predictable. (That doesn't ruin the movie though) Many of the scary scenes you'll see coming, and for the most part are not terrifying to the point that will give you nightmares. It's very generic horror and scare tactics that we've seen before.The Reason: Okay, so here's the real deal about this movie. M. Night Shyamalan is known for having a really bad reputation for putting out movies like Lady in the Water, The Village, The Happening, and others. He started off great with The 6th Sense and Signs, but since then, audiences have been generally disappointed. Luckily for The Visit, this movie was not one of his bad films. It was disturbingly funny and scary at the same time. This film is like his ""makeup movie"" to audiences. For example, in a relationship, if a guy messes up and constantly disappoints his girlfriend, he may give her flowers as an apology. Now the girlfriend may like the flowers, but that doesn't mean the boyfriend is completely forgiven. Shyamalan is in the same boat. The Visit is his ""flowers"" to audiences. We'll take it, but he's still got a lot more work to do to make up for all the other not-so-great movies he's given us.Take caution if you decide to see it. It's a unique movie. Not a Hollywood blockbuster by any means, but I wouldn't be surprised if many would enjoy it. To see this movie I recommend: Go in with low expectations, pay the matinée price, and go with a friend or date. (You'll want to talk about it afterwards)The Rating: 7/10For more of my reviews visit: www.EmansMovieReviews.com",The Visit

I know that last moment with a boy was directly stolen from joaquine phoenix character from ""Signs""... but we loved Signs. so why not this one. of course it's not perfect. twist seems a bit forced and it's not as good as his best. other than that, nothing much I guess? oh right that kid rapping sucks. hip-hop fans might not like it.",The Visit

I've been disappointed by his films lately. So the trailer was looking spooky enough I decided to give it a go. The movie was kinda slow, the kids joking around, I wouldn't joke around about my grandma holding a knife at my door. The twist ""THESE ARE NOT YOUR GRANDPARENTS"" kinda shook me, but from there on the movie went down hill, sadly. The jump scares were lame, the loony old folks were boring, and the found footage is so tiring! My face stayed numb for the whole last 20 minutes or so. The ending was pathetic, choice of score and all, the credits with the kid rapping about poopreally?! Is that your style Night? My husband fell asleep during. I actually woke him up o tell him he didn't miss anything, that I was SO disappointed, falling for another Night flop. Damn.",The Visit
486,nick_kay-76441,I could have made this movie!,5,10 October 2015,"In all honesty, this film is barry average. It is a run of the mill horror flick with some strange attempts at humour along the way. Like many pictures in this genre, it does build brief scenes of suspense with a well timed jump in your seat climax, but it is all a bit predictable.This is M. Night Shyamalan, not some college students given three days to create a horror film. If I was asked to make a scary film with no money, and only a few people to help, my check list of events on my storyboard would look like this:1. Hand held camera 2. A house in the middle of nowhere 3. A couple of weak vulnerable characters with very little back story 4. Strange people living in this house 5. The mobile phones don't work properly 6. Strange things start happening after a few days 7. Although these people are clearly crazy, the protagonist can't quite see it yet 8. Strange noises being when it gets dark 9. The lights don't work properly at night 10. Protagonist no1 goes to investigate in the dark 11. Use the torch on the hand held camera to scan the dark room 12. A scary face appears in the darkness......... You have just created 'The Visit''.... Well done. C- It's worth a watch for a few of the laughs, a few moments of obvious suspense and one or two really obscure moments (which include adult nappies)!! I really want M. Night to be great again, but I fear the worst....",The Visit

488,kwysocki,Coulda been.... But isn't....,1,12 June 2016,"I was really looking forward to this film for its seemingly original storyline and the subject matter.... Ugh.... Just..... Ugh..... There are many potential great moments in this film that are squandered almost in totality based on the gimmicky use of the ""found footage"" technique. I won't dwell on the unrealistic reactions or dialogue of the children to these creepy moments and events (think 80's horror idiots whom do not take every hint thrown their way to get out, get away while they can- without the charm or simplicity of those 80's camp films). Nearly everything is filmed with the first person camera angle where throughout most of the film it makes no sense at all. No- I would not film myself running, screaming while being chased.... No, I would not film myself creeping through a dark house at night, catching an eerie activity or two of my ""grandparents"", and then filming my own reaction to said activity.... Dumb. Forced. Predictable. Basically, this movie fails in just about every way in which it banks on succeeding.",The Visit
489,bbielski-58412,Comedy or Horror?,7,2 November 2015,"The Visit was intense. Not only did it permanently scar me for life, but it made me laugh too. The Visit was about a brother and sister who go to stay with their grandparents for a week, whom they never met. First mistake right there. As the week progresses, the siblings start to realize that their grandparents are a bit crazy, psychotic, lets not forget, creepy. The siblings were supposed to stay another night, but they realized that getting their mom to pick them up might be a better idea. So, when on Skype with the mom, she asks if the grandparents are there and being the kids they are, put their laptop up to the window to show that they were right outside. Now, me, thinking finally a scary movie with people who actually have brains, did not realize that a plot twist was actually going to show up, but it did. The kids were not staying with their actual grandparents, just two insane asylum escapees that decided to pretend to be their grandparents. No, I wasn't ready for that. I think that it was a good movie, but it wasn't as good as it was all hyped up to be, but I still see the grandmother crawling around in my sleep. Am I traumatized? maybe.",The Visit

I did not read any spoilers because hate spoilers, but when the twist ending comes out was just shout ""WHAT""??. Then it becomes more interesting.. Then it reminds me everything what happens in the whole movie. This movie makes me stupid and i laugh. There's a jump scare, there's a funny scene , and most of all, its original..

491,reidoslad,"Scary One Scene, Hilarious the Next (6.8/10)",7,1 October 2015,"So it is past midnight and I have just arrived home after watching The Visit. For some reason my friends and I decided to watch the latest session of the night, lovely. Anyway this movie is made my the man himself, M. Night Shyamalan, who has made some great films in his career, like The Sixth Sense, as well as the movies we would rather have removed from our memory, like Avatar: The Last Airbender.The movie starts off with our two main characters, played stunningly by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould, as they travel to their grandparents for the week even though they have never met them before and their mum hasn't spoken to them in fifteen years. This is where the movie, we aren't even five minutes into the movie by the way, confuses me a little because why would you send your children to a house with your parents whom you ended bad terms with and haven't spoken to them again, anyway without this dumb choice the movie could never have been created. As they go further into the week they realise that their grandparents are not normal, and that their grandma runs around the house after nine thirty like a crazy psycho.Ed I believe is the backbone to this film. One scene is scary as the grandma seems to be possessed as she runs around the house and attempts to break in to the children room, but then the next scene sees Ed making fun of it on video for her sister to record, this is what is great about this film, one scene you want to wet yourself and the next scene you are making fun of the previous scene, and Ed is the main reason for this. Another scene where this is relevant is when Olivia is trapped in a room with the possessed grandma and Ed is stuck in the kitchen with the possessed grandpa. One scene is the girl trying to leave the room as the psycho grandma runs underneath the bed and around the whole room, and the next scene you have the grandpa throwing his own fees at Ed, like this is the greatest transition in the entire film, excellent.*SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT* The great twist this movie shows is on the last day the mother realises that the kids have been staying with two psychos and not her actual parents, the psychos killed the grandparents and had them trapped inside the basement the entire time. This twist sent my heart right down to my stomach and I knew from that moment that the last twenty minutes of the film would be intense af. The ending isn't that great as they are able to escape to the cops out the front and their mum waiting for them, they couldn't have come two minutes earlier to help them out in there? And how aren't these kids traumatised after this experience, I mean two scenes later the kid is rapping and joking about the situation, which is entirely what the movie sets out to do, scare you a little bit and then make fun of you for being scared.Overall the movie was good with the scene organisation, the grandparents were played great and Ed was the real reason this movie succeeds, without him this movie would be worse then After Earth. Some aspects of the movie could have been done more cleanly, like blue duct tape was used on the cameras to cover up the canon logos, please put more effort in oh my god. This movie made me scream for a solid four seconds in which the whole theater proceeded to stare at me for a bit, but at the same time made me laugh more than some of the comedies that came out this year.That being said I give this movie a 6.8/10",The Visit
492,darthmaul-35535,Very funny and surprisingly great horror comedy.,8,12 September 2015,This movie had me worried m night shalyman has not done a great movie In 13 years. But this film excels at everything it scares you and then 10 minutes later brings a smile to your face one of the best examples of horror combined with comedy that I have ever seen. My favorite scene surprisingly was the hide and seek scene with the two children and grandmother under the house because it was both terrifying and funny. The actress who plays the grandmother I do not know who she is but she really needs to be in more films she was so awesome and was very scary she really sold me on being the freaky grandmother and had a creepy side to her as well. The movie was shot in a found footage type style that I know some people do not like but I didn't mind it at all I found it refreshing to see a film that was filmed like an in home documentary/ found footage format. But my favorite character in the film had to be the boy he was so funny witty his rapping you've got to see it and the teenage girl was okay to but seemed a little too much of a perfectionist she's very much like Dawson from Dawson's creek. Overall a great horror film and something m night shalyman needs to continue if he wants to be a successful filmmaker 8/10.,The Visit

I think so. It is clearly an insult to the dumbed down population of vanilla eating challenged, obese, blind and diminished viewers.

I have no idea who in Hollywood owes you but they blindly keep handing you money to make cinematic sewage. I just wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I can honestly say that I have never been so angry at the end of a ""movie"" as this one. Absolute cinematic garbage. Kids talking endlessly about nothing. Old people acting stupid and creepy for no reason that makes any sense. Not one redeeming or entertaining moment in the entire movie. Gross crap filled diapers? Thats entertainment? Man you are one sick and arrogant piece of work and then I take time to look at the behind the scenes footage of you and your minions arrogantly boasting about how fabulous your ""art"" is and how great this movie will be. Omg! People Run As If Hell Itself Is Chasing You!. Do Not watch this garbage. 80 percent is shot shaky cam style by children which is pathetic enough but there is absolutely nothing of any value whatsoever in the first 30 minutes and what happens next is absolute random stupidity without any sense of logic or entertainment value. The one and only jump scare is empty and fake. Pathetic! You have been bragged on way too long for the stuff you did two decades ago. I am now convinced that anything good that comes from you then or now is purely by random accident. It's time to hang it up and return to being a grip or some other minion job working for a real director. Look at the track record of Cameron or Spielberg or the amazing elegance of movies directed by Lasse Hallstrom. You are not fit to shine their shoes. You have ridden on the 6th Sense far too long and need to retire back into the obscurity where you belong. What you did with The Visit is criminal. I will never spend a penny on your garbage again and will warn others to avoid you at all cost. Retire dude. You are not a director.",The Visit
497,crimsonjis,Very Horrible!,3,21 January 2016,"The visit is a thriller movie based on two children (a brother and a sister) who are with their single mother who sends them to their grandparents house for a week so that they could meet them. The sister Becca (Olivia DeJonge) wants to make a really cool documentary about her grandparents and also about the broken relationship with her mother (or their daughter) and the little brother Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) tries to help her with it. As they stay there and film their documentary they find out that their is something wrong with their grandparents. Will they survive?To be honest this movie sounded really stupid and was also directed by M. Night Shyamalan so I thought this movie was going to suck. I WAS RIGHT. This movie has to resemble everything wrong with not only the horror genre, but with movies nowadays in general. So let's just see why this movie sucked so bad. First characters and character development. The characters in this movie have to be the worst characters that I've seen in my entire lifetime. Not only are they horribly written and are nowhere close to likable, but they don't develop as characters whatsoever. They were so static that they were like the TV screen in The Ring, and even when we started to learn more about them personally it either didn't really matter or we didn't really care which all together made them really boring to watch, and that's just the protagonist. The mom was also a horrible character just for the fact that she is SO stupid. She sends her kids off to her grandparents that she hasn't seen in years, and might still have two crazy people living with them. Second the plot which is a piece of absolute crap. I found it to be not only be stupid, but also extremely boring. All the way up to the end it was absolute boring and horrible because it had no suspense whatsoever. A Lot of the moments in the plot would have most likely been interesting if they built some sort of suspense (and if they did build suspense it was so horrible that I didn't noticed it), but they didn't. So combined with the found-footage type cinematography (which I will talk about later) and the lack of any score (which I will also talk about later) this plot had no interesting, suspenseful moments, which made it overall boring as hell. Third the Scoreoh wait I forgot THERE WAS BARELY ANY SCORE so let's talk about cinematography. The cinematography in this movie (just like any other found footage movie INCLUDING Unfriended) SUCKED ASS! The found-footage style of filming is just so awful and confusing to watch and it really makes it hard to make the movie come to life, or at least be mildly interesting. Sadly no one has pulled this type of filming off (and no one ever will) Overall I can only this movie 3 stars because it's that bad, but not 1 or 2 stars because at least they tried (barely).",The Visit

As for the positive, well done. A movie that was intended to be a horror, it was not over done by any means and I like that it could keep you tense with you always thinking there's just something else. Also, not using jump scares and keeping me a little on edge leading up to a great plot twist that I believe was somewhat chilling was a major plus for a thumbs up.

Why would she willingly walk into the back yard with two people she clearly finds suspicious? The mother is angry enough at her parents to not speak to them for 15 years, yet she's perfectly willing to send her children to them for a week.Just how long had Nana and Pop-pop been impersonating the real people? That was a really big pile of crap-filled diapers in the shed.The two people that came to the door made reference to big events happening at the mental hospital, presumably relating to escaped patients. Following these big events, no official inquiry is made when two obviously important volunteers don't show up as scheduled? An old man, unprovoked, physically attacks someone on the street and everyone just chalks it up to old-people paranoia? And the victim doesn't call the police?

Unbreakable is great and one of my all-time favorites and The Sixth Sense is very good as well. The rest have been ""ok"" to ""poor"".Forget all the logic holes in the movie...the kids having never seen a photo of the grandparents, the kids acting normal after all the weirdness going on, the fact that no one knows two lunatics have escaped from the local mental hospital and their two counselors have gone missing. Forget all that.The premise of the movie could have been interesting, but the way it was handled was just terrible. The word ""ham-fisted"" popped into my head over and over again as I watched this mess. There was no subtlety about the Nana and Pop-Pop characters at all. M.N.S went out of his way to show the audience, ""these people are friggin' crazy!"" There was no creepiness to it, only hilarity with how over- the-top the grandparents were made out to be. The ""twist"" was nothing of the sort as it was obvious as soon as the ""don't go into the basement"" line was uttered in the first 20 minutes. Sure there were some jump scares and a few funny moments, but horror film? Really?The acting wasn't too bad, but the script was God-awful.

I found myself liking the girl and wanted her to live - the boy was annoying. The story line I must admit had me tricked. It was believable... You know - young woman offers herself up to the wrong person - ends up saddled with 2 kids - her parents hate her for making bad decisions - under the stress of 2 kids and a dead beat baby daddy she decides it relieves some stress to hate them back... So you don't have any photos of them... Kids decide they want to meet grandma and grandpa because mom is poor and always stressed - go off to the country - see a cow - meet your long lost grandparents... Grandparents unfortunately were killed before the train got to the station - and these crazy people who meet them instead... Somehow the crazy people are together - boyfriend girlfriend? Not sure - they never explained how or at least my shallow mind did not absorb how... Whatever - they are together... Reason I gave this a 1 is because something is dreadfully wrong - and unlike in my Jason Borne review I cannot figure out what it is... Then again - it is not my job - nobody paid me millions to come up with this garbage - I was just unfortunate enough to have to pay $10 to witness it...

As far as I know the only movie I can remember watching from him is Unbreakable. So this will be a review that is based on the movie alone.The atmosphere is one of the most heavy I have ever experienced in a movie. I felt like I could grasp the tension as I was watching the movie. I don't know what made me feel so uneasy but it certainly didn't drag the movie down. Rather heightened it. I was on the edge of my seat attempting to figure out what would happen next.Good actors, but I can't help but feel that the kids didn't take note of the warning bells until close to the end. The brother's rapping felt out of place. But it might have been better if it had been presented beforehand. Feels like he just started rapping out of nowhere and you just had to deal with it. I'm not going to go into detail on the actor's performances apart from Deanna Dunagan who played the grandmother. She was very good and believable in my opinion. I think she stole the show.The conclusion to the story felt a little disappointing but that's probably because I knew it beforehand.

507,imdb-beamrider,Just too predictable (and kind of boring).,7,10 June 2019,"Overall, I liked this movie, but the twist (and you knew it had a twist because it's an M. Night Shyamalan movie) was overly foreshadowed and too predictable. Also, while I like a good build-up to the action, this movie takes way too long to get to where it needs to go.Not in the same league as the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, or Shattered -- not even as good as Glass, but still worth a watch -- just keep your expectations low.",The Visit

511,s_ho81,well another perspective of Shyamalan,8,22 October 2021,"""Would you mind getting inside the oven to clean it?""That may just be the greatest line from any horror movie ever.Now this could have been a great movie, had it switched from horror/suspense to thriller once the plot twist was revealed. I mean once it was out that, it's about psycho killers, then there really was no reason for more creeps and things popping out of darkness stuff. They could have brought in more dialogues between the characters, explored the killers more, made them more relatable. Confrontation scene at the end between the kids and the old people could have been much better.Nevertheless the whole idea of shooting it like a documentary was absolutely refreshing and brought a new edge to the story. Its insane how the sound effects are so well timed. To be honest what I felt was without the background score, a lot of good scenes just didn't leave as much impact as they should have, especially the plot twist.",The Visit
512,johnston-cole,The nail in the coffin for Shyamalan,3,17 October 2015,"More than any other director in history, I've given M. Night Shyamalan more chances to redeem himself. I want to like his films, I really do. I want to see him knock one out of the park like he did with The Sixth Sense. But after giving The Visit my full attention and coming into it with an open mind, I think it's time to call it quits on Shyamalan. There were moments in The Visit that were teetering on creepy, there were moments that were teetering on funny, but to call this film a horror comedy would be giving it far too much credit in either of those genres. Making the young leads so precocious and irritating (the 13 year old boy raps 3 times in the film) does no favours to an already weak narrative. Nor does the needless found-footage style of filmmaking, which seems forced and extremely poorly executed. In terms of storytelling, there were countless continuity errors, scenes that had no relevance, jump scares to make up for genuine horror, and two of the least likable leads in Shyamalan's entire filmography. All in all, I'd avoid this one at all costs. Just watch one of the two decent films he's made instead.",The Visit
513,v-seldon,"Solid entertainer that balances scares, laughs, and drama unlike anything else in recent memory",8,18 September 2015,"Really interesting blend of a few different genres and a few different styles of camera work. The audio work is noteworthy as well - you'd never guess it was made on a micro budget of $5MM thanks to the terrific sound effects. A thinking-man's (or woman's) horror film, this opens up a whole new chapter in the genre.I'm among the many who were perplexed by perplexingly bad movies that M Night made - particularly The Lady in the Water - but I'm glad some of his instincts are still intact!The movie is ever-so-slightly off-center that it's charming.

The plot and story line is great, everything that happens is quite realistic which I love. The plot twist itself was a great touch, I did not see it coming sadly. Even if this isn't your kind of style, the movie itself is OK at worst. For anyone to give this less than 5 out of 10, is mind-boggling.",The Visit
515,Dezzi,I found it enjoyable,6,3 November 2015,"While it may not be the best movie that has ever been filmed, The Visit was quite enjoyable. I am usually not a fan of found footage movies, but I thought this one was actually watchable.I have seen many criticizing comments for this movie. And some make good points. However, personally, I found The Visit quite suspenseful while watching and looking for clues as to what is actually going on. Many movies nowadays tend to bore me with their unoriginal plots. This one was original at least and I think it deserves credit for it. Also I found the acting very good. Child actors are imho a dangerous element in movies, because they have a hard time acting realistically. These two however surprised me. They did a very good job. As did the other actors (especially Deanna Dunagan). The acting also deserves credit.(excuse any errors, I am not a native speaker)",The Visit
516,leydelminimo,again with the children,4,24 June 2019,"One more time, Shyamalan, creates child characters with the complexity, dialogue and wisdom of a 75 years old. This time, unfortunately, what happens around the children is not good enough to compensate.",The Visit
517,bmanlikesmovies2,An Intentional yet Imperfect Horror/Comedy,7,24 October 2015,"Just as Scream was an ode and a self aware spoof to slasher films, The Visit is spoof/ode to found footage films. M. Night said that he filmed the film in two versions (comedy and horror) and then he combined them to make a horror comedy that comes out to be a fresh air of bizarre yet entertaining filmmaking that I have honestly not seen in a horror film in a very long time. This time its on purpose unlike The Happening, which was not a comedy by the way, it was ode to drive in horror Z-Movies like The Blob. Back to The Visit though, the two main characters represent the mindset of someone who would want to make a found footage film. They also represent the two sides of M. Night himself. Their is the ""celebrity"" who jokes around tries to constantly get attention and thinks of himself as ""THE NEXT BIG THING"" and is also trying to uncover secrets about his subjects while throwing his moral compass out the window. This represent the ""reality show / cash grab"" side of found footage. And then theirs the pretentious artist who thinks way too highly of herself and refuses to do things that go against the honor of filmmaking. It all comes together as bizarrely entertaining mix of pure art and shock value. There are genuine moments of drama and horror towards the last act that are so intensely scary that I was shocked that I could still become this scared in a horror film again. True horror comes from the situation of the event, not just jump scares. Which brings in my gripes. This film is anything but perfect. Even though there are moments of true horror, the shock value side undermines the drama a lot. Their are way too many jump-scares, a lot of bad horror movie clichés, and inappropriate humor in places where there doesn't need to be humor. I liked the characters a lot, but there were moments in the film where kids antics (especially the rapping) became very out of place especially within the context of what was going or what just happened in the film. Other than that, this movie is a descent baby-step forward from M. Night. This is definitely better than The Last Airbender, The Happening, and After Earth. Lets be honest though... You can only go up after those movies.",The Visit
518,jldmorris,Beware of Fake Reviews,4,4 October 2015,"This movie was rated way too high and I felt compelled to give an honest review of the film.The kids were very annoying. They would regularly yell ""Poppo"" or whatever. Their dialogue was way too pretentious and mature for their age.The whole found footage thing was not necessary. Most of the shots were composed professionally.I didn't understand the comedic aspect of the film at all. The kid was a misogynist rapper and the girl was supposed to be a nerd. There was also a couple bare butts from the Grandma. Only 20% of the movie was horror. It delivered only a few good scares. I kept waiting for it to pick up and be spooky. I had hope during the under the deck chase scene. But was totally let down throughout the rest of the movie. The idea of horror was old people acting bizarre. It was random and not creative.Much of the movie was too dark. Especially the ending scene, where the found footage made us miss most of the action. Overall, a strange, confusing movie. It's worth a watch, but be prepared to be disappointed. I was really looking forward to it based on the trailers. But it ended up being a let down.",The Visit

521,leospakka,Say whatever you want about M. Night Shyamalan... but THE VISIT is a great horror film!,8,8 May 2016,"OK, probably not the best picture of M. Night Shyamalan but it is a great film. People has to consider that they are watching a Horror film despite who is directing it.The visit contains all the elements essentials in a low budget horror film: two scary characters also mysterious & unpredictable, a house in the middle of nowhere, spooky moments, blood, suspense, a grotesque humour Raimi's like and a nice twist.The movie introduces a new concept of fear, imagine how many kids would be traumatised after watching it. Imagine how many kids will refuse to go to their grandparents during the week end. I find the formula of this picture simple, genius and highly effective. The behaviour of these two old characters is never too extreme or paranormal,the fact that they were extremely realistic and never banal or over the top allows the audience (or simply me) to find spooky even just a smile from Nana.I like how throughout the movie you get to learn more about the main characters and start liking them (kind of, those two kids and their mom are at pretty annoying and not appealing at all). All that drama about the past of Tyler & Becca and their relationship with their father is well constructed, it helps unfold the characters, but it is just not interesting... It would have been nicer to find out more about the past of Nana and Pop Pop. It is a great Horror, that like every other horrors should be watched alone at night to fully enjoyed. Some scenes scared the s**** out of me, and that was a great joy.",The Visit

524,jankozlatic,A step in the right direction,8,27 September 2015,"Let me start off by saying that i loved some of Mr. Shyamalan's early work, like The sixth sense and Unbreakable, hell i even enjoyed Signs. But then came his downfall, one miss after another, and prior to this movie i had no hope for him.The only reason i went to see this is because there really weren't any other movies to watch at the time. I walked in with zero expectations, and i must say i walked out quite pleasantly surprised.The plot is simple, but told very effectively. The ""found footage"" style of storytelling rarely ""works"" for a movie, but here it really helps you get more immersed. The camera is fairly steady, and shaky only when it really needs to be. The actors did a great job, especially the kids. Too often these days children in movies can be summed up by one word - annoying. Not this brother and sister. They connect with the audience, you laugh when they laugh and you are scared when they are. The grandparents are also good, really giving off that spooky, unsettling vibe. I must admit i was a bit skeptical when i saw that this is in fact a mix of horror and comedy. But Mr. Shyamalan pulls it off brilliantly. The movie will have you laughing while feeling chill crawling up your spine. Quite a unique feeling.The actor who portrays the brother is clearly very gifted for comedy, considering that most of the laughs come from him.Despite of this being a ""simple"" movie (although it tries dealing with more serious issues, but without consistency), i would highly recommend it. It feels very fresh, and i wont say Mr. Shyamalan is back on track, but i have to admit that this is a solid step in the right direction.",The Visit

Thankfully, however, he has never seen his Nana's backside. I fully expected to be bored and to be counting the minutes until it was over (like most movies my son drags me to) but that was not the case this time. I was either laughing out loud or jumping out of my skin throughout the entire movie. The bad raps by the ""ethnically confused"" 13 year old kid had my son and I rolling. We liked the plot twist and we especially liked the way the grandfather helped the boy overcome his germaphobia! I am not sure this will go down in history as a critically acclaimed great American movie classic or that it will win any major awards but I have to say I enjoyed it thoroughly.

Unfortunately it was one of those cases where the guy who edited the trailer should have made the movie as the bar had been set much higher than the finished product came near to delivering.Firstly this movie is (yet another) ""found footage"" film, a sub-genre which has arguably overstayed its welcome and I started getting itchy feet within the first few opening scenes. Secondly (based on the trailer)I thought I was in for a supernatural thriller but it's not. That's not to say it's without its moments of suspense and laughs on our trip to Grandma's house but sometimes these laughs feel almost unintentional. Speaking of unintentional, The dialogue of the two young protagonists is clearly the words of a 45 year old man trying to write for what he remembers young teenagers speaking like 20 years ago (and the camera-work for young teenagers with cheap hand-held cameras is almost Hollywood-like cinematography).Overall a film that's oddly less than the sum of its parts and a clear missed opportunity.

And how he did so with the virtuosity of a master. With subtlety and subliminal images of the best horror films ever created like The Shining and Suspiria. He even paid homage to Asian horror flicks with the claustrophobic hide and seek scene and the surprisingly predictable but necessary twist revealed at the last 15 minutes of the film. Even the most recent movies such as The Taking of Deborah Logan and Oculus are not spared. The only things that are not so subtle here are the ""found footage"" premise, the Hansel and Gretel/Little Red Riding Hood references and his parody of James Wan's horror hits.What made this movie a success is how it was treated. How he managed to build and layer the story with humor and dread is a testament of how great a story-teller the director is.

The movie itself is quite simple and passes quickly. You won't remember it six months from now, but till then, whether you hated it or loved it, you will recall that it was fun.Finally, many people are saying that it is a found footage film, but there is some inconsistency in this which might be either intentional or not. The shots telling us what day it is every morning are not explained, and (I am not sure, but) some of the shots when the kids are speaking with their mom are seemingly from the third camera. My point being, that may be the movie does not need to be rated low simply because it is a 'found footage' themed fare. There is a twist of course, but I saw it coming. It is not that I am smart, but I think M Night did not want to have a hairpin turn like his recent movies which backfired, so he decided to go with a half-way-there twist.I suggest watching when it is on DVD.",The Visit

As far as a comedy horror flick the funniest part is the 12 year old white kid rapping like he's straight outta Maine. The daughter wants to create a film about ""the Visit "" which she might as well got directing credits. I don't think M Night actually showed up to work on this disaster we will call a movie but at least it only cost 5 million dollars so which leads the viewer to ask what happened to the other 4.9 million dollars.

The way it was filmed was great, any other way wouldn't be the same. I thought the director of this movie was great before and my opinion def didn't change after seeing this one. The acting was good.

Saying that, this is his second-worst film. Now, considering that of all his films, I only hated The Happening, that doesn't discount this film entirely. In honesty, I loved all his other films. What this film was missing for me was the depth of character I've come to expect from M. Night's films. I didn't feel like I ""knew"" the two main characters-- the kids. Yes, their insecurities and finer bits of their personalities were touched on, but not truly fleshed out. The twist at the end did shock me. I feel that to fully appreciate the nuances and foreshadowing that Shyamalan does so well in his work that I'll have to watch the movie again. Like I said, it's his second worst movie, but he's only actually made one bad movie in my opinion, so it's not bad, it's just not WOW like his others have been for me.

Plus, this movie is not scary as it is creepy and disturbing. There are like 1 or 2 jumpscares in this movie,just to prepare you. Anyways, In my opinion, the movie could have been better and longer mostly due to the fact that this is, after all, an M. Night Shamylan movie, you would mostky expect the big twist to ocure pretty early and believe me it kind of does. But it didn't affect the way I felt about the film at all, it actually shocked me.

541,haveyoueverheardof,The Visit - to the Dreadful Pit of Mediocrity,4,17 January 2016,"So, I just watched M. Night Shyamalan's latest flick, ""The Visit."" If you haven't seen it yet, SPOILER ALERT!! Continue reading at your own risk.Firstly, I'm quite disappointed in Shyamalan and I really think he's losing it. He hasn't made a movie in like 5 years, and this is what he comes up with? Oh yeah, he did have a part in last year's ""After Earth,"" which is a children's movie, so it doesn't count.I've loved pretty much all of his movies, except of course for the notorious Airbender, which honestly I never even bothered with. Needless to say, I was very pleased that he was finally making something back in his genre and was quite looking forward to it! I'm not a big fan of the found footage style, though there have been a few cool ones. The movie starts out okay – a little slow paced, with a creepy kind of undertone, similar to many of M. Night's previous works. I waited patiently to be fascinated by some amazing plot twist, or at the very least, mildly frightened by a few good scare scenes.However, the creepiest scene in the entire movie was about 90% of the way through, when the Mom says, ""Those aren't your grandparents."" So that was pretty cool and I really was not prepared for that. I was thinking ""yes, here is where it escalates."" But, noOoooo. That's the entire punch-line. Grandparents were murdered and replaced by random crazy old people.That's all. That's the whole story.Not aliens that live under the water and lure unsuspecting victims into a deep sleep, only to devour them later. Not monsters that morph at sundown and feed on young children – which is actually what I was expecting – something more ""Coraline"" style. Besides, there's absolutely no reason to repeatedly ask someone to get in the oven if you're not going to eat them!!! So, since pretty much nothing is explained except for the fact that the grandparents were murdered and their 'replacement grandparents' just wanted a week with the kids, we'll have to conclude that everything mentioned earlier in the movie in regards to the fake grandparents' condition is what the true plot was meant to be.For one, I think it's a little bit mean to say that those who suffer from Dementia, Schizophrenia or Sundown Syndrome are likely to spend their evening hours running around on all fours. Next, all the previously creepy scenes like fake grandma's incessant laughing before trying to strangle herself, fake grandpa's story about the white creature with yellow eyes, or fake grandpa trying to shoot himself, are now merely the product of none other than actual mental illness. While those may not be considered 'plot holes,' they are to me. I don't know how they really thought they could get away with explaining the entire movie away with: they're crazy. Just pure laziness, really. Someone came up with a kind of interesting plot, then just got bored and stopped before the punch-line.All that to say, next time I'll think twice before blindly watching a Shyamalan film without bothering to read reviews. Actually, that's not true at all. When the next horror/thriller flick comes out with M. Night's name on it, I know I'll still do exactly the same thing: Excitedly go out of my way to watch it, despite what anyone says. Sigh old habits die hard.But seriously, unless you also suffer from the hopes that M. Night will one day make another beyond awesome movie, and will therefore watch all of his movies while waiting for one to blow your mind. Just ... don't even bother with ""The Visit.""",The Visit
542,town_night,One of the best times I had at the movies last year.,9,20 January 2016,"The Visit, is easily M. Nights best movie in years.This is a movie where you are creeped out at one moment and then laughing the next, and for the right reasons. This is not a so bad its good type movie, its a genuine good/great movie. The found footage aspect in this movie also works well. I can believe why this is being filmed.The child actors in this do a great job, as well as the grandparents. Probably some of the best acting in a M Night film.This movie is a major step in the right direction for M.

543,gvalluri,The Night we knew and loved is finally back.,10,10 September 2015,"Well that took a while but I can now say that he is back. I think this is the kind of film where he thrives– low budget, small and intimate domestic settings and a smaller scope. It has echoes of Signs, The Village and The Sixth Sense. I see that critics are comparing it to The Conjuring and I would agree to an extent yes, it has the same level of information withholding.It's amazing how this film manages to be so wonderfully terrifying without the use of much cgi or special effects. A couple of points in the film I yelped and let out a nervous laughter (and I'm a tough guy).M. Night Bashers will continue bashing this film but I feel this will stand the test of time, much like his best films. I hope he keeps this up and makes two or three more of these 'small' films quickly and then perhaps, people will eventually forget his larger failures.I say, watch it.

552,mcrist-59432,More Comedy Than Horror,3,18 November 2020,"M. Night Shyamalan's 2015 The Visit, which follows the misadventures of siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge), who conveniently appears to be invested in making some sort of documentary, giving the film the perfect excuse to slip in a bit of the ever-popular found-footage style, and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), an almost impressively annoying aspiring rapper, on a trip turned nightmare to their grandparent's house.
The movie, quite frankly, is funnier than it is scary. Between Tyler's horrific free-styling that's so cringe inducing that a dead body or two showing up on screen is a welcome distraction, and the over-the-top shenanigans of Nana and Pop Pop (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) that are more absurd than scary, it's hard to tell whether or not the movie takes itself seriously, and whether the humor is entirely intentional- which is where the problem arises. Shyamalan clearly tried to bring in some element of comedy to temporarily ease the tension, likely after past criticisms of his films becoming nearly pretentious in their seriousness, and while he should be commended for breaking away from his usual formula, he failed to strike a balance between the comic relief and genuine suspense of the film. Given that the movie is overflowed with horrific one-liners from Tyler and zany family moments between the children and their mother (Kathryn Hahn) who never quite grew out of her rebellious teenager phase, anything that came in between that was intended to frighten the audience instead came off as more of a slightly morbid comedy skit. The scene where Pop pop smears one of his used adult diapers in Tyler's face might've been genuinely disturbing, but given the surrounding context, it inspires more shocked laughter than gasps of horror (it's also quite hard to feel sorry for Tyler, given that his only characterization seems to be centered around making him as annoying as humanly possible). Nana launching herself at Becca's rolling camera in the middle of the night seems more like an overzealous parody of the Ring, and her request for Becda to get in the oven, reminiscent of the Hansel & Gretel folktale, feels like such a cliché piece of dialogue that it can't possibly be part of a serious script.
Beyond the less intentional humor of the film, the characters themselves aren't exactly well-crafted, and it becomes quite difficult to root for them as protagonists. Becca is extremely one-dimensional with her supposed documentary acting as her central character trait. Tyler is a living, breathing cliché of what I imagine most adults think a young teenage boy is- criminally obnoxious and mildly sexist, with the extra 'dimension' of him being violently germophobic added to set him apart. The mother is absurdly immature, as she's apparently held a grudge against her parents since before her children were born for a fight she caused after she hit her mother, but is suddenly ready to reconnect just long enough to dump her kids off with them so she can go party on a cruise with her new boyfriend. All of these characters are nearly impossible to sympathize with, (it truly becomes a matter of whether or not you hate the kids or the mother more- in the later case, one might pity the children for having to put up with her). All of them are forced into unearned character arcs that attempt to strong-arm a thinly-veiled 'lesson' in at the end to give the movie some depth.
Some have made the case that, with the right actors, this film could've struck the particular chord Shyamalan seemed to be aiming for. I would argue that it's just the opposite: the cast did the best with what they were given, but no amount of talent could've ever gotten this script off the ground. The written dialogue was often forced and cringe-worthy, especially for the kids; the child-actors in this film are actually quite talented, but their lines feel as though they've been written by someone who's never spoken to a teenager before and only understands them in the abstract. Overall, the film fails to be horrifying in any other aspect beyond the quality of its writing, and the suspenseful scenes are overshadowed by the overzealous acting and unintentional humor, causing them to fall completely flat. It certainly breaks the mold of Shyamalan's other films, but perhaps not for the better.
In the end, it's a good laugh, and I'd recommend it for anyone looking for someone looking to entertain rather than frighten themselves.",The Visit

It is actually surprising to me that this movie didn't receive Razzie nom for worst Picture but I've go into that more in detail.The characters are unlikeable. The kids are irritating and annoying from start to finish with dialogue that will constantly remind you that an adult wrote them. Obviously, it's the case but where is that sense of illusion? Besides being cheesy, the dialogue and banter between Becca and her brother seems forced and unnatural. Becca in the film is into the whole mis en scene when it comes to her ""documentary,"" and don't worry because it will constantly be thrown in your face that this is what defines her. The found footage style had a reason but again, it's one of those scenarios where characters are gonna keep recording despite the situation. It kept taking me out of it, this and the cheesy jump scares and the cringy dialogue that went with it. (Trying not to spoil anything) Honestly, look elsewhere if you want to see a good movie.

Over the course of the week, things get more and more unsettling and it becomes pretty apparent that this visit probably wasn't the best idea, but their mom, who had become estranged from her parents many years before, wants the kids to get to know their grandparents, and they certainly discover some interesting facts about grandma and grandpa. The actress who plays grandma does a great job of alternating between a kindly old lady and someone who seems to be becoming completely unhinged.

It was only due to my recent binge watch of Wayward Pines that I decided to take a chance on this movie, and I'm so glad I did!Much like my experience with Wayward Pines, I was utterly captivated by The Visit. It was way better than I expected, and I think the best part was just how elegantly simple it was. It starts out scary enough... old people doing weird, old people things. It begins as just an uncomfortable and awkward situation all around. But then the film takes a deeply disturbing turn that not everyone may expect, though I'm sure the idea will cross your mind at some point half way through the film, as it did mine.I haven't had this much fun with a Shyamalan production EVER, and this is definitely one of the most satisfying horror films I've seen in a long time.

Besides that, he even start kicking that old man shortly after that. 3. When they open the door a woman is hanged in there, there is no reaction from them to this. 4. They kill two people, but they act so normal after that, the kid is rapping and stuff like nothing happened. Come on, a grown up man would be f***ed up after this, but these are two kids. 5. In the kitchen, that old man is far from the kid, he doesn't try anything, to run or something... OK, let's say he is terrified and that's why. 6.

Because after a long wait Shyamalan has finally delivered. The visit is scary and funny like when someones jumps in on you for a scare and you start laughing after they have scared the the bejesus out of you. I have never been a big fan of the amateur handy-cam movie making genre but this one is different because it does not have unrealistic CGI or strange shadows, instead the scare is more real and the credit goes to the actors. The plot may seem basic because of the simplicity in style the movie is shot, but as you get closer to the climax you start connecting dots and see the complexity, not in the plot but in the story telling for which Shyamalan is greatly known. The star of the movie is this young talent Ed Oxenbould, an Australian actor who did a great job at handling American accent on top of it Rapping through the movie. Ed was funny and mature as an actor which a lot of older actors fail to do sometimes and what Shyamalam has always had an eye for in young actors like Haley Joel or Abigail Breslin. So kudos!

The first time the boy raps into the camera it is really bad, horribly acted and it takes way to long. Not to mention that this happens twice more. I will go into my idea of why this occurs at the end.2. The movie is never scary, just disgusting. Which is easy seeing that he just films naked, sometimes pooping, elderly people.3. The twist is not really a twist, because it is the only explanation possible, a half hour before the so called twist.4. I think as do many others, that the analogy of the sh*t being shoved in the kids face is actually a f*&% you from M.Night to the viewer.5. This is possibly the worst. If you make a hand-held movie the worst thing you can possibly do is only accept danger when the camera is facing it. If you are being chased by something scary just turning away the camera does not make the danger go away. Too bad M.Shight seems to think so.And last but not least the end credits, where the kid feels the need to rap again. This is just the director adding insult to injury and smearing the fecal matter that he previously threw in our faces.I will not be watching an M.Night movie any time soon again.",The Visit
573,dolphal,M.Night's worst film yet!,1,20 September 2015,"So, I went to see this with a lot of anticipation, I was hoping that this was the return of M.Night after a few of his previous films fell flat on their face. But, for me, it was not meant to be. I have a few problems with this film but it is down to the writing and down to the directing. When the main kid actor uses the word ""swerve"", that's strike one, when he starts rapping, that's strike 2 and finally, strike 3 comes when they have 2 different cameras that are both being used with the intention of making it seem like they are making a documentary but instead the footage is the same quality from both points of view, very clean and very crisp. That is such a stupid idea from M.Night's crew, a found footage style film is supposed to be gritty and is not supposed to be perfectly filmed, it's supposed to put you in the moment, make it seem like you are there filming them, not sitting in a cinema watching it, it's not a fantastical genre, it's a genre that's main intention is to scare you. I wasn't scared, at all.I really do not understand how this film has got a score of 7/10. People seem to enjoy this film and I have no clue as to why. If this was a small name director or a cast that has ever been heard of before then I would give it a little more credit, but not much, certainly not enough to where I would actually watch it again. But, for a huge name like M.Night to come back and try to take the film game by storm with this pile of garbage, he has sadly shot himself in the foot. I feel his career should be done now, but with everyone else liking this pile of crap, it seems he will be back, just don't expect me to buy a ticket.",The Visit
574,reiderander,Great combination of horror and comedy,8,1 December 2015,"It is not so common that the genre of horror and comedy are mixed in a movie without it being a cheesy spoof film. M. Night Shyamalan blends these two together in a way that has not been done before. He also uses a technique done by many other recent horror films by using a ""self-filmed"" perspective, but does it well enough that it does not blend in with the other movies in its category. This mixed with normal shots create a great balance and does not overwhelm the audience or make them nauseous from too much camera shaking. The film tells a story about two kids who are going to visit their mother's parents for the first time in their lives. Their mother left home early as a teenager and lost contact with her parents for many years. The daughter, Becca, is an aspiring film maker and wants to capture the experience in a documentary about meeting her mother's parents and finding out why they do not speak anymore. Her camera is used in many shots to show her own perspective on what happens. The son, Tyler, is the main source of comedy in the film. He is often working on his freestyle raps and trying to cut back on his cursing by replacing bad words with names female pop stars like ""Katy Perry!"" The grandparents look like typical old grandparents and even act as if they are suffering from Alzheimer's. Almost from the time they are introduced they seem a little off. This is implied knowing it is a horror movie so it is suspicious when the grandpa is always in his barn and grandma asks Becca to get in the oven to clean it. The film is filled with the typical horror movie cliché's especially at night when the grandpa says the kids aren't allowed out of their room after 9 PM. Many scary incidents occur before the final section of the film where the famous M. Night Shyamalan twist occurs. This unexpected turn of events caps off what is a very well done film from one of the most famous horror directors.Lighting in this film was key to make sure the audience knew something horrifying was about to happen. Scenes with brighter lighting were paired with calmer points in the film. Most of the scary moments occurred in low light situations like a cloudy day, under the house, or at night time. I personally did not think I was going to enjoy this film when I was forced to see it with my friends, but I left the theater shouting about my favorite scenes. The mix of horror and comedy really did it for me and I don't think the movie would have been nearly as good without the humor. I would give this film an 8.5 out of 10 mainly because it was like no other horror film I have ever seen before and was able to make me jump in fear and burst into laughter seconds later. This movie is highly recommended if you are looking for a different perspective on horror and want to have more than one emotion toyed with.",The Visit

Night Shyamalan had redeemed himself after his previous failures. Granted a lot of the past failures were due to lack of creative control. However, that is one of the reasons I decided to watch this film because it would be the first pure M. Night Shyamalan movie in years. So I was going in open minded and ready for anything. One of my favourite movies from this director is The Village and it was with that excitement that I went into this movie. Boy was I disappointed!! To me it felt like the movie dragged on forever and nothing substantially happened until the last 20mins or so. There was no build up like his previous films and the climax was weak and lacked the wow factor. I hope others can relate to this and that I am not the only one that was let down by this potentially great film.",The Visit

579,gregoriuspap,Not really what you may expect,4,12 November 2015,"The plot is interesting but there is no comparison with other movies from the production (sixth sense, paranormal etc). When you see a movie that suppose to compile live scenes of an incident but you constantly find things that make your confuse how live this is, then you get confuse and your attention is trapped to detect how well these ""live"" scenes have recorded. Once the director fails to put you in the ""true story"" plot even you know that this is a movie, it fails to convince you that this is a good movie. Blank points in the plot are adding confusion to the viewer making it hard to enjoy a horror movie. On the other hand, the movie keeps pretty good creepy standards and has some scary moments. The actors made a fair effort for their roles and the direction gave good ambiance to the total work. Nothing more to add for mediocre movie. I wouldn't recommend this as a must seen but rather as a Sunday evening loss of time.",The Visit
580,Jdgane89,A contender for the worst film ever made...,1,12 September 2015,"What is wrong with people? This film is currently rated 7.0?! I didn't think that I would see a film worse than ""Knock Knock"" in 2015 but M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Visit"" could possibly be the worst film I've ever seen. Every aspect of this film is terrible. It has all the cliché problems of the ""found footage"" genre - the shakiness, the perfect Hollywood cinematography when these are supposed to be teenagers with hand- held cameras. The plot is Swiss cheese and the twist can be spotted a mile away (the web cam did it for me). The children are so incredibly obnoxious and their dialogue so pretentious that I wanted them to die as soon as possible.There is a scene in it where an elderly incontinent man slaps a diaper full of feces into a child's face and I can't help feeling this is a metaphor for Shyamalan's career. He can't help producing this trash but he chooses to slap it in our faces and, like the child in the film, we all just stand there and take it. Seriously, no joke - worse film ever.",The Visit

Slow, boring, and easily predictable. I couldn't stand the 'documentary' style of filming, hated the characters and the acting, and wanted to walk out of the movie before it was finished. I keep giving this movie guy the benefit of the doubt but time after time his movies bite the big one.The gist is a mom has a falling out with her parents. Many many years later, out of the blue, the parents want the grandchildren to come visit. Even though she hasn't seen her parents in years, she lets the kids go off on their own to hang out with people they've never met.

583,Joel44410,"The Visit is 2015's greatest horror movie, even with its numerous flaws.",7,29 November 2015,"2015 has been a stale year for good horror. Sinister 2, The Women In Black 2, Poltergeist Remake and Unfriended all missed the mark with critics and audiences (notice how 3/4 are either a sequel or a remake). Unfriended offered the most out of the batch, with higher critical praise and an original concept, at least it has that. A few weeks ago, The Visit opened in theaters worldwide, and I recently had the chance to view it over the weekend. I came into the movie with poor expectations, since it was doing so-so with critics and audiences, and the film's director, M. Night Shyamalan has had a rough couple of films recently. Also, the premise was a bit wonky, seriously, these kids are put in life-threatening circumstances by visiting their grandparents...seriously! Despite those noticeable buffers, I was still pumped to see the movie, hoping for a good horror movie to pass the time. After I sat 2 hours in a movie theater full of wimp audience members (you know the people around you are annoying when you start getting scared of them screaming vs. the actual movie) I walked out impressed.Now, before I begin, you need to know the rest of this review features spoilers. If you don't mind them, keep reading.The Visit, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Sixth Sense, Signs) is a surprisingly satisfying movie. The movie follows two kids, Rebecca, an aspiring filmmaker and Tyler, a kid who wishes he could rap. They have recently been invited to visit their grandparents for the first time in their lives since their mother has parent problems. Once they arrive, a week of horror begins and what you thought couldn't possibly be scary starts to jump at you.First point, The Visit is found-footage, but it's not your average FF movie. Rebecca wants to make a short documentary on her visit, and so the cameras are set-up in a way that reflects what they should actually be viewing. I believe the cinematography in this film hits all the right notes and is by far superior to recent FF movies such as The Gallows and Unfriended.The film's atmosphere was one of it's great strengths. Since this movie is told in a documentary-style, music and sound is limited to what would actually happen in real life. For those who loved James Newton Howard's score on Signs and Unbreakable, don't start detesting the film, because, without music, the movie was 10x more realistic.Now, the cast's acting was exceptional, especially the grandmother (Deanna Dunagan). All actors/actresses fit in with the movie, and never had a sour spot in their performances.That brings me to The Visit's characters. My one pet-peeve of the horror genre is that they never develop a strong protagonist, and I fully believe without a 3-dimensional character, a movie falls apart. The Visit proved exceptionally well at this point, as both the kids were well-developed, or at least enough so that you cared what happened to them. I loved how their mother, played by Kathryn Hahn, was the opposite of the clichéd mother in movies.Breaking away from Clichés was also one of The Visit's strengths. The found-footage, jump scares and plot pitfalls were all either drastically changed or absent in the movie. Even the grandparents used clichés to intensify their horror, since when does your grandmother crawl on the walls?And by far the greatest thing about The Visit was its twist. Yes, this is an M. Night Shyamalan film, so yes, there was a twist. Unlike his recent films, though, this one was perfectly executed and extremely effective. I won't spoil such a great twist, but it really does shift the entire movie drastically, so much so I'd compare the twist to The Sixth Sense, which is notorious for its final twist.So enough with the positives, what were the flaws? First off, I do believe that some elements of the movie weren't needed. This includes Tyler's rapping, the grandpa's period dilemma (although the third act utilized that well) and the overuse of shaky-cam. That kinda sums up all the flaws, though, sorry to bum you out, I know you really came here just to hear me rant about why this movie is bad (but it really isn't).I highly recommend you check this movie out in theaters. My final score for The Visit is a solid 81/100. If you love strange horror movies and have been waiting for M. Night to make a comeback, go ahead and catch a showing, because it's worth it.Thanks for reading, Joel Freecheck.",The Visit

585,dickens-daniel-j,Breathing a Little Life into the Dead Found Footage Genre.,6,26 September 2015,"Probably the most intense final 20 minutes I've seen in some time. Shyamalan is the only director (outside of maybe Wes Anderson) whose movies I always look forward to, even though I'm usually a little or a lot disappointed. Maybe that's part of the appeal, as I keep coming back in hopes of him living up to his full potential, *this time*. The found footage genre is beat to death, but I think it has life to be flushed out by a creative mind, just like anything. It could've been much better, but was downright excruciatingly scary when it was supposed to be. I just hate you have to watch nearly three quarters of the movie for things to get warmed up. But, that's one of the hangups of this genre, and one I wish M. Night would've avoided.All in all, M. Night is still one of my favorite directors, if not only for the sheer character of his movies (some) and I look forward to his next masterpiece, whenever that might be. I definitely have faith in Shyamalan, something I'll never lose.",The Visit

Night does a fantastic job behind the camera. Even though this style of filming has become stale (to me anyways), Shyamalan makes it feel refreshing and new. There are also some truly beautiful and impressive shots throughout the film, which was really good to see. I also really enjoyed the performances from everyone. Especially the two kids, they were surprisingly pretty fantastic. The little boy comes off as annoying at first, but he grows on you. And he ends up being hysterical. Both the grandparents were good as well, but the grandma stole the show between the pair.In the end, I very much enjoyed The Visit. It was an absolute blast. The whole audience was really into it, which really added to the experience. This is one of most fun times I've had at the theater in quite some time. I recommend anyone to go see this movie, and see it with a crowd! Who would have thought Shyamalan was capable of making an intentional comedy? The Visit is truly one of a kind, there's no other movies out there like it. It's so original and so unique, the more I think about it the more I love it.And yes, there is a twist.",The Visit
588,sirkinjn,M. Night Is Back!,8,2 September 2015,"I was fully prepared to be disappointed in this film. I walked in thinking it was going to be another terrible M. Night Shyamalan film. Boy was I wrong. This movie was actually scary, and surprisingly funny.The film is about two siblings who decide to visit their grandparents, whom they've never met. Before the kids were born their mother had a huge falling out with them and hasn't seen or spoken to them in 15 years. The eldest child, Becca, decides to make a documentary about her trip with them and really wants to patch things up between them and her mom. Their grandparents seem normal at first but they soon see some odd things. Nana has sundowners, a form of dementia, and they see her do some crazy things after bedtime. Becca catches her roaming around the house puking, banging doors, scratching at walls, and just acting super strange at times. Pop-pop isn't too normal either. He's hoarding used adult diapers in a barn and gets confused about having to go to a costume party. All things that are brushed off as them being old.Becca is an overly serious filmmaker, or at least she wants to be. Her pretentious attitude is for the most part entertaining. Her brother Tyler is like any younger brother, annoying. He wants to be a rapper which makes for some hilarious scenes. He stole the show. The jokes made were exactly like kids his age. It never felt out of place and a lot of the punchlines were met with applause from the audience.Honestly this film suffered from bad marketing. The first trailer I saw was one scene where Nana asks Becca to get into the oven (photo to the right). And that is it. I think all the trailers made the film seem cheesy and that the plot and twist was going to be a let down. But it really was a good movie and the trailers should be ignored.",The Visit

590,creativerhythm,Worst horror movie ever!,1,15 July 2016,"I am a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan. Truly I enjoy his movies. I feel excited when his movies come to theater halls. With a lot of expectation I sat down on my couch to view this film at around 12A.M. in the midnight so that I can actually get the true feel of what is called as a Horror Film. I saw it with all my patience without missing any of the scenes - be it a 'jump cut' or a shock created by abnormal sound or a faint try to emphasize a nightmarish impact on the viewer's / target audience's intense mind by a group of shaken and shitty shots. Sorry sir, I do admire your skill the whole speaks about, just fail to figure out what is the character of the 'bug' that prompted you to make such a film that only disappoints a human psyche when one tries to categorize this film of yours as a horror movie!

Could it be because of his consistent poor reception; the butcher of 'The Last Airbender;' or his signature twist endings? Does he deserve it?M. Night's new film, 'The Visit,' answers these questions within the first 30 minutes of screen time. Having young actors/actresses star as the main roles so their delivery can be considered ""justifiable,"" shaky cam to assert the filming illiteracy of children making a home movie and elderly performing mentally ill actions as a means of comedy or horror (couldn't tell the difference).It's obvious that M.

My choices were between The Visit and The Perfect Man, so we decided on this film. I went in with the lowest expectations ever, even questioning my decision and considering just calling it a night and getting some much needed sleep instead, but ultimately decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, this film had me laughing out loud, at the edge of my seat and even made me jump one or two times. This is a very clever film with two awesome young actors who just stole the show. Great storyline which keeps you looking for answers and also provides a good message.I think the previews or marketing has failed this film as it does no justice to such a well produced movie.

I am currently working in a movie theatre, so I am always up to date to the latest trailers and movies. This one in particular seems really intriguing. The trailer was great and I really wanted to see all of it.There I was, Première night of The Visit. I started great! The setting, the characters and the whole feeling were really good. The whole ""amateur made video"" kind of view was not really original, but the reason for doing so was oke. A brother and sister, who had never seen their grandparents before, were to visit them in a old and remote house. I was expecting a lot of ""jump scares"" and other scary scenes, because that is where the movie seems to be going. But this movie is labeled a ""thriller"", and not a ""horror"", so the waiting took while. All the aspects were perfect for a horror movie. The setting and story could have been a great horror. Unfortunately, there were no scary parts or other frightening scenes. Instead, there were a lot of unsatisfying scene endings. The story was oke and well told. Some scene were meant to have a lot depth, but failed to come through The second half of the movie was better. More interesting things happened, but not as good as it could have been. I was looking forward to the plot twisting , crazy and sinister scenes, but they fail to happen.In the end it was kind of surprising, although this could have been more.

596,euan_kennedy,Ridiculous,1,24 September 2015,"This movie is by far the most obnoxious piece of garbage I have seen this year. I went into this movie blind, so therefore had no expectations of it being good or bad. By the end, I genuinely wanted to be blind because to experience visual nothingness is better than sitting through M. Night Shyamalan's new flick ""The Visit"" ever again. Let's address the elephant in the room first, the director. We all know its common place in the world of cinema to not expect much from Shyamalan after his long line of flops since the sixth sense. But, even if this movie was written and directed by someone else I would still come to this exact same conclusion. HOWEVER, after torturing myself, I took to the internet to then read a few reviews of what others thought of the movie and to my surprise it's been getting quite a lot of praise. Now, this praise is all false. Nope, believe me everything you have read so far from others giving this movie genuine ""Praise"" has all been bull. Let me break it down. So far, every review I have read has stated that this is the comeback of Shyamalan but a comeback from what? Avatar? After Earth? Signs? The Village? All of which are horrible films and are not so hard to beat in terms of quality. So all of these reviews are just stating that is movie is only slightly better than his last line of flops and we are to praise it just for that alone and not on the movie itself. Hooray guys, he made a movie that just a little bit more watchable than his other ones isn't that great? No. No. No. No. Come on! The Visit is a ""found footage"" horror also labeled as a comedy which is about two kids being sent to their grandparents (whom they have never met) by their mother as she goes on a cruise ship holiday. The whole experience is shown as a documentary filmed by one of the siblings. Now, film school time, the method of found footage has been abused ever since the success of ""the Blair witch project"". These films are very cheap to make and can make a load of cash if advertised right so therefore Hollywood will re-use this gimmick forever as it is and always will be a cash cow. This type of cinema is also the most basic ways of shooting a movie and removes a lot of other variables other film makers would take into account like crane shots etc. So by giving M. Night Shyamalan the most basic way to shoot a movie, he therefore can't screw up a lot of things but just because there are less things to screw with doesn't make this movie any better than any of his other movies. I can make a film about a guy walking from point A to point B and the only thing I can really screw up is by not filming the man and filming something completely different like the floor or the sky and stopping the film before he even gets to point B. Just because I had less to screw up doesn't make my movie any good. Everything about this movie was terrible, even the famous Shyamalan twist could be guessed correctly within the first twenty minutes. The characters are mind blazingly bland, unfunny and pretentious. The kids as far as child actors go are pretty good, but that's as far as ""child actors"" go, everyone else was terrible. Nothing was convincing and every joke was embarrassingly uncomfortable and juvenile making movies like ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2"" look like a Monty Python classic. Just.please.do yourself a favor and never visit ""The Visit"".",The Visit

In some ways the film to me symbolises the difference between the younger generation and the the old timers; the youngsters today are perhaps more relaxed and perhaps desensitised to things than we perhaps used to be. And this is not
always necessarily a good thing.
There are creepy moments and a nice twist towards the end of the movie which keep it entertaining. The characters grow on you, the rapping is clearly a little bit of fun and it doesn't fail to make you laugh (Quote: I had to use two whole Dove bars on my face! ).

When I first saw the trailer I thought that it was actually something worth-watching and Iwas looking forward to see it on the theaters, but it was one of the crappiest movies I had ever watched.

601,miki12345789,Surpassed my expectations!,8,12 September 2015,"Coming into the theater I had no idea that this is directed and written by the one who brought us The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I grab a large popcorn and coke to try and maximize this experience. Having seen a portion of the trailer with my cousin (hence missing the titles that came out by the director) I'm expecting another cheeky horror movie.The first fifteen-twenty minutes come off bright, I smile at the jokes made by Becca and Tyler and just relax, remember to take it easy and not hold up high standards. The movie goes on and, if you've seen the trailer, not everything is as it seems during this lovely visit.Without any spoilers I'll be coming to my conclusion. Shyamalan finds a perfect balance between horror and comedy, and shows us there's definitely chemistry when children and the golden-age is involved. Besides the typical jump scares directed at the kids rather than the viewers, I found this to be a very mood lightening movie that might just bring back my belief, that there's yet more to be added to the horror genre.Probably worth noting, I stopped taking ""scary"" movies seriously times ago, but when it comes to horror-ish thrillers I find pieces like The Perfect Host, Coherence, Triangle and so on, perfect for me. I'm also a fanboy of horror movies shot purely from a camera point of view, and I'll never stop loving them no matter how many clichés are out there.Hope you enjoyed reading my first review! :)",The Visit

Shyamalan is back!!..Not the Best Good step in the right direction.,7,12 September 2015,"When I first heard about this movie and that the Director and Writer was M. Night.... Not gonna lie I was skeptical at first and thought it was gonna be the same Stick from her past movie, but it was interesting enough for me and my girlfriend to check it out.(Sound and design) First i have to say that this movie is a Found Footage movie and I have to say that this is the best use for found footage unlike in other movie where they come up with a horrendous reason to involve it, but this one takes the cake for that and I usually hate found footage. The sound and design are good as typical for an M. Night movie and it does create a calm and relaxing and then creepy and horrifying atmosphere you really get that feeling of emptiness and despair and creates a tense feeling for the audience.(Story and Acting)The story is about two sibling visiting there grandparents, who lives in a house near a small mountain town for the first time due to a bad relationship between The sibling Mother and Parents, but as the days past the siblings start to see some weird behavior from there grandparents and something even more terrifying secrets along the way... By far the acting is really good in this movie and I was expecting some deadpan acting from ""The Happening"" and ""After Earth"" but the acting from the kids and the grandparents are really top notch. The Grandparents especially, they really do come of as weird and derange and it keeps your attention and on your toes through out the entire flick. The pacing of the film is good as well a little off at time due to the fact that they spend over five days at the grandparents house and at time I felt that they glance over days but it is a found footage so its understandable. The does has a comedic edge and it is a welcome edition to the movie because it gives a bit of a relief from the horror section and it actually is funny and does fit with the theme and its rare for a movie to pull this off its obvious that M. Night didn't want this movie to be entirely full of scares.(Overall)This movie is not the Best but the best step in the right direction for M. Night Shymalan and I can say that if he keeps this up then he can surely reclaim his status a great writer and directer from the Six Sense and Unbreakable. I'm really excited to see more from him the future.",The Visit

None of it made any sense.Who sends their kids to relatives that they don't know completely alone without even a conversation and then completely dismisses them when they say there is a problem.

607,timthunnissen,oh Shyamalan... why do you keep mis-marketing your movies?,8,8 September 2015,"As you would have probably guessed from the trailer, this is a found footage(-ish) movie. And let me tell you right of the bat... this is one of the best found footage movies i have ever seen!!Really, i created an account on IMDb, just to write my opinion about this movie to you. And you know why: because shyamalan completely mis-marketed his movie, again! Of his past movies, the village is the best example of one of his mis-marketings. People who went to see it were expecting a horror/thriller and people were excited for it! But what they eventually got was a romance movie, and that is where the hatred started. Okay, his movies from lady in the water through after earth were horrendous, but i thought the village actually was a decent romance movie; beautifully shot, great set design, great actors and so on. Whether you liked it or not, the mis-marketing of the village was the main reason for all the hate it got, and i'm afraid that this is exactly what is going to happen with his new movie 'the visit'. In the trailer, the visit is marketed as yet again another found footage movie, with all the cliché's and what not. When i went to see the visit, i was expecting exactly that and had really low expectations. Instead, what i got was a interesting, tense movie with lots of humour and a smart moral centre. Shyamalan is fully aware of what he is doing as he subletly ridicules movies within the same genre.The story starts off as brother (tyler) and sister (becca) are going on a trip to visit their grandparents. Because of the bad relationship the mother of the two kids has with the grandparents, becca and tyler have never met them. Before they go on their trip, becca decides to make a documentary about their visit to their grandparents and film the whole trip. that's where the camera footage comes in. Right from the start i was intrigued by the characters. Both of the kids have interesting personalities and have great chemistry together. The grandparents are great too, during the movie you are constantly questioning their behaviour. Are they just experiencing some elderly/mental illness, or is there something else going on? The movie can get pretty creepy, and the grandparents play a good part in that. It is one of the aspects that makes the movie so great, it keeps you interested as you want to find out what is going on. Apart from the tensity and the characters, the best part of the movie is it's humour. The kids are hilarious and are constantly making fun of the weird behaviour that their grandparents are showing. Even some of the 'scary' scenes aren't meant to be that scary, as the movie constantly has some subtle comedic vibe over it, and it's clear that shyamalan is doing it on purpose. Me and the rest of the theatre were laughing our asses off, even during some of the 'scary' parts. Although the movie is pretty funny, it doesn't get too ridiculous. The behaviour of te kids stays believable and natural during the movie, which is why the movie holds op as a comedy as well as a horror. During the movie, you're constantly expect something to happen, but instead the opposite happens. Shymalan is kind of teasing with your expectations you got from watching other movies in the same genre. The movie is free of most of the horror movie cliché's that you've come to hate. For example: no f*#$ing jumpscares, or at least barely.To top it all off, the movie has a surprisingly heartfelt moral centre. There are some back stories about the past and what the family has gone through, which lead to pretty emotional moments with a message that a lot of people can learn a thing or two about. All in all; i loved this movie! I was pleasantly surprised with the direction it took. It got me scared, excited, emotional and laughing out loud. There aren't many movies that can accomplish that! And guys, don't get fooled by the trailer and don't get fooled by bad reviews from people who were expecting a scary horror movie but instead got something completely different (just like in the village). Go see for yourself and then form your own opinion about it. Shyamalan has completely redeemed himself in my books, he still has it in him!8/10",The Visit

609,jpaulbrockman,Wildly Enjoyable,9,12 September 2015,"M Night Shymalan hasn't had the greatest reputation as of late, has he? Shymalan came right out of the gate and took all genres of film by storm with his directorial debut in The Sixth Sense, which is one of my Top 10 Favorite Films. Then, he seemed to go downhill a bit from there. Some might argue Unbreakable is his best movie, but I don't agree. Signs has some genuinely great moments in there, but it's FOR SURE not his best movie. The Village is just okay. Lady in the Water is not good. The Happening...wow. This is a ""so bad it's good"" movie, so it's enjoyable. However, The Happening was when people really thought that Shymalan is terrible, which I don't think is true necessarily. But oh God...The Last Airbender and After Earth are AWFUL. However, now it seems...SHYMALAN HAS MADE A COMEBACK! This movie is a return to what Shymalan is best at. Low budget drama/horror. However, he has also added some entirely unique stuff in this movie that is new territory for him.The plot of The Visit is that two kids are visiting their grandparents whom they've never met before, and as their stay goes on, they see that their grandparents are seriously WEIRD and creepy. I won't say much more because there were plot elements in this movie that surprised me greatly that I did not know about before walking in the theater.The Visit adds horror and comedy, and it equals wildly enjoyable results. I can't say that it's gut-busting hilarious, but it's very funny. The horror? I can't remember many scenes where I was really scared, but it has some frightening sequences and moments in there.The part that really makes the horror/comedy gel together so well is the performances. Shymalan has indeed had some horrendous child actors in his films, but the two in this movie are marvelous. They get all the right cues correct in all the appropriate moments. The actors that play the grandparents are so well at portraying these totally messed up people.Found footage has been so overused. The Visit makes it feel very refreshing, though, and it's all thanks to Shymalan's direction. There are none of the dull and stupid found footage gimmicks here. The found footage here makes it feel so REAL, and I can't remember the last time a movie did that since The Blair Witch Project. Also, it also makes perfect sense why found footage is used in the context of the movie. The girl in the movie is an aspiring director. Simple, but perfect.Shymalan is famous for putting mind-blowing plot twists in his movies. While The Visit's twist isn't as much of a powerful punch as his previous ones, it's still pretty shocking.Shymalan's films can be emotionally deep, especially The Sixth Sense. He tries to incorporate that in The Visit here, but I thought these moments fell flat, sadly. They feel out of place and not very emotionally hard-hitting.Remember what I said earlier about how some of this movie is entirely new territory for Shymalan? Well, some people criticize him for having joyless, bland styles in his movies (which I don't agree with personally). This movie, though, has a lot of humour as I said before and is very eccentric. What I am trying to say is this is basically a crackhead's kind of movie. LOL. I, for the record, am not a crackhead. Once again, LOL.Another thing some people do not like about Shymalan's films is their slow pace, which I have no problem with. In fact, I think slow pacing fits in to all of his best movies perfectly. This movie does have a bit of a slow pace. If that is something, you've always disliked about his movies, The Visit may not change your mind about not being a fan of his.Some of my friends made remarks saying how stupid this movie looked from the trailers and commercials. Honestly, I can't recommend this movie to them because those short clips of it are a pretty good overview of what the movie is like. For me, though, as the title says, I thought The Visit was wildly enjoyable.",The Visit
610,thejenniemars,You'll See What You Want To See,5,18 September 2015,"Shyamalan peaked very early in his career. This is a claim some might dispute, as he is still technically a young director and may yet produce some great works. I remember listening to him giving an interview, either on television or in the behind-the-scenes of another movie, where he says that he makes the kind of movies that he wants to see. I disagree with him.M. Night Shyamalan makes the kind of movies he wants to make. Anyone who does anything creative realizes that the process is 100% separate from the final product. Books go through thousands of revisions before the final form is put to print, paintings go through hundreds of sketches, paint mixtures, brush changes, etc. before the final canvas is displayed. For an artist, the creation means so much more than the final product. It is a prideful moment to hold a completed work in your hand, but you can't help but be nostalgic for the journey that brought you there. As a child, M. Night Shyamalan wanted to be a documentarian. He makes no secret of this and often speaks of his early days behind a hand- held camera, directing his friends and family in homemade movies and small documentaries about the minutia of everyday life. This nostalgia for his childhood filmmaking is very evident in this movie. The two main characters are precocious 15 and 13 year olds both of whom have a knack for frames that are juuuust off. You'll notice that it's one of Shyamalan's 'signatures.' He loves the quality lent to film by an amateur's hand, and tries to capture that magic here. For the most part, it works. If you look at this movie as an homage to amateur documenting, or a nostalgic look back at the naiveté of anyone who has fallen in love with being on the controlling end of a video camera, the first 45 minutes are very sweet. As a horror director, Shyamalan has earned a reputation as the 'twist' director. Unfortunately, that is where this film falls flat. Instead of creating a new twist, he borrows from his other twists. Namely, 'they were dead the whole time,' 'those people aren't who you think they are,' and 'don't go in the basement.' The latter being a 'classic,' read 'cliche,' horror movie go-to. As a comedy (because, yes, this is classified as a horror-comedy) it also falls flat. The audience was silent at the parts that were meant to be funny, often cringing at the obvious use of 'look at this! Isn't that quirky and awkward! How humorous!' and laughed at parts that really shouldn't have been so humorous. There is a pivotal scene at the end where the aforementioned thirteen year old bashes in the head of an old man with a refrigerator door. I believe it was supposed to be played serious, it did come at a dramatic climax of the story, but the entire theater was roaring with unsuppressed laughter. The Visit seems like the kind of movie that was more fun to make than it was to watch. Those who go into it expecting to see a Shyamalan horror flick will see just that. Those who go in expecting a dark comedy will find it. Those who go in expecting it to be good will probably get what they want. Those who go in expecting it to flop will not be disappointed. Is this M. Night Shyamalan's comeback movie? Probably not, but he obviously had a damn good time making it.",The Visit

613,gregmpalumbo-48034,"another great treat from M. Night...a thinking persons writer,",10,12 October 2015,"For me, M Night knocked this one out of the park! This film is nearly perfect in it's originality of genre. In my opinion, great scary movies require that their writers / directors have superb filming and story telling skills, as well as a just a hint of comedic edge, so to as to give a roller coaster type of emotion to the viewer. A perfect example - The Shining - King and Kubrick frightened the hell out of us all with the superb characters and Nicholson's chase scene, bringing it to a brief chuckle with the ""Here's Johnny"" line. Ad libbed by Jack N. Hitchcock was a genius of this genre, his method of suspense made the audience feel scared and nervous most of the time while watching his films - and then a sigh of relief and perhaps a laugh. Sadly today's thrillers/horror films are nothing more than cliché of slasher / wacky psycho stories which are no more than a smattering of bad plots, how much strobe like jerk movements a character can invoke, mediocre effects and then -blood scenes. Keep up the thought provoking genre you have re-created Night. Your fans love it. The Naysayers should be watching Friday the 13th/sequels No. 2 through 9. M. Night is a thinking man's storyteller.

Like most of Shyamalan's movies, this one has also an intimate family drama. So it's not only about horror. That's all Shyamalan. And there is also a big twist (don't worry i'm not going to reveal it) ...The acting is great, especially Dunagang and McRobbie. The kid's acting is OK! But I must say that the girl plays better than the boy.On top of that ""The Visit"" is also a kind of (dark) comedy! That's something completely new, I mean have you seen this before?

I honestly was disappointed in the entire movie and did not find it chilling or frightening. When viewing the trailer, I really didn't see much potential in it but decided to go see it after seeing many positive reviews on IMDb. I honestly should have stayed home. While the movie does contain a perfect setting to offer some really creepy scenes, it lacks a ""spookiness"" element to the film and doesn't set the bar for creepiness. I feel like there was something missing throughout the film. All of the actors were believable except for the boy, who i found very annoying. The are a few jump scenes that did offer some scares but nothing major. The ending had an interesting plot twist to it but I felt like there was an emptiness (in the movie) that hadn't been filled.

Possible spoilers.,8,12 September 2015,"A friend and I chaperoned a group date with 7 teenagers 14-15 years old, and my ten year old son; we went to the late show (had a football game first), and the theater was still packed (especially for our tiny town). There seemed to be a pretty even mix of adults and teens waiting to see what M. Night Shyamalan had in store for us this time; since I've seen the majority of his movies, I knew it was going to be weird lol.My friend and I both enjoy ""horror"" movies, and we did jump once or twice; but I'm sure the other people viewing the movie thought that ""those two crazy women in the back need to be committed"" because we spent the majority of the time laughing hysterically. It wasn't that the movie was stupid or anything, it was the fact that BIG, grown men where screaming and hiding their eyes. Some even ran from the room at one point early in the movie.This movie definitely uses the element of surprise, lots of screams from the majority of the audience; they also did a great job of making the scared viewers ""feel better"" by following it up with a bit of comedy.

620,djwarsteed,"Do not see this in theaters! Or even at home when it goes to DVD... Don't even pirate it, it's not worth it.",1,12 September 2015,"So let me just start by saying that I had low expectations to begin with seeing as how this director has failed me in the past MANY times prior, that being said the trailer also wasn't very promising, however my significant other thought it would be at least worth a shot as it was at least a bit of a interesting idea. So this movie is supposed to be a video documentary recorded by the two main characters, similar to ""Blair Witch Project"". The basics of the plot is that the two main characters are sent to their grandparents home for a week to get to know them as the mother had separated herself from them and never really allowed the kids to meet them, nor made the effort to bring the grandparents or children together, and throughout the film the main characters will at times hear things over night or even find the grandparents up to some rather strange things. The problem with this film is really the fear factor feels as though it is missing, most of the movie is shot in plain day and things are ""Relatively"" normal, whilst getting a bit of information on the characters. This is not to say that plain daylight can't be scary, quite the contrary, but even the moments when the movie is trying to really put on a show and frighten the viewer, it just seems to fall short, so much so that I found most of the theater in laughter whenever something ""Scary"" even happened.

The movie finally opened after ten extra minutes of horror previews and my first thought please don't be another The Blair Witch Project. Really The Visit is much worse At some point during the movie the mother of the two main characters, the children, refers to herself as a Wal-Mart employee. She puts her kids on an Amtrak train by themselves to go stay with her supposedly two elderly parents whom she has not seen in 20 years. It's like unloading and stocking the wrong Wal-Mart truck then someone realizes six days later the truck didn't even go to that store. Someone send IMS out to count every item on the shelf. Seriously! Pay attention to the girl's video introductions with each grandparent after they get off the Amtrak. It doesn't sound right.Learned stocking stands out. We see the kids hide the camera, but where do the elderly people have cameras hid? What stands out even more is the double play on both big and small business. What looks like a mom and pop cookie shop turns in our minds to the evil empire as the children's mother turns out to be a Wal-Mart employee and mom and pop have really taken over. The old man said they had to get out of here and that the man across the street was looking at him then the old man attacks the younger, smaller man; the same thing big business does. In the end we see how a couple young teenagers overcome both big and small business through the use of internet, cameras, and video editing.Product placement and marketing hides in this movie. Nearly every verse the boy raps refers to a product or service-""ho"" or should I say Katy Perry. Depends, herbal essence, baking aisle, bakery, electronics, damaged goods discount, bakery, cigarettes, water, seasonal (costume party), soft lines (scarf, yellow sweater, jackets), sporting goods (gun), furniture (rocking chair), oven cleaner Does anyone notice that the oven is built like an easy bake oven in the toy department? Who cleans an oven with a sponge? Who uses oven cleaner on electronics? Sex! The old man has no sex drive. This may be why he dislikes the boy because the boy is the only person in the movie who has a real sex drive. The old woman obviously has some mental, sexual issues. After checking out the girl while she is cleaning the oven the old woman suddenly wants to star in the girl's documentary. The old woman claws at a door naked in the middle of the night outside the children's bedroom and bangs a door open and closed like she wants some pussy. Not to mention she checks out the girl a second time while the girl cleaning the oven. Then there is the end like yeah freaking right. How many times can the Les hook the bed?

All I can say is that you'll have a blast, if you know what you're walking into. I read some of the the reviews of people who disliked it and I was clueless as to what movie they have actually seen because what I saw was amazing. The movie is crafted with heart and subtlety.

Okay... Then why doesn't she call 911, or the PA State Police. Huge flaw. No matter how remote that ""town"" is in PA the State Police could have gotten there way before she arrived there with them at the end of the night. It is a slap in the face to law officials and I am in no way one or even a fan most days to local ones around here. But PA State Police are a different story. So for us to go through the entire film and put aside the belief that a woman in today's world, would just send her children off to people without making sure the people picking them up at the station were actual her parents is far fetched enough. But then to have her make one call to local yokels and then give up and get in the car. Nope. Not going to buy it. The movie scared me at times and that's what I wanted it to do, but I was disappointed in the ending. We guessed the twist way before it was revealed and was forced to play stupid in order to believe the events at the end of the movie.",The Visit
628,timheidner,I really loved the movie.,8,18 September 2016,"First of all I need to say that I got interested in this movie when I saw it was rated 12 here in Germany and a horror movie. I watched it on Blue Ray. It took a little time to understand the way the movie is made, but then I had really much fun with it and also got scared a lot of times. The end had a really nice charm and I would really hope to see more movies like this one. Shyamalan made a great Job there. If someone would ask me for a good horror movie the last years, this would definitely be one of my answers.It is a really great mix of funny shocking and weird.Definitely worth watching.",The Visit

I wish movie theaters had a refund policy...We'd have asked for our money back. The climactic moments shown in the trailer are carefully edited to create an illusion that this film has a lot to offer---Sadly, the film fails miserably. The actors do a decent job of carrying the weak plot - I do give them credit for that - but this film simply fails. There were only 4 people in the theater viewing ""The Visit"" when we saw it, if that says much - Again, I so wish we could have received refunds.",The Visit

The cross between the comedy and horror aspects were difficult to differentiate. With the form of the film hard to follow I couldn't figure out whether or not I would have like to see more horror or more comedy. The acting was fun to watch and the dialogue was engaging. The film wasn't a horrible comeback for M. Night, but I feel it could have been better as a pure horror film or a pure comedy without being a found footage film with a comedic/horror mixture. It wasn't horrible and it did entertain, I would suggest renting this film if you're bored at home with nothing to do.",The Visit
631,kristenweaver,OK movie,6,25 September 2015,"This movie has been in my list to watch since I first saw the trailer come out. My boyfriend and I went last weekend to see it. It did not quite live up to my expectations for what it was making itself to look.I will say the grandparents being not grandparents was a great twist, but it was predictable. It was more of a 'jump out and music scare you' type of movie. All in all, it was to be expected, had its moments. I still enjoyed the film. I give a 6/10. The purpose of trying to make the film a quote UN-quote documentary type film, from the perspective of the aspiring film maker daughter, is a cool view. I appreciate films that try to show a different edge than your typical film. The 'grandparents' were definitely creepy, thank god! The only thing I would have done different would have been to acknowledge the more obvious moments of the covering up the web cam camera. It pretty much told you immediately what the movie was. I guess I just like to find out at the end, keep my mind spinning.",The Visit
632,jdraper-70161,A satisfying suspense movie with quirky comic relief at all the right moments.,8,26 September 2015,"I badly wanted The Visit to be a good movie.After a couple of instant classics (The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) and some decent suspense outings (Signs and The Village), Shyamalan began one of the most bizarre downward spirals in directing history, dedicating the last decade of his career to churning out cinematic train wrecks like Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (LitW was so spectacularly bad that it made my recent list of the ten worst films ever made, a decision that I stand by). When word came out that The Visit would be a return to form, I hoped against hope that this one would save him. Even so, I went in with my doubts; Shyamalan's been known for misleading advertising in the pastwould this be a similar case?As it turns out, no.It's with equal parts relief and pleasure that I can announce The Visit delivers on all fronts, providing suspense with quirky comic relief at all the right moments.This film-within-a-film opens with a wholly believable explanation as to why we are watching found footage: our teenage protagonist Rebecca is an aspiring filmmaker setting out to make a documentary about her broken family. Becca's mother Paula (Kathryn Hahn) became involved with an older man at 19, and Paula's parents did not approve of the relationship. Paula eventually left home under unpleasant circumstances, and she hasn't spoken to her parents in fifteen years...but she won't reveal to Becca why. Deciding that finally meeting her grandparents is the only way to discover the truth, Becca sets out to right past wrongs via her documentary. She and her younger brother Tyler travel to the old folks' isolated home, and it doesn't take long for things to get disconcerting...From the first moment the grandparents (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are on screen, we immediately know something is ""off"" about them. This couple is weirdly detached and robotic—at first it seems like the quirks of old age, but as the film rolls on it's increasingly apparent that something far more sinister is taking place. ""Pop-pop"" is convinced that people following him and that ""a white thing with yellow eyes is waiting for us."" ""Nana"" laughs hysterically at nothing and crawls around on all fours at night. To say anything more about them would only spoil the surprises, and in classic Shyamalan fashion The Visit delivers a satisfying final-act twist.Entertaining as the creepy elderly antics are to watch, The Visit is carried just as much by the performances of Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould as siblings Becca and Tyler. These two engage right off the bat and are characterized to a degree that is rare for a Paranormal- Activity-style thriller. DeJonge is convincing as a sophisticated, slightly pretentious young filmmaker concerned with the ethics of film (she avoids exploitation and staged shots), and Oxenbould steals many a scene as aspiring rapper ""T-Diamond Stylus"" (an element that somehow avoids being annoying).Shyamalan even provides some great emotional resonance, and as we learn more and more about the family's past, we only want the young protagonists to survive the ordeal even more.One thoroughly impressive aspect about The Visit is how the tone switches so effortlessly between tension and comedy. When I saw this in theaters, the audience was engaged by every scene; one moment the crowd was laughing at an improvised rap about pineapple upside-down cake, and the next we were staring down a dark hallway and waiting with baited breath for a crazed grandma to come lunging at the camera. During the oven scene, the theater got quieter than I've heard in a long time.In a genre oversaturated with found-footage films, The Visit will likely go down as one of the few that uses the medium to its advantage. There is no end to the creative angles, and at times it's easy to forget that this is a found-footage film at all.In short, the apocalypse may well be upon us—M. Night Shyamalan made another great movie! I certainly hope this is a sign of things to come from him, because it's been too long since I've enjoyed a Shyamalan movie for the reasons that he intended. Hell, it may even be worth seeing twice, if only to see your friends' reactions.",The Visit

After seeing it just a few hours ago, I can confirm the movie is actually very slow paced when compared to its trailer. As a movie, I'd say it has a very polarizing pace, it's either slow, or very thrilling to watch in some few, very short scenes. This by itself, makes it unable to please everyone.As a horror movie, is one of the best I've seen. No cheap gore, no cheap screaming, no cheap blood. Regarding the last decade it's almost a original one. I must also say that this movie made me afraid of entering my own home. Yeah. Like when I was a 8 year old kid. I'm 31 now.I found the plot and acting very believable, specially Deanna Dunagan.",The Visit
634,IndieCred,Don't wast your money.,3,26 September 2015,"We went to go see ""The Visit"" last night. I figured we could give M. Night Shymalan one more try. He failed. He failed hard. It's billed as a horror/comedy, but it failed miserably at both the horror part and the comedy part.The main characters are two kids who are completely unrelatable in any way, and are so annoying I wanted them to die before the ""scary"" parts even started.The comedy is pretty much ""haha old people are weird and kids like computers, fart joke lolz"".The dialogue was... It actually made me angry. Like, legit furious at points. Shymalan earned millions writing something that sounds like it was written by a Sonic Fanfic writer. Like, he seems to think that the only way to make the female lead kid seem smart is to have her use the most obnoxiously pretentious words possible, and the boy... Ugh. He's an OCD white kids who wants to be black. He raps. Repeatedly. Constantly. Horribly.The ""villains"" were the only redeemable part of the movie, and they got far too little screen time, and didn't do much in general. The crux of the movie was ""Old people are scary because they're weird.""The twist at the end, in Shymalan form, was okay, but not amazing. It's kinda telegraphed....so, yeah. Don't waste your money. Don't give Shymalan any indication that he's welcome in the movie business anymore. I've given him so many chances, and he's failed every time. He's not even a one trick pony anymore. He's a no trick pony, with three broken legs and needs to be put down. Or, alternatively, forced to take writing classes until he understands that thesauruses are a good tool, but should not be the only thing you use when writing dialogue, and that A TWIST IS NOT THE ONLY THING A MOVIE NEEDS.It's truly rare that I walk out of a movie angry that I spent money on it, but this was one of those times. The only reason I didn't walk out halfway through is that I'd spent nearly $30 on tickets for myself and my wife, and I wanted to make sure I got as much out of that money as I could.The only reason I'm giving this movie anything higher than a 1 outta 10 is because Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie's performances were great, and honestly the only thing I enjoyed about the movie, and I want to give them the credit they deserve.",The Visit

It turned out my visit to the theater to see this film was not a good one. The movie was NOT scary at all. The storyline was weak. There was no climax. What parent sent their kids off to grandparents they have never met before, and the kids have not once seen a picture of their grandparents? Very predictable, boring, been done before.

The direction manages to craft a mixture of humor, horror, and heartfelt all into one, making it kind of its own genre.The twist--which M Knight is always known for--was fairly obviously; however, knowing it before hand does not ruin the movie. I say go into the movie expecting it to be fun, and you'll enjoy yourself. The scares are not so much atmosphere as they are jump scares.

This is the kind of movie that makes you wish you could ask for the 90 minutes or so of your life back. I went into this with hope, hope that it would be worthwhile, my hopes were dashed. Maybe it's just me, but there seemed to be a severe lack of suspense, even though I believe that was supposed to be the hook for this movie.I enjoyed Shaknado 3 more than thisAnd I didn't really enjoy that, but at least it did what was supposed to, The Visit didn't do anything that it was supposed to.Edit to add: I would love for someone to explain to me why this is such a love it/hate it movie, there seems to be little middle ground for this.

640,chriscosmato,"Entertaining, Frightening, Funny, Suspenseful, and Well-Crafted",9,4 October 2015,"Like many others, I was skeptical of M. Night Shyamalan. The Sixth Sense, Signs, and The Village are some of my favorite movies, but recent films like The Lady in the Water (which wasn't terrible but was far less enjoyable) and Airbender (which was terrible), left me afraid of how this film would turn out.Fortunately, I HIGHLY enjoyed this film. From what I understand, M. Night set out to make a horror/comedy and truly succeeded. The trailer will give information about the content of this film so I won't try to explain it, but I will mention that this is the first film that has ever motivated me to create an IMDb account just to review it.The scary parts are creepy and suspenseful, particularly when involving the grandma. The funny parts are funny because they show a ridiculous 13 year old kid being a ridiculous 13 year old kid, something we can all relate to in one way or another. I never found myself bored with this film (which, unfortunately, happens often unless a film is particularly gripping). This was due to it's great pacing and relatively short run time.As far as the plot goes, it was straightforward and digestible. There is a twist, as should be expected in an M. Night film, and it left a few things unexplained, but as someone who loves asking questions and dislikes leaving a movie feeling unresolved, there wasn't enough left out to make it frustrating.Finally, I know a lot of people will probably take issue with the camera work, as it is ""yet another"" found footage/documentary style films. I will just say that there is a lot of care into making sure things aren't super shaky the whole film. The cameras are often placed on a flat surface, making many of the shots completely stable, and even the ones that are clearly hand-held are not nearly as chaotic and confusing as many other films I've seen in this genre.This movie is absolutely worth the watch, especially for those who enjoy creepy movies. I enjoyed it so much, I will definitely recommend it to my friends, and I will now be excited for M. Night Shayamalan's next movie.",The Visit

You'll probably think about something better than this. The script is nice and all, but that's it. This movie is consisted of the same thing as cancer cells. The Visit is the worst damn thing that exists in filmography. I've seen better works from some low budget independent American horror crappies. The film is in what lately appears a standard modern ""Katy Perry!!!"" pseudo-documentary form, where something ordinary starts as a normal thing, but suddenly takes an unexpected twist. OK, the twist happens five minutes till the end. The movie is so bad, no worse comes to my mind.

Once the children got to their "" grandparents"" house the old people were acting weird and everything they didn't wasn't scary it was hilarious. I also like the plot twist at the end because it not only added more humor but I could see that the producers were trying to make it have a scary affect.

643,imterinavarro,Decent film,6,8 October 2015,"'The Visit' is a horror film that was directed by M. Night Shyamalan and premiered to the general public on the September 11th, 2015. The movie is 94 minutes long and stars Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie, and Kathryn Hahn. Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are readying themselves for a week long stay with their estranged grandparents John (Peter McRobbie) and Doris (Deanna Dunagan) who they have never met before. They are doing this trip while their mother (Kathryn Hahn) goes on a cruise with her newly found boyfriend. Throughout the week, they notice various things that seem to be wrong with their grandparents. At first they assume the 9PM curfew is just because they are staying with old people. However, they quickly realize that there is something strange happening to Doris. During the first few days of the week they hear scratching and other various loud noises that start to ring alarm bells for Rebecca and Tyler. Later on in the week they try to investigate these weird things by leaving the room and filming the rest of the house after curfew. Through the filming and investigation they quickly realized that both grandparents were beyond mentally unstable. After a week of things like grandma telling them to get into the oven to clean it and a near suicide attempt by grandpa when he was ""cleaning"" his gun; they figured out that something was seriously wrong. At the end of the week the weird and scary occurrences got worse. In the closing scenes when they are skyping with mom she sees the grandparents and comes to the frightening conclusion that the people they have been staying with are not their grandparents. Who could of seen that coming!? Overall the movie was mediocre at best. M. Night Shyamalan in his career has produced some really good and inventive horror films. Unfortunately you always felt that this film was going to be a bit lackluster. This is proof that possessing a great idea and decent storyline still requires the proper execution. The film had you waiting and lead you up to what seemed like a huge shocking end but it was far from that. Once the viewer finds out that they are not the real grandparents, you expect the movie to take a dark turn and really take off. However once you find out, the movie seems to loose momentum and stutter across the finish line. Aside from that, the characters played their roles well and the remote setting of the film was wonderful. The remote setting really added to the creepiness of the grandparents and the town they lived in. Also, considering how young or old most of the actors/actresses were they did a really good job. Additionally the music played it's part and certainly added an eeriness to the film. Minor details like the clothing were done very well also, this added some good realistic elements to the movie even though they were simple details. All in all the movie was decent, but lacked critical elements towards the end to make it a really thrilling horror film.",The Visit
644,miss_pizza_slice,Highly Enjoyable!,8,12 October 2015,"As someone who doesn't watch horror movies because they are all cliché and not scary and, as someone who hated the ""Blair Witch"" style of filming, when my friend suggested watched The Visit, I gave it a massive eye roll.10 minutes in I was moaning. 20 minutes in, it got good.From there it proceeded to keep me entertained until the very end.Firstly, the reason this is so refreshing to me, is because it's creepy with a scary edge, and you can get jumpy from this film because the humour allows you to lower your guard. It's the right amount of everything, weird, creepy, funny, scary.Ed Oxenbould is comedy gold! The reviewers saying this film isn't funny must be Americans. That is the only logical reason for this opinion. I'm no expert, but I can't see why this film is being so harshly reviewed.

The characters aren't dull, it really lets you know who they are so you can get that feel of what they really are going through. The movie is definitely a psychological thriller/horror. It has lots of mental issues people can have at an older age included but the way they introduce them and play them out brings it out as if though you are experiencing it yourself with them. There's lots of little hints here and there through the dialog that can foreshadow events, so if you're one those people who pickup on the small details you'll love it. By the end of the movie your head will have gone from ""alright this movie was so cliché; into, holy crap what the heck I did not expect that!"" If you want a movie that will give you a good scare and have a very thought-out story to it, this one is for you. Also, the scary parts in the early-mid area aren't long but they're definitely good.

In general, I think the soundtrack was weak, but nothing wrong with it, because it still fits the scenes. Also, the movie contains at least 3 jump scares.

The content of the film is not what you expect and it instantly disappointed me when the twist came. Playing with the viewers expectations is always a good thing but it has to be done right. At least i want to see something interesting on the screen until the twist comes. I didn't.There were other semi-off-Hollywood films that had a similar concept but are much more entertaining and thrilling than this one.My recommendation : Watch it and make up your own opinion.But be warned. You will sigh and moan and yell and laugh.

There were only two times in my life in which I literally wanted everyone in the movie dead, good or bad, that being 'Knight and Day' with Tome Cruise, and this piece of garbage. I came to watch a horror movie, not a silly 13 (9?) years old white boy shaming himself while trying to rap. I fast forward those parts, they were just too shameful to watch. How come anyone could possibly believe that someone would let her kids go to their grandparent's house after 15 years without seeing each other, alone?! F*ck at least go with them in order to be sure that your parents are able to take care of 2 kids, you neglectful mom. I won't deny that the parts where the grandma was acting strange were somewhat creepy, but there was a minute in which it became just forced and unrealistic. I'd rather gouge my eyes before watching those kids trying to act again.The kids tell their mom that 'something strange is happening' and she doesn't even ask what it is, she just tries to make her kids shut up by saying 'oh they're just old, don't worry' 'But mom grandpa poops himself and grandma is crazy' 'shut up and make me go watch my boyfriend winning the most hairy chest competition'.As I wanted the kids to die quickly so I could go away, the best part was when the grandpa shoved the poop-covered diaper in the kid's face. That was glorious yet it wasn't enough to keep him from rapping.After your mom finally pays attention to you and she tells you that those aren't your grandparents, what do you do? Nothing. You play Yatzee with the guys and then you don't even try to smash the chair in their faces, and when the fake grandpa locks you up in the room with the crazy woman, what do you do? Keep recording and screaming. You don't put the camera down not even for a second so you could, I don't know, beat her up for good?Why does the police take so damn long to arrive there?Why nobody felt the smell of decomposition?Long story short: the movie is horrible.

The idea that the 'grandparents' were mental patients who had escaped seemed pretty self explanatory from the start. Not only is the twist a complete failure but the movie delivers no real scare. There are a few cheap jump scares throughout, but no suspense or build up. The children in the movie are seldom frightened by the bizarre behavior of their 'grandparents', but they do make a lot of jokes about them and are very sarcastic about everything that happens.

653,xueyuhefu,Not too bad,5,6 January 2016,"It wasn't the best movie that left me trembling, but it was pretty good. At least in the top 10 ""horror"" movies of 2015. (Emphasis on those quotation marks!) I watch horror movies a lot and usually I can tell when a twist is coming. But the twist at the end got me for once. I don't know, maybe I was tired or something. One thing that really annoys me though, is that it seems production companies do not understand genres. There was absolutely nothing horror about this movie. A little weird and creepy, but no horror. It would fit under thriller or mystery and suspense. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER BEGINS HERE: Seriously, I was hoping the grandmother would be possessed or something. That's what I kept thinking was gonna happen. But nope, she's just really sick and a psycho murderer with her husband. I laughed a lot more in this movie rather than being scared. Like when the grandfather attacked a guy across the street, who was looking at his phone, because he thought the kid was looking at him. That was great! And when he put the shitty diaper on the main boy's head, I about died. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER ENDS HERE.Overall, I'll keep it in a neutral place in the middle. It was a good movie with some creepy and funny aspects. But if you want a horror movie, this isn't the one for you.",The Visit

I loved this movie. It was a back to basics simple concept but excellently executed. It will genuinely have you shouting at the screen telling those kids to get the hell out of that house. WHY WOULD YOU GO IN AN OVEN !!.... I was sceptical as to how the found footage camera-work was going to be presented as the shaky hand held nature of these films can be nauseating but the choice to use a an obvious 'steadycam' technique actually made the film a lot more watchable and let the viewer concentrate on the story.

I want to mention one other very annoying thing not connected with the movie, which is that so many people start their reviews with a plot summary. If a plot summary is needed, it is right there ON THE IMDB page for the damned movie. We don't need one from everyone who reviews the movie.The main reason I found this movie to be annoying is the kids. I did not find them very sympathetic. They were way too smug and thought they were so smart. I was pretty indifferent to what happened to them. Also, they were stupid. The girl crawls into the oven not once but twice when the crazy grandmother tells her to, when she already knows something is wrong with these people?Also, the kids make no effort to escape on their own at any time, even after the mom tells them the couple are not their grandparents? The kids could have just run out the door. They could have easily outrun those old people. Then they could have called for help with their cell phones. I am sure two such tech-savvy kids had cell phones. Then, we have the ultimate movie cliche, where the girl GOES DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT and does this AFTER the mother TELLS the kids that the people are not their grandparents. She then calls out to her real grandparents, as if she expects to find them down there watching TV or something. Then she makes sure to scream, so that the crazy couple will know that she is trapped down there.This movie was almost a satire, a collection of ""scary movie"" cliches.",The Visit
666,rodgerinho,Amazing. Best film I've watched in a long time,10,18 July 2016,"Alright so straight off the bat, I wouldn't have watched if I knew it was Shyamalan's film, I've been ducking his work as with Damian Lindelof's for a while now. Ever since The Village, to be honest. Anyway, that's just foreshadowing, if you're anti-Shyamalan, or feel aggrieved or focused on his decline, park it. Trust me. This is a good film. Not a Shyamalan film, just a damned good film. Anything you'd associate with Shyamalan, the predictable, the cheesy, anything you think you know of his films, just doesn't exist here. This is new, and I'm unwilling to say anything too complimentary of Shyamalan in case this is a false dawn or the credit falls elsewhere. If he declines again I don't care, but for this film, it's an absolute success and while he hasn't won me back, he's left me willing to give his movies a chance again, which is pretty massive, in fairness to him.How to review this....hmm....It's really not like other horror films. It's shot as a point-of-view camera film, but it's very appropriate, because the central actress is trying to document the visit to her grandparent's home in the story. It's particularly well done in the sense that yes, she's a young lead actress, but she's also high-functioning and subtle, so she comes across really well as a little budding film enthusiast, she handles her role well.I think all I want to say is: it's engaging, it's character driven, the story and the pacing are really immersive, and the tone goes in places that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. I typically find myself doing something alongside my film viewing, I'll go onto my laptop or do something while I listen. Not this film, it kept me engaged throughout, which is 100% to its credit, few films do that for me.If you watch it, I genuinely feel you'll like it, if you're a fan of horror, then give it a chance, for me it's on-par with The Conjuring. I can't say too much more, but that I have a rule. It's the 30 minute rule, and if a film doesn't convince me it's going somewhere? Then off it goes and I find something else to watch. If you do the same with this film, I'm certain you'll stay right to the end.",The Visit
667,wbiebrick,"I'm not going to talk about the grandparents because there is a twist and the less you know, the better because this twist is absolutely jaw-dropping.",10,4 July 2016,"The Visit (a review by Jye Preston)Back in the day, M Night Shymalan was a genius. He made the horror film The Sixth Sense which I thoroughly enjoyed, he then made another horror film Signs which I thought had good performances, but it was really cheesy and corny at times. Then came The Village and The Happening which really shook my faith in this filmmaker and upon watching these films, I was so angry that I renounced my faith in Shymalan and vowed never to watch another of his films ever again. I didn't go see this film because I was so blinded by rage and hate and also I believed that he will never make anything decent ever again, until now.The Visit is a 2015 found footage horror film directed by M Night Shymalan and produced by Jason Blum, the CEO of Blumhouse Productions, a film company that make low budget horror films that manage to make millions of money. Blumhouse and Universal Pictures distributed this film. The Visit stars Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn. The Visit is about 2 teenage sibling named Becca and Tyler played by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould respectively being sent by their mother played by Kathryn Hahn to stay with their grandparents called Nana and Pop Pop played by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie respectively for a weekly vacation after the mother had a falling out with her parents.When Becca and Tyler arrive at their grandparents house for the week, they start noticing that their grandparents are acting very bizarre and strange and over time they are horrified by their grandparents increasingly scary behaviour and they soon realise that what seems to be a peaceful week stay will very quickly turn into a disconcerting, horrifying nightmare.This film has a lot of things going for it, the entirely of the film is filmed using a hand-held camera in a very similar fashion to Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity and The Gallows. The main protagonists Becca and Tyler are very likable, Becca is a 15 year old teenage girl who is the more straight faced and serious of the two. She wants to become a filmmaker and that is the sole reason why she's filming the events that occur in the film because she is making a documentary to show to her mother. Tyler is a 13 year old boy and he is without a doubt the show stealer of this film. He is immature, funny, cute and a very likable character, he wants to be a rapper and throughout the film he is rapping periodically in the film in a manner like Eminem and his lyrics are hilarious. He's also scared of germs and he has a funny of habit of using singer names when he cusses. I'm not going to talk about the grandparents because there is a twist and the less you know, the better because this twist is absolutely jaw-dropping. To conclude, The Visit is a fantastic horror film with comedic elements thrown in to a successful result. It is well shot, edited, directed, produced and I can sincerely say that this is the best film that Shymalan has ever made since The Sixth Sense and this has finally gained redemption from critics and fans alike of his films, despite him having a bad track record of bad films in the most recent years. This is the kind of film that you need to watch only once and it stays with you for life. It is a masterpiece and this will go down in history as a instant classic and will staple the hope that there are horror films that if given enough effort, can turn out to be good. I cannot praise this film enough, I give The Visit a 10/10.",The Visit

Just damn.,10,17 June 2016,"Just when they thought M Night Shyamalan had lost his touch he come back swinging with a movie that struck fear into a hardened horror veteran and had him screaming for his mama and packing death in his proverbial nappy. ""The Visit"" has Shyamalan reaching for his old techniques and improving on them ten fold with a nail biting, diarrhoea inducing terror fest of epic proportions. I've never understood the unwarranted hate bandwagon people have wholeheartedly jumped on in regards to Shymalan; yes he had a couple of face-palmingly bad films, but in comparison to the intensely incredible ones he's made they should fade to the back of your mind. ""The Visit"" takes us back to his great films with a feeling of giddy nostalgia.

670,dcwilcox-72842,Just shut up and enjoy the movie,8,28 June 2016,"Possible spoilers herein. Pre-review rant: It has become annoyingly fashionable to rip on M. Night Shyamalan in the last decade. That's truly what the scrutiny comes down to: It's cool to hate. In my lifetime I can't think of a single artist in any medium - that produces solid work on a consistent basis - who is subjected to more nitpicking and fussiness than Shyamalan. Do you know why the twist ending of The Sixth Sense was so great? Because you never saw it coming. You didn't even know there was going to BE a twist. You thought you were watching a by-the-numbers ghost story, until eureka! Plot twist. But by the time most viewers got around to seeing The Village or Signs, they had become so jaded that they couldn't even enjoy the picture. They sit in the cinema with their arms folded, waiting for a twist ending that they've already decided they're going to hate, instead of letting the movie unfold and play itself out. I'll admit Shyamalan has had a few duds (The Happening and The Last Airbender come to mind), but give the man a chance, won't you?Where does this cynicism even come from?As for The Visit, this represents another solid outing for Shyamalan. Much has been made of the movie's ""found footage"" style, and how the sub-genre has already been exhausted by other filmmakers. Again, if you let this movie do its thing, you'll see that the effect is used as a *critique* of the style, that Shyamalan is sending it up as something of a parody. At the same time, the style works to illuminate his characters better than I believe a traditional structure could accomplish. And it's the characters - and the actors playing them - that truly drive this movie. Olivia Dejonge is convincing as a troubled teenager, and avoids succumbing to the hackneyed brooding/goth archetype that's so prevalent in this genre. Peter McRobbie is also serviceable in his role as the grandfather, alternating between aloofness and menace.But it's the other two leads (Ed Oxenbould and Deanna Dunagan) that give The Visit its lifeblood. Oxenbould is instantly charming and charismatic, forsaking the endangered hopelessness that his type of character is prone to. Not to give too much away, but he displays a myriad of talents in this movie. Dunagan is the true star of the show however. You can tell she had a lot of fun making this movie, the way she throws herself around the set and commits to every terrifying tick that's been written into her character. The Visit is worth watching for her performance alone. Forewarning: if you're not a fan of Shyamalan's visual style, you won't like this movie. The Visit is laced with his trademark quirks, his skewed camera angles, his long stationary shots, his penchant for putting children in the line of danger, his scenes of non-sequitur, eclectic dialogue. At times, the movie can seem over-plotted (a warranted complaint of his previous movies). If you're worried about Shyamalan himself making another forced cameo, breathe easy, as he never steps out from behind the camera. And if you're dreading another plot twist, well, c'mon. It's M. Night Shyamalan. But don't go into it - or avoid it - just on account of the twist. Enjoy the show. Let its weirdness grab hold. The Visit is unnerving, creepy, and clever. It has personality, which modern horror films are sadly lacking. It has nuance, which is likewise a rare commodity. It has a sense of humor, which is necessary to offset its more unsettling moments. In all, it's entertaining. And isn't that enough for any movie?",The Visit

Sorry, but that's not what i saw, and if Shyamalan has taught me anything, it's that there is no extra layers on his works, not that it's a bad thing, but he simply plays by ear and it works for him (and his fanbase? I suspect he has one of those).",The Visit
