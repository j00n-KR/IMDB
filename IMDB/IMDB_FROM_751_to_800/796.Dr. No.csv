0,MartinHafer,A great Bond film for those who hate all the silly gadgets,9,23 March 2008,"I have trouble enjoying most of the James Bond films because I also read the books. The original Ian Fleming books generally had nothing to do with the films other than the title and the books also differed in many ways concerning Bond--his style, his personality and mission. Bond was NOT a love 'em and leave 'em guy in the books. Sure, he slept with some women, but he was far less randy and was more of a cold-blooded character. While Bond is too suave and nice in this film, he was closer to the real Bond than any of the subsequent Sean Connery movies. As far as the plot goes, this film was also much closer to the original source material--though Dr. No was NOT operating a nuclear base and his ending was far less exciting in the book (believe it or not, he was crushed to death by a load of guano in the Fleming story).In addition to being more faithful, I also liked this Bond because this is the only time I can remember Bond actually killing someone in cold-blood. In the wonderful bedroom scene, he COULD have let the would-be murderer go, but instead took pleasure in playing with his victim like a cat playing with a mouse. It may just be one of the best Bond scenes ever.Something else that really stood out for the better in this film was Jack Lord as the first of many Felix Leiters. Oddly, in each film, a different guy played this CIA man. I don't know why they didn't try to keep a consistent actor for the role, but I bet they didn't use Lord again because I am sure many ladies in the audience thought he was better looking than Connery--something that might distract from his movie image. If you don't believe me, look at the later Leiters--all rather homely or non-distinctive. Oddly, one, from THUNDERBALL, looked a bit like Danno from Hawaii 5-0--but he was given so little screen time that there wasn't a chance to steal any of Connery's glory.All in all, there was very little not to like in this action-packed but more believable Bond film. Sure, it was different from the book, but this is one case where I think this actually wasn't a problem--the way the book ended was pretty anticlimactic. See this and you've seen the best Sean Connery Bond film, as it's intelligently written and rather free of the usual silly gadgetry.",Dr. No
1,TheLittleSongbird,The one that started it all....,10,18 August 2010,"I am a fan of the series, though I do have to admit there are some bad eggs and some golden treasures. Dr No is one of the golden treasures, along with Goldfinger and From Russia with Love. Dr No also happened to start this great series off, and with great style and panache. It is very cleverly conceived, and remains true to the essence of the novels. The cinematography and locations are stunning, and the music and theme song are wonderful. The action sequences are simply terrific, the atmosphere is appropriately exotic and the humour displayed is very witty. The dialogue is great, the plot is well done and the direction is solid. Ursula Andress couldn't have asked for a better entrance, while the ever suave and charismatic Sean Connery is perfect as the dashing, debonair and ruthless title character. Overall, a great start to a great series on the whole. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Dr. No
2,bkoganbing,Channeling Fu Manchu,6,2 May 2009,"Like The Road To Singapore, Dr. No was the first and not the best of the James Bond films. But it set certain standards and norms for what fans came to expect from Bond features. First and foremost a suave, but very capable and dangerous Sean Connery in the title role. Though this film made Sean Connery an international star it took him years to get a commercial hit in which he wasn't James Bond. It frustrated him no end and I can certainly sympathize. As I've said in other reviews, I like Sean Connery as an actor, but as James Bond I've always preferred Roger Moore.That being said Ian Fleming for his Oriental villain Dr. No in which Joseph Wiseman does a superb job, reaches further back into literature and channels Fu Manchu into his character of Dr. No. Wiseman has been using a small private island off of Jamaica for a scheme to disrupt the American space program. Just a few years back the USA had a series of spectacular failures in its space program while the Russians were forging ahead. This film gives us the proposition that there is a sinister force behind our failures, that force being Dr. No and the third echelon behind him, SPECTRE. The organization SPECTRE would appear in many more Bond features. A trio of delightful beauties appear in Dr. No who become the first Bond girls. Zena Marshall is the SPECTRE agent planted in British Intelligence, Eunice Grayson as a lovely beauty Connery leaves at a gambling club when duty calls, and finally Ursula Andress whose a diver looking for seashells who accidentally stumbles into Bond's mission to foil Wiseman.One thing that dates Dr. No terribly is the climax. I can't say what happens, but the results should have been Chernobyl like all over the Caribbean. That's something I'm sure Ian Fleming didn't take into account when he wrote the book.Still Dr. No is great stuff and it sets the Bond standard.",Dr. No
3,Leofwine_draca,So this is where it all started...,6,5 July 2016,"The first Bond film has a large fan following who consider it to be a great movie. Maybe I'm missing something, but this is a film which lacks a little in the way of pace and even budget. The latter is not always a hindrance but it certainly shows things up in the explosive finale which is obviously achieved by a miniature. The trouble is that the producers and scriptwriter were obviously still finding their feet with the new character and had not settled into the fun template of action/chases/romance/danger which the later episodes of the series would fall into. What we're left with is a film which is is very talky and in which the action slightly disappoints: a car chase is ruined by poor back projection, the fight scenes played for laughs instead of drama.Things do pick up towards the end, with Bond's arrival on the secret island, but up until then we have to ensure the laconic pacing and smug countenance of Sean Connery. I know Connery is a lot of people's favourite Bond but personally I don't rate him as such - Roger Moore will be the one and only Bond for me. To be fair, Connery settles easily into the role with a minimum of awkwardness, but he's just not that believable as a top secret spy. At least he would get more settled in, in later years, before he became bored with the role and gave it up.Glamour is lent by the Ursula Andress (complete in her memorable bikini) but this actress was never renowned for her acting ability, as evinced by her descent into Italian exploitation fare in the '70s with the likes of MOUNTAIN OF THE CANNIBAL GOD. She's also on screen for a surprisingly short period of time. The rest of the cast is pretty good, from the underused Jack Lord as Felix Leiter to Joseph Wiseman as the hammy, metal-handed villain. Rather offensively Wiseman, a Westerner, is employed to play the supposedly Oriental villain a la Christopher Lee in the FU MANCHU series - were there no good Oriental actors around at that time or something? Thankfully the film does have some good bits. The famous theme tune was never better than here, although it is played at odd moments and at other, exciting bits the soundtrack is surprisingly silent, which saps the film of some of its excitement. The (few) gadgets are nice, there's a cool fire-breathing dragon which toasts a guy and turns out to be an armoured vehicle, and the villain's lair is well-realised at the end of film. The only problem being that I was expecting something a little better-made; even the Italian rip-off of this movie, LIGHTNING BOLT, was more action-packed and entertaining. It deserves a status as being the first but was easily surpassed by later Bond entries in my opinion.",Dr. No
4,SnoopyStyle,First for Iconic Franchise,8,9 December 2013,"Assassins called ""Three Blind Mice"" kill a British agent in Jamaica. James Bond 007 (Sean Connery) is called in to investigate. In Jamaica, he finds the cooperation of CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord). They investigate a mysterious Chinese gentleman named Dr No (Joseph Wiseman).It's a tougher, grittier version of 007. He's not above roughing it up. It's before the cute martinis and Q. But we do get the first Bond girl Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress) and the iconic music. And Andress is so good at it. In fact, it's fascinating to see so many of the Bond trademarks already in use in the franchise inauguration. Heck, they are doing product placements already.The story is pretty straight forward and the only exotic location is Jamaica. Budget constraints probably played a part. But they used everything to full effect. It has enough tension to drive the pace all the way through. The few slow spots are limited and do not slow the movie in general. I will say that radiation decontamination has never looked sexier.",Dr. No
5,Hitchcoc,Probably the Real Bond,8,20 March 2014,"This, of course, was the start of an empire. As Sean Connery graced the screen for the first time, one of the most recognizable figures in cinema was born. Since there was very little knowledge of the bond literary canon, the producers went into this not knowing the eventual impact this would have. As a matter of fact, if someone else other than the suave Connery had accepted the role, would the series still be alive today? The neat thing about this film is that it is a more conventional secret agent movie without the aid of huge special effects and extravagant plot elements. It is about a very adept secret agent who is dealing with a threat to the world, based on the manipulation of existing missiles. Bond finds himself in Jamaica facing off against the notorious Dr. No. He finds under the seemingly normal facade, a masterwork of technology, designed to bring death and destruction. Naturally, the producers knew what they were getting with Connery and had a sense of humor. The unflappable character weasels his way into the facility, facing off against the henchmen. He beds beautiful women and strikes poses, delivering magical lines only the most enigmatic of characters could deliver. Connery's name is tied to incredible confidence and self assuredness. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder is the first Bond Girl. Unfortunately, her career never really produced much, but she has this.",Dr. No
6,Horst_In_Translation,The beginning of it all,6,9 June 2015,"Unless you count the Barry Nelson television episode from eight years earlier, this one here is the beginning of the James Bond franchise and over 50 years and 20 movies later, it still looks in great shape constantly drawing huge audiences to theaters around the world. Who would have tought so back then. Let me say a few words about those people tat worked on this movie, also behind the camera: The director and one of the many writers is Terence Young, who was in his 40s at that point and even if he worked on many other films over his long career, these Bond movies are what he is known for today. Kinda fittingly with where this film is set and also with the villain's ethnicity, Young was born in China himself. The novel is if course by Ian Fleming and when this got made, so the franchsie basically started, he was still alive (even if close to his untimely death) and I am kinda eager to check out after this review of mine what he thought about this movie here. Well, Emmy nominee Richard Maibaum is probably the defining writer when it comes to the Bond universe. There from the start and he stayed for decades and was even still a writer when Dalton played 007 and wouldn't he have died then in his early 80s, he probably would have stayed even longer. A legend of the Bond universe! With Johanna Harwood, a woman contributed as well. She is mostly forgotten by now, but that deserves a mention, also that she returned for the second 007 movie. Berkely Mather was more prolific, but not much to say about him. He worked on The Avengers, which had nothing to do with today's, but it was a spy series and even if he only contributed to one single episode (according to imdb), it may have helped him to get in here because of the contents and because it was in 1961. And finally Wolf Mankowitz: 1962 was a career year for him as he won a BAFTA and he had several nominations before that, so you could say that these were the days when he was peaking, still under the age of 40 and he did not return to the follow-up films, but instead contributed to the Casino Royale spoof five years after this one here.These 110 minutes (not super long or super short for a Bond film) we got here were the film that made Sean Connery a star. He was the first of so far six (official) Bond actors. However, when people talk about the great old James Bond films, ""Dr. No"" is rarely mentioned. It's more about ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Goldfinger"". Still I believe that this is a pretty good film. It has several very tense and entertaining scenes. One of them comes very early when that fake driver waits for Bond at the airport. Seeing Bond there and the way he looks outside when he is told that nobody was instructed to pick him up at the airport was really haunting. So nicely acted by Connery and you already knew immediately, you sure would not want to be in the footsteps of the fella waiting outside. There, Bond's desire to pull through already became obvious because he had to convince the fella to go inside and not let him do his work, so he could make the crucial call and realize what's going on. Even if otherwise he would have been skeptical and careful too of course. I also must mention the three blind mice scene right at the beginning of the film. I love this tune. And it's pretty interesting how these rather helpless blind men end up being absolutely cold-blooded contract killers. A bit of a shame they did not return later on and we could have seen 007 take care of them. The beach scene at the island deserves a mention too, even if I don't think it was as defining as many others do. Or when Bond meets Leiter and his local helpers on this dangerous mission. Yes, Felix Leiter is already in this movie and he appears in many other Bond films too. Moneypenny is already in here as well and so is M. Q, however, is still missing. But very early on, when Bond talks to M, there is a fella with a bit of technical background there to assist Bond it seems. The family members of this actor should say that one of them was the first M kind of. I am sure Llewelyn's folks will be okay with that.There are several dramatic scenes in here with poisonous spiders (so haunting to see it move under the blanket), seductive femmes fatales and even a dragon. Connery makes Bond his own with his approach which includes breaking a villain's neck before he can alert the other enemies, but also some humor (the funeral comment for example after the car chase or when he asks one of the maids for plane tickets) here and there, especially when he meets Honey Ryder. His comment to her that she should obey the men when they tell her to undress is priceless. He sure loves the ladies. Dr. No is a good villain, but none of my favorites. Wiseman adds an aura of mystery to the role and I liked that. Actually, I rather expected him to win a Golden Globe for Newcomer of the Year instead of Andress. He wasn't a very known name before this film either. Oh well. Guess the voters were blinded by her charm. I didn't think she was that outstanding in her role. Basically all her actions just had the purpose to define Bond as character in my opinion. And I didn't find her that hot either, so I'm always a bit surprised when she leads the list of best Bond girls which is frequently the case I believe. Somehow I also kept mistaking her for being from Sweden when truth is she is from Switzerland, but yeah, I think she is one reason here why this film is not truly considered a classic or remembered by as many as some of the other Connery films. The moments when they wanted to give her significance by making another spider reference, also to a pretty cold-blooded killing, felt for the sake of it and in the end, she is really nothing but the girl constantly with Bond, who does not have great depth and is basically just a beach girl collecting shells to make some money. I won't deny it I was a bit glad when Dr. No agreed that she was useless and had her removed. I thought the Asian actress/character from earlier, the one Bond put in the car with his folks, but not before sleeping with her at least once, was almost more interesting. Not the only evil lady in here. Take a look at the photographer early on. Or the maids working for Dr. No.To make up for some of the harshness towards Andress in the previous paragraph, let me add that I find it nice that she is still alive now at a pretty old age while other Bond actors and Bond girls too have died a long time ago already and this is the first we have here, which makes it even more respectable. She was around the age of 25 when this got made, Connery was 30 or 31. Maybe it's not only the scene at the beach that made her famous, but the nudity, even if we see nothing, in that scene when they are in the shower to remove all the radioactivity helped her as well. That was at the villain's headquarters already. The first helper of said villain we see is also one that stays in the mind, not only because we know quickly that this driver is not one of the good guys as I stated earlier. It's also the scene in which he kills himself instead of giving out any information that is one easy to remember. Nothing uncommon today anymore and a story arc they often use nowadays, but back then it felt like a pretty daring choice. I'm glad they included stuff like this and did not keep it harmless. Speaking of the villain's headquarter, when Bond was finally treated like a prisoner, the way how he manages to get out of his prison there was nothing that impressed me too much and the transition from how that to how he was in costume posing as one of the scientists there felt a bit rushed. We entered this final act quickly. I did like the raudio commentary we hear at the same time about the successful rocket launch. They had no idea how close they were to catastrophe. Those were surely moments when the Bond song could have played, but they did not really have one here. Instead, we hear some fairly joyful tunes at times that could also be played in a movie taking place on Hawaii. But it worked nicely too, so I won't complain.There are some more minor criticisms I have nonetheless, but none of these were really that grave. Bond movies are not the perfect choice if you are looking for films that have the most realism, but it's okay as it usually sacrifices it for better entertainment value. Bond villains will never learn to kill Bond right away when they catch him. Instead, they treat him like a guest in a super expensive hotel and tell him their plans in detail. Here it was especially absurd. Dr. No did not give me vibes of a true narcissist the way Auric did two movies later. And yet he treated Bond like a guest at times, one he really wanted to impress and on one occasion he even said that he respects him. Respects his judgment and opinion. Not verbally though. Somehow it did not feel right, especially as Dr. No is really one who wants Bond dead from the very start as we find out when he talks to his key henchman. The ending scene with Bond succeeding in destroying Dr. No's plans was okay, but not overwhelmingly good, like the one in Goldfinger for example. The fight and how it ended with the doctor's metal arms being the reason why he cannot hold on before he vanishes in the liquid was good though. I talked so much about Goldfinger here, forgive me for that, but how can you not like that movie and Fröbe of course. One crucial difference between the villains is also that the latter appears in the very first scene almost and here we have to wait until almost the end to meet Dr. No, even if we hear his voice earlier already. But from the title (the German title even more obvious), we know right away that he is the main antagonist here. All in all, I quite liked ""Dr. No"" and I recommend it, especially to lovers of spy movies. Then again, it's such a classic that these certainly have seen it already anyway. Enjoyable and tense. Easy to enjoy too without knowing the books. Thumbs up.",Dr. No
7,claudio_carvalho,The Beginning of the Most Successful Franchise of the Cinema History,8,14 February 2013,"When the British agent John Strangways and his secretary vanish in Jamaica, James Bond (Sean Connery) is assigned by M (Bernard Lee) to investigate what might have happened with the agents. 007 teams-up with the CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) and the native Quarrel (John Kitzmuller) that works with Feliz, and he learns that Strangways was investigating the Crab Key Island that belongs to the mysterious Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) and is very well protected by armed guards. Soon they learn that Dr. No is toppling the rockets launched by the NASA Cape Canaveral and 007 goes to Crab Key with Quarrel to seek evidences against Dr. No. They meet the sexy Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress) collecting seashells in the island. They stay together but soon they are found by the security guards and arrested in Dr. No's facility, and James Bond learns the evil plan of Dr. No and The SPECTRE.""Dr. No"" is the first 007 movie and the beginning of the most successful (and probably also the most ancient) franchise of the cinema history. The charming story presents the hot Ursula Andress as the first Bond girl and she never disappoints. I had seen ""Dr. No"" on VHS for the last time on 28 January 2000, and I have just seen this movie again in a magnificent Blu-Ray of the James Bond's collection. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""007 Contra o Satânico Dr. No"" (""007 Against the Satanic Dr. No"")",Dr. No
8,mark.waltz,"The comic strip starts here, and oh what a fun ride it has been!",7,1 September 2017,"When the camera first raises its lens on Sean Connery, he simply says, ""Bond, James Bond."" Then there's that oh so familiar music; Later on, the martini, shaken not stirred. (Bruises the gin, we were taught in ""Auntie Mame""). But then, there's the beautiful woman he agrees to meet for dinner later who somehow drops completely out of sight. Was she a victim of the Calypso ""Three Blind Mice"" we saw over the final seconds of the opening credits? After traipsing down a beautiful beach road, they suddenly opened fire on a secret agent and his brand new secretary in Jamaica, apparently for no reason, even after the secret agent put money in one of the man's cup. That brings Bond to Jamaica where he gets to meet the notorious title character, living flamboyantly on a forbidden tropical paradise island, the first of many mad men to want to take over the world, a premise deliciously copied by ""General Hospital"" in its over the top ratings heyday when Luke Spencer found himself on an equal beautiful tropical island trying to bring down a mad man with the same goal.For those of you who look for ""unacceptable"" behavior by movie heroes of the past in today's p.c. society, you'll have a field day. He flirts with Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) but is non-committal, has a brief tryst ended with her being arrested for his attempted murder, and has a beautiful female photographer assaulted for taking his photo without her permission. So yes, he's a bit of a sexist pig, but he's a gorgeous one, and audiences were easy to look the other way. After all, it's Sean Connery at his best looking, so fit and trim, and that's what you get for the original Bond....James Bond. This is also one of the few times when you get to see Bond actually kill somebody in cold blood. Usually, their deaths are accidental or come thanks to one of the devices he gets from boss ""M"", a plot device which is not used in this film. But of course, there's the humor in these deaths, such as the fiery end for somebody following him which results in Connery telling a witness that the driver was obviously on their way to a funeral.That gorgeous but dangerous island paradise is certainly striking to look at, and rumors of a dragon prove to be semi-true. If you are afraid of spiders, be warned; There's a very close call for Connery with a rather large tarantula that gets a little too close to that gorgeous face for comfort. We know now that Bond would be back so there's no worry of him being bitten, but still, seeing that thing crawling so close to his face does give me the heebie-geebie's. On the island, Connery encounters the first real ""Bond"" girl, Ursula Andress, oh so gorgeous, oh so curvy, oh so smart. There's a horrific end for the kindly boat captain who takes Bond out to the island of Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman). I wanted to see more of Jack Lord as an American agent who briefly aids Connery, sort of ironic considering his later heroic role on the exotic TV series ""Hawaii Five-O"". Yes, this has all the clichés that would pop up in pretty much every Bond film made afterwards, but each one had their own style that made them so much fun, especially if you were lucky enough to see them on the big screen with a huge bag of popcorn. Bond villains, we can pray, do not exist, but it's always fun to see the build-up of their evil schemes and how Bond manages to take them down. Unlike later Bond films, this one just ended and did not give signals of a follow-up. No mention of another Bond movie appears in the final credits, although there is a final clinch with Connery and Andress that would be utilized in many of the future films, even with the others who followed Connery.",Dr. No
9,classicsoncall,"""We can't all be geniuses, can we?""",7,6 September 2018,"With a great deal of hindsight this was a great movie, but boy oh boy, it sure hasn't aged well. Can you even imagine that the Sean Connery of today is the same guy who appeared in this, the very first film of the long running James Bond series? He certainly looked the part and played it well, and if I had to place my bets, Connery would have been my favorite Bond of all. But the early films are certainly dated and don't translate very well today. At least in this one, Bond seems a bit more competent than he did in ""Goldfinger"", where he got captured by the bad guys more than once, and looked rather awkward and clumsy fighting villain Oddjob. I was also taken aback for a second when Cape Canaveral was mentioned, but here it was 1962 and John F. Kennedy was still alive, so it hadn't yet been renamed for a decade before returning to it's prior designation.The thing is, if you think about it, if this wasn't a James Bond film, it probably wouldn't enjoy the same status that it does for all the devoted fans who love the series. Consider James Coburn's 1966 film ""Our Man Flint"" as an example of what I'm saying. That one rates a 6.5 rating as I write this compared to a 7.3 for ""Dr. No""; not that much of a difference really, but if Connery had headlined 'Flint' as Double O-7, that flick would probably rate a lot higher. I guess what I'm saying is that times change and tastes change, and what was once considered monumental looks a whole lot different in the present day.But you know what? I guess it doesn't really matter. Bond saves the day for the American space program and winds up getting the girl, and to be quite honest, Ursula Andress would have been a catch in any era. Her characterization by the way is another one that wouldn't pass muster today for the obvious reasons, but at least she didn't have a name like Pussy Galore. But what's the deal with a guy named Puss Feller?",Dr. No

There was plenty of what I expected -- vodka martinis, nice cars, women with unusual names. But there was also some I did not -- far more detective work than your average spy, and fewer explosions and action scenes than I would have thought.A great movie? Maybe not quite. But definitely a pretty good one. I was most amused by Sean Connery's attempts to suppress his accent, and how it was not always successful.",Dr. No
11,lee_eisenberg,Ursula Andress in the bikini,10,13 July 2005,"When ""Dr. No"" first came out, it was like a karate chop on standard Hollywood fare. While Tinseltown was still making ""family fun"", this movie had it all: action, mystery, and scantily clad hot babes (meaning a lot of sex). And watching this movie, it's easy to see why even today, so many women consider Sean Connery a fox. Of course, my favorite part was when Ursula Andress walked out of the sea wearing next to nothing.The main thing that we can derive from ""Dr. No"" is that Sean Connery was the only real James Bond. The James Bond movies today are nothing but a series of gimmicks. This movie is what entertainment is all about - partly because of the Jamaican soundtrack, but mainly because of Ursula Andress (zowie!).",Dr. No
12,jboothmillard,Dr. No,10,24 February 2005,"Bond, James Bond in his very first outing, unless you consider the new Casino Royale. Sir Sean Connery begins the 007 collection in style and excellence. He is suave and cool, not many gadgets yet, but still cool. Set during the cold war, when spies were most known, an unknown power of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Special Executive for Counter Intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) is planning to attack US space launches. Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) and Crab Quay are the only links that Bond and MI6 have to go on to solve this investigation. This is probably the Bond film with the best Bond girl, her entrance was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, Golden Globe winning Ursual Andress as Honey Ryder coming out of the sea in the white bikini. Also starring Jack Lord as Felix Leiter, Bernard Lee as M, Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent, Zena Marshall as Miss Taro, John Kitzmiller as Quarrel, Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench, Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and Peter Burton as (the original) Major Boothroyd.

13,Woodyanders,"A solid and enjoyable, if rather ragged cinematic introduction to James Bond",8,15 September 2009,"Ace British secret agent James Bond (the incomparable Sean Connery, smooth and suave right from the get go) has to stop nefarious criminal mastermind Dr. No (excellently played to the wicked hilt by Joseph Wiseman) from destroying the US space program. Terrance Young's stylish and assured direction maintains a steady, if somewhat sluggish pace throughout, stages the sporadic stirring action set pieces with considerable skill, and delivers a vivid evocation of the flavorsome Jamaican setting. Although the formula had yet to be perfected, the basic ingredients for an engrossing and entertaining 007 outing are present and accounted for: gorgeous gals aplenty (statuesque stunner Ursula Andress in her white two-piece bikini as gutsy diver Honey Ryder rates as a positively delectable sight), a truly hissable villain, a nifty animated opening credits sequence (alas, there's no catchy theme song), exotic far-flung foreign locations, and a rousing explosive climax. Moreover, this movie is more plot-driven than other latter Bond pictures, with very few gimmicks and only a handful of action scenes. The cast are all in sterling form: Connery commands the screen with his winning mix of cocky charisma and sly machismo, Andress brings a disarmingly sweet innocence to her part, Wiseman makes the most of his regrettably limited screen time as a worthy adversary, plus there are fine supporting contributions from Jack Lord as shrewd CIA agent Felix Leiter, Bernard Lee as Bond's stern superior M, Anthony Dawson as the corrupt Professor Dent, John Kitzmiller as helpful local cop Quarrel, Zena Marshall as enticing femme fatale Miss Tao, Eunice Gayson as the fetching Sylvia Trench, and Lois Maxwell as smitten secretary Miss Moneypenny. Monty Norman's swinging score hits the groovy spot while Ted Moore's slick cinematography boasts plenty of neat gliding pan shots. Unfortunately, this film looks a bit cheap and seems a touch drab compared to all the more lavish sequels which followed in its extremely influential and successful wake (the slowly trudging fire-belching tank is frankly kind of laughable and unimpressive), but overall it's a sound and satisfying start for the famous series.",Dr. No
14,ccthemovieman-1,"Okay, But I Miss Those James Bond Gadgets & Humor",6,17 February 2008,"Having watched all James Bond movies through four decades, watching this again in the late 1990s turned out to be a disappointment. What was new and exciting on film (James Bond) in 1962 now is colorless, humorless and almost the point of being called ""boring."" It's hard to imagine a James Bond film called ""boring,"" but take a look at this and see if you agree.There's just no spark here. It's a straight adventure with none of the gimmicks and fun that became trademarks for James Bond flicks. The cinematography was nothing and the story is a bit dated as well. Another negative is the lack of humor. Comedy is one of the big trademarks of the Bond movies, as everyone knows. You won't find it in this movie.Ursula Andress is the only person worth watching, and she doesn't show up on screen until just over half of the film has been completed! Also, as a note, Jack Lord of ""Hawaii Five-0"" fame played American CIA man ""Felix Leiter,"" the only time he did so.If I want Bond as part of a straight spy story, I'll read Ian Fleming's books (which I did) but for the films, I want to see the great action, gadgets and a lot of humor.",Dr. No
15,rmax304823,The Wanton Seed.,6,6 February 2009,"What an innovation this was in 1962. Everyone seemed to be reading Ian Fleming. President Kennedy got a kick out of them. And now, finally, the movie. It was fresh -- amusing and thrilling. That guitar theme alone received wild applause at college theaters. And Sean Connery! The perfect James Bond, an ex body builder, tall, masculine, dark, dapper, finicky, and cartoonishly handsome. The plot too. Intrigue, colorful location shooting, licensed to kill, a villain whose evil whose quality matches that of Bond's efficiency, and Ursula Andress in what was then considered a daring bikini.There had never been a hero like Bond. For most of the audience it was their first sight of martial arts. At the time, martial arts didn't even have exotic names like Dai Gwan Do or Karel Maga or Karate or Moo Goo Gai Pan. They all went under the generic name of Jujitsu or Judo. And no hero had ever made such sly wisecracks before killing an unarmed enemy or having sex. And no one on the screen, certainly no government operative or action figure, had ever given a damn whether his martinis were shaken or stirred.Connery as Bond rarely laughs and only smiles when he believes it will be to his sexual advantage to do so. He's charming but determined. He catches a beautiful spy in his room, woos her, and they make love. Afterward he feels like going out for Italian because he feels romantic, so he makes a call ostensibly for a cab. The beautiful babe throws herself on him, he embraces her and rolls her over for a second turn, but as he does it he glances at his watch. Then they dress, he escorts her outside where a police car is waiting, snaps out, ""Arrest her,"" and strides off to discharge more of the responsibilities associated with his Calvinistic calling. It was all so new, so full of fey charm.I watched it again tonight and, aside from Connery's presence, found it dull, or maybe my sensibilities had dulled over the years. The franchise is still slogging along. There have been half a dozen Bonds, some of them ludicrous, and all the films seem to be more expensive, more f/x-ridden, more spectacular, and duller than the ones before.They've passed into history, except that, as in any ill thought-out thriller, the dead body keeps springing back to life. The villains have come to occupy a minor place in our vernacular culture, like half-remembered jingles or slogans for TV commercials. Let's see. There's Odd Job. Then there's the guy with the steel teeth from ""Moonraker."" Then Robert Shaw. He wasn't the guy with the steel teeth, was he? No, not him. They get mixed up with the relentless march of the years and the Bond movies.As for Sean Connery, he happily proved to be more than just James Bond. With those crazily cocked eyebrows, he went on to a splendid career, perhaps the most popular actor never to have uttered a believable word on the screen. His features, especially those brows and that wry smile, kept hinting that he wasn't taking himself or his role seriously. It worked just fine.This was the first of a long, long list. I don't know why they keep coming. I imagine it must be that the first episodes of the series are now so ancient that a new generation rediscovers Bond every ten years or so. It's like an open-ended Ponzi scheme.Enjoy it if you can.",Dr. No
16,Tweekums,Introducing James Bond,8,23 August 2011,This film sees James Bond's proper introduction to the big screen; before Bond meant exotic gadgets and a succession of spectacular stunts. When contact is lost with an agent in Jamaica Bond is dispatched to find out if there is any connection between his disappearance and a CIA theory that somebody in Jamaica is trying to 'topple' rockets being launched from Cape Canaveral. Bond doesn't have to wait long before his life is threatened and the danger only increases when he starts to investigate the island of Crab Key and its mysterious owner; Dr. No. As one would expect from a Bond film Bond ends up with a succession of beautiful women including one of the best known of all the 'Bond Girls'; Honey Ryder who emerges from the sea in one of the most famous film scenes.While this isn't the best Bond film it is a must see for fans of the series as it introduces the character. Fans of Ian Fleming's books will also be pleased as it follows the original story much more closely than most of the series. Sean Connery quickly makes the role his own and remains the iconic Bond to this day. Ursula Andress isn't bad as Honey Ryder and Joseph Wiseman is suitably menacing as Dr. No. This film may lack the spectacular stunts of later outings but it has plenty of tense scenes and like all great villains Dr. No has a subterranean lair from which to launch his nefarious schemes.,Dr. No

Unforgettable musical score with immortal and catching leitmotif by Monty Norman and John Barry . It's brimming with colorful and fascinating cinematography by cameraman Ted Moore . Evocative photography , much of the film was shot on location , with only a bare minimum of back projection used ; something quite unusual for a film of 1962 . The motion picture was well directed by Terence Young and followed by ¨From Russia with love¨ whose budget was $2,000,000 , double that of ¨Doctor No¨ . Young was author of three best James Bond films : ¨Dr No¨ , ¨Thunderball¨ and ¨From Russia with love¨ and directed to Audrey Hepburn in a good thriller titled ¨Wait until dark¨ and a failed film titled ¨Bloodline¨.",Dr. No
18,BA_Harrison,A solid start for Bond.,7,27 May 2012,"I've been a Bond fan nearly all my life, but being born in '68 I didn't get going until after Connery had hung up his Walther PPK (not counting Never Say Never Again). The quips, crazy stunts and high-tech gadgetry of the Roger Moore movies were what I grew up watching; in comparison, Connery's earlier films seemed like a lot less fun and, a few drunken viewings on Christmas Day notwithstanding, they've remained unseen by me. Until now...At last, I've decided to catch up on the Bond films that have previously escaped my attention—starting with the very first in the series, Dr. No, which might not boast the same production values, level of escapism or explosive action as Moore's Bond escapades, but which still proves to be a more than reasonable opening assignment for the agent, putting into place many of the elements that would become standard for the series.Dr. No starts with what can only be described as very groovy titles, bold multi-coloured 60s graphics which transform into gyrating figures backed by a bongotastic calypso beat, before the silhouettes of three blind men take us into the movie proper. The story starts in Jamaica, with these three men, who are not as blind as they pretend to be, assassinating a secret agent and his secretary. The murdered spy had been on an assignment investigating the sabotage of US rocket launches, and Bond is sent to the Caribbean to find out who was responsible and why.Connery's being Scottish has always made it difficult for me to accept him in the role of Bond (moreso than Lazenby, Dalton and Brosnan, whose accents were less obvious), and the size of his eyebrows are a little off-putting, but I have to admit that he's actually pretty good in the role; whether getting into a fist fight with a bad guy or a clinch with a scantily clad babe, he is certainly convincing as a deadly, womanising super spy (as much as I enjoy the impossibly suave and unflappable style of Moore, Connery's macho style is more believable).And although there is none of Moore's wry innuendo and sexist remarks to lighten the mood, the film does provide some unintentional laughs: the 'dragon' that scares the superstitious locals could never be perceived as anything other than an armoured vehicle (try not to giggle when Ursula Andress points out tyre tracks and calls them dragon footprints); the atomic power plant on Dr. No's island is straight out of Austin Powers, particularly the perilous walkway over the bubbling liquid, the extra large red blinking light, and the handy over-sized danger-level indicator (perfect for those intending to blow the place up); and the bright red T-shirt worn by Bond's pal Quarrel (John Kitzmiller) screams out 'I'm over here, please kill me!'.",Dr. No
19,moonspinner55,"The cinematic debut of James Bond...sleek and stylized, if not terribly exciting",6,23 July 2010,"Ian Fleming's Secret Intelligence Agent James Bond debuts on the big screen with a relative absence of high-tech gadgetry--and yet with enough dangerous distractions and comely females to hold the attention of non-Bond addicts. After a British Intelligence Officer is murdered in Jamaica by the Three Blind Mice assassination team, 007 aids the CIA to thwart SPECTRE agents from interfering with rocket launches at Cape Canaveral using an atomic-powered radio beam. Relatively low-budget Bond outing set the foundation for what soon emerged as one of the most profitable franchises in movie history. ""Dr. No"" features some tightly-directed physical action, eye-popping locales and production design, and of course Sean Connery in the lead (coolly confident and suave, if a bit green). If it doesn't live up to the thrills we've now come to expect, it entertains in its own unassuming way. Consider this Exhibit A. **1/2 from ****",Dr. No

Mom noticed there wasn't much action compared to subsequent ones and I thought it was slow the first time I saw this. But it's still pretty exciting to watch and how awesome to see the first time that gun barrel animation that always begins the JB movies is first presented as well as the first time that theme plays, the first time Sean Connery says ""Bond, James Bond"", and the first time we also meet M and Miss Moneypenny! Add in Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder, Joseph Wiseman as the first villain as referred to by the title, and Jack Lord (pre-original ""Hawaii Five-O"") as the first of several Felix Leiters and you've got a treat of the initial entry in the James Bond series! So, yes, that's a recommendation.",Dr. No
21,BandSAboutMovies,Bond begins,5,1 April 2020,"Two men wanted the rights to the James Bond novels: Harry Saltzman and Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli. Broccoli wanted to make the films more than Saltzman and while they couldn't agree on a sale, they would agree to make the films together.The problem? Many studios felt that the Bond books were too British and too sexual, but United Artists agreed to release their movie, giving it a low budget. As a result, Saltzman and Broccoli created two companies: rightsholding firm Danjaq and Eon Productions, which would actually produce the movies. Their partnership would last until 1975's The Man With the Golden Gun.Speaking of bad feelings, the pair wanted to make Thunderball the first Bond film. However, there was an ongoing legal issue between the writer of a screenplay for the film, Kevin McClory, and the book's author Ian Fleming. Keep this in mind as our Bond Month continues, as while it's a footnote now, it becomes a major issue later.The team behind the film decided that Dr. No, the second Bond book, would be the first movie. It made sense - the space race was on.But first, they needed a director. Several - Guy Green, Val Guest, Guy Hamilton and Ken Hughes - turned down the project before Terence Young came on board. The future director of Inchon and The Klansman realized that in order for the sex and violence of the film to be palatable to a mass audience - and pass the censors - a sense of humor was necessary.United Artists only gave a million dollars to get the film made, which necessitated plenty of creativity to get all of the bases and special effects into the film.While original writers Richard Maibaum and Wolf Mankowitz wrote a script that was nowhere near Ian Fleming's novel - they made Dr. No a monkey - the second draft was better, especially when script doctors Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather entered the project.So after all that - there was a very important question: who would be James Bond?Cary Grant was the first choice, but he'd only commit to one movie. Richard Johnson - who would be in plenty of spy movies soon enough - was also considered, as was Parick McGoohan thanks to his performance as Danger Man. Other names bandied about were David Niven (he'd play Bond in 1967's Casino Royale), Roger Moore (more on him all month long), Stanely Baker, Rex Harrison, James Mason, Steve Reeves and Richard Todd.There was even a contest to find who Bond would be. A model named Peter Anthony won, but wasn't up to the task.Enter Sean Connery, who may have showed up rumpled and unshaved to his interview, but had the right attitude. Director Young would take it upon himself to make Connery into Bond, sending him to his tailor and hairdresser before giving him a crash course in style, manners and the high life.The visual look of Bond - the stylized title opening, the gun barrel beginning - all start here. It's a modest film with much bigger goals. This was world-building and sequel making before many even considered what that meant.The team behind the film also realized that marketing was essential to the film's success - particularly in America. By late 1961, United Artists sent a boxed set of the books to newspapers, as well as a book explaining the character and, perhaps most importantly, a glamour shot of first Bond girl Ursula Andress.They also made merchandising deals with alcohol, tobacco, automobile and men's fashion companies, using Fleming's name and the success of the books to sell the character. And because sex sells, the posters featured Connery surrounded by gorgeous - and near-nude - women.The results were pretty much an instant success. The films would become a series that nearly 25% of the world's population has seen. The books became even bigger sellers. And the bikini - which Andress wore so famously - became the swimwear of choice for young women.James Bond had arrived.Bond has been called in to learn more about the disappearance of MI6 Jamaican station chief John Strangways and his assistant Mary Trueblood. Signal jamming of Cape Canaveral, the CIA (say hello to Jack Lord as Felix Leiter in the only time he'd play the role) and a bevy of assassins are soon involved.The series stands out as something different right away, as after Bond escapes a tarantula death trap, he captures, interrogates and cold-bloodedly kills Dr. No's associate Professor R.J. Dent (Anthony Dawson, who would return as Blofeld in From Russia With Love and Thunderball).CIA agent Quarrel and Bond make it to the island of Dr. No, which is said to be guarded by a dragon - which is actually a flamethrowing tank. Bond meets Honey West (Andress) and after a battle that takes the life of Quarrel, he and West are taken to meet Dr. No.As played by Joseph Wiseman (Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Jaguar Lives!), Dr. Julius No is a Chinese-German supercriminal in the employ of SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion). Due to radiation poisoning, he's lost both his hands and has replaced them with robotic versions. He wants Bond to join SPECTRE and help him disrupt an American space launch, but you know exactly what happens next: Bond escapes the last death trap and kills just about everybody so that the free world can remain safe.Dr. No also sets up Bond's MI6 team of Miss Moneypenny and Q. Lois Maxwell would play the former role for the first fourteen movies, while Peter Burton would only play Q for this first movie.Eunice Gayson (The Revenge of Frankenstein) plays Bond's girlfriend Sylvia Trench, who was supposed to have a much larger role in the films. She was considered lucky by director Young, who cast her.After seeing the movie for the first time, Ian Fleming summed it up quickly and candidly: ""Dreadful. Simply dreadful.""Luckily, the rest of the world did not agree.",Dr. No

Now they can both pay for their mistake.",8,11 April 2012,"Dr. No is directed by Terence Young and co-adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood & Berkely Mather from the novel of the same name written by Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Joseph Wiseman, Ursula Andress, Jack Lord & John Kitzmiller. Music is by Monty Norman and cinematography by Ted Moore.And so it all began here, what was until Harry Potter arrived on the scene, the most successful film franchise in history. James Bond, a name that would become synonymous with suave spies, deranged villains, beautiful women, exotic locations, gadgets, cars and sex. Ian Fleming's James Bond novels were big come the end of 1961, yet producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman met some resistance from studios. It was never plain sailing, even after release the film garnered mixed reviews, but word of mouth and condemnation by the Vatican and the Kremlin propelled it to being one of the surprise hits of 62/63. At the box office it made £60 million Worldwide, this after being made on a budget of only £1 million.Plot basically sees Connery's Bond flying out to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of agent Strangways (Timothy Moxon). Once there he finds a case of murder is to be investigated and evidence points to the mysterious Dr. No (Wiseman), who resides on Crab Quay island, a place feared by the superstitious locals. Bond must keep his wits about him as he gets closer to the truth, for there are many obstacles in his way and not everyone can be trusted. Cue the suave and athletic Mr. Bond getting involved with lovely ladies, dicing with death, making friends, making enemies and just generally being an all round awesome anti-hero.SPECTRE: Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion.There are a number of changes from the book and some censor appeasement was required to get the film a certificate enabling youngsters to see the film with an adult. What Dr. No rounds out as is a jolly good spy/action movie yarn. Some of the hints are there for what would make Bond such a profitable and well loved franchise, but there's no sign of the gadgetry, tricks and japes that would fill out so many of the titles that followed Dr. No. Here Bond is just armed with his Walter PPK 7.65MM pistol, Sunbeam Alpine car and his bravado and nouse.Some future stalwart characters are given modest introductions (M, Felix Leiter, Moneypenny) and Ursula Andress sets the marker for all future Bond girls to follow. Ted Moore's capturing of the Jamaica location is sumptuous, something that really comes to the fore on the remastered DVD edition of the film. Connery is supremely cool and fearless, the theme tune and gun barrel opening are already in place, and Terence Young, who directs three of the first four Bond movies, keeps it zippy and suspenseful when story gathers up a flame throwing tank, car chases, fights and a quite brilliant tarantula sequence.Quite a debut, uneven at times as it begins to find its feet, but even if it wasn't the first James Bond movie it would hold up as an entertaining bit of secret agent shenanigans. 7.5/10",Dr. No
25,Theo Robertson,If Only All Bond Films Were This Good,7,8 December 2002,"Watching DR NO after all these years the first thing to strike me is how gritty it all is . The villains are cruel and not below shooting unarmed women in the back so who better to take them on than an equally cold hearted killer namely James Bond 007 . Bond must have shocked cinema audiences in the 1960s , no one described as a good guy in pre Bond cinema ever shot one of the bad guys in the back no matter what the provocation . John Wayne didn`t do it and neither did Errol Flynn but here we see Sean Connery doing it even though he didn`t have to .And I`m making no distinction between Sean Connery and the character he plays , James Bond is Sean Connery . Try saying "" James Bond "" out loud . Done it ? Notice the slightly slurred Scottish brogue . Try it again . See it`s impossible not to say "" Bond. Jamesh Bond "" Let`s not forget Connery made Bond a cultural icon and Connery was at one point the world`s most famous and highest paid movie star .Not bad for a man who started off life in an Edinburgh tenement and whose first paid job was as a milk boy
One final thing I noticed about DR N0 is how tightly written and paced it is. Plot point is followed by murder attempt followed by plot point followed by murder attempt followed by plot point. At no time does any of this seem forced and at no time do we see 15-20 minutes padded out with a ridculous stunt sequence . If only all Bond films were as good as this or GOLDFINGER",Dr. No
26,Scarecrow-88,Dr. No,8,29 March 2015,"On Crab Key, former Tong underlord, Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman in Chinaman makeup) fled with millions of his Chinese gang's loot, offering his ""scientific services"" to countries in the East and West, with no takers wanting any involvement with his kind of sociopathic genius. Enter 007, special agent for Her Majesty's Secret Service, James Bond (Sean Connery, suave and studly). He is investigating the murder of a spy, and during this encounters peril thanks to where it leadsDr. No. Dr. No has this hidden lair where he has been conducting radioactive experiments, and Bond will interfere with his efforts. Adventure in Jamaican locales certainly has its value, as does Ursula Andress as the very first Bond beauty emerging from the ocean with sea shells much to Bond's (and our) delight. Plenty of threats on Bond's life he must usurp and undermine such as agents for S.P.E.C.T.R.E constantly trying to use methods of execution (venomous spider, scientist working in concert with Dr. No who tries to shoot a supposedly sleeping Bond, a chauffeur attempting to drive him into the danger zone, guards on Crab Key driving a machine dressed as a dragon with a blow torch, etc.) to bump him off. The meeting between Bond and Dr. No comes right at the very end, and their fight as the British Secret Agent foils their plans by disrupting the radioactivity disguised in a suit like the other scientists working for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. could have been a bit more worthwhile, but this is all about the accumulation of developments instead of just the dénouement. I have always felt Dr. No is more of a starting place that leads to better things than quintessential Bond. It has always been considered one of the best of the Connery Bonds, but I think the next one, From Russia with Love is superior in every way except perhaps its Bond girl. Still, Connery as the debonair, womanizing, and brilliant agent with tons of charisma and movie star power to spare is what truly sets Dr. No on a successful course from beginning to end. He does everything, from seducing any lovely woman that comes in his orbit, to killing somebody with gun or knife if need be, with style and cool. The whole appeal to me is seeing Bond escape one sticky situation after another using his cunning, smarts, and instincts. Much like Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (the show), a convenient access tunnel (with a bit of a shock that reels Bond a bit before he uses his shoes as a countermeasure) allows Bond to escape a prison and find his way into the power room where Dr. No conducts his radioactive shenanigans. As all Bond movies tend to feature, Dr. No explains his world domination motive and inexplicably allows the agent to live over and over when the smarter option would have been to kill him immediately. As often was the case, not doing so means that Bond will defeat them in the end.",Dr. No
27,Hey_Sweden,A smashing film debut for 007.,8,31 December 2014,"Top British secret agent James Bond (Sean Connery) is assigned to a case in Jamaica: find out what happened to a man named Strangways (Tim Moxon), and determine what is interfering with America's space program and their rocket launches. He makes the acquaintance of fisherman Quarrel (John Kitzmiller) and easygoing CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) who assist him in his searches, and must dodge a trio of assassins known as The Three Blind Mice. Eventually, he finds his quarry, the diabolical title character, played by Joseph Wiseman.As directed by Terence Young, who went on to guide ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Thunderball"", ""Dr. No"" is simply a good, solid spy adventure. It doesn't go about trying to dazzle us with intense action set pieces, but merely tells an engaging Ian Fleming story. Bonds' entrance into the tale is simply perfect, and the movie wonderfully sets up some of the familiar characters like M (Bernard Lee) and Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell). Right from the start, Bond was a cool and unflappable man, never panicking in the face of danger, and is of course very smooth with the ladies. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder is a classic Bond girl, lovely to look at and given her own memorable introduction.The Bond series wouldn't quite hit its stride until ""Goldfinger"", so it's good that this was enough of a success to warrant further productions. Viewers can also note that this was before the franchise would give us the iconic Aston Martin car or any of the ingenious gadgets that Q would devise. Here, he isn't even addressed as Q, but as Major Boothroyd (here played by Peter Burton).Connery exudes plenty of charisma and self assurance, and works well with such players as Kitzmiller and Lord. Wiseman is terrific as the master villain, making the most out of fairly limited screen time (we don't see him until over 84 minutes into the movie). The climax does feel a little rushed, but that doesn't detract from the entertainment value. That wonderful music, Ken Adams' well designed sets, and the location work all combine to make this quite a pleasure to watch.Eight out of 10.",Dr. No

There are the usual bad guys who want to destroy a rocket launch and it's up to Bond to thwart their plans.Unlike so many other Bond adventures, DR. NO moves swiftly forward without the plot ever getting too complicated--as it does in many a spy story by Ian Fleming and others. The simplistic approach lets the viewer enjoy the interaction between some believable characters for a change. ANTHONY DAWSON is excellent as one of Dr. No's henchmen asked to kill Bond with a tarantula. After the failed mission, Bond is able to pay Dr. No an unexpected visit.There's never any doubt that Connery and Andress will wind up together for a happy finale, but the suspense all the way through is well maintained under Terence Young's crisp direction.

The Most Enduring and Continuously Flowing Film Franchise in History. It Can Not be Emphasised Enough about this Movie's, at the Time, Newness. The Sex, Violence, and Charm of the Formula was as Influential and Impressionable as Anything Put on Film. Movies would Never be the Same.This Embryonic Film and the James Bond Character was a Diamond in the Rough. It would be Cut and Polished in the Next Two Films, but Whatever Shortcomings and Flaws there are in this One, it is Overwhelmed by the Bond/Dr. No Characters and the Tone. New Roads were being Paved with a Very Limited Budget and an Unproven Theme. The Movie Hits a Few Potholes with its Clunky Dragon and Less than Fulfilling Last 10 Minutes, but all of this is Mostly Due to Budget Restraints.The Bond Girls (Ursula Andress' Entrance is Legendary), the Debonair Legal Assassin from Britain with a Licence to Kill, and the CIA/MI6 Evil Counterpart S.P.E.C.T.R.E., are to this Day, Still Flickering about on Movie and TV Screens in Various but not that much Different Form. This Movie is not Only a Classic, but is Cool and has Class.",Dr. No
31,CinemaSerf,Dr. not quite.,7,2 January 2020,"This first cinema outing for James Bond is actually quite lucky it managed to spawn any sequels at all... Sean Connery is suave and debonair as the British Secret Agent dispatched to Jamaica to investigate a mysterious murder with potentially far more serious repercussions. Ursula Andress is great as the first ""Bond girl"" but the film itself is a bit short on substance. It's pretty light on action, the script a little too innuendo-ridden and Dr. No hardly features at all - when he does he hardly sets your teeth a-chattering with fear. It has no theme song, either.... It's passes the time OK, but not the best.",Dr. No
32,utgard14,"""Tell me, does the toppling of American missiles really compensate for having no hands?""",8,29 August 2014,"British secret agent James Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow agent. The trail leads him to Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), a villain with metal hands who is disrupting American rocket launches for his own purposes.The first James Bond film is an exciting start to the long-running franchise. It stars the best Bond, Sean Connery, and features one of the more memorable Bond girls, Honey Ryder (played by sexy Ursula Andress). Wiseman's Dr. No is a fun villain to start things off with. His verbal sparring with Bond is one of the film's highlights. It's a different kind of Bond movie compared to most. The gadgets and fantastic set-pieces aren't there. The double entendres and one-liners ARE there, though not quite as many as later movies have. It's a fine script, though, and Connery has many great lines. It's also different in that Bond shoots a man in cold blood in this one. Is it my favorite Bond movie? No, but it's a really good one. Intelligent, sexy, fun with colorful characters. Terrific entertainment that has aged very well.",Dr. No
33,lastliberal,"Tell me Miss Trench, do you play any other games?",8,20 May 2007,"I went back to revisit this film that started all the Bond nonsense. It doesn't age well and the performances seemed a little silly, but I am judging it in it's time when I give it a rating.One of the funniest things about this film is that it is considered an ""action film."" In fact, it won an award for best action film of 1964 from some group. Now, how anyone can consider this film to be in the class of John Wayne's McClintock or Steve McQueen's The Great Escape is beyond my understanding. There was so little action in this film, that it should be categorized as a dramedy. A little fisticuffs here and there, and some ridiculous moves, was just about it. That's the comedy part. Most of the film involves talking, and not good dialog at that.But, we are introduced to Sean Connery as Bond, James Bond and SPECTRE, and the whole gang. We get to enjoy Ursula Andress, who won the only award of her career for Most Promising Newcomer for her first English-language film. They didn't have very high standards evidently as all she did in the film was walk around half dressed. Even her dialog was dubbed.Connery would half to do until Brosnan came along to make Bond the real star that he is, however, there are some that are still strangely attracted to this hairy character.",Dr. No
34,zardoz-13,James Bond Begins . . . And What A Beginning!,8,5 March 2009,"The first entry in the James Bond franchise, Terence Young's ""Dr. No,"" has a rough hewn urgency about it not only in Young's lean, muscular helming of the exotic, larger-than-life, derring-do hijinks in the Caribbean but also in Sean Connery's snappy, no-nonsense performance. Young never lets the momentum lapse in this straightforward, high-tech thriller. The 1958 Ian Fleming novel concerned super villain Dr. No's dastardly efforts to sabotage American missile tests. The Richard Miabaum, Berkeley Mather, and Joanna Harwood screenplay doesn't depart drastically from Fleming's source material. Six differences, however, crop up. First, Dr. No is tampering with NASA's Mercury project by toppling, i.e., throwing the gyroscopic controls of a guided missile off-balance, rather than just interfering with a generic missile launch. Second, Bond battled a squid at Dr. No's island fortress in the novel, but he doesn't tangle with any sea beasts in the film. Third, a centipede crawled over Bond's body in the novel, whereas a tarantula creeps across him in the movie. Fourth, Dr. No drowns in a pool of radioactive coolant pool rather than dies in a pile of guano. Fifth, in the book, Dr. No has such anatomical peculiarities as his heart on the wrong side, enabling him to survive an assassination attempt by rival fractions. Sixth, Leiter isn't in the novel.Unlike later 007 adventures, ""Dr. No"" lacks a pre-credit sequence, but the film does open with the traditional gun barrel. The man in the gun barrel, however, is not Sean Connery, but stunt man Bob Simmons. Simmons continued to appear in the gun barrel until ""Thunderball"" when producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli adopted the widescreen format. The film does a credible job of intertwining exposition with action so that the action never stalls. Incidentally, the Bond producers called on another actress to dub Ursula Andress's voice. Saltzman and Broccoli were definitely ambitious with their meager million dollar budget. Ken Adam's setseven on this threadbare budgetremain larger-than-life, especially the atmospheric room where Professor Dent collects the spider. Bond's journey through the air ducts on Dr. No's island is appropriately menacing, too. He gets drenched, shocked, and steamed. The spider in his bed is a suspenseful touch, despite the obvious Plexiglas between Connery and the arachnid. Lenser Ted Moore photography is crisp and captures the scenery of Jamaica.John Strangways (Tim Moxon) leaves his bridge game at his club to transmit his daily message to London. Before he can leave the parking lot, the three blind black beggars pour lead into him with their silenced automatic pistols. They shoot him at least five times and sling his body in a hearse. Later, they show up at his office and murder his secretary after she has opened the frequency to send a message to London. The communications department makes a note of the failure of Jamaica to transmit anything but a signal and passes the information along to their superiors. The chief of British MI-7, M (Bernard Lee), dispatches his top field agent, James Bond (Sean Connery), to Jamaica to investigate the deaths of these two employees. Similarly, ""Live and Let Die"" opened with the deaths of three British agents in or near the Caribbean and M sent Bond out to check up on them. No sooner does Bond arrive in Jamaica than he attracts attention from a photographer and finds a chauffeur with a car awaiting him. Bond checks with Government House and learns that the authorities did not send the chauffeur, so our hero plays along until he exposes the driver. At the same time, Bond discovers that he is being followed and tells the chauffeur to lose their pursuers.Eventually, Bond meets CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) who has been assigned to the case. NASA plans to launch another rocket and our heroes must take care of Dr. No. Bond uncovers a leak in Government House in the pretty form of a secretary, Miss Taro. He has a date with her, inevitable off-screen sex, and then exposes her as a traitor and has the authorities arrest her. Professor Dent (Anthony Dawson) who was playing bridge with Strangways lies to Bond about rock samples that Strangways found on Dr. No's island. The rocks are contaminated with radioactive material. Miss Taro and Dent conspire to kill 007, but he thwarts their plans.One of the scenes that United Artists objected to at first involved Bond's killing of Professor Dent in Miss Taro's bungalow. Professor Dent emptied his Smith & Wesson into what he believed was Bond asleep in Miss Taro's bed, only to discover 007 sitting on the blind side of the door with his own gun aimed at Dent. During Bond's brief but pointless interrogation of Dent, the evil professor exploits an opportunity to recover his weapon when Bond looks away for a moment. Dent shoots but his gun clicks on empty. ""That's a Smith & Wesson,"" Bond reminds him, ""and you've had your six."" Bond asks him who he works for and then shoots him dead. United Artists were initially horrified because it looked like murder, but the Bond producers persuaded them to allow the scene to stay as it was.Of course, the problem with all Bond movies is that 007 cannot die. The strength or weakness of this franchise lays in those cliffhanger situations and how closely the villains come to killing Bond. Further, the hero must work to triumph over his adversaries and the ease with which the hero succeeds reflects the film's strength.Joseph Wiseman does a splendid job as the dispassionate Dr. No. who resembles Fu Manchu. He works for SPECTRE and despises all governments. Bond and he struggle in the end in his command center after 007 overheats the radioactive core. Ursula Andress looks beautiful in her two-piece bathing suit when she walks up onto the beach and that in itself proves sufficient. ""Dr. No"" qualified as a modest start for a great franchise.",Dr. No
35,oscaralbert,If DR. NO's pops was German . . .,8,25 March 2014,". . . shouldn't he have dubbed himself ""Dr. Nein""? And since SPECTRE is an acronym for organizational gobbledygook, why didn't the bad guys simplify it to T-REX (for Terrorism, Revenge & EXtortion)? Semantics aside, DR. NO--as Brit spy character James Bond's theatrical film debut--is a much stronger effort than its clumsy sequel, FROM RUSS!A WITH LOVE. Having BOTH the evil SPECTRE and the venal SMERSH in the second film is a bit too much. Plus the sophomoric RUSS!A has less compelling chase scenes, much lower stakes (a silly decoder, in contrast to DR. NO's crushing of the U.S. space program), and NO martinis for James (shaken, or otherwise). In DR. NO, an island blows up. In the low-budget follow-up, a model helicopter explodes. Ursula Andress has to get totally full-frontal for radioactive decontamination purposes in DR. NO. The RUSS!A chicks are virtually parka-covered, in comparison to Ms. Undress. Bottom line: ""Yes"" on NO; ""nyet"" on RUSS!A.",Dr. No
36,view_and_review,Can We Bring Bonds Down to Earth?,6,12 January 2019,James Bonds was the first of the suave debonair spies. He was just as adept at conquering women as he was his foes. He was the man all other men wanted to be like. I think that's why I'm not that big of a fan. He's too much of a fantasy.While mere mortals suffer rejection after rejection from every type of woman and others spare themselves the rejections by refusing to even approach the opposite sex-007 doesn't even have to exert the least bit of energy.While men of the human race have to train their bodies and hone their fighting and shooting skills to become deadly with a gun and their hands-Bonds seems to have acquired these skills through osmosis.The movie itself offered some intrigue with the Hitchcockian mystery and the grand plot that needed to be foiled. I just couldn't get past the supernatural being they put on screen masquerading as a man and blatantly presenting this false image of manhood. Maybe I'm just a product of my age with a lack of appreciation of 1960's heroes but I can't help it. Bring Bonds down to earth and then perhaps I can hold him in greater esteem.,Dr. No
37,neil-476,Still great,10,21 September 2009,"The Bond franchise leaps onto the big screen, fully grown, in what is still one of the top five Bond films.Connery endows Bond with a gritty hardness unmatched until Craig, and I'm told he was pretty sexy, too. And if he's not your particular persuasion, the young Ursula Andress in that iconic bikini probably is.The film is a decent adaptation of what is probably Fleming's most accessible Band novel (although, as mass market fodder, all were easy reads), albeit the tunnel escape, a showcase set piece in the book, is necessarily compacted here.The action is great. The music hasn't quite got there yet. The locations are colourful and exotic. The quips haven't overpowered the dialogue in general. The clothes are firmly stuck in a time warp, of course, but that really doesn't matter.This is a classic movie which still holds up well, according to present day standards, nearly 50 years later.",Dr. No
38,Uriah43,One of the Best James Bond Films,8,27 September 2012,"The first, and one of the best, James Bond films in which a British intelligence outpost in Jamaica mysteriously goes off-line and James Bond (played by Sean Connery) is sent from London to investigate. When he arrives in Kingston he follows several leads that eventually bring him face to face with a Chinese scientist by the name of ""Doctor No"" (Joseph Wiseman) who intends to disrupt the United States space program. Prior to that however, he encounters several attempts to permanently end his mission. He also gets to make the acquaintance of several beautiful women: ""Sylvia Trench"" (Eunice Grayson), ""Miss Taro"" (Zena Marshall) and ""Honey Ryder"" (Ursula Andress). Of the three, Ursula Andress attracted the most attention and she ranks highly in popular opinion as one of the best ""Bond girls"" throughout the film's history. Other aspects of this film include the introduction of C.I.A. operative ""Felix Leiter"" (Jack Lord), ""Miss Moneypenny"" (Lois Maxwell) and ""M"" (played by Bernard Lee). Likewise it provides us with the reason James Bond carries his famous Walter PPK instead of a Beretta. Although it lacks the usual ""gizmos"" featured in most of the sequels it makes up for it with good acting on the part of several characters. To this day many people believe Sean Connery was the best actor to play the James Bond role and ""Dr. No"" was certainly one of his best movies in that regard. Additionally, even though Zena Marshall is often overlooked (because she shared the screen with the beautiful Ursula Andress) I thought her performance as the ""bad girl"" who tries to keep James Bond ""occupied"" was very enjoyable. Overall, this is a very good movie that still manages to endure the test of time after all these years.",Dr. No

In the early 2000's,my last major video purchases was buying 007 tapes from Woolworths which had a cool picture made by lining all the spines up.

Terence Young, cinematographer Ted Moore and editor Peter Hunt deck the negative vibes and deliver a blazing big screen (Bond first appeared in the 1954 Climax! Episode/adaptation of Casino Royale) slice of Euro Spy thrills, establishing motifs which still continue in Bond. The first flick shot in Jamaica,Young & Moore create an atmosphere of glamour in long tracking shots of Bond spying on the locals, and panning shots following 007 gain info from the locals in cramped bars (built a size too small,in order to make Bond look more imposing.) Building anticipation to Bond's first appearance for the opening 7 minutes, Peter Hunt's stylised ""Crash Cutting"" editing perfectly matches up with Young's action set-pieces, with the missing/cut frames making the punches/ kicks land with a thump,and Young unveiling Dr. No's evil lair as a gloriously funky creation.Whilst containing a number of catchphrases,Richard Maibaum/Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather's adaptation is a refreshingly low-key affair, with 007 spending most of the film trying to charm and punch info from locals on the Fu Manchu-inspired Dr.No. Along with Bond and Ryder swimming to the lair, the writers wonderfully make local Quarrel (a very good John Kitzmiller) be an equal to Bond,in Quarrel's case using local knowledge to unmask the baddie. Dubbed by Nikki Van der Zyl, Ursula Andress makes the first Bond Girl sing, with a sizzling, alluring presence as Ryder, whilst Sir Sean marks his first mission with a fantastic ease of balancing off the cuff one-liners with tough combat fights,as 007 goes in search of Dr.No.",Dr. No

Director Terence Young succeeds in creating suspense as well as unusual gadgets that assist Bond in his quest. The island for which Dr. No dwells contains a fortress where Bond is placed under seeming pleasure yet dire torture.

Jack Lord is on hand as a CIA agent and Ursula Andress as a shell diverBased on Ian Fleming's 1958 novel, ""Dr. No"" (1962) was the beginning of the never-ending James Bond franchise and features the common staples: The catchy James Bond theme, the opening gun barrel sequence, the suave protagonist, gorgeous women, ritzy casino gambling, exotic locales, spy devices, action thrills, shaken-not-stirred drinks and a megalomaniac villain.While this one's not as ridiculous with the gadgets or action as later installments, somehow Bond's relatively mundane but increasingly dangerous investigation on Jamaica is compelling as it progresses to the lair of the titular antagonist. It's no wonder that it was a hit and sparked the espionage hysteria of the '60s.Andress stands out on the feminine front, but there's also Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro, both just as beautiful in their own way.The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Jamaica and Pinewood Studios & London, England.GRADE: A-",Dr. No

No  Thank you Doctor No.  This film is the first of all the Bond films it has a different beginning than the other films.  There was no Q in this one, or his gagets, along with the dramatic action scenes.  This is not a bad first time out considering the low budget in this film; compare it to 71's diamonds are forever and one will see how the budget grew.  You can tell that Ian Fleming loves the islands, and did some spying himself when they made this film.  This would have been another b movie if it was not for Sean Connery, whose humor, and sarcasm made this film memorable; I also liked the Hawaii Five O guys role in the film.

46,deloudelouvain,Didn't age that well but still good enough.,5,21 March 2021,"I decided to watch and/or rewatch all the James Bond movies ever made and starting with the first one seemed only logical. I have to take in consideration it was made in 1962, not exactly the period where acting was at its best, and it shows. Not all the actors are top, with a lot of overacting which seems normal for that time. When you can see that an actor is acting he's actually not a good actor. Only when it all seems natural an actor is good. In Dr. No you have several actors (Ursula Andrews for instance) that are just overacting and that's just not a good thing. In my opinion Dr. No didn't age very well. I still enjoy it though, certainly because it's with Sean Connery, the first James Bond (and in my opinion the only real one). The story is a bit simple, there aren't the usual gadgets yet, it all looks like a tryout for later. I won't say it's a bad movie, certainly not for that time, but compared to what we get now there's just no comparison possible. Some scenes looked really fake but I guess for that time it's passable.

But it does have great sets, exotic locale and it has Connery, bringing the cold-blooded killer in lieu of the British accent.

48,SimonJack,Introducing James Bond,7,23 August 2017,"""Dr. No"" is the first of what would become more than two dozen movies about British Secret Agent 007, James Bond. The special agent of Britain's MI-6 is the creation of Ian Fleming. Fleming was a journalist for Reuters and when World War II broke out, he was recruited for Britain's Naval Intelligence. After the war, he managed a newspaper office and took up writing his spy novels. He introduced the world to his famous James Bond in his first novel, Casino Royale in April 1953.The Bond movie series has stretched over more than 50 years, as of the date of the last movie, ""Spectre"" in 2015. Half a dozen different actors have played Bond, but Sean Connery established his identity from the start. I haven't read any of Fleming's novels about Bond, nor books by authors who have continued the Bond series. But, It's interesting to note that each subsequent movie seems to get a little more detailed, complex and with associated gimmicks. Compared to the last of the films, starring Daniel Craig, this first film seems mild. But it's a good thriller, nevertheless, and it introduces 007 to the world. Bond's humor gradually picks up in later novels and movies. But, in ""Dr. No"" we get a glimpse of it. After a hearse chasing Bond on a mountain road swerves to avoid hitting a construction vehicle, it plummets over the cliff and explodes as it rolls down the mountain. Bond gets out of his car and watches with a road worker. He comments, ""I think they were on their way to a funeral."" In another scene, he drives up to the British Consul with a dead hit man in the back seat. He gets out of the car, points at the passenger, and says to the guard standing nearby, ""Sergeant, make sure he doesn't get away.""The film introduced Swiss actress Ursula Andress to movie audiences in her first role of any significance.

49,ShadeGrenade,"""007...leave the Beretta here!""",10,8 November 2006,"Its hard to imagine the impact that 'Dr.No' had on audiences back in 1962, particularly those not used to seeing a British film made with the same level of technical competence as American movies. Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli took a gamble by casting an unknown - Sean Connery - as the lead character James Bond. They took a further gamble by making Bond a tough cookie far removed from the elegant Clubland heroes so beloved of British fiction such as 'Bulldog Drummond' and 'Simon Templar'. The other ingredient for success was Ian Fleming, a damned good storyteller, and 'Dr.No' was one of his very best books. Britain had tired of 'kitchen sink' movies and wanted something colourful, racier and exciting. Bond fitted the bill perfectly.I saw 'Dr.No' in 1975, when it came on I.T.V. for the first time. Nowadays people grumble whenever Bond is on telly, but back then it was something of an event. The film itself begins in the style of the 'Danger Man' television series, with Connery in the McGoohan role, but effortlessly turns from a spy thriller into something approaching science fiction. Nothing like it had been seen before. Considering it was made on a low budget, it is a great achievement for Ken Adam and Terence Young. And the best was yet to come. As 'Casino Royale' has recently been remade, perhaps 'Dr.No' should be in line for the same treatment?",Dr. No

51,JamesHitchcock,The World's Least Secret Secret Agent,8,23 November 2012,"When ""Dr. No"" was released as the first James Bond film, I don't suppose anyone imagined that the franchise would still be going strong fifty years later, even though there were plans for sequels. After all, there weren't any film franchises in 1962 which had been running ever since 1912. The plot is the sort of thing which would later become standard fare in Bond films. When John Strangways, the British Intelligence chief in Jamaica, and one of his assistants are assassinated, Agent 007 James Bond, one of Britain's top spies, is sent out to investigate. He discovers that the deaths were connected to a plot to disrupt American rocket launches from Cape Canaveral by radio jamming, and that a reclusive industrialist named Dr. Julius No is the mastermind of this conspiracy. Of course, Bond is able to thwart this evil plot, with (as in all the Bond films) the assistance of a beautiful girl and a little help from the CIA. The film was produced on a comparatively low budget, and perhaps for this reason lacks some of the features of later Bond films. Apart from a few brief scenes in London, it is set in a single location, Jamaica, whereas later films often included scenes set in various exotic locations around the world. (It is fitting that the first Bond film should have been shot on the island where Ian Fleming lived for many years). Bond has to fight the villains without the aid of the high-tech gadgets which were later to become such a feature of the series, and the inventor of those gadgets, the eccentric scientist Q, does not appear. Several other recurring characters are introduced, however. These include Bond's boss M, his secretary Miss Moneypenny and Bond's friend the CIA agent Felix Leiter. Bond's girlfriend Sylvia Trench was also intended to be a recurring character, but in the event she only appeared in one more film, ""From Russia with Love"". Perhaps the producers felt that having a steady girlfriend would cramp Bond's style when it came to women. ""Dr. No"" also introduced a number of what were to become iconic traditions of the Bond films, including the distinctive ""James Bond Theme"" and the opening ""gun barrel"" sequence. It also established the tradition of a charismatic villain and a glamorous ""Bond girl"". Dr. No himself, like a number of Bond villains from the sixties and seventies, as well as some more recent ones such as Gustav Graves in ""Die Another Day"", is a megalomaniacal industrialist with ambitions of world domination; he is also linked to the international terrorist organisation SPECTRE, which plays an important role in several early Bonds. Like several villains in the series, he has a physical peculiarity, in his case pincers instead of hands, a peculiarity he shares with Tee Hee in ""Live and Let Die"". Joseph Wiseman plays him as icily calm but sinister, a man who hides his evil nature beneath a veil of surface politeness and self-control. Nobody would claim that Ursula Andress was a great acting talent; she always strikes me as one of the few actresses to become a major star on the basis of looks alone. In ""Dr. No"" she doesn't even speak her own lines- apparently someone thought that her strong Germanic accent sounded out of place. (Her character, Honey Ryder, is supposed to be a white Jamaican. Nobody seems to have thought of the obvious solution of rewriting the story to make Honey a Swiss tourist). Despite her limited acting skills, however, Ursula had enormous charisma. The scene where she emerges from the sea, wearing a white bikini and singing ""Under the Mango Tree"", has gone down in history as one of the iconic Bond moments and helped to make her a star. (It also, apparently, did wonders for the sales of bikinis). Zena Marshall also looks strikingly beautiful as the secondary Bond girl Miss Taro. Most importantly, the film also introduced the character of Bond and made a star of Sean Connery. The series does not, of course, present a realistic picture of espionage. Bond must be the world's least secret secret agent. He never bothers to disguise himself or adopt a false identity, always introducing himself as ""Bond, James Bond"". In Connery's interpretation he is sophisticated- a lover of good food and drink (especially vodka martinis, shaken not stirred) as well as beautiful women- but this sophistication hides a steely ruthlessness. Connery always played the role slightly tongue in cheek, if rather less so than his successor Roger Moore, and I think that this approach was precisely the right one.Previous spy films had either taken a very serious approach to their subject (as in something like ""The House on 92nd Street"") or had featured innocent civilians caught up in the world of espionage (as in most of Hitchcock's films on the subject). ""Dr. No"" was something new. It launched the genre of ""secret agent"" films that flourished in the sixties, such as the Matt Helm, Derek Flint and ""Man from UNCLE"" franchises, all aiming to be cool, stylish and light-hearted without actually descending into outright comedy. But it was Bond and Connery who got there first and did it best. ""Dr No"" is better than any of its imitators, and at least as good as any of the later entries in the Bond canon. In my view it has never been bettered and only equalled by some of Connery's other efforts, notably ""Goldfinger"" and ""You Only Live Twice"", and perhaps by the Daniel Craig ""Casino Royale"". 8/10",Dr. No
52,StevePulaski,The film that started an uncanny revolution,8,26 November 2012,"Dr. No begins what would evolve into a lengthy and immensely popular franchise, boasting several leading men and a plethora of intensity, characters, and plot-points. Released in 1962, this was the very first time the public saw the beloved James Bond on film and just his presence brings this film up to the level where you can not ignore it.This is largely thanks to Sean Connery, who provides a tamer, more subtle portrayal of one of American's favorite heroes. He is simple, suave, and boasts his slick swagger in every scene, with his large vocabulary and polite yet womanizing nature consuming the viewer. After the mysterious disappearance of a British spy agent, Bond (or 007, if you will) is shipped to Jamaica, to try and track down Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman), a man who houses a headquarters that is trying to disrupt a space launch by using a large radio beam. Bond teams up with Quarrel (John Kitzmiller), an islander who works closely with Bond's CIA operative (John Lord) and the gorgeous shell-diver Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), who makes a living selling shells to people along the land.By the plot itself, this is simple, effective entertainment, and by just saying the story, we get the impression that this is another entry in the long, winded genre of popcorn action flicks. On the contrary, this is a stylish espionage film, introducing us to the character of James Bond with plenty of dialog for the fanbase and interesting spy setups for those who demand less. There's something here for everyone, and for someone who lacks extensive knowledge on the field of espionage pictures, let alone British espionage films which I am told beat those in American cinema second to none, I was given a helping hand from the moment after the opening credits.Tonally, this is an uneven picture, but it rebounds and catches itself nicely before we extend the boundaries of credibility or believability. The opening sequence involving the ""Three Blind Mice"" could've set up a very, very different film. Writers Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather discipline Dr. No's screenplay so as not to welcome too many incredulous nonsense like car chases or on-foot chase sequences. And when we do get them, they are superbly styled because of the crafty camera-work by Terrence Howard and vivid visuals.Going back to Connery's wonderful performance, he is only assisted with the talent provided by Andress and Kitzmiller. Kitzmiller's Quarrel is sadly underwritten, and to see the three characters engage in more spy activity, dialog, and exploration would've elevated Dr. No to more subversive espionage heights. Still, the first and second half pick up in the fields of dialog, while the last fifty minutes provide those seeking something of traditional style spy flicks with the fun, uncertainty, and the suspense of it all.Dr. No is significant in the fact that it pretty much molded what Bond movies would later become about; style, substance, the eccentric nature of its central character, and beautiful location photography (the exterior shots of the Jamaican beach and seascape are exuberant and captivating). From what I hear, this is a tamer, more low-key Bond film than many of the slicker, more action-oriented pictures of Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan, or in modern-day's case, Daniel Craig. For me, Dr. No erects a simple, satisfying formula I wouldn't object to seeing more of, and more of its title character's swagger in limitations wouldn't be a bad thing either.Starring: Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, John Kitzmiller, and John Lord. Directed by: Terrence Howard.",Dr. No
53,Smells_Like_Cheese,Another James Bond Classic to remember,8,15 August 2006,"James Bond in Dr. No, from what I understand this was the debut of the 007 films or at least one of the first. I have to say that I really enjoyed Dr. No. Maybe even a little better than Goldfinger. Again, I've said before, I'm enjoying this in the fact that I'm getting more Austin Power jokes. Not to mention finally I know where Dr. Evil comes from.Dr. No is the new villain and he has an island where he is killing everyone who steps on it and plans for world domination. But James along with a new honey, ironically named Honey, will stop him and have enough time for cuddles and smooches. So far out of Golfinger, I think I liked Dr. No better.

54,DKosty123,Eye Of The Bond,7,11 February 2007,"This is the first Bond that introduced the formula to the longest running film series. This is the first film which followed the most often used formula from the earliest part of the series- Super Villain out to destroy world- Bond to the rescue. Most important, this is the first Sean Connery Bond.I shudder to think what the Bond world would have done is Sean Connery wasn't the Bond for these early films. He just fit the role so well. Then Ursala Andress fit the first of the Bond Women so well too. She has been much copied but never quite equaled as in this film. She is not the helpless femme fa tale some of the films had.When I first saw this one, I thought that Dr. No was as good a start as a series could get. I still believe that. As this film amongst all the early Bonds ages, the technology looks more & more crude. But the action though looking more contrived with age, still is effective in moving the story along.Jack Lord as the first Felix Liter is a bonus as Lord is a very good actor who always lent credibility to any role he played. I wish Lord had done some more of the Felix roles in other films, but this is the only one. This film, the eye of the Bonds, is good. The eyes have it & Ursala forever etched in them eyes.155",Dr. No

56,Red-Barracuda,Excellent start to a great adventure,9,17 November 2017,"Dr. No will always retain a footnote in history for being the first movie in a franchise which would go on to become the most lucrative in cinema history. Based on the second of Ian Fleming's novels about the British Secret Service Agent 007, the spy with a license to kill, James Bond. It is easy to not realise now that up to the release of this film, there really had been no screen hero like this. Never before had there been a character with such a tongue-in-cheek, morally ambivalent and hedonistic approach, a man whose own pleasures were at least as important to him as was the mission he had been sent on; he changed audience expectations of what a hero could be. In fact, this film caused some controversy on release on account of Bond's behaviour, not only his sexual dalliances but also his flippant attitude towards killing where in one scene he shot an injured adversary in the back. Up to this point British heroes tended to be of the stiff upper lip variety, gentlemen who reluctantly killed. Sean Connery puts in a very confident performance here that would forever set the standard for future portrayals, he is witty, suave and brutal. Aside from the Bond character, this film was also a massive shot in the arm for the action genre generally. It brought a whole new world of glamorous excitement, a world populated by beautiful women, exotic locations and high-octane action set-pieces. It was, and still is, a very attractive concoction.Like most films in the series, the story isn't exactly anything to write home about. Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the murder of a fellow British agent, which soon leads to a private island owned by a Chinese evil genius called Dr. No who has come up with a scheme to divert rockets fired from Cape Canaveral off their course and blackmail the U.S. into getting normal service restored. Or something. It's a story which is no more than a means to an end to allow for all the glamorised elements to come together – it's a formula that the series rarely strayed too far from. Seeing as this was the first movie, there was no title song sung by a prominent singer of the day but it was the first outing for the seminal 'James Bond Theme' by Monty Norman, which would go on to be used in every subsequent film in the series. Aside from this the somewhat atypical calypso tune 'Under a Mango Tree' features quite prominently, adding to the Caribbean flavour. This is all well and good but Dr. No is probably as celebrated for its introduction of the concept of what would go on to be known as the Bond Girl, and for many Ursula Andress remains the definitive example. She appears as a shell collecting uber-babe called Honey Ryder in a sea-emerging sequence which is so thoroughly iconic you would have to be living under a rock to not be aware of it in advance of seeing this movie. I daresay that Andress replete in bikini and/or wet-shirt for the duration of her screen-time made some serious ripples back in the early 60's. To be fair, Honey Ryder remains a knockout to this day and, as far as I'm concerned, you can't have too many Bond Girls in a movie.Overall, this really is an excellent start to a series which for my money operated at its highest level during the 60's era. In some ways it is charmingly under-done if anything, with an atypically rushed ending, which doesn't extend its action set-piece to epic scale, which in fairness was a feature which was to some of the later film's detriments. But as a fairly stripped-down Bond movie, which still has all the ingredients we love, Dr, No remains a huge amount of fun and would serve as the template movie for the glamourized spy film sub-genre forever more.",Dr. No
57,KineticSeoul,The start of a flawed and yet cool and iconic super spy in film form,7,26 January 2016,"This is the start of the most notorious and iconic super spy played by one of the most well known actor to play him, Sean Connery in film form anyway. So James Bond or 007 is a fictional super spy created by Ian Fleming that is played by multiple actors in movies. ""Dr. No"" is actually quite a gritty film from the 60's despite it being really cheesy and even corny at times. Even the plot is not something you can take seriously, but it nails James Bond as a deadly, suave, collective and womanizing assassin that dresses like a gentleman but will use anything in his arsenal to complete his mission. Going up against a evil guy named Dr. No who thinks he is the king of the world. There is just so many iconic moments in this film that other movies either try to make a spoof out of or do a parody out of. However this is a secret agent movie that was made with a very low budget so the set pieces, the costumes and even the action may come off lame although it's a movie that came out in the 60's. This film doesn't hold up in today's standards but I appreciate it for what it was for it's time. And it's too iconic of a film to not watch at least once.7/10",Dr. No
58,OllieSuave-007,The first James Bond 007 film!,9,3 March 2014,"This is the first ever James Bond film, starring Sean Connery as the first actor to portray the James Bond, Agent 007. This movie's story is not Bond's first outing, but just one of many of Bond's missions and adventures; here, he is sent to find missing MI6 agent John Strangways in Jamaica. The trail leads Bond to Dr. No, owner of a mine in the Crab Key island, where the locals avoid, but where Bond encounters ""Bond Girl"" Honey (Ursula Andress). Bonds soon must battle Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), whose mission is to destroy the U.S. space program.Armed with secret and bizarre gadgets and an armor of deadpan humor, one-liners and wits, with a suave personality to top, Connery shines as 007 and proves his ""License to Kill"" attitude is a force to be reckon with, battling villain after villain, giving us thrilling actions. Dr. No's lair is a specter only to be seen to believe, which symbolizes superb special and visual effects, especially a film made in the 1960s.Thrown in 007's iconic music theme and some incredible acting, this is a brilliant film to introduce the audience into the world of James Bond on the Big Screen.Grade A",Dr. No
59,sddavis63,The Beginning Of Bond,5,11 November 2012,"Until this moment I've only ever seen two James Bond films through to the end. I was in high school in the late 70's/early 80's and I had a buddy who was a Bond-maniac, so we went to a couple together (one, I believe, was ""Moonraker;"" I can't think of the other one.) Neither impressed me. James Bond didn't seem to be my type of movie or story, to be honest, so I've never bothered with any of the other movies. Well, in honour of the release of the most recent Bond film (""Skyfall"") and working on the assumption that when a franchise has been going for 50 years and shows no sign of stopping it has to have something going for it, I decided to go back to the beginning, and watched the first Bond film, ""Dr. No."" To be blunt, it really didn't inspire me to become interested in the series. James Bond must really just not be my type of movie.Not that it was bad. To give credit where credit is due, Sean Connery stepped into the role (for which I understand he was not the first choice) without effort. He was quite good and convincing and from the first scenes he managed to define James Bond. (Even I, who had never watched a Connery-Bond flick until now) had Sean Connery's face in my mind when I thought of Agent 007.) The supporting cast was just that - supporting. This was a James Bond movie; Connery was the one who really mattered. The only important thing is that none of the supporting cast hurt the movie at all. I also appreciated that Bond in this was pretty low tech. He carried a gun, but nothing else, and he wasn't turned into any sort of superman action type. He was very human. So, indeed, this wasn't bad. For me, though, ""not bad"" isn't good enough, especially given the hype around any movie that features 007, and the fanaticism with which some people follow the series.For whatever reason, I simply didn't find the story of ""Dr. No"" to be especially captivating. The title character (played by Joseph Wiseman) is a mysterious one, somehow interfering with American rocket launches from a complex on a private island off the coast of Jamaica. Bond, along with CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) has to figure out how to stop this, since the U.S. has a major launch coming up. Leiter is background, of course. Bond does all the work. Ursula Andress is in this, usually looked upon as the first ""Bond girl,"" named Honey Ryder. She's lovely, but also not especially important, except as someone Bond can rescue in the end. To be honest, I found the first Bond villainness (Miss Taro, played by Zena Marshall) to be much more interesting.This movie deserves credit, no doubt, as the first in a seemingly never- ending series that just keeps going. I may not be a James Bond-fan, but I can't deny that others have been hooked by 007. So be it. For me, this gets 5/10.",Dr. No
60,thesar-2,Dr. No. 1,5,3 March 2013,"Okaymaybe it was the BluRay of Dr. No that made this almost 60-year old look gorgeous. I mean, the cinematography, landscapes, scenery and sets looked crisp and grand. And luckily, we had that to look at during the incredibly long and uninteresting pauses between action, dialogue and plot advancement.Even though this is my first time ever seeing the original theatrical released James Bond feature, Dr. No, it's probably unfair to review it now, even though I'm prepping for the 23rd Bond film later this year. I mean, the way movies were made back then, the tolerance of the audience for spy/action movies and element of surprise was probably wholeheartedly different than 2012, but dang was I bored for the most part.And what's with all the numerous expendable bad guys being either wimps or incredibly stupid? Again, it's probably just the timeframe this was made. So, I give this a little bit of slack.What I won't discount is the pacing. I've seen plenty of movies prior to the 1960s that were well paced and quick and to-the-point. This one seemed to drag on while James Bond, the anti-secret-identity super-spy, basically put the pieces of the puzzle together at ease.The plot involves some spies being killed and Bond, James Bond (the Smirking Sean Connery) is called in to investigate at a snail's pace. Along the way, he meets Americans on his side, Boat Captains who call him Captain and Girls on beaches with funny names. Eventually he meets the (non-Asian) Asian title character, Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) who is, surprisingly, a more interesting character than Bond himself.Honestly, the original Bond movies – and I'm referring to anything before Timothy Dalton, aren't my bag, baby. They're enormously dated and not of my generation of ""I Want it NOW."" I didn't hate on this – again, I loved the cinematography and it wasn't a bad movie, per se, but I couldn't tolerate the unedited scenes of drawn-out blankness.Sorry, chaps, this ""original"" spy movie is ONLY good for those who grew up in this era and have already seen this during that time. For anyone born, say, in the 1970s on up, this isn't for them. Or me.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the ""odd one out"": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)",Dr. No
61,lost-in-limbo,Bond James Bond.,8,13 September 2009,"The one that started it all for Ian Fleming's suavely emblematic spy. 'Dr. No' might not be regarded as one of the best, but the sensationalized influence it had in pop-culture can not be match and it's where the franchise's workably polarized formula gets the novelties set in motion. The unforgettably classic line ""Bond James Bond"". Martini, shaken not stirred. The lethal Walther PPK. Beautiful ladies with enticing names. Larger-than-life villains. Variously scenic locations around the world. A saucy opening theme song. Some humor along the way (which through time varied in styles) and some spectacular slabs of exciting action set-pieces. What an impressionable mixture and it turned out to be a successful one, as the series is still growing. Anyhow 'Dr. No' might look primitively basic in it's range, but still manages a lot interest in its well-established and complete investigative story and grows with a dependably relaxed, but resourceful performance by Sean Connery in the starring role as the English spy 007, James Bond that would go on to make him a household name. Often seen as the best Bond it's hard to argue, even though I favor Timothy Dalton small stint in the role. The performances outside Connery are acceptably able. A drop-dead gorgeous Ursula Andress gets credit as the first Bond beauty, but it's the headstrong, but gorgeously wonderful Eunice Gayson as Slyvia Trench (my favourite Bond beauty) that catches my eye in the scene where Bond introduces himself for the first time and how can you forget the scene when she's waiting for him at his hotel room. She would appear one more time in the follow-up ""From Russia with Love"", but never again. Strangely she seemed to be more so the seducer when the two were together. Originally she was planned to be Miss Moneypenny, but Lois Maxwell (who's always great) made it her role. Jack Lord is solid as he plays the CIA agent Felix, who later would become a good friend of Bond. Joseph Wiseman's unwavering turn as the villain Dr. No isn't that imposing, but suitably does what's needed of him in his quest for world domination whilst spending most time on his secluded item in a hidden lair planning on destroying the U.S. space program with his nuclear capabilities. Bernard Lee as M shares some delightful passages with 007.Director Terrance Young (who would go on to direct ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Thunderball"") demonstrates an conservatively customary approach with a steady pace, but would break out moments of suspense with an always dangerous edge and worked in expressively lucid photography of striking locale locations. The concept here seemed a little bigger than what the budget would allow, but it was a neat display with what they had to work with. Monty Norman's acute score is explosively expansive with its flavored boost and would go on to be a true trend-setter for things to come namely that classy Bond theme.",Dr. No
62,Robert_duder,My James Bond fascination continues with the original classic...what have I been missing!!,8,15 April 2008,"For those of you who aren't a regular reader of mine then you won't know that in my thirty years Casino Royale with Daniel Craig was my first Bond film I ever laid eyes on. They just never really caught my attention even though they are so hyped but Casino Royale (see my review) blew me away and I forced myself to finally just now sit down and watch the original James Bond film that started it all. Dr No. started slow and I had my doubts but by the end of it all Sean Connery and his original James Bond has seduced me and I was hooked. The film, at least this original one, is not really an action film. Dr. No is really a mystery spy thriller and a captivating one at that and it created a character with perhaps some of the most distinct traits in Hollywood history. It's all packed into Dr. No. He seduces one woman after another in a sleazy and (now) unacceptable manner, but he is suave, smooth, unassuming, smart, he drinks martini's shaken, not stirred, his name is Bond, James Bond, and he takes on a villain of the most nastiest nature. The story is fairly simple and easy to follow with an exotic locale in the Caribbean and you can't help but get hooked on every minute.I have now seen two Bonds and I have to say after seeing Dr. No that as of right now Sean Connery is my Bond. I love Daniel Craig, I thought he was brilliant and a little grittier but Sean Connery was smooth as hell. I am completely straight but in 1962 when he donned the James Bond bit Connery was sexy. He is so debonair and smooth. I wouldn't say he's quite as masculine or strong as Craig or as I would have pictured Bond but he makes up for it in smarts and knowledge. He's like Batman. Connery was the perfect choice. Although not shown a lot Joseph Wiseman is really terrific as the evil Dr. No. He certainly looks the part and plays a very terrifying villain and the perfect adversary to Connery's Bond. Bernard Lee plays his small cameo as 'M' the straight laced and always serious leader of the organization Bond works for. And Lois Maxwell plays the insatiably flirtatious Miss Moneypenney. Both of them are staples to the series. Ursula Andress is the very first Bond girl and does pretty well in the role considering their entire job is to get seduced and worked over by Bond.I always thought Bond plots were complex and that is part of the reason I steered away because it just seemed like there was always so much going on but that wasn't the case at all. Dr. No's plot was simple and the characters really get your attention and it's a true escape from reality type of film. Every guy wants to be James Bond and every girl wants James Bond and that is how Ian Fleming created the character and that is how they present him in this film. Dr. No is important because it sets the base for every future Bond film which basically has existed for the past nearly five decades every two years give or take. If you love Bond or haven't gone back and seen this one you need to check it out because it will jump start a passion for the series. 8.5/10",Dr. No
63,Lejink,"No, well maybe...",6,22 August 2011,"The first, but not the best Bond. Most of the constituent parts are there, the spy intrigue, the beautiful girls, car chases, casual violence, M & Miss Moneypenny, S.P.E.C.T.R.E (but no Blofeld), the droll humour and of course Sean Connery in the Bond role, but there's no change of locations, big action sequences, no gadgetry and no soundtrack song. To be fair, some people would be quite happy with those exclusions, but personally I like a bit of bang for my buck and actually found my interest drifting in the second third of the movie.Thus the film comes across as the least Bond-like of all the succeeding features, but certainly the building bricks are there, right at the start and of course we now have the unbroken circle perpetuating itself, with Daniel Craig's Bond (the most Connery-like of the successors) taking us back to Year One, as it were, with ""Casino Royale"".Perhaps if I wasn't judging it in context of all the others I might have appreciated it more. As an occasionally exotic, exciting, contemporary spy thriller it's fine although dated by its slower pacing as well of course of its more specific treatment of women as playthings. That said, it's not every film of the early 60's where an an unarmed woman is gunned down in cold blood in the opening minutes.Connery obviously hit the ground running with an assured performance in the title part. Ursula Andress is somewhat limited in her acting skills but does creditably after her iconic introduction on screen. Joseph Wiseman as the villainous Dr No is good too, although for me he doesn't get enough screen time and deserves a better death although minds will naturally wander to Fu Manchu with whom he appears indistinguishable.I enjoyed it enough and thrilled every time that great theme tune loomed in the background, but lessons would be learnt from this opening gambit of 007 and things would get better yet, in years to come.",Dr. No
64,ElMaruecan82,Sean Connery launches James Bond's career...,8,6 January 2016,"In 2006, at the Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony, of the American Film Institute, Mike Myers, the comedian of similar background as the legendary Sean Connery, paid a wonderful tribute to the Scottish legend. Among many touching things, he said about him that he was the kind of men men wanted to be and women wanted to be with. It won't come as a surprise then that this compliment totally applies for the character that launched his career: Bond, James Bond, Agent 007, on Her Majesty's Secret Service and so forth. Basically, Connery, virtually unknown in 1962, was born to play Bond, but may I add that Bond, created by former Service Secret agent Ian Fleming, was a character begging to be played by Connery.Indeed, both the character and actor depended so much on their respective appeal that we could go as far as saying that Connery launched Bond's ""career"" as well, and I believe Daniel Craig and all the other James Bond actors owe to Connery, and I'm not so sure the series would have had the same impact had Roger Moore been the first. This is a crucial point because one shouldn't take for granted that what made the film work was totally independent from the actor, and had more to do with the material borrowed from the original novels than any cinematic presence. Yes, there are John Barry's iconic score, the escapism, the action and the sexiness of James Bond and his female sidekicks but it's Connery who catches the eye and carries the difficult task to make everything plausible and believable.And you bet I believe that this young dark-haired, tall and athletic actor with that Scottish drawl could have any woman he wanted in a snap of fingers. I could believe that he was also a man of efficient physical intimidation and even capable of cold-blooded killings, without the typical overuse of wisecracks. I could believe all the extraordinary skills he displayed. Whatever you want to define in Sean Connery's appeal, you'll understand why an actor like Sean Penn has only the first name in common with him. Penn is probably a more versatile and multi-layered actor, but all the talent in the world can't buy the alpha-male charisma of Connery. Just have a look at the two actors, and see which one aged the better.But if we give the main actor the credit he deserves, let's not forget that ""Dr. No"" introduced one of the most enduring franchises ever, 50 years and half as many movies, and it's still going on. The reasons of this longevity can be found on the first film. The seminal James Bond formula is all there: a mysterious incident, a mundane Bond, a secret mission, a few wisecracks exchanged with Miss Moneypenny, the usual three James Bond girls, the most significant one appearing in the third act, the escapism and the sophisticated villain whose identity is revealed near the end. Now, when you go to watch a James Bond film, there are unavoidable gimmicks, a ""Star Wars"" movie can't open without John William's fanfare, a James Bond needs all these elements I mentioned.But have you noticed that today, these elements became more relevant than James Bond himself? Because as soon as Connery ceased to play Bond, the actor mattered less than all the peripheral things that make the franchise so iconic. Yet it had to start with an actor who'd matter, and creates this 'bond', no pun intended, with the audience. Can you imagine Bogie not playing Rick Blaine, Harrison Ford not playing Han Solo? Well, Sean Connery was James Bond, even though the role belongs to other actors. He is Bond because he played him naturally, without the necessity to meet some fans' requirements; in fact, he didn't even please Ian Fleming himself (he would change his mind after ""From Russia With Love""). Connery was the pillar on which the formula could rely. Terence Young directed the film, and the result was fine, but since he'd direct later the disastrous ""Inchon"", I'm inclined to think that any actual director would've made a good movie.Now, how about ""Dr. No""? Is it a good movie? Yes. A great one? As great as a film that introduces the most legendary movie franchise can be. The whole appeal is based on that, which doesn't make it undeserved. In fact, it's precisely the fact that it is slightly under the expectations that make the surprise not unpleasant. There wasn't the overdose of action sequences or special effects; Joseph Wiseman plays an interesting cool-named villain, and a fine match for 007. Eunice Gayson is unbelievably sexy for the time, especially in that scene when she plays golf in Bond's room, wearing only his shirt. I even found that sexier than Ursula Andress' legendary entrance with that white bikini (you gotta wonder where she had put her clothes anyway). So, I find unfair to attribute the title of seminal James Bond girl to Ursula Andress since it's Gayson who introduces the agent and his iconic ""Bond. James Bond"". Not to be too harsh on Ursula Andress, but the first time I saw her, I didn't think much of her, the bikini wasn't as sexy as the legs-shot on Eunice Gayson, her shoulders looked rather broad, and her face not that appealing, it's not until the first close-up on her face that I found her absolutely stunning. I guess she someway embodies my feeling of ""Dr. No"": on its own, the movie doesn't have something special and revolutionary, but when you get closer, you find out that the film gets all these little pieces together very well, and it had the intelligence to keep James Bond aka Sean Connery in every frame. Some stuff will seem dated from today's perspective, even slightly laughable but nonetheless, ""Dr. No"" marks the birth of a cinematic legend, two, if you count the character.",Dr. No
65,bowmanblue,James Bond: the prototype,8,15 November 2014,"A lot of the reviews for Bond's first ever outing, aka 'Dr No' give it the full five out of five stars. And I can see why. It was (and still is) the archetype for the whole 'Bond movie format' which not only spawned countless sequels, but plenty of imitators.So, if you've been a fan of Bond since the beginning, you'll probably love it because it was so original and ahead of its time. Then again, if you're relatively new to the franchise (especially if you've only seen Daniel Craig's offerings), you may barely recognise it as a Bond film. 'Bond' has come a long way since then (for better or worse if up to you to decide) and Dr No could be construed as more of an interesting piece of cinema to see how one of the longest-running franchises all began.I'm only giving it four out of five stars because, if you take away its originality and generally setting the bench mark high, it's not actually the best Bond movie out there. It did however plant plenty of interesting seeds which would later be expanded in the subsequent films. It's all about beginnings. Sean Connery (although naturally excellent), isn't quite there yet as Bond. In a few films time he really gets going and cements the role as his own.However, even though I'm only giving it four stars, I would recommend it for everyone. Part of its charm is that it's more like 'Saturday afternoon action' which is actually suitable for the whole family to cheer on Bond and boo the baddies.Unless you really hate the whole premise of Bond then you'll probably love this.",Dr. No
66,dromasca,the birth of the myth,7,3 November 2020,"Sean Connery's departure to a better world has brought to the attention of moviegoers some of his most famous films, including the first films in the James Bond series. On this occasion, I also completed my spectator record by seeing 'Dr. No ', the film directed by Terence Young that inaugurated in 1962 this series, the longest in the history of cinema. The film withstands the nearly six decades of its making very well, and Sean Connery proves to be, as the fans of the series and the character say, one of the best, if not the best James Bond in history. 'Dr. No' is one of the two films that Ian Fleming, the creator of the hero and the author of the novels that were in turn transformed into film scripts, got to see. It is the film that is closest to the writer's intentions and the way James Bond is presented in the books. At the same time we can already find in 'Dr. No ' many of the spectacular elements that will be developed and become dominant for the James Bond brand in the 24 films made in the almost six decades that followed.Sean Connery's James Bond in this film has charm and is already licensed to kill, but he is not yet super-technologically gifted. Sophisticated weapons are missing and the character Q. (the technical genius of the English secret services) does not appear yet. Bond's mission takes him from London to exotic Jamaica, but the story is more of a traditional investigation in which Bond investigates the disappearance of the two English agents on the island and which is only further complicated by an international espionage story in which at stake is the launching of the first American space missions from Cape Canaveral. James Bond is here in good relations with the CIA agents, we are far from the world of the intrigues between allies in John le CarrÃ©'s novels (and the films inspired by them). The first spectacular chase with cars also appears, James Bond is already drinking his martini with a drop of vodka, receiving orders from M. and flirting with Miss Moneypenny. Joseph Wiseman is an adequate Dr. No, the first evil opponent of James Bond and the first on-screen representative of the organization S.P.E.C.T.R.E. But the most memorable appearance is of course that of Ursula Andress coming out of the sea like an Aphrodite in a bikini and setting the high standard for the series of magnificent Bond girls which we will meet at least one in each of the following films from the series.The execution is excellent. The pace is a little less alert than in newer movies, but this minus is offset by humor and a relaxed approach. The reconditioned version I saw looks great, and the cinematography already has some of the exoticism that will characterize the next movies. Much of the basic elements of the myth are in place, and 'Dr. No ' is not only a good launching pad for the entire series, but also an action movie that fans of the genre will enjoy watching or watching again nowadays.",Dr. No
67,ThomasDrufke,"Suave, Sophisticated, Smashing",7,11 September 2015,"That's what the back-cover of the DVD states the film is, and that's damn right. This was my second time watching Dr. No, and it was just as fun if not more than the first. I'm lucky to be a part of a generation who has many choices of Bond's. There are six actors to play Bond theatrically to date, and perhaps no one was better than Sean Connery. As much as I love Daniel Craig in the role these days, Connery plays Bond a bit smoother and is definitely more of a ladies man. It's pretty insane to think about how many different women Bond hooks up with throughout the film. More importantly, the title villain, Dr. No, is one of the better villains the series has had. A hero is only as good as his villain, lucky for James, the doctor is a very intriguing character. I will say the film is structured very different than other Bond films. There is a much clearer beginning, middle, and end, which can be a good and bad thing. At times the movie feels different than the last segment. The tone is pretty consistent, sure, but there's something to be said about one fluid story.With that being said, I really like the supporting characters put around Mr. Bond. We don't get a great look at his co-workers back at MI6, but Honey Ryder and Quarrel do a great job at grounding the story and giving Bond something to fight for. Connery doesn't necessarily feed off the bada** in 007, but the man could not be more slick in terms of the efficiency in which he gets things done.7.8/10",Dr. No
68,gbill-74877,Establishing a franchise,7,22 September 2019,"The film should get a lot of credit for being the prototype 007 film, the beautiful cinematography in Jamaica, that fantastic theme song, and ultra-cool Sean Connery. This is peak male fantasy from the moment we're introduced to James Bond at that gambling table, and continuing on to his sexual dalliances. Unfortunately, the film suffers upon watching it 57 years later from a rather slow pace, some silly plot elements (the natives really think that car is an actual dragon?), and white actors playing characters of mixed Asian descent - so if you're new to the franchise, I don't think I would start with this one. On the other hand, the lean plot is clean and understandable, you get that iconic moment with Ursula Andress emerging from the sea, and a fantastic interchange between Dr. No and Bond in his island fortress over dinner and a bottle of Dom Pérignon '55. Sophisticated aesthete that he is, Bond prefers the '53 of course, and quips ""Does the toppling of American missiles really compensate for having no hands?""

69,cricketbat,Building the foundation for better Bond movies,6,7 January 2020,"I respect Dr. No for launching the James Bond film franchise. However as a movie, it's kind of dull.

72,Bored_Dragon,"""Bond. James Bond.""",6,24 May 2021,"The first film of one of the longest-running franchises in history. James Bond, Agent 007, is a British secret agent with a license to kill, known for more than half a century for resourcefulness, various gadgets, and seduction of women.The story is quite naive, somehow comic-book-like ""tongue-in-cheek"" unreal. While investigating the disappearance of a colleague, Bond finds himself on a forbidden island, ruled by a criminal mastermind, a crazy scientist who, with the help of advanced technology, strives for world domination. Dr. No and his island somewhat reminded me of the legendary Captain Nemo and his Nautilus.While the interior of the villain's underground lair is retro-futuristic, the island itself is a tropical paradise, from which emerges the future sex symbol, Ursula Andress. Before he will save and seduce this puberty dream of the sixties, we see Bond in the arms of two more enchanting ladies, Eunice Gayson and Zena Marshall. Still, although he seduces three beauties in two hours of film, Sean Connery is much more realistic and believable than his successors. Bond's self-confidence hasn't yet grown into arrogance, and Connery's charm is more natural. Besides, he still doesn't have his ""Sport Billy"" gadget for every, even the most unpredictable situation, but he relies exclusively on experience and intellect.I believe that this film was spectacular in its time, but it has aged quite badly, especially in the technical sense. Not serious enough, unconvincing, and almost completely linear, today it can hardly be considered a thriller, and the action is not particularly impressive either. However, the imaginative set design, Bond girls, and incredible charisma of Sean Connery make it worthy of attention, as well as, of course, the fact that it has launched the iconic franchise that lasts for almost sixty years now.6,5/10.",Dr. No

Connery is fine, although he had not yet fully grown into the role of the quintessential Bond. Andress is the iconic Bond girl, wearing little more than a bikini for most of the film, and doing a damn good job of it. As a precursor to his ""Five-O"" role, Lord plays a CIA officer in a tropical paradise. The plot is as silly as the later films, something about the title character using a nuclear reactor to thwart the US space program. Although more low-key than later entries, there is enough action to make it fun to watch.",Dr. No
74,The-Sarkologist,The first Bond movie will always be a classic,9,25 December 2012,"This is the very first James Bond film and many of the more recent productions come nowhere near as close. While it was not the first Bond film I ever saw (I believe those honours would go to Octopussy) it is still one of my favourites. Dr No pretty much sets the scene for the rest of the franchise, and for a film to spawn another 24 sequels, that, I must say, is an impressive feat.I guess the main thing we learn here is why Bond always carries his beloved Walther PPK, and that is because M gives it to him to replace the Beretta that jammed on the previous mission (we are never told what that previous mission is, but in the books it is From Russia with Love, which is the sequel to this film). We are also introduced to SPECTRE (the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion, to which Bond replies that the revenge department is right up his alley). SPECTRE never actually appears in the books, being an organisation that was created specifically for the films (and later a law suit meant that it could not be used anymore).Basically one of the British agents in Jamaica goes missing, so Bond is sent to find out what is going on (and we also discover that he is always willing to put off an important flight for half an hour to spend time with a beautiful woman). Anyway, in Jamaica he learns that American missiles are being toppled, that is having their gyroscopic systems interfered with so they go off course. As it turns out there is a moon mission going on, and Bond must get to the bottom of this so that the mission itself is a success.Oh, and when we first meet Bond, he is playing Baccarat (his favourite game), drinking a Vodka Martini, Shaken not Stirred (his favourite drink) and when he is asked his name, he answers with 'Bond, James Bond'. However, what is also interesting is to see the old sixties special effects (which are laughable at times) as well as the fashions (I swear that in one scene Sean Connery could have been called Harry Highpants). The other thing is that this film comes across more as a detective movie rather than an action blockbuster. Much of the movie involves Bond asking questions, following leads, and trying to get to the bottom of this mystery.",Dr. No

76,slightlymad22,Nice To Meet You Mr. Bond,7,3 May 2017,"Having completed my look at Clint Eastwood's acting Filmography, I have decided to move on to the legend that is Sir Sean Connery. Dr.No (1962)Plot In A Paragraph: James Bond (Sean Connery) a resourceful British government agent seeks answers in a case involving the disappearance of a colleague. Our introduction to 007 is classic Bond. The first shot of him was at the gaming tables, only his fingers and the cards are visible, followed by a close up of his face as he lit a cigarette as the soundtrack played his signature tune. Agent 007, licensed to kill, but not be killed, thought all villains single-handedly, surviving bullets, water, fire and even electricity. He was a comic strip hero, a Superman or a Captain America. An immensely good-looking and immensely well groomed 1930s hero updated to the 1960s. He was cool, sharp and cunning. Thoroughly professional at all times, fast with his gun, nifty on his feet, nifty in bed, and always had time for sex, even if he was about to be murdered. He was the sort of hero who made love to a woman just before he handed over to the police. And with his tongue firmly in his cheek Connery played him perfectly. Jospeh Wiseman played the title character very coldly, but he doesn't leave much of an impression. Unlike Ursula Andres as Honey Rider. The original 'Bond Girl' and one often most imitated. In my youth, I spent many an hour, slowly pausing the radio active shower scene on video (long before DVD made this process much easier) hoping to catch it just right, to see if she was really nude or not. Oh the memories.Sadly the movie has not aged well, the fight scenes often look clumsy, over rehearsed and at worst poorly co-ordinated. On a $1.1 million budget, Dr. No grossed $16 million at the domestic box office, to end 1963 as the 9th highest grossing movie of the year.",Dr. No
77,paulclaassen,"Apart from Sean Connery, there's nothing special here.",4,4 July 2021,"Ahh, and so here we are: the very first James Bond film. How nice; a time before CGI took over the film industry, and movies were shot on location with practical effects.Its interesting to see this very first film didn't have as much action and none of the gadgets and fancy cars the series is renowned for. I must be honest, I had a difficult time following the plot. I know Bond (Sean Connery) was investigating the disappearance of a colleague and his secretary, and then became involved in the wrong doings of an antagonist called Dr No. I honestly had no idea what it was all about apart from wanting to rule the world.Dr No (Joseph Wiseman) only makes his appearance towards the end of the film, which is not standard procedure for a film's villain. When I did a screen writing course, they insisted the villain should appear early in the film. So, what happened here and why was this acceptable? This espionage thriller gets a bit too involved, and confusing.Note the bad sound effects, as well, which I suppose was the norm for its time. I mean, screeching tires on a gravel road during a chase sequence!!! The action sequences are also not all that impressive. The best part about the film, were Sean Connery's shirtless scenes on the island - this man is a stud! And then there's the now famous scene of the first Bond girl, Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress) walking onto the beach from the sea. And off course that iconic Bond score. The 'love interest' between Bond and Honey felt all too forced and for effect only. It is unrealistic at best. Dr No's friendly gesture towards Bond and Honey is also questionable. Why would he do that? What did he have to gain? The short-lived climax is over before the viewer can even truly grasp what is actually happening.The Production Design is very good, and clearly a taste of what was to come in future movies. In general - for me - there was nothing all that special about this first Bond installment. It wasn't action-packed, it was more confusing than intriguing, and had plot flaws galore. Sean Connery with his charm, dashing looks and deep voice made the movie more enjoyable.",Dr. No

80,eddie_baggins,The way Bond is meant to be,8,3 March 2021,"There's a lot of love for the modern day James Bond, moving on from the silliness and playfulness that laid at the heart of the series in the years before Casino Royale hit, but there's unquestionably a place and even an argument for the fact that the likes of Dr. No are really what Britain's most famous secret agent are all about.Premiering to so-so reviews and somewhat mid-tier box office receipts, 1962's first big screen Bond wasn't an overnight success but Terrence Young's adaptation of Ian Fleming's popular book series has lived a long and prosperous life since as audience members from around the globe found themselves attracted to the sun-drenched locales, the beautiful woman and the devilishly charming agent that was bought to life by a now iconic Sean Connery.It's not to say that time has not wearied this cocktail of murder, mystery, fine cars and even finer drinks with some of Dr. No's aspects feeling poorly dated in today's climate and its treatment of females is fairly suspect but when you let yourself be taken away on a far-fetched journey that delivers the hammy goodness of Connery chewing scenery like the best of them and Joseph Wiseman creating an iconic villain to boot, Dr. No provides viewers with one of Bond's most memorable and well-delivered outings.In light of Connery's recent passing there doesn't feel to be a better film to revisit when considering his endless screen presence when given the right role and while the likes of Daniel Craig, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have all had various impacts on the long-lasting success of the character, you'd be hard pressed to argue that Connery isn't the true one and only Bond, a role that feels as though he was born to play.Watching Connery emerge throughout as a cool-headed operative not deterred by the woman seeking his company, the assassins sent to prematurely end his life or the nefarious Dr. No spiking his coffee is an absolute cinematic pleasure and he delivers a performance here that is deserving of its reputation as one of the key cinematic performances of the era as he gave life to a character that has spanned generations and made an everlasting impact on pop culture.Final Say -Silly in parts and misguided in others, Dr. No has it's share of issues but they're not enough to derail what is the perfect example of what a 007 film should be; over the top, fun and full of attitude, the perfect antidote to the more po-faced and serious Bonds of the modern era.4 blind men out of 5",Dr. No
81,johnnyboyz,"This debut Bond film has so much going for it, that it puts others of its ilk to shame - Bond film or otherwise.",7,10 July 2013,"Watching ""Dr. No"" now is like being allowed a mystical, perverse access to what something was like before it was made famous and, some might say, ruined. It's like garnering a seat in a sports stadium to your favourite team and being allowed to watch a decent game of whatever before it was all so crudely ruined by big business and monetary venture. It's like being allowed to step back in time to an era when a specific nation was once bigger and better than what it has succumbed into being in the present; like being allowed to experience music when it was at its purest and freshest and at its time of release away from pop culture dilution. Put pure and simply, Dr. No is one of the better films of the James Bond series, a series which began small but thought big before gradually disintegrating into something which had completely outgrown its roots only to think small. To an extent, Dr. No is one of the better Bond films, but then it was always going to be - to disagree is, in a sense, a fallacy for how could something such as the Bond series run for so long if its early works were not as good as they were? There is an old fashioned strain to things here, just as there was to sport from decades ago; sport which often featured people who were plying their game second to another job and had to make the most of their run in the team for the meagre pay they might have received. The huffs and puffs of a county cricketer or a league footballer trying their damnedest here ring out in the form of narrative and actual filmmaking, whereby atmosphere and mystery take precedence over slick, production line aesthetics and people channelling more-so creating. This is the Bond film free of the things that later characterised the franchise for the worst; characteristics which would often form the basis of what a ""Bond"" film would look like rather than what a ""film"" film should look like. That is to say, audiences and their expectations regarding a set of key conventions including attractive girls; outlandish gadgets and sumptuous locations instead of the things that define the cornerstone of cinema: narrative; character; direction and so forth. When, in 1987's ""The Living Daylights"", producers tried to take it back with a grotty East German-set opening that featured a bombardment of plot and our hero haring away from an international crime scene in an Audi, it was just too much for some people.There is, of course, one or two of these things in Dr. No but such things seem to merely arrive naturally and seamlessly more-so shoehorned in. Take, nearer the end, the period synonymous with most Bond films when the big assault on the villain's lair commences. Bond only bumps into a scantily-clad newfound heroine once near this base having already arrived there with an allied gentleman days earlier. When she comes out of the sea under the sweltering sun, what else do we expect her to wear? Nowadays, Bond would've traversed the island with the heroine initially in tow while her latex jumpsuit would've been unyielding to her character enough like it were her second skin. Now take the film's tropical location being what it is, but witness how it makes perfect sense for a super-villain to base his operations there when desiring to tamper with produce as close as Florida. Dr. No actually contains a scene nearer the beginning of its famous lead's latest case whereby Sean Connery's James Bond has to walk around a crime scene and investigate things. There's a sense of detection to proceedings, the man is investigating a death and must look for clues at the scene of the crime.This crime is the murder of a British Intelligence officer, a man who is gunned down during an organised hit in the Caribbean nation of Jamaica at the bereft of a well organised gang of natives. The man investigating it is Bond, James Bond – a man whose opening utterance of his name is, fittingly, designed to be a suave and cutting response to an equally debonair woman who announces her own name as if to snide him. Bond is a character who the producers must take the time to introduce. We're told he's a golfer; it's evident he enjoys casinos and it becomes fairly obvious he's comfortable in talking to women. Through dialogue, we learn he's been doing his job for ten years and came through the ranks of intelligence to get to where he is now. Once deployed, Bond sets about uncovering the facts and what transpires is the sort of power play and tension between two very specific sides that is largely vacant in contemporary Bond films, let alone most other espionage thrillers.We observe Bond build friendships, make allies – we see him develop enemies and we witness him fight through the sludge that comes with the complexity of the case while question what draws someone Chinese to these shores in the first place. There is an odd anticipation to the film, to its scenes; an atmosphere. There is mystery behind No's island, an appealing omnipresent tone as things unravel. The film is driven by Connery's electric performance, a performance that brings to life a man who's so into what he does that when he's depicted invading a known mole's apartment, we witness him construct a trap designed to show them up to a cheesy long-play record in a manner that is positively sociopathic – and yet, there is nary any evil in what he does: it's merely his job and his job and he enjoys his job. The film is a bullish spy thriller, seemingly devoid of what makes most of its ilk nowadays as frustrating as they usually are and full of the good stuff. It's difficult not to recommend Dr. No.",Dr. No

A smash hit at the time of its initial release in Britain in October 1962-it was released in the US 7 months later in May 1963-that was ironically some two weeks before the real Cuban Missile Crisis that could have very well lead to WW III with results far far worse then whatever the crazed and ego maniac Dr. No had in store for the world.",Dr. No
84,pmtelefon,Bond gets his feet wet.,8,13 November 2019,"""Dr. No"" is a good start to the greatest movie franchise of them all. It's not one of the great Bond movies but it's a very satisfying one. ""Dr. No"" is not one of my go-to 007 movies. I always enjoy it but sometimes it comes off a little dated. ""Dr. No"" isn't as timeless as the rest of the 007 movies. The first Austin Powers movie delivered a body blow to the last twenty minutes of this movie. It's impossible to watch the climax of ""Dr. No' and not laugh remembering Austin Powers first clash with Dr. Evil. That said, there are a lot of great moments in ""Dr. No"" and I always enjoy watching it.",Dr. No
85,helpless_dancer,Not a bad spy film,7,2 September 2000,"I can't give a resounding yes to Dr. No, but it wasn't all that horrible. Certainly better than most of Fleming's books, which were slow indeed except for the last 1/3 or so. The later Bond movies were probably more action filled, but were so corny they were hard to take seriously. I did appreciate the opening scene with Andress rising up out of the sea in that revealing bikini; and the good doctor was nice and menacing.",Dr. No
86,Fella_shibby,Revisiting this film is a tribute to the original Bond.,8,28 November 2020,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs. Revisited it recently.
It is the first film in the Bond series where Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to Dr. No, a former member of a Chinese crime syndicate but currently working for SPECTRE.
Here Bond faces dragon-disguised swamp buggy, venomous tarantula spider, 'three blind mice' n a villain with metal hands.
Fortunately Bond has three amazing ladies to cool off, Eunice Gayson, Zena Marshall n Ursula Andress.Some interesting facts from the novel which is missing in the movie.
The Chinese gangsters tortured Dr No, cut off his hands n shot him through the left side of the chest and left him for dead.
Dr No survived due to a condition called dextrocardia in which his heart is on the right side of the body. He later joined SPECTRE n got his metal hands.",Dr. No
87,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Creating the foundation for the biggest movie character of all time,7,30 June 2013,"Ian Fleming's James Bond character's humble on-screen beginning is just that — humble. ""Dr. No"" is more of a mystery than an action film, so despite being the film that introduced the world to the most successful movie character of all time, it's not often considered a favorite of Bond die-hards.Yet the foundation for the Bond franchise's DNA is all here. The famous Bond theme, the opening down-the-barrel gunshot, ""Bond, James Bond"" the Walther PPK, banter with Moneypenny — all originated in ""Dr. No."" Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman honed the essence of Bond the first time through, including casting the best actor to play the role the first time in Sean Connery.Connery isn't the only thing that makes ""Dr. No"" work, but it's hard to imagine James Bond becoming the icon he is today without him, and more specifically, his performance in the film. That starts with the look. As Bond is a ladies man (and more than a few women get all out of sorts around him in this movie), Connery had to have a natural sex appeal and natural is the best way to describe it. Simply, he's a man's man, far from a pretty boy, and he cleans up like a boss. And while he's pretty smart and skilled, Connery adds some grit into the performance. Bond gets put through the ringer in this movie and he doesn't always look good doing it.""Dr. No"" introduces Bond as a playboy, but one whose duty to country calls. A fellow 00 agent who was investigating the jamming of Cape Canaveral's rocket launch signals has gone missing (permanently, a.k.a. he's dead) in Jamaica and so MI-6 sends Bond to investigate. From the moment he lands he finds he's being closely watched and everyone he tries to question won't talk. He soon collaborates with CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) and a boatman named Quarrel, where he learns of the reclusive Dr. No and his heavily manned island of Crab Key. Bond and Quarrel travel to the island where Bond discovers the beautiful Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), but not without finding himself a bit trapped.A good deal of ""Dr. No"" is slow-going, and the script relies on our curiosity about the title character in order to maintain our interest. Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) is revealed late in the game and he's worth the wait, even if we don't get nearly enough of him. Creating the mysterious aura around No is one of the best things about this movie as it set the stage for the grandiose Bond villains to come. Most of the film is steeped in reality, but once we get onto the island, we see a bit more imagination and Bond gets rightfully larger than life.Wiseman and Andress are also examples of top-notch casting decisions. Andress is absolutely magnetizing despite her character's complete and utter lack of importance to the film. She is something for Bond to do (in all senses) and something for the audience to look at (and she rocks that bikini). As much as she started the great tradition of Bond girls, she amounts to a shell-collector who found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Oh well, it was the early '60s.""Dr. No"" has to be considered a wild success, however, because it introduced us to a character who clearly caught our interest. No matter how you feel about ""Dr. No,"" it ends leaving you wanting to see more of this Bond, James Bond fellow and what beautiful women he might sleep with next while saving the world at the same time. The foundation this film builds is rock-solid, embodying nearly everything about the Bond character that we know today.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site moviemusereviews.com",Dr. No

89,Anonymous_Maxine,"It's too bad that Sean Connery foresaw the succession of awful movies that were to eventually follow, because he was by far the best James Bond ever.",8,28 July 2001,"Dr. No is the film that introduced the movie world to James Bond, the world's most famous `secret' agent. This is where we first see most of the things that have come to be traditional in 007 movies, such as Bond's indestructibility, his blatant but perpetually uneventful flirtatious exchanges with Moneypenny, and the fact that he always gets the girl, or, as is often the case, girls. What we don't see here are the fast paced opening sequence (although there is a skeletal version that can be found here) or many of the high tech gadgets that are 98% of the reason that Pierce Brosnan is able to pull off the role. Disagree? Just imagine Pierce trying to be James Bond without a brand new remote control BMW or some cool x-ray glasses. Pierce is the flashy version of the calm, collected James Bond that Sean Connery portrayed.What Dr. No lacked in sheer technological paraphernalia it more than made up for with it's character development and it's quality story. Dr. No himself is built up to be the real star of the film. We find out that people are more willing to risk substantial personal injury rather than cross him, and we know so much about him far before we ever see him that he develops a mysterious aura. He is not exactly an imaginative villain, but this suspensefully slow introduction makes him very effective (similar to the eventual introduction of Harry Lime in The Third Man, a method that prompted Orson Welles to call his part as Lime a `true star role'). While this is very effective in developing his character, his Wizard-of-Oz-like appearance in that strange room at the end of the pier was a little more on the clumsy side. But hey, he's the proud owner of the biggest baddest goldfish on the planet, so who's to argue with him?It's true that Dr. No is not the same hard core and high tech action film that James Bond has come to be known as in the latest films, but it still is not afraid to clearly broadcast its commercial intentions. While the more recent Bond films are little more than entertaining BMW commercials, this one heavily advertises vodka  I guess BMWs weren't cool enough back in 1962. In one particular scene, Bond picks up a half empty (or half full?) bottle of Smirnoff vodka, smells it, suspecting poison, and then opens a drawer and pulls out fresh bottle of Smirnoff vodka. For someone with such an important job and who has so many enemies who would love to catch him a little off guard and kill him, James Bond sure drinks a lot.
Of course, being the first Bond film, Dr. No had a lot of influence on the Austin Powers films, and this is something that is fun to watch for in the old 007 movies. We see the way Dr. No is dressed, in a prototypical outfit later adopted for Dr. Evil (the origins of that name can be found here as well), you have the goofy plastic radiation suits at the end of the film, and there are also a few pieces of dialogue that the first Austin Powers film has rendered completely hilarious (`I'm sure the west would welcome a scientist of yourcaliber?'). Interestingly enough, Dr. No seems to have borrowed from previous films as well, but not with such great success. The control room at the end of the film is strangely similar to the great machines from Metropolis, which is pretty weak as far as set design. Sure, sets in 1962 weren't as spectacular as many are today, but Metropolis' sets were just as good as those seen in Dr. No, and Metropolis was filmed in 1926. (spoilers) Bond's relationship with Honey Ryder - played by the stunningly beautiful Ursula Andress, the most beautiful Bond girl ever, but with by far the ugliest name - is not very realistic (he meets some girl on the beach who travels the world collecting shells and they are initially forced to team up, after which they gradually fall in love).But despite this, she added a great deal to the rest of the film, and she also established the tradition of the Bond girl. The day for night photography was not convincing at all, and the film even had some traces of racism that were very disturbing. For example, just after having been shot at on the beach, and the three of them are preparing to leave, Bond tells Quarrel, the simple-minded black man, to `Fetch my shoes.' Not only that, but this poor guy is dressed in a bright red shirt while they're trying to hide in the jungle, and needless to say, he dies a horrible death early in the film. It's a good thing that this racism didn't become a Bond film tradition. Dr. No is the film that started it all in the seemingly endless 007 film series, and is therefore required viewing for any James Bond fan. The film is interesting and entertaining, despite its many shortcomings, and is also worth watching because of the many things that are now amusing but were not originally meant to be. The Austin Powers stuff, of course, is funny to see, but there are also more subtle things, like Sean Connery's line, `There are no such things as dragons.' Who would have thought that this guy would go on to provide the voice for a digitally created dragon in a mediocre fantasy film in 1996? If you are into fairly well developed action films, this one shouldn't be missed.",Dr. No
90,FiendishDramaturgy,Origins,9,26 March 2008,"To say this is one of my favorite Bond films would become boring after a while of reading my reviews. I love all the Bond films, so I can't say I love this one, and have that serve as any form of distinction from the rest of the long-time run. What I WILL say is that this is probably one of the best of the Bond films, regardless of its age.At the very least, this film serves to provide the foundation for the remainder of the franchise. Anytime a director or the screenwriter comes to a point at which they do not know how to proceed, all they have to do is look back at this ONE film to regain their sense of purpose. THIS is what they are endeavoring to make: A James Bond film people will remember.This is a tall order, and they realized that once Dr. No hit the theaters. The phenomenal success of it just cemented audience expectations, pushing each film to be better than the last. Unfortunately, for many that meant gadgets instead of rich dialog, deeper intrigues instead of more realistic plots, and more Bond Girls. Of all the Bond Girls, I think Ursula Andress is possibly the most memorable; although I do tend to like Maud Adams' three Bond appearances better.All in all, this is a classic, and belongs in the collection of any aficionado.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Dr. No
91,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,3 November 2020,"It's the one that started it all isn't it? So of course there is that faction that says that Dr. No is the all time best 007 movie ever made... because credit I guess.I still like the From Russia with Love v Goldfinger debate.But what you have in Dr. No is the true, pompous, womanizing, alcoholic, chain smoking, gambling, brand conscious cold blooded assassin 007... you know, the Bond that we are SUPPOSED to have. The Bond that was intended to be written.He's the ultimate Bond because he's the one that won't hesitate to kill anyone and shows no real remorse over it.And he is lined up with all the tropes and the over-the-top completely unrealistic plots and villainy that makes 007 so watchable.",Dr. No
92,strong-122-478885,No One Knows Like Dr. No's Nose Knows?,3,22 November 2013,"So, this is it, eh? This is the one that (unfortunately) started the longest running, blockbuster film series of all time.Of course, the nifty, neat-o gadgets would all come later, as would many of the codes and conventions of the Bond series, but, clearly, right from the very start, 007 was set on a definite course of action, shooting, screwing and spying his way to the film's final credits.For starters - Let me tell ya', this film has obviously dated very-very badly. Instead of offering the viewer death-defying excitement, mixed generously with a stylish pizazz, Dr. No's humdrum story just drifted along aimlessly from scene to scene without much drive or momentum. It almost appeared to me as if the entire film crew had shot this one in their pajamas.Aside from the old ""tarantula-in-the-bed"" routine (thrown in for good measure) and the gorgeous Miss Taro venomously spitting into Bond's face (applause! applause!) after she had spent the previous hour gleefully rolling around in the sack with him, Dr. No contains absolutely no memorable scenes worthy of any sort of praising or raving. (I'm not kidding!) But, with that aside, Dr. No certainly contained lots and lots of let-downs, such as - The bikini-clad Ursula Andress (aka. Honey Ryder) emerging out of the sea. This was not... I repeat, ""THIS-WAS-NOT"" one of the sexiest moments ever recorded in the history of film.This seashell-collecting bimbo, with her well-rehearsed angry pout, put in one of the worst ""Bond-girl"" performances that I've ever seen.And, how about mad scientist, Dr. No, himself? Boy, I'm tellin' ya, this pompous, effeminate, little snot, who didn't make his wimpy, all-mighty appearance until 90 minutes into the frickin' story, made my skin crawl with his insipid presence and his rubber-gloved hands (though he was such a gracious host).To me, Dr. No's character was about as menacing as a wet fart with his drab and dreary little ""evil"" plot of absolute domination of the world. (Spare me!) As far as minor characters go - I thought that Jack Lord as American, special agent, Felix Leiter, should have been awarded a special Oscar for ""Most Boring & Forgettable Performance Ever"".And sidekick character, Quarrel, was certainly an insulting black stereotype. especially when he was revealed to be a superstitious native who seriously believed that an actual, real-life dragon was lurking around on the island of Crab Key. This became even more absurd since it was blatantly obvious to the viewer that this dragon was a tank with an unconvincing scary-face painted on its front.In between all of the slackly staged fight sequences and the silly car chase scene, Sean Connery gave a decidedly hammy performance as our hero, James Bond.And, regardless of its sometimes amusing elements of kitsch (in particular, the radioactive protective suits, especially the one worn by Dr. No). I seriously thought that, long ago, this film would have been dismissed outright as being nothing but an inconsequential relic had it not been the very first in the Bond series, which has somehow granted it an immunity from having to suffer that unbearable fate of obscurity.And, when all has been said and done, I still don't know what the hell Dr. No's beef was all about.",Dr. No
93,ianlouisiana,"Arrogant,cold - blooded,vicious,amoral killer.A hero for the 60s.",9,21 December 2007,"In its 1962 review ""Films and Filming"" wrote"" There has not been a movie like ""Dr No"" since ""Kiss me deadly"".Bond is recognisably Mike Hammer given a thin veneer of articulacy and the Upper Class Scottish snobbery so beloved of Ian Fleming.They share a patronising contempt for women hidden by a barely - controlled lust to possess them which is a manifestation of a deep fear of the opposite sex ,obviously - at least in Bond's case - instilled into him at his Public School. From this first movie on,all so - called ""Bond Girls"" were to be treated like pack - animals,whores or playthings,which should have alienated half the population,but perhaps the thought of being treated like a pack - animal,whore or plaything by Mr S.Connery rather appealed. Sexual politics aside,the novel ""Dr No"" was entertaining enough with Bentley Continentals,Casinos and exotic West Indian locations all being brought to the attention to a readership who had never seen the first two and could only dream of visiting the third. Bond himself,a wine bore of the first rank,was a former Naval officer in his mid - forties,who,in the days before High Street Gyms kept himself fit by swimming five miles a day in the sea,whatever the weather,and presumably took frequent cold showers.With his morning egg he demanded that his copy of ""The Times"" still be warm from being ironed by his long suffering Scottish ""treasure"". There are words to describe blokes like that,but they are not used in polite society. In bringing this rather unpleasant narcissistic individual to the screen the producers had a stroke of luck and/ or genius.Former model,chorus boy and second string light actor Sean Connery was considered to possess the right combination of charm and threat.Resolutely refusing to take his role too seriously,Mr Connery hit just the right note,a feat that has escaped all his successors. Terence Young keeps a tight ship on an even keel,with none of the excesses and longeurs of the later movies.The ""In - joke"" with the missing portrait of the Duke of Wellington in Dr No's HQ may have lost its relevance to 21st century audiences,but it is just one of many nice touches Mr Young added to a book that was a little short on humorous asides. Bond shoots a woman dead just after having sex with her which rather proves my point made above,and kills a defenceless man by back - shooting him in a most Un - British way....the things one is forced to do for Queen and Country 007...... For its time ,then,an extraordinary movie,certainly worthy of comparison with Robert Aldrich's masterpiece.",Dr. No
94,ackstasis,"""I can assure you, my intentions are strictly honorable.""",8,14 October 2007,"Here is a film that needs absolutely no introduction. 'Dr. No' was, of course, the first feature film based on Ian Fleming's series of novels featuring the suave, womanising British Secret Service Agent, James Bond. Directed by Terence Young, and produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli (the first film in a lengthy partnership), 'Dr. No' made an international superstar of Scottish actor Sean Connery and spawned one of the most lucrative movie franchises in cinematic history. I must admit that, beyond Pierce Brosnan's efforts and last year's excellent 'Casino Royale' with Daniel Craig, I am a complete novice when it comes to Agent 007. I can very vaguely remember seeing 'Dr. No' in my younger years, but about 98% of it had since abandoned my memory, and so watching the film very much remained a fresh experience. The story unfolds in Jamaica, where Bond is sent to investigate the suspicious death of British agent John Strangways (Tim Moxon). The mystery, he discovers, stretches to the feared island of Crab Key, where the formidable villain, Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman), has hatched a fiendish scheme to topple American rockets.Sean Connery is perfect in his signature role, and, according to many, no subsequent actors have been able to surpass him. His rugged facial features and prominent Scottish accent complement the tone and charm of Ian Fleming's literary character, and Connery's characteristic pronunciation of ""Bond. James Bond"" has been endlessly imitated ever since, and always with that hint of Scottish drawl about it. However, the character is not all about good looks and charming witticisms; James Bond have been granted a ""license to kill"" and he certainly intends to use it. In one scene that caused some controversy on release, Connery shoots a wounded and disarmed henchman in the back, an act of emotion rather than necessity. The titular villain is somewhat low-key, appearing only in the film's final act, but Joseph Wiseman plays him as an intelligent, cool and calculating evil genius. We don't quite understand the greater intentions of Dr. No's rocket-toppling efforts, but at least he doesn't seem interested in ""destroying the world,"" which appears to be the primary goal of many of cinema's less intelligent antagonists.Being the first film, 'Dr. No' also set the trend for many of the gimmicks that would become James Bond mainstays. These include the now-iconic James Bond musical theme (composed by Monty Norman and John Barry), the gun-barrel sequence (notably, the shooter is not Connery, but his stunt double Bob Simmons), the highly-stylised opening credits sequence, ""shaken, not stirred"" vodka martinis, Bond's Walther PPK, arch-villains, henchman and the terrorist organisation SPECTRE. Oh, yes, and the Bond girls! Though she isn't the first female shown with Connery in the film, Honey Ryder, an independent and beautiful shell-collector, is certainly the most fondly-remembered. She was portrayed by Swiss actress Ursula Andress, though her thick accent meant that her lines were dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl and her singing voice by Diana Coupland. All in all, 'Dr. No' is an excellent spy/espionage mystery thriller, made even sweeter by the thought that many more hours of 007 adventures await. I just hope that there are more films this good!",Dr. No

The movie dose not take long to start at all, the song of 3 old men walking,(a song singing about which I thought was really clever) but then turn out not to be , who you think they are! This movie is not action packed from start to end however it dose have some great action scenes throughout the movie. Some decent car chase scenes, one car chase scenes looked a bit out dated. I liked there few turns in story, you think the story is going one way but then take a turn, I really enjoyed this twist and turns in the movie. I really enjoyed the last 20 minutes of the movie, I was hoping for longer fight scenes at end, a little disappointing with that.The acting was great from whole cast!

96,drqshadow-reviews,Bond's First Adventure Sees Our Hero Testing His Own Character,7,18 April 2013,"James Bond dons the training wheels in his first appearance on the screen, heading off a surprise threat in Jamaica... where everyone speaks with a British accent. Without the kind of galactic-sized budget or recklessly eccentric touches that would come to define the series in later installments, I was impressed with the film's ingenuity in filling those holes. Though Bond lacks his usual cache of gimmicks and gadgets, that time is instead spent inspecting the finer points of his espionage work, which I appreciated. There's something to be said for firing lasers from a pocket watch, but I was just as captivated watching Sean Connery booby trap his closet with a single strand of hair or set up a would-be assassin by rolling his bedsheets into a bundle and laying in wait. It loses touch with that grounded sensibility in the third act, though, which is much more in-line with what one would expect from the series. Bond's dastardly eponymous foil is comically run-of-the-mill, although he doesn't truly get enough screen time to explain himself and seems far too easily defeated.

100,barnabyrudge,"The first cinematic taste of James Bond, and boy does it taste good!!",10,30 November 2004,"Still going strong four decades later, it is sometimes hard to recall where the James Bond franchise began. Dr. No was released in 1962 with the relatively unknown Sean Connery in the leading role. The original Bond author, Ian Fleming, was still alive at the time and wasn't very pleased with the casting of Connery, though he soon warmed to the actor's interpretation of the role when he saw the film.The big question is: how does Dr. No hold up over forty years on? Personally it has always been my favourite Bond movie and probably will never be surpassed. Even now, it is a step ahead of its counterparts. Connery never appeared in a better Bond flick (some were close), much less Lazenby, Moore, Dalton or Brosnan.James Bond (Connery) of the British Secret Service is sent to Jamaica to investigate the death of an operative named Strangeway. He learns that Strangeway was looking into alarmingly high radiation readings generating from a nearby island called Crab Cay. Bond heads to the island and learns that it is a suspiciously heavily guarded place, patrolled by gunmen, dogs and armed boats, and none of the local islanders dare venture near because of rumours that a dragon also guards the area. Aided by a Jamaican agent called Quarrel (John Kitzmiller) and diver Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), Bond searches the island's interior for answers. He discovers that the island is run by the deadly Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), a visionary megalomaniac who plans to disrupt the American space programme by sabotaging their shuttles from his secret island base, using gyroscopic interference to bring them down mid-flight.As the series went on, it became less and less related to the Bond of Fleming's creation, and increasingly akin to a comic book. Part of the strength of Dr. No is that it is faithful to its source. I've read Dr. No, and it is such a good book that it didn't really need altering beyond all recognition in order to be filmable - so, it's nice to report that scripters Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather have adapted it accurately. The performances are excellent: Connery confident and masculine as Bond and Wiseman fabulously sinister as Dr. No. Terence Young directs with urgency, getting plenty of excitement as well as some lovely location photography into his film (hard to believe he would go on to make such inept bombs as Poppies Are Also Flowers, Bloodline, and Inchon). Dr. No is a milestone in cinema history. It is the film that gave us our first big-screen 007; it is the grand-daddy of all globe-trotting adventure flicks; and it is a classic action film in its own right to boot.",Dr. No

103,slokes,Building An Institution In Celluoid,8,15 March 2009,"Dr. No has everything a supervillain wants, elaborate fortress, cowed acolytes, fantastic rooms designed for maximum visual impact, plans that threaten the world, and finally, a worthy adversary worthy of basking in No's brilliance before being sent to a grisly, amusing death.""I only gratify your curiosity because you're the one man I've met capable of appreciating what I've done...and keeping it to himself,"" Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) explains.This is a mistake, however, as are his instructions to his henchmen to ""soften him up"" and throw him in a cell rather than kill him outright. For No's adversary is a fellow named Bond, James Bond. Bond is about to make life very brutish and short for No, not to mention a generation-plus of other evil geniuses to come.When I first saw ""Dr. No"", it was the early 1980s and I had a decidedly negative reaction to the backwards-feeling of this inaugural piece. Sean Connery wore blue pants, his adversaries wore Glad bags, the pace was slow, the explosions few, the Bond quips less ready, and the girls wore too much clothing.There are still things about the movie that don't work too well, or have aged badly. Bond's final escape and confrontation with No is all-too-easy. A scene involving a tarantula is as fake-looking as anything in ""Die Another Day"". Yet time has been kind to this film in other ways. Now I see the classical brilliance of it, in the way it takes its time to establish the formula other Bond films would take for granted. ""Dr. No"" utilizes only two global locations. England was Bond's homeland, and Jamaica the place where Ian Fleming wrote his Bond novels, so it works wonderfully to see them here; especially Jamaica, at a time when Fleming was still living there writing Bond novels.It's worth noting and celebrating how much of this film would go on and become definitive beyond the character of Bond himself. The theme music, really by Monty Norman though I read for years that was a miscredit, remains a fixture of the series. Despite 40 years of amazing competition, Ursula Andress was recently named the Best Bond Girl of all time, and four reasons for that judgment are on ample display here (referring of course to her eyes and cheek, eh, bones). There's also M and Moneypenny and Felix Leiter, who like Bond has been played by half-a-dozen different actors over time. Here its Jack Lord, whose femmy sunglasses rival Bond's blue pants for the film's most grievous fashion faux-pas.Director Terence Young and editor Peter Hunt work wonderfully well in tandem setting up a tension that is the cinematic equivalent of what Bond readers know as ""the Fleming Sweep"". The script hews closely to the source novel, and when it departs, presents a distinct improvement. No's cover operation is a bauxite plant, not a guano farm. A pair of villains, Professor Dent (Anthony Dawson) and Miss Taro (Zena Marshall), are welcome additions to the story and help keep No comfortably offstage until the final half-hour.The script does most right, and is done right in turn, by the way it serves Connery, an actor of immeasurable presence who makes Bond believable in his chosen, deadly occupation. Connery was not my favorite Bond actor, but he was absolutely the right man for launching the role, giving Bond both a sullenness and a sense of humor that would define the role long after he left the series.Noting how No's convex undersea window magnifies fish swimming outside, Bond remarks: ""Minnows pretending to be whales. Just like you, Dr. No."" ""Depends on which side of the glass you're on,"" No replies.Speaking from this side of the window, there's no mistaking ""Dr. No"" for a minnow. In the majestic convexity of 007's world, it's the daddy of all whales.",Dr. No
104,I_Ailurophile,"A fun, uncomplicated classic",8,4 May 2021,"The James Bond film franchise has had many high points in its almost 60-year history, and too many nadirs. 1962's 'Dr. No,' as the first, is the only one that could claim to stand purely on its own merits without the baggage of the series. Even in hindsight, it is still today one of the best of all Bond's adventures.It's not perfect. The tropes that came to largely define 007 soon hereafter are still present, though certainly not to the same extent. Q Branch originated here, though in this instance the only gadgets the spy is gifted are a new firearm and a Geiger counter. Bond is a rake, lionized, and with that descriptor follows every vice: smoking, drinking, gambling - womanizing. His behavior in 'Dr. No' is boorish and deserving of some rolling of eyes, but it's less aggressively sexist and more an annoying pretense of suave machismo. The silliness that took over action sequences and plot points in later entries is substantially downplayed here, to the point that it's not even particularly notable.Specific to the crafting of this film, the most glaring flaw in my mind is, unfortunately, the music. Don't get me wrong, Monty Norman's theme is classic - few musical cues are as recognizable, or have as much cultural heft, as James Bond's theme. But, presumably under Terence Young's direction, that theme gets used, and overused, and abused in 'Dr. No'... then used more, and used again - as though it were the only piece of music available. The theme is played to a kitschy effect in later movies, but that unfortunate filmmaking choice began here, from the very start.Putting these things aside, though, and focusing on the most essential aspects of the feature: 'Dr. No' is fantastic. Well before he became just another action hero, James Bond here is depicted in a much more low-key fashion. He says as much himself at one point, referring to himself as simply a detective. For all the beatings Bond takes throughout his films, this feels like the only instance where he is allowed to be fully human, and show physical vulnerability, as exemplified in the scene where he has to wrap his hands in cloth to keep them from getting burned in a hot metal pipe.The narrative flow itself is likewise far more restrained, and suspenseful moments and action sequences feel more natural and organic - as opposed to the bombastic crescendo of frenzied conflict that later entries revel in. As Bond sleuths about, picking up the trail of a disappeared MI6 agent, there are multiple attempts on his life - but no major gunfight, no skydiving or cliff-jumping, no explosions except at the very end. There's nothing inherently wrong with these things of course, and it's a question of how they're used in a picture, but honestly, the simpler formula of 'Dr. No' is refreshing to revisit.Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress) is almost inarguably the single most iconic ""Bond girl"" of the series. She lends an air of innocence to the picture, and thankfully the character isn't written as poorly as others in the franchise. It's also unfortunate, though, that Ryder simply isn't given much agency in this film; she really is little more than a pretty face for Bond to save.More impressive is the visage of Dr. No, portrayed with a cold, hard demeanor by the great Joseph Wiseman. Putting aside the regrettable casting choice of a Canadian-American for the role of a German-Chinese scientist, Wiseman's performance is outstanding, if limited by little time on screen. He set a high standard for Bond villains and their actors, and wholly embodied the trope of the mad scientist. Of course, No's scheme doesn't seem particularly noteworthy, though perhaps it would have been more monumental in the early 1960s as the space race sped up. Still, for that matter, the relatively subdued nature of the plot again echoes the flavor of the feature generally - and moreover, the minor demonstration of power sets up the conflict with SPECTRE for future movies.Viewers looking for an action film like 'GoldenEye' or 'Licence to Kill' may find 'Dr. No' wanting, even though the same tropes are utilized here, if not as much. At the same time, not one other Bond film is likely to appeal to a general audience as much as this, as the series quickly took on a more ""genre picture"" feel. Such variations aside, this movie still stands firmly on its own legs and remains one of the strongest entries in the franchise: After 2 dozen sequels, the staying power of 'Dr. No' speaks volumes.",Dr. No
105,Spondonman,Enjoyable megalomanic atomic romp,7,22 September 2012,"To me the true first edition of James Bond at the movies, it's now half the age of the Titanic and catching up. Neither has yet sunk without trace. I saw the series at the pictures and to repeat that well worn phrase ""There was only one 007"": Sean Connery, rising star of the '50's and refugee from a collapsing Tarzan film empire was the only one who seemed to understand what was required of him in the role. By the late 1970's I wanted less of Moore, and I believe someone even took over the character from him later and is still filming Bond to this day, but I could be wrong. The films contained just the right mix of fluffiness and intelligence, of action and smooch, of stereotypes and surprises and of corn and wit to keep everyone fairly happy.Suave British agent James Bond is sent to Jamaica to find out what happened to previous British agent who had disappeared. And who is never found either. Bond uses his incredible powers of guesswork to pinpoint the culprit and the island he inhabits, and embarks on a seemingly carefree escapade with the ultimate aim of saving America's space programme from a terribly atomic but unspecified fate. He willingly meets many willing ladies on the way including Ursula Andress in her famous bikini – when I saw it at 7 years old it wasn't my favourite scene, I wonder why? Bond had a license to kill and also to copulate, gamble, smoke and booze endlessly and effortlessly without effects or qualms; what a guy! Thank goodness it's only fiction and it never happens in real life. Check out Hammer's Hound Of The Baskervilles for spider-despatching similarities.Very enjoyable - I hadn't seen Dr. No for over 30 years until tonight; it's colourful, bright and breezy entertainment, definitely pre-digital, pre-franchise and well made hokum.",Dr. No
106,davidmvining,Establishes the formula,6,17 January 2020,"I think this is a movie that people grade on a curve. In the alternate universe where we don't have several dozen James Bond movies and the entire franchise ended at Dr. No, the movie would be seen as a mystery with little mystery centered around a rather dull and thin antagonist. As the first real James Bond movie, though, it's heralded as the originator of most of the cinematic mythos including the theme song, ""Bond, James Bond,"" ""shaken, no stirred,"" Bond girls, Sean Connery as Bond, S.P.E.C.T.R.E., and several other well-worn things. On its own, though, I was a slightly bored.We're told near the beginning of the film why the bad things are happening in Jamaica. Someone, we're not supposed to know who (despite seeing a file titled ""Doctor No"" stolen earlier and the title of the film being Dr. No), is trying to interfere with the American Mercury program in Cape Canaveral. There's something about radar jamming that will interfere with the rockets' telemetry. We find out later that yes, this is exactly what the bad guy's plan is.Doctor No himself is spoken of a good bit of the film until he's introduced in the final thirty minutes, but nothing's ever really said of him. He's just a mysterious person living on an island off of Jamaica called Crab Key. When he's introduced, we get a vaguely looking Oriental man who's, he explains, half-German and half-Chinese. He explains his backstory very quickly, mostly about how he stole $10 million from a Chinese gangster organization in order to fund his operation in Jamaica, and then he runs off to execute the final stages of his plan. I think there's a reason Doctor No is rarely talked about when it comes to the great Bond villains. It's not that he's terrible, but that he's pretty bland.Outside of those two rather large elements, the movie is quite entertaining. Connery hits the ground running as Bond. He's suave, intelligent, and lethal all at once. From the moment he's introduced playing baccarat and says the signature line, he just feels like a super spy (who tells everyone his name). The movie is a bit more of a detective story (even going so far as for someone to call Bond a detective at one point), so the emphasis isn't on action (which isn't great), it's on tension. And there are several moments of quality tension peppered throughout the film like when Bond and Honey Rider are hiding in the lagoon on Crab Key, waiting for Dr. No's henchmen to pass by.The movie also simply looks good. It's not a visual showcase (though the 4K restoration on Amazon Prime is a revelation on its own), but it's classically filmed with strong mise-en-scene that keeps the players in frame clear. Bond moves through the images with authority and verve, demanding attention on the screen. The technical aspects of the film are also quite fun, especially set design and the first ridiculous Bond villain layer complete with 5-star room service.The good stuff is a bit of a hodgepodge while the bad stuff is what really is supposed to drive the story. I feel rather mixed on Bond's first adventure, though there's obvious reason to understand why it was an initial success as well as how the iconic moments later became iconic (mostly through repetition).",Dr. No
107,Spleen,"Not without teething problems, but one of the great Bonds",8,15 October 1999,"Dr. No's nuclear reactor has to be seen to be believed.  It's a swimming pool.  Just below the surface of the swimming pool are some rods of uranium or plutonium or whatever that glow and cause the water to bubble alarmingly in moments of crisis.  The workers are protected from the radiation by two inches of water and two MILLIMETRES of aluminium foil.  If this doesn't make you feel nervous, nothing will.  Granted, there are no babes in bikinis by the sides of the pool, but that's because Ursula Andress is in another room: I kept expecting to see her.Still, there's a certain realism to this Bond adventure which is missing in, say, the 1980s, when the technology was more slick.  When Bond escapes, it looks as if he was in genuine danger of being nuked; and when he escapes through the tunnels, it looks as if those metal rims really HURT.  To this day I feel a sympathetic twitch in my palms.  Plus there's all that water, possibly radioactive water ...I won't say much about the quality of this movie.  Either you're able to partake in the Bond ethos, or you aren't.  If you are you'll notice that a few things are missing.  Bond only gets one woman, not three (watch from `Goldfinger' on and you'll discover that `Bond gets three girls' is a cast-iron rule, broken, so far as I can recall, only once); the `dancing naked chicks' thing is missing from the beginning; and the establishing bit of action does not feature Bond himself.  (Help - the sky is falling.) Still, the REAL essentials are there, beginning with James Bond.  Let me give you a few facts, free of charge:(1)  Whales are mammals.(2)  Sean Connery is the best James Bond that ever was.(3)  The sun is powered by nuclear fusion.(4)  Sean Connery is the best James Bond that ever will be.(5)  Ludwig van Beethoven died in 1827.I give these facts in descending order of likelihood.  If you're inclined to doubt any of them, with the possible exception of #5, then I'm afraid you're one of the damned, and there's no hope for you.For my money, Connery is at his best here.  He begins by looking just the slightest bit sheepish and uncertain in M's office, coming to life only later, when that life is threatened, and convincingly claws his way through adversity at the end.  If you liked the wolf-in-a-tuxedo Bond, and liked him best of all when he wasn't even in a tuxedo, you'll like this.",Dr. No

109,Kingslaay,A great start to the greatest film series of all time,8,29 March 2017,"Dr No was the first (Eon Production) film adaptation of Ian Fleming's James Bond in 1962. It showcased the great 007 investigating the disappearance of a fellow agent. Dr No is great in introducing the key elements that would characterize a classic Bond film. From the gun barrel sequence, bond girl, soundtrack, master villain to overcoming great odds. Sean Connery is iconic in his portrayal as 007 and cementing himself as the greatest James Bond. We see the Bond many love, someone who is rugged, resourceful, composed, calm, smooth, ruthless, has human limitations and charm to top it off. The mystery around Dr No adds to the suspense as 007 finally makes his way to the island. A Bond film is also as strong as its villain and plot. Dr No is captivating as a master villain that only Bond can take on to stop his evil plans. Connery's way of dealing with the villain, henchman and chemistry with the Bond girl created the perfect formula for a truly great film. This film is also famous for showing the first great entrance of the Bond girl, Ursula Andress, turn heads of many including Bond himself. The Bond girl is a key part of the franchise and in many ways she is Bond's equal. Films over time have noted that the Bond girl is 007's weakness. When Bond manages to defeat the great Dr No, rescue the mission and land up with the Bond girl it set the groundwork for many memorable films to follow. The only issue is sometimes the difficulty in understanding the plot as the majority of stories are based on Fleming's own experiences in the Navy and involve complex schemes. Once you understand it, the journey is enjoyable. Dr No was indeed a great start to an iconic film series that continues to entertain.",Dr. No
110,Rob_Taylor,Much more enjoyable than some of the recent Bond outings.,6,24 May 2003,"Watching this today is quite an eye-opener. As someone who enjoys Bond films but doesn't consider themselves a fan of the franchise, it's interesting to go back to the early films and see where the series' roots are.Of course, some elements of the story - perfectly reasonable in their day, bring a smile now, and the undeniable 60's credits at the start made me wonder if I'd made a mistake in watching this. But it's all harmless good fun.Of course, there are a few ""hmmm"" moments, which no doubt went unnoticed by the less sophisticated audiences of the day, such as the bad guys winding reactor rods INTO the reactor in order to increase power output. And the dialogue gaff (twice) where the controller refers to ""convectors"" and the guy operating them calls them ""convertors"".But harmless fun nonetheless and much more enjoyable than some of the more recent Bond outings.",Dr. No
111,lewiskendell,The first Bond is still a fun watch.,7,8 July 2010,"""Minnows pretending they're whales. Just like you on this island, Dr. No."" The foundations for the later Bond films are all here in Dr. No. Beautiful, dangerous women, car chases, exotic locations, and a suave James Bond who deftly maneuvers through it all with a cool head and an expensive suit. Dr. No has a slower pace than modern Bond movies, but that just allows for more time to salivate over the gorgeous Honey Rider once she is introduced. The finale in the island base reminded me so much of an Austin Powers movie, which goes to show what a good job that series did in spoofing the early Bond movies.Classic Bond can be quite an adjustment, if you were weaned on the more exciting and technologically advanced Brosnan movies like I was. However, if you watch Dr. No with an open mind, you will find it too has much of what makes the later movies appealing.",Dr. No
112,screenman,First Is Worst?,5,17 October 2010,"Arriving on the cusp of those swinging 60's came the first of Ian Fleming's 007 escapades brought to screen. To say that its budget was limited is an understatement. You can see why the recently deceased Norman Wisdom knocked it off top-spot in Britain.But this is the movie that set a formula which was to typify all subsequent offerings.Bond is played by the inimitable Sean Connery. And he almost carries this hokum on his back. An actor with less charisma might well have caused the franchise to end here. Though there's actually a very good supporting cast; with Bernard Lee, Ursula Andress and John Lord - he would later go on to star in the popular TV series 'Hawai 5-0'.A sinister, secretive megalomaniac is hatching some wicked plot to destabilise the political world, and our man has got to track him down and stop him. This is a pre-gadgets Bond. The very things that would become a benchmark for the franchise are markedly absent first outing. He gets to drive a very ordinary Sunbeam Alpine 'sports' car; no machine-gun toting, passenger-ejecting Aston Martin yet. The whole thing is like a slick gumshoe plot. Straightforward car chases, slayings by gun, and a dodgy femme-fatale. Mike Hammer or Philip Marlowe might as easily fit the bill with more grit and tension. But this is not film-noir.The nearest we get to exotic creepiness is the spider-in-the-bed sequence. In the book; it was a giant centipede. Though neither would have been fatal. And it's obvious that the spider was superimposed on Mr Connery's shoulder.The megalomaniac kills anyone who crosses him up or fails him. But not Bond, James Bond. No - setting a behavioural standard that would ultimately become a laughable parody - instead of killing his arch enemy and greatest nemesis, he takes him prisoner, discloses all of his plans, and then imprisons him from where he can escape and screw 'em all up.Ursula Andress - and indeed this movie - is largely remembered for her emerging-from-the water-in-a-bikini routine. In 1962 that was considered risqué. How times and sensibilities have altered.The Bond franchise got more money and more gadgets thrown at it and eventually outgrew Norman Wisdom and much else. In time it went on to be the standard-bearer of suave, sophisticated action movie. Even today, after more reincarnations than 'Dr Who', it still holds its own in the genre.But when you see this lacklustre first outing, you do incline to wonder how.",Dr. No
113,brando647,James Bond 007 Arrives and a Legendary Series is Born,8,6 February 2013,"Here is where it all began for 007. DR. NO is the first film in the James Bond series and introduced the world to a character who would go on to spawn one of the most successful franchises in film history. I had only seen DR. NO once a long time ago when TBS would run their annual 007 marathons I remembered little about it, so I figured it was time to reacquaint myself with it (and the rest of the series). The first 007 movie is actually better than I originally remember. I'm sure it's because I was in my teens and, unless a Bond movie feature a gimmicky villain and an abundance of action with clever gadgets, I wasn't interested. DR. NO is a great film in that it came before the franchise turned to camp and novelty to draw its audience. No, better yet: DR. NO is an actual spy film. The film opens with the murder of a British agent and his secretary in Jamaica. The agent, Strangways, has been investigating allegations from the Americans that a signal has been emanating from the region that interferes with their missile launches. With a moon-orbit mission launch on the horizon, it is vital that the source of the signal is discovered. Enter James Bond, agent 007 of the British Secret Service. He travels to Jamaica and teams with CIA agent Felix Leiter and local fisherman Quarrel to gather information on the mysterious Dr. No and his base of operations on Crab Key.What I love most about DR. NO and the second film, FROM Russia WITH LOVE, is that they feel the most like genuine espionage films. The majority of the film is 007's investigation into the death of Strangways and the missile-toppling signal. The action scenes are, for the most part, small and brutal. Fist fights and an occasional shootout, with only a single major action sequence in the end of the film. At this point, Bond isn't a renowned action hero and spends more time determining friend from foe than gunning down henchmen and making spectacular escapes from dangerous situations. The first film is completely devoid of the usual gadgets we've come to associate with the franchise, though Q does make an appearance. This Q isn't yet Desmond Llewelyn, who would go on to inhabit the role in the next film and continue until 1999. Major Boothroyd (Q's real name) is instead portrayed in this one film by Peter Burton and the only device he provides 007 is his brand new Walther PPK. No laser watches or hidden transmitters in this movie. DR. NO is much more grounded without all the craziness. As I mentioned, I love that this film follows Bond on his mission, learning of his enemy bit by bit and dodging assassins at every turn. We don't even meet our villain face-to-face, the titular Dr. No, until the final act of the film. Being a Bond movie, our villain has a quirk to make him a bit more threatening: metal hands. A genius nuclear physicist, he is a man of evil intentions who wants to remind the world that shunned him of his power. Dr. No is played by Robert Wiseman, who gives the villain an unnerving calm demeanor while carrying a major chip on his shoulder. He's not amused with 007 antics but he won't let the agents interference deter him from his master plan.DR. NO introduces us to most of the conventions that would become commonplace in the series. Bernard Lee is the first (and arguably the best) M, and Lois Maxwell's Moneypenny adorable flirtations with 007 are here from the start. Of course, the movie also introduces the concept of SPECTRE. SPECTRE, an evil organization intent on world domination, will become Bond's #1 enemy over the course of the Connery films and, despite disappearing from the films in 1973, establishes themselves as the most iconic of Bond's adversaries. DR. NO also features one of the most legendary Bond women in the entire series: Ursula Andress as Honey Rider. The shot of Rider rises from the ocean water in her white bikini with a knife at her side is an image that defined the role of Bond women in the future: beautiful and exotic with a hint of danger. Andress is absolutely gorgeous and set a standard for the women in 007's life. This is, of course, Sean Connery's first time filling the shoes of James Bond but you'd think he'd been doing it for years. He's a natural and, with guidance from director Terrence Young, made Bond what he is today.The film holds up incredibly well despite having been released fifty years ago. The exotic locations and set design are fantastic, and the plot is engaging even when it slows down. There is a bit of dragging in the middle of the film but it picks right back up when Bond and Quarrel arrive at Crab Key, which soon culminates in the reveal of our main villain. DR. NO might not grab some people as a great 007 film because it came at a time when there was less camp and more espionage, but I respect it for being a fun thriller and jump-starting one of my favorite series.",Dr. No
114,Gislef,Still Holds Its Own,7,7 December 1998,"Doctor No tends to please on all fronts.  It's fairly loyal to the original Fleming novel, but also has a lot of the gimmickry (mostly on the villain's part - Bond himself has nothing), big budget wrap-ups (as No's HQ blows up), major charismatic villain, and ""rule-the-world"" global-scale plot that would dominate the later Bond flicks.  This is Connery at his most ruthless, as he casually shoots down Professor Dent without a blink or a one-liner.  There are a few glitches (why _does_ No put Bond in the relatively innocuous ""death tunnel,"" particularly when its exit conveniently leads back into the complex?).

Starring Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, John Kitzmiller, Joseph Wiseman, Jack Lord, Anthony Dawson, Zena Marshall, Eunice Gayson, Louis Blaazer, Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell, Peter Burton. (PG)First cinematic James Bond outing is one of the better efforts; more low-key and less fantastical than average, though not without its fair share of thrills. 007 travels to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a British agent, uncovers the nefarious plot of a Chinese-German criminal mastermind named Dr. No (Wiseman). At its best during the first hour before Bond gets to the villain's island, economically establishing the character's intelligence, sophistication, womanizing and ruthlessness. A terrific showcase for Ken Adam's trend-setting set design, specifically Dr. No's lair, not to mention the introduction of the iconic ""James Bond Theme"" by John Barry and Monty Norman. Offscreen until the final twenty minutes, Wiseman sets the standard for supervillains to come; Andress' ""Bond girl"" is a bit too bland and passive, only memorable for her looks, especially her striking entrance. Not the best place to start for those looking for the large-scale action, gimmicks and special effects the series eventually became known for, but it remains an above-average spy adventure regardless of its character's legacy. Unlike most other Bond movies, this one actually follows the book fairly well (and is possibly the only time that the literary source was actually more outlandish than the version on screen--in the novel, 007 even battles a giant squid at one point). M (Lee) and Moneypenny (Maxwell) both make brief appearances, but Q is only referred to as an armorer named Boothroyd (played by Burton instead of Desmond Llewelyn).81/100",Dr. No
116,shakercoola,The spy film genre as fantasy is born,7,5 June 2018,"A British spy fantasy; A story about James Bond of the secret department of the British Secret Service, who investigates the murder in Jamaica of a fellow agent and comes up against a criminal mastermind.
Director Terence Young prepared Sean Connery well for the part, coaching him on gentleman comportment that would satisfy readers of the Ian Fleming novels. Connery plays the elegant playboy spy impeccably. With his racing snake figure and panther-lithe movement, he captures the assertiveness of OO7: Navy-like exactness and the mien of a cool, suave, womanising agent. Bernard Lee captures the Vice-Admiral pitch perfect too - a naval martinet who is loyal to Bond but keeps him at arms length, and on his toes.
The story is tongue-in-cheek hokum, but it has good pace and is a well-conceived dose of escapism. Where other films in the series boast elaborate ordnance and eye-popping gadgetry, Dr No is a unselfconscious and a straight forward detective story that avoids an over-reliance on hardware and elitism.
The stylish bauhaus set design looks very impressive in the large set spaces and the travelogue locations of exotic locales are impressive too. John Barry's musical score is superb.",Dr. No

James Bond, a series that has proved to be so successful it is it's own genre in the world of film.There is something magnetic about the character that has seen many incarnations over the years, but it's hard to argue that Sean Connery set the bar pretty high for all that followed him in the role.Dr. No in my opinion is not the best of the Bond movies, but it does lay the ground work for 4 and 1/2 decades of Bond antics, for us all to love, scrutinise, compare and debate over.What Dr. No lacks in action and gadgets, it makes up for in more subtle ways. The opening of the movie is paced nicely; building up to the first glimpse of our favourite spy, when he delivers the now immortal words - ""Bond, James Bond"". The story continues at a steady and believable pace throughout, with very few wasted moments.It's the original Bond, in the original movie, from this period on it became a real roller-coaster ride, with some great highs and some poor lows, but Dr. No is definitely in the higher bracket, even if it has begun to show its age.7/10",Dr. No
118,sme_no_densetsu,"""Bond. James Bond.""",8,2 August 2009,"With those immortal words we are introduced to British super-spy James Bond in the form of Sean Connery. In this, the first of more than twenty Bond films to date, he sets his wits against the title character, a villain shrouded in mystery with plans of severely disrupting the U.S. space program. Bond's mission takes him to sunny Jamaica, where he meets an assortment of interesting characters, some more welcoming than others.Connery is basically the Bond by which all other Bonds are measured, so it should come as no surprise that his performance here is up to par. That being said, at this early stage his take on the character isn't quite as refined as it would become in subsequent films. The movie's female lead, Ursula Andress, is routinely singled out as one of the best Bond girls of all time despite the fact that her dialogue was dubbed by another actress. Admittedly, the dubbing is well done and Andress has undeniable sex appeal. Meanwhile, we get memorable support from Joseph Wiseman, Anthony Dawson & Jack Lord, among others, including our introductions to recurring characters M (Bernard Lee) & Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell).The script is full of the usual twists and turns that we've come to expect from an espionage thriller. The movie may not be as bombastic as later entries in the franchise but there's something fresh and appealing about its relative simplicity. On the technical side, the direction by Terence Young is nicely handled and the vibrant Technicolor makes for plenty of luscious visuals. The film also introduces the iconic Bond theme in the opening credits while mixing in music with a Jamaican flavour from time to time as well.In conclusion, whether you're a Bond fan or just a fan of action films in general you shouldn't miss out on Bond's first outing. It may seem a bit quaint today given the franchise's later excesses but it still has all of the ingredients that have made the series such a success for over 50 years.",Dr. No

In its day Connery's depiction was turning point in the portrayal of male sex appeal in UK films, and the appearance of Ursula Undress, sorry Andress, does the same for women, especially with that iconic scene where she appears from the sea in that bikini which has Connery breaking into a tune.The story -Bond is sent to Jamaica to find out more about the mysterious killing of a fellow agent. With the help of CIA man Felix Leiter, he discovers the evil Dr No's plan to hold the United States to ransom by threatening its space programme.The pace is a bit stodgy in places, especially in the first half, where Bond is snooping around and investigating, but is much more fluid in the second half, especially when Bond and Honey Ryder meet up. The atmosphere is generally tense, a sense of quietness between ( that's the air of kitchen sink drama lingering), the location is exotic and action quite gritty. The treacherous professor's death at 007's silencer is quite hard hitting. Joseph Wiseman as the title character is a scene stealer though he only appears in the last twenty minutes.

The plight of the sightless is concurrently mocked by a crude cartoon (which morphs into the ludicrous live action dance of a Jamaican serial killing trio who accept ""alms for the poor,"" and then gun down their Good Samaritan moments later), and made into just another reason to hate those perceived as ""different"" due to the loss of senses or limbs. Therefore, the first lesson of the Bond franchise is Don't Support Charity; Distrust the Poor & Weak. Sean Connery as James Bond then launches into his own serial killing spree against all of those he views as destitute weaklings incapable of confronting a nuclear terrorist in the mode of Gary Cooper facing the HIGH NOON bad guys. Finally, Bond belittles a scientist who's lost two limbs to cutting edge research, and uses his able-bodied status to literally melt this man to death. DR.

123,frankde-jong,A pleasant introduction to the James Bond genre,7,17 September 2021,"Already a filmbuff for 30 years, I didn't see a single James Bond movie. In september 2021 a channel on Dutch television programmed all James Bond films, so I decided it was time to watch at least a few of them. Before I write a review I usually check the opinion of some critics I have learned to appreciate, checking if and why their remarks differs from mine. Writing the James Bond reviews I noticed that also these critics had the habit of circumventing the James Bond movies.I chose the oldest three Bond movies. In the first place because lovers of the James Bond genre generally prefer Sean Connory, in the second place the IMDB ratings of the first three movies are well above average. This is rather remarkable because the production budget rose from approximately 1 million dollar for ""Dr No"" (1962) to 250 million dollar for ""No time to die"" (2021). Of course inflation explains part of the difference, but it once again proofs that money does not guarantee quality.James Bond is a typical English gentleman but the stories are also vaguely related to the Cold War. All the novels were written during this period. The relation to the Cold War is however quite different from the science fiction movies of the '50s. In these science fiction movies the aliens invariably stand for the Russians and the relationship is fear. In James Bond movies the Russians are not always the bad guys (the criminal organisation SPECTRE is the representation of all evil) but the emphasis on secret service unmistakably has some Cold War flavour. Also the relationship is not fear but action and thril.The James Bond franchise is all about: the bad guy, the Bond girl, the location and the gadgets. The films are meant for entertainment, so don't expect deep motives. I shall therefore review the individual Bond movies according to the above mentioned elements.In ""Dr No"" (1962) the bad guy is a Chinese who, with the aid of a nuclear reactor, wants to influence the orbit of a missile. It is totally unclear what his interest is in doing so, so the plot is based on a pure Hitchcockian MacGuffin. Amazing to me was the nonchalant way in which the film treats nuclear contamination. One good shower and the problem is solved. In the year of the Cuba crisis you would expect a less relaxed attitude.Ursula Andress is the Bond girl, and she is immediately one of the most high profile of all the Bond girls after her. The location is the island of Jamaica. The native character of Quarrel is portraited as a little superstitious. I think that would be done a little different when there would be a remake in 2021. Gadgets are almost absent in this first James Bond movie. All in all ""Dr No"" is a pleasant introduction to the genre.",Dr. No
124,Sirus_the_Virus,An overrated Bond film.,7,9 September 2009,"I think that the original James Bond film, Dr. No, is overrated. I don't think it is the worst but it's not the best. I have the same problem with this film as I do with Tim Burton's Batman. It's kind of a snoozer. The Bond films got better as they went on but I was not a fan of the original Bond film. I liked it but I had a few problems with it. As I already said before, it is a bit of a snoozer compared to some of the other films. There isn't enough excitement. Also, I am still not quite sure what the plot of the film is. Like I am with a lot of James Bond films. I don't know it's just that with some of them they don't really state what exactly it's about. I have seen the film a few times and I am still unaware of the plot. I liked the film, I give it a thumbs up, but I think it's overrated and flawed. I am being too harsh, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.Dr. No:***/****",Dr. No
125,jeremycrimsonfox,The Movie That Started It All,8,9 March 2019,"Dr. No is the movie that would kick off the long running James Bond film series. Based on the sixth book in the series (while Casino Royale was the first, copyright issues kept it from being made until 2006, and Thunderball was planned, but due to conflict between the screenplay's co-author and Ian Flemming, the author of the James Bond books), this movie sees James Bond (played by Sean Connery) head to Jamaica when he is given a mission to investigate the disappearance of MI6 Station Chief Strangways, who was killed in an ambush by three assassins. Teaming up with CIA agent Felix Leiter, Bond has to stop the evil Dr. No, a scientist who is aiming to disrupt Project Mercury launch.This was a good start. Made in an era long before CGI was created, you can tell a lot of effort was put into this, despite the film's small budget of just $1.1 million. Yes, it does have some violent and disturbing moments (one scene has a character killed by a tank equipped with a flamethrower), but the movie has some good acting and action scenes. Sean, despite being Scottish, does a good job playing 007, and this film is a must watch for all Bond fans.",Dr. No
126,classicalsteve,The First Bond Film Installment Is a Decent Introduction to the Series,7,20 February 2016,"""Dr. No"" is a decent first installment into one of the most popular film series of all-time, although ""Dr. No"" was not the first book of the James Bonds series by Ian Fleming but the sixth. (Casino Royale was the first James Bond book published in 1953.) The film has many of the plot-devices which further installments would utilize; they would become almost trademarks of nearly all the films. These include among other things a baddie of high-intellect, the baddie's lair replete with henchmen, the obligatory scene in which Bond is invited to tea and/or dinner with the baddie, and of course all the beautiful women Bond encounters on his exploits. This installment is certainly far from the best but it is a largely entertaining entry replete with a mysterious crime organization, beautiful women caught in the crossfire, some chase scenes, and yet more beautiful women caught in the crossfire. Interestingly, the book Dr. No which was released in 1958 was given some of the most critical reviews of the Bond series to date, although it became one of the most successful installments, particularly because of the release of this film.A British intelligence operative, code-named Strangways, and his female assistant are assassinated in Jamaica via the ""Three Blind Mice"", hired assassins who appear harmless with their canes. Strangways and his associate had been monitoring an underground crime organization which has a habit of disrupting rocket testing in the United States, but the Western Allies don't know how they're able to make the US Nasa program look like a bad episode of Flash Gordon. James Bond, Agent 007 (Sean Connery), is summoned by British Intelligence to look into the matter. Just before his summons, he is introduced for the first time at a casino in one of the most famous scenes in the history of the series.Bond arrives in Jamaica and confronted by some henchmen who turn out to be working for CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord). When they realize they are on the same side, they begin searching for clues about this crime organization. Along the way, they stumble upon a variety of operatives who not only work for this organization but are so loyal they are willing to give up their lives. Their investigation leads them to the so-called Crab Keys islands. Bond and his assistant journey to the island and meet a frequent visitor to the island, Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress) who is constantly looking for valuable sea-shells. She also describes a ""dragon"" on the island with glowing eyes and bad breath in the form of fire. Bond realizes the ""dragon"" smells of diesel fuel so he doesn't have as much in common with Smaug the Dragon of Lord of the Rings fame as Honey lets on. Eventually the ""dragon"" and its ""drivers"" capture the two of them.They are led into an underground lair presided over by the title character Dr. No, a cross between Fu Manchu, Albert Einstein, and Richard Nixon. He's a good baddie, never yelling but wields his power with unquestioned instantaneous responses, especially from his female underlings who run around with smiles on their faces. Bond and Honey are given accommodations which would give the Hilton a run for its money. Eventually they meet Mr Baddie, er Dr. No, and of course the doctor is displeased with Bond, accusing him of being no more than a mere policeman for the Western powers. During the scene, Bond notices the Portrait of the Duke of Wellington by Goya (1812-14), the real painting having been stolen in 1961. This moment from the film, a kind of inside joke pertaining to real-life events, would fuel the erroneous notion that old master paintings were often stolen for rich underworld kingpins.Overall an enjoyable film, with the most compelling scenes having to do with the investigation by Connery and Lord. The final denouement at the end was a little bit of a let-down considering the length and breadth needed to finally arrive at the baddie's lair. In short, it seemed a bit too easy for Bond to accomplish his task and bring down Dr. No. However, that being said, it's still a must for fans of the series especially if they haven't seen this installment. Prior to the recent offerings starring Daniel Craig, Sean Connery was the most compelling and interesting James Bond.",Dr. No
127,hall895,You have to start somewhere,5,23 February 2010,"The James Bond franchise is one of the most successful and lucrative in film history. When you look back on Bond's first film salvo, Dr. No, it is a little hard to imagine that all that success would follow down the decades. Because truth be told this is not a very good movie. It may work as a nostalgia trip, as a bit of film history. There is an undeniable curiosity to seeing the first Bond film. Watching this film may satisfy that curiosity but that's about it. If you ignore the billion-dollar franchise it spawned and take the film on its own merits Dr. No just doesn't work.Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is that the story is incredibly simple and not particularly interesting. Our villain, Dr. No, is, from his Jamaican lair, using radio waves to jam American rockets. If this doesn't strike you as being that big a deal you're right. There's very little sense of drama here. Bond villains in films to come had grand plans with undeniable high stakes. This villainous plan, and the villain himself, come off as a bit of a dud. So, lacking that drama any good movie needs, the movie slogs along towards its finish. There are some good moments sprinkled throughout. But in this case good moments do not a good movie make. And in the end comes a big letdown. Because for all its failings you hold out hope throughout that perhaps the movie will at least have a smashing conclusion. But sadly that is not to be. The big climactic final scene is more farcical than powerful. It all comes off as being a little silly. And silly is not really the effect you're looking for in a James Bond movie.Yes, Sean Connery is a terrific James Bond. And it is interesting to see so many Bond firsts. There's the first appearance of that now so familiar musical theme. The first appearances of characters we would come to know and love in the films to follow. The first ""Bond, James Bond."" The first shaken martini. The first Bond girls, with bonus points for the famously memorable way in which Ursula Andress, as Honey Ryder, is introduced in the film. And so many other firsts, too numerous to mention. So go ahead and watch Dr. No for its place in film history, for the nostalgia trip it provides. And then go watch a better James Bond movie.",Dr. No
128,Beta_Gallinger,A decent first effort to bring James Bond to the silver screen,7,9 June 2008,"Many James Bond films have been made over the past few decades, with different actors assuming the role of Ian Fleming's character, but this 1962 film, starring Sean Connery (who continued in the role for the next several films), was the first theatrical one of them all. This one came out 24 years before I was born, but I first saw it back in 1999 on TV. It was the first James Bond film I watched from start to finish, and I don't recall loving it, but I guess I found it entertaining and memorable enough, even though I couldn't remember the title. Years later, with a second viewing, I still found that it was a reasonable romp.English secret agent James Bond (007) is sent on a mission to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of fellow agents who have been assassinated on the tropical island! In Jamaica, he faces a number dangers during his investigation, and is joined by Quarrel and CIA agent Felix Leiter. It turns out that an evil scientist with plans for world domination named Dr. No is Bond's main foe on this mission, and the secret agent must find the headquarters of this man, which is on a nearby island called Crab Key. After his arrival on this island, Bond soon meets a shell collector named Honey Ryder, and quickly falls in love. Ryder becomes another assistant in Bond's mission, as they bravely search the dangerous island for the terrorist's lair! I haven't read any of the books, so I don't know how this adaptation of ""Dr. No"" compares to the novel. However, judging it simply as a film, it has its merits. It didn't keep me consistently entertained throughout, sometimes due to the pacing and sometimes due to other flaws, but there certainly are some intense moments (usually action scenes), and there was enough suspense to keep me watching, even though I had seen the movie before and knew what would happen. Although Connery is now well past his Bond days, he is still well known for the role, and having seen him in it, I can see why. His version of the character is unforgettable. Also, I know many guys have said this before, but being a straight male, seeing Ursula Andress, who plays Honey Ryder in this film, in a bikini was a highlight for me, and I think the tropical beach setting for the scene where she comes in helped.This first Bond film may be a bit dated in some ways, and probably can't have the same appeal as it did upon its original release 46 years ago, but overall, it's still reasonable, and clearly still has appeal among today's audiences after all these decades, and after many more Bond films. If you want non-stop action, you won't find it here, so if you need it in order to be entertained by a spy thriller, then you'll likely find ""Dr. No"" very boring and probably very unmemorable as well. However, if you can enjoy a slower film of this kind, with a reasonable amount of action, this Bond film that started it all is probably worth watching. Even if it doesn't blow you away (it didn't do that for me), it could still easily have enough to keep you from stopping the film early.",Dr. No
129,vip_ebriega,The first great step to a larger work for Bond.,7,14 May 2008,"My Take: First of the Bond movies is a delightful and nostalgic trip. DR. NO, released in 1962, is the first James Bond movie, and the film that jump-started Sean Connery's career as the suave British secret agent no. 007. It's also the first time we here the famous line ""Bond, James Bond"". Although it appears in every Bond film since then, seeing it here as the first time, is memorable. Due to the overall success that Bond has achieved through the years with one Bond blockbuster after another, DR. NO has either become dated or ""too old"". The action scenes are no longer as exciting, and there are not much in abundance. Still, there's Connery, debuting as Bond, and that's what makes real Bond movies, right? Bond's first mission is not as flashy nor as thrillingly dangerous as later films, but it's classic Bond movie plot where he goes up against an evil megalomaniac, the metal-handed Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), who wants to rule the world. The character of Dr. No is still an inspiration for a great villain. Then there's Ursula Andress and her famous character, Honey Ryder, emerging from the sea in a famous scene with her white bikini, which is still very memorable to date.Director Terence Young, a veteran Bond director shot the film in a beautiful and lush tropical setting which is appropriate. The acting is adequate, with Connery, of course, holding our attention the most. The script is in the spirit of the great spy thrillers. Although not everything about this film holds up, it's still a great film and a fine step to a larger work. A worthy curio for every Bond film fan or any film enthusiast or simply anyone who wants to watch it.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Dr. No
130,one9eighty,Dr Yes please,7,7 July 2020,"Based on novels by Ian Fleming, directed by Terence Young, ""Dr No"" is the first James Bond film committed to film. Starring Sean Connery, the plot follows British super-spy James Bond as he tries to uncover how a fellow agent was killed in Jamaica, which eventually leads him to the mysterious Dr No who has evil in mind. This is the story of how a highly trained operative functions when thrown into a mystery situation when there is not much information to go on and apparently everyone is standing in his way, if not trying to kill him.If you have seen any of the other Bond films this one will surely stand out as a simpler version, with no over the top explosions and effects, no random gadgets to save the day, no complicated twists and turns to keep the audience guessing. It is simpler in its approach and yet its more detailed due to its simplicity. The film is character driven and relies on intelligence to push forward, making it more mysterious and thrilling as a result. It relies on reality to solve the day, which is not something that stayed with the franchise later on. As an example, when securing his room Bond uses talcum powder on his briefcase and human hair on his cupboard door, all just to find out if somebody goes into his room after he's left. In later films it is no surprise to see invisible cars or x-ray spectacles being used.Connery is charming yet tough - cool and suave but equally adept to being cruel and calculated. Jack Lord plays American CIA operative Felix Leiter with great efficiency - cold yet efficient, in the know but unable to interfere. Ursula Andress is Honey Rider, who even to this day is an iconic for her performance on screen. From the first moment she appears, like she does to Bond, she captures the audience's attention too. Playing ""Dr No"" you have Joseph Wiseman, who had previously been highly regarded on and off stage - he commands presence as the nemesis to Connery's Bond.This film may be dated by today's high budget super explosion films, but this is the film that pathed the way. If not for ""Dr No"" there would be no golden gun, there would be no Blofeld, no riding down mountains in cello cases, no submarine cars, no space flight with metal mouthed henchmen. This is a great film and worthy of a watch. By today's standards it is family safe for the whole family. So, sit back and enjoy the Bond that started it all.In terms of Bond films this is an 8 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would still give this a 7 out of 10.",Dr. No

132,gab-14712,The One That Started It All!,8,22 October 2018,"1963's Dr. No is the first of many James Bond films to come. This particular version is the cheapest one of the series and perhaps one of the more fun ones. The plot is very James Bond-like which means the series generally run on Cold War tropes-but I like the sense of adventure in the movie. We were also introduced to Sean Connery, a relatively unknown actor then. People consider himself one of the greatest James Bond to date, and I completely understand why. What fascinates me about this movie is what it took to bring this movie to the cinema screens.The author of the James Bond books, Ian Fleming wrote his first Bond book in 1952. He believed that his character was more suited to TV or movie screens than on page. Many film producers agreed, but had a hard time bringing the now iconic character to the silver screen. Two producers, Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were key to making this work. Saltzman was able to purchase the rights, but he had no money to produce any movies. Broccoli wanted to buy the rights, but Saltzman refused to sell them. They decided on a partnership. Many studios passed on making these movies, but United Artists were impressed with their dedication to the source material. It was likewise difficult to choose a director, but Terence Young was eventually chosen. Now comes the biggest test. Who will play James Bond? There was David Niven, future Bond Roger Moore, but both actors were unavailable. After a meeting with the producers, they were impressed with Sean Connery.This film introduced many trademarks that would be associated with James Bond films: The legendary James Bond theme composed by Monty Norman and James Barry, that gun barrel sequence, the notion of henchmen and allies, the initial briefings with Bond's handler, M, legendary close calls, Bond girls, and of course everyone's favorite quote, ""The name's Bond....James Bond."" I am very familiar with the newer James Bond movies, so I had a sense of familiarity when viewing the movie and seeing when/where these trademarks were used for the first time.The movie opens up in Jamaica where a British agent was secretly assassinated by a trio of assassins known as the Three Blind Mice. In London, England's best agent James Bond (Sean Connery) is pulled aside by his handler, M (Bernard Lee) where he is told to fly to Jamaica to investigate the murder and also why the Americans believe their rockets are experiencing interference from Jamaica. Bond lands in Jamaica where there are multiple attempts on his life. With assistance from CIA Agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) and seashell collector Honey Rider (Ursula Andress), Bond comes to realize that wicked scientist Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) may be behind the murder and world domination.Who better to play the sophisticated and suave Bond than Sean Connery? From 1963 to 1971, Connery was the ultimate James Bond. It pains me to admit that this is the only Connery performance of Bond I have seen to date. However, what a first impression he left! I truly believe that if anyone other than Connery played Bond in the first movie, the movie would not have worked. He has such charisma and he really knows how to play cool! That said, I need to see the other Bond movies with him in it before I can kick Daniel Craig off the top perch. The other actors in the movies are not entirely well-known, but they were adequate. One of the trademarks of Bond movies I did not mention before are villains with overcooked plots...and that tends to mean over-the-top acting. Joseph Wiseman definitely fits that mold! Ursula Andress is from Sweden and she became well-known overseas thanks to her iconic scene of leaving the water in her bikini. Apparently that scene led the way to the two-piece bathing suit becoming socially acceptable.Dr. No is the one that started it all. This film became a huge hit all over the world, especially in Great Britain. Of course, that success would follow to the United States as 25 films and counting was produced. As for the movie itself, it was cheesy fun. Sometimes the plot/acting would go over-the-top, but that is what an early James Bond film does. Charm, sex, coolness, Sean Connery...the film has it all!My Grade: B",Dr. No

135,sjanders-86430,What a man! What a woman!,10,29 December 2020,"Sean Connery walks and turns like a model here in Dr No, the first Bond film. Connery is so gracefully simple. He is so easily a killer. Each move on Ursela Andress is natural not bold. Dinner with Dr. No shows a smiling charming Connery. I love the tarantula crawling up his sleeping leg under the sheet then emerging up across his arm. Dr. No's hands are mechanical and threatening, but his philosophy of world domination by top criminal minds could have inspired many a sociopath.

Most of the staples of the Connery-era Bond movies are in place for this first installation, but they're all, thankfully, quite moderate; the car chase is realistic, the women don't throw themselves at Bond as disgustingly quickly as we've come to expect, and there are no futuristic gadgets to be seen. Bond is still bursting with testosterone and self confidence, but the general tone is much closer to that of the novels than any Bond movie before George Lazenby came along, and let's face it, Connery is much more charismatic than Lazenby or Dalton ever were. For all those reasons Dr. No remains one of the best Bond movies (even though the good doctor is not nearly as memorable or impressive a villain as Goldfinger or Blofeld) and stands the test of time better than most.",Dr. No

140,mikayakatnt,"Bond, James Bond",7,8 December 2020,"The movie that started one of filmmaking's most famous franchise.Disclaimer: I did not read Ian Fleming's novel of the same name so my review may be biased.Dr. No is an introduction into the Bond universe and the beginning of the spy thriller genre. Dr. No is both influential and innovative in its storytelling and enthralling in its mystery plot. The settings are exotic, the stakes are high, and Sean Connery's performance is captivating. I doubt none other than Sean Connery could have perfected the role that he did as James Bond. His debut into this franchise remains one of the most iconic there is to date.What makes Dr. No a great Bond film is that it's experimental and lays the foundation for future films. The film's a bit rough around the edges but that makes it more authentic and stylish. It's witty and fun while keeping the mystery and suspense.Not to mention the beautiful introduction of Ursula Andress's iconic portrayal of Honey Ryder. An introduction was so powerful that still leaves fans fawning so many years later.The main qualm I have about this movie is the yellowface portrayal of Dr. No by Joseph Wiseman. I found that it completely broke my suspension of belief and made the movie that much harder to watch. Also, his whole plotline didn't make sense to me.

What else can be said about Connery? I think he nailed the strong, smart, sexy, suave, sophisticated, virile, womanizing, character of Bond from the start.

He has began his investigation with the help of a strong boatman and a charismatic CIA agent. However, scientists, double agents and beautiful women are on his way to the main enemy and to solve a mystery...This movie has set certain standards in terms of a character and habits of this main hero. This average fiction is pretty exciting. It balances between actions, mystery, science fiction and sexy situations. The pace is very fast, therefore, obvious flaws are almost not visible, between attempted murders, car chases, poisonous insects or even more toxic beauty in this film.Opening credits is very impressive. An exotic scenery is in contrast with topics in this film.Sean Connery as James Bond, A British MI6 agent, codename 007 is a tall, charismatic and handy man.

143,barryrd,Dr. No standard for the Bond movies,8,7 April 2012,"This first James Bond introduced all the elements we came to associate with the Bond movies and set the groundwork for all the successful sequels. Beginning with the three beggars masquerade to the escape from an island inferno at the end, we see a movie that is so classy and well-written that it just sets the bar at a significant height. The story shows the spy-tech gadgetry, the chase scenes, the well-tailored playboy, the relationship with M (Bernard Lee) and the secretary (Lois Maxwell)and the beautiful leading lady (Ursula Andress). All of this is set up against a background of mistrust and deception in some beautiful locales where the leading man routinely performs feats of heroism and encounters insanely good luck. I wouldn't say it's the best of Bond but it's damn good and sets a standard for the sequels as well as introducing the recurring themes and characters. I like Bernard Lee in a role that is quite a jump ahead from the rather bland characters he played before Bond came along. Bond has to toe the line with this man who can't quite make the grade; we see this in the inferior champagne he serves, which Bond doesn't hesitate to point out. Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny is the attractive secretary making not so subtle hints for a dinner date. She replays this role many times. And of course there is the villain, in this case Dr. No and the female interest, Ursula Andress. The fancy cars, guns, beautiful women, and lifestyle of the rich and famous were some of the elements that made the Bond character one of the more controversial of the counterculture in the 1960's. Yet even his sharpest critics couldn't help finding entertainment value in the Bond genre, the movies they loved to hate. Alas, all memories now!

An obvious trend setter for the later Bond films, Dr. No is a lot of fun to watch with Connery in his iconic role as Bond. The other actors do a great job too, but Connery is the obvious man to steal the show. Wiseman also does a great job as Dr. No. You can see here that No was the archetype of later Bond villains. The action scenes are good but today's movie goers might find them a little tame. It's all about the thrill of watching Bond act with such coolness in dangerous situations. If you're looking for a movie where there's an explosion every minute, you'll have to excuse this one. But if you're looking for a Bond film to watch, this is the perfect place to start.",Dr. No
145,Prichards12345,First of a very up and down film series.,7,2 April 2017,"Having just 1-starred that terrible latest Bond movie SPECTRE (0/2 approval - thanks fanboys), I thought I'd do some more reviews of the Bond series. Doctor No, if I remember rightly, is the sixth Bond novel - I have read them all but it was some time ago. It's easy to see why the producers chose this one first: exotic locations, interesting mystery story, good characters. This is a nice intro for peeps unfamiliar with Bond.This is a film full of iconic moments. ""Bond...James Bond"" to name but one. Connery's magnetic animal charm in this role made him into one of the biggest superstars in post WWII movies. And the guy can act, too. Daniel Craig is great in his first three outings, Moore a laugh, Dalton decent, Lazenby er.... Brosnan wooden; but none of them matched ol' Sean for me. His Bond is pretty different from the character in the books, but god is he good! In this one of course Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the toppling of American missiles ( a bit like North Korea's today!).For a film not far off its sixtieth year, it holds up remarkably well. That moment when Bond offs Anthony Dawson's character Strangways is still startlingly ruthless even today. A really enjoyable ride, then, with it's legendary theme music still one of the most recognisable in cinema. Only the villain disappoints. Fleming apparently recommended his cousin, Christopher Lee for the role. At least he got his chance later!",Dr. No
146,Mightyzebra,My first and THE first of the legacy of JAMES BOND.,8,12 April 2009,"As this was my first ""James Bond"", I did not have a completely formed opinion of what it would be like. By the end I found myself loving it and wanting more. I LOVE Sean Connery (who I am still watching as James Bond in my plough through every single one of them), I enjoyed the fighting scenes (which is VERY unusual for me), I liked the action, I enjoyed the undercover acts of James Bond, I liked the main woman (played by Ursula Andress, who does not actually appear until over halfway into the film, like most of his other girlfriends), I liked the plot and storyline (I have not read the book, but I presume it is similar in plot-line to the original story) and I love the characters and the acting (in general). (Wow, looks like I summed up pretty much all I liked about this film in one sentence with lots of brackets!) It has an atmosphere different to the rest of the Bonds I have watched (so far I've watched the first four) and partly because of it it is my favourite Bond film yet. There was little I did not like about this film, I suppose it is annoying that the main woman did not appear until near the end and there are some annoying bits involving the villains throughout, but nothing huge.I recommend this to people who want an introduction to Sean Connery as James Bond and I recommend this to people who enjoy action films.

148,tomimt,Enjoyable starting point to a long line of movies,7,7 January 2014,"Way back in the time great characters didn't need an introduction movie or a ""begin"" movie. See, in Dr. No, James Bond already is who he is: though, suave, wise cracking, ladies man, gambler and above all a secret agent extraordinaire.If Dr. No would be done today we would meet a very different agent than what Sean Connery so nicely portrays in this first movie of a long lasting series. Instead of seasoned agent we'd probably see something like what Daniel Craig so finely did in Casino Royale, but portrayed by Connery. But that's not here nor there, as what we have in Dr. No is a spy thriller where a top agent James Bond has to save the world, kill the bad guy and get the girl.The big question in Dr. No is has it really stood against the test of time? It is an old movie after all and surprisingly enough, it has, at least mostly. Of course there are scenes in it that are rather poor from todays point of view and many parts in it work mostly because age does bring a certain amount of charm to special effects, but as far action goes, Dr. No manages to hold its own. Granted, the action isn't as spectacular new movies can gear up, but what the movie looses in spectacle it wins back with the easy flow, great locations, decent script and good actors.In the end Dr. No is an enjoyable spy thriller and a movie you can enjoy even if you aren't a Bond fan. It's not the greatest movie in the series, but it also is far from the worst ones.",Dr. No
149,silverscreen888,Strong Point-of-View Thrillers; Technically Attractive; a Taut Bond Debut,7,24 June 2005,"This film was eagerly awaited by fans of Ian Fleming's very-well-received James Bond novels when its production was first announced. Fortunately for the future of this long-lived series, the first film was a very-well made product, bright, fast-paced and relatively faithful to Fleming's exciting original storyline. The credit for its direction goes to Terence Young who also worked on the screenplay. The other writers, Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather deserve credit for outlining a very taut thriller as well. Producers Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli and Harry Saltzman have produced many more films since. Monty Norman and John Barry are credited with the music; Maurice Binder delivered the first of many much-admired main titles. Ted Moore's luminous cinematography proved a great asset, as did Tess Wellborn's lively costumes and many other creator's and technicians' elements. The key to the filming of this Jamaica-based story, however, was making the MI6 Agency and its 007 (licensed to kill) operative James Bond believable to viewers. So when fans of the novels saw Bernard Lee as ""M"", the Agency's operations director, lovely Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and a bevy of attractive ladies who could actually act a little--set like jewels about the central gem of the piece that is Sean Connery as Bond--they were all-but-unanimously enthralled. The murder of MI6 Station Agent Commander Strangways and his titian-haired secretary by three fake blind men begins an espionage thriller as the opening moves in a mental chess match that eventually pits the resourceful Bond against ""Doctor No"", agent of SMERSH and ruthless cat-loving maniac. The first introduction of Bond in a gambling casino here is masterful; his laconic one-liner speech style and independence of mind refreshing at all points. Sent to Jamaica, he makes contact with his American counterpart, the first of a series of ""Felix Leiters"", Jack Lord, and Quarrel, the local boat captain who had been escorting Strangways on his investigations of mysterious goings-on at Crab Key--which we learn is Julius No's HQ. Others in the cast besides Connery, who is the quintessential Bond to most aficionados of the series, include Anthony Dawson as a nervous villain, John Kitzmiller as a creditable Quarrel, and Peter Burton. As shell seeker Honey Ryder, Ursula Andress looks pretty and gets by as a very young prop in the story. Battles with a mechanical monster, a tarantula, deadly ladies, bad men and more menaces follow until Bond is captured and meets his arch enemy in his own lair, a man using his capacity to divert US missiles from their intended flight paths. How Bond succeeds in his mission of stopping Dr. No--in the estimable person of actor Joseph Wiseman-- and his sinister organization makes for an exciting action climax to the film.Kudos are due to all concerned for taking a well-plotted novel and turning it into a glowing example of how to make a film from the ethical point-of-view of a worthy central character. This is a watchable film that bears repeated screenings well.",Dr. No
150,timdalton007,Meet Bond...James Bond,7,31 January 2011,"A series of white dots move across a black screen, freezing only to present the words ""Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman present"". Suddenly the dots turn into the insides of a gun-barrel with a well dressed man wearing a hat walking along, the gun-barrel following his steps. Suddenly the man turns and fires a gun towards the audience, blood flowing down the inside of the gun-barrel just as a soon to be iconic piece of music begins to play. This of course is the iconic opening of the first James Bond movie Dr. No nearly fifty years ago. With Dr. No, a movie that cost a little more then a million dollars to make and featured a cast of relative nobodies, a movie franchise was launched. Looking back nearly fifty years, and twenty-two movies later, how well does this opening hold up?Perhaps the thing that holds up the most is Sean Connery's debut as James Bond. From the moment he says his first line leading into perhaps the most famous introduction in movie history, the then unknown actor becomes James Bond. Connery's Bond is a Bond who can be believable in a tuxedo at the beginning of the movie, fine suits throughout much of the rest of the movie yet beaten and roughed up towards the end. This is a Bond who is seductive and charming towards any woman he meets yet cold-blooded with a sharp wit. As a result, this is a hero who is utterly believable yet somehow fantastic at the same time and Connery gives the part that quality.This is all the more important since Connery is without two Bond movie elements: the Bond girl and the villain. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder finally appears 62 minutes into a 109 minute movie while Joseph Wiseman as the title villain, Dr. No doesn't make an on screen appearance until there's only 25 minutes left (in a shot of his hands and legs!). While neither role is particularly large, both Andress and Wiseman make the most of their appearances. These range from Honey's now iconic introduction to Wiseman's sparking dialogue with Connery's Bond. Both of them set the standard for all those who follow both for the 1960s and beyond.The supporting cast does a fine job as well. Making their debuts in the franchise are two later stalwarts of the series: Bernard Lee as M and Lois Maxwell as the ever faithful Miss Moneypenny who both firmly establish their character's in the space of a few minutes. Helping out Bond on this first adventure is future Hawaii Five-O star Jack Lord as CIA agent Felix Leiter and John Kitzmuller as Quarrel, a role that seems both a bit racist and dated fifty years on but one that Kitzmuller does a pretty good job with nonetheless. Rounding out the supporting cast are Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent, Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench, Peter Burton as Major Boothroyd (aka Q, the role that Desmond Llewelyn made famous), Louis Blaazer as British diplomat Pleydell-Smith and Zena Marshall as the mysterious Miss Taro. All around Dr. No is blessed with a fine supporting cast.Given that Dr. No effectively had a low budget, it looks splendid for its time. Ken Adams production design gives the movie a larger then life quality that perfectly suits the movie, even if it does get the design of a nuclear reactor just slightly wrong. The production design is aided immensely by the cinematography of Ted Moore which not only shows off Adams sets (such as the single shot that shows off Doctor No's dining room) but also gives the movie a strong sense of menace throughout. The editing of Peter Hunt keeps the movie moving in what could otherwise be dull moments. Even the limited amount of action sequences are well staged and stand up fairly well even now. There are also some good special effects in the form of model shots, those some of the back projection shots are just a bit too obvious. The score from Monty Norman also seems to be a bit lacking, especially with its repetitive use of the James Bond theme, though it has some effective moments such as the tarantula scene or the final confrontation between Bond and Doctor No. All of these elements, under the supervision of Terrance Young make for a film that stands out production value wise.Which brings us to the script. Adapted from Ian Fleming's sixth James Bond novel, the script is for the most part faithful to the original novel though it does lose perhaps the most cinematic sequence of the novel. The plot and the villain's plot are perhaps simplistic compared to some of the world threatening ones of later movies of the series: agent 007 is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a British agent who was investigating the potential sabotaging of American rocket launches (keep in mind this was 1962 and the space race was still in full swing). It is the script that also dates the film most heavily. It is the casual racism used towards the Jamaican character's, especially with Quarrel and Bond's interactions with him, that do that the most. Those moments, like Quarrel's belief in a dragon on Doctor No's island or taking Bond's command to ""fetch my shoes"", are cringe worthy today and help to show how far not just Bond but perhaps the world has come in nearly fifty years.Despite some flaws, Doctor No holds up well. From Sean Connery's perfect debut as Bond to the effective performances of the rest of the cast and good production values that hold up well decades later. While the script and plot may seem dated today, for their time they were good though it's hard to excuse the racism throughout the movie. All told though, James Bond was off to a good start and the best was yet to come...",Dr. No

152,Bogmeister,BOND#1: With His Walther PPK in Hand,8,13 May 2007,"MASTER PLAN: sabotage America's space program. Way back when, the wicked humor was already evident, indoctrinating us into a new style of mayhem and violence. Three blind mice, it sings over the credits, after the now-familiar gun-barrel opening shot. These are three blind men, or so it seems, tragically comical as they make their way along; but, we're in for a rude awakening - they are actually ruthless assassins. We're rarely prepared for such plot turns in a Bond thriller, even now, and back then, this being the first one, it must have been fairly shocking. Especially brutal is the murder of the female - this was no way to treat a lady back then. Of course, other ladies in this pic behaved somewhat differently than viewers were accustomed to back in the early sixties. Then Bond himself, 007, is introduced or, actually, introduces himself (on his home ground of England) - a classic for the ages, as if the filmmakers knew he would still be thrilling us on film four decades later. Maybe they did. Then the 1st appearances of M (male for the next 30 years or so) and Moneypenny, and we're off and running, for 45 years and counting. Even the Q dept. shows up in M's office, but he's not called Q, yet (M refers to him as 'Armourer'); and, a different actor would take over in the next 15 or so Bonders. The repartee here would be revisited in most of the subsequent films and is very enjoyable. Later, we and Bond meet Leiter, Bond's CIA liaison, even though this was redone in the new ""Casino Royale"" version in 2006.Bond's first mission on film (not counting the TV ""Casino Royale"" back in '54) was to Jamaica, where a local agent and his secretary have disappeared. As such, this first one had less scope than the epic adventures dominating the later sixties and onward, where the formula always entailed about three different locations scattered across the globe; Bond stayed in the Jamaica area for this entire mission. And, for most of the film, he was engaged in almost pure detective work, a skill which many feel was subsumed under gadgetry and huge sets as the film series went on. I suppose this can be viewed as a trade off when the budgets became much bigger. But here, Connery as Bond had to command our attention through his powers of observation, training and natural cunning. Bond is a target as soon as he arrives at the new locale and must avoid such dangers as assassination attempts by being pro-active: he anticipates the bad guys, obviously due to years of experience. Connery proves to be the best Bond right off the bat: you can see him out-thinking the villains scene to scene and he's arrogant enough to allow himself some self-knowing smirking as he foils their lethal plans over & over, yet it's not over the top; in fact, it can be quite chilling - Bond proves to be just as ruthless as the villains, a type of hero audiences were not, again, used to (Dirty Harry copied this attitude in the States almost a decade later). But, we cheer him on, knowing that if he was any nicer, he'd probably be terminated halfway thru the story. And, the arrogance - some of this just makes us shake our heads: near the end, when Bond is captured, he's still issuing orders to his captors (check out that scene just before the decontamination). No wonder Bond wins at everything.The epic, fantastic elements the film series is known for do not enter the picture here until the 2nd hour begins, involving such concepts as radioactivity and guidance rocket systems. Bond finally meets his main Bond girl, Ms. Ryder, coming out of the blue or out of the sea, take your pick. She is stunning, no doubt, and lends to this air of the unexpected, with some unusual character traits. The main villain of the title and his awesome lair are not shown until even later - such large elements were given more exposure in many of the later films. This is all calculated to string the audience along in terms of suspense (we do hear Dr.No's ominous voice in an earlier scene) and then, hopefully, fulfill their expectations with some grand reveals. Dr.No is the first of the wealthy, genius-level megalomaniacs to plague Bond in the film series, suitably larger-than-life and almost godlike (but serving dark gods). He's created his own world and seems serene in his near-omnipotence, which also may suggest over confidence. This may be why Bond's escape (via an air duct) to cause trouble in the final minutes appears to be a gross oversight for such a master villain. Well, Dr.No spells it out ('You are just a stupid policeman'): master villains tended to underestimate Bond in many of the films. Bond may also pique such villains curiosity - it may be reasonable to assume his ruthlessness is a trait they need to examine for a brief, crucial time. By the way, SPECTRE is first mentioned, being the organization Dr.No serves, so it does suggest a series of films from the get go. Bond would return in ""From Russia With Love."" Would Dr.No?

It thought the movie still had at least another 30minutes to go, but no... the movie just ended.Also, tire-screeching sounds, but they're driving on a dirt road? Man, but movies were bad in the 1960s! Like hilariously bad. And then a guy getting set on fire whilst he's about 5 meters away from the sea... he just lies down and dies, instead of running into the water... that's just awful.Simply can't recommend this one; rather watch Thunderball (1965), as it's somewhat better",Dr. No

In which only who perfectly plays - young Sean Connery. Plot absolutely boring and trivial. The movie obviously not applies for a lot of things, and everything would be normal if not awful work of make-up artists. So it was necessary to spoil Sean Connery to try. Why was to him to paint lips? It I not to understanding.",Dr. No
156,LebowskiT1000,Make way for James Bond!!!,9,10 December 2002,"It is very hard to view this film objectively for many reasons, but mainly for two reasons.  First, this film is 16 years older than I am, and thus VERY dated to me.  And secondly, I've seen many of the other (and later) Bond films long before finally seeing this film.  Despite these obstacles in the way of my objective viewing and reviewing, I've tried my hardest.All in all, I thought the film was great.  No, it wasn't as exciting as a great deal of films today, but it's still a good film.  The story is quite good and still holds up today.  The story can be quite slow at times, but nonetheless an enjoyable film.I thought it was somewhat odd that James Bond didn't have any type of nifty gadgets like he does in later films, other than the gun that is.  At the same time, not having all those amazing gadgets gave the film a little more realism and didn't give Bond such an advantage.The cast was quite good in the film.  Sean Connery was great, as can be expected.  He did play a very good James Bond.  The antagonist in the film, Dr. No, played by Joseph Wiseman was acted very well.  I did enjoy his evil-ness very much and thought he played the part perfectly.  Ursula Andress...what can I say?  WOW!!!  She is most definitely reason enough to see this film!  She looks absolutely flawless in the film and is a fine actress as well.  I really liked the character of Felix Leiter, played by Jack Lord.  I really liked the chemistry and interactions between him and James Bond.  Bernard Lee did a fine job as M as well.  The rest of the cast was great too.  Also, I feel I should mention Terence Young, the director. Terence did a great job and got the ball rolling for a great deal of future Bond movies.If you are a fan of any of the James Bond films, then I would recommend seeing this film solely on the basis that this is where it all began.  Just be aware that this is a rather old film and isn't the same James Bond that we see in 2002.  In any case, I hope you enjoy the film, and thanks for reading,-Chris",Dr. No
157,nicholls_les,Where it all began,10,23 November 2015,"Had to give this 10 because not only is this where the James Bond series of films began, it is in many ways one of the best Bond films ever made.Considering when it was made and the relatively small budget it is a really good film and has sure stood the test of time.007, Britain's top agent and is on a mission to solve the mysterious murder of a fellow agent in Jamaica. (good to see Jamaica as it was in the 60s) He joins forces with Quarrel and a loyal CIA agent, Felix Leiter and the beautiful Honey Ryder played by Ursula Andress.There are two iconic scenes in this film that are still regarded as milestones in film making history.Honey Ryder's coming out of the Caribbean sea and Sean Connery's delivering the iconic line .... Bond, James Bond.Wonderful!I think it is a shame that the recent Daniel Craig Bond movies have moved so far away from the Bond of the books, Craig's Bond is more Rambo/Bourne than Bond. Craig does not have the suave sophistication that Connery had and recent movies are just action over substance.",Dr. No
158,brett-76260,Dr Yes!,8,9 November 2018,If you haven't seen this yet don't k ow what you're waiting for. It's not the best Bond movie and certainly not the worst... just a great overall movie...,Dr. No
159,Rickting,Bond begins in style,7,5 July 2014,"Dr No begins the Bond formula in suitable style. James Bond movies are full of high tech escapism and represent a brilliant fantasy, one which no other franchise has ever captured so successfully. James Bond, the womanizing, cold blooded and risk taking spy that he is, works as a symbol of pure escapism, but for me he works due to the flaws and enigmatic vulnerability of the character. His first outing hasn't aged well but still serves up plenty of escapism and cinematic sparkle. Heading to Jamaica to investigate the death of another agent, Bond tries to find who's responsible and encounters exotic locations, danger, suspense, the first Bond Super-Villain and the first major Bond Girl, Honey Ryder, who makes the greatest entrance of the franchise (Bond's entrance in this is a close second) and is still defining the Bond Girl more than 50 years later. This is a sedate but tense outing with a sense of danger but also restraint lacking in many other entries. It's a well directed film and the direction adds realism and suspense to an unrealistic storyline.Sean Connery Is James Bond. He simply is Bond and plays him excellently. He gets even better in the next 2 movies. A well written movie overall, Dr No's status as the first Bond film has led to it being given more praise than it deserves. It's slow, at times pretty boring and has feels rather dated. The action scenes are too short and the representation of women, a huge issue throughout the franchise, isn't any better here. What people forget is that Honey Ryder doesn't affect the plot at all. It lacks the chemistry that defines later instalments and lacks many memorable moments although Dr No himself is a good villain. Definitely an overpraised entry and the level of enjoyment varies between viewings but it's always perfectly enjoyable and is a good film in general. It's not the Bond film you'll go to for a great time and a big adrenaline rush, but it's a good film in general and in the 60s it must have been absolutely incredible. Now, it's still good although overshadowed by the next 2 Bond films.7/10",Dr. No
160,grendelkhan,The fun begins,7,17 September 2005,"The first James Bond film sets the tone for those to follow, while remaining fairly faithful to the source material. Here, we are introduced to the (relatively) unknown Sean Connery, in probably the most memorable screen introduction a character ever had.Director Terence Young set the style for all of the Bonds. He brought the charm and sophistication to the character, while adding doses of humor at the end of action sequences. He assembled a first-rate stunt team to create memorable action sequences. He keeps the material moving at a brisk pace, while taking time to add the lush scenery of the locations.Sean Connery is James Bond. He doesn't resemble Fleming's descriptions, but he inhabits the character. He is suave and charming, but has a deadly aura about him. With Connery, you know that he can walk into a bar and take on, and beat, 90% of the inhabitants. Roger Moore is a sissy in comparison.The first film steers fairly close to Fleming's story, while adding SPECTRE to the mix. This elevates it above the detective-style thriller of Fleming's novel, giving it a more epic scope; but it still tends toward pulp fiction (the genre, not the movie).Dr No is essentially Fu Manchu, and Bond is Nayland Smith. They are more modern characters, but it's still the rather racist ""yellow peril"". Making it still worse is a Caucasian actor playing an Asian villain; but Bond was never noted for political correctness. The novels and films are filled with negative racial stereotypes.The film hinges more on suspense than most of the later entries, with the stuntwork kept on a more realistic scale. The spider sequence is quite gripping (until you see the glass reflected) and is one of the most memorable scenes in any of the films.The casting is fine, for the most part. Jack Lord is hard to take seriously, especially having been introduced to him first in Hawaii 5-0. I kept waiting for him to say ""Book 'em, Danno!"" Lord is wooden and forgettable as Felix Leiter, a character who has never been done justice in the films.Ursula Andress is beautiful, but not much of an actress, thereby setting the standard for most actresses in the Bond films. Only Diana Rigg showed real acting talent.Joseph Wiseman is suitably menacing as Dr No, but the make-up is not very convincing. It would have been better to cast an Asian actor, but Hollywood is noted for its forward thinking.All in all, this is an enjoyable entry that previewed the greatness that was to follow. It is a taught thriller, more realistic than later films. My only quibble is the music. The Jamaican songs are fine, but the score doesn't measure up to later entries, although we are introduced to the awesome James Bond Theme, a favorite of guitarists everywhere.",Dr. No
161,beresfordjd,Nostagia ain't what it used to be!!,6,9 October 2010,I read the books as a teenager and loved them. I went to see all the movies as they came out becoming more and more disillusioned as Bond became jokey and camped up when Roger Moore took over the role. I was appalled at the wooden acting of Timothy Dalton. Then Brosnan came in and things improved and finally Craig made Bond what he was supposed to be again. Now I find myself watching Dr No again on a dull Saturday afternoon on TV. I remember being excited and thrilled by it on its initial release when the (almost) unknown Sean Connery WAS Bond. He was so right for the part. But seeing the film now I am disappointed by the poor acting of the minor characters and the dodgy authenticity of the Jamaica sequences-accents and scenes. The only reason it still works (kinda) is Connery -of course then we were not aware that he only ever plays Connery and it is part of the reason he is a star. Of course the film is so much slower than action movies are these days but at the time it seemed to be pacy and exciting. Modern viewers may not enjoy it because of the lack of pace and incident and who could blame them when they have seen Die Hard et al.,Dr. No
162,andrewroy-04316,"A palatable, shallow action movie",6,2 July 2020,"As someone who's never familiarized myself with the Bond movies, this one feels like exactly what I'd expect. It's completely fine, but especially retrospectively feels extremely cliched and uninvigorating. The plot is simple but well developed, and Connery plays the smooth Bond well. I do like the way this film introduces Bond as a smooth, unbeatable agent. I would've liked there to have been an actual character behind it, but at least he's a fun action star, though that's all he is here. The other characters don't offer us anything better, especially Honey, who is a really bland damsel in distress. The action scenes don't age super well, especially the punching and car chase, but this was nearly 60 years ago. The plot does move along swiftly enough that it's never quite boring, but also lacks real tension and intrigue. Dr. No doesn't have any ideas on its mind and doesn't leave you thinking about it, but as an early influential mindless action movie, it does alright for itself.",Dr. No

Dr. No is well worth a watch if you like good movies. 7,5/10",Dr. No
164,TheMan3051,Bond. James Bond,9,26 October 2001,"As uttered 39 years ago by Scottish born actor Sean Connery it would become one of the most famous quotes in cinema history and introduced one of the most sought out characters in cinema history. The story of James Bond goes back many years ago, actually during the 1950s (I think) but in reality it goes back even more than that. As for Ian Fleming a former British naval intelligence officer his inspiration for the character came about during those days when he was fascinated by one Secret Service Agent who was known for his crazy womanizing and drinking. That would be the first inspiration for the character which left a lasting impression on Fleming who decided to write a novel about a British Secret Service agent named James Bond who is a womanizing, martini drinking agent with very exciting and out of this world adventures. Fleming after he retired from the British Secret Service moved to Jamaica to begin his work as a writer. Fleming wrote 12 novels and 2 collections of short stories between 1952 and 1964 detailing the exploits of his fictional hero. Which one of the novels ""Casino Royal"" became a TV movie of the week during the 1950s but that did nothing to help the character leap into the screen or to the American public but that would all change in 1962.
It was in October of 1962 that the first theatrical James Bond movie ""Dr. No"" premiered. Produced via United Artist by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman on a budget of roughly $1 million, the movie starred Sean Connery as Bond, the lovely Ursula Andress as Honey Rider, Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No and not to mention Jack Lord as the original and best Felix. Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell appeared as respectively, British intelligence head M and secretary, Miss Moneypenny (roles the two actors would reprise throughout the series). Despite the fact that this is the most low-key of the series it is still a very great start for the series and not to mention it`s perhaps one of the best in the series. This film is quite different from the rest mainly because it`s a mystery thriller. The script was co-written by Richard Maibaum, who would also become part of the bond ""team"" returning in the future to author or co-author all but three of the first 16 productions. Directed beautifully by Terence Young the film is about Bonds investigation into the murder of a Jamaica-based British agent, which ultimately leads to an insidious plot to disrupt U.S. Space launches. As for the music it was a Friday night phone call from Noel Rodgers, head of music at United Artist, that put John Barry to work on the orchestration of Monty Norman`s two minute composition that would become the famous James Bond theme. The film is a great start for a great and exciting series.",Dr. No
165,nickenchuggets,The name's Bond. James Bond.,9,25 June 2021,"Being the first in an ever-growing line of movies now known as James Bond films, Dr. No is certainly a good enough starting point for the series. As of now, I haven't seen any other Bond movies, so hopefully writing about this one will encourage me to. Surprisingly, this movie was made using a limited budget of a little over a million dollars, but accumulated sixty times that at the box office. The reason for this success becomes clear when you take a look at the movie's plot. It is about a guy named John who works for MI6 (a real life British spy organization) being killed in Jamaica by some hitmen, who later burgle his house. MI6 sends agent James Bond (Sean Connery) to find out what exactly happened to him. Bond deduces John was killed because he was involved with the CIA, who at this time are investigating jamming signals being directed at rockets launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida. After trying to locate the jamming signal's location, Bond goes to an island called Crab Key, where someone tries to kill him with a tarantula. Bond and a few of his companions delve deeper into the island while being pursued by guards who are determined to keep what goes on there a secret. An armored vehicle armed with a flamethrower immolates one of Bond's friends, after which Bond and Honey Ryder (a girl he met previously on the island) are taken prisoner. After being fed drinks laced with drugs, they wake up to the presence of Dr. No, who is the owner of the secret base, and also has metal hands. He says he wants to use a radio beam to interrupt a rocket ship taking off from Florida, and when Bond refuses to assist him, he is locked away. As expected, he manages to escape and overload the nuclear reactor that powers the radio beam as it charges up. When No tries to kill Bond, he falls into the reactor and dies. Bond then frantically runs around the base, trying to find Ryder before the whole compound explodes, after which they both escape on a boat. Dr. No is a good enough start to an impressive franchise, and James Bond as a character is probably the most well known spy in history, fictional or not. There's an abundance of nice action scenes in this movie, and they help move the story forward. It's not like they just put gaudy things in for the spectacle of it. Bond himself is obviously played to great effect by the immortal Sean Connery, and he is what comes to mind when most people think of these movies. Interestingly, Connery wasn't their first choice to play the character. Patrick Mcgoohan around this time was insanely popular, especially in television thanks to his role as John Drake, the spy that works for NATO in the stellar espionage series Danger Man. Mcgoohan turned down the role after saying how James Bond has no appeal if you take away his weapons. In spite of this, Connery would go on to achieve legendary fame as the character, due to his ability to find his way out of basically any impossible situation. Ursula Andress plays Honey Ryder, who meets Bond later in the movie when he goes to the island in search of No's base. Apparently they had to get another voice actress to re-dub her lines because she sounded too german. Finally, Joseph Wiseman plays Dr. No, the movie's main villain and direct antithesis to Bond. He's threatening, smart, and dangerous, if a little impulsive. Christopher Lee was originally considered for the part, but Wiseman had already been picked by that point. To make a long story short, Dr. No is a solid first installment in what would become the most celebrated spy movie series in history.",Dr. No
166,FilmFanInTheHouse,A Great Start to the Bond Saga,7,14 November 2006,"Who would have thought that when Dr No opened, that it would lead to the 20 + picture saga it has accomplished. The casting of Sean Connery as James Bond 007 was perfect. He could be violent and lethal one second, and be charming and oozing with sex appeal the next. The rest of the cast performed brilliantly. MI6 really did feel like the actual MI6. All the actors portrayed their characters brilliantly, and brought them to life. There wasn't a huge amount of action, but the story made up to it.The build up to the villain was well done, with him only having his face appear in two scenes. The other villains were very well chosen, with not one of them really screaming villain out to you. The legendary 007 theme brought the experience to life, but i felt that it was played too many times. All he would have to do is walk into a room, and his theme will play.Dr No begins a wonderful trip through the 007 saga. There will be some bad films (Moonraker, Die Another Day), some good ones (Goldfinger, For Your Eyes Only) and other memorable appearances (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Goldeneye), Dr No is surely a wonderful hit to start with.",Dr. No
167,dfle3,A very dry James Bond... before the clichés kicked in...,6,18 June 2010,"In this debut of the super spy franchise, Bond comes across as a civil servant type...white collar, charming at times, but gruff at others...not exactly suave.The setting:The Caribbean...Kingston, Jamaica.The plot:Bond has to go to the Caribbean in order to find out what happened to a fellow spy - I think - in Kingston, Jamaica. Related to this disappearance, N.A.S.A. rockets have received interference from the island and landed off course.Adding to this mystery is a character know as ""Dr.No"". He owns a nearby island which is very strict in ensuring that unwanted visitors are kept out...or disappear if they do venture on to his land. You just know that Bond will have his interest piqued by this state of affairs!Having started at the start of this series, I can now see how there is evolving storyline which requires seeing things from the beginning in order to make sense of references in later movies. E.g. one later Bond pre-opening titles sequence featured a character I knew nothing about...but I would have been clued into him by watching the earliest Bond movies.Bond movie conventions:* Pre-opening title sequence: No, but you do get the sequence where Bond shoots in your general direction, with a tunnel graphic (oh...recently found out that this is meant to be a gun barrel...not that that makes the graphic any more logical!). However, now when I tend to think of these sequences with Connery I remember him as having an awkward gait with a wonky back leg when he fires his gun! You think a small gust of wind could knock him over! Not sure if this trait was there right from this first movie or not.* Movie theme with guest artist: ...no...you only hear the original Monty Norman score...for the first time, of course. You do get some other musical vignettes, but that's only to place the movie geographically...Calypso music in other words...with ""Three blind mice"" done in the latter style too.* Bond banging on about wines: ...um...not really...he does do it, but only once, and not in the insufferable way that he does in later movies! You do have room service mentioning that his drink was ""mixed not stirred""...a proto-cliché here, I think...or maybe he just becomes more insufferable in later movies! Bond mentions Dom Perignon '53...Dr. No asks Bond if he thinks him a fool...not sure if he is referring to this drink suggestion or not.Silly female character names:Ooh yeah. Not as grotesque as in later movies though. This one has a poignant back story...which isn't always the case.* Sexism: ...not really. However, Bond does let another male rough up a female...he'd do that in later movies himself. Maybe this just indicates that on this level Bond is for equal opportunity...a woman is not exempt from any violence a recalcitrant male could expect from Bond.* Q and his spy gadgets: No.* M:Yes. Bernard Lee starts a long run of movies in this role.* Teaser for sequel at closing credits: No.Things to watch out for:* Having recently seen a featurette with ""The spy who loved me"" which outlined production designer Ken Hand's contribution to the franchise, I have to say that the set where Dr.No is first introduced is visually stunning.* Adding this comment in, so my memory is a bit foggy, but when Bond is in Dr.No's lair, he has some awkward looking bumps with his female co-star...she bangs her head on him, and he nearly trips over...unintentionally, or course, but it works for the scene! An era of one take sufficing! You see similar stuff in the next movie, ""From Russia with love"" (see my review of that for details).A commercial network in Australia is showing all the Bond movies in chronological order now, so I thought I'd check out all those movies I never saw. My first Bond movie was ""For your eyes only"" which exhilarated me. Anyway, wanted to review this movie a few weeks back and I thought I could remember the details...when that sounded too hard, I watched a repeat on the network's second, digital channel. Initial impressions not much changed...movie scores between 60 and 70 out of 100.Having seen later Bond movies, I thought that maybe the orbit around America and Americans was a new thing...to attract American audiences. However, it is in the movies right from the start...Bond, as an agent for MI7 deals with a C.I.A. operative known as Felix Leiter.As for Sean Connery's James Bond...at the start he has a rather curt persona at times...as if speaking to hired hands. He can be abrasive in this way, and he barks out orders at time. The suavity would come later. Not sure if Bond is meant to be English, but he does sound quite Scottish at times. Not really relevant, but when Bond meets some men in a Jamaican club, I was struck how much Mel Gibson was brought to mind...a similar look and demeanor at times. This resemblance lasted only for this scene.Not a bad movie, just not great. Watching it for a second time in about a month or so wasn't particularly torturous though, which speaks well for it. There is a scene in this movie which is described as ""iconic"", I think...where she of the silly name first emerges. Personally I didn't find it all that memorable...but I was watching on the small screen. From memory, the latest James Bond, Daniel Craig, was more fawned over by the camera in a recreation of that scene in...was it ""Casino Royale""? If this movie had done that, it might have been more memorable for me.",Dr. No
168,Al_The_Strange,Say Yes To Dr. No,8,2 March 2015,"Not counting the 1954 made-for-TV rendition of Casino Royale, the film adaptation of Dr. No is where the cinematic saga of James Bond truly begins. Chances are that you already know the man, even if you've never seen the movies; Bond's image and swagger have permeated through pop culture for the past five decades, crafting the classic archetype and stereotype of a British special agent (look no further than Austin Powers, Archer, or Kingsman for many fine examples of how far and how long the Bond image has persevered). He is timelessly appealing through his smooth combination of charm, sophistication, and ruthlessness.Dr. No introduces us to the rough and romantic adventures of Bond. It's nowhere near as action-packed as other movies in the series, but its simplicity as a spy thriller is what makes it elegant. There are just a few fights and chases; when they happen, they are modestly satisfying and thrilling. Most of the film's appeal will be in the smaller details; the way Bond dives into the mystery and sidesteps henchmen at every turn is expert and cool. It gradually builds up to an outlandish climax, in which Bond confronts the titular Dr. No in his secret lair, and has to stop his evil schemes. This becomes the fundamental template for future Bond films, but Dr. No stands out with its fair share of iconic scenes, including Bond's introduction during a game of Baccarat, a certain scene at a beach where Honey Rider makes her appearance, and a memorable dinner scene with the villain.The story follows after Ian Fleming's novel faithfully, although many parts of the story are changed. The story unfolds pretty neatly, gradually introducing the audience to Bond, the various characters he encounters, and the exotic world he inhabits. The plot has a satisfying structure, filled with just enough thrills and mystery to keep it moving. Even though Bond himself is an alluring character, most of the people in the film are one-dimensional; hardly anything is revealed about their motivations to make them stand out above the definitions of their archetypes. However, they all have a worthy presence and are likable to some degree. The film overall plays out as a fine piece of adventure and escapism, but it's only a small taste of even greater things to come.The film sports very good photography and editing. Acting is swell; Sean Connery is perfectly charismatic and iconic as James Bond, embodying all the right aspects to make his character shine even to this day. Joseph Wiseman is pretty stiff and robotic as the villain, but for interesting effect. I felt Ursula Andress was somewhat unlikable in her role; she's best seen for her looks. I enjoyed the performances of Jack Lord and most other players. Writing is not too shabby. This production uses very exotic and interesting locales. Sets, props, and costumes are quite old-fashioned, but still very slick. The music score features a lot of really funky calypso music, but Monty Norman's main theme is an instantly recognizable tune that resonates to this day.Dr. No is one slick thriller. Future Bond films will take the character to even more exciting adventures with even bigger stakes and bolder expressions, but this is the film that started it all, and it deserves a watch at least once.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",Dr. No
169,J_Batek_II,The Iconic Debut Of A Serious James Bond.,7,2 June 2019,"James Bond has went though many actors and many personalities over nearly 60 years that he has been appearing on film. Personally, I look for reality in film, and I prefer Daniel Craig as James Bond. Daniel Craig plays a darker, more serious James Bond, and that's the James Bond I want to see.So, what about 'Dr. No' (1961) and Sean Connery? What type of personality and tone did Sir Connery set the pace with out of the gate? Well, James Bond is a subject where everyone has an opinion and wants to debate. But, here is a little something I noticed in the film...On his way to see Miss Taro, some thugs try to run him off the road. James lives, now knowing that Miss Taro set him up. But, when he arrives (much to her surprise), he plays dumb. After repeated attempts, he finally seduces Miss Taro into bed. Post-coitus, Bond tries to arrange for a car to leave. Miss Taro has been told to keep Bond at her house until more hit men can arrive (hence, the copulation was to stall for more time). So, left with no choice, Miss Taro now seduces Bond - an almost immediate male turn-around, nearly impossible for most men. But, James Bond is not most men, and he complies with her seemingly insatiable need for his 'Third British Leg'. So, now, after two rounds of love-making, Bond turns her over to MI6 and leaves out the front door. Pretty cold, mate. Pretty cold.You know, he didn't have to go in for a second lap... but, he was just that kind of guy, I guess. Dark... Serious... Kind of an *******...

170,markovd111,"First one, but not the best one!",8,22 March 2021,"Dr. No is a good Bond movie and still has a lot of charm, along with legendary Sean Connery which successfully brought the agent 007 to the big screens (even Fleming, after initially disapproving, later said he is satisfied with him) and legendary Monty Norman's music, which became the series staple. However, budget was small compared to later Bond titles, and while the movie still manages to be fun, it doesn't feel perfect. But it didn't have to be and doesn't need to be. It was a start of a movie franchise that would brings us cult movies and it deserves a full respect from us as the viewers. Style of the movie is excellent, women are gorgeous and atmosphere is great, while the treatment of Cold War theme is good! Sure, the action feels dated and the ending feels rushed, but it's all fun for someone who likes older movies. And considering the part where I should say that Bond is a sexist character, I disagree, because nowadays, official videos of pop songs on YT have more sexist treatment of male and female body than any of the Bond movies.

Is it a good start? ,well that in the end is up to you but as for me I felt it was strongly a kind of good film, I know many absolutely love this but some find it lacklustre, just sit back and see, here is why I felt it was a strongly OK film below.The story kicks off with a bang, and a beautiful location to go with it, and with also joining in a sinister looking villain, what else could you really need to see from Bond. Although I don't think this is executed perfectly it still makes for good viewing and can still entertain fans and not particular fans a like. The story is somewhat predictable toward the end but with a middle part that I found especially thrilling it makes up for lost time with a great bunch of scenes where Bond is in trouble.Connery starts safely and firmly brings us a taste to come from his era as Bond, with a suave suit that can dazzle the ladies, to a swimsuit that can well, also dazzle the ladies Connery oozes charm. The rest of the cast take a much further back seat to Sean and Ursula Andress as the Bond girl is good but not perfect and I felt she seemed a little lost in this. Other characters such as Quarrel a local Cayman Islander make fun work too and definitely help this films rating go up a little.Terence Young kicks Bond off under his guise and makes a good if not sometimes odd selection job, but overall he does well, The reason it is odd is simple things like physics, the stunts could have been done a certain way but they insist on being ridiculous, and I think Young did this. Written well though and introducing things that are still seen today in Bond the writing creates a sense that Bond was always there, and we always knew it. I loved the location to it, it doesn't really help the films mark but it looks stunning and sets off the adventures Bond goes on.The film isn't a super solid piece and with slower parts and bits that seem pointless, Dr No is a film I feel is overrated but nevertheless a kind of good one. It can sometimes lack the thrills we expect and I am not sure if that is down to it being a light 60's film, or the writing or directing just screwing it up, anyway it is the film still manages a lot of positive away from such things as thrills and drama that may lack here.Bond fans well, I am not saying you should watch it as it is the best, but you have to see it to call yourself a true fan with most of the things Bond does originating from this film. Those wanting a more dark Bond will still be disappointed and a dark Bond doesn't really come round the corner until way off in 1989, so stay off if you dislike charm and style, and want big bucks guns and effects.Overall I give this a 6/10 meaning It is Strongly an OK film, near to be being good but just misses out with the criticisms I gave it. It is still a fun film and worth a watch as the story is basic like but serves to let you enjoy it, but don't feel you have to like it because others say so much good stuff about it. On that point to any critics, never feel pressured to rate this lower even if everyone seems to love it, the film is far from flawless.",Dr. No
172,majikstl,"""So beware...Three blind mice...""",6,4 June 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how DR. NO rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: DR. NO, as a title, seems to be a pretty negative way to begin the series, but it is pithy and to the point and somewhat unforgettable. 7 points out of a possible 10.Pre-Credit Teaser: The only one of the Bond films with no opening act. 0 points.Opening Credits: Art director and graphic designer Maurice Binder's first crack at using the optical printer for a Bond film seems rather primitive by the standards his work would set with future Bond films and not even really on par with his work on other films from the same era, like CHARADE or TWO FOR THE ROAD. Colorful graphics of people dancing to Jamaican music is neither particularly sexy or exciting and could just as easily have been used to open any TV series of the era. He's obviously just getting a feel for the toy. 6 points.Theme Song: There is no official theme song for the film itself, but its introduction of Monty Norman's ""James Bond Theme"" is worth applauding, though it is hard to know just what to think of the use of a calypso version of ""Three Blind Mice."" 9 points.""Bond, James Bond"": Let's just say that while Sean Connery instantly was able to wear the role of James Bond with casual assurance, he had yet to allow his tongue to find its way into his cheek. Connery, like the film itself, takes himself a bit to seriously, even as the plot moves into the absurd. Count this as a trial run. 7 points.Bond Babes: I won't say that the bikini-clad image of Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder emerging from the ocean dripping wet is the primary reason for the first Bond adventure's box office success, but it sure didn't hurt. No, on second thought, I will say that Ursula's iconic image probably made the film cross over from being an okay movie to being the introduction of an international phenomenon. Her attempts to act, happily, didn't do too much harm. 10 points.Bond Villain: As Dr. No, Joseph Wiseman seems to be going for an attitude of inscrutable evil, but ends up coming closer to being numbingly comatose. I can't think of another Bond villain who seems to enjoy his evil less. Quite possibly the dullest Bond villain of all time. 1 point.Bond Baddies: Anthony Dawson as a jittery scientist is hardly worth noting as a henchman, but ""The Three Blind Mice,"" a hit squad of a trio of faux blind guys traveling around in an ancient black hearse, certainly give the film a much needed touch of whimsy. Otherwise Dr. No seems to be surrounded by the usual phalanx of nameless, faceless private soldiers. 6 points.Plot: Not that it matters, but the not-so-good Doctor is using radioactive waves to screw up the United States space program. Why really isn't that important. 5 points.Production Values: Maybe it is because Dr. No is supposedly Asian, but the film seems to have the look and the feel of a cheapo chop-socky or Godzilla flick. The first of the series was obviously low budget and the producers apparently had yet to develop the taste for gaudy excess. To put it bluntly, the film looks and feels tacky. Better things lay ahead for all involved. 4 points.Bonus Points: Let's be generous and allow an extra 5 points to the film for introducing to the world to both the phrase ""Bond, James Bond"" and the iconic image of the gun barrel framing image that defines the essence of Bondian danger.Summary: DR. NO is remarkable for being so absolutely unremarkable. Not a good movie, in and of itself, but a decent promise of things to come.Bond-o-meter Rating: 60 points out of a possible 100.",Dr. No
173,michaelarmer,Dr. No Shag,6,15 March 2020,"This looks a bit dated nowadays, especially when you look at a recent Bond film, but it was the first and the start of a great series.It is made in 1962, but it feels like it's in the fifties, Sean Connery is good as Bond, he gets better. Ursula Andress is ok, if a bit gormless as the bond girl, she is beautiful but not that sexy really. Joseph Wiseman is the weak link, he is supposed to be a good actor but his bad guy, wants to rule the world maniac is not great, and the character is supposed to be Chinese, he is Canadian and nothing like a Chinaman!! Jack Lord is good as Felix Leiter, in fact for me he is the definitive, and best in that role, no one has bettered him yet. It''s got Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell who were good and continued so, but no Desmond Llewelyn as Q, someone else plays Major Boothroyd (Q's real name & rank).
The storyline is a bit dodgy and the scenes not linking together good with several mistakes, and is a bit male chauvinist from those days, the women appear to be subordinate in it, photography is poor, located and filmed in Jamaica which is good, continuity is a bit poor, but action scenes good.Bond Themes:- There are several themes running through the franchise, things they use on several occasions, I will attempt to list the main ones, in this film, Casino Scene, his MI6 base/officers, Felix Leiter of the CIA, Spectre, Henchmen, not obvious in this one, the most muscular is Milton Reid who played Dr. No's guard (a Scot/Mongolian born in India, and who died there in mysterious circumstances), Professor Dent played by Anthony Dawson was sort of one but a bit weedy, then the 3 Blind Mice at the start, but they look like locally hired thugs.
Title Song:- this one had one but not a proper song, just a Caribbean ditty written by Monty Normand, male singer unknown. The music was great though and re-used in almost every Bond film.
Bond Girls :- everyone seems to think Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder was the first, she wasn't even 2nd. The first was Sylvia Trench played by a pretty Eunice Gayson (English) who later became his girlfriend in the next film, 2nd in my book is Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell - Canada), he didn't shag her, but had a sexual tension thing going with her throughout the franchise. The 3rd was Miss Taro (Zena Marshall - English/French) the most beautiful, but she is a baddie and dies soon after (another Bond theme), then came Honey Ryder (no.4) Ursula Andress who is Swiss not Swedish as many seem to think, Bond shagged her at the end.But it is exciting in parts and the bond formula is set, so it can't be that bad, despite non-authentic nationalities and dubbing.
And one thing to clarify, the first time 007 gets to order his Vodka Martini, it is mentioned that it is ""Mixed not Stirred"", it only becomes ""Shaken not Stirred"" later, in other films.",Dr. No
174,joelwatchesmovies,A good spy/detective plot comes to a mediocre end,7,23 May 2019,"A pleasantly paced detective/spy drama. Bond's predictable womanizing is eye-rolling but fortunately his cool and collected investigative work in the missing-person mystery takes center stage (""One takes cyanide, another would've stood for her arm being broken, neither would talk. Who puts that sort of scare into people?""). Bond's climactic convo with Dr. No is no cinematic slouch but the control-center action sequence to follow feels a little silly and the stakes aren't made clear.

175,malkane316,Quick Reviews!,7,25 January 2005,"As everyone knows, this is the first of the most successful movie franchise of all time, and is the perfect introduction to Bond- one of the most loved characters in movie history. Sean Connery is perfect in the role he made his own, able to be tough and cold in the face of the enemy, charming with women, and capable of delivering the one liners without making them sound cheesy. Bond travels to America to find the bad guy who the Americans could not, follows the clues which lead him to a Caribbean island, and encounters two important characters-Honey Ryder, his love interest, and Quarrel, a guide. As with every Bond film following, the secret agent comes in contact with one or two 'Bond Girls', and a friend who helps him complete his mission. The famous shot of Ursula Andress coming out of the sea may well have been outrageously sexy in the 60's, but has become extremely dated, or rather the audience has since become de-sensitised to images of a sexual nature. However, it remains the benchmark for the Bond Girl entrance, and Ryder is still one of the most famous women to grace Bond's world. She was certainly a strong female character for the era, but there is a definite sexist attitude towards her throughout the film, and we see that Bond's real sole purpose is to catch or kill the bad guy, and bring back information of SPECTRE.Quarrel is played brilliantly by John Kitzmiller, and although there are racist undertones, Bond is genuinely hurt when he is killed, and we see that Bond is a haunted character, and that people who come into his life will inevitably die or not stay around. We are introduce to Moneypenny, whose relationship with Bond has always been intriguing over the years, and his superior M, who constantly annoy each other but have a great mutual respect. Dr. No himself is a slightly weak character, partly because of his lack of screen time, and partly because he is not as charismatic or memorable as later bad guys. However, he is ruthless, and has the traits of most villains-pride, and an eye on world domination. His death scene is also weak, but perhaps this is because we are used to more elaborate scenes in later films. Overall the film is high quality entertainment, the script is sharp and tense, the tone is darker than other movies of the time, the music is memorable, and the stunts are good, leading the way for its sequels. 7 out of 10.",Dr. No
176,theshadow908,A great start to an amazing franchise.,8,22 November 2008,"Dr. No is the first film in the long running James Bond 007 franchise. In this film we are introduced to James Bond, a British secret agent with a license to kill. When an agent named John Strangways and his secretary are killed while stationed in Jamaica, Bond is sent there to investigate. He meets up with a CIA agent named Felix Leiter who helps him in his investigation, which leads them to a small island owned by a mysterious man named Dr. No. Bond suspects that Dr. No's activities on the island are criminal and may have something to do with the Strangways' disappearance. He and a local fisherman named Quarrel take a boat to Dr. No's island where they come across a local girl named Honey Ryder. They are captured and taken to Dr. No's lair, where Dr. No reveals he is working for SPECTRE, an organization bent on world domination. Now it's up to Bond to stop Dr. No in his tracks.When you watch this film, it seems so simple compared to what the series turned into down the line. This movie, while not my favourite Bond film, is a prime example of what a James Bond film should be. Bond doesn't use any gadgets in this film at all. He relies on his skill and his intelligence to get the mission done. Sean Connery plays the role perfectly, giving us a James Bond that has a sense of humour, but not too over the top with ridiculous one liners, and at the same time completely ruthless and deadly serious about his job. The film plays more on the espionage side of Bond's work rather than taking up too much time with ridiculous action sequences, and when the fight scenes and the climatic final action sequence do happen, they're exciting and not too over the top. One of my favourite moments in this film is when James Bond is sitting in a chair and he shoots a would be assassin twice, without any expression on his face. To me this says everything about who James Bond is and how he does his job.Now, I have to admit that even though I praise this film for being more about the espionage and less about the action, I do feel there could be more of a balance. If you're not in the mood this film can drag a little bit. I got 40 minutes into the movie and felt like it had to be halfway through, even though I was enjoying it. Also, Dr. No isn't the best Bond villain. He may have robotic hands capable of crushing a bronze statuette, but his first appearance isn't as menacing as it could be, his plan isn't really explained that well and his motives are weak, and his end is a little anti-climatic. All in all this is a good start to a franchise that would have its ups and downs over the years.8/10",Dr. No

179,OttoVonB,Bond number 1: a mind-boggling test run!,8,12 December 2006,"Bond's first cinema outing takes him to Jamaica, hunting for the criminal mastermind intent on disrupting US nuclear missile launches.After the series of books and a popular comic strip, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman joined efforts to create what, with time, would become one of the most beloved franchises of all time. Before the popularity, however, came this first film that would make or break the series. First of all, it is commendable that the producers understood Flemming's character and tone so well. That they managed to preserve and even enrich that tone with actors and visuals is a testament to their talent. The first and most important touch of genius was the hiring of relative unknown Sean Connery over more obvious choices like Roger Moore (then busy on ""The Saint""), Patrick McGoohan or Richard Johnson. Connery became the definitive James Bond.Director Terence Young was instrumental in crafting Connery's character and a general tone that would mark the entire series. Most ingredients are in place, even if the usual pre-titles sequence would only be introduced in ""From Russia with Love"". It is therefor easy to see how this film might have rocked the world when it premiered in 1962: the groovy music, the perfect balance of ruthless violence and style, thriller elements and adventure. The appeal of this intricate mix is still mostly intact after 4 decades, countless imitations and parodies and 20 films.It is hard to view ""Dr No"" as anything else than the first of the Bond films, but its qualities and its experimental roughness make it a fine spy adventure film. It is undeniably up there with the best of the series.",Dr. No
180,dvc5159,"""Three blind mice. See how they run in Kingston town""",7,13 June 2007,"With style, sophistication, and suaveness, Ian Fleming's most beloved character gets the well-deserved silver screen treatment for the first time in the form of Sean Connery, whose super stardom owes itself to his character. With this film, so begins the James Bond film franchise, which will impress, entertain and thrill audiences for years to come.Although part of the novel is cropped out for the film, Connery's powerful portrayal is probably what kept this film at bay. His intellectual wit and deadly charm is true to Fleming's original Bond. When he's talking, you wouldn't want to do anything else but just listen to him. When he's on the move, you wouldn't want to do anything else but just watch him do what he does best. His pronunciation of his most famous line ""Bond....James Bond"" is perhaps so full of ruggedness and class that it managed to find its way in my Top 5 Most Memorable Movie Quotes Ever.But Connery doesn't just share the spotlight. The gorgeous Ursula Andress is lovely as Honey Rider (I salute Fleming for giving names, especially Bond Girls"" and you would just stare at the screen and fantasize about her whenever you see her in that gorgeous bikini when she walks out of the water. Joseph Wiseman is just chilly as the megalomaniac villain of the title character Dr. No, whose plot for starting nuclear war for his own greediness still haunts viewers to this very day.The script simplifies the original novel, removing some key elements. However, with Connery's aforementioned acting and good directing courtesy of Terence Young, the story manges to stay afloat. However, having seeing this in the 21st century, it has become a tad bit outdated, compared to other Bonds like this.Nevertheless, it is still a classic and one that must remain for years to come. A must for any spy or James Bond fan.7.43/10Delton",Dr. No
181,tforbes-2,A great start!!!,10,4 November 2019,"""Dr. No"" marks the start of what would soon become a truly iconic film series that has lasted for decades. It began as a relatively low budget affair by United Artists, but so much was accomplished with that budget!First, Sean Connery makes his entrance as 007. He already had done a fair amount of acting, including the 1957 BBC adaptation of Rod Serling's ""Requiem For A Heavyweight."" Canadian actor Joseph Wiseman turns in a great performance as the title character, and James Bond's first major nemesis.And then we have the different ladies, beginning with Eunice Gayson and Lois Maxwell, all the way to Ursula Andress. Finally, we have the supporting players, including Jack Lord.""Dr. No"" lack the explosions and spectacle of later James Bond outings, and it's a better film for it, when it has such a good script and story line. One has to remember that John F. Kennedy was president and Harold Macmillan was UK prime minister when this was produced-nearly 60 years ago as of this writing. Given what the producers had to work with, they turned out a fine film!",Dr. No
182,TheHonestCritic,Here we have Bond's official debut on the big screen. Is it a good first impression?,4,3 October 2021,"""Dr. No"" (1962), while this may be the first official James Bond movie, it's not the first one in the series I saw, that distinction goes to ""Die Another Day"" (2002). Although, in the case of the Bond films, it really does not matter which one you start with, because they all have their own distinct story with very little to no connection. Being that this ""film"" was James Bond's debut onto the big screen, I was interested to see it for the first time. When I first watched it, I did like it somewhat. But, the more I saw it, the more the flaws stood out. This ""film"" has a convoluted and cliched story, standard to abysmal acting and dated special effects. The plot is, James Bond a.k.a. Agent 007, searches for evidence in an investigation involving the disappearance of a colleague and the disruption of the space program. At first glance, this story does sound a bit interesting. It may have complexities, but for an investigation plot, a complex story is warranted. The problem here is the execution itself. Normally, for a movie to work, it should be consistent with it's tone. ""Dr. No"" is all over the place with it's plot. It goes from serious, to comedic, to over the top and throws in hints of espionage. That's way too much for a story like this one. Unless you can keep everything cohesive with the plot line, the result will be an inevitable mess. Had ""Dr. No"" stuck with one, maybe two genres, then it might have been better. A lot of movies have multiple genres blended together. In the world of Bond films, the majority of them are action mixed with comedic moments. That being said, ""Dr. No"" is all over the place with it's writing, as it does not stick with one tone throughout. There's even a brief song, which is sung by Honey Ryder, played by Ursula Andress and James Bond, played by Sean Connery. When, at any point, was this ""movie"" labeled as a musical? Another issue is the abundance of unresolved sub-plots. That just gives me an incomplete feeling when I watch it. With a runtime of 109 minutes, it's one of the shortest Bond films of the series. The average Bond film is two hours plus, which is what this one should have been. With a few additional scenes, everything in the story would have tied together. Even though it's one of the shortest movies in the franchise, it feels like it drags on forever. Even the climax is a letdown! The death of the main villain, Dr. Julius No, played by Joseph Wiseman, is underwhelming and the action is generic and unoriginal. Overall, the story is just a huge disappointment. There are a few decent moments here and there. One of my favorite parts is where James Bond introduces himself to the audience for the first time. When he says his iconic line: ""Bond, James Bond."" Little parts like that are redeemable, but all in all, the execution is what brought it down. As for the acting, it's just as big a letdown as the plot. The only actors that are putting forth any effort are: Sean Connery as James Bond, Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder, Bernard Lee as M and Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny. As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they are just average to horrible. Even Joseph Wiseman's performance as Dr. No was dull! When the main villain is uninteresting, then you know it's a problem. As for the special effects, most of them are well-done, especially for it's time. However, there is a good handful that are dated, cheesy and have not aged well. Now, let's get to the only two positives in this ""movie"", which are the sets/locations and the soundtrack. All of the sets/locations are stunning and give the ""movie"" a beautiful atmosphere. Usually, Bond films are known for their use of exotic locations, and ""Dr. No"" is a perfect candidate for that. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Monty Newman is well-done. Unfortunately, the film score seems to be trying harder than anything else! But at the end of the day, I still give it a pass. ""Dr. No"" may be the first Bond movie of the official series. Unfortunately, it's not a great first impression. The ironic thing is, this ""movie"" highlights the series as a whole, case-in-point, a mixed bag. While the Bond franchise does have it's share of good films, it also has it's share of bad films. ""Dr. No"" includes everything good and bad that every Bond movie has to offer, but mostly bad. I rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. To wrap things up, let's have a moment of silence for the late, but great Sean Connery (R. I. P.) He will always be the best James Bond actor! If you're looking to get into Bond movies, I suggest skipping this ""movie"" until later. I recommend you begin with either of my top five favorite Bond films. Then, if you want, feel free to check out ""Dr. No"" if you like. As for me, ""Dr. No"" is a movie that I just say ""no"" to.",Dr. No
183,disinterested_spectator,Less Is More,9,26 November 2014,"When we first see Sean Connery in this movie, he is at a casino playing chemin-de-fer against a beautiful woman. She asks him what his name is, and we hear him say, ""Bond, James Bond,"" while he lights a cigarette, accompanied by his theme music. Oh, to be that cool! It makes you ache with envy.When he is called back to the office, he is given no gadgets, only a Walther PPK to replace his Beretta, which the man from Q-branch refers to as suitable for a lady's handbag. It makes you realize what the series could have been if only each successive film had not been compelled to try to dazzle the audience with gadgetry.The movie is more realistic than future Bond movies, especially in the way that on a couple of occasions he is careful to keep the enemy from getting a photograph of him. By the second film, ""From Russia with Love,"" his face is well-known to the enemy, which in real life would have meant a desk job from then on. Furthermore, in some of the later Bond movies, he is so blasé about threats to his life, we never really feel as though he is in danger. In this movie, after he kills the spider that was crawling up his arm while he was in bed, he goes into the bathroom and vomits, giving us the sense that he was really scared. Had that sort of scene occurred in a later Bond movie, he would simply have made a wisecrack.Later on, he exercises his license to kill. For the first time in the history of cinema, the good guy commits a totally unnecessary, cold-blooded murder. He could easily have called the Jamaican police and had the man, Professor Dent, arrested. After all, he had the police come to the same house a few hours before to pick up the beautiful woman who lured him there, so the police already knew the way. And they could have interrogated Dent for information about Dr. No. So the killing is not only gratuitous, but also unrealistic. And yet, it is a great scene. In this case, the wisecrack, ""That's a Smith & Wesson, and you've had your six,"" uttered just before he calmly puts a couple of slugs into his helpless victim, perfectly suits the situation. The silencer he uses for this execution is probably a little gratuitous as well, for the house appears to be remote, but it adds to his overall sang froid, for there is something extra sinister about silencers.In many ways, this is the best Bond movie ever made.",Dr. No

It Seems Strangways found the source of the radio waves coming from a island called Crab Key which is owned by a mysterious man named DR.No. Soon Bond investigates and after many attempts on his life Bond goes to crab key and Encounters two remarkable people one is Honeyshile Ryder wonderfully played by Ursula Andress the other is DR.NO himself. DR.No is in the employ of SPECTRE a organization dedicated to extortion terrorism and revenge. DR.No is a sadist and he likes to torture his enemies and this time he met his match in Bond. the movie has everything thrills Chills excitement action and adventure. DR.NO is a grand old time for the entire family I first met James Bond when I was ten I'm now forty and the excitement of Bond still has not worn off and I believe it never will. Despite everything this is still very much Sean Connery's movie and he knows it and he gives us everything we want in a screen hero. Connery once said that everyone claims he made playing Bond look easy and effortless but he said it took a lot of work to CREATE Bond to make him a likable hero to make Bond a hero that would last generations.

185,mnpollio,"Nice start, but has not aged as well as others",7,22 March 2007,"I am a huge Bond fan, but like everyone else I favor some over others. Truth be told, I am much more tolerant of a sub-par Bond film than I am of a sub-par genre film. While it is difficult to look back and try to imagine the impact that Dr. No must have had in its day, it is far less difficult to admit that time has dimmed its impact. Other than its claim to be the first in the series and thus setting up the ingredients for future, better Bond films, it is a pleasant time-filler, but not a landmark event. What works: Bond: Sean Connery is excellent in the role for which he is most associated with and creates the basis upon which all followers would be measured. He superbly captures the suave machismo, the cold-blooded nature and deadpan humor, which actually makes the character more appealing than the one existing in Ian Fleming's pages.Villain: Dr. No is a weak and forgettable villain. It is hard to take him particularly seriously as he seems like a reject from a Get Smart episode of an old Fu Manchu film. We never get the sense that the heroes are in any real danger from him and his nefarious plot is dull.Women: Ursula Andress became an icon with her unforgettable and sultry entrance rising from the sea in her bikini. It is a memorable moment. Unfortunately, her character has no real tie to the action and she spends the remainder of the film in the background as eye candy. There is not much of a character here for her to play.Conclusion: A great starting point, but not one of the best of the series due to a sub-par villain and an underused female lead. Connery's bravura performance carries the day and expert direction carry the day and set the tone for the rest of the series. It is a bit bizarre to see a radically different credits sequence and no real Bond song.

Upon re-watching it, I appreciated it more, but 'Dr No' takes far too long to introduce the title character- played by Joseph Wiseman- as well as introducing the audience to Honey Ryder, played by the gorgeous Ursula Andress. The film does establish Sean Connery's stamp on the role of James Bond, as we get to see his roguish charm on display, and of course we have the iconic ""My name is Bond, James Bond"" casino scene at the beginning, as well as establishing the whole universe of James Bond 007.My other gripe with this film is the Three Blind Mice assassins who disappear completely without any resolution. Anyway, 'Dr No' is definitely worth-watching, particularly because it was the first Bond movie.*** out of *****!",Dr. No
188,EvanKevelson,Made me curious enough for Russia with love,7,26 February 2021,"Personally when I rate a Bond Film a rate it only in the context of all Bond Films pre-Daniel Craig (being he is a reboot not a continuity Bond). These aren't deep message films they are action films based on a covert MI-6 agent whose missions are to infiltrate, gather Intel and kill when necessary. The Rating also has to be looked at From a historical perspective not only factually but sociological norms of that particular era.
So if I see a review that depicts racism(lack of black characters) or depiction of Connery or Moore as a sick misogynistic animal... I know the reviewer is ignorant of what audiences where pleased by between 1962-1977 etc... They also are just as fanatic in liberal ideology as a religious conservative fanatics. These were till 1973 ""Guy Films"" not date films.
Criticizing Bond on a ""morality"" basis is the same as criticizing looney tunes for excessive violence. It's moronic.
This film unlike most Bonds wasn't bad and was the test drive for Bond films to come, it was somewhat of a slow burn and played it relatively safe in n the sex and violence department compared to its successors.
This film definitely awakens curiosity and motivates one to want to see more Bond. Not phenomenal but entertaining and solidifying the character. From Connery's six appearances I'd rank this at 4 (and 4th best from 1964-2002).",Dr. No
189,dasa108,Charming with the archetype of the secret agent that marked our lives,8,21 August 2021,"It is a movie made with charm and with wonderful Connery full of charisma. Here we see Bond in all his splendor; It is not difficult to imagine the reason why he became the archetype of the world hero. From the photography, the music, the supporting characters and the super talent of Connery to give us the best Bond possible ... the list of excellent things in this film is as long as the history of the saga has been.Almost 60 years later, this film remains valid. That's why it's a great movie, full of humor and iconic moments.",Dr. No
190,bwaynef,The least pretentious of the series,8,28 March 1999,"The least pretentious of the series, although I have to say the pretentiousness is one of the qualities I liked about some of the later 60's films.  One of the reasons this one seems down to earth is that music score by Monty Norman.  Not only is it run of the mill, and completely lacking the exciting, unique mood of John Barry's brilliant work for the series, most of the better selections on the official soundtrack album aren't even in the movie.  Still, this is a pretty terrific movie, and includes one of the best scenes from the series:  Bond's cold-blooded killing of the assassin in the hotel room  (""That's a Smith and Wesson.  You've had your six"").",Dr. No

192,patriciogl10,The first of firsts.,9,18 September 2018,"What a perfect introduction to one of the most iconic characters in film history. And what a way to start it
with probably the only actor who did the character true justice, Sean Connery. He truly understood what the
character was all about. I love how coherent yet simple the plot is; Bond takes us through an espionage journey
where he successfully outsmarts his first real villain, Dr. No. Ursula Andress looks fantastic as Honey Ryder
even though not much is done with her character.Some of the sets and effects may seem dated, but the action while not explosive is still highly entertaining.
Another thing I found interesting was that the villain and the bond girl were not introduced at the beginning
of the film, but in the second act almost reaching the third. I enjoyed the way it was put together, to me it 
flowed seamlessly.This is a must-see! You will meet the first of firsts that later reached iconic status and made it the immense
film franchise that is still going strong. Enjoy!",Dr. No
193,stormhawk2021,A legend is born,9,26 June 2017,"The bond film to start all bond films. ""Dr. No"" is the type of spy film that you just cannot dislike, because the cleverness will cloud any doubt. Sean Connery kicks off the series with a bang, creating an atmosphere that I loved to death. This film is about agent OO7 and his assignment where he is sent across country where he comes into contact with an evil doctor. This plot is not wholly original nowadays, but for it's time, it is unbeatable. ""Dr. No"" boasts fantastic acting, a great script, and some pretty intense scenes. There was never a dull moment in this film, or any moment for that matter that made me bored. This film is well paced and the pay-off is excellent. This James Bond film is not one to miss!",Dr. No
194,ragosaal,A Real Impressive Start,9,29 September 2006,"Film and Bond fans sort of overlook this first movie or have it just as the one that started the successful series. I disagree; in my opinion, this is one of the very best. It's true that Sean Connery gained confidence in the role as sequels went by, but even so no other Bond performer could ever match him as the famous British Agent. No one came even close to the sarcastyc elegance Connery gave to the character.Aside from the plot and the high spectacle both very good for the early 60's, ""Dr. No"" shows perfectly right from the start who Bond really is: a hired killer (and a very professional one too). The sequence when he shoots Anthony Dawson needlessly and in cold blood for he has no more use for him is anthological. It also shows that Bond doens't forgive those who menace him (Dawson tried cowardly to shoot him right before).Bond's other aspects such as his fascination for beautiful women and for the best things in life -according to his parameters- such as gambling in high class casinos, exclusive clubs, sophysticated drinks and powerful cars, are here too. He lies without a muscle moving in his face if he has to.In my opinion this is one of Bond's best even including the other films where Connery played the part all of them better than the rest. Don't let it go if you didn't see it!",Dr. No
195,jonathanruano,A Great Villain + A Great Bond + Lots of Suspense = A Great Experience,9,21 August 2010,"Director Terence Young's first Bond film, ""Dr. No,"" is an almost first class film. Sean Connery is so ideally cast as James Bond that he literally made the role his own and made it very difficult, if not impossible, for his successors (George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timophy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig) to match his achievement. The various adjectives that critics and audience members attribute to James Bond - cool, charismatic, womanizing, intellectually gifted, and handsome - are due almost solely to Sean Connery's fine work in the 1960s as James Bond.Yet ""Dr. No"" has a lot more going for it than just a winning lead. Director Terence Young and the screen writers Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather construct big scenes for the lead actor, Sean Connery. Some of these big scenes, which go far in making this film incredibly entertaining, have become iconic. For example, the scene where James Bond introduces himself to Sylvia Trench (Eunice Gayson), while gambling at cards for high stakes and smoking a cigarette, has become perhaps the most memorable scene in a James Bond picture along with the simple, but catchy phrase, ""Bond... James Bond."" But there are many other big scenes - Bond's flirtation with the secretary Miss Moneypenny, the attempted assassinations (one involving a killer spider), and the meeting with Dr. No (who is played very effectively by Joseph Wiseman) - that are just as thrilling as the first one.While watching ""Dr. No"" yet again, I was also reminded by how well James Bond films were made back in the 1960s. Today Bond films and other action pictures contain so many special effects that they end up crowding out the film's human characters. Yet director Terence Young and his crew choose to focus most of their attention on the film's plot and characters and the result, not surprisingly, is a much better film. The scenes that show James Bond's detective work (which are mercifully not interrupted by explosions and other loud special effects) in finding who killed Professor Strangways are as good as they come. This film also has the distinction of creating memorable characters for the actors who have small parts. Zena Marshall, for example, had a relatively small role as the secretary Miss Taro. But Miss Taro is memorable not only for the diabolical way she tries to lure James Bond to his death (usually the long route to her home as bait), but also for using her charms and sexuality to keep the hero in her bed for the next two hours so that he could be gunned down by an assassin. An actor with a small part could hardly expect a more interesting than that. Joseph Wiseman's Dr. No similarly had few scenes throughout this picture, but his appearance was so striking and his performance so chilling that he is fondly remembered as one of the great Bond villains. Lastly Terence Young and his assistants have set the standard for quality control that the Bond pictures have largely followed ever since. The ""Bond girls"" are all stunning, which often makes them as memorable as James Bond. Honey Rider (Ursula Andress) may not have the most memorable lines (though the one about the praying mantis remains in my mind), but who can forget that scene where she emerges on the beach with her shells and goggles? Finally the locations are wisely chosen. The reason why ""Dr. No"" and other Bond movies are so effective as escapist entertainment is largely because they take James Bond to exotic locations like Jamaica with its palm trees, gorgeous beaches, and cheerful Latin American music. The only possible flaw in ""Dr. No,"" which has become a hallmark in James Bond films ever since, is the ""fallacy of the talking killer."" Dr. No had plenty of opportunities towards the end of the movie to put a bullet through James Bond's head and end the whole series right then and there, but for one reason or the other he never gets around to doing it. The chief villain's scheme to kill James Bond (it appears) always has to be elaborate and complex; so complex, in fact, that James Bond is able to escape imminent destruction and live another day.",Dr. No
196,Rindiana,Say Yes to Dr. No,6,15 June 2009,"It's all Sean Connery's show. His Bond still stands head and shoulders above all the following incarnations. He's charmingly menacing and menacingly charming, just as believable as both killer and love-maker, while imbuing every on-screen moment with subtle ironic detachment. Lazenby's short intervention lacked zing, Moore was too jokey and ill-fitted for action scenes, Dalton didn't even bother, Brosnan was too superficially handsome and slick, and contemporary 007 Craig is just a boring robot going through the motions.The first Bond outing may not be the best - it looks quite cheap in instances, clever set-pieces as well as later trademarks are sorely missing and the plot feels restricted -, but it's an okay spy adventure anyway.6 out of 10 prosthetic hands",Dr. No
197,TheHande,Another great Bond,8,14 December 2005,"Though not as polished as it's followers the first Bond is regardless a fun and quite charming film. The plot, though a bit stripped down, is still colorful enough to keep one's interest and various parts of the film seemed surprisingly contemporary (even though the film was made back in '62). Connery gives off a typically excellent performance, being boyish but tough at the same time.Regardless, the film's most obvious weaknesses include an occasionally slip-shot continuity and a particularly unspectacular car-chase. However, the film has a great villain and though its usage was rather inconsistent the soundtrack was also quite nice.The spider-part of the film is something I'm very conflicted about as I tend to find it quite hilarious yet as can be told from the music it's intended to be quite dramatic.Despite some obvious weaknesses it's nice to see how little the movie has dated and it is still an extremely enjoyable film.",Dr. No
198,antagonist117,"A modest, adequate beginning to a franchise",6,19 June 2013,"Compared to later Bond films, this first effort is smaller in scope and rough around the edges. Terence Young seems determined to place the camera in awkward positions that reveal little of the beautiful Jamaican scenery. Characters and plot threads, such as a shady female photographer who trails Bond from the airport to a nightclub, are left unresolved. I think seeing it at the time of its release would have felt like a disappointment for fans of the more tightly-structured, moodier Bond novels. In retrospect, however, one can identify moments that helped create the feel of the Bond universe, such as the decision (apparently a source of debate behind the scenes) to have Bond shoot an unarmed opponent in cold blood. The use of music is different than in later films, with the iconic theme playing over uneventful action such as Bond casing his hotel room, but this actually helps elevate the tension in places where the film might otherwise lag. The car chase scene and the post-title sequence that sets up the plot are also strong points.",Dr. No
199,HenryHextonEsq,"Fine, even dandy, if one likes this sort of thing",6,15 June 2001,"Coming to this film relatively fresh in terms of number of Bond films seen, I was able to judge it fairly, if not fully, objectively. There was much that was familiar, from various imitations and spoofs, c.f. ""Austin Powers"". The plot was steady, if hardly engrossing, and it often meandered into the admittedly tempting waters of stylized violence and simmering sex appeal. The women ""on show"" are indeed of a pleasing aspect, and much of the violence is well conveyed, but it all distracts in an ultimately pointless, superficial way. The Jamaica locations are truly sublime, and the photography I do quite like; there's nothing much to quibble over in visual terms. The characters only occasionally interest. Remembering the famed Bond is effectively a new screen character here, I'd say he was efficiently portrayed by Connery, but the character, as has been said, is very uninteresting and basic. A few decent lines, a fine dress sense and a nigh on physical invincibility and perfection, do not a character make. Joseph Wiseman is good in his brief role as the eponymous Doctor, but his role could have done with a bit more depth. The Bond girls seem here to lack vocation in the plot. Much has been made of the Bond films' wit, but frankly there's not enough of it here. It really needed more of the winning humorous touch of, for example, ""The Avengers"" TV show of the mid-sixties... a show that took similar material more lightly and dexterously. Overall, a moderately enjoyable escapist slice of adventure, with, as is the case for films like ""Star Wars"", a largely negative influence on the future of film making. Rating:- ***/*****",Dr. No
200,talisencrw,A fine first edition for Connery and Co.!,9,23 August 2016,"An extraordinary manifesto for not just the longest-running film series to date, but for an entire genre. People often forget just how important in the grand scheme of things a first film is, and how it was so requisite that Sean Connery had to be just right, the Bond girls, the action, music cues, opening scene, credits sequence, etc. Even though recently, Daniel Craig has at least captivated audiences to almost the same extent, he only reminded me of Connery's endearing qualities, and through completely lacking humour and charisma, simply showed by omission why Connery (who had already made five films as Bond before Craig was even born) was so essential in the first place.Watching my blu from the complete Bond boxed set, it wasn't dated or a lesser experience for me in the slightest.

202,rparham,"The ""Dr"" is in",8,7 November 2006,"It's difficult to imagine today, but there was a time that the general public was familiar with the character of James Bond principally through a series of novels written by British author Ian Fleming. All that changed in 1962 with the release of Dr. No, the first of 20 official James Bond movies and the beginning of a motion picture phenomenon that cannot be equaled for longevity or staying power. But at the start there was Dr. No, which was a strong Bond entry, but not quite the pop icon that the latter films would be.Dr. No opens in Jamaica, where a British secret agent and his assistant are murdered by three assassins posing as blind men. When the main organization, MI6, discovers the situation, M (Bernard Lee), the head of MI6, dispatches agent James Bond (Sean Connery), designation 007, to Jamaica to investigate. Bond quickly discovers that the agent was investigating some irregularities with American space rocket launches being disrupted that were possibly originating from the area. With the assistance of FBI agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) and local fisherman Quarel (John Kitzmiller), Bond begins to track the problem to a local island named Crab Key that all locals avoid because of fears of the island. Bond, certain that Crab Key is where he needs to go, sets out to discover the secret of the island, and it's mysterious owner, Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman).Compared to the later Bond films, Dr. No is very much a proto-James Bond film, putting a few of the key elements in place, but not quite cementing the formula that the series would become famous for. Missing are the flashy gadgets, the elaborate action sequences and the pre-title teaser, making Dr. No look a little underpowered when sized up against its follow-ups. Dr. No is more reliant on investigation and sneaking around than the series would employ eventually, but this also helps ground the film more than much of the Bond canon. Sure, there are some coincidences that are a bit remarkable, the villain is megalomaniacal and comes complete with a private army and elaborate hideout, but Dr. No doesn't quite push the levels of credulity that some of the Bond films do; it is practically restrained when stacked up against such entries as Moonraker and The Spy Who Loved Me.This lack of flashiness doesn't make for a bad film, and it comes across as a more serious film than its pedigree would suggest, and in fact features at least one scene that has been noted for portraying a harder edge to the character of Bond than most fans believe that Fleming would have been comfortable with. There is intrigue, double-crossing and secrets that unfold with the story that keep you involved with the story all the way through. However, the pacing is a bit sluggish at times, especially in the middle section of the film, as Bond, Quarel and exotic beauty Honey Rider (Ursula Andress), who had been shell collecting at the island, explore crab key with Dr. No's henchmen on their tail. The film does seem to drag a bit at this point, but it is hardly detrimental to the overall enjoyment.One thing that Dr. No does marvelously is introduce the audience to the man who would become the symbol of James Bond to millions of moviegoers the world over: Sean Connery. Despite not being Fleming's first choice for the role, Connery would prove to be indispensible in the role and he made the character his own. His good looks, ability to mix seriousness with a sly side and his absolute perfect delivery of his lines, especially the double entendres that would become the Bond signature, made Connery a star and no other actor has come close to touching his portrayal of Bond. A significant portion of Dr. No's success can be laid at the foot of Connery, and he delivers the goods. Wiseman provides the first of a long line of Bond villains, and while he doesn't prove to be quite up to some of the later ones, he still manages to create a memorable adversary, with a voice that communicates both menace and calm at the same time. Ursula Andress would be the first of many ""Bond girls"", and she does a good job, making Honey Rider feisty and sexy at the same time.Dr. No is not the pinnacle of the Bond experience, but as a first step where the filmmakers were finding their way, it works well and paves the road for future, greater entries. Dr. No was the birth of a cinematic dynasty, and while not the crown jewel, it has earned its place in the display case.",Dr. No
203,dobbin-4,So This Is Where The James Bond Movie Series Began...,7,25 November 2008,"I have set the goal to watch one of the Bond films every week and of course I had to start with this one (I could not find the Climax! 1954 episode in time) and I must say that this Bond is extremely different (I do have a point don't write me off as an idiot) even to the other Bond films that connery did. First of all the start sequence is very different and so is the famous gun barrel scene. There is also the very bizarre three blind mouse scene that had me confused if it had any actually relevance to the movie for a second there.Anyway in this film James Bond in in Jamaica looking for a colleague when he follows the clues and ends up on an island where evil genius Dr. No is scheming to end the US space program but of course Bond wont let that go without a fight and together with the first ever Bond girl (Ursula Andress) as Honey Rider (A very sweet name according to Sean) and a local who is helping him and together they team up to destroy the evil genius that is Dr. No.While the film is different you can hardly blame this film or the following films to blame for that. The action in this is slower compared to the action of the other Connery films and their is more casual banter between good and evil in this movie.Overall, this film is good. I recommend it highly to any James Bond fan who has not seen this for any reason. It is good to see how far the series has come and I look forward to week 2 of the James Bond weekly marathon. I rate this one 66%.",Dr. No
204,monkeysgalore,Where It All Began,7,16 October 2019,"This was the second Bond film I think I saw, the first being the awesome ""Casino Royale"". I admittedly probably shouldn't have started with any of the Craig films, as it's harder to appreciate the older ones if you do. The older ones are a lot of fun, but they're more slowly paced, and the action sequences aren't as plentiful, or as advanced, by today's standards. But for the 60s and 70s, they were ahead of their time, and they're still a ton of fun for me, regardless of how well they hold up.""Dr. No"" is the first film in the franchise, released in 1962. It's the first film in the franchise, but it's based on the 6th book in the franchise (written by Ian Fleming), and one which received a lot of criticism as well. I haven't read the book, although I have read several Bond novels, but from what I've read review-wise, the film seems to mostly stick to the source material.The plot: James Bond, agent 007 of the British secret service, is sent to find out what happened to a missing fellow agent, and the trail leads him to Jamaica, where he tangles with Dr. No, an evil scientist bent on disrupting an American space launch.The story itself is interesting, though it probably could've moved along a little more quickly, but I did appreciate how much time was taken to really develop the story. That is an aspect of the earlier Bonds that's really nice, is how much story and layers of complexity there were to the plots, at least, the first few Connery films. The script was written by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather. Richard Maibaum became a veteran writer for the Bond films, doing the scripts for the majority of the earlier ones, and he really is gifted. This film, and the others, are very well thought out and imaginative, and Maibaum and the others adapt the original book well for the screen. The plot does seem to stall at times, but overall there's a lot of plot that builds, and makes the climax more anticipated. This film came before the ""Bond Formula"" was fully realized, and all the nuances of it aren't present here, but this is definitely where it started.Terence Young had an excellent directorial showing here, capably and effectively handling the action scenes and the character development. His style was very influential on future films in the series, and he is definitely one of, if not the, best directors to handle a James Bond film.There are a few action sequences in this film, though, if you're an action junkie this might not be for you. The action comes only when necessary, and only as a device to move the plot along. Unlike many of the later Bond films, there aren't any overblown, extended scenes, and much of the action happens quickly. There's a brief fight scene between Bond and an assassin, the metal dragon scene on the beach, and the final fight scene. In between are a few short moments, and the movie is surprisingly violent for a film in 1962. Bond kills a man with a knife offscreen, a man is set on fire and dies, Bond shoots a man several times in cold blood (which became one of the most infamous and memorable kills in the series), etc. The violence isn't shocking by today's standards, but I was surprised at some of the blood and brutality present for the time, but the Bond films again were very ahead of their time in terms of action and violence, and the violence portrayed here still doesn't quite reach the levels of gritty and at times graphic violence seen in Ian Fleming's novels.The film was even dismissed at the time by a lot of critics due to the violence, because as I said, the film was ahead of its time. The Vatican even took shots at the film, saying it was ""a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex"", which probably isn't inaccurate, though this film is nowhere near as close to that template as some of the newer Bond films (the 1962 Vatican reviewer would've had a heart attack had he seen any of the Craig or Brosnan films). The film's reception at the time was generally mixed, but over time, it's been reappraised as one of the series' best entries, which is also accurate.Many Bond tropes were instituted here, including, the diabolical villain with overblown plans, and the gorgeous female sidekick, known colloquially as ""Bond girls"". In this case, they are Dr. No, who is a very memorable villain, equal parts stoic and sadistic. He is cold and calculating, and he is brutal, either following through, or at least attempting, to torture Bond and his companion on different occasions. It's especially interesting how much of an impact he had on the Bond films and the action/spy genre in general, especially since he doesn't even appear in the film until about 2/3 of the way through. The girl is Honey Rider, one of the most memorable Bond girls, and probably one of the most developed, and she too doesn't appear until closer to the film's climax. Other institutions here are the villain's large base with many jump suit-clad henchmen, and the opening song and the iconic gun barrel opening, both very creative, which are just more testaments to how ahead of its time this film was. Oh, and ""Bond, James Bond"", one of the greatest film lines ever.Sean Connery did very well, and he really is a great Bond. I've seen all the films by now and am still trying to decide my personal ranking of the actors, but it's pointless to get caught up in that debate. Regardless of his successors, Connery is still great, and put his stamp on the character here. He was the first, he made the character his own, and he gave a great performance. Ursula Andress was pretty good, though apparently Nikki van der Zyl did her lines, and she just mouthed them, I don't know why. Joseph Wiseman did an excellent job as Dr. No, and created a really iconic villain, and his cold glares and short lines were delivered well.The character of James Bond here is very interesting, and really embodies the character imagined in Fleming's novels, equal parts cultured gentleman and badass trained killer. He is lighthearted and sardonic at times, and cold and ruthless at others, and Connery managed to balance these well, giving the character a subtle nuance. Three Bond regulars first appear here as well. The first is Q, called Mr Boothroyd here (played by Peter Burton), who supplies 007 with all of his gadgets and toys. The others are M (played by Bernard Lee), Bond's no nonsense superior, and Mrs. Moneypenny (played by Lois Maxwell), M's flirtatious and interesting secretary.Overall, I thought it was great, and it did go on to spawn a 25 (26 if you count ""Never Say Never Again"") film series, all of which are entertaining. This was a fun movie, slow at times, and it's also pretty dated by today's standards, but that doesn't take away from how innovative and entertaining it is. I am a huge Bond fan, and I highly recommend this movie to fans, and if you're not a fan, you should still check it out. It's an essential piece of pop culture and film history, and well worth your time.",Dr. No
205,vranger,A true original,9,3 April 2009,"This was Bond as it always should be. The first few Bond movies were quite close to the original Fleming novels, and Dr. No led it off.Bond is cool, sexy, and somewhat cold, as when he goes to bed with a female foil and then amusedly hands her over to the local cops.Somehow, Bond is mis-identified as a 'secret' agent, because I can't recall too many situations where his status as an agent remained unidentified for long. Dr. No is no exception. The bad guys have a line on him as soon as he arrives on the island, literally, and it never stops from there.Some of the younger 'vidoe game movie' set may find Dr. No somewhat tame for their tastes.

This is where the James Bond franchise began after all.However, it has not worn too well.Certain moments such as the introduction of Connery as Bond and Ursula Andress's emerging from the sea have become iconic. But there is all too much which is of its time, creaking plot points, poor special effects and dull sequences which would be improved upon in later films.Probably the most exciting thing that happens is a tarantula in Bond's bed. And this adversary he defeats with his shoe. Its not entirely clear why an intelligent girl like Andress is spending her whole time collecting shells in such a dangerous location (there are easier ways for her to make money) or why she believes in dragons. Another curious part is why she and Bond are pointlessly drugged by coffee while in Dr No's captivity. This seems to be merely that Dr. No can gawk at Bond when asleep. The finale is the most disappointing part of all. Bond foils No's plot by merely turning a stopcock. The final battle with the doctor lasts about 20 seconds before the villain falls in boiling water. Totally anti-climatic.Watching it today, my guess is that young people will wonder what the fuss was about.",Dr. No
207,bbhlthph,"A ""must see"" that remains fairly enjoyable",5,21 August 2003,"James Bond films have now acquired a cult following which makes it hard to view them objectively. They always tend to be regarded as either a ""must see"" movie or a prime example of one which is in the three G's category. (Gadgets, girls and garbage). The author, Ian Fleming, was not particularly proud of his Bond novels. He regarded them as good money spinners, but not as examples of the type of literature for which he would wish to be remembered. In practice however they were mostly competent portrayals of life lived outside the law as an international spy, and were probably the best written set of such novels to have ever been penned. The early Bond films were reasonably faithful attempts to screen the novels as written, and most critics still appear to regard them as the best of these films. Unfortunately many younger viewers got captivated by the special effects, and demanded more such films with faster and faster action and better and better spectacles. The legend quickly took over and Ian Fleming slipped into the background, to eventually disappear - concurrently for many of us the quality of the films themselves slumped to zero. As the first Bond film, Dr. No will always hold a special place. It was produced on a very limited budget with only moderate expectations of success so the gadgetry was minimal. Ursula Andress has an established reputation as an actress and was not the typical later Bond girl. There was some attempt to show real characters engaged in believable activities, and relative to the later Bond films the garbage rating is therefore very low. All in all this is quite a significant film, not because of what it is but because of what has evolved from it over the years. It is therefore a ""must see"" for anyone interested in the history of the cinema, but even for those who do not have this interest it still remains a fairly enjoyable film to watch.",Dr. No
208,BumpyRide,Madame Yes,8,7 March 2006,"It seems people tend to pass over this movie, perhaps unintentionally only because it wasn't as splashy as ""Goldfinger"" or the cosmic disaster called ""Moonraker."" Dr. No is a little rough around the edges but that's to be expected since this was the first Bond on the big screen but all the successful elements were already in place. Sticking closely to the book for the most part, this flick offered up a maniacal villain with a fabulous secret base complete with guests suites and torture chambers! And you thought Sandals had everything you could ever want. The first half of the movie is somewhat grounded in reality while the second half almost turns into a living comic book. I don't mind this but it almost seems like two different movies. Connery makes a good first impression playing Bond as smooth and sleek as his Walther PPK. What this franchise did that was smart was to build upon each of the early movies success while increasing their budgets. If only they would have stayed on track.",Dr. No
209,garyldibert,Ursula Andress is Gorgeous,10,16 July 2012,"TITLE: Dr. No was Release October 5, 1962 and the runtime on this movie was 109 minutes. Dr. No (1962), starring Sean Connery, is the first James Bond film. Based on the 1958 Ian Fleming novel of the same name, it was adapted by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather and was directed by Terence Young. The film was produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, a partnership that would continue until 1975. In the film, James Bond is sent to Jamaica on an investigation into the death of a fellow British agent. The murder trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. Julius No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American manned space launch with a radio beam weapon. Although the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, Dr. No was not the first of Fleming's novels, Casino Royale being the debut for the character. However, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books, such as M presenting him with his better-known Walther PPK. Dr. No was produced with a low budget, but was a financial success. While critical reaction at release was mixed, over time the film received a reputation as one of the franchise's best installments. The film was followed by a successful series with currently 22 films and a 23rd planned for release in 2012. Dr. No also launched a successful genre of ""secret agent"" films that flourished in the 1960s. Many of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in Dr. No, beginning with what is known as the gun barrel sequence. The film begins with an introduction to the character through the view of a gun barrel, and a highly stylized main title sequence, both created by Maurice Binder. In his work on film, production designer Ken Adam established a unique and expansive visual style that is one of the hallmarks of the Bond film series.SUMMARY: John Strangways, the British Intelligence (SIS) Station Chief in Jamaica, is ambushed, killed, and his body taken by three assassins known as the ""Three Blind Mice."" In response, MI6 agent James Bond (007) is summoned to the office of his superior, M. Bond is briefed to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his cooperation with the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of Cape Canaveral rocket launches by radio jamming. Upon his arrival at Kingston Airport, a female photographer tries to take Bond's picture and he is shadowed from the airport. A chauffeur, who Bond determines to be an enemy agent, picks him up. Bond instructs him to leave the main road and, after a brief fight, Bond starts to interrogate the driver, who then kills himself with a cyanide-embedded cigarette. During his investigation, Bond sees a picture of a boatman named Quarrel with Strangways. Bond locates Quarrel but finds him to be IN-cooperative when he interviews him. Bond also recognizes Quarrel to have been the driver of the car that chased him from the airport. Bond follows Quarrel and is about to be beaten by him and a friend when the fight is interrupted by the man from the airport who has been following Bond: he reveals himself to be CIA agent Felix Leiter and that not only are the two agents on the same mission, but also that Quarrel is helping Leiter. The CIA has traced the mysterious radio jamming of American rockets to the Jamaica vicinity, but aerial photography cannot see the exact location of its origin. Quarrel reveals to have been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also tells about the island of Crab Key, owned by the reclusive Dr. No, who operates a bauxite mine, which is rigorously protected against trespassers by armed security force and low-scan radar. After finding a receipt in Strangways' house about mysterious rocks naming, Professor R.J. Dent, Bond meets with Dent who says he had assayed the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. This visit makes Dent wary and he takes a boat to Crab Key where Dr. No expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond and orders him to try again, this time with a large venomous spider. Bond survives and after a final attempt on his life, sets a trap for Dent, who he captures, interrogates, and then kills.QUESTIONS: What was detected in Quarrel's boat? Where does Quarrel take Bond? Why did he take Bond there for? What are they looking for? Where does Bond meet Honey Ryder? What was Honey Ryder looking for when Bond found her? Why was Honey afraid of Bond? Who was attacked after nightfall? Why were they attacked after nightfall instead of daylight? What happen to Honey and Bond were attacked? Why would Bond have dinner with Dr. No? Who planned a surprise at the launch? Why was Bond in prison and what happen to Honey? MY THOUGHTS ON THIS PICTURE. This wasn't bad for the first James Bond movie. The Bond movies got better as the years went on. This Bond movie didn't have the toys that you would see in the later Bond films which took some of the action away. Sean Connery wasn't bad in this movie either. He wasn't the greatest James Bond actor either. I think Roger Moore and Pierce Bronson were a lot better. The best part of this movie is when Ursula Andress come walking on the beach in her swimsuit. That to me is when the movie got good. With Ursula as the leading lady in this movie I give this movie 10 weasel stars",Dr. No
210,shepardjessica,4th Best of Sean's 7!,7,8 August 2004,"The original Bond film in '62 is not that complicated, but welll-oiled and polished with ONE of the best Bond gals, Honey Ryder played by the gorgeous Ursula Andress.  Her entrance out of the water with bikini and knife is as beautiful as it can get in an exotic locale with a cool secret agent at the other end.  Sean Connery looked to be in great shape, Joseph Wiseman (a fine actor - check him out in THE DETECTIVE STORY in 1951) is superbly alien, and of course Ms. Andress looks good in bikini or Oriental outfit.This film didn't need the gadgets since it just tried to introduce a character which seemed heroic at the time to 10 year old boys (like me) without really taking itself seriously.  Well-done!",Dr. No

And so it begins. Dr No, the very first ""Bond"" film. The movie that would start the greatest franchise in movie history. Sean Connery (against the wishes of Bond creater Iam Fleming) takes to the screen to give the personification of COOL as the suave superspy. James Bond creater Ian Fleming felt Sean Connery was to young to play ""Bond"" but was made to admit he was wrong. Sean Connery is perfectly cast in the role, giving an assured performance. The movie itself is a taut thriller, this is Bond without the gadgets or the HUGE setpiece's that would go on to define the franchise. Yes maybe by today's standards it seems a little outdated and tame, BUT never forget this is the movie that changed Motion Picture history. Welcome Mr Bond.",Dr. No

Picked this one up first being the first ever Bond film and was sadly disappointed. I think of all the bond films starring Sean Connery in the role I liked Goldfinger the best. This one seemed very very cheesy and felt at the best of times i was watching a Star Trek rerun. I've seen better and it was in my own opinion, a poor poor start to a most excellent franchise. Kudos to the most beautiful Ursula Andress for providing eye candy throughout. Bad kudos to the costume designer, I totally understand the time period this was made in however the radioactive protective suits especially the one wore by Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) I mean cmon! My kids have come up with more creative costumes then these!!!....",Dr. No
213,aura772,The First James Bond Film Adventure!,7,29 September 2007,"I'm rewriting my comment after watching the movie for the second time. My English is also improved due to the semester I spent at the British Council. It makes me laugh how many mistakes I made in my previous comment.So ""Dr. No"" is basically the first James Bond movie. This is the beginning of the industry. Sean Connery is the very first actor who made Bond famous. Or Bond made Connery famous. He makes a very charming Bond and many insist that his was the best portrayal. I think you can't compare one Bond actor to other, they all contributed with their unique way of understanding the character. Connery looks fearless although is morbidly afraid of spiders. It was tricky to film the scene with the tarantula. He also wore a toupee in all the James Bond movies and this started with Dr. No.Sean Connery won the role of James Bond after producer Albert R. Broccoli attended a screening of Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959). He was particularly impressed with the fist fight Connery has with a village bully at the climax of the film. Broccoli later had his wife Dana Broccoli see the film and confirm his sex appeal. Still, for publicity purposes there was a contest to find the perfect man to play James Bond. Six finalists were chosen and screen-tested by Albert R. Broccoli, Harry Saltzman and Ian Fleming. The winner was a 28-year-old model called Peter Anthony who looked the part but completely lacked the acting technique to play it.It's probably unsurprising that one of the most famous sequences in movie history features a woman who spent most of her time faking being an actress. When Swiss bombshell Ursula Andress emerges from the sea in the famed white bikini, she's living proof that what's truly unique about the movies is their unsurpassed visual power. I read that her voice was dubbed in ""Dr. No"" because of her strong accent. I find it amusing. Oh and that white bikini was sold at an Auction in London in 2001. It was worth 40,000 UK pounds.",Dr. No

The ending seemed just a tad rushed but all the loose ends were tied up.Maybe my favorite Bond girl to date. She was stunning and so natural.I wish they could have fleshed out Dr No a little more. They didn't say much about him. He seemed like a pretty cool villain.Sean Connery again is easily my favorite Bond. He was a natural for this role.,Dr. No
216,carologletree,A Good Start to the Most Successful Franchise of All Time,7,6 January 2016,"Here it is, the film that started it all. This was a solid kick-off to the James Bond series.Of course, this film features the original (and best) Bond, Sean Connery. The scene where he was first introduced is classic. He may not be quite as comfortable as he would be in is later Bond movies, but he still did very well in his first movie.Ursula Andress is very attractive and plays Honey Ryder well. If you've never seen or at least heard of the scene where she walks out of the ocean, I'm going to ask you, ""where have you been the last 53 years?"" Joseph Wiseman is great as Dr. No, one of the most classic and one of the best Bond Villains ever. His death is pretty gruesome.Supporting roles include Bernard Lee as M, Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny, and Jack Lord as Felix Leiter. These are characters that remain staples for the series.The plot is intriguing and the locales in the Bahamas are gorgeous. It also has a lot of period charm that gives it a unique feel.The film is slow in some parts, and it doesn't have as much action as some people might be used to with a lot of the subsequent Bond films. While it would be surpassed by many later films in the series, this is nevertheless a historically significant film, and it makes for a pretty good watch even disregarding its significance.RATING: B",Dr. No
217,Ibuk,The one that started it all,7,17 February 2009,"The year was 1962 and the world's longest running movie franchise was kickstarted with this great Bond movie. It provided a formula which future Bond movies were to follow, even to this day. Beautful Women,great action and a super villain. Adapted from the famous Ian Flemming novel of the same name it tells the story of a famous spy who goes to investigate the disappearance of a fellow spy. Sean Connery was perfect as the suave spy James Bond. Ursula Andress was rather good too, in fact being a guy she provided the biggest highlight for me. That famous bikini sequence(later copied in DAD) still does not disappoint, even after 47 years. Joseph Wiseman was great as super villain Dr No. After not having seen it for years, a couple of weeks I watched it again when a TV channel was showing it. After watching it I can safely say it still provides great entertainment and packs a almighty punch. Though not quite as FRWL or even Goldfinger(my personal favourite Bond movie)it is still a pretty good movie and it is fun for fans to sit down and watch the Bond movie franchise in it's prime. Pure escapist fun.",Dr. No
218,matija-trost,THE LEGEND IS BORN...,10,10 April 2004,"Ahhh...let's go back to the year 1962. What was going on than? Well, Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her L.A. home, the Cuba crisis, racial integration in U.S. and yes, the first 007 was released in London. The legend was born.They launch into the orbit until till than fairly unknown actor, and they hit the jackpot. Stalwart, confident, cool under pressure and witty. Sean Connery was all that and more. Beside him, was gorgeous and talented Honey Ryder (26-years old Ursula Andress) as the main ""love bird"" beside Sylvia Trench (Eunice Gayson) and villain Miss Taro (Zena Marshall). And as always trusty allies from Q (this time played by Peter Burton and only appeared for 10 seconds) to CIA and of course M. Thus, we can't forget his Jamaican friends Puss-Feller and Quarrel (a nice play from John Kitzmiller).
On the other hand we have interesting villains in this one. Though we have seen toughest and better opponents in other Bond movies, Dr. No have some class and helpful friends such as ""funny"" three blind assassins and Professor Dent (great scene by the way in the cabin).So, is the first also the best in series? No, but it definitively ranks in top 5 Bond movies ever. It got best Bond actor (Sean Connery), great woman (Ursulla Andres) though we have seen better chemistry, superb jazzy score by Monty Norman with nice Jamaica sounds, witty bond humor (""i think that they were on the way to a funeral"" or ""make sure that he doesn't escape""), dreamy locations (Jamaica) and the component director who made the timeless classic. For this reasons, although not the best in the series, it still deserves a highest possible rate10 out of 10.",Dr. No
219,thedarkhorizon,The origin of Bond and delightful film set architecture of Ken Adam.,7,8 April 2020,"Amazing to see the first Bond film: and yet it is still one of my favorites. Connery created the cult figure by embodying it so well. To each actor his own, but in some ways I think later actors could not live up to the figure Connery created because each has his own special traits, but cannot be 'Connery'.I had fun studying the 'cliche's the film establishes and how things are shot in the early 60s. (night scenes by day, loads of blending images into each other) and hell, the set design by KEN ADAM is still so timeless and genius. One can literally feel the supervillain power of Dr. No in these architectural creations of Ken Adam. Purely a delight to watch.This film is a must see to understand the character of 'Bond' and the film making rules of this franchise. Even after nearly 60 years, this film is somehow timeless and a must see.",Dr. No
220,C22Man,"Bond, James Bond",7,3 July 2015,"Bond Review.Title: A good first title, nicely mysterious and vague in the right way.Pre-Titles: As this is the first film there is understandably no pre-title sequence.Theme Song: No real theme exactly, we get the Bond main theme and when that bursts into life it always gets you excited for what lies ahead. Three Blind Mice is also used and fits in well. Plot: Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the death of a fellow agent named Strangeways. His investigations lead him onto the trail of Dr. No who has been disrupting NASA rocket launches in plans to dominate the West and the East. The plot is close to the megalomaniac wanting world control, but has some smart twists. The film feels much more grounded than later efforts and there is a real sense of mystery to the events unfolding, the audience has to keep guessing along with Bond. The story flows very smoothly and remains engaging throughout, with the mystique of Dr. No built up along the way.James Bond: Sean Connery effortlessly steps into the role as Bond in an incredibly assured debut performance. He balances out the different aspects of the character flawlessly here as he moves from charming to ruthless with complete ease. You really do believe that women would be attracted to him and that he could handle himself in a fight such is the presence that Connery possesses.Bond Girls: The scene of Ursula Andress coming out of the water has become iconic and rightly so. Andress does a fantastic job as Honey Ryder by presenting a tough girl with touches of fragility and plenty of charm. She looks great too, but doesn't fall into the trap of just being a pretty face, and she remains one of the most memorable Bond girls in the series. Villains: Joseph Wiseman takes the title role and despite his lack of screen time he is excellent as the metal-handed scientist. He plays No as cold and reserved, but with a sense of malice that is always close to the surface. He doesn't care about who he harms and has some really good dialogue that gives an insight into the character. He also has a suitably gruesome demise. Dent is a decent henchman as Anthony Dawson has the nervousness and tense look that pays off. He helps to portrayal No as an almost mythical figure and his death shows Bond at his most ruthless.Support: Jack Lord is superb as Leiter. He has a naturally calm presence and you truly believe that he is the American equivalent Bond, it is tragic that he never returned to the series. John Kitzmiller is very good as fisherman Quarrel who aids Bond along the way and you get a real sense that both men are looking out for each other. Bernard Lee is excellent in his first turn as Bond's easily annoyed superior M.Action: The action scenes take are much more grounded and rough here. There are no big set-pieces, but the fights look brutal and have a gritty realism that works very well. We get to see Bond show his strength a few times and the climax is quite low-key yet still intense.Score: John Barry's score is appropriately bombastic when it needs to be and has many parts build up tension which really adds to certain scenes. The main theme is used in many scenes which might be distracting, but it's so good that it is never a bother. There are also a lot of outside songs used which have a Caribbean twist that give uniqueness to the film and are very enjoyable.Production Values: For a start the sets and locations used all look wonderful and present somewhere that is exotic. Having the film set in one major location allows the plot and characters to be developed a lot more which the film takes advantage of. The low-key style transitions perfectly into the cinematography and the film is shot effectively by Terence Young. His directing style isn't very flashy or visually unique, but it keeps things simple and never does something stylish just for the sake of it. Ken Adam's sets are absolutely fantastic given the low budget, there is a sense of scope to Dr. No's lair and an almost futuristic aspect to many of the designs with in it. The costumes are all very well designed to, with Bond's suits look very smart, the famous bikini still holds up and even No's unusual suit looks really effective.Conclusion: Dr. No is pretty much a perfect start for the series and certainly set the bar high for the following instalments. Almost every area of the film has clearly had time spent on it and the result is a Bond film that still holds up. The winning formula was set-up and the films that followed stuck close to it. Connery makes an excellent Bond, Andress does a good job, Dr. No is an interesting first villain, the support is great and so are the visuals. The grounded tone would later be abandoned somewhat, but it is done perfectly here. As far as first films go Dr. No is excellent and was just the start the series needed.",Dr. No
221,morganstephens512,The first,9,19 September 2017,"I thought it was a pretty decent film. Although if I din't know James Bond was a mega franchise, I would have never expected that sort of film to be the start to something this big. I find it odd the credits were only like ten seconds at the end. Sean Connery gave off a pretty good performance, although I guess that is not his best film. The first ten minutes really confused me but after that I sort of started to understand what was happening and I was able to enjoy it after that point. My favorite part of the film was the part when it was showing the spider crawling up his body and he was just laying there is stillness waiting for it to get off him before he reacted. I was also surprised it took 50 minutes for the love interest to show up. I would she would have been in the first twenty minutes. Although I did role my eyes at the black guy dying when nobody else did. Or the villain only being in the last fifteen minutes. Overall, I would say a 8.5/10.

222,Kakueke,Start with the basics,8,13 October 2001,"Dr. No is a good start to the Bond series, and understandably, more straightforward and tightly edited, less pompous.  We don't get too much of the eponymous villain, who is seen only toward the end, and relatively briefly--I can understand building the tension before introducing the villain, but I thought there could have been more character development and interaction with Bond.  For on the basics, he is one of the most interesting Bond villains to me.  Ursula Andress is truly one of the most gorgeous Bond (and any) women, and we begin to get the tone of the series when she asks Bond, ""Do you have a woman of your own""? Sean Connery is perhaps at his peak physical appearance, muscular and seeming literally to be without an ounce of fat, and his first fight scene is formidable as he completely dominates (in later movies, this would often not be the case--he just wins).  One reason I like this movie, sort of getting back to my first sentence, is that Bond is a regular guy, the protagonist of the film, but not, you know, James Bond, so we can enjoy the story for itself and not already be sick of the overdone stuff, in the screenplay and in Bond's persona, much of which also is the same old stuff.",Dr. No
223,bushtony,One of the most influential films in the history of cinema,10,22 March 2011,"Easy to forget these days, but modern action cinema was reinvented - perhaps even created - by the first James Bond film Dr No.Keith Richards, when discussing the evolution of modern rock music, once said of Chuck Berry ""before him, there was nothing."" It's an observation that can be debated, but in real terms I feel much the same way about Dr No and it's place in the evolution of action cinema. Before Dr No there was nothing really quite like it. After Dr No, there was plenty that aspired to being.Yes, the roots of this film are traceable back to Hitchcock (North By Northwest), Bulldog Drummond, Sax Rohmer, Buchan, Household, etc. But the way in which DrNo was choreographed, filmed, framed, scripted, directed, acted, completely revolutionised the action movie. To this very day, it continues to influence filmmaking and filmmakers in the same way that Hitchcock does.Many would cite Goldfinger as the blueprint for the Bond formula which has sustained and flourished for so many years. And I would agree with that in terms of creative fine-tuning and stylistic definition. However from the moment Sean Connery is first glimpsed sat at the gaming table, wreathed in cigarette smoke, sardonic, confident, radiating a combination of masculine sexuality and heroic poise, a different kind of iconic movie protagonist was born along with a different kind of movie. In fact, here we have the fledgling beginnings of the cinematic ""anti-hero."" The spectrum was expanded for the development of an alternative type of lead character in mainstream films. Witness the clinical execution of Professor Dent and consider how this most likely would have been handled in major motion pictures prior to Dr No. This was daring, groundbreaking stuff, re-writing the rules.Still, all this would mean little if the film hadn't been any good. But it was, and still is, one of the best action/adventure movies ever made. And, in the context of what came after it, one of the most satisfying and influential films in the history of modern cinema.",Dr. No

All the sexual innuendo's are in place as are some of the nice stunts setting the stage for later adventures of Bond.While Dr. No isn't a high point for the series, it is a very entertaining movie with a great bad guy and, of course, a great Bond girl in the form of Ursula Andress.",Dr. No

It is a well-made moovie, but it does suffer from a decided lack of budgeting that future Bond offerings will have aplenty - for example, the ""dragon"" is hardly cowvincing, and it's difficult to believe even that the ""island people"" can't see it for what it is. Connery is smooth and likeable, creating a Bond that all others will be hard-put to top.  Wiseman is great as the first Dr. Evil in the Bond universe, and Ursula Andress made moovie history with her ""Venus rising"" scene, which still packs a punch by today's standards.

There, he finds himself in a sea of backstabbing, conspiracies, fun music numbers and unexpected allies - as he teams up with a colourful group of characters; the beautiful Honey Ryder, the fellow agent Felix Leiter and the native guide Quarrel. Their banter inbetween are fun to watch and gives the film a bit of an emotional connection.And whilst the action-scenes, which of course are to be mentioned in a film like this, are great - it is the characters that acts as the heart of the film. Sean Connery in particular is incredibly charismatic in his role as a cocky and smooth-talking British hero, being given one of the most memorable character-introductions seen on film. The titular antagonist, Dr. No, must also be mentioned - he's a great villain to put it simple, sophisticated yet threatening - again, elevated by the great actor playing him.The movie is fastly paced, has lots of well-cut action scenes and has an overall very fun feeling, clearly an inspiration for later movies of the same kind, such as Indiana Jones or Star Wars.It is not a perfect movie, certainly not a deep or overly character-focused piece - but it is a fun experience, not to be missed!",Dr. No

By watching this you should see that the Bond series started out like any other series and that is not knowing where it was going. This film is somewhat cheaply shot and layered but that is to be expected from a film that has little money invested in it as this one does. Made for under a million dollars in 1962 this film could almost be classified as a independent feature that everyone involved with it to mega success. I will say that I love it and find it to be one of Sean's best Bond films, second only to Goldfinger. Look for in this film the first mention of Spectre and it's infamous plots. Also it is because of the end of this film that Bond falls on his greatest enemy ever's hit list. (Ernst Bloefield) But really you should watch this film that is an early action hit.

(I'm not kidding!) But, with that aside - This film certainly contained lots and lots of major let-downs! Such as - The bikini-clad Ursula Andress (aka. Honey Ryder) emerging out of the sea. I'm sorry, folks, but this was not... I repeat, ""THIS WAS NOT"" one of the supposedly sexiest moments ever recorded in the history of film. No, it wasn't.In fact, I thought that this seashell-collecting bimbo, with her tiresome angry pout, put in one of the worst ""Bond-girl"" performances that I've ever seen.And, how about mad scientist, Dr. No, himself? Boy, I'm tellin' ya - This pompous, effeminate, little snot (though a gracious host) made my skin crawl with his insipid presence and his rubber-gloved hands. To me, Dr. No's character was about as menacing as a wet dishrag with his drab and dreary little ""evil"" plot of absolute domination of the world. (Spare me!) Instead of offering the viewer death-defying excitement, mixed generously with a stylish pizazz - Dr. No's humdrum story just sort of drifted along aimlessly from scene to scene without much drive or momentum..... Anyway - What more can I say?",Dr. No

The whole film is very stylish and cool, unlike many Bond movies after ""Goldfinger"". The Jamaican locations are extremely beautiful, Sean Connery is top-notch, and Joseph Wiseman makes a great Dr. No. Acting talents are not Ursula Andress' strongest point, but she has got other more obvious merits. In my book, ""Dr. No"" ranks among the 5 best Bonds.",Dr. No
232,gcrokus,As Important To The Spy Genre As Metropolis Is To Science Fiction,8,3 May 2009,"""Dr. No"" is without question the finest Ian Fleming novel put on film. No only was the James Bond brand established but the machinations of nearly every spy movie since has drawn on ""Dr. No"" for what has come to be a standard plot outline; besides all this Sean Connery became established as a star.If you read early Fleming you will find he originally cast Bond in thoroughly believable stories. His attention to detail, the play of other characters against him and exotic and varied locations made him a hit before the movie was even considered. Fleming himself is an interesting character; his early life in the military and particularly intelligence gave him ample opportunity to invent James Bond.The movie begins with the assassination of an intelligence officer and his secretary; a file is taken from his office, labeled Dr. No. James Bond (Sean Connery) is dispatched to Jamaica to find out what led to the deaths. From the moment he arrives he is plunged into intrigue; his car is tailed, and almost as quickly bedded by a beautiful but questionably-motived woman. Clad nearly always in tailored suits, sipping his martinis and giving off the air of a man intensely confident in his ability, a new screen persona (type) is invented right before our eyes.As Bond's probing unearths more questions than answers, the common thread leads him to put together a clandestine late-night visit to Dr. No's mysterious Crab Key with the colorful Quarrel as guide. After a few hours sleep, a stunning figure emerges from the surf; Honey Ryder's entrance has never been equaled by any woman in any subsequent Bond flick.Bond, Ryder and Quarrel evade the private patrols for a while, but eventually their luck turns bad and they are captured by Dr. No's henchmen. From the time they in the hands of the island police the adventure takes a decidedly high-tech turn. The effects are a little dated in this, our new digital age, but don't seriously detract from the film.The rest of the story is pure Fleming. As he wrote more over the years his plots got less believable and Bond himself became something of a stuntman whose missions were set in a technologically advanced society. I cannot stress enough how this The use of Jamaica as a setting is a master stroke; there are dazzling shots that convey the beauty of the island. There are a couple of spots that you would love to find on your own.Three and a half stars.",Dr. No
233,susansweb,Bond - pre-gadgets; more of a spy story.,9,21 January 2003,"I love the James Bond films but let's face it, about the time of ""Goldfinger"" the Bond movies started to lose much of their credibility.  The first, ""Dr. No"" was more a spy movie; no outlandish gadgets (even the special package Bond receives from England is just a Geiger counter) or outrageous action sequences.  The movie is much like the book and the changes that were made from the book were for the better (the torture maze and Dr. No's original demise wouldn't have translated well to the screen).  What we have is a mysterious disappearance and Bond is sent to investigate. There are double crosses, double agents, one car chase (how do tires screech on a dirt road?) and Bond dispatching the bad guys.  Sean Connery was made for the role and Ursula Andress gives easily her best performance ever.  Joseph Wiseman is malevolent as Dr. No and even Jack Lord's Felix Leiter is one of the more memorable Felixes.  If you are looking for a slam bang action picture like the later Bond movies avoid this one but if you like your spy movies without all of the explosions and crazy stunts, then this is one to see.",Dr. No
234,rjsf96,A Solid Start that Builds the Foundations for the Franchise,9,30 September 2015,"'Dr. No' is without a doubt the Bond film that feels least like a Bond film. It takes place almost solely in Jamaica, there are rarely any double entendres, no gadgets, no opening theme song and the villain does not have a ludicrous plot to control the world by.When secret agent Strangways is mysteriously murdered, English Secret Service Agent James Bond discovers a plot to blow up an American space program. His findings lead him to Jamaica where he comes face to face with the elusive Dr. No, a member of the villainous SPECTRE syndicate.The first thing you will probably notice in comparison to the most recent entries is the style of the action scenes. You can clearly tell when a punch has not been thrown. This does not affect the film, but plays into its camp factor. You do have to remember that for 1962 this was an ambitious project.Sean Connery is so well suited to the role of James Bond that at first glance it looks like he has been in the role for a lifetime. His chemistry with Ursula Andress who plays Honey Ryder comes across as genuine, and not helped by the fact that Andress couldn't speak a word of English (her lines were dubbed over in post-production).'Dr. No' is far from perfect. You get the sense that the film makers were testing the water with the first instalment, seeing how audiences would react to it. There are stretches where it takes time for the plot to get moving; once Bond is in Jamaica though the film picks up the pace. The most interesting sequence is the discussion with Dr. No (a quietly aggressive Joseph Wiseman). Hearing his viewpoints on the world is in nice contrast with the other Bond villains and their conquests for global domination.'Dr. No' is indeed the most down to earth of the franchise. Your enjoyment will depend on how you like your Bond; realistic or outrageous. I myself prefer the latter. But as a first Bond film it is interesting to see it come together and is at the very least a worthwhile film. (Notice how Bond dispatches the villain ever so quickly at the end, in the later instalments it takes him far longer).'Dr. No' is a milestone in cinema. Not because it is the perfect Bond film, but because it saw the English Secret Service Agent see the light of day on celluloid. Its plot is more realistic and simplistic, but the setting of Jamaica is gorgeous, Connery perfect as Bond and we hear the theme tune for the very first time. It ushered in a wave of sequels, many of which surpassed the original in quality. If 'From Russia with Love' and 'Goldfinger' could only be made after 'Dr. No', I would still be glad that this instalment saw the light of day.",Dr. No

Sean Connery is as smooth as anything. Great wit.
Honey Ryder. Jheeeezee. Even 58 years later I can appreciate her. The beach scene and the decontamination scene must have been so riské at the time.Introduces gun in titles, martini's shaken not stirred and the music (which was really well added into certain select moments of the film) which are now iconic.Great first one and can't wait for the rest.",Dr. No
236,jwpeel-1,The beginning of greatness,9,1 December 2006,"It's hard to believe but Sean Connery was anything but the right actor to play the role of Bond so far as its creator was concerned. Connery was a relative unknown at the time, but this film made him a true international superstar much to the chagrin of Ian Fleming. However, Fleming came to be a great friend to the new 007 in a very short time and came to feel that the producers had picked the right man for the job indeed.There were changes from the original book to be sure, but substituting radioactive materials for rare bird dung (guano) was probably a good choice. There is danger and a great villain who, thankfully, was not an orangutan as Fleming friend Noel Coward suggested. It may have been because the Bond author asked Coward in a telegram to play the villain of the piece Dr. No, to which he reportedly answered, ""My dearest Ian. No No No No No!"" This film shows a rough Mickey Spillane type super spy as the author envisioned and then some. And the delicious Ursula Andress among the equally delicious scenery of Jamaica makes it a treat regardless of the obvious dating. So many rough and tumble scenes that make it an adventure along with the pretty women and the introduction of a character that remains to this day as one of the most popular in film history. (I'm not even going to talk about the latest Bond opus as I think this time the producers did indeed choose the wrong guy for the goods.) And 007 went on to become fully fleshed out in most of the Connery offerings before the stage was set for the more lightweight (and I'm being charitable here) forays of the Roger Moore years.",Dr. No

238,simonrosenbaum,Doctor too-little,6,10 December 2002,"It's a lot more straightforward and believable than the later films but it's also slower and not as exciting. Connery looks comfortable in the part right from the start, and quite believable as a spy capable of killing. Ursula Andress is delightful and gives the film a welcome lift. As this is where it all started, it has to be seen in the right context. For a 40+ year old film it holds up reasonably well but obviously can't compare with some of today's action films. Maybe not the best in the series but it does have a lot of charm, which slowly disappeared as the series became more successful. (6/10)",Dr. No
239,yarborough,"The first and, yes, the best.",9,30 October 2001,"Personally, I don't think the James Bond movies are the best things to come out of the motion picture industry, but I have seen them all and ""Dr. No"" is the best, for many reasons. First, ""Dr. No"" perfectly captures what Ian Fleming wanted the novels to be: spy stories that are a little more twisted than reality. Second, Bond is supposed to rely on his wits to escape dangerous situations and ""Dr. No"" is the only entry in the series that shows that. The gadgets and gimmicks of later entries undermine Bond's physical capabilities and make anything seem possible, destroying all the tension in the movies. ""Dr. No"" is the only flick in which Bond appears to be a hard-edged, quick witted spy and his nemesis is the only truly intimidating villain Bond ever faced (Goldfinger looks like the Pillsbury Dough boy). This Bond flick also has the best Felix Leiter (Jack Lord), who clearly outshines Bond in manliness. The story is very easy to follow (not the convoluted mess of other entries) and it thankfully doesn't have the cartoonish action of later Bond films. The action here is more realistic and intense. Although I can't stand Ursula Andress in this movie, she is one of the deepest, most believable Bond girls of all. The settings here are also the most marvelous-looking of all the Bond films. This is a generally enjoyable Bond movie that the later movies should have followed, but, unfortunately, didn't.",Dr. No

The movie doesn't boast of an exemplary plot, but it somehow manages to make the viewers feel satisfied from watching a detective classic, a genre that has The Maltese Falcon at the forefront.The movie is made in color, which further adds to its technical achievements.Perhaps David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is still one of the greatest movies made in color, a movie that established Peter O'Toole as an actor.

Frankly, it appears that Sean Connery fits into the frame right away: good looking and capable, but capable of what?When the crisis arises the master-gambler gets pulled out from the table to play for much bigger stakes than money while still enjoying favorite shaken not stirred martini with vodka. Thinking of all the agents you will expect tons of gadgets to be displayed in the hands of the British intelligence, however, this time we get to see the full potential of a bare-handed womanizer using his knowledge learned in the improvisation class.Don't get disappointed as the tricks of the firm are still simple but exquisite, the skills walk the razors edge revealing the impeccable level of training. The scenes are filled with solid stunts, although many moments lack realism. Despite this, I admire the way that the iconic Bond character is presented: he is not an invincible terminator, and every mistake that he ever makes is presumed to be on purpose.The villain in the picture supposed to be smart, but in fact does not even make you flinch. The evil plan gives you a smile and relaxes you even more, allowing to kick back the seat and just enjoy the spectacle. Let's hope that all the reveals will lead us to the tangled adventure for James Bond.Returning to the headquarters I would report that the mission of deploying the new secret agent into the world of cinema has been successful, count me in as a new fan of James Bond that eagerly waits for the sequel.",Dr. No

Luckily, it was a box office hit - and watching it now is a lot of fun. Just don't expect Goldfinger or Skyfall. This is also one of the most playful Bond movies - as if the filmmakers were trying to decide whether to play it straight, or go for goofiness that the original David Niven as Bond ""Casino Royale"" would go for. Connery seems to be having a great time, too.....his enthusiasm would decline with each subsequent film. Dr. No himself was the original Blofeld, bent on some sort of world domination (a recurring motif of the villains in most Bond movies).

245,eamon-hennedy,No film does it better.,10,24 March 2004,"The first Bond film has a lot and, in certain regards, nothing in common with the following nineteen Bond films. Many of the trademarks are set in stone with Dr No. The casino scenes, the willing women ready to make love to Bond, the Bond girl, in this case the beautiful Urusula Andress in a bikini no less, a power crazy villain, the scene with M and the flirtations with Moneypenny. Yet there is a lot here that is missing that other Bond films would create for themselves, such as the over reliance in gadgets, the visit with Q (who wouldn't make his first appearance until From Russia With Love) and the over elaborate action sequences, instead we get here is Bond breaking into Dr No's laboratory and destroying it before killing No himself. Yet we do get a lot here than later films would have. The villain is crazy and suffer from talking killer syndrome, in this case to the extreme. He wines and dines with Bond instead of just killing him, instead just giving Bond a beating, letting him live to escape at the film's end, but we do get some of the puns that would be pushed to the limit in later films and in some cases they're quite funny here (the funeral line is a classic).The film is brilliant however. As the start of the first major film franchise, James Bond could not have dreamt of a dream start. The plot is quite enthralling, the villain interesting and Connery oozes pure class as Bond. While I think Brosnan has eclipsed him, you can see how for years many thought he was the best. He is so charming (just check him out in the casino scene and his flirtations with Moneypenny, the way he dances with her while the sit is wonderful), yet can be so cold blooded, such as when he kills Professor Dent, which has an element of viciousness that wouldn't be returned too thoroughly until For Your Eyes Only and Licence to Kill.All the elements gel together wonderfully and it is no surprise it was the start of an enduring and popular series.",Dr. No

Connery as Bond rules! Enjoy them all.While the Connery Bond films have aged so well, the same cannot be said for Roger Moore's Bond films. I think a lot of it has to do with the former ""Saint"" insistence on so much naughty schoolboy humor.

247,I_should_be_reading_a_book,The birth of a cinematic icon.,9,25 September 2018,"I got to see this movie as a teen in it's debut year, 1962. At the time, my father was already a Ian Fleming avid reader and, even tho I hadn't read any of the books in his ample English language library (my command of the language was quite poor then), I was familiar with the character name, so when it hit the theaters I just had to see it . Even tho the film was rated 18+ in Mexico my High School buddies and me managed to smuggle in and we were instantly hooked. Later in College, I binged through the books at the expense of my grades, LOL!.About this film, suffice to say that it set the pattern for all the rest of Bond and bondish films. For starters, it's hard to evaluate James Bond without bringing Sean Connery to mind; there's simply no one who has defined him like Connery did.Without fantastic cars and gadgetry, the movie Bond drove a beautiful car, dressed impeccably (have you ever seen a Tuxedo or suits like the ones Bond wears, even in the Jamaican heat?), fought decently without pretending to be Superman and was able to shoot a 7,65mm PPK at 40 meters accurately. The guy set the style that all young adults tried to imitate in the years to come, not the clownish Austin Powers mod character, the bookish Harry Palmer of Michael Cayne nor the somber Alec Leamas portrayed by Richard Burton in Le Carre's Spy Who Came In From The Cold. A real man had to be at the same time a dapper gentleman and an unpredictable but resourceful rogue. No self respecting spy would ever need a 1911 .45 Colt nor a 9mm Browning High Power. The puny 7,65 PPK (not even the .380/9mm Kurz version) should suffice. If it was good enough for Her Majesty's Secret Service, it was certainly good enough for Bond!For young folks who are just being introduced to the genre by Daniel Craig (a very decent Bond, BTW) the first three Connery Bond films are a must. They will reveal to them the real essence of the character, from there they can follow the saga with some pathetic interpretations and -possibly- some not so bad ones.For old geezers like me, who grew up in the sixties and were youn adults in the sixties, Dr. No is a fresh breeze with tropical aromas from the past.",Dr. No
248,CalDexter,The perfect Introduction of the James Bond universe.,10,26 May 2007,"Although Doctor No is almost a half century old, it still stands as an excellent 'First' film into the world of 007.The opening gun barrel sequence starts not with the customary Bond soundtrack (as in later films) but a series of strange and eerie electronic sounds, with the theme kicking in after the gunshot is fired.This distinguishes this opening sequence from the other films to follow as the first 'Offical' James Bond Film. There is no title song by a famous artist (except Underneath The Mango Tree, which is played later in the film) only the James Bond theme which kicks in perfectly when we first see Sean Connery 'Bond...James Bond.' at the Casino, when he arrives at the airport in Jamaica, and when hes been chased by a gang of killers in a black hearse ('I think they were on their way to a funeral!'). Special mention must go to Sean Connery for an excellent performance as James Bond. From his first scene he strolls through the role as if hes always been that character. Never once in any scene does he lack confidence or authority - even when hes getting a beating off of Doctor No's security guards. Connery is tough, gritty, charming, intelligent and sophisticated - everything James Bond's character should be. The supporting cast are excellent too. Joseph Wiseman is memorable as Doctor No in the Bond universe the way Darth Vader lingers in the mind after seeing A New Hope for the very first time. Why Jack Lord never reprised his role for Goldfinger and Thunderball always bothered me. Hes perfect as Felix Leiter. What annoyed me about the Bond film producers was their approach to casting an abundance of actors in the one role such as Leiter or Blofeld over a period of different films.Ursula Andress is gorgeous in this film, especially in the sequence where she slowly emerges from the surf, a famous cinema sequence that still looks good today.The plot is more of a pedestrian detective adventure set in Kingston Jamaica, with Bond sent to investigate the disappearance of Agent Strangways and the 'Toppling' of American rockets in space, but there is still some great action and suspense in Bond's encounter with a Tarantula in his bed and a laughable back screen projection car chase (but its still brilliant OK?) intermixed with scenic photography and Production Designer Ken Adam's Nuclear Laboratory which is a fantastic explosive climax to an excellent first film.",Dr. No

In most cases, the books are better than the films, and the stories in the films were better back when they were truer to the books. It was a long time however before I saw a portrayal of James Bond that I could recognise as Bond from the books and one with which I was satisfied. That is one of the problems with Dr. No, I just don't see Sean Connery as my Bond. He is good, but after reading the books he just isn't Bond. The film is a little slow, but if you're prepared to forgive, as it was made in the early 60s don't forget, it is a story that can be enjoyed.

256,TimBoHannon,"Great Film Making, Short on Interest and Excitement",5,7 February 2012,"The consensus in the scientific community seems to be that non-verbal elements make up 55% of what we communicate. That is what I first noticed watching Sean Connery play James Bond. Bond is a powerful and cunning man, and Connery communicates that to the audience simply by moving. When he makes the bed, we see a man of focus and purpose in the way he pulls off the bed sheet and casts it aside. He tells the viewers that he is in charge just by how he walks. When he discerns that somebody is trying to trick him, all he needs to do is stare ahead and we know that somebody is in big trouble. Watching Sean's performance in ""Dr. No"" from an analytical perspective is fun. Sadly, the movie does not have enough interest or excitement to match either his performance or its other strengths.Terence Young directs ""Dr. No"" and scores a triumph in film-making. The cinematography, acting, set design, creativity, and atmosphere are all laudable. The screenplay is intelligent, the story is linear, and the action scenes are uniformly competent. Young photographs Ken Adam's soon-to-be legendary sets with a great sense of scope and a thorough lens. I even have enough information to imagine the geography of the small island Bond visits because the camera and the characters gave me enough information to do so. There is not a weak performance to be found. That is what I call a triumph of directing.James Bond's first screen mission is uncomplicated. Unknown assassins murder a member of Great Britain's foreign intelligence shortly after he starts gathering information for the CIA. James Bond of the 00 division is assigned to find out what he uncovered. The CIA's Felix Leiter (Jack Lord), Bond, and their local contacts quickly suspect a man known as Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman). No, however, is a resourceful foe not to be taken lightly.Besides Connery, Wiseman gives the other standout performance. The script builds up to his appearance through numerous conversations between other characters. Wiseman must match the impressive image the audience has of his character prior to meeting him. Wiseman plays No as a polite, articulate man whose self-control reaches the point of becoming a weapon of fear. Insults and disrespect do not even affect him. No may be the most intelligent villain in the series; he can even design a nuclear power plant. His one conversation with Bond is the highlight of the movie.As good as all of that sounds, I have never been able to embrace the movie as much as I want. The movie simply does not have enough to remain interesting for its entire length. Ursula Andress plays a gorgeous Bond- girl, Bond's sidekick (John Kitzmiller) is good even though a couple of moments seem to stereotype him and make me uncomfortable. The script is well-written, but none of these elements overcome the fact that the movie is too uninteresting. No matter how many times I watch it, I always find myself looking at the clock or the time-index on my DVD player. This happens both before and after Dr. No has been introduced. I can expound on ""Dr. No's"" virtues all day long, but the movie ends up in boredom. Even the climax is underwhelming. Far inferior movies are more enjoyable because there is enough meat to the story to engross its viewer for its entire running time.In summary, ""Dr. No"" does not earn more than five out of ten stars. The ingredients were there, and they would be used again in the powerhouse second chapter of the Bond series. It is fortunate that it took less to excite a movie audience back then, because an action movie of such a plodding pace would not be allowed a sequel today. The franchise may have started slowly, but many great Bond movies were yet to come. If I watched ""Dr. No"" before the others, I would have predicted that.",Dr. No
257,Ansango,Simple yet superb,7,22 October 2015,"The first movie of James bond cannon... What a start!The movie is very good in terms of visuals,acting,cinematography and musical score.The plot might be a little feeble but its execution is quite good.The film maintains its pace nicely.The runtime is also OK.The climax is a little doddering.The plot also contains some minor flaws but they are quickly overcome by its fast pace and the amazing storytelling ability of Terence Young. Sean looks amazing.He must have been a heartthrob during his age.His charismatic look and flamboyant personality mixed with his amazing panache is impeccable.He is a perfect choice for the role and no one other than him could have played this act so admirably.Ursula never looked so attractive.Joseph Wiseman's role was a little puny.I expected him to be more stronger.Yet him calm and wise voice was fit for his role of a evil genius. Cinematogrphy is awesome.The camera captures the vibrant and picturesque surrounding brilliantly.The visuals are good.The light hearted tone and good one liners are another positive points for the film. A nice movie and a must watch for the Bond lovers.The start of this brilliant Spy saga is not to be missed. 6.8 out of 10 is my final rating.",Dr. No
258,treeskier802,The First Film of Movie's Most Prominent Franchise Is One of it's Best,10,15 May 2007,"Who would have known in 1962, with James Bond's first adventure in Dr. No that it would become the most prolific franchise in film history? At the time of this post, Bond has been with us for 45 years, and even though there are many excellent films in the franchise (all of which are entertaining), Dr. No remains one of the best.Dr. No sets the mood and tone for the entire series. From the opening scene where the 3 blind mice murder a British Agent to the finale in the evil Dr. No's underground laboratory, the audience is taken on a ride of thrilling espionage, beautiful women, and exotic locales.This film, however, is not simply a classic among Bond films, it is a classic among films in general. When the camera shows us the back of a man sitting at a casino table and then dramatically shows Sean Connery as he introduces himself as Bond (draws lighter to cigarette), James Bond, a movie icon is born.Likewise, when Ursula Andress appears on the beach clad in her sexy bikini, the world is introduced to the first of many exotic Bond girls. Of course, this happens on the beaches of exotic Jamaica, which is one of the most beautiful locations in all the Bond films.Dr. No has a gritty edge to it that some of the other Bond movies moved away from in the 1970s. This is one of the only films where Bond kills a man who is out of options and who really cannot fight back. The story, for the most part, is also fairly believable and realistic; the humor being slight tongue-in-cheek, versus the hokey humor in some of the later films starring Moore and Brosnan.This film is worth a watch just for the cinematography. It is a classic that still stands up to today's film standards. The story is engaging, the characters are interesting and the location is gorgeous. Rating 10 of 10 stars.",Dr. No
259,MovieJunkie1976,You have to start somewhere...,6,15 December 2014,"***Warning!

260,Theflyace,"Bond Month #1: Good first outing, not overly great",6,26 September 2013,"Dr. No, the first ever film of the Bond series. It has not aged very well, but that doesn't mean its awful. It established Sean Connery as the best Bond actor and kicked off some things that would become formula for the next 50 years. But other things in the film haven't gone over too well and seem very dated.The story entails MI6 agent James Bond 007(Sean Connery) trying to stop a mad scientist (SPECTER agent Dr. No) from destroying the U.S. rocket program in Jamaica. Along the way he picks up the headstrong and sexy Honey Ryder (played by the gorgeous Ursula Andress) and the two discover Dr. No's evil lair. We don't even see Dr. No to the very end so even though he is suitably creepy, he's not very much a threat as he is a nuisance to Bond. Bond is able to dispose of Dr. No and the rocket is saved.The reason why I don't like this movie as much as some of the others is that it feels pretty ragged and not overly interesting. The story is all over the place and doesn't hold much focus until the end. Most of it feels like filler, with no real tight plot or structure. Just as the book Dr. No by Ian Fleming wasn't all that interesting to begin with for me. The filmmakers tried some new filming and editing styles to counter it. It works, but only slightly.Now with that said let's get down to the best element of this movie, Sean Connery's performance. He established James Bond as one of the greatest heroes of any medium, as well as revealing Connery as the best actor to play Bond. He's cool, he collected, he's a brute, he's suave with the ladies. He was the manliest man ever created. And it leads to one of the, if not the number one, greatest scenes in cinema history. Just Bond playing poker, lighting a cigarette and introducing himself to a lovely lady as ""Bond, James Bond."" Honey Ryder is also pretty good in this movie, mostly because of how she's introduced and how she looks. Most of the Bond girls are simply put in there as fodder for him and have no personality really. Honey is one of the exceptions, she is strong, but she still very much is an innocent. But we have to talk about her intro. It's simply filmed and approached, but its still amazing. She looks gorgeous in the white bikini and set the standard for the Bond girls to follow.And we also have the score. Its a strange score except for one thing, as everybody knows, the ever awesome ""James Bond theme."" John Barry helped to give the theme its rock/percussive elements which has endeared since it was first heard in 1962. Just like Bond himself, the theme is cool, its sexy, it rocks, and pumps the viewer up for exciting action. Even though there's no exciting action in this film the theme became inseparable from Bond. The rest of the score is unbelievably flat and dated, but the theme is absolutely incredible. So on the whole, its good, but I don't see it as one of the better Bonds. Some things are very hokey and not very cutting edge nowadays. But with that said, it was good enough to get the series going, so I recognize it's value as a Bond film and in movies in general. Its at lest watchable, unlike some of the ones that came later. Dr. No has its unbelievably good moments, so it helps. 007, welcome to cinema.",Dr. No

Sean Connery, in the role that makes him a star does a fantastic job in his portrayal of the calm, cool and collected 007.

262,FilmFreak94,Good Ol' Fashioned Spy Thriller Fun,9,23 October 2012,"Being the first James Bond film, Dr. No has several aspects that are dated or cliché in comparison to the other movies. But ignoring all that it is still a fun experience and a good introduction to 007. After a fellow agent is killed, British Intelligence agency MI6, sends one of its top agents, James Bond to investigate his disappearance. Upon landing he is immediately tailed by two men and avoids being photographed by a mysterious journalist. With help from the Jamaican government he learns that the CIA were involved with the fallen agent and they too are searching for clues on his disappearance. With help from a native boatman named Quarrel, Bond learns that a man named Dr. No might be involved with the disappearance and tries to gather information on him. But James is being hounded by several of No's henchmen and each try to kill him before he learns too much. It doesn't stop Bond from investigating No's island, Crab Key, where he meets the beautiful Honey Ryder. But Dr. No is not a man to be trifled with as Bond learns of a higher source of power than even the Soviet Union. Bond has to stop Dr. No's plans and save the girl while he's at it.This film is a great introduction to the classic 007 character and the rest of the film series. Sean Connery is the ideal Bond, mixing morbid one liners and a charming disposition. Of course his constant womanizing might be off-putting to some but his charm might make up for it. Might.The rest of the cast provide excellent performances even for those characters that are killed off or only show up once. Dr. No himself is a good start of the Bond Villain list but his character left me wanting a little more. He only showed up for a few scenes and is killed off in a semi-unspectacular fashion, at least to me. But Joseph Wiseman's performance is a perfect fit to the character.The film isn't perfect but it's a fun film to start off the series and worth the rental or buy.",Dr. No
263,sanddragon939,'007 is here sir',9,25 May 2009,"Before the Aston Martins and the jetpacks. Before the explosive violence and the world domination plots. Before Bond went underwater, or into outer space. Before the invisible cars and laser-powered wristwatches. Before the campiness and humour of Roger Moore and the sheer physical intensity of Daniel Craig. There was only a Scottish actor named Sean Connery, and a film called 'Dr. No' which served as the introduction to the fictional spy whose cinematic escapades would go on to become the stuff of legend! 'Bond, James Bond'- the suave and sophisticated secret agent introduces himself, for the first time in the history of cinema...and the journey into a glamorous and romanticized world of espionage and international intrigue begins.Dr. No is certainly in no way a match for many of the future installments in the Bond franchise, chief among them being such masterpieces as From Russia with Love, Thunderball or Casino Royale. And yet, it's importance in the history of the Bond canon and in Western cinema itself can never be undermined. Thats not to say its not a good film in its own right-its a pretty good film with a good plot line (courtesy of Ian Flemming's bestselling novel). Dr. No in many ways is a prototype of the classic 'Bond formula' setting the stage for the elements that would grace many a future Bond adventure-exotic locations, beautiful women, glamour, action (at a bare minimum, however), glamour, intrigue, and an interesting and menacing villain headquartered in an elaborately constructed lair. The trademark pre-title sequence, theme song, fancy gadgets etc. however are yet to make their mark.Sean Connery does a pretty good job in his debut as James Bond, agent 007 of the Secret Service. Connery plays Bond the way Flemming originally envisioned him as in his books, as a cold, calculating and emotionally detached agent who carries out his tasks with machine-like precision and kills in cold blood without the slightest hesitation, if the mission demands it. Thats not to say his Bond is totally inhuman, on the contrary we do see a more human side to Bond as well. He is clearly a man with likes and dislikes. We learn that he enjoys gambling, cigarettes, drinks and above all, women! We can see the fear on his face when he is nearly bitten by a venomous spider, disgust and regret on his face when his ally Quarell is killed, satisfaction on surviving the events of the film in the arms of the beautiful Honey Ryder (played by Ursula Andress, who, unlike many future Bond girls, adds nothing to the plot here besides a pretty face and a 'love interest' to Bond). He is a cold professional on the job but he is also an ordinary man; important distinctions which are oft overlooked in later films. Connery would go on to add more personality and bring more charisma to the role in subsequent films. Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell do well in their debuts as series regulars M and Miss Moneypenny respectively, though there is nothing particularly outstanding about their parts. Jack Lord does okay as Bonds American counterpart, Felix Leiter. Joseph Wiseman's brief appearance as the film's titular villain Dr. No, towards the end, clearly set the standards for many a future Bond villain in terms of personality and style of operation.In terms of action, there isn't much to look out for save a nice car chase somewhere in the middle and some explosions in the end...but then again, this is only the beginning, isn't it. Ultimately, even if you don't rank this one as the best, its still the seed which led to bigger and better things, and it deserves credit as such",Dr. No
264,simplysoda_19f,"Connery is the one, the only Bond, James Bond",9,17 July 2006,"I got to tell you, when I first saw the James Bond series when I was a kid, I thought it was pretty cool. I loved it because there were tons of action scenes, it had a great theme and of course it had a handsome man playing the hero. If I remember correctly there have been 5 handsome men playing Bond, but nobody comes close to Sean Connery. I got to tell you, he was the best Bond, maybe it's because he was the first one, another thing I love about him, besides his looks, is his sexy accent. He did an awesome job as Bond, he portrayed a spy exactly the way one should be played, he was cool, keen and mysterious.Dr. No was the first movie in the series, and yes it was one of the best, particularly because of the timing, it wasn't too long and it wasn't too short, just perfect. It had a lot of great fight scenes and yes of course there's guns going off every 5 mins, or maybe less. So it's a great movie for the action fan genre. It's also got a few tender moments between Bond and his lady friend. Yes, it's got an evil villain, who doesn't appear until the second half of the movie which is good, cause you're trying to guess what he looks like, basically who is Dr. No.I gave this movie 9 out of 10, because yes it had a good story line, tons of action, a great hero, an evil villain, a lady in distress, it wasn't too long, nor too short, but there were a few parts where I was like ya OK, that can't happen, but hey it's a movie, it wasn't one of my ultimate favourites, but if you love spy movies, this one is right up there.",Dr. No

I was hyped for seeing this, judging from all the good reviews but I just can't share the same opinion.. This James Bond didn't feel like the charming and cold man that he is later on in the frachise and the overall story and script felt very bland and bad. It was difficult to sit through this whole film, but I did it and even the rushed ending didn't make this film worth-while..",Dr. No

268,ericksonsam60,"""World Domination, Same Old Dream""",8,14 February 2012,"This is the first entry in the James Bond series, the longest running franchise in movie history that has practically become a cinematic institution. Although, this first Bond film is the least elaborate, it is the one of the most easily enjoyable and succeeds as a modestly entertaining spy thriller.Sean Connery is the first actor to play the role of James Bond (codename: 007), a British Secret Service Agent that uses his sophistication and machismo to get out of danger. He is also pompous and a terrible womanizer. Yet, at the end of the day he always saves the world once again from villains bent on global domination. In Dr. No, Bond travels to Jamaica to investigate a missing colleague only to discover a scheme by Dr. No to destroy the entire U.S. space program.However, one inevitable flaw that this film has is that it's now dated. Unlike, the later Bond films there are no special gadgets or big explosions nor is it done on the biggest of budgets. Even the opening credit sequence is different than the rest. Usually, we get a song by a pop star with sexy girls dancing. Here, we get bunch of circles changing color followed by a silhouette of three blind men to the tune of ""Three Blind Mice"". To enjoy Dr. No one must realize it is a product of its time. The first entry in any series often introduces its concept rather than expands on it.Yet, more than any of its predecessors it much truer to the espionage genre. Here, Bond truly acts like a spy rather than being an action hero in the vein of Indiana Jones and Rambo. He quite cold blooded (as his killing of Professor Dent showed). Also, he shows more detective skills than getting into many shootouts. Over the years the Bond films started to stray away from Ian Fleming's original vision becoming more like a comic book that sometimes bordered on the outrageous. The major strength of Dr.No is that it is true to its source.The lack of extravagant set-pieces is more than made up for with style and meaty plotting. The film is slickly scripted full of action, clever one-liners, and suspenseful moments. Joseph Wiseman gives an excellent performance in the title role, ranking as one the first and best Bond villains, and Ursala Andress makes a sexy first Bond girl. It still contains many quintessential Bond elements as well as fine 60's flavor.Despite missing some of the more colorful Bond elements, it is a solid debut for 007.",Dr. No

Furthermore the acting and the action is wooden in the extreme and there is just no followup to a lot of the action that takes place. The ""green"" screen action looks awful and people moves from one place to another arbitrarily. This movie has one thing going for it and that is that is is the start of a franchise. It is just indefensible that this has such a high ranking. There are several other Bond-movies that works on either a comedic or action oriented level but this is just pitiful. Notable as a crucial point in the history of action movies and that is it.",Dr. No
270,uroshnor54,Okay,7,1 March 2014,"The first time I watched DR. NO, which was a few years ago, I was pretty impressed. It had a pretty low budget (in today's money, it cost only around $8.5 million) but it was pretty fun to watch. But watching it again, I kind of thought it was only okay. I thought it was interesting how I used to think THUNDERBALL was boring but now I really like that movie.DR. NO moves along pretty slowly and the climax isn't very good. I remembered it being a bit longer than it actually was. And I don't get how nobody on Crab Key cares that he somehow got out of his cell and is looking for Ursula Andress. I mean, he even says something like ""Where's the girl I came with?"" How are all the people in Dr. No's lair alright with him just walking around like that? There are a few good scenes, though. The part where he shoots Dent was kind of cool. Dent was unarmed and I thought it was kind of unnecessary but it's only a movie. The tarantula scene was good too. Ursula Andress was alright. I wouldn't say her emerging from the sea was the ""sexiest moment in screen history"" but she was pretty sexy, there's no denying that. I thought Zena Marshall was prettier, though, and her character was also more interesting than Honey Ryder.Overall, DR. NO is okay but I wouldn't say it's amazing or anything.",Dr. No

The title didn't fit the movie, it focuses on the mysterious villain known as Dr. No, which Bond killed less than 3 minutes, well he didn't even killed him. This is the first time I saw Sean Connery as James Bond, and I'm expecting that his other Bond movies are better than this one, and I mean they should be, because majority of people says that his the best actor who ever played that role.",Dr. No

273,Sharkey360,Simple but one of the best Bond movies ever!,10,30 December 2004,"The James Bond franchise has so many films in its library, so many that one can get confused as to which film to watch, which story to pay attention to and which star to be seen.And with the current trend of making action films (big budget special effects and tons of action) today, mystery, suspense and character-driven plots have all suffered badly in the 007 franchise.As for the original Bond movie Dr. No, I can start by saying that its simplicity as well as Sean Connery make it one of the BEST BOND FLICKS ever! Why do I like Dr. No better than most other Bond flicks?: 1) There is no overload of explosions or special effects or action scenes. These elements never overwhelm the story telling.2) The story is simple yet more detailed and more enjoyable to watch than that of other flicks like Man With The Golden Gun, Tomorrow Never Dies and Licence to Kill. In addition, Dr. No's story can be taken seriously.3) Story is character-driven and the use of mystery and suspense is VERY refreshing after watching too many explosions and special effects happen on screen (Die Another Day anyone?).4) Sean Connery's performance is no less amazing and his use of charm, coolness and cruelty truly defined James Bond. No matter how hard others tried, Connery will always be the king of Bonds.5) Ursulla Andress, similar to Connery, is STILL the queen of all Bond Girls not only because of her hot look but also of her excellent portrayal of Honey Rider. On screen, Ursulla has both the appeal of a fighting lady, the helplessness of damsels and the beauty that satisfies viewers. If Bond were to marry again, Honey is number 1 for him.6) Director Terence Young succeeded in keeping the pace right (mostly moving in medium-pace) which effectively balanced the presentation and prevented it from boring or exciting the viewer too much.. There are lots of details to pay attention to plus the characters are very well told.7) Dr. No is definitely one of the best Bond villains, probably the best. Joseph Wiseman's performance as the half-German/half-Chinese villain is great to watch and like Connery he had coolness and cruelty on screennote how cool Dr. No was when he resisted Bond's attempt to provoke him. To check things carefully, Bond and Dr. No are essentially as bad as each other. One works to kill and destroy like the other. The makeup work on Wiseman is excellently convincing. Performance-wise, Wiseman's Dr. No is better and more appealing than that of villains Gustav Graves, Stromberg, Largo and others.8) Dr. No's production values, despite the movie's age, still stands up well until now. The interior sets are very well designed (Dr. No's chamber where Bond and Honey had dinner with him plus Bond's Jamaica hotel room) and has mostly good props (some props look dated though).Dr. No is worth viewing not only as a classic spy movie but also as a historical art piece of motion pictures! No matter what nay-sayers say, Dr. No will always be the model Bond flick for all sequels to be compared with.And let us not forget that 007 creator Ian Fleming himself was greatly involved with this movie's production. Dr. No has a plot that can be told clearly, be taken seriously and enjoyed from start to finish. And it has a cast of characters greatly delivered by the actors. Many other Bond films failed when compared to Dr. No on these categories.Highly recommended viewing!",Dr. No
274,Dock-Ock,A Rather Bland Start,6,21 September 2001,"For the Bond Addicts who have grew up on a diet of high octain and explosive Bond Movies that glittered like meteors across the screen throughout the 1970's and 1980's Dr No WILL come as something of a shock. It has little of the charm, style or wit that would come to make later entries in the series such classics. Iam speaking of course with a reverse point of view. Reviewing Dr No as a film in its own right it isn't all that a bad film, although not as good as some have said. It is impossible not to compare it to other Bond movies, and so that is were my opinion comes from.For starters, the openng Gun Barrel sequence is surprisingly good. As is the monty Norman themes. Then the opening title sequence has none of the sexuality of Maurice Binder's later Gems. Once the ""Three Blind Mice"" song is played, you know this movie has dated. Sean Connery however is the real saving grace of the film. He towers above everyone else in the cast, showing good signs for the future. His Bond in this movie is more colder and animalistic than in future outings. The script by Joseph Manciewicz and Richard Maibaum has dated terribly. This is because in future, Bond Movies would come to revelutionise the whole action movie genre, and set the standards. The standards in Dr No, are probably based on glamorising Ealing Crime or Crime B-Movies from the 1950's. This looks very odd in a Bond Film to say the least. Also, the tension between M and Bond isn't as potent here, Bernard Lee does well, but he comes over as more lovable in future films. Plus there is no Q!!! Wich equals no gadgets and therefore no fun! In all these things mix together and Dr No is perhaps the most boring Bond movie.On the plus side, Joseph Wiseman makes a very creepy Dr No. He is the very essence of Comic Book Villainary. He looks like he has just wondered in from a James Whale movie, with his metal hands and blank expression. There is also Ursulla Andress to look at. Whilst not the most stunning Bond girl she certainly is very beautiful indeed, and handles the role of Honey Rider well. Her voice is dubbed!Overall then, Terence Young handles the direction well, and the film flows along at a nice pace. But the feeling is that this is the bottom of an enormous tower of fun wich the Bond films would regenerate into in future. As a starting post though Dr No is quite good.",Dr. No
275,CharlieGreenCG,Dr. No stands as a highlight in the Bond film series!,8,31 December 2013,"Although Goldfinger may have been the movie that started the Bond phenomenon, Dr. No first made the exciting debut of Bond in May 1962. American film producer Albert R. 'Cubby' Broccoli became interested in bringing the James Bond novels into feature films; however he discovered that the rights already belonged to the Canadian producer Harry Saltzman. The two were introduced, but Saltzman refused to sell the rights, but instead offered to co-produce the films with Broccoli. And together in partnership they successfully produced Bond films together until 1975. They made offers to Guy Green, Guy Hamilton and Ken Hughes to direct the film; however all of them turned it down. They eventually signed Terence Young as the director. Together Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Terence would be able to make an impression of James Bond and create the nostalgic essence of the character from the book to the film, and did it work? Absolutely!In the film, James Bond is sent to the island of Jamaica, (Kingston) to investigate the death of a fellow agent. The murder trail leads him to the underground bass of Dr. No, who is plotting end the US space program. Although Dr. No was produced on a low budget of only one million dollars, at the box office it achieved financial success of fifty nine million dollars! Including the talents of the young Sean Connery, Joseph Wiseman and upcoming actress Ursula Andress Dr. No makes the quintessential Bond film, creating a very successful start to the film series.Most of the iconic Bond conventions are shown in the movie, beginning with the signature gun barrel sequence, also including the mentions of key character roles, the distinctive James Bond theme song, his drink choice of a 'Shaken and not stirred' Vodka Martini, and of course the Bond's introduction. 'Bond... James Bond' a phrase which has become famous over the world. Film composer Monty Norman was invited by Broccoli to produce the soundtrack, however due to work commitments he could only produce certain parts. This included the famous James Bond theme song, which is featured over the beginning movie gun barrel and also several times throughout the movie. The rest of the soundtrack for the movie was completed by John Barry - who would go on to produce the movie scores for eleven more Bond films. Originally Thunderball was intended to be the first Bond film, but there was a legal dispute with the film's producer, Kevin McClory, as a result Dr No was made first. Although Dr. No was the first Bond movie, it was not the first debut for the character; Bond was first introduced in 1952, ten years previous in the novel 'Casino Royale'.The search for Bond... Because Ian Fleming's Bond novels were not widely popular at the time producers, Saltzman and Broccoli tried to get an popular film actor to portray Bond. Various actors were initially chosen for the role including; Cary Grant, Richard Johnson, Patrick McGoohan, David Niven and even the young Roger Moore! Ultimately the producers turned to 30-year old Sean Connery for a contract of five feature films. Personally, this was a successful choice- Connery made the perfect chemistry between both humour and serious film acting.Dr No 'The names Bond. James Bond.'The title of the film comes from the villain's formal name, and also from the 1958 novel by Ian Fleming of the same title. Portrayed by Joseph Wiseman; the character of Dr. No is played very well and has been brought from the novel to screen with great sophistication, whilst not seeing him until the last thirty minutes of the film, suspense is built throughout the film leading up to it, with mentions of and only hearing his deeming voice. Dr. No acts on part of the crime organisation SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) which is a recurring part of various Bond movies. In his villainous scheme Dr. No is plotting to destroy the US space program. Also in the movie - standing as the first official Bond girl - Swiss actress Ursula Andress makes her debut as Honey Ryder; an independent woman who regularly trespasses onto the island of Crab Key looking for seashells, where she consequently meets Bond. Due to Ursula's heavy accent her scents were dubbed by Nikki Van Der Lyl. Her entrance remains as a cinematic icon in movie history; where she emerges from the ocean in her white bikini with two large sea shells. As a homage to this in the 2002 James Bond film 'Die Another Day' actress Halle Berry also emerges from the sea in a similar bikini in a similar fashion.Released on 05th October 1962 - Dr. No was met at the box office as a financial success; gaining fifty nine times the amount of its budget! At the time of release it met mediocre reviews, but in years to follow it has become more popular with critics and fans - still often appearing in 'top movies, top iconic movie moments' and other movie lists and reviews Dr. No stands a highlight in the Bond film series.",Dr. No
276,carlwilkessob,Slow burn start for 007,6,15 January 2021,I wasn't overly taken by Dr No. I guess it must have been enthralling at the time but didn't grab me. The scene of Sean Connery and Ursula Andress singing together is just cringe. I found it slow and tedious. What was to follow next was far better,Dr. No
277,jordansepticeye,"Great,Simple Start To One of The Most Iconic Franchises Ever",8,9 August 2016,"The best part about this movie is its simplicity,while other Bond movies go for big action set pieces and crazy villains,Dr. No focuses on the storyline.Dr. No has a pretty simple plot,it's basically just a mystery about finding out who killed a fellow MI6 agent and who Dr. No is.It has great suspense and a great villain who doesn't appear until the very last twenty minutes,usually that would count as a con,but that just adds to how intimidating he is,he also seems realistic,unlike most Bond villains.The action,while there isn't much of it,is pretty good when it's there,it's suspenseful and done well,although the action does feel too short.Sean Connery is great as Bond,saying some great lines.He even feels slightly darker than in other movies,shooting a man for fun after he already killed him.He also has great chemistry with the Bond Girls of the movie.All in all,this is a great start for the Bond films,although it has a few flaws,with pacing issues and a slight lack of action,cons aside,Dr. No is a fun movie,and a sign of bigger and better things to come.",Dr. No
278,unbend_5440,Dr. No,9,26 March 2004,"In some ways, the first James Bond movie just happened to be the last one that really trusted the novel by Ian Fleming as a guide. While Dr. No is not the spectacular Bond movie by action or excitement, it does have one of the better scripts. And the plotting of all sequences sometimes works better than just gunfights and car chases. I'll go through a few opinions on the standard James Bond formula elements.BOND- Connery played Bond really well. He did not yet seem as comfortable with the humor as he would be later on with Thunderball, but he understood the character that Ian Fleming wrote. So much credit needs to be given to Connery for this movie, since every other performance by every other Bond after him was based on this.VILLAIN- The Dr. No character from the book was really cool, but there's something missing. He's doesn't have quite the intimidation of Red Grant, and not quite the power of Goldfinger. Joseph Wiseman plays the character very well, and who doesn't love seeing a crazy german/chinaman with steel claws. Not my favourite villain, but a decent one.FINAL ACTION SEQUENCE- What really surprises me is how well the climax of Dr. No plays, even stacked up next to modern action movies. It's relatively short, and there's not a lot of development of worldwide danger, but Bond's escape is exciting. Maybe because it's not about a guy relying on gadgets. Instead he's improvising using his wits. something that was a lot more prominent in the books. There's a real sense of danger because James Bond's life is in danger. For some reason it's a lot more exciting this way. However, I know others agree that this could have been even more amazing if the deleted scene involving the CRAG ATTACK had been included.Final comments. Quarrel still remains one of the best sidekicks. The opening credits originated a style that has been imitated in more than just this franchise. And of course, Dr. No the movie gave birth to the coolest action hero in history. Regardless of it's minor flaws, this movie is a flat out CLASSIC.",Dr. No
279,rneil95,The Film That Started It All,8,31 October 2013,"Bond. James Bond. One of the most well-known cinematic icons of all time, Agent 007 has lit up the silver screen and wowed audiences for over 50 years, and this franchise shows no signs of slowing down. The character first appeared in author Ian Fleming's 1953 novel ""Casino Royale,"" but he's best known for the long-lived film franchise by Eon Productions. James Bond has since been ingrained as a major component of popular culture, redefining the film industry upon the release of the early films. Audiences hadn't seen anything like it at the time, and they couldn't get enough of it. Bond has since blown up on a global scale, and it all ties back to this first film, ""Dr. No.""Despite being the first film in the series, ""Dr. No"" is actually based on Fleming's sixth novel in the series. As the inaugural Bond film, director Terence Young had a blank slate to work with. The clichés and archetypes that are instantly connected with the franchise today had not yet been established. Fleming wanted David Niven to play Bond, but the studio ultimately went with Sean Connery, who played a major role in defining what the popular view of Bond would become. He simply exudes confidence through his voice, appearance, and attitude. From that genre- defining first moment where we're introduced to Bond, he instantly slips right into the character. It's no wonder people often cite Connery as the definitive Bond, because his performance laid a lot of that groundwork for future incarnations. He's easily one of the best aspects of the film.The film sends agent 007 on a mission to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow MI6 agent, Strangways. While there, he teams up with CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord), a native fisherman named Quarrel (John Kitzmiller), and eventually, a woman named Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress) to investigate the goings-on at a mysterious island called Crab Key, owned by the sinister Dr. No, played with an eerie calmness by Joseph Wiseman. The plot itself is relatively standard Bond fare by now, but Dr. No makes for a satisfying villain, his plan is suitably evil (""World domination. Same old dream""), and his affiliation with the criminal organization SPECTRE leads to their recurring involvement in subsequent installments.""Dr. No"" has a unique, naive quality about it. There's no tongue-in-cheek self-awareness here, this is the first glimpse that audiences had to all the different tropes that would develop in the series, and they're done supremely well. I've already gushed enough about how perfect Connery is as Bond, but his supporting cast is also suitably talented. Ursula Andress sets the bar high for all subsequent ""Bond girls"" that would follow suit, and to this day, she's still one of the best. The production design by Ken Adam, while not yet achieving the grandeur of later films, is still brilliant, establishing the iconic island lair that has since become a staple of the series. Dr. No himself, while underused, is a suitably formidable foe, and Joseph Wiseman makes the most of his limited screen time.The film is incredibly dated, and in many respects, it doesn't hold up well. However, I don't necessarily fault the film for that. It's definitely a product of its time, and if looked at through the proper context, it functions as a brilliant time capsule film, giving audiences a unique look into the cultural and geopolitical beliefs of the time. I would have loved to see audience reactions to this movie back when it first came out. It's a really revolutionary film, and at the very least, it's worth checking out if only to see where it all started.",Dr. No
280,DMP-2,"Good start, to one of the best film series",5,2 December 2000,"Dr. No is an excellent film, although I will say there are a lot of better Bond films. This film loaded was some great actions, that other Bond films should envy. For instance (May plot spoiling), Bond escapes through a ventilation system in Dr. No laboratory. No Bond had Bond done that in yet. The other thing about that is that has become much more of contemporary action sequence (DIE HARD (1988), and newer Bond films that try to be contemporary never do it. But this stands towards the top being competing against other Bond films, like Live And Let Die (1973) and its sequel From Russia With Love (1963). The latter being the weaker of its opponents.",Dr. No
281,rutherfordh-81993,A Very Good Start,8,10 October 2020,"Dr. No had to begin the James Bond franchise, and it begins it fabulously. Sean Connery is fantastic in the role, and is a very good resemblance of the original book character. The scenery of Jamaica is lovely, and feels like a holiday. While there are no gadgets which are later crucial in other films, it delivers some good action and tells a great story. It is a very strong film.",Dr. No
282,mattymatt30,Say Yes to one of the best Bond films!,8,16 March 2004,"Dr. No, the first of the Bond films, is undeniably one of the best in the series, but not perfect. The choice of Sean Connery as Bond was critical, because his presence and charisma MADE Bond. It's a little disappointing that he was not the gutsy he-man I thought he was, because even children let tarantulas crawl on them. Maybe he's arachnophobic. Aside from that, he is tough, suave, and convincing as James Bond. Never mind that he was coached to be Bond by Terence Young the director - whom almost everyone says was really the most like Bond in real life, he learned well. 
  The bad guys are great, the sets designed by the amazing Ken Adam give this and the other early Bond films their unique 'look', and the story is somewhat believable. Could be the best Bond film behind 'From Russia with Love'.",Dr. No
283,aernest,The first of many...,8,19 February 2010,"I have set myself a task to review and write about all the Bond movies, since I am a self-avowed Bond addict. Bond movies are my cinematic comfort food - I want to watch them when I'm sick, or bored, or happy, or sad. There is nothing like the opening bars of the Bond theme to take me out of this life and into a world of beautiful people, exotic locales, and megalomaniac villains who will, of course, be defeated spectacularly by the final reel. My friends and I played James Bond when we were little - now, as an adult, I look forward to each new release. But there's nothing like the first time - in this case, Dr. No. This movie is the archetype - it sets the pattern for every Bond movie afterward. As other reviewers have pointed out, most of the recurring characters (M, Moneypenny, Felix Leiter) are set with this movie (Q would appear later). This movie was like nothing I'd ever seen before - action and yet elegance. Sure, this movie is dated now, but it was a revelation at the time. It is nothing new to say that Connery is the definitive Bond, and I'm SO glad Roger Moore was unavailable, since he later became one of my least favorite Bonds. Ursula Andress becomes the model for dozens of Bond girls to follow, and she's one of the best. The not-so-subtle racism makes one squirm these days, but it is certainly not out of line with the books or the times. It's still worth a watch, despite its age. Enjoy.",Dr. No

Cliché story, music, effects and 1960s vibe and it works extremely well.
It's the original time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the start to understand Bond better and watch how the movie series began and evolved over time.

Doctor No shares many of the elements that novel had. Doctor No is very exciting to watch and is also up there with one of the best Bond films to date.

While it may not be one of the best like Goldfinger or GoldenEye or Skyfall, it gives off a good start to one of the greatest movie characters and franchises ever. Plus, it has the best and original James Bond, the one and only Sean Connery and has, in my opinion, the best Bond girl, Honey Ryder played by Ursela Andress. And while the action or gadgets scenes may not be as thrilling to today standards, they are still fun to watch. And though the pacing is a bit slow and dated, it still keeps up with the plot. And it's also interesting to see what Sean Connery was like with the role that made him an screen icon.",Dr. No
288,sterlinrivera-2000,A Fantastic First Entry,9,2 January 2020,"Dr. No was the film that started it all, and after 5 and a half decades, it still remains to be an awesome first entry to the James Bond franchise.The movie is about a spy, James Bond, a.k.a Agent 007 (Sean Connery), has to battle a genius, known as Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) as he wants to destroy the U.S space program. Before he battles him, he goes to Jamaica where he not only meets the beautiful Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress) but has to find the massive island headquarters that contains the evil plan from Dr. No.Dr. No was awesome. Like I said, they started things off on the right foot. Yes, the movie may not have huge action and everything like most of the other Bond films do, but it's reasonable because they didn't know how things were going to turn out and the film happened to be very successful.The story was great, understandably accurate, and ran in a great pace for close to 2 hours. The cast was perfect. Sean Connery is, without a doubt, my favorite actor that plays James Bond. He has such great personality, appearance, and intelligence to playing the spy. His performance has always been very top notch. Ursula Andress was great as the sidekick woman, Honey Ryder, and Joesph Wiseman did a phenomenal job as the antagonist, Dr. No.The action was also very good, but this is only the beginning as things get even more interesting in the later Bond films with action sequences.Bottom line, Dr, No is one of the best James Bond films and was a great first entry to the awesome franchise.",Dr. No
289,sn319,A Grand Start,7,7 April 2015,"Dr. No may be the first film in the Bond franchise, but it is one of the better ones. It stays pretty true to the novel and manages both the intrigue of a spy movie and the action that will later be a major selling point of the franchise. In this film Dr. No is threatening to topple American rockets and Bond is sent in to uncover the plot after a fellow agent is killed. He travels across Jamaica, eventually heading to Crab Key for the final confrontation.The fights are cheesy and the movie is pretty cheap but what is here is nearly all the components of a Bond film. M, Q, Moneypenny, the opening song. It's definitely dated but maintains a certain old time charm. Sean Connery shines as Bond and the other actors and actresses are also wonderful.There are problems though. The Three Blind Mice who seem to important at the beginning never show up or get subdued later on. There's a lot of editing errors, one great one being the sound of monkeys being used when birds take off.In the end Dr. No is a good overall movie, one I'd suggest.",Dr. No
290,tonynworah,Meet Bond. James Bond,8,18 January 2011,"""I admire your courage Miss...?"" ""Trench. Sylvie Trench. I admire your luck Mr...?"" ""Bond. James Bond""With those three words, against the background of the famous James Bond theme, an unknown Scottish actor called Sean Connery introduced 007, the most famous super spy secret agent in the world, a suave sophisticated killing machine, a man everyman wants to be and every woman wants to be with.I still regard this introduction as one of the most memorable cinematic scenes in history. It was just as good as the scene in Goldfinger, but let me not get ahead of myself.In the casino just before Bond gets his briefing to investigate the murder of a fellow British agent, Bond was engaged in a game of cards with Slyvie Trench a voluptuous beautiful woman who was to herald all the other Bond women that was to follow-beautiful, seductive and deadly. I've always felt that the movie did not do enough justice to her. I mean she must get some credit for the arrogant way of introducing herself with the surname first and which inspired Bond to do the same. Anyway life is not fair...Despite that, Dr. No, the first ""official"" James Bond movie is a gem. After Bond get his briefing from M played inscrutably by Bernard Lee, 007 travels to Jamaica where he meets CIA agent Felix Leither (Jack Lord of Hawaii 5-0 fame). Leither is on a mission to investigate interference with their missile signals so both men team up to face a common enemy.The plot is tight, exciting, with enough type of good old fashioned detective to elevate it from a cheap spy thriller. Aided by Quarrel,a Jamaican they try to penetrate Dr. No's Lair and it is one of the islands that he meets Honey Rider. (Hmmmmm-Ian Flemming and his suggestive names)The meeting with Honey Rider was another memorable scene in Dr. No where Honey Rider(Ursula Andress), clad in a bikini and a knife, emerges from the sea like a golden sea goddess or nymph and makes our good old English macho spy start singing ""Underneath the Mango Tree..."" (Ahhh!I will sing that song a million times if it will guarantee such a woman coming to me from the ocean).Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your point of view), such a thing can happen only to James Bond. That is why we both love and hate the lucky bastard.Then we finally meet the bad guy Dr. No. A half-Chinese scientist played by Joseph Wiseman. His dead pan face and expressionless monologue would set the standard for all other Bond villains. He was great and the verbal face off between him and Bond is one of the best dialogues I have ever seen in Bond movies.Other stand out characters were the a trio of assassins masquerading as Three Blind Men, Quarrel, and Bond's evil paramour.But still kudos belongs to Sean Connery and his brilliant interpretation of James Bond, which was different from what Ian Flemimg had in mind. But later he admitted that in retrospect, he would have moulded Bond's character in the form of Connery. To me Connery is James Bond. His acting in Dr. No would be considered harsh and impatient and rough but still he managed to pull it off and endeared himself to millions of female fans.The action in Dr. No would be considered quite tame by today's standards but then critics called it torturous, violent, racist and sexist.Despite all this, Dr. No is a great movie. And a classic.",Dr. No
291,campbell-russell-a,Dr No - Welcome to the 60's Mr Bond,10,10 June 2012,"Dr No was the first adult film that my parents allowed me to see on my own in a cinema. The thrill I felt as the opening credit sequence flashed across the screen in sync with the dynamic Bond theme will live forever in my memory and the film as it unfolded was then an induction into the adult world of sophistication. I didn't get the dark tongue-in-cheek humor nor did I question just how Dr No built and ran an undersea, nuclear powered plant designed to interfere with U.S. missile tests, nor why he and SPECTRE would go to all this trouble to upset the Yanks. But, as an adult, I understand why I and the rest of the world withheld our disbelief and went on the ride.Dr No was and remains a triumph of style over substance. In the hands of less skilled film makers, it would have been a B grade potboiler but because it was made by an extraordinarily talented and sophisticated team who had sprung from backgrounds that allowed them to make a multi- million dollar film on a budget of less than a million, it worked beyond all expectations. Of course Connery was the key but who would have had the foresight to discern just how right he would be for the part before he proved he could do it? Some say he grew into the part but that is not true. Watch the first scene he ever did as Bond when he walks through the airport in Jamaica. The confidently casual stride and the almost nonchalant shielding of his face with his hat to deny a female enemy agent a photo of him are indicative of a secret agent who is in command of the situation. When at the end of the sequence Bond deduces that the driver, Mr Jones, is also an enemy agent, Connery delivers a look that is to be pure Bond from then on. There is a sense of ruthlessness and a darkly gratuitous anticipation of what is to come when dealing with an adversary that made Connery as Bond so exciting and credible. He was Bond from the beginning as much as Dr No was the blueprint for the Bond series. This is what made Dr No as the first in the Bond series so remarkable. The first in the series needed almost no future tweaking. The prior-to-the-title, mini-adventure sequence was perhaps the only real improvement made in subsequent Bond films. Probably the only Bond film to break many of the Bond conventions set in Dr No was From Russia with Love. F.R.W.L. was almost a regulation spy versus spy story with the stakes set a lot lower than world domination or cornering the world market in gold. After this, Bond films were Dr No in almost every respect. The gadgets may have become more high tech than a Geiger counter and the stunts went beyond car chases and fist fights but in essence they were Dr No set in a different country and with another super-villain displaying the same confidence in his own ability that Joseph Wiseman's unnerving control of face and voice evinced.What a feat of film making was Dr No! It was made in 1962 which was in many ways the last year of the 1950's. By 1963, Dr No had ushered in the 60's as surely as The Beatles and Cassius Clay who also appeared as if on cue. Everything begins and ends at exactly the right time and place. Well it certainly did in 63!",Dr. No
292,kmberger,The one that started it all.,7,15 December 2002,"Now forty years old, 'Dr. No' seems dated to someone of this generation seeing it for the first time.  But remember this: Without 'Dr. No', not only is there no James Bond (the most successful franchise in movie history), there probably is no 'action' genre to speak of.  It's an important film for its place in Bond folklore and pop culture - but it's no slouch as a film itself.The first of Ian Fleming's novels to be brought to the screen, 'Dr. No' offers up the Bond formula: A dashing leading man (Sean Connery, the first and best Bond), a bigger-than-life villain (Dr. No, played coldly by Joseph Wiseman), a procession of gorgeous women (the most notable being Ursula Andress' Honey Rider - probably the gold standard of Bond girls), and action galore.Many key Bond elements are introduced for the first time.  M. The Walther PPK.  Bond's predilictions for baccarat and martinis (shaken, not stirred). SPECTRE.  The most famous theme music ever, as played by John Barry's orchestra.  And of course, the attitude and style that marks these films. 
For its time, 'Dr. No' is a landmark of action.  But viewed today, most of its elements are either dated (rockets to the moon) or have become ingrained as cliche (island fortresses, femme fatales, ""Since you won't live long enough to use the information, I'll tell you..."").  The car chases have blue-screened backdrops and the sets are often hokey and filled with smoky pyrotechnics.  Even given all that, however, 'Dr. No' is quite a lot of fun. Wiseman's chillingly arrogant villain sets the tone for all future Bond adversaries even though he has precious little screen time.  Andress is still one of the most beautiful women ever to grace a Bond film.  And of course, to most people, Sean Connery simply IS James Bond.An all-time classic that has its place in history assured.",Dr. No

James Bond goes to Jamaica to investigate disruption of rocket launches. Agent of CIA Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) co-operates with him. Guilty is found from an island of Crab Key where Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) keeps his jamming equipments. Dr. No is a member of criminal organization SPECTRE.
The movie isn't perfect but still very good. The Plot is exciting and actors are memorable specially Connery and Ursula Andress as beautiful Honey Rider. Wiseman is so freak as Dr. No that you don't forget him. Scenes are believable except some which include outdated special effects. Sean Connery is still the best Bond actor in my opinion.

This film also introduces audiences to the smooth talking charm of Sean Connery who is able to turn the character into icon in his first quote: ""Bond, James Bond."" Who could have guessed back in the day that this character would become the star of the longest running film series of all time? Now, Dr. No is a good Bond film, but it isn't the best, as it is soon surpassed by films such as From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, but Dr. No does remain a great film as Sean Connery is a demanding screen presence through and through. He hasn't gotten the character to its full-potential just yet, but he certainly is close to that point (he'd perfect it in Goldfinger).In the film we are introduced to the Bond charm and the essentials such as pretty girls, exotic locations, eccentric villains, and elaborate traps. So Bond enters in a grand fashion bringing in action that is well-ahead of its time which. Some of the action and ideas presented in this movie are things you wouldn't see much of until later in the 60s.The final verdict is that while Dr. No is the BEST Bond film it is the first in the series and as such deserves great respect for all the things it introduces. It introduces Sean Connery and all the elements of a GOOD Bond film. This is why Dr. No is certainly the Bond film for beginner fans to the series. It is probably the BEST way to introduce someone to the Sean Connery Bond becauseIt's how the entire world was introduced to him in 1963! Also, the new DVDs have great picture quality and are well worth buying if you do not own the previous Special Edition of Dr. No. The picture is crisp and the sound is good and it comes highly recommended.",Dr. No
297,bock_g,A well paced action adventure.,9,2 March 2020,"In honor of the upcoming 25th James Bond film, ""No time to Die"", I've decided to rewatch and review all the films from the official canon. The first film, ""Dr. No"" (1962) has been relatively low on my list of favorite Bond films because it's not as big and fun as the later installments. Rewatching it today, I enjoyed it very much-it was just as exhilarating as any of the Bond films. While there are many dated elements and flaws that are visible from a contemporary viewer-in particular the use of the rear screen projection and dubbing, there are many subtle moments which are brilliant. One example is the briefing scene in M's office. When M takes out his pipe, Bond offers his lighter to light it. However, M stands up and moves away, lighting it himself. I felt that this established M's stern nature against Bond. Another motif that was prominent but not overtly portrayed was the British-American rivalry. In this film, Felix Leiter (played by Jack Lord) is introduced as a foil rather than the ally we see in the later films. He and Quarrel (played by John Kitzmiller) are portrayed as relatively incompetent compared to Bond, the British agent. Leiter even uses the term ""Limey"" in one of the earlier scenes. When Bond and Quarrel are sailing to Crab Key, Leiter offers to go but the British agent claims that this is ""his beat"" and that the Americans can come later. This sentiment was more prominent in the novels, and obviously due to it's subsequent success in the US it completely disappeared. Sean Connery is spectacular as always. I thought his verbal confrontation with Dr. No was his best acting. Scenes involving Bond escaping from his prison cell in Dr. No's lair, using his wits still holds up very well today. The score, while overusing the title theme a little too much, was good especially in the climatic scenes of the film. Overall, it's definitely one of the best in the series for a good reason.",Dr. No
298,KnightLander,Still one of the series' best,7,20 June 2005,"In 1962, Ian Fleming's creation first appeared on the big screen. Over forty years later, ""Dr. No"" is still one of the best films to feature the character of 007, filled with adventure, action, beautiful locations, and beautiful women.Sean Connery stars as the suave and sophisticated British agent, who here is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a colleague. The trail ultimately leads him to the feared island of Dr. No (played with villainous inhumanity by Joseph Wiseman), a mysterious figure whose criminal vendettas could endanger humanity.Connery makes an impressive debut as James Bond, who is just as cool in his earliest screen appearance as he is in the more recent ones. Wiseman makes one of the most fantastic Bond villains, while ""Hawaii Five-O""'s Jack Lord portrays Felix Leiter. Although the beautiful setting and great cast are vital to the film, it's Ursula Andress who really steals the show. She made Honey Ryder heavenly then and she remains one of the most respected 007 girls to this day.The younger generation experiencing the original James Bond for the first time will find an enormous difference between this film and ""Die Another Day"" - but few will dare to say they prefer the latter over ""Dr. No"".",Dr. No
299,jonny_mcclatch,A solid start to one of the best ever movie franchises.,7,12 June 2019,"Okay it's not the most exciting film but it lays a lot of the ground work for James Bond as a character and a franchise. It doesn't have the gadgets and it's not overloaded with action although it definitely has it's moments. What truly goes unappreciated with Dr. No is that it's setting up famous lines, the high benchmark for what goes on to become the 'bond girl', the exotic location and it has a very underrated title sequence including the famous theme and gun barrel sequence.Imagine the Bond films without these, it would not be the same series that we know and love. That's the beauty of Dr No. it is rough around the edges especially some of the jump cuts but you can see the building blocks, Connery starts out a little wooden but gets better and better. Ursula Andress was the perfect choice for one of the most iconic cinema moments despite not being able to speak English for the role. It's definitely worth a watch even if it's just to see the iconography.",Dr. No
300,tomasg-69814,And So It Began.....,6,23 December 2015,"First EON 007 movie. Though script was worked out by book #6 from the typewriter of one Ian Fleming, the ""father"" of James Bond. With a budget of 1M$, of course it had it's shortcomings; a project like this could have failed easily in 1962 without the great luck of casting Sean Connery as MI6 finest, and producers who really felt for it, and gave it all in from the beginning. A nice spy-story who feels at age today (naturally) but has many classic moments that will stay strong in JB history. (The opening casino scene, of course, among others.) Further on they developed the package bit by bit: From Russia... was a little more homogeneous and stronger in many other ways. Then came the ""first"" James Bond movie as we know them still today; all the pieces came into place. The title song performance, the gadgets...well, you know what I mean. In 1964 the bond era began in earnest. That's another review.",Dr. No

There are also nice bonus features and the commentary which is often a reworking of older interviews clipped and inserted into places where they match the scenes is well done. If you can find the 50th anniversary collection on sale, it is worth getting if you enjoy behind the scenes information.",Dr. No
302,d-apergis,beyond criticism,7,19 December 2009,"A curious hybrid of detective mystery and sci-fi flick, ""Dr No"" is sparked up with visual flair and 60's pop artistry, and is effortlessly attractive for its little touches of crowd-pleasing vulgarity: the black and the Chinese people are seen as inferior races detached from morality (and therefore incomprehensible) while women are shamelessly treated as mere instruments of pleasure. By sixties' standards, the sadism for which the movies would become popular later on is also explicit here, as is sex.Still, this movie is beyond criticism simply because it introduced James Bond to movie audiences. And, with his iconic presence and sardonic wit, Connery made the character his own.",Dr. No
303,Pinky-12,The first James Bond film...,8,26 February 1999,"Sean Connery immortalized James Bond in his first attempt in the first screen version of a Bond Film.

It is the thirteenth best Bond film.RATING = 8 of 10",Dr. No
304,KEVMC,The Template For All Those To Follow,8,15 December 2002,"When Cmdr.Strangways and his secretary disappear without trace on Jamaica, British Intelligence send agent 007 James Bond to investigate. Once there, he slowly discovers that all the clues point to the small island of Crab Key, the base of a mysterious Chinese scientist, Dr.No.   The film that introduced Ian Fleming's character to the screen laid down the basic blueprint for the adventures that would follow. Many, though not all, of the key elements in the later films are on display here - exotic locales, beautiful girls, a sinister villain with a high-tech base, and an explosive finale. The character of Bond himself is suave and sophisticated, with a dry sense of humour. He seduces women with relative ease, but also kills in cold blood when necessary.   It's hard to imagine now, but for 1962 this was quite groundbreaking. It had a look and a feel all of its own - expensive, glamorous and modern - and helped to usher in the Swinging 60's.   The film itself stands up remarkably well 40 years on, due to a combination of factors. First, it has a taut plot which is well scripted by Richard Maibaum (who went on to write several more Bond films). Second, it's efficiently directed by Terence Young. A man of some sophistication himself, he took Sean Connery under his wing and moulded him into the character of Bond in terms of his dress, mannerisms etc. Third, Sean Connery himself. While the Bond of the films is more lighthearted than in the books, Connery manages to bring an air of ruthlessness and danger to the character, as well as the suavity. Fourth, Ken Adam's production design. For Dr.No's base he chose an angular, futuristic style, which lent the film its modern feel, and laid down the template for many of his future designs for Bond films. Finally, the music. It's so familiar these days, but at the time was different, fresh and new.   I'm sure that the generation of Bond fans that have only known Pierce Brosnan in the role may find 'Dr.No' old fashioned, slow and unspectacular. However, I was fortunate enough to see the Bond films in chronological order as they premiered on UK television in the mid 70's - can you believe it was 1975 before this saw the light of day on TV? Being an impressionable 8 year old at the time, it was magical to me, and started a love affair with Bond films that lasts to this day - despite 'Die Another Day'!",Dr. No
305,Ofisil8-850-238679,"Cheesy & Unrealistic, But Quite Fun!",6,4 January 2012,"Plot: 007, a secret agent of the British intelligence service has to stop a certain Dr. No, a mysterious figure who is hidden in an island in the Caribbean's.James Bond's first movie reeks of cheesiness, has that weird mid-60's atmosphere, is full of corny action scenes and its characters are so stereotypical that it gets hilarious. However it is somewhat entertaining and marked the beginning of many themes associated with the franchise. The excellent Jame's Bond theme, the beautiful girls and weird villains, the classic retro intro and so on. Sure it's not realistic, sure it's not flawless but its quite fun, at least for the first film.For those new to the James Bond Franchise, unlike the more recent films, where James Bond turns into a Rambo in a tuxedo kind of guy, in this film, like with most early Bond movies, the pacing is slow almost too slow at times. You won't see James Bond killing 10 goons with his Ak-47, instead you'll observe him as he works his way up too the main ploy, slowly gathering information. But try not to be discouraged by the lack of adrenaline pumping stunts, because Dr. No, (like many oldies), relies more in building tension rather than cracking up some fireworks to amuse you.Sean Connery steals the show in the role of 007, although I never really like the James Bond character. Some characters that get a smaller amount of screen time though, like the boss of 007 M. or his secretary Moneypenny are even better due to their wonderful chemistry, (and better acting). The rest of the crew do their job fine, although not as good as the main ones and this might seem as blasphemy but I hated most of the Bond chicks 0 charisma & 0 acting ability just some cute legs that talkHowever, Dr. No like almost all JB movies, is more like a cult film, a movie that a certain group of people will love while others will totally hate. First of all the plot is average and its value lies more in the way it is presented to you and believe me all JB is about is style. Also, you've got to be more than naïve not to see the shameless advertisement of expensive stuff and the depressing use of male\female stereotypes. Finally Dr. No while good for its time has aged badly, while other films of the franchise like Goldfinger, remain as fun as they were back then. As I've said, if you want realism, look elsewhere. However, although I usually hate the macho BS that the JB franchise is full of, I kinda like Dr. No, maybe because I don't take it to seriously I advise you to do the same.FINAL VERDICT: Style over substance, but entertaining nonetheless (6.5/10)[+] Stylish spy-flick [+] Paved the way for even better Bond movies[-] Average plot [-] Slow pacing. Not for Action buffs [-]Stereotypical, cheesy and unrealistic as hellAlso Check: From Russia With Love (1963) – Goldfinger (1964) – Ocean's Eleven (2001) – The Saint (1962-1969)",Dr. No
306,spinin,A classic piece of cinema where parts just haven't aged well,6,13 June 2021,"British secret agent James Bond, 007, in his first official on-screen adventure in the Bond film series, travels to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of another agent. Not very long after his arrival, he finds himself the target of attempts on his life. As he uses his wits to survive and gather clues, the trail leads him to the mysterious island of Crab Key. Together with his partner Quarrel, a local fisherman, Bond travels to Crab Key, where he soon meets the beautiful, shell-collecting Honey Rider, as well as the island's nefarious inhabitants. Crab Key is occupied by the evil genius Dr. No, who plans to harness nuclear energy to interfere with American space missions and to disrupt the balance of world powers.This is a good James Bond film, which doesn't really have many flaws, but it just lacks the polish and excitement of many of the later entries, including the one that followed it and immediately improved on the formula. On the plus side, there is Sean Connery's very solid performance. His first delivery of the ""Bond, James Bond"" line in the casino is iconic. He is suave, serious, athletic, and highly believable, both as a spy licensed to kill and as a slick charmer. His Bond moments are smaller here than in later movies. His final face-off with Professor Dent is certainly a memorable one. He has a lot of good quips throughout the movie and some good dialogue once he finally meets Dr. No.The first half does drag a bit. The pacing is relatively slow compared to the later Bond films. And so one has to take pleasure from the small moments like the ones I already mentioned. Once the action moves to Crab Key, the movie picks up in pace and suspense. Honey Rider is also iconic and she and Bond make a classic partnership. The action that takes place at Dr. No's lair is where the movie is at it's best. Though again relatively small scale compared to the films that followed, the sets are very memorable and original and one really gets a good feel for the place as Bond maneuvers throughout it. The technology that is showcased however, does feel very dated. The bleeps and buzzes that accompany readings from different radiation equipment and the anti-radiation suits can come off as humorous. As does the island ""monster"" when Bond, Honey, and Quarrel first encounter it. Joseph Wiseman's performance as Dr. No is also memorable, although his final battle with Bond is rather quick. His particular deformity, common in many Bond villains, happens to be that he has no hands and uses metal prosthetics instead. This comes into play during the final scene.Overall, this is an OK Bond film, when looking at it retrospectively. It ranks in the lower tier for me, although it isn't exactly flawed, per se. In terms of the ideas and execution for what it was at the time, and the franchise it started, it gets a 9/10. There is a lot to respect and admire here when one allows the time to take in the moments. Bond's maneuvering around Dr. No's lair was the highlight for me. However, the film does move a bit slow at times and the technology and special effects are the sort that helped inspire many of the moments in the Austin Powers movies. And when the subsequent three films improved upon and mastered the Bond formula so well in comparison, Dr. No stands more as just an interesting first try for me.",Dr. No
307,jackhamel1987,The James Bond Template.,8,7 April 2013,"Dr No was the original Bond film (not the first, but the original), that set the standard for all other Bond films that followed. It's not necessarily the best, but it is an absolute classic, and it really was the template not just for the Bond franchise, but other spy franchises as well. It has James Bond as we know him, it has the super-villain, it has the Bond girl, it has the locations, it has the allies and the enemies and it has that little bit of Bond magic that somehow allows us to like a sexist, callous womaniser who kills people!When two British communications agents are ruthlessly murdered in Jamaica (a previous British colony, and for some time the home of Bond create Ian Fleming), specialist MI6 operative James Bond is sent to the island to investigate. Upon arrival, he discovers that the murders of the agents were part of a cover-up into the activities of the mysterious Dr Julius No, who owns a secretive island. Carefully weaving his way into the lives of villains (Professor Dent - the first villainous Henchman, and Miss Taro, the insider at Government House), to the allies (Felix Liter, the CIA regular, and ill-fated Quarell), he sets about unravelling the mystery of Dr No, also finding his first Bond girl, the now iconic Honey Ryder and leading to the classic Bond-esque showdown between super-villain and spy.At the time, this was seen as a bit of a joke. But, Dr No and the character of Bond were hugely popular, and this set the standard. Whilst the production is dated, and lacks a truly quality finish because of the lack of funding at the time, there can be no doubt that this is a classic, and deserves a huge amount of praise for the following it created. Sean Connery was a relative unknown at the time of casting, but this is now his signature role, and I think most Bond fans will agree that he represents the best Bond. He oozes character, kindness, loyalty and bravery, whilst also representing the worst the man has to offer in ruthlessness, womanising and selfishness - and he does it so well that you just love the man in the role. Joseph Wiseman represents another classic piece of casting, taking on the role of Dr No (though he was not first choice - Christopher Lee and Noel Coward were both considered at some point), and creating a subtle, almost cartoonish super-villain who you can believe it some way exists somewhere.And of course, Ursula Andress set the standard for the Bond girl - a woman of beauty, but also a woman of resource and strength who Bond could rely on not just for the sex, but also for support in the hour of need.All in all, a very good Bond film that deserves great recognition. It might lack that final quality punch in terms of production, but everything else is there, and it's a whole of of fun.",Dr. No
308,chancey-23,"James Bond's first adventure, and it's one of the best",10,15 July 2012,"Sean Connery, the first actor to portray James Bond 007, starts out in this great start for 007 that sets the standards for the series. Not only does the film succeed in its pretty good story and its really great charismatic star, Connery, but it has a good villain and nice action scenes to boot. It's hard to criticize the early films because they didn't have an explosion every action scene just on that basis. Back then of course it wasn't necessary, and they rather gave the screen time that in following Bond films were spent on that and gave it to story. As I mentioned, Joseph Wiseman does very, very well as the first ever Bond villain, Dr. No. I also think that Ursula Andress as Honey Rider is one of the best Bond girls. So when it comes to James Bond films, this is one of the first to watch, not just because it's the first, but because it's one of the best.",Dr. No
309,tobybunning,Well this is going to be easy,10,1 November 2020,"I have always thought Daniel Craig was the best actor to play James Bond. He had the look of someone who you would not want to say ""hey let's finish this outside"" with and he had the smoothness that you always wanted when entering into a bar with on a Saturday night.When starting Dr No I didn't know what to expect but I knew not to compare it to the Daniel Craig films as they will have different styles in filming as well as budgets. Yes Dr No came with lack of explosions and massive fight scenes over building sites (Casino Royale) or a whole building exploding (Quantum Of Solace).
But Dr No came with its main focus being on story as well as character development.1
Sean Connerys Bond was suave, smooth and just all round charming, it is easy to see why so many people have voted him the best person to play Bond just based off of that.
2
When it came to the fighting you could also believe that he could hold his own whoever he was up against.

The supporting cast also played their characters well, they weren't just pure bland as is totally cliche when it comes to films, the original ""Bond Girl"" Ursula Andress pulled off her role particularly well as she was many boys/mens dream, especially as she is what started it all off when it came to all of the Bond films in the first place. Dr No was a seriously believable villain in this film its just a shame that he did not get much of a entrance earlier into the film except for a voice until right up til the final 1/2 hour but Joseph Wiseman played his character well in showing that his character has no emotions other than hatred towards the world, and it really shows by his expressions on his face.Overall they say Sean Connery is the best Bond

310,BrohmaBull007,First Marks the Worst for Connery,7,13 March 2006,"I like all of Connery's Bond films but if I had to choose his worst it is this one. The first Bond movie was a bit lackluster. It was great to see the talented Connery (in his early 30's) play Bond. We got to see Bond utter lines like ""youve had your six"" but I felt there were problems with this movie. The villain Dr. No is a VERY boring villain and doesn't really do anything but sit in his chair. The ""three blind mice"" assassins that kill high power people are pretty boring and have no build up at all. This movie overall its just James Bond doing James Bond things like keeping his own bedroom under surveillance and booby-trapping his closet. The plot doesn't take shape until about 80 minutes into the film when we FINALLY meet Dr. No. I also think that the whole ending ruined this movie. I wasn't too happy to the fact that Bond beat Dr. No in a 15 second fight sequence but also because the girl he was with did nothing to advance the story. Overall this movie is just James Bond doing James Bond things. This is a historic movie nonetheless but I prefer Connery's others over this one.",Dr. No
311,trekfan2001,One of the better Bond movies.,7,14 June 2003,"Dr No is probably one of the better ones, but the best is still to come in future Bond films. This movie is pretty slow, but that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable. It features the best actor to play Bond (Sean Connery), the usual beautiful women, an interesting villan, fantastic set design from Ken Adams, etc... However, the one liners aren't quite there, the girl really does nothing except provide scenery and the movie doesn't really build up much suspense.One other problem I had with the movie was the soundtrack. I have the DVD, but unfortunately it seemed to vary considerably. The volume of the voices would often be very soft and then there would be a ridiculously loud explosion.Anyway, this film is certainly a classic and it's well worth watching if you're a fan of the series.7/10",Dr. No
312,Freedomisanillusion,One of the best,8,23 April 2003,"It is an often held opinion that Sean Connery has been the best James Bond, and although I am inclined to disagree, this could be proof enough. Dr. No is my second favourite Bond film (beaten by a tie of Goldeneye and From Russia With Love)and it has good reason to be. Dr. No was more character oriented and had less of the trademark one-liners, and it gives a different feeling to it. Not to mention the acting is good, although we are missing Q, one of my favourite Characters. Connery is great, as is Ursula Andress, and the plot is good (I've read the book, and the bit with the squid should have been put in the film) Dr. No gets a rating of 8/10 from me.",Dr. No

314,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,Great start for a legend (SPOILERS),9,16 August 2004,"The year is 1962. Relations between the US and Cuba are heating up, the Cold War rages on, and the first James Bond movie, ""Dr. No"", is released. More than 40 years after it's original run, the film has no doubt become a bit ""dated"", but the raw elements of making a film, a Bond film to boot, are still present, and in that sense, it still entertains. Sure, the Bond myth has been sprinkled with more colorful and ambitious outings, the pacing is a bit slow, and the movie's light on action, but the low key nature of the plot lift it above most other films in the series.The movie was not easy to get off the ground. Ian Fleming's creation was original supposed to appear a few years before, in ""Thunderball"" (which would later become a novel), but the project never went through. With ""Dr. No"", Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli and Harry Salzman bring 007 to life with Sean Connery in the main role. The casting proved to be inspired, as Sir Sean would star in 5 popular ""official"" films and an ""unofficial"" one.What's interesting to know is that the film was made with only a million dollars, and even with inflation being taken into effect, that's not a budget one associates with Bond. Because of this, the plot, which follows Fleming's outline of a mad Chinese-German scientist disturbing US rocket signals, is fairly realistic and simple. After an MI6 agent is murdered in Jamaica, Bond is sent in to investigate. Once there, he encounters evil villains, reliable allies, and has to stop a deadly threat.The way in which all this unravels as Bond pokes around for clues is similar to a detective mystery, while not terribly original, is unique for a Bond film for anyone watching today. This can be contributed to the screenplay, which is more intelligent and restrained than later outings. The tension rises until it all climaxes in a great finale as the mystery is finally resolved and the mysterious Dr. No is revealed.Now on to the characters, who are vividly drawn and memorable. Joseph Wiseman creates the blueprint for the Bond villain and is suitably creepy, but never overdoes it. Even with only about 15-20 minutes of screen time, we learn everything we want to about this diabolical man. Jack Lord and John Kitzmiller stand out as above par allies to Bond. Lord, especially, has great chemistry with Connery and gives in the best Felix Leiter performance.Another great addition to the cast is Proffesor Dent, who, as the first on-screen henchman, is calculating and hateful. He's a despicable character, and when he gets his cold-blooded comeuppance, the audience is shocked, but strangely grateful. This scene sums up what the entire film is: something that won't and can't be done again with the same roughness. Then there's of course Honey Ryder, who makes an introduction that seals her in the Bond Girl Hall Of Fame. And while she isn't a ""Bond equal"" or any of that nonsense, she isn't a bimbo and is pretty strong willed.On to the star, Connery, who while a little rough around the edges, gives a tougher and more convincing spark to Bond that sadly disappears as the years wear on, even though the humor is still there. However, there is some theatrical-style acting from a few supporting players (being made in the '60's and all), but it doesn't affect the main storyline, which, as I mentioned, is a bit slow, even considering that this is one of the shorter films.But the movie has a great style, thanks to director Terrence Young, who makes every scene seem important and there are some inventive takes on the mystery thriller that immediately puts the movie (and the rest of the series) into it's own genre. So because of all this, ""Dr. No"" is not just a classic Bond film, but a classic film period. 9/10",Dr. No
315,kzintichmee,"Dr. Who? No. No? Yes, that's right. Now I'm confused.",10,4 September 2007,"Wow, the first James Bond movie! I got the super-duper deluxe version, (dvd,natch) and it looked and sounded great! I had just seen Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, so it was fun comparing the two. Both movies are excellent in different ways. I was nine when Dr. No came out. I didn't see it until years later. A funny thing about all of the 007 films, I can just watch 'em over and over again. Sean Connery is at his hat wearin', cigarette smokin', ass kickin', babe smoochin' best. I had heard that even then he was wearing a toupee but I swear, his hair looks like the real thing. That sucker must have been held on with super glue or what ever they had back then. Everybody makes a big deal about Honey Ryder, and she is hot but for my money, the double dealing half Chinese chick is hot, hot, hot. How come she didn't become a super star? Same thing with the belly dancer in From Russia with Love, fantastic looking babe. No lines but she was shaking like a Mexican Space Shuttle and that face, it haunts me still. The plot, of course, is the now old, power mad evil genius wants to rule the world and Joseph Wiseman is sinister as hell as the titular Dr. If you haven't seen any James Bond movies, this is the place to start.

Sean Connery is the definition of the cocky, almost sleazy agent with a license to kill. Set entirely in Jamaica, it feels like the point of the film is to highlight how many women Bond can sleep with in record time. Consent is an issue of the future, or at least no issue to the screenwriter, because every woman immediately falls for his wiles.

317,asdodge,A good introduction to James Bond,9,12 December 2008,"Dr. No begins the entire James Bond film saga, and yet barely fits any of the pre-conceived ideas of what a Bond Film is. What it does do is introduce the public to the basic tenets of who James Bond is and what he does and it does this very well.We meet Bond playing his card game of choice (Chemin de Feur, a form of Bacarat) and as suave and confident as he will ever be. It is also in this first movie (though the book was much later in the Bond series) that Bond is assigned the Walther PPK from Q Branch by orders of M.Bond is asked to investigate some problems in the Caribbean by the US (someone is messing with radar transmissions of US rockets in Florida) after a British agent in the area is killed. The investigations hint at a mysterious Dr. No (played brilliantly by Richard Wiseman) who owns a small island off the coast of Jamaica.What is so great about this movie is that, though a Bond movie, it lacks many of the silly contrivances of the ""Bond Formula"" which would be introduced piecemeal through later films. Bond is a detective... an agent... not some super-human hero who can pull down evil empires with a button on his magic watch. He's cool, calculating, and even cold-blooded when he guns down a potential assassin who he has already disarmed (though, the scene inferred here has 2 filmed versions- one in which the assailant reacquires his gun- albeit it, with an empty chamber...) The interplay between Bond and Moneypenny are here from the get-go, as is the irascibility of M towards Bond (which Dame Judi Dench has brought back brilliantly in the Brosnan-Craig Bonds).What's missing are the famous pre-titles sequences, although Maurice Binder's famous titles get a subtler beginning here (before they became the nude extravaganzas in later years). The requisite big-budget chase scenes are not here (though a car chase is offered), nor are the multi-continent gorgeous locales here... everything occurs in or near Jamaica.The most famous element of Bond movies (outside of Bond) are the famous ""Bond Girls."" Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench comes first, then, the iconic and legendary scene- Ursula Andress (as Honey Rider). SPECTRE, the infamous crime organization, is also mentioned in this movie.Again, this movie is not unlike many detective/spy movies of its era- it is the name ""Bond"" that makes it stand out. The fame that the Bond series later achieved was not here- the movie is solid and enjoyable but not ""Casablanca"" quality good. It is a 9/10 for Bond films because it is done well, fairly faithful to the book, and did not hide behind gadgets and gimmicks as later Bonds do. Bond here is an agent, who must be detective, lawman, and killer all rolled into one- and it does it well.All in all, a fine movie, made on a shoe-string budget that accomplishes what it was meant to do- ably and properly introduce James Bond to an international audience.",Dr. No

The film set the standards for many movies to come, and the Bond universe has been parodied so many times over the years since! The film was based on one of the bestselling James Bond novels of the same name by Ian Fleming. There were so many people that contributed, to makes this film so memorable: Ian Fleming's excellent novels, Sean Connery's brilliant portrayal of James Bond, the stylish and tireless direction by Terence Young, John Barry's brilliant theme tune, Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood's fantastic script, Maurice Binder's brilliant main title opening, Peter Hunt's rapid and professional editing, etc. It's just all so brilliant! Connery as James Bond was able to charm both critics and moviegoers from the premiere, and it became an instant hit! The story centers around this British agent for MI6 names James Bond (codenamed 007), who is sent to Jamaica to investigate the mystical disappearance of another British agent named Strangways and his assistant. Bond is almost immediately tried to get rid off, and Bond is quickly lured into a darker and more sinister plot! The plot is in fact very simple, though it gets kinda complicated at the end! Terence Young's brilliant direction is clearly visible right at the start! I don't think any other Bond director (expect Guy Hamilton with Goldfinger) has achieved to make such a sleek and stylish movie which matches Sean Connery's portrayal so far! Sean Connery is imo the best Bond ever! He was the first and the original of course, but his performance is just so stylish and so memorable that whenever you think of Bond, you'll think of Connery! He expertly and smoothly blends into the role of James Bond, like he has been playing the character for years. It's interesting to note, that Connery drew a lot of inspiration for his interpretation of Bond from Terrence Young! And that Young apparently had Sean Connery sleep in the special tailored suit he wears in the movie. Connery agreed, and when he woke up the suit was still as comfortable as the night before! Connery owns the role, and will for many be the first and best James Bond, including me! Ursulla Andress plays the first EON Bond girl, and boy does she look good in a white bikini, phew! She's never been my absolute favorite Bond girl, but if I were to make a top 10 she'd probably be nr. 3 or something. She isn't given much screen time, but when she makes her entrance... it was worth the wait! She gets the most iconic Bond girl intro, when she walks out of the sea with her white bikini! Andress isn't that good an actress, but considering she's got no prior acting experience, she does a decent job. Joseph Wiseman plays the first EON Bond villain. I've always liked this villain. He has a nice build up, he has a nice, calm and laid back performance, which is a lot of fun to watch! He kinda set the standards for all Bond villains to come... Too bad he doesn't get much screen time, neither. He is also the first to introduce us to SPECTRE! You'll hear more about them in the other movies! He'd probably be my nr. 6 or something, on my top 10! We also have Jack Lord as Felix Leiter! Lord delivers the definitive performance as Felix Leiter. He's sophisticated, suave and calm in all of his scenes, and seems like a capable agent in his own right! More than you could say about the other actors to portray Leiter! Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell takes on the roles of M and Moneypenny, and both does a fantastic job!Dr. No was never one of my absolute favorites. Don't get me wrong it is one of my favorites, but not one of my absolute favorites. I would have liked Andress and Wiseman to have more screen time, so that they could do more with their characters. The film hasn't got any real memorable action set pieces. The ""action"" consists of a regular car chase, people trying to shoot Bond while he sleeps, and some brawls in the end. That's kinda' it. Some might argue that this movie is boring. That is completely nonsense. The films pacing is slow, but this movie is meant to introduce viewers to Bond. Who he is, how he operates, who he works for, how he lives etc. The film does a pretty damn good job with that!I guess, I have been pretty unfair with my verdict. It is the first Bond movie and therefore it is almost to important to rate! But here it is. Forget whatever critic I might have had against this movie, and watch it! Probability says you're gonna like it, and wanna go check the other Bond movies out! This is the first real James Bond movie... and it's absolutely friggin' awesome!9/10",Dr. No

So I decided yesterday to watch it again, 9 years later.Lots of things were different back in the 60's with the Bond movies. The only ""special"" thing that Q brings Bond is a Walther PPK Pistol, to replace his Beretta. The movie is also a lot more intelligent when it comes to old-fashioned spy methology.""Who is the best Bond?"" is a question often stated by fans of the James Bond movies. Many like Sean Connery (starring in this film) best, but I prefer Roger Moore even if his sense of humour sometimes spoils the action totally. ""Moonraker"" is in my opinion the best Bond movie of them all, but after having watched this one again, I think ""Dr. No"" has reached third place, right below ""The Living Daylights""! 8 out of 10.",Dr. No

The job will take him through Jamaica and it's islands.The movie is very well done for its time but time has passed and it hasn't done justice to the movie. There will be some who thinks that this is a boring movie, but Dr. No is a spy movie and it's well done.The scenery is magnificent, composer is one of a kind and the acting is well done. The movie plot is old-school and most of the plot twist, you can spot them miles away.All and all the movie is very good and it's the first time we get to see Bond... James Bond.",Dr. No
321,Nic673,Defintely one of the best in the series,10,7 September 1999,"Dt. No has something just about all of the Bond films are lacking. A spirit of originality! This is by far the best Bond movie. It is the only spy-thriller in the series, because From Russia with Love was more of an action movie.The storyline is awesome and very interesting unlike most Bond movies, even of today. The acting and directing is great. Bond wouldn`t return in this type of form until License to Kill. One of my favorite movies and without doubt my favorite in the series along with just From Russia with Love, Licence to Kill, For Your Eyes Only, and The Man with the Golden Gun, but after those titles personally every other film of the series is lacklustering and very overdone.",Dr. No
322,Nic673,Clearly the best toward novels,10,6 September 1999,"Most people consider that consider themselves as Bond fan, probably don't even know who is Ian Fleming. In most of the Bond movies, Bond is a chauvinistical superhuman who never finds himself in failure or not losing in kind of matter at all. We've giving more a rip-off of Fleming's character than a portrayal. Dr. No is partially defintive of Fleming's character. This movie is low action, gagdets, and humor. This is why Dr. No is not consider to be the best of the series. Come on people, it's 1962; you can just come out of nowhere and make an action movie. All of Fleming's novels are not as ridiculous as the movies as such installments as Thunderball, The Spy Who Loved Me, Goldeneye, and Moonraker. Some of the audience of today, prefer movie to be fast paced action movies meaning less story line. Dr. No is probably on my favorites of all time. I liked Goldfinger as movie, but not as Bond adaptation(Because seems more of a parody than a creation of art). This movie has more value behind than just being first Bond movie. It has good production value and probably one of the best storylines of the franchise. This film is more of a spy-thriller than an stupid bland action movie. I don't think Fleming intended his character to be a superhuman in a stupid and over budget production. Bond is always sent on his mission to stop some megalomaniac who has no motive to just destroy the world for not even a stupid reason. This series has some lamest and most cornest lines in cinematic histroy with some exception. Dr. No isn't like any of the later movies its very low-key and Bond isn't wise cracking immortal being lifeless robot who become later. The acting is better than most the installments  I've seen. I don't think this is better than From Russia with Love. Dr. No will probably always be one of my favorite movies. Yes, hate most action movies except for the pre-genre types who sort of made the action genre(Clint Eastwood, Bruce Lee, and maybe Sean Connery), because their  as good as anybody is today. Plus, I think Pierce Bronsnan is worst James Bond, and I can see why probably. Dr. No is in my opinion the best Bond movie in a tie with From Russia with Love.",Dr. No
323,Lori_ruelo,The Beginning of a Legend!,8,2 July 2018,"When 1962 the first James Bond film came on the big screen, no one had expected the success of the legendary agent to survive for so many years. 
I also have to admit that this agent is my favorite hero. He is always on the move, visits different parts of the world, always has the most beautiful women around him and can kick the villains in the ass. 
The start of this legend is captured Famos by Oscar winner Sean Connery. A smart guy with a lot of British charm (though Connery is Scot), always looks elegant, is very world-class and can radiate masculine hardness in serious situations. Certainly it is also a male worldview of men in the early 60s, but Connery hits the nail on the head.
Of course, there is no such thing as the sensual Playmate of James Bond: Ursula Andress! How it rises from the sea is simply stunning! (not only because I'm also a Swiss). But it adorns the typical Bondgirl of the Connery era: beautiful and vulnerable. But can be very tough in difficult moments.
Joseph Wiseman mimes the first Bond villain Dr. No. With his elegant and dry way, he wants to subjugate the nations of the Earth. Certainly he is also only a chess figure, but can already offer Bond's forehead. Dr. No is dry, devilish and deadly and always with a goal in front of the eyes: World domination!
Certainly, the first Bond adventure is still timidly implemented. The action and the effects are cheap. But it sets the genre or franchise the stamp on how the adventure of the British agent should go on. 
Conclusion: A successful start that still plays with the handbrake. There is still a need to improve. But I certainly have no doubts about James Bond 007!",Dr. No
324,ianbrown65,"""It depends on what side of the mirror you're on, Mr Bond.""",8,19 January 2015,"Sean Connery is just a little stiff and the plot does rather thin out towards the end, but for a film made over 50 years ago this first James Bond thriller dates remarkably well. Joseph Wiseman was the baddie with the metal hands and metallic voice, while bikini-clad Ursula Andress wades languidly out of a turquoise ocean in one of cinema's most famous entrances.Right from the start you know it's something different. The multi-coloured computer-dots of the title-sequence dissolve into writhing calypso dancers, suggesting an espionage thriller with a science-fiction lining. It's London premiere was the same month (October) as the Cuban Missile Crisis. There's the pastel colours of the decontamination chamber (with its the sexual undercurrent as the naked Connery and Andress are forced through it) and the luxury bedrooms, contrasted with the harsh swamp where they are captured, sealed off by the clamp of metal doors. Then there's the weird gushing echoes on the soundtrack as Connery edges along the circular ventilation shaft with its surreal sexual symbolism, and the sense of sterile super-technology seen later in the reactor set.Dr No set the scene for all the Bonds which have followed. The exotic locations, the impossible plots, the megalomaniacal villains, and, of course, the alluring heroines. An instant success, in the UK at least where it was top British money-maker at the box-office that year despite opening in mid-autumn, it would still be coining it in, double-billed with other Bonds, a decade later.Plenty of fans prefer the gaucheness of Dr No to the slickness of the later, more inflated Bonds. There's a fresh feel to Bond and to the action, of Eon Films capitalising on the uncertainty of a new star and formula. The early Bonds had yet to become parodies of themselves. Bond here is still recognisably human (he is distinctly nauseous after killing tarantula). Contrast his basic precautions against intruders (a strand of hair, talcum powder) to the later technological gimmicks. And the location work in Jamaica and the glistening Caribbean is vivid.Dr No, meanwhile, is the least seen of Bond villains. Wiseman's intense performance is so seemingly impassive even his rage seems measured.It's not quite the best Bond film. Connery escapes rather too easily from his prison cell, while not enough is made of the climatic fight, there's no bravura editing by Peter Hunt. Monty Norman's music is too Dick Barton-ish (one particularly pedestrian passage is used again in the helicopter chase in From Russia with Love). John Barry would have made more of the beach encounter between Connery and Andress, and highlighted more subtly the menaces within Dr No's lair. And there's no interesting subsidiary villains, certainly not Professor Dent (later Bonds might have made something of the 'three blind mice' assassins).Dated only by the 'space age' costumes, trouser turn-ups, and dark red lipsticks, Dr No acts as a very effective overture for the subsequent series.",Dr. No
325,Jared G.,The one that started it all,8,8 September 1999,"Dr. No isn't one of the best Bond films. The plot's a bit slow and simplistic and there are no good henchmen. However, it DOES have one of the best Bond girls and, in my opinion, one of the best Bond villains. Joseph Wiseman does a terrific job playing the cold, emotionless Dr. No. The character is much more intimidating than some of the later villains in the series for all their bluster.  For Wiseman alone I will watch this movie anytime.",Dr. No
326,Jim-499,Realistic,10,16 December 2001,"This is my second favorite Bond movie of all time, right after Goldfinger (1964).  This is because, to me, it is the most realistic SPY movie of all the Bond movies.  My thoughts when viewing this movie tonight at a local movie theatre that show old movies was, this must be what it is REALLY like working in the intelligence and spy world, at least in 1962.  Here we see Bond relying on his experience and intelligence more than gadgets, outsmarting his adversaries on several occasions.  I'd much prefer a movie like Doctor No to the new Brosnan movies where there are unrealistic gadgets and actions scenes just for the sake of action.",Dr. No
327,mcfische,Decent introduction to a great series,6,25 July 2003,"Compared with other Bond films, Dr. No-the film that introduced 007 to the world-can be rather dull. Even so, it is a decent film to watch.There isn't much I can comment about this other then point out my likes and dislikes. The film doesn't leave me with as many opinions as some of the finer Bond films. First off, my likes. The dramatic introduction to 007 with the famous ""Bond...James Bond"" is a wonderful introduction to one of the best action heroes in movies. Sean Connery isn't as good as Brosnan or Lazenby, but he's a good actor. The film also has one of the best villains; Dr. No, a top SPECTRE agent. He has spies around every corner in this film. He seems calmer and much more organized then other Bond villains. This film has 007 entirely relying on his intellect and luck. No Q Branch gadgetry. All he gets in this film is his signature handgun, the Walther PPK. The CIA agent Quarrel was a good character. And we're introduced to several key Bond allies; Felix Letier, M, and Miss Moneypenny.Dislikes; four Bond girls for me is too many. Many of them have no real characterization or use in the story; they're just there. Bond wins the two good ones over too easily. Ursula Andress as Honey Rider is a good actress, but with hardly anything to do but stand and look pretty in one scene and be helpless the next. Peter Burton is not good at Q. His performance was flat-out boring. How is destroying the US Space Program world domination? They present Bond doing that so frequently that you think he's doing it in every film, where in this one, although Dr. No is working for Blofeld's goal of world domination, he is not directly trying to gain it.Dislikes aside, this was a pretty decent Bond film. I'm watching them in order, and I can't wait to see From Russia With Love, where Q is REALLY introduced.",Dr. No
328,vgamerdc,Dr. No (1962) Review,7,21 December 2013,"Dr. No is the very FIRST James Bond film in the series and kicks it off with an AMAZING start.The film stars the fantastic Sean Connery, as well as the beautiful Ursula Andrews. In this film Bond must investigate the disappearance of one of his missing colleagues in Jamaica.Now the color in the film was just SPECTACULAR! The film came out in 1962, and the enhancements made it look just wonderful. There were one or two rough cuts were a few frames were dropped but overall this re-enhancement was great.I give this movie a 7.5 out of 10. It was the first James Bond so MGM didn't quite know what they were getting into — they didn't have the same kind of intro like Bond is well known for — and the story is good enough. I enjoyed the film and it is a classic. Definitely worth a watch.",Dr. No
329,arbarnes,"""That's a Smith & Wesson, and you've had your six.""",7,9 April 2009,"Well, I just caught the digital restoration of this first, classic Bond film, and it is like seeing it for the first time -which it most definitely is not! The first time was on a black and white television screen when I was a child -but it made an indelible impression even then, and images from the film have been part of my ""movie-memory"" ever since -as I am sure they have been for many other people. This is, of course, the alpha-movie of Bond stories, where just about everything that came afterwards has its roots: the coolness, the impossibly grand sets, the villain, the pretty girl, the exotic locations, the high style, the chase, and the screen character of Bond himself, brilliantly portrayed by Connery. Though it is not the best Bond film, being the first gives it the right to be on any required viewing list. It has a relatively simple story, but it moves along with such an interesting and (for the time) fresh, dynamic style, that you really don't think much about plot or story. You just enjoy. And there is much to enjoy. Marvel at the fantastic, imaginative sets by Ken Adam, the truly weird and underrated Joseph Wiseman as Dr.No, the beauty of Ursula Andress rising from the sea and witness the birth of screen legend in countless iconic images. In the centre is Sean Connery - and what an entrance! He dominates the film with a raw coolness that is particularly striking in the interior scenes. In the scenes on location he is at times quite uneven in his performance -seemingly unsure of his characterization at times. But I am really splitting hairs here -it comes from having seen the film so many times; his contribution to screen iconography is enormous, and the Bond films would never have been as successful an adventure without him.",Dr. No

332,dmbjam29,"Bond, James Bond.",8,17 April 2007,"It was 45 years ago when James Bond made his cinematic debut with ""Dr. No."" Since then the franchise has gone through ups and down, face-lifts and tuning but in that one film in 1962 everything we know about Bond was born and perfect.The movie is actually not the first story of the Ian Fleming series, that's 'Casino Royale,' but it is a great cinematic start to the franchise. In the story, Bond jets off to Jamaica to discover the murder of a fellow agent and once he gets there he realizes he's into more than he knows. Sean Connery's performance in this film is legendary. All his movements and lines are magnetic, he literally carries the movie through its entirety. The larger than life mise-en-scene throughout the whole movie is excellent. The gorgeous women, the exotic locations, the high-octane espionage and the diabolical villain with a humongous lair. These are the recipes that are synonymous with Bond.However, despite all its extraordinary features, I do not believe ""Dr. No"" is the best Bond film. I think the plot and pace at times seem too slow, especially when arriving to Crab Key. And also the ending is rather slap-dash and anti-climatic in my opinion. They didn't have the crescendo that 'From Russia With Love' or 'Goldfinger' had at their conclusions.But this film is a cinematic masterpiece, it helped defined the blockbuster action genre. 45 years after its release the greatness of this movie is still recognized, as it will be even 45 years from now.8 out of 10.",Dr. No

Also, his sidekick Quarrel is a tiresome Jamaican stereotype, played as best as possible by John Kitzmiller. The film only really kicks into gear in the last third, when Bond and the girl (Ursula Andress providing nothing more than eye candy) enter the lair of the titular villain. The strange angles and over the top mechanisms are a welcome taster of what would later appear in the series thanks to the brilliant production designer Ken Adam, and Joseph Wiseman is sinister as No. Don't expect the wild adventure of The Spy who Loved Me, but it is better than Ian Fleming's original novel, and worth watching if you're a budding Bond fanatic.",Dr. No

Sean Connery is the ultimate Bond.  The virility he carries to the role is awesome.  Ursula Andress is still the best Bond girl after all these years.  The scene where she comes out of the water is a classic.The movie is filled with likable characters (Felix Leiter, Quarrel), enjoyable action sequences, and a great bad guy.

336,kenobi7,James Bond makes his first film appearance...ever!,10,9 March 2013,"Having never seen any Bond films outside of the newer releases starring Daniel Craig, I figured I should start off my introduction into classic Bond the right way. The film proved to be immensely entertaining. While this was Connery's first time as Bond, he plays the role so well that you would never know it otherwise. He captures Bond's personality perfectly. Craig plays the character in a more aggressive way, but both he and Connery play up the suave, gentler (and much more humorous) side of Bond to a great extent as well. The action, production design, costumes, and props are all excellent. Connery was cracking me up the entire movie with his one-liners and his cockiness. Just like Craig does in the role, he may act like he truly cares, but he's usually stringing whoever it is along as a means to an end. And that's what is so great about the character - you truly do not know what he is going to do next. I would have preferred it if the villainous Dr. No would have appeared earlier in the movie so he could establish more of a presence, but that really was the only drawback for me. Everything else considering, it was an absolutely stellar film, and a great Bond film (especially since it was the first). I may be rather late to the game of seeing the Bond films with Connery, but I'm definitely down with watching the other films in the future.",Dr. No
337,namideo,For the first time!,8,31 January 2009,"We hear strange radio-like sounds as a white dot makes it's way across a black screen. The dot opens up into the barrel of a gun as we see a man step into the frame. All goes silent. He turns, SHOOTS! The gun echos, and an explosion of the theme music to what would be the longest running film series ever, plays for the first time to our ears. What a perfect way to kick off the canon! The story follows James Bond 007 as he is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow agent and meanwhile get to the bottom of a radio interference that has been toppling the United States' guided missile program. Bond's investigation takes him to the hazardous island of Crab Key, in the Caribbean, where the mysterious and deranged scientist, Doctor No awaits 007 and his companions.One of the things that's great about Dr. No is simply the fact that it is the first James Bond film. Good or bad it's worth it just for the sake of going back and seeing where it all stated. A piece of movie history. And it still delivers just about everything you would expect in a Bond film, even by today's standards. We get a mystery to solve. We get girls, locations, gadgets (though, simple), car chases, explosions, fights, rescues, escapes, romance. It's all there! A very young Sean Connery is excellent in his debut as the super spy. Still to this day, I can hardly think of another actor who combines wit, toughness, and elegance the way Mister Connery does. He's truly a winner for the role. Ursula Andress is as beautiful as Venus herself as the bikini, Tarzan-girl, Honey Rider. And Joseph Wiseman gives us a very creepy and stoic performance as the diabolical Dr. No. Every aspect of this film is worth mentioning...the directing, the main title design, the musical score, the extremely lavish and stylized sets, and even the aggressiveness of the story, which is much more harsh than other detective films at the time, with its ruthless hero and villains and explosive action scenes.It's definitely the most low key of the Bond canon. The series was still in a sort of evolutionary state and wouldn't be completely on its feet until at least the subsequent film. One can also get a sense for how low budget this first film was, as many of the sets and Bond hardware is very minimalistic. And I'm not sure that some of the scenes and plot devices completely work, if examined thoroughly. But these are rather minor gripes.It's an excellent start for the series, when it was still in its ""golden age.""

His delivery of ""Bond, James Bond"" made that simple quote into one of the famous movie quotes ever.  (It was not in the books before that.) I consider the opening gun barrel sequence to be the best of all Bond films, and Dr No, one of the best villains.  9 out of 10 from me.",Dr. No
339,Orpington,"Good, solid start to the series",7,9 July 2003,"It may be over forty years old, but the first Bond film still holds up well today, thanks to great Caribbean locations, tight direction and scripting and an assured debut performance as Bond from Sean Connery, who looks at home in the part from the beginning. Compared to many later Bond films, Dr No is lacking in big action set pieces, and there is no hi-tech gadgetry in sight. However, this brings the film much closer to the spirit of Fleming than many of its successors, and allows Bond to actually do some espionage work, bringing a welcome flavour of realism to the proceedings. Bond in this film is not a quipping, invincible superhero, but a human being prepared to become a ruthless killer when required, and capable of being scared, as is plainly demonstrated when he finds a nasty-looking spider on his bed. This is a Bond who can also get beaten up, and look the worse for wear afterwards, not a common feature of most Bond films.Having said that, many of the soon-to-be familiar elements of the Bond franchise do make their debut in Dr No, such as Bernard Lee's irascible M, Lois Maxwell's Miss Moneypenny, and Bond's CIA ally, Felix Leiter, well played here by Jack Lord. Q also puts in an appearance, but in this film he is played by Peter Burton rather than Desmond Llewellyn, and all he gives Bond is a Walther PPK. Dr No himself is the first in a long line of supervillains with some kind of physical abnormality and an impressive HQ, but he is well played by Joseph Wiseman and his scheme for knocking over NASA rockets is not as OTT as some of the fiendish plots of later films. The other big element present from the start is, of course, the Bond girl. There are some very good ones in this film, especially the lovely Ursula Andress, who remains one of the most iconic of Bond girls, even if she doesn't do very much after coming out of the sea.It is not the greatest Bond film, but Dr No remains an impressive start to the series, setting much of the tone for the franchise while treating Bond more seriously than would often be the case in later films. 7/10",Dr. No

Terrance Young, who is the best thing to have happened to Bond alongside Martin Campbell, was a great director who truly understood the appeal of the character. It is no surprise that the Sean Connery's three best performances as 007 are under his direction and many of the cast and crew have been quoted as saying that Terrance WAS James Bond in attitude and appearance.Connery completely inhabits the role and is a commanding screen presence. His introduction has to be one of the coolest and most memorable of a movie character, long before ""Bond, James Bond"" became a catchphrase it was just a really cool line.Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder has possibly the most iconic scene of the film as she steps out of the ocean in a white bikini and she is surely a stunning beauty. Besides that, she isn't too memorable but she does what is required of her. The supporting part which really stands out is Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent. He has a unique look and style and makes the most out of what on paper is not that great of a role. He would later return to the franchise in both From Russia With Love and Thunderball as the faceless Blofeld (the voice was dubbed however). Felix Leiter pops up in this first instalment and is played by Jack Lord. It is another great character performance and was the only time in the series up until Live And Let Die that Leiter was 007's equal and not just an incompetent sidekick.The setting is fantastic. Ted Moore's photography makes Jamaica look absolutely beautiful and Ken Adams' production design so impressed Stanley Kubrick that he hired him for his next film, Dr Strangelove. John Barry's score is great but of course most of the accolades must go to Monty Norman for creating the iconic Bond theme. Again, try to forget how over-used and spoofed this has become and revel in its utter coolness. Having said that, it is somewhat over used in THIS film, it plays in the back of scenes where it seemingly has no place and can sometimes be distracting. This is one of the very few missteps director Young takes. The opening titles by Maurice Binder are an awesome bit of pop art, I was shocked to find that these titles were created by the same man who did the ones in later films as they are akin to something you would expect from Saul Bass rather than the bloke who garishly projected neon lights onto women's bodies in later years.After the silliness of Brosnan's tenure as Bond it was refreshing to see Daniel Craig's somewhat brutal take on the character but far too many people think Craig was the first to give Bond a cold blooded streak. All the actors who have portrayed him, even Roger Moore, managed to inject a sense of heartlessness into the character but Connery has probably the best (and coolest) moment right in this, his very first performance. After a would be assassin has spent all his ammo and then tries for another shot at point blank range, Bond quips ""That's a Smith & Wesson, and you've had your six"" before coldly firing 2 shots into the defenceless man. Rumour has it censors trimmed out Bond pumping a few more rounds into the guy as he lies on the floor already dead.There is an excellent 3 act structure employed in Dr. No which was copied many times in the sequels but never quite done as well. As Bond makes his way through the film, discovering the truth and getting closer to the bad guy we really get a feel of him being drawn into the villain's world deeper and deeper until he ends up in the heart of the villain's lair. It has an almost 'Alice going further into the rabbit hole' feeling. The only real nitpick I have with the film is that the villain's lair ultimately looks a bit like a naff 60' Bond villain's lair but that is hardly surprising given the circumstances! Watch Dr. No back to back with From Russia With Love and remember how good Bond could be before he started relying on gadgets and gimmicks. There are many later films, Live And Let Die, Goldeneye, The Living Daylights and Casino Royale to name a few which are as good as Dr. No but none of them have the fresh, innocent feeling that this film has, before 007 films became a brand and producers started trying to cater to what they thought an audience wanted.",Dr. No
343,josephkinion,First Bond film for sean connery as James Bond,10,3 May 2019,"In Jamaica British Agent John Strangways is murdered by assailants masquerading as blind beggars. MI6 orders James Bond to investigate his disappearance which may be connected with some recent problems the CIA and NASA have been having with a moon rocket. When Bond arrives, he finds a chauffeur waiting for him, claiming to have been sent by the embassy, but a call to the embassy reveals that they did not send a driver. Bond turns the tables on the imposter but the man breaks a cyanide cigarette before Bond can interrogate him. Knowing that something must be afoot, Bond meets Quarrel, a local man Strangways hired to take him to Crab King, a local private island. Quarrel pulls a knife on Bond, and a Felix Leiter backs him up with a gun, before they realize they are MI6 and CIA working for the same goal. The men shake hands and make up.
Bond asks the local geologist R. J. Dent some questions and finds out that he is lying about the radioactivity of rocks that Strangways had asked him to test. Dent is worried by Bond's presence and is given orders to kill the British agent. When Dent later shoots a decoy body, Bond knows he must go to Crab Key, and kills Dent.Honey Ryder emerges from the sea.
On Crab Key, Bond meets the beautiful Honey Ryder as she collects shells. A security team destroys their escape, so they head inland for safety. Bond insists they follow ""dragon"" tracks which lead them to a tank with a flamethrower. Quarrel is murdered by the tank, but Bond and Honey are taken to a compound. Inside, they are decontaminated and treated to a luxurious room. They meet Dr. Julius No, owner of the facility. Bond calls him out, knowing that he has intentions for his nuclear program other than powering his island facility. Dr. No reveals his organization as SPECTRE and tries to recruit Bond, who declines.Bond is thrown in a cell but escapes by crawling through steam vents. He knocks out a henchman, dons a radiation suit and enters Dr. No's control room where they are running a test for the takeover of the Cape Canaveral rocket. Disguised, Bond manages to climb up to a control platform where he hijacks the controls, sending the nuclear reactor into a meltdown. Dr. No tries to fight him, but due to his metal hands he is unable to climb out of a cage descending into the water casing the reactor, and perishes. Bond rescues Honey and the two escape the island in a boat. They kiss in the boat after it runs out of fuel.At a country club in Jamaica, undercover British agent John Strangways plays cards with R. J. Dent and others. He leaves the club and is shot down by The Three Blind Mice: three assassins pretending to be blind beggars. His body is thrown inside a getaway car and rushed off. At Strangways' office, his secretary is murdered while making a call to headquarters. The Three Blind Mice steal two files labeled ""Crab Key"" and ""Doctor No"". On the other end, the radio receiver notifies his superior that there is a situation.
In London, James Bond is playing baccarat at an upscale casino with several people and Sylvia Trench. The two flirt, but Bond receives a note and excuses himself from the game. Sylvia follows him, and he invites her to lunch the next day. Bond then travels to the office of Universal Exports, a cover for the British Intelligence office of MI6. There, he is informed by M that he must travel to Jamaica to investigate Strangways' disappearance, which may have something to do with some problems the Americans have been having with their Space Shuttle launches. He is given a new Walther PPK by Q.He returns home to find Sylvia playing golf in his room, wearing only his shirt. The two spend a quick amount of time together before Bond catches a flight to Kingston, Jamaica. At the airport, a mysterious man watches Bond arrive, and a photographer tries to snap his photo. He is greeted by a driver outside, but calls MI6 first to check in. He asks if the driver was sent and he learns that no driver was sent. He rides with the driver nonetheless. As the driver tries to evade the man from the airport, Bond pulls a gun on him and interrogates him on the side of the road. After taking some punches, the driver weeps and asks to be allowed a cigarette. He bites into the cigarette from his pocket and dies instantly.
At the government house, they discover it was cyanide inside his cigarette. Bond meets with Pleydell Smith to discuss Strangways, and learns that Dent was one of the last to see Strangways. They visit Strangways' office where Bond discovers a receipt from Dent's practice. He also discovers a photo of a fisherman and Strangways and notes that the fisherman was driving the car that was tailing him from the airport. At his hotel room, Bond sets up traps to see if people have entered his room, and heads off to meet Dent and the other card players. They inform him that Strangways had been chartering a fisherman named Quarrel's boat frequently.Bond visits Quarrell at his boat, but receives no answers. He follows him to Puss Feller's restaurant and is assaulted by the the fisherman and Puss Feller but gets the upper-hand in the fight quickly. A man orders Bond to ""hold it"", and shortly reveals himself to be Felix Leiter, CIA. Quarrell greets Bond as a friend. That night at dinner, Bond and Felix talk about Strangways' disappearance and the trouble at Cape Canaveral and the photographer from the airport snaps another photo. Quarrel restrains her while Bond destroys her film. Outside the restaurant, The Three Blind Mice nearly shoot Bond but are thrown off by a passing car.
The next day, Bond visits R. J. Dent at his office and enquires about Strangways' receipt. Dent says the rocks he brought him were not special and he threw them out. Dent also claimed that the rocks were not from Crab Key, a privately owned island near Kingston. After Bond leaves Dent rushes off to a boat and argues with the driver to take him to Crab Key. On the island, he is escorted to a large empty room where he talks to a voice over an intercom. The voice is angry that he arrived during daytime and is angry that Bond is still alive, and will hold Dent responsible if Bond comes snooping around the island. Dent departs with a deadly tarantula left for him to eliminate Bond.Bond returns to his hotel room and discovers that his traps had been sprung. He goes to sleep and in the middle of the night is awoken by the spider in his bed. He kills the spider. The next day he visits Pleydell Smith again and the two discuss the investigation. Bond discovers Miss Taro listening in, but she claims she was looking for a file. Bond is later found by Quarrell measuring the radioactivity of the rocks Strangways brought to Dent with a geiger counter. Their radioactivity levels are high and Bond asks a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key that night. Quarrel believes there is a dragon on the island.
Back at his hotel room, he receives a call from Miss Taro. She invites him over, but on the way a car tries to run him off the road. He manages to escape while the other car plummets off a hill and explodes. Surprised to see him alive, Taro tries to keep him at her place until another assassin can arrive. They sleep together, and after Bond decides to go out for food. He calls for a car, but rather than a taxi arriving an officer arrives to arrest Taro. Bond waits at her apartment, and when Dent arrives and shoots a decoy, Bond interrogates him and shoots him.Bond returns to Quarrel at the dock and they boat over to Crab Key. They pull the boat up on the island and wait until daylight. The next morning Bond hears a woman singing. He sees the beautiful Honey Ryder exiting the sea carrying shells. He surprises her and asks her why she's on the island. She tells him she is not afraid of the island security, but when Quarrel warns them that a boat is coming, they hide behind a sand dune. The security team notices Bond's boat and fires around the island. They leave, claiming they will return with dogs. Bond tries to send Honey back to Kingston, but her boat was hit by the marksmen. She continues with him and Quarrel inland to a hiding spot. On the way, they are forces to hide underwater and use reeds as snorkels as a patrol with dogs approaches. The patrol leaves, but another lone guard arrives and Bond kills him. They arrive at Honey's hiding spot and agree to take turns watching out for the dragon, which Honey claims to have seen. When Quarrel sees tracks, Bond insists they follow them to the dragon. By the time they arrive to the dragon it is nighttime. They are spotted and the ""dragon"", a tank painted with teeth and a flamethrower mounted on the front, approaches them. Bond and Quarrel attempt to shoot its tires and lights, but fail. Quarrel is lit on fire and dies. Bond and Honey are apprehended and taken to a compound.Upon arrival, they are put through a decontamination process and are taken to a luxurious suite where they find clothes in their exact sizes because, as the extremely polite receptionist explains, they were expected. Bond and Honey drink coffee, still confused, and quickly pass out because the coffee was drugged. A mysterious man with black gloves enters their room as they sleep, but leaves shortly after. The next morning they dress and are escorted to the office of the compound's owner, Dr. Julius No. He arrives and introduces himself, but excuses his handicap - he has lost his hands in an accident and had replaced them with metallic ones.Dr. No invites them to lunch, where they discuss the origins of his wealth and what he is doing with his nuclear facility: No was once a treasurer for a Hong Kong crime Tong, and escaped China with approxiamtely 10 million dollars of the Tong's money. He explains that he offered his services to the West and the East but was refused by both, which prompted him to work for SPECTRE.",Dr. No
344,loopmyworld,Bond James Bond is born.,10,15 September 2010,"Dr No the first movie of the bond series. Producer Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli gives the birth to the legend 007. Resources says that 007 role was initially offered to Roger Moore but he declined due to his TV series The Saint. Sean Connery steps in for 007 makes a remarkable debut as bond. The was released in 1962 & the audience were speechless after the release of Dr No. The movie hits the best movie of that year. Everything in this movie has been worked perfectly. Director Terence Young does the remarkable job as a debutant director of 007. The movie doesn't have title track as all other bond movies had but this movie introduces the bond theme, without this piece of music no bond movie is complete which performed & written by {Monty Norman}. John barry does his job pretty well for the debut bond movie. Beautiful location, the sets of the movie.If your expecting spectacular action from this movie, than your highly mistaken, cause this movie has got some action sequences which mean a lot at that time. The role of Dr No has been played well by Joseph Wiseman. Ursula play's her role good to, Miss Trench one of the most beautiful bond girls & sexy too. This movie is a legend in its own way, the birth of 007 from Dr No & My Rating is 10/10",Dr. No
345,anders-rock,"Good actors, a few good thrills but overall unimpressive",5,6 October 2012,"The first Bond movie ever (unless you count the Casino Royale TV production) and one of the highest rated in the series celebrates it's 50 years anniversary this year and how does it hold up? I will start with the positives. Sean Connery is amazing as the suave yet tough super-agent. The best thing about his performance is how well he pulls off both the ruthless and charming side of 007. No other Bond actor did it that well in my eyes. The others leaned mostly towards one of the two sides for their portrayal but Connery finds a fine middle ground. Joseph Wiseman is also a worthy first cinematic Bond villain as the titular character. He is cool, he is creepy he oozes confidence. Nowadays he seems like a cliché but this is where the cliché started and it's not strange that people try to copy his performance. Ursula Andress is also a fine first leading lady though I'm not as much in love with her as many others. There are some nicely directed and exciting scenes such as the tarantula attack, the infamous ""You've had your six"" and Bond climbing an obstacle-filled ventilation shaft (despite that scene doesn't make much sense when you think about it). And this is where the negatives start. Most of the action scenes are pretty dated today. The figths don't really look like anyone actually gets hit and the only car chase is really short and plagued by bad back-projection. Even the climax seems rushed as hell. All it takes for Bond to save the day is to turn a steering wheel, fight the villain for 15-20 seconds and get out of there. It seems a little too easy for Bond. The pacing is also really slow by today's standards. It takes almost half an hour before the main bad guy even gets mentioned and way too much time is spent with Bond getting introduced to characters which are not really that important. Dare I say the movie is pretty boring at times. Another thing I find disappointing is the main plot. Dr No is hiding something on his island and what is he doing on this island? He jams American rockets and his next target is a rocket headed for the moon. Big deal huh? They could have spiced it up with Dr No being more insane and evil like in the book (which is superior in my opinion). While there are some bright spots in the film it never really goes as far in excitement nor entertainment as the series will later albeit not that much later.",Dr. No
346,JFHunt,"""That's a Smith & Wesson, and you've had your six.""",10,16 October 2006,"I recently embarked on a mission of my own. To watch all the Bond films in order. Believe me, it's not as easy as it sounds. Finding all of them is nearly impossible. Blockbuster's weak collection hardly does any justice, so I ended up buying most of my favorites. I'm sorry to say, but to me Sean Connery is the only Bond. With the single exception being Craig in ""Casino Royale"". When I was growing up, I did enjoy Moore's villains, but now his portrayal seems almost goofy. Moore was just an old guy in a tight suit. Connery seems to be the only actor that understands who or what Bond is. He is a well-paid assassin. But he is not simply a murderer. Not afraid to close fist punch a woman in the face or hold the door open for her. Later actors too often forgot that Bond is supposed to be graceful yet brutish. Approachable yet cold hearted. ""I admire your courage, Miss...? Sylvia Trench: I admire your luck, Mr...? Bond. James Bond."" This could well be my favorite line in cinema history. Not the often lame interpretations, but during the opening scene at the card table. It still gives me chills.I just wish they would get back to the basics. How many explosions and car chases does a person need to see. I thought he was a spy, they went and turned him into Rambo.",Dr. No
347,goddangwatir,Quite boring,5,1 March 2020,"One major problem I have with the first installment in the James Bond franchise, Dr. No, is the fact that it is in many ways too old for me. It is classified as a 'thriller', but the action scenes are quite dated and simply boring. They don't inflict a sense of urgency or excitement, rather a sense of 'when-is-this-going-to-be-over'.The pacing and the screenplay (excluding the one-liners) aren't that great either. If the face reveal of the villain, Dr. No, had come a bit earlier in the film my rating of it would perhaps be higher. The reason for that being the fact that he is the light of the movie. Joseph Wiseman brings out an menacing performance, which makes one not forget the Chinese-German doctor so soon.Sean Connery makes for a great Bond, but if one were to compare his performance to other ones, they would in my opinion find that it is only an okay one. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder just isn't very good, and she is pretty forgettable along with the rest of the performances not mentioned in this review. Anthony Dawson as Prof. Dent deserves an honorable mention as being quite decent though.I can appreciate the fact that it is a classic and very iconic (the quotes, etc). The James Bond Theme is even one of my favorite pieces of movie music of all time. But other than that, it has very few redeeming qualities, and a heap of ones not so.5/10",Dr. No
348,a2d_music,started it all...,7,23 April 2000,"Not, by far, the best Bond movie, but still quite good.  Thisfilm feels a little overlong, and the motivations aren't clear,but Sean Connery has already nailed the character of James Bond.My main problems with the film stem mostly out of a dissatisfaction with the plot - we are never really told whatDr. No's deal is;  his goals are unclear.  Also, the titlesequence leaves much to be desired.On the other had, it has the image of the ultimate Bond girl,and some of the best biting Bondian comments in the series... ""and you've had your six.""  is just the epitome ofcool.  Telling of things to come!",Dr. No
349,Anscules,"""Fetch my shoes.""",8,19 January 2001,"DR. NO is a good Bond film, especially if you are able to project yourself mentally into a time when there was no such thing as a Bond film.  The opening seconds of the film are so strange - the film acts as if Bond has already been onscreen for years.  The gun barrel, the red sliding downscreen, the extremely confident theme music, the ""007""s which cascade down the side of the screen during the titles - all of these things probably mystified the film's original audiences.  To someone like myself, a lifelong Bond fan (for the good and the bad of it), these moments are like gold. Like a time machine.  The first Bond I saw was THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, and the first I saw in a cinema was A VIEW TO A KILL.  I was born in the Moore era (Roger, not Ted) and knew nothing of Sean.  Of course, when I found it hard to get used to Sean, my father threatened to disown me.  Ah, what great movies these are!  Someday I'll have kids, and I'll argue with them the same way.  The series is like my favorite pair of old shoes - sometimes I'm embarrassed by them, but they are so damned comfortable!  And it all began here.Ken Adam is a genius.  So is Binder, Hunt, Young and the rest.  God bless Saltzman and Broccoli.  Nothing makes me smile like watching a Bond movie. Even the bad ones!Yes, overtly chauvinist, sometimes racist (""Fetch my shoes"" Bond tells his black companion, and his companion does what he's told!  Yuck!), but an intelligent viewer can add these things onto the heap of overall nonsense present in these movies.Lastly, I'd like to thank MGM for their outrageously good DVD special editions.  Beautiful.  Attention to the world: never watch Bond panned and scanned in old beat-up prints on TBS again (with commercials, too).  These DVDs make even a middle of the road movie (like DR. NO) seem so fresh it's like you've not really seen it before.  And dig those menus!",Dr. No

It's not a bad film, but it is lacking typical Bond elements.Sean Connery is OK in his first outing as 007, but he still hasn't made Bond his own. The acting of the other actors isn't that great and the scriptdialogue isn't one of the best.Ursula Andress is named one of the most memorable Bond girls, but I really can't see why. Her acting is quite poor.Still, quite enjoyable to watch. Although this one hasn't aged that well over the years compared to the other movies. Dr. No is probably the most dated Bond picture.",Dr. No

A must for any Bond fan and also a great movie for people wondering what this franchise is all about.The plot details the investigation of the death of a British Agent named Strangways. Strangways was in Jamaica as a favour to the American CIA investigating whether radio interference to their missile and rocket launches was coming from the Jamaica area. Bond is sent to uncover what happened to Strangways and to find out what he discovered.The investigation leads him to a crime ring around Kingston, Jamaica. All are in fear of a mysterious scientist named Doctor No., who lives on the small island of Crab Key. Bond discovers that rock samples from Crab Key are radioactive and deduces Strangways also discovered this and was killed for it.Once on Crab Key, Bond meets the elusive Doctor No and his nuclear reactor which provides the power for his radio interference of the American launches. Bond is imprisoned and has to use all his cunning and skill to stop the topling of the American lunar rocket, defeat Doctor No and rescue the drop dead gorgeous Honey Ryder.This is an excellent, excellent movie which drags Bond deeper and deeper into this criminal world as the movie continues. Incredibly entertaining and a terrific introduction to this movie series.",Dr. No

To get right to the point, this is a must see for anyone who is not familiar with the Bond films and also a must see for those of my generation who are only familiar with the later Bond films (Goldeneye and beyond). The pacing may seem a little dated by today's typical action flicks but in no way ruins the movie. While Dr. No starts off a bit slow, it quickly picks up and doesn't fail to entertain in the least. It is certainly interesting to see Sean Connery in his early years playing what would would soon become his famous calling card as Agent 007.

Unlike later films it is a pretty straightforward spy story; that doesn't mean it doesn't have the fantastical elements of the later pictures. It's just more subdued. Still it gave two iconic moments: the classic Bond introduction, by which all other Bond introductions and first spoken, ""Bond. James Bond"" are judged by. And there is the moment when Ursula Andress emerges from the ocean. The title character and villain is given little screen time so he doesn't leave as big an impact as later villains. Still, Joseph Wiseman (ridiculously miscast as a person of Asian descent) gives a strong performance. The cast as a whole is quite good. Jack Lord is a bit wooden as Felix Leiter but he looks the part though. There are some difficult to see through modern eyes moments involving race relations; but I try to remind myself that one needs to view Bond films as products of their time.

355,orient_86,And so it begins...,1,23 June 2005,"Here I want to comment almost all of Bond movies and the whole Bond-thing.James Bond is an overrated genre and character. The hero doesn't have to be the perfect man with all the prince-charming qualities - this hero would be just boring. And James isn't that perfect man, but everybody say that he is! Well, think again! To start with this whole Bond-girl idea. I am not a feminist, but this is the most humiliating part an actress can play. OK, I can agree on the fact that he changes his lover in every movie and 2-5 times per movie (if he has needs...) but they are all stupid, helpless and ridiculous. In one movie, he gives her a automatic weapon to protect them and she falls in the water by trying to shoot! They all were bikini and no matter how bad he treats them they still jump in bed with him. And he does treat them bad. There was one time when he almost broke a girl's arm and kept slapping her in the face. The other time he called her a bitch and stopped a tape in her under-ware. Excuse me, but how in the world can people call that kind of guy a gentleman? Am I missing something? The women started to look more respectful in the '90 and beyond - to match the time and ideals. But they still have names like Christmas, Jinx etc. And before it was Honey and Octopussy...Well, enough about women - let's talk about his famous license to kill: OK, let me just say that - nobody has that right. That's why we put people in jails. The only situation in witch you can get away with murder is war. But you're ain't in no war, pally! So put away that gun of yours until you really need it! War. Yeah, that's what he is supposed to prevent, right? Well, it looks like he will start more wars with that attitude, neither than prevent. Killing people - is this another type of tough negotiating? Hm...Of course he has to kill since the bad guys are communists... oh, please, give it a rest! This ship has sailed! It's not even interesting anymore! And talking about brutality in Bond movies is like opening another Pandora's box.Yeah, Mr. Bond, you really know how to blow!",Dr. No

As for the movie Dr. No, I didn't hate it, in fact I liked it, but compared to other Bond films this was no where near the top of the poll and in fact it probably ranks number 19 out of the 21 that are out now. I did think the plot was good, the acting was fine, the music was good, however the pacing and action sequences needed to be done a little better.

359,fidelio7,'That's a Smith and Wesson. And you've had your six.',8,2 March 2011,"'Dr. No' is one of my favourite Bond films. It is stylish and very spare, and introduces the best James Bond ever, Sean Connery. The storyline is lean and muscular, and focuses upon the reclusive and mysterious Dr. No, who is attempting to thwart the US space programme. It is up to Bond to stop him.In his debut as Bond, Connery is suave and charming, but he is also cold and ruthless. He has what it takes to get the job done, and he takes no prisoners. He has some great lines in this film and really holds his own as an actor, creating an indelible impression as the British superspy.Ursula Andress offers great support as the stunning and athletic Honeychile 'Honey' Ryder, and Joseph Wiseman has just the right amount of sophistication and danger to him. The story takes its time to unfold, and the pace is steady but never leaden. There are some great action set pieces: the car chase which culminates in a fiery demise for Bond's pursuer, Bond coming upon a tarantula in his bed, and - of course - the inevitable destruction of Dr. No's hideout.Terence Young's direction is assured and he displays a very good eye for detail. Jack Lord, who played Detective Steve McGarrett in the long-running 'Hawaii Five-O' television series, is a welcome presence as Felix Leiter, who assists Bond on his mission to defeat the evil Dr. No.'Dr. No' is one of the best Bond films, and it is fun to watch again and again. There is great sexual tension betwixt 'Honey' and Bond, and they work very well together. The film restoration process has worked wonders for first twenty Bond films, and it gives you a chance to watch the very first Bond film with lush colours and crisp, digitally remastered sound. No matter how many times you have seen this movie, the restoration process makes it seem as though you are viewing it for the first time. Do not miss your chance to see where it all began.",Dr. No

He started what has been a passion of mine for many years. The James Bond movies have always been topical, and somewhat relevant to the current events of the day.The film see's Bond go up against Dr No, his three blind assassins, Professor Dent and . For the first time we got the see the charismatic secret agent, plus Q and M. The love interests in this film are played by Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder and Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench.Some people may look upon it and say there were better movies later in the franchise, but this was the first it set the tone and the mould on which all later movies were made.

361,tylarwagner,A Decent Foundation,7,22 February 2019,"I have mixed feelings on ""Dr. No"". It was the first Bond film, so I feel like I have to give it a pass in many different areas. The first act is pretty enjoyable and the second act gets even better. But the third act is pretty boring. I can forgive a film for not having much action, but I feel this way because I find Dr. No to be a boring villain. I decided to review this after my second viewing and I liked the first two acts more than I did on the first watch, but I think I liked the third act even less this time around. This movie isn't bad, but it does make me appreciate some of the other films more.Pros:
While not my favorite Bond actor, Sean Connery carries this movie.; The film has some solid dialogue.Cons:
Boring Villain; Boring sets in the third act.; Some of the acting is mediocre.",Dr. No
362,stephengward,The name's.......,10,20 March 2000,"Made on a modest budget of $1 million dollars, James Bond finally bursts onto the silver screen eight years after first appearing in the novel ""Casino Royale"". At this stage 007 hadn't become acquainted with the benefits of gadgets (presumably budget constraints were one of the factors for this), therefore the script concentrates on Bond using his wits to evade tricky situations. Its a good opener for the series that contains many elements still present today. However, it wasn't until Goldfinger two years later that the archetypal Bond movie was produced. The meagre budget is spent wisely thanks mainly to Ken Adam's set designs that look both lavish and costlier then they actual were. ""Monty Norman"" provides the rather disappointing score for the soundtrack. It's still a contentious issue as to whether ""Norman"" or ""John Barry"" composed the ""James Bond"" theme that makes its debut here. Whoever did compose it is secondary, the 	original Bond theme is excellent and is an ever present here and in many subsequent 007 films made in the sixties. The plot revolves around Dr No's (Joseph Wiseman) attempts to topple U.S. missiles, 007 is sent to Jamaica to investigate......... Jack Lord is ""Felix Leiter"" 007's long time ally, he's the first in a long line of actors to play this role and for me is the best of the bunch. Six years later ""Lord"" would find success as ""Steve McGarrett"" in the long running police show ""Hawaii Five-0"". Interesting if morbid piece of trivia is that Joseph Wiseman is the only actor surviving that played a Bond villain in sixties.",Dr. No
363,sqdb,"The First Bond Film, But Hardly The Best...",4,15 September 2016,"This film was the first official Bond film to hit cinemas back in 1962. It kick-started Sean Connery's career, introduced the world to the cinematic James Bond and is, to many people, a truly iconic and important film...Okay, let's get straight to the point. Dr No is not a great Bond film or even a great film in general. I know that a great deal of people have a special place in their hearts for this film and I respect that. However, modern audiences may hold an entirely different opinion of this film. I know that a lot of people may not agree with my opinion and that is their choice, but I still maintain that this film is nowhere near as good as most of the Bond films that were to follow.There are some good points about Dr. No, though. Everyone knows about the ""spider"" scene and Ursula Andress looks great in that iconic white bikini. Sean Connery has also never looked cooler as Bond as he was in this film. The film also introduced audiences to the now instantly recognisable James Bond theme, which is first heard over the starting credits. It is also used several times throughout the film.However, I think the negative points outweigh the positives. The film is now hopelessly dated and I think it has dated more than any other Bond film. The portrayal of the black characters can also, in some ways, be seen as stereotypical and even borderline racist. Bond's ""fetch my shoes"" line to Quarrel never fails to make me squirm with embarrassment. There are also very few action sequences and no stand-out set-pieces. I also believe that Dr. No, although worthy of a viewing, would not stand up to repeat viewings, as it is simply not entertaining enough. Even the Roger Moore Bond films are more entertaining than this and yes, I do include Moonraker.As I mentioned, this was Connery's first Bond film and I know, to many people, he will always be the ultimate Bond. I do agree with that, up to a point. However, even he made some real stinkers as Bond. Goldfinger, in my opinion, is vastly over-rated and not much better than Dr. No in terms of entertainment value. Thunderball is too long and is the most boring Bond film, in my opinion, due to the long and slow underwater scenes. I am not even going to comment on the execrable Diamonds Are Forever...So, to sum up, Dr. No is a film firmly of its time. I would imagine it had much greater impact when seen in cinemas for the first time back in 1962, but I just don't think it has stood the test of time very well. I would recommend a viewing for any serious Bond fan, but they will probably find that one viewing is enough. Connery made much better Bond films than this, so I would instead direct people to check out either From Russia With Love or You Only Live Twice. I find these films endlessly watchable. I give Dr. No four stars, because it was a ground-breaking film, but very far from the best of Bond.",Dr. No

365,genesisj,They don't make them like this anymore.,9,28 May 2000,"I didn't get a chance to see this in the theaters and it was the 4th Bond film I saw but that's OK. I can see why Bond caught on so well with this film for an opening act. By the time I saw my 2nd Bond film I had read most of Flemings books but there is no substitute to seeing Connery bring him to life so well. I guess it helps if you are a young adult when you first experience Bond. At that age, you see Bond outrageously portraying Gods gift to women and think ya, that's the way you do it, works for him. Despite the fun memories it brings out, this film will stand the test of time and probably be the downfall of every poor actor that tries to continue the magic.",Dr. No

It is a classic among Bond fans and also if you're not a Bond fan, you'll have lots of fun with it.But don't expect too much action! (except in the ending scene, which is rather short). This is more like a crime/thriller than an action/thriller.The plot is quite weird and rather harmless (disturbing U. S. rockets, so what?), and also some scenes are weird (nuclear check, I say), but most of the movie is just great - as an agent movie should be!This is one of the movues I'll never get tired watching.",Dr. No
368,cheewawa-1,"Rough, Tough & Ready!",10,20 February 2002,"For the first of the long running series it's not a bad movie by any standards.  It's got the first gentleman secret agent.  It's a very beautifly filmed movie too.  The location is tropical and warm.  Ursula Andress just adds to the heat of this rough around the edges spy movie.Thanks to director Terence Young, we got a slightly polished Sean Connery. He brought a very much needed bit of brashness to the role and Young taught him to be debonair as well.Connery works his charm and machismo as well and makes this one of the most honest of all the Bond films.  There's very little gadgets here and he relies on his own wits through out the movie.A very sinister villian portrayed by Joseph Wiseman.  Graceful and sleek, he's a villain who doesn't get verbal, he just does it.  He's so calm and quiet, you get an erie feeling just when he's looking at you.But this is the one that started it all.  They only get better from here, so set aside a weekend and start here and work your way to the end.  It's Bond time baby!  I give it 10 stars.  It's basic Bond and it's AWESOME! Ciao",Dr. No
369,freefaller_03,Dr. No...the means to a beginning?,7,13 December 2006,"A fellow user on this site has been in the process of analyzing each Bond movie using a system of standards and quotas...a rating system breaking down each element that makes up a Bond film, and giving the film a final score out of 100. Only problem is, I believe his criticisms to be...well, a bit TOO critical. So, even though I will probably garner just as much guff from the people who agree with (him/her?), I will attempt to do the same, from a different standpoint, using a similar breakdown of elements. So, beginning at the logical place to start, here we go:Title (DR. NO) - intriguing, but unfortunately doesn't really relate to Bond. And besides, the only time the villain's name has worked as the title was Goldfinger...and let's leave it that way. 2.5/5Pre-credit sequence - Non-existent. True this was the FIRST Bond film, but what can you do? 0/10Credits sequence - After the silly blinking light thing is done, we get the first silhouette work by Maurice Binder which would evolve into the standard Bond opening up until For Your Eyes Only. Action matches the opening music well. 4/5Theme/performed songs: -The James Bond Theme (Monty Norman): Classic. Absolute classic. -Three Blind Mice: segues nicely into the first scene. Catchy too. -Under the Mango Tree: Adds a nice easygoing island flavor to the film. A great lineup of songs to start the series. 5/5Bond...James Bond (Sean Connery) - Connery's first outing as Bond shows that while he was probably a little unsure about what to do with the character, he was having a great time doing it, as he gives us the classic introduction: ""I admire your luck, Mr...?"" ""Bond...James Bond."" And across a baccarat table, no less. Plus, cheers for Bond SINGING when he first meets Honey. Others may find that part silly, but I always thought it was great. 9/10Villain - The main criticism against Joseph's Wiseman's titular villain was that he came across as...what was the word used...comatose? Maybe, or maybe it was just cold, rooted evil, portrayed in that unrealistic way we all love and come to expect from early Bond villains. Plus, there's a certain ambiguity in the character...we never truly know whether Dr. No truly has no time, patience, or care about Bond, or if he's simply trying to hide his anxiety behind a mask of cold, Eastern malaise. Still, there is definitely something missing here. 6.5/10Babes - I don't know about any other Bond fans out there, but let me just say this...there IS more to this movie that just Ursual Andress. But yes, she did set the standard, giving us that oh so hot bod emerging from the sea in the bikini...all wet, and gleaming...but I digress. Andress' Honey Ryder is also a strong, independent, defiant figure...at least until they get carted off to Dr. No's lair. Then for some reason she becomes all soft and whimpering. Hmm. Now on to the other women in the film. Lois Maxwell (here still young and attractive) puts in her first appearance as Moneypenny, the MI.6 secretary who pines away not-so-secretly for Mr. Bond. Then there's Eunice Gayson as the persistent gambler Sylvia Trench, who actually takes the initiative with Bond...if you can believe it. And finally, Zena Marshall's alluring Miss Taro was a great buildup to Honey...seductive, dangerous...everything a Bond femme fatale should be. 8/10""Baddies"": Not too many to speak of here. A bunch of faceless, nameless Asian and Jamaican guards...a henchman posing as a chauffeur that gets killed off in 5 minutes...Anthony Dawson as the panicky, obvious Professor Dent...but the one standout is the Three Blind Mice, a trio of incognito hit men who run around in an old hearse...definitely colorful and quirky, like many Bond villains would be later on. 5.5/10Nefarious plot: Dr. No works for SPECTRE to undermine the American Space Program. To what end? Who knows? But he sure goes about it in an overly elaborate and exotic way. Over-the-top? For sure. Bond-ian? Definitely. 6/10Scripting: Spy technobabble a little out of control here. We do get some nice moments though: the banter between Bond and Sylvia in the Casino and his apartment; the introduction of Leiter and Quarrel; But a lot of moments really drag on far too long, like Bond's trip through the ventilation ducts, or the actual infiltration of the control room. However, we do get to see the beginning of the Bond-ian wit: ""Make sure he doesn't get away."" 6/10Production values: Well, it was the early 60s. Use of rear/front projection and day-for-night shooting is cringe-worthy here, but the lush shooting of the island/jungle scenes and Ken Adam's designs help this one along. 8/10Score: One of the key elements of a good Bond film. The score here by Monty Norman adds that nice exotic flavor of Jamaica by introducing local sounds where possible, and Dr. No's theme itself, heard in its best form during Bond and Quarrel's arrival at the island, works very well. But much of it still comes off as campy and silly. Not the best way to start the series. 2.5/5Bonus points: Well, it did start the series. 2 points for that.Summary: A good first effort...definitely not the best in the series, this one goes for the lush exoticism of locales and the simple intrigue of the spy game. Better films would follow.Total: 65/100James Bond will return in FROM Russia WITH LOVE",Dr. No
370,JMitnik,The Movie That Started It All...,7,28 March 2010,"So let me start by saying, I have watched all of the JB movies with Sean Connery. I still think this ranks number 2...The opening sequence is somehow splendid(although most people will find it kind of boring, seeing as every Bond movie has done this already). I still like how they narrate the film from a different perspective. The music is also extremely gorgeous. I really like the theme song, and in this movie, it does bring it back the whole time, which may be a good thing. Well, the special effects were quite OK, nothing too special. No special actions. I did like how Bond was introduced in the movie. This is probably one of the most epic intro's a movie character ever had.As for the story... well, I guess in that time, it was OK. It is nothing special now... I did like.All that combined, it makes a splendid entrance to the long franchise. I give the movie a 7/10",Dr. No
371,RasAlBane,A great start for Bond,9,7 January 2015,"The first Bond screen adventure, oh my god how i love this film! the sense of adventure and greatness this is. Sean Connery steps in to the role with a great performance no need for him to take time to get in to the role, he was already spectacular here. This film has a very good and a simple story that is easy to follow and easy to enjoy. Bond investigating a death with a lot of interferences and strange characters that leads him to crab key with one of Bonds most likable allies quarrel which ofcaurse gets killed in the movie just as all the other Bond allies except for Felix Leiter who always gets replaced by a different actor, i wonder if that is because the actors are afraid that their character Leiter will just be killed soon enough like any other Bond ally? anyways... We have a very iconic scene with Honey Rider that everyone should recognize and some fine great adventure scene on crab key. The scene where Honey tells Bond about her past is great. But the highlight of this movie for me is definitely the chat between Bond and Doctor No.. some really great Dialouge there. And ofcaurse the first film shows how easy it is for Bond to escape any situation.. We have a nice ending scene where Bond refuses to be tied to another boat since he needs some alone time with his Honey. Doctor No is a great classic Bond.",Dr. No
372,tmm_8705,"""That's a Smith & Wesson, and you've had your six.""",8,2 November 2014,"Dr. No is the real deal. Director Terence Young is a major contribution to how Bond is who he is in the films. Fleming gets credit for starting it all with the books, but Terence Young deserves credit for shaping the character for cinemas. Connery wouldn't be a major star without Young's help, and he shows that on every interview he is on when discussing Bond, trying to make sure no one would forget how vital Young was. His leaving the series is also another possible reason why he'd eventually have a falling out with the Bond producers that lead to his departure.It's definitely a Bond film, but it's much different from all the follow ups. It has less action and Bond is more of a detective here. That's mostly because this film is low budget. Some of that shows such as Bond featured in a car chase where he's obviously in front of back projection. However, despite instances like that it overall doesn't feel low budget because of how well made it is. The script is solid and a great with Sean Connery who just oozes charisma, already playing it cool on his first frame. The locations and elaborate sets are made to full effect, leaving a big impression onto viewers.There's a reason Sean Connery is most popular Bond. With his natural charisma and cool attitude it's no wonder his films were the biggest and most hyped of the series. Connery is cool, tough as nails, dangerous and when he needs to be, ruthless. In Dr. No, Bond was at his peak when it came to being ruthless. A scene between Bond and a henchman named Dent really elaborates on that idea.The supporting players are all good as well. Jack Lord is the best of all the Felix Leiters. It's a shame he couldn't reprise the role. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder is gorgeous, adding to the exotic nature of this film. If any flaw, the characters do not feel as well rounded as they were in the novel the film is based on. The lead up to Dr. No's lair, Crab Key, arguably takes longer to get to in the film than it did in the novel. It's not damning to the film, but it's always been something on the back of my mind.In many ways this is the quintessential Bond film. It doesn't have staples the next films would play with like gadgets, but there's enough here to surprise anyone who's familiar with Bond on how Bondian it was from the start, such as the beginning with the gun barrel having the signature theme music blasting. All that said, it's a pretty laid back picture compared to what would come later in the series. It's best described as a ""hang out picture"", where viewers are asked to settle down and take in the atmosphere, characters, etc. I'd say that's an accurate description of most Bond films starring Sean Connery.",Dr. No
373,alexthegreat87,Started the engine,6,23 November 2002,"Dr. No is not a great film. However, it is known as simply the 1st Bond movie ever, and really started the Bond craze to the cinemas. In film quality, Dr. No probably hits the lowest of the low of the Bond movies- it is interesting, especially Urusula Andress coming out from the sea, but overall the movie is just too-slow paced (a 60s movie trademark) that doesn't really show what true Bond movies are about.

What would have been wrong with a battle between Bond and a giant sea creature? Or even better, Dr. No getting buried alive in bird dung! Very good movie until they stray from the book. Unfortunately that happens about 25 minutes in. Would be the weakest of the Connery Bonds if not for Diamonds Are Forever.

Although the ones that are in it are good.I thought that all of the charcaters that would be brought back in the other movies were well introduced like M, Moneypenny and Leiter.

376,shakennotstirred,James Bond portrayed the way Ian Fleming created him.,8,11 January 2004,"Simple fact: You either like James Bond films, or you don't. If you don't, I would advise you not to waste your time with this review. However, if you do, read on...Plot synopsis: An MI6 agent and his secretary are murdered while in Jamaica working on an inquiry regarding massive interference with American rocket launches. 007 is sent to investigate. Along the way he crosses paths with several beautiful young women, a helpful CIA agent (played to perfection by Jack Lord), and a megalomaniacal villain.....OK, it's a James Bond movie, do you reeeeeeeeeeeeeally need a plot synopsis? Didn't think so. Now on to the good stuff...Even though this is the first James Bond film, it doesn't have a few of the things that have gone on to become Bond trademarks. There is no pre-title sequence, no gadgets, and no appearance by ""Q""; although a character named Major Boothroyd (the official name of Desmond Llewelyn's character) does issue Bond his handgun, though played by a different actor. What this film DOES have though, more than any other 007 flick is the James Bond character portrayed the way Ian Fleming wrote him. Anyone familiar with the novels knows that James Bond wasn't particularly friendly, and was about as far away from the ""cute, cuddly Bond"" that Roger Moore gave us as you could get. In fact, the James Bond that Ian Fleming created was pretty much a cold, ruthless ba****d.Back in 1961 Harry Saltzman optioned the screen rights to Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. He then formed EON productions with Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli and they began the task of bringing 007 to the silver screen. They then signed Sean Connery to play Bond and Terence Young to direct. Sean and Terence were themselves fans of the Fleming novels and thankfully remembered one thing that almost all of today's movie stars and directors forget: If you're making a movie based upon books (comics or otherwise) STAY FAITHFUL TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL! cough*Sam Raimi*cough*Spider-Man*cough. Sean Connery and Terence Young did just that, they brought Bond to the screen the way he was written: as an arrogant, ruthless, misogynistic character; albeit a very smooth and cool one... Hey, if you can watch Bond's intro in the casino and not smile the first time Connery utters the immortal line ""Bond, James Bond"", you should never bother watching another 007 film.There are certain things that feel dated but should be forgiven due to the fact that the movie was filmed in 1962. This film should be viewed as what it is: the introduction to James Bond and the series, a task that it pulls off superbly.The new version of the DVD includes a great 42 minute 'making-of' documentary. A definite must-see for any Bond fan. Especially entertaining is watching Peter Hunt try to justify his ABYSMAL editing job on the action scenes.A few fun facts that could be considered VERY MINOR SPOILERS:James has 2 of his trademark ""Medium-dry vodka martinis, shaken not stirred"" (If you looked at my I.D., you HAD to know that I was going to throw that in somewhere!) Although he does not actually order either one on screen.The 3 Bond Girls in 'Dr. No' are Sylvia Trench (Eunice Gayson), Miss Taro (Zena Marshall), and Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress).If you've seen any of the 'Austin Powers' movies you will definitely laugh when Dr. No introduces himself as, ""The unwanted child of a German missionary and a Chinese girl of good family"".

He is more alert and many small things (like licking a strand of hair over closet door) add a nice touch that the other movies fail to achieve. Connery is the youngest actor ever to play Bond. When the movie was made he was not yet a star, so I believe this to be his best acting effort. Jack Lord plays the best Felix Leiter. He was asked to come back in GOLDFINGER, but he demanded too much money. Ursula Andress, Honey Rider, was completely dubbed over (not that it matters). Anyway the story goes like this. Energy waves are interfering with a missile launch site, 007 is sent to Jamaica to investigate. As he is finding the truth you get everything from thrilling car chases to poisonous spiders to dragons that run on diesel. He has problems with his new gun-Walther PPK.

I will admit however, that the final battle is a bit of a letdown, but I suppose in 1962 it was up to speed.  It's not so much the action and the stunts, but the plot thats the main thing.

So get used to Jamaica for 1 1/2 hours. While on the Island he is investigating the assassination of a couple agents. Of course he will meet a hot half naked Ursula, a big part of this film.

Perhaps today it can seem dated and the production values may come across as quaint, but considering it's 1962 and the budget was about one million dollars, the final product commands respect.Sean Connery's introduction as Bond is perfectly conceived and executed as a cool, debonair with the exterior of an adventuresome playboy but inside beats the heart of a professional killer in the service of the Crown. While it's probably true that the first incarnation of a character is usually considered the best, it's hard to imagine liking Connery any less if he were following Roger Moore instead of the other way around.The story is fairly faithful to Ian Fleming's novel. The adaptation allows for more traditional action sequences like car chases and fist fights, all of which serve to show agent 007 as the jack-of-all-trades that would later be developed to limitless fronts.Other casting is very successful, from the recurring characters of Bernard Lee as M and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny to the main villain of Dr. No portrayed by a serpent-smooth Joseph Wiseman. Ursula Andress makes a distinct impression as Honey Rider, one of Bond's many signature conquests.The science fiction plot in the Jamaica setting is one of the things I love about the world of James Bond. And the film production assembles the fresh and energetic talents of what would become legendary artists in their own right including composer John Barry (responsible for performing the classic Bond theme), production designer Ken Adam, editor Peter Hunt, screenwriter Richard Maibaum, and director Terence Young. Of course, the partnership of Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman is what made it all happen. And the cinema was all the better because of it.If you understand the character of James Bond, particularly from a Cold War perspective, you'll love this movie.",Dr. No
384,SharpShooter5,A strong first outing for 007,8,30 August 2003,"Dr. No is a beautiful film, that serves its purpose in the History of James Bond.Its not over the top and it relies more on dialog and exotic locations to continue the plot rather then the big explosions and stunts we see in the modern 007 adventures(although it does have its share).Sean Connery is right on in this one, unlike other actors who have become Bond, Connery didn't need 2 or 3 films to settle into the role, you believe he is James Bond right from the first moment we see him. This is partly due to the fact that we had not seen another actor in the role on the big screen, but it can mostly be attributed to Connery's brilliant performance.So all in all Dr. No is not the greatest 007 film, but its also not the worst, the story is a little sub-par compared to the Moore, Dalton and Brosnan films, but its got enough to hold your attention for 2 hours.8 stars",Dr. No
385,thekevin124,Bond gets started with a bang,7,31 March 2019,"I just watched this for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised by a few things in this film. First, the car chase scenes. I assumed it would be 100 % green screen. However the green screen scenes were few, and the actual filming of the high-speed chases really upped the excitement of the film. Also, the filming on location really makes you feel like you are there and the movie isn't being filmed in some big room. The plot was fine, the villain was lackluster without depth, but the deception and that feeling of ""is this person a good guy or bad guy"" was excellent throughout.",Dr. No
386,aledownload,Review from a Bondian,9,24 December 2019,"""Dr. No"" is a mix of exciting action, glorious adventure, great romance, very good characters, 1960s-style science fiction, clever investigation, fantastic music, impressive visuals and a quite heavy adaptation of Fleming's novel. James Bond's first theatrical adventure is an almost perfect spy story, set in a wonderful British Jamaica, where there were still lots of Englishmen. The film presents us agent 007 as wonderful in doing his job, wonderful with women, wonderful at the steering wheel and wonderful in fighting: almost like the quintessence of the stereotypical spy (which this film inspired).",Dr. No
387,george_pleasant,"Great, but not the best.",8,10 September 2000,"This is a good Bond film, unlike the FX heavy trash that's been added to the series recently.  It's got a good mystery as the basic storyline.  It has many errors though, disappearing and reappearing props, and the funny scene where the man talks through a megaphone, and when he's not yelling though the megaphone he sounds the same.  But the story is good.  Most of the characters are introduced for the first time and it makes a great opened for one of the best and longest lasting series ever.",Dr. No

Five actors, Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan, have played Ian Flemmings bestseller novel character James Bond. But I still believe that Sean Connery is the best of them all. He is the one with the best Bond attitude. He is the right. I have even read that in the first novels Ian Flemming have expressed that Bonds favorite actor was/is Sean Connery.The movie was a revolution. It wasn´t the plan first to make a sequel and absolutely not 18.",Dr. No
389,encinoghetto,Just because it was the first does not make it the best,4,7 December 2002,"Hello people. Wake up and smell the coffee. I know many of you out there think that Dr. No is one of the greatest Bond films ever made and that Sean Connery is the greatest Bond ever. It's almost a knee jerk reaction for many of you supposed PURISTS. Just because he was first does not make him the best. Did he make some great Bond movies? OH YEA! Goldfinger, Thunderball, You only Live Twice, for instance. I'll not talk much about Never Say Never Again. Octopussy made more money in head to head competition. Was Sean the best Bond? Maybe to many people he is. Not to me, but that's a matter of personal opinion. Was Dr. No one of the Best Bond movies? NO WAY! Look. Roger Moore as Bond pulled in over a BILLION DOLLARS in his seven film run. Could he have stopped earlier? Yes, but he still made money even late in his Bond career. None of his seven films were as bad as Dr. No. Not even The Man With The Golden Gun. I strongly disagree that Dr. No is really even any good at all. Just because it was the first does not make it the best or even in the top nineteen of the twenty films to date. The pacing is so slow that it takes almost half the film to get interesting at all. There are no great gadgets, no great musical score, no good lines, NO Q, and there is A GIANT MECHANICAL DRAGON THAT KILLS QUARREL. Yeesh. That thing looks like a Jr. Highschool shop experiment gone bad! Yea. I know it was made in 1961 and released in '62. So what? It makes no difference. Be honest with yourselves. This movie is tough sledding. In other words it's hard to sit through. I have collected all the Bond movies on DVD. My wife had never seen a Bond movie in it's entirety before I met her. My friend, (a huge Dr. No and Connery fan) put it in his player and my wife laughed all the way through. He was infuriated as I am sure many of the people reading this review are. How dare she not like it! Yes, it's nostalgic. Yes, it started it all. Yes, it had Sean in it. That's nice and all, but it's terrible. You want good Connery as Bond? Rent Thunderball or Goldfinger.",Dr. No
390,sherriemarconi,One of the best,10,4 September 2013,"This is one of my favorite Bond movies. They should really remake it be because this film has an awesome location not really seen in the other films that usually take place somewhere like the UK. The ending is amazing! I loved the whole Bond, Honey, Quarrel on the run from the villains while hiding in a creek thing. And the villains are awesome (Dr. No, The Photographer, Miss Taro) and for once the allies are just as amazing. I was actually sad when Quarrel died. Don't watch this film and because it's too old turn it off. Because it is old so it's not gonna be as straight-to-the-point and fast moving as the newer films but once it does get to its point it's awesome! So watch this film.",Dr. No
391,tonywerner,Everything must begin somewhere,8,6 November 2003,"Well, I'm a huge James Bond fan, so I forgive much in this movie. Everything must begin somewhere. In retrospect I think, this is one of the weakest 007-adventures - but it must've been something else in 1962. In fact it HAS been, because very few motion picture of that time is still (even) this enjoyable to watch. There is many silly mistakes in movie. A little more careful work, and it would have been more convincing. Sean Connery in the leading role is a bit wooden, but - as I said - everyone must begin somewhere. Everyone must know, what this movie is about, so I don't bore you with the plot outlines. This is very first official James Bond -adventure, therefore: 8/10.",Dr. No
392,dennisco-76051,For those keeping track...,7,3 April 2018,..James Bond got it on with 3 women in this movie.,Dr. No
393,nathaniel-04908,A great start for the franchise,7,11 August 2020,"Dr. No is a 1962 film directed by Terence Young and based off of Ian Fleming's novel of the same name. It is the first film to feature James Bond, the world's most famous secret agent. This alone has earned it a spot in history as the start of one of the longest running and most significant film franchises ever made. At the time of my writing this, there are 25 films spanning 58 years, with a 26th to be released in three months. For this reason, Dr. No will always hold a special place in the hearts of many fans, from many generations. As a latecomer to the series, I do not share this nostalgia, but the film still holds up very well.
Watching it today, one of the most notable things about Dr. No is the overabundance of tropes. It checks every box you would come to expect from a James Bond film, and come to resent from their many copycats. Nonetheless, it is a film that is absolutely oozing with style. Sean Connery pulls of the lead roll with seemingly effortless sophistication and charisma, and I would give him a large part of the credit for this film's success, and by extension the success of the franchise.
The story that Dr. No tells is simple and straightforward, but I generally feel that this works in its favor. We are thrown right into the action, and we are shown with great efficiency and effectiveness exactly the type of character that Bond is. This is not a film that wastes your time. The first 80 minutes of Dr. No are everything you want from a Bond film, but near the end I sadly feel that it falters somewhat.
Though it still far from terrible and retains every ounce of the style that makes this film so great, the storytelling in the final act is simply not as good. I do feel that a lot of this may be due to it not necessarily aging the best. Dr. No is an incredibly clichéd villain, and although it should certainly be noted that this film is largely responsible for most of the tropes it presents, it can still feel somewhat tiresome. Dr. No is a ridiculously overdramatic villain, and between his private island and his robotic hands he fits the mold for a 'Bond villain' perfectly. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when it comes to the final act a villain that is supposed to be very menacing and incredibly intelligent ends up coming across as incompetent. This leads to an ending that feels quite abrupt, and even a little anticlimactic.
The Bond franchise is also notorious for its 'Bond girls,' female leads who are usually throwaway characters, included entirely for sex appeal. Dr. No is no exception. The character of Honey Ryder in this film has no real bearing on the story, and everything could have played out in exactly the same way without her inclusion. Bond always has, and always will be a womanizer, a character trait with which I have no problem, but this often comes at the expense of the female leads. For this reason, I am glad that, while certainly very present, these aspects of Bond's character are less extreme than they are in some of the later films. Honey Ryder is an unfortunately irrelevant character, but she is also a very small one. The film doesn't spend too much time on these parts of the story.
Dr. No is not the best Bond film, but it is the first, and for that it deserves recognition. It does an excellent job of establishing Bond's character, and it is gripping from start to finish. If you want to watch a Bond movie, then Dr. No will give you everything you expect to see, and very little else. It is far from a masterpiece, but it established all of the tropes you expect to see from a Bond film, good and bad, and that at the very least is laudable.",Dr. No
394,Ian Fleming,A Great Start to the 007 Series!,7,28 February 2002,"Dr.No was the beginning of what is now a legacy. Although it is clear that the film is incredibly dated, the performances of the entire cast (espically Sean Connery) are still some of the best in all of Movie history. The plot itslef is also still farily believable today. A real thriller!!!",Dr. No
395,perryman-65758,A Grounded and Barebones Bond film I was not brought up with this.,8,21 October 2021,"Being born in the Brosnan error you can understand the level of Bond I have had to ensure.Watching this was a breath of fresh air.Although many people preferred from Russia with love I preferred this. Just a personal taste.Bond is called to Jamaica to investigate a series of deaths. Now to some it might seem a bit slow and boring and I totally understand this. But to me I enjoyed the slow investigation it felt more spy like.The Baron country side and settings really give this gritty thriller feel, with just a right dose of exotic resorts and houses to give it that bond flavour.Dr No is also a great villain he is really smart and you really feel that he throws legit challenges at bond and is reacting every step of the way, in a realistic manner how you would expecting a powerful person with a private militarised island and high connections to react.Bond really feels like a spy in hostile territory against overwhelming odds, he steps off the plane and instantly people want him dead. You really feel the danger he is in. Almost every interaction or thing he does not with his allies results in an attempt on his life or information being gathered by the enemy l.Generally he is on his own with no fancy gadgets, or a fancy Aston Martin. He doesnt beat up and shoot 40 people on his own there are no big action set peices. Just a man with his smarts and his tiny pistol.And that brings us to the final part of the film. Which feels dlsatisfyingThe only flaw I really had was that there was an excessive use of the main bond theme where it wasn't needed. They play it in full when there is nothing really happening.He's in a casino playing cards it comes on, he's securing his hotel room it comes on, walks around in the airport and uses a payphone it comes on. You will be shouting ""he's not doing anything why is this playing"" alot.",Dr. No
396,hot_shot-pyro-630-280385,Unbelievable it was made in 1962.,9,17 March 2013,"Though it's dated, ""Dr.No"" tells us what is the spirit of 007 movie. When I watched this movie for the first time, I was so surprised finding something which I can't get from the latest movies. Yeah, I was so surprised.James Bond is humorous, but also a cold killer after all. And Sean Connery knows it. He stays quiet, gentle, and doesn't make a fuss like later Bonds do. When he has to do his job, he hits enemies with one certain shot. He doesn't shoot a machine gun until magazine becomes empty. And that's the way a spy should be, right? Also fighting scenes are gripping even without VFX stuff. Today so many movies are using VFX to make action scene gorgeous, sometimes actors are even fighting on the green screen, but this movie never needs for such things. Honestly I've never imagined to feel like this after watching ""Skyfall"". I was grown up surrounded by movies full of VFX, but even so, every scene of this movie is definitely attractive and something unforgettable. Yes, it's even better than newer ones!I believe this movie is one of the proves showing how really good movie can stand with the test of time. Thanks to the lesson from ""Dr.No"", now I must watch all of the legacy of this series. There must be so many I can't miss!",Dr. No
397,Hulk007,It gets better...,7,4 December 2006,"Dr. No's greatest claim to fame is that it's the first Bond film. If it were not, it likely would be regarded as one of the mediocre entries in the series. It gets things started off well enough, what with introducing the unmatched Sean Connery as 007 and bringing us the iconic scene of Honey Ryder emerging from the water. Some of the repartee isn't too bad, and the first half of the movie or so is grounded in some sort of reality that still goes down smooth. Unfortunately, it makes the second half of the movie look just downright silly, with Bond encountering his first megalomaniac villain, complete with mechanical hands and a nuclear powerplant secret island headquarters.Connery is superb and Ursula Andress iconic; otherwise, the movie is hardly memorable. 007 can do better, and he did the next year in From Russia With Love, which I believe stands as the series' best. Goldfinger, two years later, is quite excellent as well.Not a terrible film at all, but were it not the first in the series, I'd have given it six stars, and not seven. Better things were still to come.",Dr. No
398,Trevelyan006,A fine start,7,3 August 2002,"Bond provided a highly successful thriller, and an excellent prototype for films to come. The budget was used well for the time, producing a thriller that looked much more expensive than one  million dollars. The film was a blockbuster success. Firstly, Bond's vices turned him into a superb anti-hero, and condemnation of Bond by the Vatican and the Kremlin caused audiences to flock in huge numbers to the film, which had received good critical acclaim.  To this day it remains a classic favourite with traditional Bond fans, a great watch for any lover of a great thriller",Dr. No

The music is phenomenal in all JB movies. Especially the mango tree song. There's great little action scenes of a car jumping off a cliff and funny punch lines. Sean Connery does such a great job, even though it's embarrassing and cheesy to watch. I love the irrelevant fire breathing tank. It's so fun to see them end up in a scientific lab. Dr. No's death was pretty intense, but he deserved it. Sean and his bond girl were sweet, and a great partners in crime Sean was very sexual and flirty. Ending is always the same, on a boat. Why would they want to stay on a boat? 5/5, because I'd watch it over and over again. More like 4, but I'd watch it over and over again. I give it a 4/5. - Sophia4/5 - Thomas",Dr. No

I have my favourites of course, who wouldn't? The first mission for 007 leads him to Jamaica investigating Dr.No, a scientific genius set on destroying the United States Space Program. As this is my first Bond review, I wont bore you with the details you maybe familiar with such as beautiful locations, cars and girls. This film has it all as usual except it has no gadgets. These were introduced later on in the series. This is not the best adventure we have seen Bond involved with but as a first outing it is a must watch. Especially if you want to do the Bond challenge of watching all the films in order. For a film made in the 1960's, the visuals are still brilliant compared to later films. Overall I rated this film 7/10. This is because of the villain. I think that Dr.No is calculating, cold and a perfect match for Bond. If only his disability hadn't got in the way, there may have only been one Bond film.",Dr. No
402,danielstefulic-71531,"""I admire your luck, Mr...?"" ""Bond, James Bond.""",9,6 March 2017,"There it is, the movie that had started the legendary franchise in 1962, starting with ""Dr. No"".With the great direction of Terence Young and John Barry's soundtrack, we've been introduced into the franchise of the most famous British spy written by Ian Fleming.When a MI6 agent Strangways is murdered on Jamaica, M (Bernard Lee) sends his agent, James Bond (Sean Connery) to uncover the mystery of the murder and find out about the mysterious Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman), who works in a secret organization among known as SPECTRE. On his way, James will come across some interesting characters such as Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), Quarrel (John Kitzmiller), Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) and Professor Dent (Anthony Dawson), a geologist who secretly works for Dr. No.The movie itself is brilliantly made. The locations, set designs made by Ken Adam (with a budget of 1.1$ million!) and the cast was perfect. Sean Connery is without any doubt my favorite James Bond actor and in the movie you can see how much he's enjoying in acting. The dinner scene with Dr. No could be, among with Honey raising from the sea, my favorite as when James asks what SPECTRE is, his face says he's nailing the scene without any problem. Dr. No is an indeed interesting and menacing villain, but it's a shame he only got 10-15 minutes on- screen, despite the movie being named after him.Locations such as Jamaica and Crab Key are really fascinating, especially Crab Key (because of low budget), for which credit goes to Ken Adam, a set designer who'd provide the fascinating set designs throughout the movies.But let's not forget that iconic scene in the beginning when James Bond is introduced at last, saying: ""Bond... James Bond."". Some may say that this movie had risen Sean Connery into star, but in fact, it was From Russia With Love that had risen him into star. Actors such as Bernard Lee, who'd portray M all they way till Moonraker, does his role really well. Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny is the actress who nailed her character perfectly all the way till A View to a Kill. Interestingly, the movie doesn't have Desmond Llewelyn as a titular Q character, but instead it has Peter Burton, who only appeared in the beginning titled as Major Boothroyd for only once. Supporting cast such as Jack Lord and John Kitzmiller do their work really well and Kitzmiller's performance as Quarrel is memorable. Two Bond girls such as Eunice Gayson, who'd appear in FRWL, and Ursula Andress, are in this movie. Gayson was supposed to reprise her role for a few more movies, but it was ultimately scrapped. Andress is just so gorgeous as Honey Ryder which is unbelievable. Joseph Wiseman does a great work as Dr. No, if only he got more on- screen appearance. Of the other actors, Anthony Dawson'd re-appear in FRWL and Thunderball as Blofeld, albeit uncredited. Last, but not least important, Dr. No's guard, portrayed by Milton Reid (uncredited), would appear 15 years later in TSWLM.All in all, the movie itself was a really good beginning, but the better has to come yet!4.5 out of 5 stars.",Dr. No
403,thors-35709,Sean Connery off to a great start in the first James Bond movie,8,13 April 2020,"James Bond - Dr. No - 1962 8/10.This is the first movie in the long-running movie franchise of James Bond, introducing a very strong and handsome looking Sean Connery as the legendary British agent. Not the first James Bond on a screen though, Ian Flemings novel Casino Royal was already made as a live television adaptation for American television with Barry Nelson as an American CIA agent James Bond as early as 1954. It was not any good, thankfully the movie introduces us to the proper British agent we all came to admire and sets the standard for many years to come.
The plot : a British intelligence officer has gone missing in Jamaica while investigating American claims of radio control interference with their rocket launches from Cape Canaveral. James Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate, and becomes a target of an unknown and mysterious enemy named Dr. No. Teaming up with an American CIA agent named Felix Leitner, a local helper and the first of a long string of Bond girls, played by Ursula Andress, James Bond unravels the mystery and are for the first time introduced to the secretive organisation Spectre, in shape of the genious chinese mastermind Dr. No. In typical James Bond fashion, it all ends with a big bang.Some features of a classical James Bond movie are already present in this first movie, while some are not. We do get the legendary gun-barrel introduction scene, but in the first movies the agent in the gun barrel sight was stuntman Bob Simmons, not the actor playing Bond. This movie has no pre-credit action sequence, which otherwise later became one of the fixed ingredients in the James Bond movie recipe. And the credit/opening title sequence, even though it was designed by Maurice Binder from the first movie, is quite disapointing, featuring colored animated dots forming the title Dr. No and some silhouette dancers, and none of the scantily clad women seen in future title sequences. There is no memorable title song for this first Bond movie either. We do however get a very strong introduction to James Bond at a Casino with the famous exchange ""I admire your luck, mr. ? Bond. James Bond"", delivered by a very convincing Sean Connery, which comes across a man capable of making love to a woman and kill a guy moments later with no hesitation or remorse. So it's Sean Connerys portrayal of the more serious and dark James Bond that carries and saves this movie, with almost none of the word puns and sillyness of later movies (allthough we do get the puns
with Moneypenny). There are no Q deviced special agent gear either, all James Bond is equipt with is a Walther PPK instead of his usual Beretta.
Not all is well though. The movie plot is quite simple compared to later Bond movies, with almost all action taking place in a single location in Jamaica. The budget is low and it shows. The car chases are imbarrasing background projections, the movie is obviously dubbed, there are no memorable henchmen, the most imminemt threat to James Bond is a spider, and the villain introduced late in the movie as an etnic stereotype based on the Fu Manchu character, comes across as a rather unremarkable representative of the mysterious organisation Spectre, with the only motive for his ""topling"" action to prove Spectres power. The climatic sequence in the villains stronghold is over pretty fast, with James Bond - without the Bond girl which is held captured elsewhere - turning ancontrol wheel with a very large and helpful ""Danger Level"" meter into
the red zone, to ensure that the viewer grasps what is going on. Finding and saving the Bond girl, he makes his escape while the nice set (the exterior birds eye view of it does still look like a model) blows up. Even while it misses some of the ingredients we came to expect and love of a classic James Bond movie (the movies turned out to have their own life separate from the books), it's all in all a good start to the James Bond franchise by Sean Connery, let somewhat down by a simple plot, low budget and a technically quality of movie making that hasn't aged well.",Dr. No

410,professor_blah_blahson,Inspired,10,28 August 2005,"In order for Dr No to be truly appreciated, you have to see it for what it was when first released - it was a ground-breaking, one-of-a-kind, truly inspired film. Despite any poor special effects or slow cars or lack of gadgets, the greatness of this film lies in its being the first kind of film with an anti-hero as its central character, with a realistic setting in British intelligence. My argument is that the film must have been great for two reasons: a) had it been bad the rest of the Bond series would never have been made; b) there are huge numbers of bond-spoofs inspired by this and other early Bond films.The plot may be relatively simple and Bond may only be equipped with a Geiger counter and a gun, but this is many peoples' argument for its greatness - Bond is a relatively real spy, unlike any Bond films after and including Goldfinger (where he had gadgets galore and one of the best cars ever in a Bond film).In short, watch it if not for its quality or plot or excitement, but to see an inspired work of cinema.",Dr. No
411,RICHARDBLACK80,Bond Begins,7,22 September 2005,"The first but not the best of the bond movies. Still a good film though. Having recently sat through all the Bond films (I am Alan Partridge) this one now looks a little dated. Considering it was filmed in 1962 I suppose that is fair enough however when you look at From Russia With Love and Goldfinger apart from certain parts they don't look dated at all. Of course I'm being harsh here as its still a very good movie and Sean Connery makes a great start and is a really good Bond. In a way the Bond he plays in this and in From Russia with love is very different from the one he played between Goldfinger and You Only Live twice (the Bond he played in Diamonds are Forever was on auto pilot and doesn't count) he is a bit nasty in places which I think makes him a better Bond. Quality Bond girl, good baddie and great Bond ending. Advice to anyone who hasn't seen any of the Bond films and is about to, see the first two first and then watch the others in any order. Welcome to the world of Bond",Dr. No
412,emilgbruhn,My first Bond movie ever... And it was quite good!,7,2 June 2018,"As you can read, before now, I had never seen any Bond movies. I'm a movie fanatic, but I never got around to watch any of the Bond movies, so I decided that now would be as good a time as any.
If you're interested in my Bond-adventure, be sure to catch my reviews of each of the movies. I'll be writing reviews as I see the movies. So let's get into this movie...Pros:
I can see why this franchise is so popular. Sean Connery brings the character of James Bond wonderfully to life. The charm that Bond brings combined with his cleverness and smart moves, like breathing through a bamboo stick, leaves one unable to dislike him.
The action, suspense, Carribean atmosphere and the amazing soundtrack within this movie, is pretty unique and captivating, especially for it's time.
All these factors results in a simple but satisfying film.Cons:
The special effects are not the greatest, and nore are the sound effects, even if you do consider the fact that it's from 1962. This especially goes for the car chase scene, to name an example.
Also, some of the interactions feel very staged, and you can tell when somebody just remembered their lines in their head, and this especially goes for the character of Honey. In generel, Honey did not fit in that great, and they could definitely have fleshed her out better.
The 3rd act was all in all probably the worst part of the movie (remember, I'm not saying that it was bad, just that it was the worst part), mostly due to things seaming, well... staged.Conclusion:
All in all, this was a good simple action-thriller, and I especially really love Sean connery's peformance.
I'm certanly excited to watch the next one, and I'll be sure to drop a review on it.I'll give it 7.4 out of 10.",Dr. No
413,johnnytherealguy,Sensational but.,8,13 August 2019,"A very good film but not the best James Bond.This film is very good of course, but he might don't satisfy yourself as a James bond film.
Not a lot of explosion and impressive scenes.
Nothing in terms of "" gadget"".
And fight scenes are very exagerate.Despite this, Dr no is a film that when you are into it, you can't get your eyes away of the screen because Sean Connery Bond's interpretation is Sensational, because the film has a 60's style lot of charm and because of Bond's girls of course.And all this stuff makes the film a Must Watch.",Dr. No
414,andinodavidjr,The one that started it all,10,14 September 2020,"This was my dad's favorite movie and all his life he loved Connery era bond. He reads the ian Fleming books and he was an expert on the franchise. The plot, while a bit slow, has a bit of suspense and action.Honey Ryder, played by the lovely Ursula andress, is my favorite bond girl. The adventure is easy to follow and there are less gadgets than any bond film I saw.The music has reggae elements and bits of the first bond theme.All in all, I find it a great spy movie as it plays more like a mystery movie with a plot and Sean played it cool and he says in one of the coolest and often quotable lines ""my name is bond, James bond."" I give a ten as it was a great debut and he will return.",Dr. No
415,Sheelal,a great start to the longest-running movie franchise,8,5 October 2014,"The character of James Bond was first introduced in 1953 in the novel ""Casino Royale"" by Ian Fleming and afterward more novels were written and released by Fleming, the books became best sellers and in 1962 James Bond 007 makes his film debut in ""Dr. No"" The movie becomes a success and thus began the longest running film franchise in movie history. Based on the 6th novel of the same name. The movie was definitely a product of its time: during the Cold war, the early 1960s and spy thrillers in both movies and books, but James Bond was something else and unheard of. It was a fantasy with larger than life villains, exotic locations and beautiful women.The plot is fairly simple (as it was made on a budget of 1 million dollars) agent James Bond 007 of MI6 is sent to Jamaica to investigate the death of a fellow government agent which eventually leads Bond to the mysterious Dr. No and his plan for toppling the American missile system. Along the way he encounters allies, enemies and brushes with death.What can I say? The movie is definitely a classic and a product of its time. But there isn't as much action scenes as the later movies would have and that could be because of the lower budget for the time, some people may find the movie a bit boring in some places but its more of a spy thriller and it never fails to keep me interested or entertained. The dialogue is great, the sets by Ken Adam are stunning and the effects hold up fairly well today in my opinion. As for the acting? Sean Connery IS James bond and will always be the best, for his first performance as 007 he does a fantastic job in the role with a good mixture of sexiness, cold-killer, secret agent. The first introduction to Bond in the casino will always be one the most iconic introductions to any movie character ever and in my opinion holds up very well today. The rest of the cast is good also with Lois Maxwell and Bernard Lee as Monneypenny and M respectively playing roles that would last them for years.While the movie is a classic it does however have its flaws like for instance the editing in some places is a little dated, also the character of Honey Ryder isn't as developed or as interesting as some of the later bond girls we would have but as the first main bond girl Ursula Andress does a good job with what she is given. The titular Dr. No only shows up at the end and is really only in like two scenes however like Andress Joesph Wiseman does a good job and gives a very menacing and interesting performance, the dinner scene with him and Bond is very well acted. Unfortunately the ending does feel a little bit anticlimactic and tame compared to future installments.Overall Dr. No did a fantastic job introducing audiences to 007 and is still going 50 years later, while it may be a little dated, flawed and a little tame it was a great start the series 8/10",Dr. No
416,nebsmate,the movie that started it all,9,21 October 2007,"an instant spy classic.it reinvented the genre with an endless display of beautiful women,exotic locations,and slam bang action sequences.sean connery is perfect as bond,displaying wit as well as bing a ruthless secret agent.the storyline and the screenplay has far more depth than many other bonds, keeping the true essences of the flemming novels as well as creating a cinematic masterpiece. there is a colourful array of supporting characters-felix leiter,quarrel,honey ryder and not to forget the chilling villain-doctor no-.the movie is well thught out,with the story and characters all developing ,building up to a simply breathtaking finale.",Dr. No

418,ohmyhead,Short and Sweet,5,5 July 2005,"Having grown up on Roger Moore and the others that followed, I had not gotten a chance to see Connery's Bond. Entertaining enough, I suppose. But I have two nagging problems with this movie (that I am currently watching).No gadgets? Bond with no gadgets? Blah! And, I am watching this movie in a house with a sleeping roommate. I have worn out the volume control on my remote, constantly raising and lowering it. The dialog is all a near whisper, but the sound FX (car engines, boat engines, elevators, trays falling over, etc) are very LOUD!! And while I might seem to be being too picky, that kind of thing gives me a case of the red-ass. >:{ Remix/remaster anyone? I do like how he's rough with the ladies, smokes, and drinks like a champ.

419,Nbdmoore,Great start to the Bond Series!,7,30 May 2014,"Let me start out by saying I am completely new to the Bond series and wanted to start from the first movie released instead of going from best to last or in any other order.I enjoyed the beginning build of the story and the entrance of Mr. Bond, very classic and stylized. The characters from the small henchmen to Bond and his trademark ""eye candy"" were well crafted. The action scenes were short but great for its time and have aged well. The mystery surrounding the antagonist kept me very intrigued through it and I was on the edge of my seat until the end.As far as its short comings there are not that many but some that stuck with me and these are just personal gripes so please do not take them completely serious or stop you from enjoying this film. The main antagonist did not have enough story behind him that I felt he was a massive threat. Also, the conflict between them both isn't chopped and served throughout the movie, it will start and end within the last 15-20 minutes which I wish there was more to it.All in all, a few small gripes does not destroy the symbolism, characters or plot of this gem of a film. Do yourself a favor, watch and enjoy!",Dr. No
420,charlesrabone,Blueprint,5,15 April 2018,"So Dr No is the first of the bonds( discounting David Nivens outing ) and therefore sets the Bluprint for the rest, which now covers the span of nearly 56 years to date. 
Your can't review this movie without showing some empathy towards the era it was made .
It provided the audience at that time the chance of escapism, to enjoy the glamor and glamorous locations, it was easier to stimulate the senses, where now in a modern era we all have the accessibility to travel far and wide to these locations and we have more gadgets now, than any bond has had in the past. 
Where good over came evil and the guy got the girl. That's not to say the women in this film are weak characters and just fell over for Mr Bond as in other films of the series . They all had strong characters from the British operative in our Colonial island of Jamaica... which just happened to be in its last year, Jamaica became independent a couple of months before the film was released .... to the lady of distinction at the roulette table, who got her man. To the ruthless double agent with the Charlie Chan make over ... and nobody was going to argue with Ursula with a knife in her hand (not worth the handcuffs , I think not boys ). This bond is more like the current bond ( 2018) , no gadgets required , his cool as a cucumber until his up against incy wincy. 
The plot, the set, and the Villain, you can't criticise, as it's the first of the series , but I have given this 5 stars to give the other films a higher or lower rating in the series against this benchmark. The picture restoration by Laury is as much a benchmark for HD as the film. With rich colours and sharpness that makes it look like a modern film and in the world of 4K and some , you can probably see this film now better than the audiences of 62.
I haven't said anything about the sound, as clearly restoration from the original source was going to be limited, and is expressed in the low quality of the HD spread through 5 speakers. But it's clear as a birds whistle.
Turn the phone off, roll down the blinds and enjoy.",Dr. No
421,angel-99,Lacks action and full of obvious flaws.,2,4 July 1999,"Dr. No lacks the usual action and excitement of other Bond films.   The movie starts out slow and drags through the whole show.  Obvious flaws such as,  when they arrive at Dr. No's house they are told that they were waiting for them, but they had no idea she was on the island.   When James Bond (Sean Connery) pours the coffee, Ursula takes a sip, but does not swallow, then her cup is empty.  Sean Connery (Bond) also take a one drink of coffee, he also does not swallow, but after one sip both cups are empty and dry. The passing out scene is poor.  When Jack Lord comes across the boat adrift at the end of the show he calls out Bond's name, but he can not see Bond, nor did he even know if Bond escaped or how, as no one was present when they escaped the island and they had no means of communication.",Dr. No

425,samuelmiller1,The start of the greatest film franchise of all time,7,6 June 2009,"Dr. No, the first of 22 James bond films was released in 1962 and directed by Terence Young. Based on Ian Fleming's 1958 novel this spy thriller does not follow the typical James bond formula with the gadgets and far fetched characters and plots. All in all this film isn't anything special, Sean Connery debuts as agent 007 with suave sophisatication and Joseph Wiseman proves to be a worthy adversary for the secret agent.The 5 things I LIKE about this film: 1) Sean Connery, the man that made agent 007 a household name plays the part like no other man on the planet could, his seamless performance adds to the film's credibility and looks as if he has been playing the part for years. No other actor has beaten his performance since 2) The best bond girl ever, Ursula Andress is sizzling as Honey Ryder and sets the standard for future bond girls.3) The use of the classic James Bond Theme. Monty Norman's simple yet effective theme is used in the titles sequence and as a recurrent motif when Bond is on the screen. It is a shame that future bond films have strayed away from using this classic theme.4) The line Bond James Bond is first pronounced by Connery and is the definite highlight of this film, you feel a shiver down your spine when he delivers this famous one liner.5) The villain Dr. No, Although not in the film a lot and not a dominant screen time character. His presence is certainly felt throughout the film building the suspense in the final showdown with Bond.Five things that I HATED about this film; 1) The gunshots and sound effects in this film are appalling and are certainly the worst of the entire series, luckily the film-makers redeemed themselves in later films by incorporating far more believable sound effects.2) The character of Sylvia Trench, this character is unnecessary and I was glad that the idea of her character hooking up with bond before he sets off before each escapade was dropped after From Russia with Love.3)The locations, having only one location in this film (Jamaica) certainly lessens the scale of the whole piece and sets the story in just one country which makes the film less interesting as in later films the tradition is that Bond travels around the world to pursue his adversary/s 4) The idea of the ""Dragon"" on Crab key, this is just lame and stupid, the idea of a dragon on a remote island sounds good but the way it is executed in the film is absolutely pathetic and I woudn't be surprised if Connery himself would have laughed at the idea whilst reading the script or filming the specific scene.5) Finally, the thing I hate most about this film is the dubbing of certain characters. (eg. Honey Ryder, John Strangways) why couldn't they just leave them as they were? It looks second rate and certainly lowers the films overall performance.My rating of this film is 7/10, not the best bond film ever but certainly set the series off to a good start with the critics and fans alike.",Dr. No
426,Deathrace4000,"Not the Best Bond Movie, but it's Up There!",9,26 July 2008,"It's funny how, with all the glitz and glamor that every Bond movie up to Casino Royale has heaped upon us, that we forget what gritty background Bond movies have.As I mentioned in the title, this is not my favorite Bond movie (that honor would have to go to Goldfinger), but this one is easily third (second is On Her Majesty's Secret Service in my mind)! However, this is the best Bond book, and it makes a great movie!What strikes me about this movie is how easily it could have been an episode of something like ""Mission: Impossible"". It's not nearly as fantasized as some other James Bond movies; in fact, I think the closest this movie comes to the fantastic realm is with Dr. No's hands, about which I will not say more for fear of releasing plot details. In fact, I think that that is one of the things I enjoy most about it, the fact that Bond, in this movie, could almost be any one of us.I was also struck by the fact that this film was almost shot like a documentary in some scenes, really quick and dirty. It looks more like something that one might expect from ""The French Connection"" or, coming even closer, ""Hawaii Five-O"" than one might expect to see in a Bond film.Well, I could go on forever about all the magnificent aspects of this film, such as the performances, direction, etc., but it suffices me to say that this is one of the best Bond movies and comes very highly recommended from me!",Dr. No
427,n-young9504,James Bond still has it after 50 years,9,7 September 2011,I'm gonna start watching and reviewing some of the movies I have. First let me say this doesn't have spoilers but just in case ill check the spoiler alert. I decided to watch Dr. No for easily the 20th time the other night. It still draws me in and keeps me entertained for the entire movie. Sean Connery is easily the best Bond and I loved how they introduced him. This movie is well paced and I think has the right amount of action. Bond is a lot grittier than he is in the others especially in one scene where he shot a man in cold blood. The movie does look and feel a little dated but it should because its almost 50 years old. One of my favorite scenes is James crawling through the vents. The only thing missing from this movie is the gadgets. But I loved seeing him work without relying on them so much. Dr. No will always be one of my favorite villains. I'm going to try to watch the rest of the movies in order. I hope to review them all as well as other movies I own.,Dr. No

What i love about Dr No is the mystery plot, bond kinda operates as a detective finding out things as the film moves along and so do we.From the introduction scene, to Mr Dent being killed, to Honey Ryder coming out of the sea, and last but not least the Dinner scene with Doctor No (which in my opinion is the best scene in the entire movie) it is all so classic stuff.Also Sean Connery in this movie, man that guy has charm. The way he delivers some of his lines is absolutely amazing. I absolutely love when he tries to put Dent under pressure by asking if the samples was from: ""Crab Key perhaps"". And when the receptionist at Dr No lair says he's dressed quite suitable and he says: ""Suitable for what""?",Dr. No
430,adamevans2214,bond begins,7,26 January 2015,"So 007 now the most iconic character in cinema begins here in 1962 in the film, namely Dr No. To start with its not the best of the bunch and revelations now seeming outrageous that the film was low budget don't seem all that shocking after viewing. Most apparent is the repetitive soundtrack which drives me crazy when watching despite it not being bad. So why the success?Lets begin with the premise. This is a spy movie about Americas space program. How contemporary do you want to get? The cold war was in fifth gear by 1962 so the idea of espionage created a great deal of intrigue. The character of 'the spy' just needed a face. So bond gave it to them. More to the point, Connery gave it to them. Connery plays the part of the suave secret agent with a sense of danger to perfection. Connery is a big man and its believable he can handle himself. Like i said, Dr No is not a great film and as such i attribute a huge part of its success to its leading man. Bond played by Connery is somebody men want to be and women want to be with. It's difficult not to be in awe of the secret agent who lives a fast life drinking smoking and having sex with amazing women. Connery is the most human of all Bonds and to see him sweating over a tarantula at one point is refreshing when having seen the ridiculous later installments where the fear factor has gone. Ursula Andress is the eye candy Bond Girl here and her entrance on screen is unforgettable. I think I've given off the impression i don't like the film with the exception of Connery and Andress but that's not true. I actually do like that on a low budget a 'grounded' film has been made with Bond following up inquiry with contacts in Jamaica. Its rather fitting that Dr No insults Bond later in the film by calling him a 'stupid policeman'. Okay so Bond is certainly not stupid but its definitely not too far off the mark to use the term policeman given his line of inquiry sees him acting as private detective. The film is filmed in interesting locations the general public would simply not be privy to creating a sense of escapism into the glamorous world of Bond, which fifty years later still fascinates Bond fans. All in all a steady start to Bond but things get better. I'll be reviewing all the Bond titles in time so stay tuned.",Dr. No
431,ewking_mob,"""You've had your six.""",9,30 October 2005,"While not a strict adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel, Dr. No- along with its successor, From Russia With Love- is one of the few James Bond films to capture the essence of Fleming's James Bond. Bond is a hardened, unrepentant killer, bereft of ridiculous gadgets and gimmicks. Also worth noting is Jack Lord's Felix Leiter. Fleming's Leiter (who was not even in the original Dr. No novel) was a more eccentric and humorous character than Lord's, but at least Leiter is presented as a contemporary of Bond's; a man who's got Bond's back, just as he did in Fleming's novels. Lord is vastly superior to the later inferior, unmemorable Leiters, starting with Cec Linder's ridiculous ""Uncle Felix"" in Goldfinger.Forget EON's hollow promises of a return to the grittiness and realism of Fleming for their version of Casino Royale; this flawed but earnest effort, along with From Russia With Love, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and Licence to Kill is very likely the closest we'll ever get to seeing Fleming's Bond on screen.

432,jakemorganyt,Where it all started.,7,28 December 2016,"This is the film that launched the James Bond series. And my god it launched it well.First of all Sean Connery is easily best Bond in my opinion closely followed by Daniel Craig. This is highlighted in this film with his charm, wit and humor. Ursula Andress is a great Bond girl as well with good chemistry with Connery and also being very beautiful. As well as all these things the film is well for the majority of the film with solid direction.However, the main problem with the film is near the end when Bond is escaping it is really stupid the way he escapes and makes the villain look quite dumb considering he as shown as scientific genius.Overall, it is a great film and should be watched by everyone even though the ending is a bit disappointing it is a fun thrill ride everyone",Dr. No

434,seaotterpups,There is definitely something I don't get,3,13 March 2018,"I'm watching a few James Bond movies for a term paper I'm writing about Spy Fiction and since Dr. No marks the beginning of the most influential espionage movie franchise in history it was definitely a must see for me. I was not impressed, to say the least.First of all I'm not a James Bond fan. I'm not much of an action movie fan either, but once in a while I watch one and there's a few I like, so it's not that I am completely opposed to the genre, but take my review with a grain of salt.If you're a fan of James Bond movies in general, this is your movie. It's the normal Bond formula with several pretty girls by his side, an investigation with some action that sooner or later leads to the villain and then the defeat of said villain. If that's your thing, totally do consider this movie. It is great if you can turn off your brain for two hours and just want to be entertained. If you can't do that, don't pick up this movie. If you expect something deep James Bond just isn't your thing and that's completely fine. Different people have different tastes. I for one don't really like it.I guess I can handle the weird decisions such as Bond breaking into the air vent in his prison cell with a shoe but somehow that air vent also connects to a water pipe (I feel like I totally missed something here, someone please explain that scene to me), but what really destroyed my enjoyment was the Bond girl Honey Ryder.Bond usually has several love interests just like in this movie. I don't like it, but fine, I don't expect much. That's just James Bond and I bet a lot of people enjoy this and that's cool. But Honey Ryder... She's special. Special because she's somehow really stupid. She talks in this little girl way that made me uncomfortable throughout the whole movie and she's depicted as not much more than that. A naive little girl in the body of a hot blonde (I actually found out through my research that they chose the actress pretty much because the one they actually wanted to use wasn't ""voluptuous"" enough on screen). There's several instances where they show her as explicitly being stupid and honestly I couldn't look past this and I really can't understand why so many people see her as the best Bond girl when we get girls with actual agency like Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale from 2006.
When Honey gets taken away by Dr. No's guards she is wearing pants. Later when Bond rescues her she's only in her bikini panties. I don't want to think about those implications to be honest.",Dr. No
