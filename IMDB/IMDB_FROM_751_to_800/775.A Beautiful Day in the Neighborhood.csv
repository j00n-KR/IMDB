0,MartinHafer,Very intelligently crafted....just make sure you have some Kleenex nearby!,9,8 May 2020,"I should warn you about ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"", the film might be difficult for some viewers. This is because the story is about a troubled relationship between a man and his father...and it may trigger a lot of personal issues for you as well. Now I am NOT saying don't watch it....just be prepared that it might just be tough for you if you are struggling with these sorts of personal issues. And, you might want to have some Kleenex nearby...and perhaps a loved one as well.
The story is not a biopic about Fred Rogers...though he is a major player in the story. Instead, it's a nice story about a reporter who has daddy issues....and his encounters with Rogers did a lot to change his life. At first, they met so that he could write a magazine article about Rogers...but they became friends during this process and Rogers had a huge impact on his life.The acting and writing are great. Perhaps even better is the direction and script...they are marvelous and it sure shows as you watch this touching movie. Overall, a really effective and terrific story...one you will no doubt enjoy.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
1,SnoopyStyle,slam-dunk casting,7,29 March 2021,"Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) is a cynical investigative reporter at Esquire. He has acquired a reputation for takedown pieces on his subjects. His editor assigns him a puff piece on American icon Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks). He is not thrilled and he is holding on to his lifelong anger at his father Jerry Vogel (Chris Cooper).It's a slam-dunk to cast Tom Hanks for the role of Fred Rogers. I've never actually seen the show and I can see the easy comparison. It's an obvious choice. The question is what to do with the rest of the story. As the movie says itself, the article is more about Lloyd than Mr. Rogers. This movie is more about Lloyd than Mr. Rogers. As such, a lot of this relies on Rhys' performance and giving the struggle a realism. All of that is there but it doesn't fill me with wonder. It should be more of a tearjerker. More than anything, this feels like spending time with a psychiatrist or a priest while working out personal issues. I try to imagine a way to make this more compelling. It's hard. In a way, Rhys is playing Lloyd in a too obvious manner. He looks like sh14 which reflects directly from his insides. If he could start out pulled together, he could deteriorate as he is forced to confront his anger towards his father. I also think that it's unfair to put that picture of Lloyd up there. Again, it's very on the nose. I do like his character growth. I just want to feel it more.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
2,Hitchcoc,A Bit Manipulative,8,15 March 2020,"Since I already knew the movie was about a cynical writer for Esquire, I can't use the excuse I was ambushed. I thought Hanks did a wonderful job portraying the iconic man. He must have examined tons of film to get the mannerisms correct. Still, it was slow moving and too predictable. I always like Chris Cooper and he was good in a limited part. Two good scenes. One on a subway. The other as the family sits in the sick man's home and Fred shows up. I think that maybe people's expectations were a bit to high. It is a decent movie.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
3,boblipton,You Can Choose To See This Movie,7,24 November 2019,"I'm still grumpy over the documentary about Fred Rogers, WON'T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR? not even being nominated for best documentary, but I chose to see this movie anyway. It stars Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers. The story is based on an ESQUIRE article by Tom Junod called ""Cab You Say 'Hero'?"" in which the usual expose-writing writer is told to interview Fred Rogers. Matt Rhys, who plays the writer, finds the affair....unsettling. He's looking to rip the amiable mask off the fellow, but finds him a quiet, sharp man who seems to have done his own research on the writer and picks, picks, picks at the fellow until he winkles out his issues. He quietly denies being a saint, admits to being an imperfect parent, who, his wife notes, has a terrible temper. Everyone, however, is incredibly vague and protective. Rhys keeps trying to find the joint between the public mask and the face beneath, and winds up learning a lot about himself.The choices of what to leave out are interesting. Fred Rogers was an ordained Presbyterian minister who used the TV show as a non-denominational pulpit to address children and their issues. He was the most unlikely of TV stars and his show was filmed in the most awkward of manners, yet parents knew that their children were safe with him, even as he expressed his love for everyone and discussed disturbing subjects.This is best summed up in the sequence where Rhys is asked to meet Rogers in New York. They take the subway to his Manhattan apartment, and are serenaded by his theme song by a carful of children, Black teenagers, cops and young adults.Hanks gives a fascinating performance. He lets you see that Mr. Rogers is indeed a public mask that he never lets slip... when anyone else is around. The way he slips around the interviewer's question to question the interviewer, shows at once a great intelligence, real concern for his fellow human being, and fear of something dark within himself.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
4,Prismark10,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,6,22 January 2020,"Director Marielle Heller follows up the darker cynical, Can You Ever Forgive Me with a more sweeter lighter story. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a fictionalised story of a children's television presenter's encounter with a journalist burdened with family issues.Set in 1998, Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) is bruised after a fight with his dad Jerry (Chris Cooper) at a wedding reception. Lloyd a cynical journalist has been sent by his editor to do a puff piece on beloved entertainer Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks.)Lloyd is more used to cynically taking down his subjects. Here he finds that Rogers is getting Lloyd to face his long standing issues with his father who ran out of his family.This is a slight movie but I did find Lloyd's journey touching. I can understand his anger, after all his father left his mother when she fell seriously ill.I knew nothing about Fred Rogers. I can sense for Hanks this was an Oscar bait and he did get a best supporting actor nomination. It could so easily been a corny film but it retains its charm.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
5,nogodnomasters,How people make a magazine,7,6 December 2019,"This is more of a biopic of Esquire writer Tom Junod, fictionalized as Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys). Lloyd had issues with anger. His interview with Mr. Rogers (Tom Hanks) proved therapeutic. Having watched the documentary on Fred Rogers, I was not overly taken by Hank's performance. The film was interesting but not overpowering. In a year of weak nominations, it could win some awards.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
6,classicsoncall,"""There is always something you can do with the mad that you feel.""",7,26 August 2020,"I'm sure I'm not the only person who expected something different from a movie titled ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"". In fact, when the picture started and got into the story of journalist Tom Junod, represented as Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), I thought I was watching the wrong picture. But as it moved on, the story did proceed to demonstrate the kindness and compassion of the long time children's television show host, known as Mr. Rogers (Tom Hanks). I was particularly impressed with the way Mr. Rogers handled his interviews by Vogel, who's questions were designed to provoke a negative response. Fred always managed to turn things around by becoming the interviewer himself, and gently forcing Vogel to confront the issues in his own life. I was already in my late teen years when 'MisteRogers Neighborhood' came on the air, and even though it was on a long time, I only ever caught a stray snippet of it while changing channels. I can't say for certain if I missed out on the experience, after all, I had Captain Kangaroo and Buffalo Bob on the case as a kid. But if some of the other reviewers on this site who experienced Mr. Rogers first hand found him to be an inspiration in their own lives, I would have to believe he was a most kind and gracious human being.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
7,lee_eisenberg,we must carry on with our lives,8,15 February 2021,"I vaguely remember seeing a few episodes of ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" when I was little, but wasn't old enough to fully understand it. As the years went by, long after I had stopped watching it, I learned more about it, and who Fred Rogers was.""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is not a biography of Rogers, but rather a look at his show's impact and his relations with people. What I took from it is the contrast between Rogers's world and ours. His show was all about friendship and a willingness to acknowledge one's feelings, while we experience a cynical existence outside. The only thing that we can do is try to make the best of things.Tom Hanks does an excellent job as Rogers. The cast also includes Matthew Rhys (The Americans), Susan Kelechi Watson (This Is Us) and Chris Cooper.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
8,jboothmillard,A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood,5,10 February 2020,"The only thing I found confusing about the nominated actor in this Awards Season contender was that he is the leading name of the cast, but he was nominated as supporting actor, but actually he is not the main character, so I guess that's fair enough. To be honest, it's only because of these awards nominations I wanted to see the film, otherwise I didn't know much about it at all, directed by Marielle Heller (Can You Ever Forgive Me?). Based on the true story, in 1998, Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) is an award-winning but cynical journalist for Esquire magazine. He attends the wedding of his sister Lorraine (Tammy Blanchard), along with his wife Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson), and their new-born son, Gavin. During the reception, Lloyd starts a fistfight with his estranged father Jerry (Chris Cooper), he is angry that his father abandoned his mother. The next day, Lloyd's editor Ellen (Christine Lahti) assigns him to interview pre-school children's television host and personality Fred Rogers (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Tom Hanks) for a 400-word article about heroes, although other potential heroes have turned down an interview by him. Lloyd travels to the WQED studio in Pittsburgh to interview Rogers. During the interview, Rogers is dismissive of his fame and displays concern for Lloyd's nose injury from the fight. This prompts Lloyd into a discussion about the issue of his relationship with his father, whose apology and attempt at reconciliation Lloyd has dismissed. Lloyd is convinced Rogers puts on a persona of being overly nice, he is determined to expose it as an act. He watches Rogers during the recording of several episodes of his show, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, but he cannot discern anything. Lloyd interviews Rogers again when he visits New York. During the interview, Rogers dodges Lloyd's questions and reminisces about raising his two sons. Fred takes out his puppets and asks Lloyd about a childhood stuffed animal and his father, provoking Lloyd into ending the interview. Lloyd arrives home to find Jerry and his girlfriend Dorothy (Wendy Makkena) there talking with Andrea. Lloyd argues with Jerry about him cheating on his mother Lila (Jessica Hecht) while she was dying of cancer. He orders him to leave, but Jerry suffers a heart attack and is taken to hospital. Lloyd refuses to remain with his father and the rest of the family at the hospital and returns to Pittsburgh to see Rogers. Exhausted, Lloyd collapses on the set of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe and dreams about his repressed childhood trauma. In his dream, Lloyd has turned into his childhood rabbit toy, shrunken to the size of puppets Daniel Striped Tiger and King Friday XIII, Rogers and Andrea are larger than him, and the spirit of Lila urges him to release his anger. Rogers and his wife Joanne (Maryann Plunkett) bring Lloyd to their home to recuperate. Lloyd and Rogers later go to a restaurant, they have a meaningful conversation, during which Rogers encourages him to forgive his father. Lloyd apologises to Andrea for leaving her and Gavin at the hospital, and visits Jerry and Dorothy at their home. Jerry is dying of a prolonged illness, which is why has tried to reconnect with his son. Lloyd forgives Jerry, promises to be a better father to Gavin, and writes an article about how Rogers has had an impact on his life. Lorraine and her husband Todd (Noah Harpster) visit Jerry, and they are all surprised when Rogers comes to visit also. Jerry visits a short time later, while Lloyd writes a 10,000-word article about Rogers, titled ""Can You Say ... Hero?"", which is published as the Esquire cover story. At his studio, Rogers films the final take of an episode of his show before playing the piano at end of another day of production. Also starring Enrico Colantoni as Bill Isler and Daniel Krell as Mr. McFeely. Rhys is indeed the leading character, as the troubled journalist pushed to an emotional brink but helped by this seemingly overly kind-hearted celebrity, while Hanks probably is the right actor to play the real-life beloved TV icon, but his wholesome good-natured personality borders the line of creepy. To be honest, the whole film is rather weird, it makes something of a good point about opening up, but the tone and style is strange, almost cringing at times, it is not for everyone, I personally think it is overrated by critics, but it is a reasonable biographical drama. Worth watching!",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
9,BA_Harrison,Roy? Kenny? Buck?,4,9 December 2019,"If you live anywhere other than America, you're probably asking 'Who the hell is Mr. Rogers?'.According to Wikipedia, Fred Rogers was a much-loved children's TV presenter in the US, whose show, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, ran between 1968 and 2001, teaching young children how to deal with emotional and physical concerns. I live in the UK and had never heard of the bloke until now, which made this already somewhat bizarre film about a rather unusual man even more of a surreal experience.Tom Hanks stars as Fred, who by all accounts was about as amiable a person as you would ever be likely to meet. Emotionally troubled magazine journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), who has a reputation for writing scathing articles, is given an assignment to interview Mr. Rogers, but thanks to his genial subject's understanding nature, he learns more about himself than he does the loveable TV star. As a result of his emotional awakening, Lloyd is able to patch up his relationship with his dying father Jerry (Chris Cooper).Using Rogers' saccharine show as the launchpad for events, this film begins in offbeat territory with the introduction of Vogel via a picture board, and continues in this rather weird vein throughout, with quirky model city interludes, a freaky dream sequence in which Vogel becomes his old toy rabbit, a bizarre 'one minute silence' in a Chinese restaurant, and a strangely disturbing scene in which Rogers introduces the journalist to his puppets. To be honest, if it hadn't been for these more idiosyncratic moments, I would have been quite bored, for the familial drama is trite and rather predictable, while Hanks' deliberate performance, as accurate as it may be, quickly outstays its welcome.I'm guessing that those who have rated this film a 9/10 or more are all Americans of a certain age, who have allowed nostalgia to affect their judgement. My more objective rating would be 4/10.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
10,tavm,Tom Hanks does another fine portrayal of a real-life person in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,9,12 December 2019,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were pretty enthralled by the way Tom Hanks portrayed the late kid show host Fred Rogers. It concerns Mister Rogers and his relationship with a reporter for Esquire magazine who's going through a rough patch when they meet. Now this reporter's name is changed for the movie so some of the events are dramatized for effect. Still, it's quite touching what is depicted on screen especially when Hanks as Rogers appears. Those silent pauses that happens throughout many scenes are also effective. I think I said enough so I'll just say I and my friend highly recommend A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
11,BandSAboutMovies,Life changing,10,31 December 2019,"I'm really emotional about the town that I come from, Pittsburgh. When people talk down on it or proclaim how they can't wait to get out of here, I get upset. There's nothing like this city to me and nowhere I go in the rest of this world can really measure up.A Rick Sebak documentary can bring me to tears. And watching the trailer for this movie, I realized that I'd probably be moved for its entire running time.I mean, how can you not love Pittsburgh, a city that has given you the 1970's Steelers, probably the roughest gang of brutes that ever took the gridiron; Bruno Sammartino, perhaps the greatest pro wrestler of all time; and also Fred Rodgers, a man who gently helped several generations grow up?Tom Junod started writing for Esquire in 1997, with some of his notable works including The Abortionist, The Rapist Says He's Sorry and The Falling Man, which was turned in to a documentary. His Esquire profile of Mister Rogers, ""Can You Say ... Hero?"", was the basis for this movie, written by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster (who also teamed to write Maleficent: Mistress of Evil).It's directed by Marielle Heller, who created the films The Diary of a Teenage Girl and the Lee Israel biopic Can You Ever Forgive Me?Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) is the award-winning Esquire journalist in this story who stands in for Junod. Recently in The Atlantic, Junod wrote about the differences between reality and the film. He never got in a fistfight with his father at his sister's wedding. You should read that article, marvel at how well-written it is, then come back to read my poor by comparison thoughts on this film. You can also see more of what is true and false in this Slate article.Tom Hanks plays Rogers and if there's anyone else that should imbue this role, I don't know who it could be. I traveled over an hour to see Mr. Rogers at the age of seven, so excited to be near him. He was just a constant moment of my childhood and there comes a time when we grow past our childhood, in the same way that Lloyd has forgotten his stuffed childhood friend Old Rabbit.To be honest, I needed to hear from Fred Rogers and consider what his message can still mean today, in a world where anger is the only thing sustaining me most days. I forget all the wonderful things that exist in the world, whether they're as simpler as an Italian direct to video horror movie or the love you get from your wife. This movie succeeds because it imparts that message without feeling preachy. These things just are. You are special, as Mister Rogers told me nearly forty years ago and like that stuffed rabbit that the writer has forgotten, I've forgotten too.This movie will mean something somewhere else, but it reminds me again of why I love Pittsburgh. Why this city makes me so emotional that my eyes grow wet. Because it's a place that built things at one point. Maybe it was the steel in skyscrapers. Perhaps it was the birthplace of someone like Warhol. Or maybe it was the home to someone like Mister Rogers, who took his Neighborhood of Make-Believe and sent it into our homes and tried to get us ready for the world that would come once he was gone.It's a dark and frightening place, if I can be perfectly honest with you. There are days where I can't control the shaking in my body because I get so nervous and worried and unable to decide what to do that I have no recourse other than to just shake.Maybe I should meditate further on this quote from Rogers: ""As human beings, our job in life is to help people realize how rare and valuable each one of us really is, that each of us has something that no one else has - or ever will have - something inside that is unique to all time. It's our job to encourage each other to discover that uniqueness and to provide ways of developing its expression.""I don't have any of the answers. But I'm trying. And that's the best we can do. You should see this movie, obviously.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
12,studioAT,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,8,17 June 2020,"This didn't get much of a theatrical run here in the UK, and possibly gets lost in translation, as we don't really know much about Mr Rogers, whereas in the US he is a massive icon from people's childhoods.On it's own merits though this is a good film, with two stellar performances from Rhys and Hanks.A little slow in places, it does contain some wonderful messages, that stayed with me long after the credits rolled.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
13,writers_reign,Here Comes The Neighbourhood,8,24 February 2020,"I may be one of the few people who had no idea who Rogers was which extends, of course, to his media shows. All I could think of based on the title was an old Gary Cooper film (which I never actually saw) called Good Neighbour Sam, in which Cooper presumably traded on his 'nice guy' real life image. Tom Hanks seems to be cornering the current market as the poor mans' Jack Lemmon though Lemmon is of course the one they all have to beat in the basic decency department. Again the true story of an unlikely friendship between an entertainer and a non-entertainer mirrors, to a certain extent, the bond between Jazz musician Bud Powell and a French jazz fan which was fictionalized in Bertrand Taverniers' Round Midnight in which pianist Powell was transformed into a saxophonist. Despite the saccharine elements the film is ultimately moving and erll made.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
14,grantss,Interesting and emotional film,7,27 September 2020,"Cynical, jaded investigative journalist Lloyd Vogel gets an assignment he feels is beneath him: interview and write a short article on the much-loved children's TV personality Fred Rogers. Vogel is battling his own demons, not least of which is a long-running animosity towards his father, going back to when his mother died.An interesting and emotional journey, though not without flaws. Starts off quite disappointingly and unengagingly. The reason to watch this film is to learn more about Fred Rogers and what makes him so endearing and great and, as importantly, see Tom Hanks play him. Yet from the outset the film concentrates on Lloyd Vogel whose story is not as interesting.However, from a point the plot starts to take shape and Fred Rogers starts to feature more. Tom Hanks is superb as Fred Rogers, imbuing him with a wonderful kindness and simple yet profound insights on life. This results in every scene involving Mr Rogers being absolutely riveting and leaving you hanging on every word. Wonderful, engaging, emotional stuff.However, Mr Rogers is not the main character. Indeed it is Vogel (played by Matthew Rhys of 'The Americans' fame) who is the centre of attention, which, to an extent, is unfortunate. The story involving him, the resentment towards his father, is fairly interesting and there is an arc to his character which is great to behold. However, the plot development is quite predictable and the best moments, once again, come when Mr Rogers is involved. The inbetween stuff is okay but hardly riveting or original.All this creates an uneven, two-speed movie: the delightful passages where Mr Rogers/Hanks is involved, the more ordinary stretches when not.Overall, a good, emotional movie. It could have been brilliant though.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
15,Calicodreamin,Unexpected,7,1 December 2019,"Not a straightforward biopic, instead telling the story of Mr. Rogers through his ability to help a reporter work through issues with his father.

17,view_and_review,I'm Still Getting Advice From Mr. Rogers,7,24 November 2019,"It was a movie about Mr. Rogers so how could I not go see it? From birth until about the age of ten Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street were my primary T.V. programs. Sure, they were supplemented at times by Reading Rainbow, Romper Room, and other PBS shows, but Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street were the staples.I was expecting a biopic but we got something a little different. Instead of a movie about Mr. Rogers' life from beginning to end, we got a vignette about Mr. Rogers' positive affect on a journalist named Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys).This movie is more suited for those of us that grew up watching Mr. Rogers. Not that younger viewers can't appreciate the movie, but there won't be the same connection. The moment I saw the low resolution camera shot of his set I felt warm and comfortable as though I was child again watching Mr. Rogers in the comfort of my living room. The nostalgic effect it had on me was worth the price of admission.The movie moves slow and the conflict in it is tame when compared to other dramas, but potential viewers can be comfortable in knowing that this movie does nothing to sully the good name of Mr. Rogers. If anything, this movie will give viewers a better feeling about the soft spoken sage. There are some humorous moments and some deep moments, but I think every moment was a teaching moment. So, now at age 40+ I found myself listening to the soothing monotone wisdom of Mr. Rogers through the voice of Tom Hanks.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
18,evanston_dad,Captures the Essence of Mr. Rogers,7,20 April 2020,"""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is not a biopic of Fred Rogers, and for that we can be thankful. It's not really about him at all, but rather is about a misanthropic writer with serious anger issues (played by Matthew Rhys) who is assigned to profile Fred Rogers for an ""Esquire"" magazine series on American heroes. What he finds is a man who he instantly distrusts as being too good to be true, someone who's kind, forgiving, and at peace with himself and the world, all of the things Ryhs's character isn't. As played by Tom Hanks, Rogers becomes more of a supernatural presence in the film rather than a flesh and blood character. He remains enigmatic to both Rhys and the audience, more therapist than interview subject, asking more questions than he answers, a gentle and calming presence, much like he was for millions of children for years on television.I found myself sharing many of the protagonist's feelings throughout the course of the movie, the predominant one being: Is this guy for real? But that made me sad about myself and about the world, because I have to believe many others who watch this movie will also feel the same way, and what does that say about humanity, that it's so hard to believe true kindness and goodness exists when we come across it?I liked this film more in retrospect than I did while I was in the middle of watching it. Rhys is quite good, while Hanks gives what I think is actually a quite complicated performance while making it look simple. He doesn't try to imitate Fred Rogers as much as capture the quality about him that enraptured a generation, and he does that admirably, justifying the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination he received for this film.Grade: A-",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Mr Rogers and his kind sympathetic look and saintly vibe helped him to heal the rift with his father. There isn't quite enough story for a movie here. Tom Hanks looks a bit fatter and older than Mr Rogers. Matthew Rhys plays the tormented journalist well. Tom Hanks does give off a saintly vibe and it is quite moving in parts.

22,gradyharp,'Anything mentionable is manageable',7,5 June 2020,"Mister Rogers (Fred McFeely Rogers - March 20, 1928 - February 27, 2003) is known to everyone - whether as a memory from childhood, or a memory from the childhood of our children or grandchildren. The Mister Rogers' Neighborhood preschool television series ran from 1968 - 2001 and was a rather profound influence on teaching children's emotional and physical concerns such as death, school enrollment, divorce, sibling rivalry, self esteem, dealing with anger - and puppets, friendship and songs of entertainment.This film is based on a true story about a relationship between Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks) and jaded magazine journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys). Vogel is assigned to write a profile of Fred Rogers by his editor Ellen (Christine Lahti), and despite his dread of the assignment, with support from his wife Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson), he accepts the role and in doing so he overcomes his skepticism, learning about empathy, kindness, and decency from America's most beloved neighbor. The crux of Vogel's discontent is his memory of his absentee father Jerry Vogel (Chris Cooper), sharpened by the father's appearance at his sister's wedding. The end result - Vogel becomes the loving husband and father he wants to be and the 'relationship' between Rogers and Vogel works as well with adults as it did with children. And his father dies - reunited!There are strong points to the movie - the cast, the miniature aspects of the television show, the actual filming of a show whose star prefers simpler things like taking photos of his guests (or new neighbors) - but the story ultimately becomes a bit sappy and rehashes the old 'absent father angry son' motif to the extreme.

It's good to be positive in life but when I see him I just feel like waking him up. I just watched it because Tom Hanks was nominated for an Oscar for this role.

24,Mr-Fusion,Hanks and his nourishing chicken soup,8,20 April 2020,"In chaotic times, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is like a desperately needed warm hug; a film that wisely eschews the biopic in favor of a father/son drama. More than that, it's a drama couched in a Mister Rogers episode.That alone nurtures inventive direction, but Tom Hanks ably embodies the role of an icon. His performance is measured, genial and seemingly effortless while acting as a sort of Yoda to Matthew Rhys' injured soul (for lack of a better comparison).Not once did I feel manipulated during such a tearjerker, but even at its heaviest, it's still relatively benign.An enormously affective movie.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

For the simple fact that he loved everyone because they were different, because they should be or were meant to be. With this latest ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" this is not a profile or bio type doc of Fred Rogers, it instead shows how his influence and emotional kindness rubbed off on another.The film really is more about Tom Junod(Matthew Rhys) a journalist for a magazine who gets the story and profile of a lifetime when he does a cover interview about the one and only Fred Rogers(Tom Hanks). The film then blends connection and the forming of friendship so well between the two as it's nice to see the humanity and loving nature develop. The film is moving and touching as the scenes and sets try to create a real feel of the actual day and time of Mister Rogers. Overall good showcase of friendship and connection proving that love and kindness helps people.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

28,MOscarbradley,Hanks is terrific...but I still felt like killing him!,6,1 February 2020,"I like Tom Hanks; in fact, I like Tom Hanks a lot. I even think that, at his best, he can be a great actor but I wanted to kill Forrest Gump and now, all these years later, I want to kill Fred Rogers, the character, indeed the real-life character, Hanks plays in Marielle Heller's ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"". Mr Rogers, as he is known on American television, is one of those 'inspirational' TV hosts who teaches life lessons to children and shows them how to be 'nice' and apparently he's very good at it. In fact, he's something of a legend on American television. However, Heller's film isn't a biopic of Fred Rogers anymore than her ""Can You Ever Forgive Me"" was a biopic of Lee Israel. Rather it's the story of the friendship that developed between Rogers and the journalist Tom Junod, here renamed Lloyd Vogel and played by Matthew Rhys and the film is as twee as I imagined it was going to be.That said, Hanks is superb. He's Mr. Rogers down to the marrow but I still wanted to kill him, (not literally, I might add). Maybe I'm not that nice a person but I have an aversion to 'sweetness and light'. Now don't get me wrong; that's not to say I have an aversion to children and I think it's great when 'grown-ups' can put themselves into children's shoes and relate them on their level but as Jesus himself said, when I became a man I put away childish things and the last thing I want is to be talked down to by an adult like Fred Rogers. I am sure he is 'the nicest man on the planet' but I'm glad I don't know him.Of course, Heller's movie isn't all 'sweetness and light'. Rhys' journalist certainly isn't the nicest man on the planet. He's ordinary and angry and cynical and he gets into fights and maybe he's someone I wouldn't like to know either but I bet I could get drunk with him and have an adult conversation with him and Rhys is very good in the role as is Chris Cooper as the father he doesn't get along with. These characters add a very welcome touch of bitter to the sweet and give the film a much-needed edge. But in the end, this is Hanks' movie; love him or hate him, there is just no getting away from him. Even when he's not on screen you can feel his presence and that's Hanks' gift. I don't think he will win the Oscar for this but if he does, I won't complain.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,I like you.,7,2 February 2020,"In a lot of ways, 'A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood (2019)' is very conventional; its story could have been told twenty years ago. However, that doesn't mean it isn't effective or, indeed, relevant. The gentle wisdom of Mister Rogers resonates far beyond the children's program in which it mostly initially appeared, feeling increasingly more important in today's society of anonymous online squabbles and general political unrest. The movie seems to know this, focusing almost solely on the healing power of kindness and positing that forgiveness frees us all. There are moments where Rogers - who isn't the protagonist, by the way - seems to look through the lens and into our hearts, to be talking directly to each and every one of us. It's a bit saccharine, sure, but it undeniably works. The result is an entertaining, endearing and often emotional experience. It does exactly what it sets out to; nothing more, nothing less. It's not the most gripping or unique picture, but it doesn't really need to be. It's competent, confident and heart-warning. Sometimes, that's more than enough. 7/10",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
30,ThomasDrufke,Perfect Casting,8,26 November 2019,"The film's biggest strength is its ability to force the audience to be reflective on who in your own life got you to where you are now. There's a moment in both this film and in the 2018 documentary about Mr. Rogers that the filmmaker takes a pause for the audience to think about certain things and its as powerful as anything you'll see in theaters all year. Of course, you have to be willing to open up your mind to these thoughts in the first place, similar to Matthew Rhys' character in the movie and his unwillingness to forgive the people who have hurt him in the past. Even if 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood' doesn't have the consistent emotional punch that I thought, I get chills just thinking about Rogers, and specifically Tom Hanks playing Fred Rogers. If there was ever an actor more suited for a role, it's Hanks as Rogers. He's about as good as he can be, and this may be as good as a Fred Rogers narrative film can be. This should be a Thanksgiving week win for people of all ages.8.4/10",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
31,Cineanalyst,Neighborhood Reflections,8,8 March 2020,"I didn't grow up with Mister Rogers and so have no nostalgia for the subject of ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,"" and I tend to resist sentimental stories such as this one, but this is a clever and well-constructed piece of filmmaking, especially for a sidelong-glance biopic revolving around a magazine article about a host of a children's television show. Indeed, the writer begins with a puff-piece assignment, but winds up writing a feature mostly about himself. Most of the movie concerns the writer receiving informal therapy from Fred Rogers over his daddy issues instead of interviewing his subject. In a sense, the movie, then, is the one he writes within the very picture itself. It's a nice, if hardly original, construction reflecting the authorship of the narrative, which itself concerns a writer reflecting back upon himself. Director Marielle Heller's last picture, ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" (2018) was likewise about a writer. Yet, the narrative is also framed within the TV program of ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,"" and this is where it gets wonderfully creative--not unlike the real TV show, it would seem, which is full of song and music, videos within a Van Gogh painting, puppetry and the fourth-wall-breaking address of Rogers to the audience by directly looking into the camera.In addition to presenting the writer's story, Rogers becomes the surrogate filmmaker within the movie. Besides overseeing his own show-within-the-show and performing in it, portraying the puppets and playing the piano, he photographs people outside of the sound stage, including for the framing narrative that may or may not be real in the fictional, ""inspired by a true story"" diegesis. Rogers employs a picture board and a film-within-the-film (or, rather, a video within a painting that is within a TV show, real or dreamed, within a movie) of how magazines are made, as part of his telling of the writer writing his own story. The movie itself continues throughout to reflect the TV show by the alternating of cinematic widescreen and TV-square frame ratios and the use of city models as transitions.None of this does very well to give one a sense of the real Fred Rogers, though, but that's OK. Casting Tom Hanks in the part is brilliant in this respect, as a celebrity of that calibre always has one thinking of his performance as both Rogers the character and Hanks the star. The one special insight the interviewer manages to get out of his subject is that there's only one Mister Rogers. Rogers the character and Rogers the man are the same, mirror reflections. Sure, he had a private life, but as soon as the picture has him alone for us to see it--him pounding the tell-tale notes on the piano--it fades to black. Just like the interview and the resulting magazine article, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" isn't about him. It's not even really about the magazine writer, or, at least, I don't think that's a very interesting story, trite as it is. This is a movie that reflects back on itself in its construction.Moreover, it's one that reflects back upon the spectator viewing it--not unlike how the TV program reflected back on the world of the children watching it. The great scene here is the minute of silence Rogers has everyone in a restaurant take, to reflect on those who made themselves who they are. Rogers doesn't only lead these characters in this self-reflection, though; Hanks, outside of Mister Rogers and the TV cameras within the movie, looks right at the otherwise invisible camera recording the movie, through it to us. The power of the moment, then, largely depends on what we bring to it. In this neighborhood, we're encouraged to reflect on ourselves, and, in turn, we're reflected in the neighborhood.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

It's also the adapted screenplay inspired by the real life Tom Junod that is transformed by the fictional addition of a fight between son and father that somehow captures an important elemental piece of Fred Roger's existential existence without which the movie might not have had the emotive intensity to make it sufficiently inviting to audiences. Heller also introduces a series of surrealistic scenes from Mr. Roger's rebuilt sets that blend back and forth into the real world on screen as well as an extended scene which the primary character of Tom Junod's alter ego in the movie, Lloyd Vogel seems to enter into an intriguing Mr. Robert's neighborhood sequence.

37,Thanos_Alfie,Worth watching...,7,16 March 2020,"""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow the true story and the start of a real-life friendship between Fred Rogers and journalist Lloyd Vogel. Their friendship started around 1998 when the journalist Lloyd Vogel wrote an article on Mr. Rogers for Esquire magazine.I enjoyed this movie because it's based on real-life event and shows us a little bit of the personality of Mr. Rogers and how he affected people. I just wanted and expected to see even more about the life of Mr. Rogers and how he was in his daily life but in this movie the main subject was the life and the problems of the journalist Lloyd Vogel and how Mr. Rogers helped him to overcome those problems. I also liked the direction of this movie which was made by Marielle Heller and she presented us very well the affection that Mr. Rogers had on people and how he managed to understand and help everyone. The interpretations of both Tom Hanks who played as Fred Rogers and Matthew Rhys who played as Lloyd Vogel were simply exceptional. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that it will change your mind and the way you think or even react on many situations.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
38,cruise01,Outstanding performances but slow direction.,6,21 February 2020,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (3 out of 5 stars).A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a fair drama film focusing on a journalist who is tasked in interviewing tv's inspirational icon Fred Rogers. The film is meaningful and Fred Rogers is an inspiration to many people out there. Cause he was always positive and saw the world in a positive outlook. Sadly, this film kind of misses that opportunity in being inspirational and have a powerful emotionally driven film. Which it was trying to aim for that but missed out with its dull script.The plot follows Lloyd (Matthew Rhys) a journalist for Esquire. He lives with his wife Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson) and their newborn baby. He is distant with his family and his father Jerry (Chris Cooper). After a troubled past which left him and his father in a shaky relationship. He is tasked to interview Fred (Tom Hanks). As he attempts to learn from Fred's perspective while trying to get answers. Fred tries to turn the questions around and focuses on Lloyd and his family.The plot is good. Lloyd is a tough guy who despises his father. And stubborn with his personality. The character development changes with Lloyd and Fred. As they both learn from each other. Fred tries to get Lloyd to look at life differently. It is a nice message which todays audiences need. Especially with the rough world that has hate or rude people.The performances are great. Tom Hanks is great as Fred Rogers. From that soft spoken personality to his behavior. Matthew Rhys is good as Lloyd, a guy with a troubled past that he is trying to avoid. Susan Kelechi Watson is also good playing Lloyd's wife. Chris Cooper playing Lloyd's father who is a rough personality kind of guy.The film does suffer from a poor direction though. It can be slow. And dull at times. I feel like this movie has the story that could have been powerful but is lacking from the depth with the script. The films story is about dealing with grief and conflict within family. The film was lacking the emotional depth that it was trying to achieve.Overall, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a fair film. The script and direction is lacking the emotional connections with the characters. And making it dull and slow. The performances and story makes this film decent.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
39,zkonedog,A Beautiful Ode To A Television Legend,8,7 December 2019,"Fred Rogers has to be one of the most fascinating figures in the history of television. His children's program was revered for its simplicity, kindness, and thoughtfulness...and reviled or dismissed for much the same reasons. No matter what side of the fence you may have once found yourself, I believe that Rogers' overall message of hopefulness and positivity (with healthy doses of realism sprinkled in) plays well in the current political/social age. ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" does a great job of capturing all those currents on the big screen.For a very basic summary, ""Neighborhood"" follows the tract of Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), a journalist tasked with a very simple blurb assignment of American heroes and thus sent to meet Mr. Rogers (Tom Hanks). What Lloyd finds, however, is that the tables are often turned. Instead of him interviewing Rogers, Fred deconstructs (in his genteel way) Lloyd's anger/sadness, largely stemming from a poor relationship with his own father Jerry (Chris Cooper).One of the highlights of the entire experience is how the film is structured very much like a classic episode of ""Mr. Roger's Neighborhood"", right down to the iconic sweater-and-shoes opening and intercutting the cinema widescreen with 4:3 letterbox shots of the trolley clanging along amongst the miniatures. Even down to the content itself, which starts off perhaps a little uncertain but then progresses to a place of harmony, this is very much like those episodes you grew up watching, and that just feels good.While the main plot (""guy with daddy issues"") is almost overly simplistic, it actually provides a perfect opportunity to showcase the unique style of Rogers to work through conflict. Instead of high drama or voice-raising, Fred uses calming strategies to work through anger, whether in his own life or helping the lives of others. Again, a sort of soothing balm for the heated rhetoric often seen on the nightly news or cable news talk shows.Hanks, as usual, is a revelation. His next bad performance will be his first one. Down to the vocal inflections and bodily mannerisms, he truly channels the spirit of the iconic Rogers. Not an easy task considering how well-known and almost ubiquitous the man was. Davis and Cooper also provide the dramatically-charged interactions that are a needed counterpart to Hanks' understated nature.To be honest, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" night even be a slightly better than 8-star film. The personal reason I settle on that ranking? I had previously seen the document ""Won't You Be My Neighbor"", which covers roughly the same material (but just happened to ""hit me"" first). This one doesn't stray too much from the content in that doc (for good reason...that's the good stuff). For those getting these messages and visuals for the first time, it may be even more powerful.Overall, this is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by the entire family (it truly is PG through-and-through). The internal, plot-related content is moving, and the extrinsic messaging of Rogers' goals as an educator and entertainer are an important lesson to counter that of the popular media of today.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
40,eddie_baggins,A touching reminder of the joy of kindness,7,20 February 2020,"The wonderful 2018 documentary Won't You Be My Neighbour? covered the life of American TV icon and genuine real-life hero Fred Rogers in magnificent fashion, as we were thrown into Roger's world filled with a care and spirit for the human condition that seemed in some ways too good to be true.Reigniting interest in one of the most recognisable American's of all-time (at least for those within the USA), there was much joy when we all found out that the ""nicest man in Hollywood"" Tom Hanks would be donning the red sweater and blue sneakers and bringing Rogers too life in a feature film format.While those seeking a warts and all biopic of Rogers will be left disappointed by Marielle Heller's feature, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is another great reminder of the power of Roger's work, as Hanks alongside he capable co-lead Matthew Rhys tell us a story of redemption and forgiveness, as Rhys's hard-edged journalist Lloyd Vogel begins to face a life affirming revelation in the light of his companionship with Rogers.It's the type of wholesome and smile inducing story the world needs more of today, with Heller keeping things mostly on track throughout, even though a few instances, scenarios and sequences veer a little too far into the Hallmark Channel mould of movie-making, as she and her leading men ensure that Rogers insistence on helping Vogel come to terms with past grievances is a story we will all be able to relate to and one that will connect on some level emotionally to many that fall under its charms.The charms of Heller's film are not afraid to get slightly off-kilter to, as we enter unique moments with Vogel's dreamlike state taking him inside the Rogers TV program and Heller nicely recreating sets from the show to show off transition scenes in her tale, all proving that this is a loving tribute to a man and a program that changed the lives of many.Importantly for the film also, Hanks (in his first Oscar nominated role since Cast Away) is quite literally the perfect man to walk in Rogers shoes and does a great job of inhabiting the well-known persona, while Rhys, whose struggled for good roles outside of cult TV show The American's, finally gets a movie role that showcases his strong acting chops and while Vogel isn't the most instantly likeable of creatures, Rhys makes him just the right balance of frustrating and human, meaning that while this soul-searching narrative is by no means breaking new ground, it makes for always watchable and often very moving viewing.Final Say -Walking a well-trodden line of family drama storytelling, this based on a true story journey makes for extremely enjoyable viewing as the very essence of Roger's being is brought to life by a director and her cast who all work together to create a lovely reminder of the good in us all.3 ½ uncooperative tents out of 5",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
41,howard.schumann,It's what we do with our feelings that matter in this life,9,8 December 2019,"Loosely based on Tom Junod's 1998 Esquire article on children's television personality Fred Rogers, Marielle Heller's (""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"") bittersweet A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a potent antidote to the widespread cynicism that pervades our culture of scientifically-sanctioned meaninglessness. Known as Mr. Rogers, he was a TV icon for more than half a century who sang, played with puppets and personified the ideals of generosity, kindness, and compassion to millions of children throughout the world. The film, while not a traditional biopic, looks at Mr. Rogers (Tom Hanks, ""Sully"") through the eyes of investigative reporter Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys, ""The Post""), a pull-no-punches journalist, a man whose life unfortunately is consumed with bitterness.According to the director, ""There was something about working on this movie that made me see it as a gift. Fred felt the suffering of other people and the world really deeply, and it led him to do the work that he did."" Though the film is basically a true to life portrayal of Mr. Rogers, screenwriters Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster introduce a conflict between Vogel and his alcoholic dad (Chris Cooper, ""Live by Night"") to emphasize the point that failing to communicate and suppressing anger is self-defeating. Though Tom Hanks is basically relegated to a supporting role, he is still the movie's brightest light and the film loses some of its luster when he is not on the screen.A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood opens in a setting familiar to TV viewers of his show. Looking directly at the camera in his neatly constructed TV house, Mr. Rogers sings his theme song, puts on his trademark red sweater and sneakers and tells us in a soft, unhurried, almost soporific tone, about a friend of his, Lloyd Vogel, who is going through a difficult period in his life. We first encounter Vogel's dysfunctional relationship with his father at the wedding of Lloyd's sister (Tammy Blanchard, ""Rabbit Hole"") when, after some awkward attempts at conversation, they come to blows. It is only later that we find out that Vogel holds his father responsible for abandoning the family when his mother was dying.Assigned by his editor (Christine Lahti, ""Touched With Fire"") to write a flattering 400 word article on Mr. Rogers, what is known in the trade as a ""puff piece,"" Vogel, who has a reputation for taking people apart and forgetting to put them back together, is at first deeply skeptical of the reality of Rogers' reputation but agrees to the assignment. Angry and resentful, his barely suppressed feelings towards his father create tension in his marriage to his wife Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson, ""This Is Us"" TV series) and his infant son. When he tells Andrea that he is going to write about Mr. Rogers, knowing his reputation for cynicism, she warns him with tongue-in-cheek not to ""ruin her childhood.""When Vogel first meets Fred in a Pittsburgh studio, he expects a quick conversation and a respite from the tensions at home, but is taken aback when Rogers asks him about the wound on his face. Reluctant at first to talk about himself, through Rogers' persistence, he allows Lloyd to begin to express his feelings of abandonment, telling him that it is okay to be angry and that he knows it is very hard to forgive someone we love. One of the most moving scenes in the film takes place in a restaurant where, during a conversation, Fred asks Vogel to pause for a minute and remember the people in his life who loved him.The minute of complete silence captures the essence of the man and reminded me of the power of Emma Gonzales who, at the 2018 March for Our Lives demonstration, after naming the seventeen victims of the Parkland high school shooting, stood silently for over four minutes, before ending her speech saying, ""Fight for your lives before it's someone else's job."" Despite all efforts to avoid it, however, the ubiquitous Mister Rogers comes across as somewhat larger than life, a man whose only negative character trait seems to be banging on the lower register of the piano to express his feelings, but it is Hanks projection of sincerity and caring that wins us over.While the emotional release the director may have intended is somewhat thwarted by the unlikeability of Vogel's character, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is still a timely and resonant film that is touching and heartfelt without being manipulative (except for a contrived scene on a subway train where passengers burst out singing Rogers' theme song). To put an exclamation point on the film's relevance, Heller says, ""The world is in need of kindness right now. I think we all feel that . . . at this moment in my life, at this moment politically, I wanted to make a movie about a person who truly embodies deep thinking, compassion and inclusivity. And Fred Rogers was that person. He dedicated his life to small genuine acts of compassion, and this movie shows how those small acts can change the lives of people around us."" It does indeed.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I think his mannerisms were great and his voice mimicked the real Mr. Rogers just good enough to let you suspend reality for 90 minutes. He should get best supporting actor.The movie was boring at first. I fell asleep during the first 15 minutes. Then something happened which really is rare for me in movies. I became captivated by the story and the acting. It really became interesting to see that this movie was not about Mr Rogers, but Tom Junod who worked for Esquire magazine.The story moves along slowly and at a steady pace. You learn a lot about Mr Rogers and his life, his personal life. Many things which I did not know about him which were very spiritual. It wasn't all about ""god"" but about being good to others.Mr Rogers really worked well with children and he made them the focus of his life.Tom Junod walks a long road to reach a conclusion about himself and all the problems in his life.

Tom Hanks was the best choice to play Mr. Rogers, he really brought every essence of the man to his performance. And I heard it was Fred Rogers widow idea to get Tom Hanks to play him.

This movie is based on a true story about a reporter named Tom Junod who wrote an article for a magazine about tv children's host Fred Rogers. The movie is mostly about the two men's relationship and how they became good friends. Tom plays Fred Rogers and Matthew is the reporter. Matthew is a person that is pretty much the opposite of Tom; he is angry at people in his life and struggling with how to forgive them, plus he doesn't believe anyone can be as kind and gentle as Tom appears to be on tv-he thinks it is just an act. Chris is Matthew's father who has issues with Matthew and Christine is Matthew's boss that gives Matthew the assignment of writing a profile on Tom. It is an emotional story and Tom-as well as everyone else-does a great job in his portrayal. I liked how they would use what looked like the sets of the old tv show-the toy houses & cars & people, etc-between scene changes and they even recreated scenes from the tv show. During the end credits, you see and hear the real Fred Rogers singing a song. Overall, it was a beautiful day at the movies.
It's rated ""PG"" for a brief fight and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.
I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-I know lots of people would but one viewing was enough for me-but it would be a great rental, especially if you are a fan.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

It's a thoughtful,textured contemplation of how we can effectively deal with our expectations, disappointments and imperfections.

52,CubsandCulture,Can You Say...Wonderful?,10,23 December 2019,"I think people should know that going into this film that it is not really a biopic of Fred Rogers. He isn't even the main character. If you are looking for a film that is much more about the man's life ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"" is the better fit. This film is more about how Fred Roger's worldview really helped out a reporter work through some interpersonal baggage. On that level it is a wonderful exquisitely humane story of one human helping another. Rogers' radical decency is demonstrated in this film; in all its facets as well. Lloyd's struggles with how Rogers *is* just feel correct. Rhys gives a striking performance of Llyod that has a quiet power to it. This is the sort of very mature drama that is missing from the cinemas. It is a wholesome film and I think Rogers would be very appreciative of itHeller and her screenwriter make a very bold choice of framing the story as an episode of Mr. Rogers show. It gives the film a playful energy that counterbalances the gravity of Lloyd's personal story while being playful in the way Rogers was. The film doesn't simplify the material to make it easier to process and there is a pretty big ambiguity at the end of film that provides the story with emotional power. The film makes sure to not present Rogers as an infallible human being. There is a quiet Christian feeling to the whole thing; The film could have been called putting the gospel into practice.Hanks is rather good as Mr. Rogers despite the physical and vocal differences. Best he isn't doing a straight impression of Rogers. (The King Friday voice is especially different) Instead Hanks finds a comfortable middle ground of doing a light impression while shaping his choices for dramatic effect.

A reporter for a magazine is given an assignment to write a few words on an upcoming issue dedicated to heroes. His is Fred Rogers, the immortal man who inspired millions of lives w/his quiet & humble television show broadcast from Pittsburgh. Our scribe, played Matthew Rhys (late of The Americans), has a tense relationship w/his father, played by Oscar winner Chris Cooper, which leads to fisticuffs when they go at it at his sister's wedding. Arriving at the taping of one of Mr. Rogers shows, Fred notices the shiner he's wearing & through pointed yet gentle questions (& through several Q & A sessions) coaxes the hurt & resentment from the writer while at the same time we learn what makes Mr. Rogers tick & surprisingly how human he is (an offhanded confession of how one of his sons 'tested' him when he was being raised was a particular eye opener). Tom Hanks, a shoo-in for an Oscar nom this year, may not look like our beloved teacher but he uncannily captures the quiet decency Fred Rogers exuded whether he was in front of the camera or taking a nonchalant train ride home. Director Marie Heller scores another triumph (she helmed last year's Can You Ever Forgive Me?) by using the conceit of this film shot like an episode of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, complete w/city vistas populated w/miniatures underscored by a minimalist score often heard on the TV show.

The acting is quite great, with Tom Hanks obviously providing for a fantastic Mr. Rogers, and Matthew Rhys does an outstanding and poignant performance as Lloyd Vogel (aka the journalist) in the film. The script and transitions can be both utterly amusing and somewhat hard to follow, but the emotion delved into along the way is more than worth the trouble. The film is quite in fact beautiful on its own tale of human conflict and emotion and tells it with such incredible feat it's hard not to be moved by it. The film also looks great, with some brilliant cinematography, and a wonderful 90's look that seems more than fitting for the time and place it appears in.

62,questl-18592,Tom Rogers,8,4 December 2019,"It feels rare these days to find a movie willing to take its time and live in moments, to really steep in the spaces between words and simply let what's on screen be impactful all on its own. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood manages this well. Yes, it can be slow at times, but slow in a way that's methodical and with purpose. It isn't rushing to blurt something out, to fill silences with inane babble but then this is a movie with a very clear purpose in mind.Fred Rogers, by all accounts, was a remarkable man. His impact on the lives of countless children can't be overstated and yet, ABDITN doesn't focus on Mr Rogers directly but rather on a journalist interviewing him and the impact that he has. Of course, a film like this doesn't work without great performances and those abound. All of our characters are well portrayed as they progress through their varied journeys. Hanks, to no one's surprise, manages to steal this movie despite not being the main character. That said, Matthew Rhys delivers a marvelous performance as well that really lets us feel what he's going through.This is not a perfect movie though, there were some distracting things that, while not necessarily flaws because they seemed intended, took me out of the movie. The transitions, for instance, all utilize the model sets from Mr Rogers Neighborhood, which is a fun touch but took a little while to get used to and acts as a constant reminder that you're in a chair watching a movie. There's also a prolonged moment where Mr Rogers looks directly at the camera in, again, a very intentional way that just felt... Weird and heavy-handed.People are fascinating though. Growing up, I watched Mr Rogers Neighborhood. As I got older, I remember the stories that came out. Tales of Fred Rogers the special forces soldier, the man that had to wear those sweaters to cover his full sleeve tattoos. Myths that arose because it was just too hard to believe someone could legitimately be that good. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood believes Fred Rogers was that good and what's more it believes that, with a little effort, anyone can be that good. So many people have said we could use a Mr Rogers these days and I think they're missing the point of the movie. Don't wish for someone to be that, be that yourself. It challenges us not to be perfect, but to be better and that is always a valuable message.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

67,jadepietro,A Beautiful Performance,7,28 November 2019,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A nice movie about a nice man in which Tom Hanks plays his muse, Fred Rogers, with such skill and flair.JIM'S REVIEW: While leaving the movie theater that was showing Marielle Heller's A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, I overheard one moviegoer saying, ""Now that was a nice movie!"" I couldn't agree more with her assessment. Why, Mr. Rogers himself would be proud and give the movie his full endorsement! But this feel-good movie does have some serious problems that this reviewer had trouble overlooking, despite its positive messaging and fine acting.So, if the man himself can be honest and totally upfront with his viewers, then so can I. Do you want to hear my thoughts, dear moviegoers?Well, first I have some sad news to share. Even though Ms. Heller solidly directs her film, she has difficulty aligned her two storylines. The film follows the too saintly Mr. Rogers and his celebrity effect on both adults and children, but it unwisely makes him a supporting character in this retelling of an Esquire article about this icon. Instead, it focuses on the life of its writer, Lloyd Vogel, and his inability to forgive his father's abandonment issues. While both subplots are well written by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, the former story is just more interesting than the latter, and less predictable in its outcome. Still, most scenes resonate due to the nostalgia factor, although other moments in the movie are borderline mawkish and overly sentimental.The director earnestly tries to use different screen format sizes and miniature sets of Mr. Roger's television neighborhood as a visual transition to the real world of these two characters. Yet the end result is less than seamless, more contrived and overdone. The film also effectively captures the poor production values of Fred Rogers' popular children's program...sometimes too realistically with its truly awful blenched-out and unfocused photography by Jody Lee Lipes. This movie has to be one of the worst lensed film of the year.After having said all that, boys and girls, we do have good news to hear too. Can you say...Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks. He is perfection! This actor impersonates this engaging host by relying on his sly friendly smile, vocal intonations, physical stance, and modulated line delivery. It's a wise reactionary performance that adds so much to the character's well known persona. He plays the television personality as part psychologist, past pastor. (In reality, Fred Rogers was an ordained minister turned television host.) The famous red cardigan suits Mr. Hanks well. It is one of his finest roles to date.Mr. Hanks is equally supported by a fine cast led by Matthew Rhys as Fred's new found friend and latest crusade for redemption. Mr. Rhys' part has more of a dramatic arc to challenge the actor and he is fully up to the task. Also providing strong contributions to the film are Susan Kelechi Watson as Lloyd's caring wife and Chris Cooper as his irresponsible father.So, my friends, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood will always entertains you, even if it does not always succeed in its narrative. Yes, this is a definitely a nice movie to see, especially if you want to appreciate the great Mr. Hanks and his legendary muse, Mr. Fred Rogers. Theirs is a beautiful relationship.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

However, amidst the islands of these extreme characters, there are real champions who strive to make others happy and the darkness of the world a little more manageable. Mr. Rogers was considered by many to be one of those saints, making a program that was entertaining and yet moving in his approach to the real world.

Some Character Utilization
Drama vs. Realism QuestionThe VERDICT:While the documentary dove into the history of Rogers, this installment helps bring the magic of one man's impact on the world. A Beautiful Day In the Neighborhood is an artful film that captures the magic of Rogers' approach to life and presents it in a style that seems to be a doctored-up version of the show. The transitions using Roger's model like world were cute, alongside how they presented the meat of the subject as a surrealistic episode that somehow acts as a counseling session to the audience members. This film balances the story of the other characters and incorporates Rogers involvement in the world, leading to a fantastic portrayal of character development without discarding all the other components of the film. Writing wise, it will hit the hearts of many, rich with wisdom and thought-provoking material without being too preachy or forced as many movies can be. The comedy is subtle, a natural inclusion that is not artificial, leading to a genuine laugh that adds a layer to the movie. Finally, the acting is the cornerstone of the film, Hanks execution of Rogers spot on in many ways, while Rhys as the journalist is a wonderful antagonist to Hanks, whose performance is a display of the kind of commitment friendship sometimes takes. While the rest of the cast is there to support the group in many ways, it's these two alongside the presentation that delivers the hammer.
There are few dislikes I have for this film personally, with many of these a little nitpicky on my part. For one thing, the pace and content are not going to be for everyone, but the pace in particular had me fighting sleep at times. In addition, I had hoped other characters would have been worked into the mix, while others sort of forgone, to really tie in all of Roger's aspects in his attempt to help Lloyd. Finally, there are moments where reality vs. dramatization come into play, questioning the choices of the shot or sequence that while symbolic were not fully necessary for me.Overall though, the movie is a beautiful portrayal of the messages the beloved kid's host had, and the impact he had on so many. It's not going to be for everyone, and it certainly is not the most engaging in terms of entertainment or originality. Yet, for those that love dramatic biographies, or need a spiritual message into the movie, this humble look at the sad parts of life and how to maintain humanity should be a welcoming start to the spirit of the holiday season. So wrapping all of this together, my scores for this film are:Biography/Drama: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
69,rannynm,Timely Message About Forgiveness and Redemption,9,18 November 2019,"It's definitely A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood when Tom Hanks portrays the iconic Mister Rogers. The message is timely and needed now more than ever. This movie is not what I expected. You learn about Mr. Rogers' through his relationship with a man who didn't want to be his friend or neighbor. It's a message that we all need to hear.A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is based on a true life story about the relationship that develops between Fred Rogers and a cynical reporter who is loath to interview him for a piece on American heroes. In the movie, the reporter is Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) who gives an amazing performance. Through his interactions with Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks), Vogel begins to understand that part of him is broken. The healing process begins as their friendship develops and you see Fred Rogers teaching him to understand, accept and voice his emotions and feelings. It is beautiful. Tom Hanks is masterful in this role at bringing out the transformation of his friend.In addition to Tom Hanks and Matthew Rhys, the cast has other powerful performances, notably Chris Cooper who plays Lloyd's dad, Jerry Vogel. Christine Lahti, as Lloyd's Editor Ellen, pushes him to work on the hero piece and adds a touching element to the movie as well. The film is directed by Marielle Heller and written by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster. Music plays an important role in this movie and is by Nate Heller. The scenes of Mr. Rogers playing the piano along with the behind-the-scenes of the television show during filming of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood are particularly moving.The message of this film is that anyone can change the world with words. It's a powerful message that we often forget. Listen and think before you speak, as your words impact others. Fred Rogers finds a positive way to help others express their feelings, which is not an easy thing to do, although he makes it look easy. Forgiveness and redemption are another theme in this film.I rate this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 4 to 18 and adults will love it as well.Reviewed by Selene W., KIDS FIRST!

71,Tornado_Sam,This movie IS about Mr. Rogers,10,1 December 2019,"I caught a late night showing of this beautiful film about Mr. Rogers last night, and the first thing I have to say is that I was blown away. Reading that it was PG-rated and contained some language as well as a bit of violence, I thought ""Uh-oh, here goes Hollywood again, throwing in unnecessary crap to a movie about one of the kindest people who ever lived. Gosh, can't they skip that for once?"" It turned out I was entirely wrong in this thinking. I knew from the trailers that it would be pretty good, I had read about the fact it was more about the journalist Lloyd Vogel, and I was ready for an eight-star film. Instead, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" exceeded my expectations so over the mark and gave me so much more than I initially thought, that it is truly an outstanding work.Let me explain my review title. Lots of people who have already seen this and reviewed have said several times ""I was expecting this to be a biopic about Mr. Rogers, but instead it got more into the journalist's story than his. Hanks doesn't get enough screen time..."" What these people don't see is that if this was about Rogers's life, it wouldn't be impacting in any way, just an exploration into the man as a person. What the real goal of this film was from the beginning was to show Rogers's impact on other people, how he cares and loves for others, how he deals with feelings, and above all, how he teaches them about forgiveness. In the literal sense, the film really is more about Vogel than the beloved children's host. In the figurative sense, it really does center around Mr. Rogers in a way that is hard to explain. To get how, you would have to see it yourself; but those who criticize this as not being a biopic don't get that being a biopic was not the film's goal.Because the negatives are very few and far between, I'll address those first. Number one, the biggest problem: the guy who played Mr. McFeeley did a bad job. Sorry Daniel Krell, but you just did not do it. Physically, Krell was fine as an onscreen appearance, but when it came to carrying off the energetic charm of his character, he flopped miserably. Mr. McFeeley was always a happy, joyful character when appearing on the show; this guy looked like he was having a mini-seizure whilst being on drugs. It didn't help that the interaction between him and Hanks was awkward because the script wasn't at its finest there: literally, McFeeley comes through the door, and says ""Hey, uh, I, uh, have a magazine. I don't know how to start this conversation better, so I'll just jump right into it."" Thankfully, this scene lasts no longer than a minute, and McFeeley is out of the picture after that.One other thing: Hanks, when voicing Daniel Tiger and singing for him, struggles with those high notes. He probably couldn't do any better, so that's just a small gripe that hardly subtracts anything from the film as a whole. Also, get rid of the language. I know it's a broken family, but this is about Mr. Rogers! You do not need to be that realistic. At least it didn't get any worse and remained fairly infrequent throughout the film.Now come the positives, which are numerous. So many good things to say. Number one, the filmmakers could have chosen no better way to relate the story than to have Mr. Rogers on his normal program in his television house, showing us a picture of Lloyd and talking about him to start the story off. And then continuing the story when Mr. McFeeley arrives with a tape about how people make magazines (titled ""How People Make Magazines"", lol), which leads into how Vogel gets his assignment to interview the icon. The way it ends, with Rogers playing one of his own pieces on the piano, then cutting to the end credits and even including a bit of archive footage of the real Mr. Rogers himself, is beautiful.The acting is spot-on. From the beginning, I knew that people wouldn't like this because Tom Hanks wouldn't look EXACTLY like his role. These people are perfectionists. It's hard to make a film about a dead, famous icon that everybody knows and loves so well, but this did the best possible job in every sense. Hanks may not sound like Rogers or look like him, but he carried off the part perfectly; they could have chosen no better actor. Of course, some of this goes to the script fitting the television host's character excellently. The way Hanks talks to the viewer about forgiving people and about how Vogel got abused on the inside is so reminiscent of the TV show's scripts that it's eerie. Matthew Rhys didn't have such a demanding role to play, but he excels every bit as well in playing such a confused, messed-up person. The rest of the cast, likewise, is very good.Another thing that struck me: the dream sequences. I will not give those away, but they were both humorous and dramatic. I could feel Vogel's emotions as Mr. Rogers brings the confused journalist onto set to talk about hospitals, and this is where the dramatic elements of the movie come into play very well. In a Hollywood-type way yes, but done right to where we can sympathize with the protagonist. Sure it's overblown, but in a good way.Finally, the religious aspect. I didn't think they'd have the guts to do this, but they actually provided some insight into Rogers religious life by showing him first praying for all of his friends at his bedside at night, then swimming in the morning at the pool. Being a Christian, this may be important only to me, but it certainly surprised me that they did that. I'm glad they could throw in a few religious sentiments without annoying non-Christians; it was a really important scene without some realizing it.I could go on, but need I say more? The bottom line is, this movie has such a great message, provides such an accurate portrayal of the central character(s), and tells its story in such a distinct way that it exceeds all expectations, as it certainly did mine. If you know Mr. Rogers and have seen the show, it's especially beautiful. I completely recommend it to anyone; a masterpiece.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

73,krocheav,A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood - A Beautiful Day Anywhere,9,5 October 2020,"I'm sceptical when approaching movies along these lines and if you are also, do yourself (and everyone around you) a favour - just watch it regardless. There are many scenes in this pic that go to places very few movies, especially today's, would dare to. That doesn't exactly mean the moviemakers have been honest enough to tell the whole story of Fred Rogers and his remarkable personality but, where they do go --leads us to find out more for ourselves-- so that's a good thing. The unusual sets are used with great success as stepping stones to other parts of the story - creating a better than might be expected connection to the real-life situations.What was to be expected is that democratically weighted PC Hollywood - shows little interest in exploring where Mr Roger's sensitively-tuned philosophy was born. Here, he's mostly presented as a humanitarian who wants to make the world, and our relationships within it better for us all...but there's more to this complex TV personality than they care to explore. Apart from this, 'A Beautiful Day' is modern movie making at its finest and most meaningful with well-realised performances throughout.There's another story about the time this real-life man, who, while being presented with an Emmy, dared to tell Television to 'shut-up' (in a nice way) and take ten seconds of silence, to stop screeching on about its own blindness to its own worthlessness - and spare a thought for all the real people, who during their developing years helped it/them become something better. Of course, Mr Rogers was talking about thoughts and feelings many would now, no longer recognise or understand - especially when you look at the endlessness of its mostly soulless, fake-reality. This is certainly a man finely tuned to understanding our own reality.Should engage most audiences as it puts up a mirror to our own relationships and how we deal with them. One of the year's best for people who want more than simplistic action flicks, and for those who still know how to extract the very best that movies about intelligent people might have to offer.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
74,martimusross,A Very Strange And Remarkable Movie,7,6 February 2020,"A Beautiful In The Neighbourhood.From the outset I must say I enjoyed this movie but totally accept its not for everyone.A movie about child psychology applied to the emotional and developmental needs of very young children and then applied, not in the land of make-believe, but to a real broken family is unbelievably clever but is it the stuff of a gripping movie.What was good.The acting was tight and competent from the entire ensemble if a little repetitive and predictable.The musical score was great and really set the scene.The clever way they interwove the historical reality of Mister Rogers children's show and a rather tawdry kitchen sink melodrama.The graphics were brilliantly used to keep us linked to the format of the show and continually remind us of the childlike state within which we are meant to live.What was problematicWe, the audience, were not initially aware who was Mister Rogers, and in this ignorance Tom Hanks low, slow and paternalistic character seemed creepy and coercive.The formulaic format of Mister Rogers show created a reassuring predictable setting that was a safe space to introduce issues and problems with solutions and understanding from a Christian perspective, after-all Mr Rogers Presbyterian ministry was in TV. This element was only explored by example and we the viewer needed greater understanding as this aspect was pivotal.I would also suggest that his detailed preparation of the scripts of the show with his child psychologist collaborator of 30 years may have removed the haphazard interpretation we the viewer made of the show, when in fact it was a scientific experiment of the then current medical thought on child development.I felt frustrated by the obvious psychological manipulation of Lloyd Vogel, there was no subtlety here, he was an adult that Mister Rogers tried to treat with child psychology (duh!), and because this was badly handled this devalued the movie, a great shame.This is Hollywood at its best, a niche unknown story brought to the world",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

81,proud_luddite,Hanks at his best - and that's obviously saying a lot!,8,18 May 2020,"Based on a true story: in 1998, Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) is a tough, cynical journalist working for Esquire magazine. He is assigned to write an article on Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks) of ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" fame. With various meetings between the two in New York and Pittsburgh, Fred's gentle approach to life breaks through Lloyd's emotional distance that is due to a troubled childhood.The story of Lloyd and his family is somewhat predictable but it is still genuinely moving. But the movie truly shines every time Hanks is on the screen as he ably channels a revered spirit of the past, one whose attitudes might seem out-of-place at first but are the perfect antidote for Lloyd's jaded sadness. This movie takes the viewer back to a time when the likes of Mr. Rogers still had influence and good influence at that. And in the seemingly simplest ways, Hanks can generate tears with the smallest of gestures. His portrayal of Rogers is like that of a human of a higher spirit (which many believed Fred Rogers to be).One of the most enjoyable moments of the film occurs when a small group of young strangers recognize Mr. Rogers on a subway train. Their spontaneous action is delightful especially when tough-looking, middle-aged men join in on the fun. The late 1990s is not long ago but it was just shortly before the current era of massive selfie/smartphone addiction. As such a joyful crowd moment is unlikely to happen in our current times (though the eventual post-COVID era might change things), this scene - and the nostalgia it revives - adds to the many other enjoyments of ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"". - dbamateurcriticRATING 8 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Acting by Tom Hanks",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

The opening sequence is just really strange - not in an unpleasant way but did make me wonder what kind of film this was going to be.This film is about Mr Rogers but not told from his view point.
Instead it is told from the view point of a man who is self destructing and forced to interview Mr Rogers.What follows is slow, thoughtful and heart warming.
Mr Rogers is portrayed as this odd ball who seeks to see the good in everyone and employs a formidable patience.It is nice to think that such a person could exist in the world but -as a cynical Brit - I wouldn't want to get trapped in a lift with him.This is a bit arty has moments of emotional grit and does probe at mental illness - not particularly the family movie that i was expecting.A good watch - but you will need to be patient with it.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

85,rockman182,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood(2019),8,12 December 2019,"I loved the heartfelt documentary that we saw recently about the live and genuine personality of Fred Rogers. It covered so much about a television icon and was an enlightening look at what made him such a cherished figure. When I heard Marielle Heller (who did a great job with Can You Ever Forgive Me? and Diary of a Teenage Girl), I became super excited. Also, Tom Hanks, America's favorite Hollywood Icon starring as Mr. Rogers? Sign me up. This turned out to be a rather wonderful viewing.
The film follows the life of Lloyd Vogel, who is a journalist for Esquire. He has a very strained relationship with his father and this seeps into his life. He is tasked by his employer to get an interview with Mr Rogers, star of a child friendly TV show. Upon meeting him, he realizes that Mr Rogers is a much more complex person than he initially thought, and Lloyd receives introspection into his own troubled life, all with the help of Fred Rogers.
I loved the presentation of this film. A chunk of it recreates authentic looking sets from Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and even presents itself in his TV show format. Heller takes liberties with creativity and it works. Tom Hanks is so excellent as Fred Rogers, he disappears into the role and really transports you into the life of the beloved icon. Matthew Rhys also turns in an emotionally pained performance, its just great all around. There are lagging moments as the film carries on but its not much of a bother because of all the intriguing things going on.
This isn't that much a Mr Roger's biopic. Which is actually great, because the documentary did a good job of detailing his life already. This is more the character story of a journalist as he changes his outlook on life with the inspiration of Fred Rogers. Its about the impact that Mr. Rogers has on people of all ages. His words of wisdom, creativity, and kind soul endure through decades and generations and I really appreciate that we were able to see this film.

86,jon.h.ochiai,"Power of Forgiveness in ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood""",9,25 November 2019,"At the Chinese restaurant in Fred Rogers' beloved Pittsburgh, suffering Lloyd Vogel, played by Matthew Rhys, gets why Mister Rogers likes people like him: He's ""broken"". Tom Hanks's Fred looks in Lloyd's eyes, ""You're not broken."" He invites Lloyd to think about the ones, who ""loved you into existence"".That's the touching humanity of Director Marielle Heller's ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"". Yes, the movie isn't perfect. Yet, much like Mister Rogers, it sources from a good space: The power of forgiveness, the power of kindness.Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster's screenplay is based the friendship of Fred Roger (""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"") and Writer Tom Junod. Tom wrote his Esquire article in 1998 that inspired the narrative. At times, ""A Beautiful Day"" occurs as nearly allegory, almost fable.Micah and Noah's narrative surprise: Fred Rogers isn't the conceit. Rather, it's Lloyd's journey. That seems the catharsis of real-life writer Tom Junod. When distraught Lloyd appears in ""Neighborhood of Make-Believe"" that's indulgent disbelief. That can be forgiven, as well.Throughout, Tom Hank's poignantly authentic performance as Fred Rogers inspires. Occasionally, Matthew Rhys's relentless anger get wearisome. Yet, Tom's quiet empathy reminds that Lloyd suffers in his unwillingness to just let go.The movie opens with Mister Rogers in his beloved red sweater asking children at home, ""Do you know what forgive means?"" That lands. Back when I was one of those kids watching ""Mister Rogers'"", I felt that he was talking to me. He listened. He actually got me.""A Beautiful Day"" works in Tom's powerful listening, and his authentic vulnerability. Solid Maryann Plunkett as Fred's wife Joanne tells Lloyd that Fred ""is not perfect"". He doesn't want to be a saint, because that would make him ""unattainable"". Cynical Lloyd gets that Fred is someone to aspire to be.Award winning writer Lloyd is a new father. His understanding wife Andrea, played by smart strong Susan Kelechi Watson, forsakes her career to be the stay-at-home Mom.Lloyd and Andrea attend his sister Lorraine's wedding. Lorraine is played by comically aloof Tammy Blanchard. Lorraine invites their estranged jerk-like Father Jerry, played by believable self-righteous Chris Cooper. The two brawl at the wedding, apparently over Lloyd's late Mother.Meanwhile, Lloyd, who has the reputation for demonizing interviews, is given an assignment by his Editor Ellen, played by beautiful edgy Christine Lahti. Esquire Magazine is doing a series on American Heroes. Lloyd's assignment: Fred Rogers. Even Andrea warns, ""... Please don't ruin my childhood.""Lloyd looks to reveal Fred's darker side. After all, no one can be that good? When they do meet: who is interviewing who? Fred admits he wasn't the best Father to his two sons. He quickly discerns Lloyd's profound suffering. Lloyd tells of the fight with his Father. Fred sighs, ""Oh, my..."" Tom's visceral well of compassion defines ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" as something special.""A Beautiful Day"" is about letting go of the anger that hides our fear. Forgive others as we forgive ourselves. Much like watching ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" back when I was 6 years old, there's a lesson. Tom's Fred thoughtfully speaks about the nature of death. He says, ""Anything mentionable is manageable."" Amen.""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" might not be perfect, which it never intends to be. Yet, it speaks to the power of forgiveness, the power of kindness. Forgiveness and kindness are the enduring legacy of Fred Rogers. Just saying.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
87,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A movie not really about Mr. Rogers.,6,20 March 2020,"There's one quote in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019) that sums up the entire movie. ""This isn't really about Fred Rogers."" Considering this film was based on the magazine article that is central to the plot, it's no wonder that Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks) is merely an ancillary character to the events that happen in Lloyd Vogel's (Matthew Rhys) life. While Mr. Rogers' gentle influence is undeniable, I can't help but think that the recent documentary, Won't You Be My Neighbor? (2018), is a better examination of his life's work overall.I do have to give kudos to Tom Hanks for taking on a challenging role that has many fond memories for tons of people. Hanks captured Fred Rogers' soft-spoken demeanor and gentle mannerisms as best as only he could. Part of the trouble, though, is that Tom Hanks is so recognizable, that half the time I thought I was watching Fred Rogers, while the other half I couldn't shake the fact that I was watching Tom Hanks acting. I'm not sure how to get around this, since Hanks' star power is part of what sold this movie, and finding someone who looks more like Mr. Rogers and teaching them to act the role would have been much more difficult.In the end, the main plot of a man overcoming family drama isn't that spectacular of a story. It's almost so commonplace as to be ""ho-hum."" The meaningful crux of this film is definitely how Fred Rogers' Christian values were able to show how the right thing to do isn't always the easiest. The human condition often wants us to remain angry at those who have wronged us. This is why forgiveness is such a difficult concept to put into practice. Then again, Mr. Rogers was an expert at handling difficult concepts at a level that even children could understand them.A movie not really about Mr. Rogers, I give A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood 3.0 stars out of 5.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
88,RforFilm,"It's You I like. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is like an episode of Mister Rogers; it's patient, gentle and makes you want to be a better person",9,6 December 2019,"Though I'm not a parent myself, I do fear about how I'm going to bring up children. We have to accept that no one is perfect and we simply have to do the best we can. Still, that does make me thing about how I was raised as I think about the triumphs and mistakes my own parents have done. They are role models and I try to consider the other role models I've grown up with. One such man is Fred Rogers, the lovable host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. He's the prime example of a saint, someone who's dedicated his life to helping children and how he approached it differently.It was only recently we had gotten a wonderful documentary on Rogers in Won't You be my Neighbor. While that movie was a biography that dwelled into his personality and philosophy, today's movie tells a story about a man who comes to understand that Fred Rogers is a guy who's just as nice as he was on TV. It's understandable that one might be questionable about him, especially in an age where a lot of misinformation is spread and people are simply not as trusting. This story shine through in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.In the late 90's, a reporter Lloyd Vogel (played by Matthew Rhys) has won awards, but has also gained a reputation for trying to expose his subjects, and is finding it harder to get assignments at Esquire. At the same time, he and his wife Andrea (played by Susan Kelechi Watson) have just had their first child born. The prospect of having become a father has frightened him as his relationship with his own father Jerry (played by Chris Cooper) is very dysfunctional. When Jerry ends up saying some things to Lloyd, the two end up in a fight at a family's wedding.Lloyd is assigned to interview Fred Rogers for an article on American heroes. Though reluctant to take on a children's television host, he gets a phone call from him personally and travels to Pittsburgh. It's there where he goes to the set of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood where he meets Rogers (played by Tom Hanks) who shockingly comes off as nice as he is on TV. Lloyd is determined to dive into Rogers' personality but starts to understand that perhaps the man's kindness starts to make himself reflect on his relationship with everyone.It's already hard to hate or even dislike a guy like Mister Rogers. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood not only shows that Fred Rogers was just as human as anyone else, but just how he emphasized the importance of being patient and trusting. In order for this film to work, they needed a great actor for Rogers and Tom Hanks proves himself again a great actor. I was afraid that I was only going to see Tom Hanks, but I'll admit there were plenty of points where I got lost in his portrayal.Rogers also happens to only be a supporting character. The story is really about Matthew Rhys as a cynical writer who changes for the better. He not only represents the soul whose closed off nature has made him a bad writer, but of modern society who has become more paranoid about people in general. His journey is not an easy one, and can be tough when confronted about his child and his father. The movie even has a trippy sequence where his insecurities are on display in front of Rogers'. But within the bigger picture, it's still a story about how far kindness can get you without becoming a victim to naivety.A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is not just an impressive story, but it's even shot in an impressive way. There are a couple of moments where I felt like I was back to my childhood. Some of it is when it tries to recreate the show through its obvious video photography and even screen ratio size, and some it comes through the structure of the script which evolves in a gentile manner. It's like the movie really wanted to be a slightly darker and longer episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.I'll give this nine red trolley models out of ten. This is a movie I recommend for the family, even above Frozen 2 (which I'm sure most have seen already). I even recommend it for adults on their own. If anything, this may have been Tom Hanks most challenging role in a while. Its worth it alone to see him play such a kind figure. It certainly is a beautiful day in the neighborhood, so please got out and see this.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

90,bankofmarquis,"Warm, gentle, slow-paced with lots of HEART",8,6 December 2019,"The new ""Mr. Rogers"" movie, A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD is gentle, warm, slow, kind and heartfelt - just the type of film that is antithetical to how life is bounding past all of us on a daily basis. It would be well worth your time to slow down, turn off the electronics, and take in this wonderfully loving film.Tom Hanks, of course, stars as Mr. Rogers - the beloved TV Host of the beloved children's show MR. ROGERS NEIGHBORHOOD and he does a remarkable job of bringing this kind gentle soul to life. Hanks embodies all of what is good and right to this character, while still making him a real person. Hanks, no doubt, will be named an Oscar nominee for this performance - but it is in what category that might be a surprise to most.For, it will be as Supporting (not Lead) Actor for this is NOT a movie ABOUT Mr. Rogers. It is a movie that Mr. Rogers plays a strong Supporting part.This film is about the real, true-to-life relationship that Fred Rogers forged with troubled writer Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys). Vogel is assigned by his boss at Esquire (Christine Lahti - who it was GREAT to see in a film) to do a quick ""puff piece"" on Rogers. This hard-boiled reporter is hell-bent on peeling the layers back on this man. The surface of Mr. Rogers is just ""too good to be true"" to this writer. What happens, of course, is that Fred Rogers peels back the layers on Vogel to help him understand his troubled relationship with his father (Chris Cooper) - and it is this relationship that is at the heart of this movie.And heart is what is at the center of this film. This film is filled with love, understanding, warmth and HEART in abundance. Fred Rogers helps Lloyd Vogel to slow down and understand - and deal with - his feelings that are impeding his relationship with his father. And it is this heart and warmth that touched me. I was brought to the edge of tears more than once during the course of the 1 hour and 49 minute length of this film (and I am not a cryer) it was that well done - and emotional - without being cloying.Credit Writers Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster (both of TV's TRANSPARENT) for adapting Tom Junod's real life Esquire article on Rogers in such a way that it is powerful, thoughtful and effective. They accomplished this by placing the events of this film, loosely, in the format of Rogers' beloved TV show and it worked well.What also worked well was the Direction of Marielle Heller (CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME) like her previous film (which garnered Melissa McCarthy a well deserved Oscar nomination), Heller keeps her camera relatively still and lets her actors act - relying on tight. lingering close-ups and lingering, quiet pauses for the full effect of the emotions behind the words to land on the audience and resonate.She would not be able to do this without a strong cast - and a strong cast she has. Besides Hanks, Matthew Rhys (TV's THE AMERICANS) is a steady calm. angry presence that anchors the film in the ""no way Mr. Rogers can be that nice"" mindset that almost all of us have at the beginning of the film to be slowly peeled away to reveal what is really causing the anger and cynicism emitting from his character. The always reliable Chris Cooper (Oscar winner for ADAPTATION back in 2002) brings pathos and regret as Jerry Vogel, Lloyds father. The relationship between these two is the balancing point of this film and it is balanced well. They are joined by a strong list of Supporting Actors (like Enrico Colantoni, Susan Kelechi Watson and Wendy Makkena) that bring strength and warmth to the proceedings without stealing focus on the main players. They all are SUPPORTING players and they SUPPORT the events of the film wonderfullyI strongly urge you to see this film in a ""closed environment"" - a movie theater, in a darkened room - without distractions (turn off your phone, close the shades if you are home) and let the warmth, gentleness, humanity and slow-pace wash over you. You'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A- (Did I mention that this film is paced VERY slowly)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

92,Danusha_Goska,The Movie America Needs Right Now,8,28 November 2019,"""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is the movie America needs right now. Just go see it and don't even bother reading the rest of this review. It's okay if you have no idea what the movie is about. Really. Believe me.In ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,"" Tom Hanks gives the performance of a lifetime as Mr. Rogers, a beloved American children's TV icon. Hanks inhales and exhales Rogers, and somehow manages to ice the cake with his own unique Hanksian genius. Fred Rogers was a devout Christian. He demonstrated, rather than preached, Christianity. The Mr. Rogers of ABDITN is a saint, in the very best way. He brings joy and hope to those around him, often in surprising ways. And, yes, that is why you should see ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."" That part of the movie earns a 10 out of 10.The rest of the movie is standard-issue soap opera, and it's more of a 7 out of 10. Matthew Rhys stars as Lloyd Vogel, a cynical, muckraking journalist who is assigned to profile Mr. Rogers. I don't know if Rhys is a good actor. Maybe director Marielle Heller told him to mope so that the viewer would know that Lloyd is a tortured soul. In any case, Rhys mopes. He looks sad and unkempt. He is abrupt with others.In real life, people who have hidden wounds often do not look sad all the time. Rhys' one-note performance doesn't open any windows of insight into what it's like to have had an abusive parent.Susan Kelechi Watson plays Lloyd's wife Andrea. These two never convey the chemistry of a married couple in a complicated relationship. Watson looks picture-perfect in every scene. Her makeup is perfect; her clothes are pristine. She's supposed to be playing an attorney and new mother. Totally not believable to anyone who has spent any time with a new, working mother.Watson's and Rhys' shared scenes left me cold and confused. What are they to each other?Chris Cooper plays Lloyd's abusive dad, Jerry, who comes back into Lloyd's life. Again, I just didn't feel that anything real was at stake in these scenes.The domestic strife scenes in this movie struck me as paint-by-numbers, as someone writing in a writing class, someone who hasn't really lived or felt the material but knew that a thrown fist and an illness diagnosis would get paint-by-numbers reactions from the audience.My other concern is more about substance than style. The movie sends the message that if you are nice to people, even people who have proven themselves to be unreliable, those people will be nice to you back.In fact in real life one of the key lessons of being abused is ""Don't allow yourself to be vulnerable to abusive people, and yes sometimes you have to walk away and not look back.""So, no, the rest of ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" does not live up to Tom Hanks' terrific performance, or Mr. Rogers living out of Christian values. But that's okay. Go see the movie anyway. And bring a hankie.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

95,bob-the-movie-man,"""Anything mentionable is manageable""",7,13 December 2019,"Tom Hanks' new movie is a film I personally struggled to fully engage with. But some I suspect will truly LOVE it's gentle and feel-good nature.Who WAS Fred Rogers? Based on a true story this movie very quickly makes you realise that Fred Rogers, who died in 2003, was an American legend. This is supported by the GLOWING reviews here on IMDB by US viewers. Rogers was a children's TV presenter that used puppets and song to help children work through their fears and psychological issues. I suspect, like me, most Brits would say ""WHO?"" (Just as if a 60's born Brit like me saying ""Let's look through the arched window"" will similarly get a ""WHAT?"" from nearly all Americans!)Here the story revolves not around Fred (Tom Hanks) helping a child with issues, but with Fred's fixation with 'Esquire' journo Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), who is fighting his own demons of anger, resentment and pain. For Lloyd is struggling not only with his feelings about fatherhood, with the normal strains that is placing on the relationship with wife and mother Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson), but also with the reemergence on the scene of his estranged and hard-drinking father Jerry (Chris Cooper).The movie starts (and continues) with model sets reminiscent of the brilliantly barmy ""Welcome to Marwen"" and (the rather more subtle) ""Game Night"". Fun is had with matchbox-car freeways and planes flying off and clunking down on model runways.We join Mr Rogers on set filming his series: and the movie sloooooows to match Rogers' leisurely pace. This was a movie I went into completely blind (which is unusual for me): I knew precisely zip about it. No knowledge of Rogers. No knowledge of the story. No sight of the trailer. Nothing. So these opening scenes were a real ""WTF"" moment as my brain struggled to work out what the story was all about.There was undeniably something creepy about seeing the saintly Fred Rogers engaging with sick and vulnerable children. And I realised just what damage the likes of the convicted-paedophiles Jimmy Saville, Stuart Hall and Rolf Harris have done to my suspicions against all such entertainers. I feared - without any background knowledge on Rogers - that the story would take a darker turn. But no! That's not the story....For as mentioned earlier, this is the story of Lloyd. And it's a relatively simple and linear story of familial stress that we've seen in movies throughout the decades. Whether you will buy into this story-within-the-story, or not, will flavour your overall enjoyment of the film.Many who are into analysis and 'talking treatments' will - I think - appreciate the script. But I personally didn't really warm to any of the players - other than Rogers - so this was a negative for me. And I found the pace so slow that I ended up a bit fidgety and bored moving into the second reel of the film. Two women got up and walked out at that point - - it was clearly not for them (this was a Cineworld ""Unlimited"" pre-release screening).The third reel rather pulled it together again, and established an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" style of feelgood that I warmed to much more.This is a movie I predict the Academy will love. And everyone loves Hanks already. Read the tea-leaves. It's a brilliant performance from Hanks in its stillness and quietness.No more so than in one particular scene....This is the follow up movie from Marielle Heller to the impressive ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"". And this particular scene - let's call it the ""Anti-When-Harry-Met-Sally"" moment - is a massively brave and striking piece of cinema.It's truly extraordinary and worth the price of a ticket alone.In summary, I enjoyed this movie, primarily for watching the master Hanks at work. The pacing for me was somewhat off though. But I can't be overly critical of such a warm-hearted movie. I predict you will see this and go home with a big dose of the warm-fuzzies.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

97,kjproulx,"A Wonderful, Calming Film",9,16 December 2019,"When it comes to showcasing famous figures in narrative films or documentaries, Mr. Rogers seems to be a very popular one to tackle. Whether you're looking back on the great kids show or watching the documentary from last year called Won't You Be My Neighbor?, he is just a man that makes for a moving story. When I heard they were going to be making a film based on a time in his life and have Tom Hanks portray him, I was completely sold. As far as Hollywood film stars go, Tom Hanks is as close to Mr. Rogers as you can possibly get in my opinion. While aspects of this film may feel predictable, it's undeniably likeable from start to finish.Following a young journalist in Lloyd Vogel (known as Tom Junod in reality), as he struggles with his anger, his job, and his family life, he is tasked with interviewing Fred Rogers for the magazine that he works for. Not wanting to do it, he begins to realize that this kind-hearted man may be who he has needed all along. From this point on, the film becomes fairly predictable, but some of the best movies out there are predictable as well. I'm not going to overstate my enjoyment of this film and call it a masterpiece by any means, but it really is an enjoyable piece of filmmaking.It should come as no surprise that a review of this film would include some praise for Tom Hanks as Fred Rogers, but he truly is spectacular as this character. His awards praise is very much warranted and there were quite a few moments where he managed to bring a few tears to my eyes. With that said, I must admit though, Matthew Rhys who plays the reporter in this film was actually out of this world. Having only seen him in a few films before this role, I can officially say that I want to seek out his projects from now on. His commitment to this character made the movie that much more engaging.After the release of Diary of a Teenage Girl, director Marielle Heller made one of my favourite films of 2018 in Can You Ever Forgive Me?. After really enjoying her debut and loving her second outing, I was very glad to see that she was tackling this movie and she didn't disappoint. Although a very quiet and simple movie, her sensibilities really shined. I will always look forward to her future works from here on out. It's not very often these days when directors really stand out to me, but in terms of indie dramas, Heller is one to keep an eye on.In the end, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood isn't a film that will ever be known as one of the best films of 2019, but one of the sweeter movies of the years for sure. For those who share the same issues as the central character, this movie will definitely serve as a sort of therapy. It's a very calming movie that will make most viewers smile throughout the majority of the run time. Personally, I found myself relaxed and loving every minute of it, even though I knew where it was going from the very beginning. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood isn't perfect by any means, but it's very, very good and it features some stellar performances.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
98,tm-sheehan,A great double Act ! Hanks & Rhys,8,23 January 2020,"My Review - A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood
My Rating. 8/10The trailers for A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood didn't really make me think ""oh this is a movie I really must see"" but the cast headed by Tom Hanks as Fred Rogers the much loved children's television host and Matthew Rhys as Lloyd Vogel the cynical slightly bitter journalist who's boss assigns him to interview Mr Rogers for a Cover issue of Esquire magazine titled Can You Say Hero convinced me to see it.At first I must admit Mr Rogers appearance and voice grated on me I thought I was in for Tom Hanks revisiting Forest Gump and plonking himself in a Television studio a quarter of a Century later at first I was reminded of the famous line from Forest Gump that ""Life is Like a Box of Chocolates ""As the film progresses Mr Rogers kind caring and frankly dull character become his greatest charm as the layers of his character as well as the layers of Lloyd Vogel's character are exposed to the audience.
Mr Rogers is no edgy Mary Poppins and certainly not practically perfect in every way although he does sing and I just read the subway train scene did actually happen as this film is based on fact.The investigative journalist character Lloyd Vogel played brilliantly by Welsh Actor Matthew Rhys is based on the actual journalist Tom Junod who's 1998 article for Esquire ""Can You Say Hero "" inspired the character I don't know if his background story in the movie is factual or not but it's very moving a little confronting if you had a difficult relationship with your father like I did . However it's the perfect way to portray the effect and influence and empathy that Mr Rogers demonstrated in his lifetime.
He certainly wasn't known in Australia so it's interesting to see a famous American personality story that must mean so more to those who followed Mr Rogers television programs ""Mister Rogers Neighbourhood ""which ran for 912 episodes from 19th February 1968 till 31 August 2001.I notice Tom Hanks is nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award this year I don't know how they work that one out as he and Matthew Rhys both play equal major roles and both deserve a nomination in the main Actor category.
I think this will be Matthew Rhys breakthrough role as a major movie star . We have enjoyed him for years in the series Brothers and Sisters as Kevin Walker and many other movie appearances like The Post, and his Golden Globe nominated role in the Television series The Americans , Burnt (2015) and many great supporting roles .
This film however is a starring role and he matches Tom Hanks who we know is one of the great Cinema Stars on the planet scene for scene.Special mention also must be made for Chris Cooper who plays Jerry Vogel Lloyds problematical father seen recently as Mr Laurence in Little Women he has an unattractive character role but plays it so well. Also giving a lovely performance as Andrea Vogel the patient wife who is trying to make peace with father and son is Susan Kelechi Watson I'll look forward to seeing her in more movies in the future.I'm championing Women Directors at the moment seeing they're being ignored by the Academy Award selectors and Marielle Heller who also directed the wonderful ""Can You Ever Forgive Me"" has done it again with this expertly crafted film.
From the opening scenes of a children's dream toy town where everything is perfect and to scale to the every day reality of harsh city life this movie proves you can have a truly beautiful day in the neighbourhood no matter where you are.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Who used to teach subtle lessons through his children TV shows
A cynical Journalist Lloyd Vogel with a broken past with his father - goes to interview Fred Rogers and makes an uncanny friendship with him, which not only changes and transforms him, but makes him reconcile with his father who had abandoned him with his dying mother.
Fred Rogers was played beautifully by Tom Hanks.
and the Journalist Lloyd is played by Matthew RhysIt is like a children's fable on self - introspection and self- growth
The movie was inspired by the Journalist's article on Fred RogersFred Rogers - is shown as an insightful person - who can see through people and their miseries and uses his kindness and grace to change and transform people.
The beautiful thing was - instead of the journalist Lloyd asking question - the easy going non-defensive Fred Rogers personal style of probing connected him with people without being too intrusive.The transformation too is gentle and subtle - like True LOVEz
One line in the movie says - ""YOU'll know it when it will happen""A good person may be suspected and doubted as fake and manipulative - but little more engagement - you will know - the true personality and if it is good - one can not get touched by the LOVEz shownJust like how LOVE always has a positive long-lasting effect of people who are LOVEDzFred Rogers used his style of LOVE to change people's lives foreverIn the end - the movie leaves in us - a beautiful message of ETERNAL LOVE and the worth of putting LOVE over and above every other emotion we have come across in our life.I will go with 7.15 stars out of 10",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

105,MrDHWong,"A heartwarming, emotional story about how one man's teachings can help all of us to better ourselves",9,28 December 2019,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a biographical drama film based on the Esquire article ""Can You Say ... Hero?"" by Tom Junod. Starring Tom Hanks and Matthew Rhys, it is a heartwarming, emotional story about how one man's teachings can help all of us to better ourselves.In 1998, Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), a journalist for the popular magazine ""Esquire"", is assigned to interview and write a 400 word article on Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks), the host of the beloved children's TV series ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"". Upon meeting for the first time, Lloyd is surprised to discover that Rogers' kind, gentle demeanor is not merely a facade and that he truly acts this warmly to every person he encounters in real life. Over time, the two develop a close friendship and Lloyd starts to realise that he is becoming a better person as a result of embracing Rogers' teachings.As modest as its subject matter, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood successfully reassures what a genuine, sincere person Fred Rogers was and how he still has the power to affect anyone regardless of their age. Even though Lloyd is technically the main protagonist, the influence of Mister Rogers can still be felt coursing throughout the film every step of the way. We watch as Lloyd deals with his family troubles by listening to the advice he is given and in turn, there is so much that we too can take away from Lloyd's experiences in that it is never too late to heed the words of Mister Rogers, no matter what stage we are in our lives.Director Marielle Heller chooses to frame the film almost in the style of an actual episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which, while an unusual creative decision, actually benefits the film greatly. This is due to the fact that the show was structured as something both educational and entertaining at the same time, which biographical films of this type also have a tendency to do. This allows the audience to become invested in the plot while also absorbing the life lessons and advice given to them in a subtle manner, so much so that they may not even realise it.There's no question about it that Tom Hanks is the absolute perfect person for the role of Fred Rogers. He truly becomes this wonderful man in just about every aspect, from his outwardly friendly disposition to his slow, easy to understand manner of speech. It is easy to see why Fred Rogers' widow Joanne approved of the producers' decision to cast Hanks to play her late husband. Also worth mentioning is Matthew Rhys as Lloyd. Despite being a fictional composite character for the actual writer of the article this film is based on, Lloyd still comes across as a realistic person with relatable issues that regular people can identify with.Overall, whether you grew up watching Mister Rogers or had never heard of him prior to this film, this is definitely worth seeing for the sake of learning how to deal with our problems in a way that would make him proud. I also recommend checking out the documentary ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"" as a companion piece to this film, as it touches further upon Rogers' legacy in ways that this film did not. Fred Rogers truly was one in a million who brought joy to millions of children and adults alike and even though he has long since passed on, he will always be our neighbor.I rate it a solid 9/10",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

107,Alexander_Blanchett,Two worlds merge,8,5 January 2020,"A very charming insight into the world of child show host Fred Rogers and into the soul of an magazine author who told his story.
The film works on two layers... first as a biopic but secondly and that is more the focus it handles about a man who needs to tidy up his inner world so he has a chance for a future without losing everything around. And he manages that with the help of good hearted Mr. Rogers.
Tom Hanks brilliantly plays marvelous Mr. Rogers. It is truly one of his best performances in years and he is the most perfect choice to play that role. Regarded as the kindest and most hearted stars of of all Hollywood stars playing the known as most minded and good hearted hosts of all times. And still it was not Tom Hanks playing Fred Rogers, actually Tom Hanks was becoming Fred Rogers. Seeing a famous face and actor like Hanks totally losing himself in that role, forgetting his own famous mannerisms and transforming into this other famous person was just a brilliant thing to see. Hanks really deserves all the acclaim he gets for the role. But there was also Matthew Rhys, who sometimes was a bit one-sided, who still brought us an interesting character. Last but certainly not least Chris Cooper is back with a very good and absolutely memorable performance.

We've all watched his shows, and if we haven't, we all know the song that the title to this movie is based on. And if you don't know even that, then believe me ... you are in the minority. I can't really say I grew up on Mr. Rogers. I remember watching his show as a kid, but he never really was a personal favorite of mine. I wasn't really into Sesame Street either. My show of choice back in those days was Electric Company. ""Hey - you - guys!"".And yet, here comes this documentary on Fred Rogers. It isn't his life story, but rather, it showcases Mr. Rogers during the time when Esquire magazine was doing a piece on heroes, and Fred Rogers was one of those interviewed. To be honest, the movie really isn't about Mr. Rogers at all. It is more about the impact that he had on real life reporter, Tom Junod (represented by the fictional character of Lloyd Vogel), his family, and his life. At first, when Lloyd is given the assignment, he regards it as ""fluff"" and below him. This turns out to be the most difficult assignment of his career.I remember the simplicity of Mr. Rogers and his television show. In fact, it was almost borderline ""uncomfortable"" for me to watch. It moved extremely slow and felt stilted, unnatural. After having seen this movie though, I've gained a deeper appreciation for the man and what he was trying to do for kids, and ultimately, what he did do. It really is amazing that his show ran for so long and everything he accomplished in his lifetime. But, like I said, this movie was more about Lloyd and his family. Mr. Rogers never had quite that affect in my life, but I can appreciate what he's done over the years.Tom Hanks was excellent in the role, as were all the supporting actors. The movie really does capture the man and his legacy. The approach the film takes as being one large episode on the show was brilliant. The movie moves along at a deliberate pace, but then again, that's how he was. Yet, it does not lose its viewer and it will make you smile and admire what he did. I highly recommend this movie. 8 stars out of 10.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

113,garethcrook,Mr Rogers would be proud.,8,27 March 2020,"I didn't grow up with Fred Rogers. I've never even heard of him in the UK. As a result there's no real nostalgia, which I suspect this delivers in spades for a US audience. I still recognise the charm of revisiting the past though and the simplicity of children's television is pretty universal. Nick Drake rolls over the opening credits, this can only ever be a great thing and I'm hopeful, but wait a minute. What follows is a little unusual, essentially a film structured around a children's show, 'let's go the window' stuff, into real world scenarios. Those scenarios though follow Lloyd, a writer, doing a story on... Mr Rogers, it's all very post-modern, but subtle enough to avoid distraction. Lloyd's life isn't simple either, extended family tension, a new baby, his complicated life is totally at odds with the calm simplicity of Mr Rogers. I've never seen Fred Rogers on TV, but I'm lead to believe that Tom Hanks' portrayal is eerily accurate, which if true is quite remarkable. Fred Rogers is... well... unique. Gentle, understanding, insightful, disarmingly humble. The glass isn't half full, it's bottomless and always brimming. Lloyd doesn't really understand this, his work is about digging, finding the truth. When asked for a simple profile piece on Rogers, his cynical nature struggles to take Rogers at face value, I completely understand this, Rogers doesn't seem real. But even so, a scene with Fred and Lloyd on a subway train being sung to by the whole carriage seems totally believable, plausible, no Hollywood schmaltz. It's a battle between Fred and Lloyd, who's really profiling who, lost in probing personal conversations that Lloyd indulges in to further his work, but Fred expertly navigates to help his new friend. What's he hiding? Is he hiding anything? It seems like Lloyd is in touch with his feelings, they're raw on the surface, whilst Fred, well does he have any, he's so robotic, sweet but robotic. Of course the truth is they're both in touch, in different ways and more connected than Lloyd at the start of the process could ever imagine. It's beautifully effective, arresting, packed with heart, soul, grit and drama. Wildly inventive, much more than the sum of its parts and much much more than simple nostalgia. I dare you to watch this without smiling, without crying, without being moved. I imagine if Mr Rogers were with us today, he'd be immensely proud.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

115,jwwalrath-227-85487,Uplifting film,9,8 December 2019,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, inspired by a true story, is about how children's host Mr. Rogers (Tom Hanks) helps jaded journalist Lloyd Vogel (The Americans' Matthew Rhys) deal with his issues. This is just a really well-made film.This may be the feel-good film of the year. Beautiful Day is an extremely sentimental, and possibly tear-jerking, look at self-improvement. Rogers' nuggets of wisdom are really persuasive and a highlight of the film.That having been said, the movie could've been a little shorter. Vogel's negative traits are showcased so much that they get redundant. The scene that introduces the character's issues with his father never feels quite natural.Director Marielle Heller (who also did Can You Ever Forgive Me) has created a tightly edited and shot film. The whole thing looks nice. The moments where Rogers is filming his show really look like the original PBS airings. There are some creative and indie-style visual and presentation choices in this. (The film isn't too indie if that's not your thing and you were worried.) Music is real strong.There is some great acting in this. Now admittedly, Hanks can't fully replicate Rogers. The actor's large rectangular head just doesn't match, and he is unable to nail the voice. Still, it is an excellent performance; one of Hanks's best. Wouldn't be surprised if he got a best supporting actor nomination for this. He has Rogers' mannerisms nailed down. Hanks really encapsulates the man and brings such nuance, tackling both the empathy and wisdom of the man while also the melancholy aspects and the fact that he was odd. Hanks blends these facets so effortlessly. He truly gets lost in the part.Chris Cooper is also pretty versatile himself as Vogel's estranged father. Though she isn't in this much, Maryann Plunkett does a good job as Rogers' wife Joanne. Although Rhys and Susan Kelechi Watson, who plays Vogel's wife, are decent actors, they never quite shine as much as a lot of the rest of the cast.Overall this is just a really well made film and I recommend this.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
116,andrewroy-04316,"Sure, it's predictable, but it's a perfect representation of Mr. Rogers' human values, and Heller knows how to make this story work",7,5 February 2020,"Heller knows how to take interesting but challenging to adapt subject matter and turn it into a really good movie, between this and Can You Ever Forgive Me? Everyone knows who Mr. Rogers is and how he cares for people, so I was skeptical about how Heller would put a fresh spin on it. By focusing on Rhys, a cynical adult above Mr. Rogers' ""hokey"" kids show, Heller drives home how the values we tell children about embracing our feelings and communicating are essential to all people. You know how the story will go, more or less, but it still does manage to draw you in through the genuine frustration and pent up anger felt by Lloyd. Heller does an excellent job with the aesthetic choices, both in terms of lighting and the transitions between the puppet Neighborhood scenes and the regular scenes. Hanks and Rhys both give very good performances here, and I would not have minded the movie getting a few more nominations overall (maybe take some away from the disappointing Jojo Rabbit, which I watched last night). Just like in last year's documentary Won't You Be My Neighbor, Mr. Rogers' nuance and willingness to engage with dark themes came through clearly. The film is really an exemplification of the effect Mr. Rogers and his beliefs have on so many people. I'm wavering between a 7 and 8, leaning 7 because while it nails its goals, it doesn't add all that much beyond a commitment to being honest about your feelings, no matter your age.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

118,baileycrawly,Profound,8,18 March 2020,"""Moving"" is perhaps too weak and adjective to describe this film and yet, having come fresh off a viewing, this film was nothing short of moving.
There are a ton of take-aways from this movie and, just like the show Fred dedicatedly ran for years and years, applies to everyone regardless of age. There are so many different messages throughout this film that there's something in it for everyone. Prior knowledge of Fred Rogers isn't even essential to enjoy this film (although it's infinitely better if you know who is being portrayed).
Going into the film, I was (understandably, I think) nervous about Tom Hanks portraying such a beloved figure. Sure, he had the acting capabilities for it (it's Tom freakin' Hanks, after all), but he didn't particularly look or sound the part. And yet, form the very beginning of the film, it didn't feel like I was watching Tom Hanks as Fred Rogers, it felt more like I was watching Fred himself. There's a certain embodiment of the persona that Hanks underwent in the preparation for this role that made it an accurate portrayal worthy of Fred Rogers. One couldn't help but believe that, had Fred lived to see this production himself, he would've been honoured to have been portrayed in such a humbling, honest way... and with some of his own trademark messages weaved throughout the plot.
This is a movie that isn't afraid to be dark and heavy, jumping headfirst into some extremely difficult topics, just like the show. But they're important issues that pertain to everyone, with a fantastically written story to surround Fred's part.
Mr. Rogers, in this film, feels very much like a secondary character, a bit of subplot, a character put in place to bring peace and healing into a difficult situation. And that's exactly what this film was for me.
It was worth every penny. It touched a part of me that no other film has been able to touch. It inspired me to actively work on being a better person and being a better friend for those I care about. It healed a wound in me.
An actor would be extremely blessed to have one role like this in their career. Tom Hanks has had repeated attempts to play these kinds of things, touching the hearts and souls of everybody who watches. And, once again, he does his job with precision, always on cue and doing exactly what he needs to do at the right time. Bravo to Tom Hanks and everybody involved on this production.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
119,J_Batek_II,The Most Impressive Acting Performance By Tom Hanks Since 'Cast Away' (2000).,7,1 June 2020,"It took Tom Hanks 19 years to create another truly 'stand-out- performance'. He has had many great roles, but not like 'Forest Gump' (1994), or 'Cast Away' (2000)... No, roles like those define a career, and not many actors even get 1 'stand-out performance' in a 'stand-out role' in a 'stand-out' film. Tom Hanks has now had three such performances.I have spent years calling Tom Hanks ""Bosom Buddy"", and have been very critical of him. He and Spielberg beat me over the head with 'Band Of Brothers' (2001), and he and Ron Howard intentionally watered-down the Dan Brown stories - 'DaVinci Code' (2006) and 'Angels & Demons' (2009). But, he also made this film, so maybe it's time I give him a bit of a break...Perhaps a person needed to watch 'Mr Roger's Neighborhood' (1968-2001) as a child to fully appreciate Hanks' performance here...

121,MovieCriticOnline,I wanted to like this... but,1,30 December 2019,"The way the writer approached this bio was just odd. It should have been about Mr. Rogers, but instead the angle was from a ""fictional"" journalist, which takes me to the second problem, which is it was supposed to be based on a true story, but they decided to make the actual real person (Tom Junod) who wrote the actual story in Esquire and turn him into a fictional character (Lloyd Vogel) and the only reason I could see was to make this another Hollywood politically correct film by adding a black woman to the cast as his wife to ""add color"". If they had stuck to the real story they couldn't have added the black woman in.Hollywood needs to stop casting people based on their color, gender and sexual orientation. It always feels forced and inauthentic. It's annoying. There are so many stories that can be done with including whoever you want, but don't change real life to fit your PC culture. Normally I couldn't care less what race or gender you are, but lately (last 5 years or so) it seems like every film is being cast BASED on PC identity.Tom Hanks was also kinda annoying. He played it too nice, but not in a genuine way. Something was off. They almost made Mr. Rogers look mildly dumb. Like he is just clueless. They way he spoke, like he was dying or mumbling was just weird. It didn't sound like Mr. Rogers.The overall energy was so slow and low.It was so cringeworthy. I wish they had taken a whole different approach and maybe showed how he became Mr. Rogers, instead of this ""Almost Famous"" approach. There was no magic there. This is not even for kids. It was boring and dull.Why should we care or want to care about this nobody journalist?? No one wanted to see that.Let me quote Sean Burns, film critic, as he nailed it: ""There's a reason 'Citizen Kane' didn't devote half the movie to the home life of the reporter investigating Rosebud.""It was just BIZARRE!!

122,akcenat,What a lovely film in every sense of the word - uplifting tribute and an absolute delight,9,18 July 2020,"Based on an Esquire Magazine article, 'Can You Say ... Hero?' by Tom Junod, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is focusing on Fred Rogers' impact on one man, telling a personal story about how he changed the life of a person whose heart had been broken seemingly beyond all repair. Whether you know a little or a lot about 'Mister Rogers', there's nothing that will prepare you for the emotional experience in this neighborhood, as the director makes it feel like catharsis made just for you, getting you to consider your own relationships with the people in your life and the strength of your kindness. Also, whoever made the casting decisions for this film, deserves a standing ovation. Tom Hanks here is slow, softly-spoken and syrupy-sweet that it takes some getting used to but there is a crucial, subtle sadness behind his eyes. This is never overplayed, but it makes a world of difference to how we view him. Almost everybody else here is also perfect. Actually, everything about this film feels cosy and heart warming. Despite some flows, I cannot convey what an amazing experience this was. Joyful and heartbreaking and kind and hopeful and funny all at once. And yes if you have heart you will cry.

It is true, as others have pointed out, that the female roles are ciphers, which might be considered a surprising weakness in a film directed by a woman.

125,david-meldrum,"We Need More People Like Mr Rogers, And More Films Like This",9,18 August 2020,"I should have no emotional connection to the subject of this film - as someone born and bought up in Britain, I had barely heard of Ted Rogers and his television programme for children until a couple of years ago. I am also less inclined - like most of us - to accept or trust a story where the central character is presented to us as simply good, and along with that, that the shadow he casts on those with whom he comes into contact is also for the better. That I was deeply moved by this film, then, is a testament to many things The performances from Tom Hanks in the central role and the always under-appreciated Matthew Rhys playing the journalist who is writing a magazine feature about him are both superb. The direction is tender and subtle, the production design impeccable, the script deft. Much works that by rights shouldn't - the fade in from pictures of models (as were used on the original TV show) into real-life city scenes that mirror the models; the sub-plot of the journalist's relationship with his mostly estranged father; the minute of silence where Mr Rogers invites the journalist - and by extension, the viewer, as he spends about half that minute staring straight at us - to think about 'all the people who loved us into being'. I cried in that minute of silence - for my own reasons, and for the fact that we as a culture don't know what to do simple, honest, straightforward goodness. We want to look for the flaw rather than embrace the truly good, and it should be said that Mr Roger's flaws are hinted at occasionally here - not least in a moment of his piano-playing near the film's end. The film also shows that we do not know what to do with genuine silence - we avoid it, we fill it; anything to deny it. That this film ultimately touches on our mortality and does so in way that brings hope and light, with sensitivity and no schmaltz, is also remarkable. It's a film to move us, to touch us deeply - and to leave us feeling better than when we started. We need more of this in our lives.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

127,steiner-sam,I found Mister Rogers saccharine and manipulative,5,11 June 2021,"This is a biopic tangentially about Fred Rogers, though the focus is on a fictional journalist, Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), and his family in the late 1990s in New York City.Lloyd Vogel is an investigative journalist for ""Esquire"" magazine. He has a nonexistent relationship with his father, Jerry (Chris Cooper), who abandoned Lloyd and his sister, Lorraine (Tammy Blanchard), when their mother died. Lloyd is married to Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson), an attorney, and they have an infant son, Gavin.Lloyd and Andrea attend Lorraine's third wedding, where Lloyd has a confrontation with Jerry that results in a fight. Meanwhile, his editor has assigned him to do a puff piece on Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks), one in a series of American ""heroes."" Much of the film portrays the evolving relationship between Lloyd Vogel and Fred Rogers, especially as Rogers learns of Vogel's estrangement from his father. Rogers nudges Lloyd to come to terms with that relationship.One evening Jerry and his second wife are at Lloyd's home, and Lloyd confronts him about his mother's death. Jerry collapses, and the family learns in the hospital that Jerry has terminal heart problems. Lloyd can't bear to stay at the hospital and insists he needs to continue his interviewing of Fred Rogers in Pittsburgh, leaving Andrea alone at the hospital.Finally, Andrea and Lloyd come to a resolution, Lloyd goes to his father's home and stays with Jerry who is in palliative care, and they have a reconciliation. Fred Rogers shows up to bless it all.I will grant this was a compelling movie. I identified almost totally with Lloyd, as someone myself who internalizes emotions that sometimes has led to problems. The working out of family relationships in the Vogel family had a ring of truth to it.For me, the Fred Rogers character did not advance that truth. I found Mister Rogers saccharine and manipulative, in contrast to the praise that most reviewers have given the character. Indeed Tom Hanks was nominated for an Academy Award for his work, but I simply didn't find the character believable as he took oblique runs at Lloyd's psyche.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

132,jamiedarlow-37510,Sweet natured drama with surprisingly dark edges,6,13 March 2020,"Based on the real life icon Fred Rogers who was a children's television presenter most notable in America, this is the dramatised account of a journalist named Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) who is tasked to write an article on Mr Rogers for Esquire magazine. Through the experience, Lloyd's cynicism and hard exterior is hard to keep going in the face of Fred's wonderful outlook on life. It's beautifully directed by Marielle Heller (Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Diary of a Teenage Girl) who focuses on the quiet moments quite perfectly; the scene Lloyd and Fred share in a restaurant taking a minutes silence to remember 'the people who have loved us into being' is a brilliant emotional sequence. The ending is also a wonderful tracking shot that does the same thing without any words of dialogue. It's very well acted aswell with Hanks being perfect in the role, Rhys portraying someone extremely cynical but also allowing the audience to understand him at the same time and plenty of great supporting performances including from Susan Kelechi Watson and Chris Cooper. The only downfall is that the majority of the film is told from the perspective of Lloyd which can make the positive vibes Fred projects sadly dampened over when as a viewer you're trying to enjoy his company but it's no fault of the filmmaking itself as this has to be in place for the story to work; it just could've been more enjoyable. Overall, worth a watch and will probably find more of an audience when it's released for home viewing",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
133,flicklover,We need this man now!!!,10,15 December 2019,"I have very fond memories of watching Mister Roger's Neighborhood as a kid. It was at a time where kids actually played outside and weren't obsessed with watching a screen all day but I remember loving that show. Last year I saw the great documentary about Mister Rogers that gave insight into how much he actually cared about kids. It was endearing.When I first saw the trailer I saw Tom Hanks and was like, he doesn't resemble Fred Roger's AT ALL. Even though I know that in a biopic the actor doesn't necessarily have to look exactly like the person that is being portrayed but Hanks doesn't look like him. But knowing the great actor he is he would pull it off. And today that I saw the film after the first 20.minutes of sort of not buying Tom Hanks' performance he won me over in spades. The film isn't really a biopic about Fred Rogers life but about his friendship with a reporter named Lloyd Vogel ehich is based on a real reporter that had a friendship with Fred Rogers. The film is really about Lloyd and his very negative, angry look at the world. He is estranged from his father that abandoned him and his sister when their mother became sick. He us really angry with him and is in alot of pain but can't express it in a healthy way. He is tasked with interviewing Fred Rogers for a magazine piece on heroes. At first Lloyd resents having to do this assignment, trying to find anything wrong with Mister Rogers, he couldn't be really like he is on the show. From the beginning, Mister Rogers senses pain in lloyd and tries to make him open up. His calmness and happy disposition makes lloyd angry and uncomfortable. Slowly lloyd starts the let go, and he sees that Rogers is truly sincere. He finally begins to let go of his anger and begins to.forgive his dad played really well by Chris Cooper. Needless to say this film is predictable, but the subtle but powerful way that the story unfolds is really inspiring. There is a particular shot of Tom Hanks in this film that had me stunned with its gentle power. This film really stayed with me.For a more biographical look at Fred Rogers see the documentary.

134,PipAndSqueak,Being in the present,9,3 February 2020,"Tom Hanks is the only actor who could have played Fred Rogers with any kind of conviction and, he does so with convincing steadiness in this film. Mr Rogers clearly had a talent for being in the present and seeing people for where they were right then. We get hints that Mr Rogers had difficult passages in his own life and in bringing up two boys himself. We can guess why. Projecting 'future's' on to young minds doesn't help them deal with their present issues. This is what Mr Rogers has the good sense to spot. He's rather like a Dog Whisperer/Horse Whisperer wrapped in one Human Whisperer. He's not apparently sentimental - just realistic. Death is around the corner but it doesn't frighten him even though some of the people who he helps clearly are fearful. A beautiful film of compassion and understanding.

Tom gives a wonderful performance as playful and loving and understanding and the film focuses on the fact that Mr. Rogers played a role in so many on such large scale.

I guess Fred Rogers was truly a magnificent person and none other than the almighty Tom Hanks could have portrayed him better. Tom is the only actor who can really get to his viewer and literally everything his character says in this film to us from the screen is something to think about. Mister Rogers didn't want to change people, he wanted to make a difference, not to be like everyone else, just be himself and that's the most precious thing a person can ask for in a friend.

141,Hallelujah289,"Wholesome, inspiring, sometimes acutely bizarre",7,11 June 2021,"At times deeply affecting with strong (though implicit) undercurrents of Christian values, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is a mixed bag of forgiveness, and bizarre, shocking moments together with child's puppetry and toy model sets.On the one hand, you have a deeply troubled journalist experiencing a fragmented reality and a broken relationship with the drunken, cantankerous father he hates who wants back in his life. On the other hand, you have a fearless, nosy, but harmless children's TV host Mr Rogers who has too many puppets and who asks too many personal questions of the journalist meant to interview him about his shattering home life. It's unsettling when the two mesh at times, and the journalist experiences a moment of psychosis and faints during a day of the show's shooting.The other side of ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is jarring, as from the journalist's perspective Fred Rogers is freakish, but then to others he is like a second Christ of sorts with a kind smile, a warm air, and a constant desire to pray, aid, and reacquaint people with their own unique goodness and that of others who have helped them. The movie doesn't quite resolve the two perspectives of Mr Rogers as ""special"" in the other definition and as a one in a million messiah like figure. A proper resolution would have been he is just human, though he tries very hard to be kind to everyone. But the movie leaves an uncomfortable sense of peculiarity about Mr Rogers mixed in with a reverence that is probably over idealistic.Beyond this ambiguous portrait of Mr Rogers, the movie is less a biopic about Mr Rogers and more a drama of Fred Rogers the Presbyterian minister's (who kept his Christian ideology out of the tv show, but who was very much a man of God) fervent and privately held belief that every individual is a child of God. Or at least, that every individual was once a child, and are born with the same goodness. And thus, forgiveness is always possible and understanding always the aim, as we all have the same kind of emotional fabric. The movie at times successfully demonstrates these notions and has an optimism that is refreshing though sometimes not entirely convincing because of modern cynicism. However for anyone experiencing a broken family situation and desires to mend it, this might be an inspiring film.I like and appreciate this film, however I feel that it is sometimes twisted and full of uncertainties and perhaps less fully realized than it could have been. Do the filmmakers fully get and trust Mr Rogers? I'm not sure. But do they try to illustrate his core philosophy? Yes.The idea that every person deserves understanding is far more radical than is fully given credit. I believe it is not actually a popular idea given the prevailing disenfranchisement and disconnection in modern society. I think ""A Good Day in the Neighborhood"" makes a good attempt to get the message across, though the Christian feel of the film is sometimes off putting. Perhaps this film is like Mr Rogers in that it has both it's peculiarities and a good heart.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

He is too great for every role he plays and he pulls you right into his magic on screen.It's mesmerizing and makes you wonder about relationships around you, love that you receive or not receive, love that you give and tries to make you better person.

He was truly an amazing and exemplary human being. Anyone who does the least bit of study into his life, mission and legacy will come away impressed and inspired to become a better person. Mr Rogers is one of my heroes even though I did not grow up in the USA. In fact I have never even been there. Mr Rogers was not part of my childhood or, indeed, any part of my life. I don't know how I came across him and wanted to learn more about him, but I did.So, for all those reasons I really, really wanted to love this movie, I mean really love it. Sadly, I didn't. I didn't hate it, but I didn't come away inspired and touched as I had hoped to be. I knew Mr Rogers was not the main character in the movie. The movie wasn't about him. It was about the impact a person like him can make. I think a big part of my disappointment had to do with Tom Hanks portrayal of the great man. I just found his version of Mr Rogers to be very annoying. I am sure Mr Rogers was not like that at all. I don't blame Tom Hanks. I can't think of another actor who could have played the part. I think he was only working with the script he was given.The acting is good, the sets are fantastic, the music is appropriate but all I can say is if you want to see the real Mr Rogers then see the recent documentary, 'Won't You be My Neighbor' instead of this.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

146,peeedeee-94281,It's A Misleading Day In The Neighborhood,4,27 November 2019,"So, I'm going to be like many people who went into this film to see a biopic about Fred Rogers.WRONG!!This movie is about some guy who's writing an article on Mr Rogers for Esquire Magazine. The movie is about his life, and his family troubles. Mr Rogers is like his psychotherapist, trying to get him to forgive and make amends with his father before he passes.The movie was pretty much all over the place. The only good parts were when Tom Hanks as Mr Rogers was on screen. That literally was the only times when the movie was interesting. Whenever he was gone, it was just dragging. The family drama angle is so cliched, how many hundreds of movies have done father/son conflict plots?! The writer Lloyd Vogel was so selfish, you didn't care whether he got over his hang ups.I liked the recreation of the Mr Rogers set, but the segues using Mr Rogers Neighborhood type models of Pittsburgh and NYC, which were cute at first, became tiresome after awhile. As were some trippy moments where you think you're watching a recreation of the show, but its really Vogel's bad dream or acid trip.Also, this movie has like 2 or 3 false endings, or places where it should have ended. But it just keeps going and going and going lol. It's like a guy who can't wrap up his conversation, so he just keeps meandering along until someone cuts him off.And there is literally a one minute of silence. The director felt the need to actually have you sit and watch Fred and the writer guys sit at a booth, with no one making a sound, for a whole minute lol. Talk about padding a film!And in the end, we don't really get an idea of what was actually written about Fred Rogers in the article lol. All we know is that it was more than 400 words, and it was so well-liked it was on the front page, just like that. But we are led to believe the writer injected his own life into the article?! It didn't make any sense.Overall, a tonally uneven movie. What makes this film even more disappointing is that the same director did the vastly superior Can You Ever Forgive Me? last year. If Tom wasn't in this movie, it would be a 2/10 movie at best. It probably should have just gone straight to Netflix.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
147,Jared_Andrews,A Wonderful Story of How Mr. Rogers Made the World a Better Place,8,27 November 2019,"The Mr. Rogers movie isn't about Mr. Rogers.It's a story about a man named Lloyd. It's story of how Lloyd met Mr. Rogers, became his friend, and how Mr. Rogers saved Lloyd's life.Lloyd's life wasn't in danger in the literal sense. Lloyd didn't have a terminal illness for Mr. Rogers to cure. Lloyd didn't have suicidal thoughts for Mr. Rogers to quell. Lloyd's life was in danger in a different sense. He was in danger of losing himself and the things he cared about most.""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" tells the story of how Mr. Rogers helped Lloyd mend his psychological fractures and face the demons that had haunted him since his childhood. Through their relationship, we get a peek behind the curtain of the impact that Mr. Rogers had on the lives of the people he met on a daily basis. He helped many children, of course, but he also helped adults too.Some viewers may fret over Mr. Rogers' limited screen time in the film and the focus on Lloyd. I disagree. The time we spend with Mr. Rogers is plenty revealing and impactful. Lloyd is a sensible character on which to build a story, because he has glaring flaws and a development arc. The great legacy of Mr. Rogers is all the lives he touched and the good he gave the world. Lloyd's story provides a wonderful example.Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers is every bit as perfect as anyone would have guessed. He doesn't try to overplay it by doing an impression, mocking Rogers' body language and the like. What he does is find a way to capture the essence of Mr. Rogers, the beacon of positivity he became. The teacher. The friend. The nicest man in the world.That doesn't mean Mr. Rogers is perfect. He's not an angel born to be kind. He works on being kind every day. Only through consistent effort and intentionality of goodness does Mr. Rogers achieve his rightfully earned reputation. He serves as an example to all of us that we too can be kind, and we too can live the lives we want to live.It's perhaps the most inspirational and most important message we'll see at the movies all year.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

149,RhapsodyReviews,Beautiful Storytelling.,8,14 December 2019,"Review:
'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood' is a drama film directed by Marielle Heller.
I believe that this movie is a great film and was one that deserved to be told. Unfortunately for me I was expecting a different movie entirely than what I saw in the theater. I'm just not sure if it's a bad thing or not.
The movie depicts Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), a journalist for Esquire who is assigned to profile beloved television icon Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks).
Tom Hanks absolutely shines as he transforms into the beloved children's show star in a role his career has been perhaps always leading to. Hanks embodies all that is Fred Rogers, from his delicate mannerism to beautifully authentic warmth with others. Matthew Rhys (Lloyd Vogel) and Chris Cooper (Jerry Vogel) deliver outstanding ones. The father-son struggle presented in the film allows for each actor to flush out raw emotion that transcends with the audience.
Going into the movie I was expecting a biopic of Fred Rogers, but it's not that at all. It's about Matthew Rhys' character Lloyd Vogel and how he is struggling in his life until he meets Fred Rogers. The whole film is told as if it is one long episode of 'Mr. Rogers Neighborhood' and for the most part it did a great job. I'm just not sure if the way it was edited all together was for me. I was a big Mr. Rogers fan when I was a kid and as soon as the beginning credits started and there was a long scene with Tom Hanks talking as Fred Rogers, I got tears in my eyes. I actually teared up a lot throughout this movie, but it's never sad per se, it's just how the movie, and Tom Hanks in general makes you feel.
Overall, the movie did entertain me and that's what I look for most in a film. I went into this review thinking I was going to give the movie 3/5, but than I thought about it some more. The movie isn't going to be what you expect from the promotions for it. That's not a bad thing, it tells a different story, but one that makes you feel good and sad all at once. As I said, the editing for me didn't work in some cases, and took me out of the story that is being told. But, still recommend it to all Tom Hanks and Mr. Rogers fans. Or people who just need a reminder that being nice to others may be hard, but there is always a way to get there.

150,MickeyTheConstant,I would love to live in that neighbourhood,9,22 August 2020,"What a lovely movie. Feel good all the way and found myself having a bit of a cry at times (nice cry that is). Rogers just seemed like such a lovely guy. It's not really a biopic. Many events are true but did not happen as we see them and the journalists character although based on somebody real who wrote the famous article was mostly fictional as was his back story. This somewhat lessened my enjoyment of it when I found out. I also think it ended quite abruptly and maybe needed a few words at the end to let us know what happened after and a bit more about the great man. I found myself thinking about today's society. This movie is set in 1998, before social media. I found myself hating who we are now and getting angry thinking how Rogers probably would have been treated on Twitter and most likely trolled. I felt a sense of shame about modern society. Managing anger and negativity was partly what Rogers wanted to help teach and so it was a bit ironic in a way at the thoughts I had. Anyway, what a lovely lovely guy. Many should listen to his words and wisdom and learn from his faith, kindness and positivity. I wish there were more like him. A great watch, really enjoyable. Made me want to be a better person.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
151,Slarkshark,What a Legend,8,2 November 2021,"Personally I was more of a Mr. Dressup kid while growing up, being from Canada and all. I vaguely remember Mr. Rogers, but clearly not to the extent of everyone south of the border. Funny enough, I did know about the urban legend of him being this legndary sniper in the Vietnam War, and actually thought that was true until they cleared it up in the film. However, he's iconic and a straight up legend in every other way.Tom Hanks seems to have done a very respectable portrayal. Nailing those mannerisms and evoking that genuine kindness that Fred Rogers was known for would not be easy. That's why Hanks is truly one of the best and no stranger to huge amounts of kindness as well.It was treat to see a story like Lloyd Vogel's, which was just an example of how Mr. Rogers touched so many lives and had the ability to help heal them.The film is a great reminder of what this world lost when Fred Rogers passed away. The lessons he taught still apply today and we would do well to remember them.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

153,deadbull-95171,Great Hanks performance about a remarkable man,9,15 July 2021,"I was always dismissive of Mr. Rogers. I tended to Mock Captain Kangaroo and Bozo the Clown seemed like a drunk to me even as a child, Garfield Goose and all the rest...as an 8 year old I watched dramas and instructional TV although I liked the 3 Stooges.Only in the early 60's when Americans were allowed to express their mirth with inbred morons and mentally disabled people, did I begin to enjoy the stupidity of the American public. But Rogers was in his own category
with his Buddhist calm and infantile props and hyper-simplified sensibilities.It took this particular film, and reading the actual Esquire article written by the Vogel character, and trusting that Hanks, who epitomizes goodness, nobility, decency, and integrity, and who has his choice of roles, did I look more into this unique Fred Rogers person.The movie is a lightly fictionalized and surrealized composite of actual events, somewhat displaced in time but largely accurate. What Hanks misses in vocal accuracy he more then makes up for in style and inflection and nuance.The movie centers around the falsely named Vogel character's transformation by his growing relationship with Rogers. When he asks his wife what it's like to ne married to a Saint I was thinking that very thing.I suppose Fred Rogers was in fact a very quiet modest lovely hero, with a specific mission to very consciously use a media he innately disliked to become a tool to continually send out a message of the preciousness of life on this planet. The more I looked into it the more unique his Americanized media-Buddhism became something very genuine and irreducibly healing and exemplary in it's doomed message.It's an extremely gentle and touching movie, and it seems that as nice as it is, the real story and character was even more astonishing then this portrait. Friends with 2 USA President, all the talk show hosts, all children and people of all ages and all walks of life, there really was something totally authentic and excellent about this modest man who made the deepest introspection the same thing as his outward being and in becoming as close as possible to exactly who he was, became a beacon to millions of people.It's explained well in the movie and is very worth seeing. I think it's also worth the effort to look up the actual article that. Tom Junod wrote for esquire that became the Cover Piece and is a fine piece of journalism. Certainly the respect and affection he felt is oozing out between every well crafted line.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I won't say that the film is necessarily about Mr. Rogers at all, but rather it is about how deeply his mere presence can calm even the angriest of souls. I watched Mr. Rogers as a child, of course. I was there for his 9/11 announcement on television, urging children to seek comfort in their loved ones in time of peril. Tom Hanks seems to have done a very fair job in portraying him. While I will tip my hat to Tom for a job well done in the film, nothing will ever take the place of the real Fred Rogers. I encourage others to see it. Very rarely do films evoke any type of emotion from a person like me, one who doesn't care for such touchy feely things. I won't lie to you however.

158,gcsman,"A nicely done film, no doubt -- but lingering peculiarities",7,29 December 2019,"When I saw that Tom Hanks was cast to play children's icon Mister Rogers, I thought that was great. As far as I can tell, Hanks can do just about anything on screen and make it work, and he's got to be one of the most likable movie stars we've had since the days of Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda. But this role, I think, got away from him just a little. I'll say more below.Fred Rogers was the genuine article: a straightforward, kindly man who had a genius for relating to children. And he did that by taking them as they were -- not adults-in-training, but persons in their own right with their own hopes and fears and thoughts that he helped them to articulate. What you saw with him was what you got. His long-running TV show had a very strong appeal to the pre-school age group, with its utterly simple but utterly effective setup: the trolley and the Land of Make-Believe. King Friday XIII and Lady Aberlin. Picture Picture. Mr. McFeely and his mailings that would lead to little educational trips into the outside world. Older kids tended to move on to shows like Sesame Street and others, but Mister Rogers' Neighborhood gave them the solid base to draw from. If you want to learn much more about the show and about Fred Rogers himself, the recent documentary Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (2018) is an excellent source.Tom Hanks (as Fred Rogers) gets all the banner publicity for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, but in fact his part of it makes up less than half the film. First and foremost it's about journalist Lloyd Vogel (a surrogate for real-life writer Tom Junot) who is assigned to do a piece on Mister Rogers for Esquire magazine. Lloyd is, to say the least, troubled: he's got daddy and forgiveness issues big-time. In his interview sessions with Rogers, Lloyd finds himself very gradually and reluctantly brought into a healing space where he can finally overcome his personal demons. The great Chris Cooper (one of Hollywood's most underused actors) plays Lloyd's father exactly right, and Susan Kelechi Watson, as Lloyd's wife Andrea, also leaves a really strong impression. As Lloyd himself, Matthew Rhys does --- OK. He fits the role well enough, but when he's onscreen with these other powerhouse actors our attention tends to be pulled away towards them instead. Unfortunately there's just one scene where Hanks and Cooper, the two Oscar winners, are on screen at the same time.But now for Tom Hanks himself: you can see he does his absolute best to channel Fred Rogers right down to speech cadence and body posture that are meticulously recreated (and sometimes overdone -- if these mannerisms call attention to themselves, they're no longer natural). But his attempts at facial expressions that were supposed to be kindly and insightful instead looked calculating. So I think this role just got away from him a bit.Still, some individual scenes really stick in the memory. There's the New York subway scene where all the other passengers in the car, from old to young and black to white, recognize Mister Rogers and all burst into the theme song from his beloved show. Another is in a restaurant where Lloyd and Fred are continuing their conversation and Rogers invites them to be silent for one minute to think about ""... the ones who loved you enough to bring you into being. They will come to you."" As we wait the full minute, Rogers breaks the fourth wall by looking directly into the camera. We, the audience, are not allowed just to sit apart from the thoughts that are being worked out in the story.The very last scene has Fred Rogers idly playing on the piano in the darkened, deserted TV studio after taping a show. We know he's angry about something by the way he strikes the piano keys and that this is the way he works out his anger, but we are left not knowing exactly why.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Matthew Rhys had a solid performance too.

There was also some clever little bits in the film that made it better. In order to find these you really have to pay attention the whole time. The story was fantastic too.

163,theredsky,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Review,7,29 November 2019,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a wonderful tribute to Fred Rogers while also telling a good story about forgiveness and kindness. Obviously, Tom Hanks does a fantastic job. It's one of those few perfect casting decisions. I can see no one else playing Fred Rogers. The rest of the actors do a pretty good job but my issue is with some of the characters. Some of the characters are not memorable but Matthew Rhys' character was extremely unlikeable. The film tries to portray his character as unlikeable for the first part of the film but they did this a little too much to the point where I started dreading seeing him on screen. It does get better as his characters arc progresses but you don't want to make your character too unlikeable or the audience won't be able to sympathize with him. The story of the film is pretty good. I somewhat like seeing this overly pessimistic character being shown forgiveness and kindness from one of the nicest men on the planet. The film knows how to tug on your heartstrings and give a heartfelt story. Every word out of Tom Hanks' mouth is so impactful and powerful. There is a beautiful scene in the later half of the film where Tom Hanks talks about death. It was incredibly beautiful and powerful to me having had a relative pass away earlier this year. I also really enjoyed the opening 10 minutes. It's shot and looks like a Mister Rogers' episode that introduces the main characters and the main themes of the film which I thought was great. There a handful of technical aspects that I really appreciated or liked. When the film transitions to different locations, instead of showing shots of the city, it shows a model of the city created in a way that looks similar to the models on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. I thought the music was pretty good although not very memorable, same with the cinematography. If you love Mr. Rogers', then I think you might like this movie.

170,cappiethadog,A good man,7,23 January 2020,"Did you know Mr. Rogers moved out of his neighborhood? That's what we learn in Morgan Neville's documentary film ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"". To recharge his batteries, the popular, but burnt-out children's television host turned his attention towards grown-ups. WQED(Pittsburgh's public television affiliate) aired ""Old Friends, New Friends"" in primetime, but to Fred's disappointment, the show never caught on and was quickly cancelled. Yoyo Ma, the world-renowned cellist, describes Fred Rogers' interviewing style like this: ""He put his face about three inches away from my face and says, 'It's so nice to see you and to be with you.'"" And sure enough, real life is transposed into its Aristotelian counterpart: imitation, when in ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"", directed by Marielle Heller, Fred deflects Lloyd's questions about the burden of being famous, and turns the table another one-hundred-eighty degrees on the fluid interview, using a proxy, Daniel, a shy tiger who gets up close and personal with Lloyd's eyeballs, just like how Ma recounts his first meeting. The sock puppet, Mr Rogers' alter-ego, opens up the possibility of the angry son letting bygones be bygones, in regard to his broken relationship with Jerry(Chris Cooper). Whereas Fred ""scared the living daylights"" out of the cellist, Lloyd only expresses barely-concealed irritation at himself for allowing a children's toy dictate the interview. Daniel has two jobs; not only does the shy tiger function as a symbiotic performer, he's also a press agent who protects the puppetmaster from people asking questions about the toll that fame had on his two young boys. ""It wasn't easy living with the second Christ,"" the older son quips, in ""Won't You Be My Neighbor"". Margy Whitmer, Fred's producer, who has a cameo in the Chinese restaurant scene, describes her boss' interviewing style as being ""incredibly open"", so it's no wonder that ""Old Friends, New Friends"" failed to orientate adults to his philosophy. Like Peter Pan, in the flesh, Fred tried to remake adults as children, leading their return to innocence with unconditional kindness, which some people mistook as cloying. Most people want to put their childhood behind.Unbeknownst to an audience who never saw ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"", the scenes between Fred Rogers(Tom Hanks) and Lloyd Vogel(Matthew Rhys) have the meta-effect of being a television program within a movie, like the best ""Old Friends, New Friends"" episode that never was. The diegesis is an extension of the Land of Make Believe; scripted reality television that doubles as a biographical film. In plain sight, Rogers' greatest professional failure gets introduced as a ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" segment. Fred introduces a cutout paper house with window shutters that open and close. One window reveals an old friend; the benevolent despot King Friday the XIII. Lloyd, a new friend, occupies another window. Bill Eisler(Enrico Colantoni), the president and CEO of Family Communication, explains to Lloyd that his client picked him, the hard-scrabbled Esquire writer, in spite of his baggage and reputation, because ""Fred loves people like you."" Lloyd's narrative is captured by cameras in italics. Lloyd is the documentary subject, the star of ""Old Friends, New Friends"", in which the son deals with the paradox of having a father with terminal cancer he hates. Unaware as to what Bill meant by this sardonic aside, subsequent familial calamities beget a turning point, resulting in a father/son rapproachment, which makes Lloyd, now purged of his longtime grudge against Jerry, realize, in hindsight, that he was broken. In ""Won't You Be My Neighbor"", Fred is shown sitting down with a group of inmates at a high-security penitentiary, a judicious clip that underscores the show's fatal flaw. Whereas children have a fighting chance to remake themselves, adults for the most part come fully-formed, and Fred, in spite of his best efforts, has little chance to be an agent of change and have an impact on their lives. Lloyd knows what jail is like. The men in orange jumpsuits aren't going anywhere anytime soon. But in the investigative journalist's case, Fred helps orchestrate Lloyd's jailbreak from the prison of his own making. Forgiveness is the key.""Don't ruin my childhood,"" Andrea(Susan Kelechi Watson) whispers to her husband, at the outset of ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"", in the bedroom, in the dark. A man such as Lloyd likes the darkness. It's a muckraker's job to turn on all the lights and take note of the scattering rats. Lloyd isn't used to assignments, but Ellen(Christine Lahti), his boss, gives him one, to the muckraker's chagrin. He has to profile Fred Rogers, beloved children television host of ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood""; a puff-piece, she warns, as part of a series on American heroes, not an expose. As a point of reference, Lloyd, of course, fails to discover any skeletons in the closet of this television pioneer, but the film works as a jumping-off point, because scandal has left audiences deeply cynical about adults who like to be in the company of young people. Without irony, Fred asks Andrea, a new mom, if she considered preschool yet. She watches the news. The answer is no. Lloyd watches the news, too. ""This can't be for real,"" he asks aloud. But it is. ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" is a timely reminder of what human goodness looks like. It used to wear bad sweaters.""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" also works as a requiem for ""Old Friends, New Friends"", a reappraisal of the long-held notion that Fred lacked the emotional intelligence and capacity to help adults in real-life and through the medium of television.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
171,stevojaxon,Poorly executed reconciliation / forgiveness tale ... where is the 0/10 option?,1,18 February 2020,"Highlighting what is wrong with some Hollywood presentations now. Pretentious PC with its 'maybe you didn't notice' inter-racial marriage and background moralizing. Our 1920s hero displays 2019 characteristics in a 1998 setting. There is no integrity in such confusion. Hanks and Rhys are two good and smart actors who would have known what they were signing up for. That makes it even more laughable. To me it comes across as one doing it for the pay cheque and the other wanting to virtue signal to his peers. The production includes an irrelevant miniaturization sequence and the interchanging 4:3 to 16:9 screen format, to try to further the story. This gimmickry doesn't work. I have seen it in other movies and it's becoming a thing. This is a whimsical and weak movie. It pretends to be interesting but it is not honest in its intentions. This movie has been produced for a marketplace where considerable cultural re-education has supposedly taken place. As a consequence, it will receive positive feedback from those for whom it is tailored. However I found myself wanting it to hurry up and finish.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I never thought this movie makes me want to be like Mr. Rogers.This film is just beautiful. This film makes me want to cry. He was a man who was nothing but pure heart. I saw his TV shows and all of them are beautiful. I cried about everything in this movie. I just couldn't stop crying. I love the fact that Tom Hanks did nothing but a phenomenal job doing Fred Rogers. Everything about this movie I had no complains. This movie makes ME FEEL something.....HAPPINESS. I LOVE this movie. I don't know what to say this movie was made for Mr. Rogers himself. Please go watch this movie. Please give this money so the studio can do more movies like this. The Director needs to do more movies like this. Even if you saw it already see it again. This movie is beautiful. Please. Support a movie like this. Please I LOVE THIS movie near dear to my heart. I never cared about watching action movies or cared about racing or people with powers. I care about people being PEOPLE. I hope Mr Rogers watches this in heaven and not only appreciate it.

177,madanmarwah,"Mr Roberts, Lloyd and the interview",7,3 July 2020,"Frankly I saw this Tom Hanks film only for him, since I thought that anyone who could do "" Forrest Gump"", "" Cast away"", ""Terminal"", "" ""Captain Phillips"" or ""Sully "" had to be doing an excellent film. I was disappointed with what I saw in this film and maybe it did not require an actor of his calibre to essay the role of TV host of a kids program. Nothing wrong with the plot of Mr Rogers( Tom Hanks) getting interviewed by an unhappy journalist Lloyd Vogel who is going through a rough patch in his relationship with his father. Mr Rogers ends up interviewing Lloyd instead, and provides a healing touch to Lloyd's relationship with his father through his simplistic views on life. In a series of suggestions in his counseling, Mr Roberts manages to convince him to change his perspective of life. In the final scenes Lloyd forgives his father who had walked out on him and his mother to live with his girlfriend. Lloyd is now at peace with himself as he hands over his infant son to his dying father.
Tom Hanks has a laid back, philosophical character to play and with his robotic dialogue delivery, he just about manages to keep things moving. He carries puppets in his suitcase and asks Lloyd what his favourite toy was. The film is painfully slow at places. A song in the film brightens up the scenes. This film deals with how the dysfunctional relationship of father and son is healed by Mr Roberts. It is a story of compassion, kindness, and forgiveness . Maybe that is the beautiful part of the day.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
178,CriticalOfEverything,The first film I've seen in years that has deeply affected me.,10,1 February 2020,"This may get a little personal, but I've been suffering from severe depression and have had a lot of issues dealing with anger, sadness and all for about five years now. For the past 8 years of my life, and earlier years of my childhood, I have loved Fred Rogers. He always told me and millions of children all over the world that he likes us just the way we are, and taught us the power of kindness, positive ways of thinking and dealing with our emotions, and while I'll always be a cynic by nature, I've always tried to take what he taught me and many others to heart. He was genuinely the kindest, most loving and compassionate human being to ever grace this Earth. But over the past year especially, I've stopped caring about my life with tragedy happening around me constantly, making me feel like my life was falling apart, as well as me having thoughts of suicide. I always put Mr Rogers on to give me some kind of motivation to keep going, but his messages that once resonated so deeply with me began to fade as I slipped further and further away from being ""fine"". I've gotten a lot better over the past few months though, not perfect but still, and when I heard that a movie starring Tom Hanks as Mr Rogers was being made I did all that I could to see it as fast as possible when it finally came out in the UK (which as of writing this, was yesterday).The second this film started, the moment Hanks appeared and the music came on, I just completely melted. I almost audibly broke down into tears, but not with sadness, with joy and relief. I knew I was in for something that would grip me. This film is amazing. It focuses on the psychological healing and betterment of the protagonist, Lloyd, as Mr Rogers taps into his childhood and his feelings, the same way he tapped into the feelings of children back when his show was still on the air and back when I watched it a decade ago, and we get a powerful, touching tribute to this man and the impact he had on so many lives. Lloyd himself was not only well acted, but for me anyway I saw a bit of myself in him. Things like his strained relations with family, his overwhelming and blinding cynicism and his anger management are all things I dealt with at some point and still deal with today. So when the film took this character and and put him on this emotional journey to betterment and healing, it resonated so deeply with me that I began to feel as if I was a kid again, watching Rogers as he taught me how to deal with my own anger and to prioritise kindness, and for many people who saw this film, I feel like they experienced the same thing I did. And that's why this movie is so good. It has the same impact and kind-heartedness as Rogers' original show, but turned into an emotional, thoughtful and touching feature-length film that acts as the perfect tribute to Fred's legacy and life. At the end of the day though, the film, while an amazing tribute to Fred, isn't entirely about him. It's about how he saved the life of Lloyd, became one of his closest friends, and helped him heal his psychological wounds. And the perfect way to put this film is this: It's a film that celebrates the messages, kindness and life of Mr Rogers, that acts as a way to show the impact that he had on so many lives, and despite him not being in the film as much as Lloyd, who is the main protagonist of the film, his impact is felt throughout its entire runtime and in every single scene.Other things as well, the blending of the old Mr Rogers sets with locations in the film was very creative and touching, the acting, especially from Hanks was incredible, the film was perfectly paced and while the score isn't anything to talk about, the parts that do use music are done very well and capture the feel of the scene. The editing might've been a little iffy at points, but that was mainly at the beginning of the film. Overall, it's probably my favourite movie of 2019, even if I did have to wait until 2020 to watch it. If you have not watched it yet, please do. It's absolutely phenomenal.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
179,hooma814,A feel good movie!,7,25 March 2020,"A nice feel good movie if you're wanting something to cheer you up. It was quite moving and emotional at times, as the main character really considers his brokenness. The restoration of the family is the high point and hopefully something we can all attain in families across the world. Easier said than done though. As with the movie sadly it takes until someone is on their death bed before some of these issues are confronted.The perspective of the wife in this movie is missing I think. She has the role of being a family member who isnt the main issue but has to be patient as the father and son figure out their problems. Often a role that is harder than those who have the conflict themselves, as you have to wait for reconciliation to come. This can be a long waiting game and her conversations with Mr Roger's wouldve been an interesting insight that was missed.A nice story, but hard to imagine how this tv show was so popular. It seems so slow paced and low budget. But I guess those days were different. I doubt a show like that these days would not be successful at all. I think people don't really care to be told how to fix their problems, we take offense and try to be independent, isolated. We like the fast paced
nature, of bright colours and fast action. This slow paced story would flop these days I think. How times have changed.Worth a watch.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
180,Benslie,A movie we deserve in this modern age,9,24 November 2019,"First of all, the trailers and posters might have you believe this film is mainly about Mr. Rogers but no it isn't. The movie mainly follows Lloyd and what's going on in his personal life and I really enjoyed it. Do I wish that the advertisements were more accurate to the actual movie topic sure but I understand their decision on why because of money. But honestly it was an interesting story to watch and I enjoyed it. This is also helped by everybody in this movie giving it their all. I'm too young to have watched the actual show growing up but I have seen clips from it and Tom Hanks just does an incredible job as always and I really hope he at least gets an Oscar nomination for best-supporting actor. I mean he pretty much embodied Mr. Rogers and his mannerisms and it makes for an amazing performance. Matthew Rhys does an amazing job as Lloyd. Every time you saw them on screen together it was glorious because you can see how different they are but how they are also helping each other. This movie was well directed, Marielle Heller, and shot. There were so many shots in this movie that I just thought to myself we need more of this in the world. There is one scene that I feel like everybody needs to check out and do at least once in their life. I did enjoy how it was filmed as if it was his show and we were just watching an hour forty-nine-minute long episode. The score by Nate Heller is an excellent one. In the end, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a movie that we need in this day and age and no matter how old you are I think everybody should check out this movie at least once.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

But here I go.People whose opinion I respect - friends, newspaper reviewers - loved this film. Felt that the film's final scene's were sobbing-into-a-hanky worthy. Thought that the Tom Hanks portrayal of Fred Rogers was spot-on. Saw nothing contrived about the story's plotting.I found the reverse. Now I have to say that I am too old by far to have seen - no less appreciate - Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood. And maybe if I'd been fan, or if Il'd watched with my children, I'd feel differently. That said, I found Hanks' portrayal annoying. His voice and mannerisms cloying. The plot contrivances were monumental. Mr. Rogers' angelic showing-up unannounced to help a needy family defying belief (and yes, I know, it's based on a true story, but still, do it in a way that doesn't scream 'fake').I so wanted to leave the theater mid-film.

185,WooderIce64,Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts,8,20 May 2020,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is one of those rare films that manages to be greater than the sum of its parts. While it is known for its depiction of the beloved children's show host Fred Rogers, better known as Mister Rogers, it's not as much about he himself as it is about capturing the spirit of Mr. Rogers. The main character is actually a cynical, jaded journalist named Lloyd Vogel who gets tasked with interviewing Mr. Rogers. While the decision to not have Mr. Rogers as the star may seem odd, it does make sense. Mr. Rogers never made it about him. We love him for his unfaltering devotion to bettering the lives of others, and this film shows that. Mr. Rogers was able to help Lloyd fix his relationships with his wife and father and making him see a better side of himself in the process.While Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance as Mister Rogers, it's hard to see anything other than Tom Hanks. Since we know what Mr. Rogers looked and sounded like, it's easy to contrast it with how Hanks portrays him. However, Hanks gets all due credit for this performance. While he may not look like Mr. Rogers, he captures the essence of Mr. Rogers. He feels like Mr. Rogers. He is very gentle, cares about everyone he meets, and spreads kindness wherever he goes. And as Joanne, his wife, points out, he's not perfect. He's not God. He's no more human than any of us. And yet he manages to make us see the best of ourselves and others.The World of Make-Believe appears throughout the film, as does several hallmarks of the beloved show. The trolley appears, he wears the red cardigan, and sings the theme song. Other characters of this world appear, like Daniel Tiger and King Friday XIII. The movie also uses the signature style of the show to transition from one place to another. For instance, when Lloyd goes to Pittsburgh, we see Pittsburgh looking like it's on the set on Mister Roger's Neighborhood. It's very clever.As mentioned earlier, Beautiful Day is one of those rare movies that manages to be greater than the sum of its parts. This is a most difficult thing to explain. I don't know why, but something about this movie just works. Perhaps it's because the effect that Mr. Rogers had on others extends to us as well. We see ourselves as being broken like Lloyd did (although Mr. Rogers says Lloyd isn't broken) and see Mr. Rogers as our neighborly friend, who makes our lives all the better. It's rare when a movie has that kind of effect, and it's beautiful when it happens.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Seems a bit odd, right? But he's a gazillionaire (he can afford a fleet of shrimp boats, fruit of the sea), so what does he care. He gets to thumb his nose at the hoi polloi and maybe snatch a few more awards. Is there a more overrated actor in Hollyweird? Yes, but barely, his name is James Franco. Hanks' best performances are long behind him, namely Big and Bosom Buddies. Don't even get me going on the Oliver Reed rip off Cast Away with the ball named after his wife. Stupid is as stupid does. Watch reruns of the original Mister Rogers Neighborhood. Feel good about the message and the man. He was the genuine article who touched the lives of millions in a positive way. Forget about Hanks, just forget him. Huge casting error. Twisted message. It's a delusional day in the neighborhood. Hanks and Rogers are not peas and carrots, no siree bob.

187,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Is Quite Neighborly,8,7 January 2020,"The Stream: It's not the Mister Rogers biopic you may be expecting.The Big Screen: A clever and off-beat Tom Hanks performance as Mister Rogers.The Final Bill: Everyone needs a reminder of the limits of humanity and the importance of kindness; and, this movie's heart is in the right place.-Trip FontaineHello, Neighbors! This weekend we had a nice opportunity to see A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, which has been incorrectly deemed the Mister Rogers biopic. There is a healthy dose of Rogers in this movie, but you're not just getting a cradle-to-grave story. Marielle Heller has directed this clever and sometimes off-beat movie with the essence of Mister Rogers sprinkled throughout. In short, the plot synopsis is that a cynical journalist is given an assignment to profile Fred Rogers as an American hero, and the encounter with Rogers affects the journalist in unexpected ways.The film is told like a Mister Rogers' Neighborhood episode. The journalist is the central neighbor, who learns a lesson about forgiveness and anger through his assignment. The framing device allows Heller and her cast to boil down the essence of Fred Rogers and his importance to a generation. Matthew Rhys plays the journalist, who is cynically and emotionally closed off from his family. Tom Hanks plays Fred Rogers as genuine, friendly and like a comforting cardigan sweater. The specifics of what the journalist deals with in his family isn't as important and what he is able to learn from simple conversations from Mister Rogers.Is this your kind of movie? I wasn't particularly running to the theater to see A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, but I am glad I saw it. Either Heller's direction, which includes fun and sometimes disorienting sequences involving Mister Rogers' characters, or maybe it's just a calm and smiling Hanks as Mister Rogers, that lulled me into easy affection for this movie. The production design of the set and the vignettes from scene-to-scene add some whimsy that was a nice departure to some the more serious and adult themes.Ultimately, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a nice movie with a good moral for all. Like many Mister Rogers' Neighborhood episode, the viewer is edified and comforted into believing that humanity and emotions are manageable. That makes the film itself worthwhile for at least a matinee bowl of popcorn.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
188,helenbassett,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Film Review - Marielle Heller Directs A Charming Tom Hanks Playing Puppets With Matthew Rhys - We All Need A Little Mr Rogers,10,8 February 2020,"In the UK we generally wouldn't know Mr Rogers and his children's tv programme, but Marielle Heller has directed the Best Supporting Oscar Nominee Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood, a whimsical film about the eponymous tv presenter. Her previous film Can You Ever Forgive Me? also saw Melissa McCarthy achieve a Best Actress Oscar nomination last year. Pretty impressive in her short list of Director gigs.When I first saw the trailer for the film I expected the worst, an expose of a beloved children's hero, tarnished with tell all gossip. But instead while watching the film I reassessed my cynicism and anger of the last few years, as much as Matthew Rhys's character Lloyd Vogel does. And I came away humming the theme tune like I had known it my whole life. A little of Mr Rogers magical philosophy had rubbed off on me.I loved how the tv sets and models merged into real life, with Mr Rogers introducing his new friend Lloyd, who is looking a little worse for wear on the picture board. Lloyd's relationship with his father played by Chris Cooper having been strained for many years. But there is humour in Lloyd's life, starting with his sister's third marriage. He'll just use the previous speeches and insert the appropriate name.But the prizewinning journalist is surprised next day when his Esquire editor wants him to write a 400 word article on Fred Rogers for their Hero issue. To be honest the only 'Hero' in the article who will be interviewed by Lloyd! And is inspired by the actual 4000 word article written by Esquire writer Tom Junod. But now as then, Lloyd considers it beneath his hard hitting journalism, although Christine Lahti's Ellen will not take no for an answer. And Susan Kelechi Watson as wife Andreas begs him not to ruin her childhood.And meeting Mr Rogers on the Pittsburgh set he seems too good to be true. Loved by everyone and fiercely guarded by his tv staff. Just like Tom Hanks himself I guess. But you can see why Lloyd might make a character assassin of the genial guy in cardigan and sneakers. But instead of interviewing Fred Rogers, it's Lloyd that finds himself on the couch. How his father leaving at an early age informed his own thoughts of parenthood, and how his mother's death affected him and his sister. All without even realising he has been analysed.And the more times that Lloyd interviews Fred, or to be honest the other way round, the more that Fred's goodness and kindness is filling Lloyd's cynical shell. Allowing his rage to be replaced with peace, and sharing a minute's silence together is deeply spiritual, for everyone in the restaurant, and audience too I guess. The children singing to Mr Rogers in the subway carriage was a joyous moment in a colourful life, as Lloyd looks on in wonder. The man on screen is the man he meets, there is no acting. And Mr Rogers might be just the nicest person Lloyd has ever met.As I had no preconceived view of Mr Rogers, the film perfectly presented a man completely at ease with his own being, and allowed Lloyd's broken character to be the star of his own episode in a surreal dream. A hint of Mr Rogers darkness did occur with the ending crescendo of the piano, and I understand a recent documentary may have gone further. But here Marielle Heller uses Fred Rogers and his tv programme that looked at adult themes from a child's perspective, as the catalyst to change Lloyd's outlook on life. And I can assume there was plenty of sadness when Fred Rogers died in 2003, and perhaps as it says, we could all use a little of the Mr Rogers style of kindness now. Although we're not particularly religious in the UK it was a thoughtful film with note perfect cast and directing.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I was expecting a biopic with Tom Hanks doing a passable job of imitating Mr. Rogers, but nothing extraordinary. What it actually is it is a touching point of view of who Fred Rogers was: Just a kind person treating people the way he would like to be treated.
It's nice to see a movie that you pretty much predict how it is going to go and it turns out to be completely different and much better because of it.
Tom Hanks didn't do an over the top impression of Mr. Rogers, he was still very much Tom Hanks but conveying who Mr. Rogers was. I though all the cast played their roles with a true feeling of people actually meeting Mr. Rogers with preconceived ideas of who he is onstage vs offstage.
I grew up in the Mr. Rogers era and I watched it every now and then as a kid, but no way was I a fan of the show, but as I read more about who Fred Rogers was in my adult years, he truly is someone needs to be admired, respected and loved.

I guess you need that history to get it.That said, Tom Hanks does what he does best, creates a perfect image of he who he is portraying. The problem is that this isn't a movie about Mr Roger's, it's about the Esquire 'interview' and the reporter who produced it. That doesn't help if you a) have no idea just how important Mr Roger's was in so many young peoples lives, and b) you had no idea that a reporter had a change of life because of interactions with Mr Roger's (or don't care), I guess that reinforces the statements that many people have made about how Mr Roger's influenced their upbringing.So, with no 'background' I watched this movie because it had received so many sterling reviews, that however, successfully marred the entire experience for me because it was plain and simply boring and doesn't live up to the reviews!Synopsis: If you remember Mr Roger's from your childhood you'll probably like this movie, if you didn't, I would recommend giving it a miss unless you like melodrama's based around dysfunctional families.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

To be clear, Mr. Rogers was more than different colored cardigans, sneakers, and puppets. He taught children about important things like feelings, accepting themselves for who they are, divorce and death. Tom Hanks is flawless as Mr. Rogers. He has the voice and mannerisms down pat! In this movie, Mr. Rogers taught Lloyd to forgive his neglectful father before the man died. The always great Chris Cooper was the father.
I do wish they had the fish tank and I looked for it. I also am curious if the miniature artist who worked on ""Hereditary"" provided his or her services to this movie for the miniatures? In a way, his movie has something in common with ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" with Elizabeth Mongomery as Lizzie. She and Lizzie were distant cousins and Tom Hanks and Fred Rogers were 6th cousins.
I think Fred Rogers is watching Tom Hanks with approval from paradise because Tom's performance was that good!",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

202,severindringel,Tom Hanks shines in an otherwise predictable film,7,2 December 2020,"Director Marielle Heller could not have cast the role of the legendary Fred Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood any better. Tom Hanks is not only known for being a brilliant actor, but is also considered one of the most likeable celebrities in Hollywood. This is also evident in this 109-minute film.Hanks' performance as the children's icon Mr. Rogers is heartwarming and can hardly be surpassed in its realism with the real person. If Fred Rogers, who died in 2003, is not known to anyone, you should definitely watch videos showing him before watching the film. Even if the optical similarity is not given, Hanks otherwise hits the nail on the head. His way of talking, facial expressions, gestures and above all this passionate interest in his fellow human beings is very similar to the real person.But the film is not a pure biopic . The main character is the journalist Lloyd Vogel, played by Matthew Rhys. He embodies the reporter who had the same experience with Mr Rogers in real life. A moody workaholic at first, he builds up a very strange but life-changing friendship with Mr. Rogers over the course of the film, which turns his views and behaviour completely upside down. Rhys plays the journalist well, but his storyline lacks that final depth that would have been needed in a film like this. Since this plot determines the majority of the film, Rogers is in the end only a supporting character with an enormous presence, he becomes a bit long-winded over long stretches.The film is aimed at Mr. Rogers' personality, which explains the slow pace. Nevertheless the story of the main character seems like something we have seen many times before. Even though it affects you in a way, especially towards the end, there is a certain distance throughout the film. Unless, of course, Mr. Rogers, who seems unrealistically friendly to many, comes into play. Hanks manages to capture every scene with enormous empathy. The fact that Fred Rogers was really like that makes A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood a good illustration of a person who helped people find positivity in life.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

204,Abranth-d,Mr Rogers will live on in our memories.,6,18 January 2020,"Here's my review of ' A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood ' . So ""ABDITN"" stars Tom Hanks as Mr Rogers . For those of you who don't know , Mr Rogers was a television host who ran a popular kids show in the 80s where he spoke about the troubles that children would and were going through and solutions for them . Now I went for this movie after watching a documentary last year about Mr Rogers and his show , what I learnt from that was how Fred Rogers was just a nice guy in general without any baggage and people found it odd . Now this movie is about an investigative reporter with Daddy issues working on an article about Mr Rogers himself , since he's an investigative reporter he doubts how someone like Rogers can be so nice without a single loose end or blackmark , I liked the scenes where he would ask direct qns to Mr Rogers and Rogers would shy away , but I was really more interested to see an attempt at unmasking or dive deep into the psyche of Mr Rogers but instead the movie made Mr Rogers like a therapist to the interviewer helping him settle out Daddy issues and gave him more screen time than Rogers . I also saw a lot of positive articles online and that made me understand that nostalgia plays a huge role in a movie like this and it's one of the reasons why it didn't relate with me in a much deeper level. However I did feel the warmth from Hank's portrayal of Mr Rogers despite being in an air conditioned theatre. In the end the movie who's name is too long to type was warm , had great acting , simple dialogue and a gentle reminder to be nice to people.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

On January 29th, it was announced that TriStar Pictures had bought the worldwide distribution rights for the source material that would eventually become 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.'

Based on the true story of a real-life friendship between Fred Rogers and journalist Tom Junod. It's a thoughtful,textured contemplation of how we can effectively deal with our expectations, disappointments and imperfections. The film brings back many aspects of nostalgia for viewers of the original show .Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers is every bit as perfect as anyone would have guessed. He finds a way to capture the essence of Mr. Rogers, the beacon of positivity he became. The teacher. The friend. The nicest man in the world. I stopped seeing Mr. Hanks and started seeing Mr. Rogers, which is what an iconic actor will do when given the chance.

The movie is beautifully shot; the cinematography is top notch. Beautifully written and wonderfully directed. The screenplay is absolute genius.Tom Hanks' beautiful and compassionate portrayal of Fred Rogers, Mathew Rhys and the entire cast delivering remarkable performances, a beautifully structured screenplay , and Marielle Heller's nostalgic and sincere directing style culminate together and craft A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood as being the most most healing film of the year. 8/10",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Chris Cooper brings off one more disagreeable character, and he makes it quite different from any of the same characters you've seen him do before. Susan Kelechi-Watson - as the long-suffering, patient wife makes more out of the role than the script seems to give her. And Christine Lahti gives Ellen - the ""shut-up-and-get-it-done"" magazine editor - a subtle humanity that was barely expected and beautifully woven in.

The other characters seemed average, you feel little emotion for so it's more like watching from the outside without the connection. The pacing is kinda slow which doesn't help this either.

Maybe I should have seen the documentary first, or maybe too much holiday merrymaking didn't put me in the right mental space to enjoy a saccharine sweet morality tale with an aw-shucks Tom Hanks donning the famed sweater and sneakers with such a lack of verve that I nodded off a few times.

214,mauriciofernandogerhardt,the story:,10,15 January 2020,"Presentation:
the movie is presented as if it was one of Mr. Roger's episodes.
the story:
In the past a man and a woman had 2 children. The woman gets very sick. The man leaves her and cheats on her. The woman dies agonizing. The boy gets angry and grows up to become a an exposé journalist. On his sister wedding, the journalist fights with his cheater father. The father wants to talk to him, but he doesn't want to listen and avoids him.
The journalist always writes about the bad parts of people. So his magazine boss is having a hard time getting people to have an interview with him, so she sends him to do some easy positive job about Mr. Rogers so he would get rebranded as someone who also does positive lights on people. He doesn't like the assignment, and he's going to look for dirt on Mr. Rogers.
He flies over to see Mr. Rogers and sees him in a make-a-wish situation wherein a dying child is talking to Mr. Rogers, until the child decides to hug Mr. Rogers. This makes the production of his tv show half an hour late. The journalist asks around and apparently he does make-a-wish things everyday.
The movie goes back and forth between the journalist's personal life, and him investigating Mr. Rogers, and interviewing him.
He sees Mr. Rogers trying to open a tent and failing, but instead of cutting it out of the program, he leaves it in, to show kids that even adults fail on their planning. He learns that Mr. Rogers also does every puppet in the show. Apparently he really is a very good person, but Mr. Rogers' wife admits that he shouldn't be seen as a saint, because that would make people think that they wouldn't be able to follow his example. The journalist digs deeper and starts to question him about Mr. Rogers' children, and anger. Mr. Rogers admits it was hard raising them, and that he feels anger sometimes, but he chooses to direct his anger in some way that doesn't hurt anyone, like playing piano keys with strength.
In his personal life, the journalist has a verbal argument with his father, which ends up putting the father in hospital. But influenced by Mr. Rogers' talks, he becomes more open about his feelings and learns to forgive his father.
The jounalist writes a long article about Mr. Rogers which gets published. Everyone likes it. Mr. Rogers and the journalist remain friends after the publication. The jounalist's family life are resolved.
Final scene: Mr. Rogers is playing a piano song alone and suddenly he stops and plays the keys very strongly (to remind the audience that he has is angry, that he has a temper, that he is not perfect, that we can follow his exemple to be better people).
Extra scene: As the credits roll up, shows many people working on the set of Mr. Rogers' show (as a reminder that even though there was one main star in the show, it wouldn't have been the same without the work of all these other people. This serves as an analogy to the production of the movie: Even though Tom Hanks is the main star, the movie wouldn't have been the same without the work of all the other people who've worked on it).",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

If you compare this movie to other movies that are based on a true story and talking about the life of a person then this movie would be the worst out of all of them.The directing was alright and maybe that's what made the movie alright too.

However, what brings it down is that it should have focused more on Mr. Rogers than the journalist, who is the lead character in the movie. He is a boring, uninteresting character and I did not care about him at all. I really like the show The Americans and the journalist character is played by Matthew Rhys who is wonderful in that show but his character is just not written that well and is not compelling enough to keep my interest all the way through the movie.

220,actaction,"More Rogers, Less Gimmicks",6,26 November 2019,"6 outta 10 - Just okay, maybe see.I disagree with critics and majority of people that this was a great film. Feels more like a PBS acid trip, than a careful exploration of what it means to be a real hero. Tom Hanks is great, but is barely in the film, much like Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs we eagerly await his every witty quip or anecdote & wish for his next scene only to realize he is more a plot device than a flesh and blood character. Yet, the film keeps telling you he is not perfect, keeps hinting there is more to know, but coldly stops and gets lost in a much much less interesting story of someone whom he helps. Replace Mr Rogers with any wise-figure (Santa Claus for example) and little would change... very small efforts are made to give Mr Rogers enough time to develop himself more than what we can figure out from watching him on tv. We're supposed to just accept he really was a nice guy (which I don't doubt) and never supposed to ask for a full backstory. The film even muses how the article being written (and by association, the film which is based on it) isn't even about Mr Rogers... as if they delight you've been fooled. I'd be fine with this if any other character was remotely believable (and it's based on a true story... so you know they are real). Instead this $50M film feels super cheaply made (except for A List Tom Hanks). Every character says exactly what they mean every second of the time, having zero depth or nuance and are painted in broad strokes, despite the Mr Rogers character being one of the most intriguing real people ever on television. Eventually the plot just gives up and gets stuck in the gimmick of this being just another episode of Mr Rogers, having Hanks talk to the camera as the real guy did. It's cute at first, but once you realize the entire film will keep going back to this, doesn't have the staying power or the lack of distraction as Forrest Gump's storytelling narrator had. Hanks tries, but the whole niche feels clichè and hackneyed. There are some genuine good moments in the film... a death bed scene, a couple of good moments with Rogers (most of which are in the trailer). I still think it's best to skip this and watch the hit documentary Won't you Be My Neighbor, made last year on a micro budget. It had me in tears. This one, had me looking at my watch as the two hour Rogers episode kept up the gimmick. Sorry, didn't like it.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Hold behold, you grow up and do the exact same things that you found offensive and did not want to do in the first place. You turn out to be the same person you despise.People around you realise that, but not you. You become angry when you are reminded of the fact. You carry the anger throughout your life, burning yourself in the inside.When you realise your shortcoming, life becomes beautiful, it seems, according to the encounter between Mr Rogers (Fred Rogers of 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood' fame) and an Esquire journalist, Lloyd Vogel.The said interview took place in 1998 with Tom Junod and his Esquire article became the basis of the movie. The screenwriters took the liberty to spice up the story and hence renamed the reporter.At the time of the interview, Mr Rogers was already a household name. American children grew with him in the living room, telling them about the difficult facts of life like war, death, race, being handicapped and bullying. He was the then Oprah of the day for children and had all their difficult questions answered.Vogel, a cynical man, is bogged down with his own issues. Growing up without a father who left him and his sister when their mother fell ill, he has an axe to grind when the father returns with his wife that he left his mother for. The journalist, a young father, cannot connect with his wife and his young daughter.Vogel cannot believe a person as perfect as depicted in the TV show can exist in real life. His series built a strong friendship that lasted a lifetime.In 2018, there was a documentary out showcasing the work done by Fred Rogers in WQED studios and later PBS to stimulate pre-school children awareness. Ordained as a Presbyterian minister, he found satisfaction working with child psychologists and emphasising long lost qualities like patience, reflection and 'silence in a noisy world'. Despite being a man of the Church, he found it more appropriate like impart the teachings of Book not by overt external representations, like donning the collar or mentioning God's fame. He preached via actions, listening and music. He is an accomplished pianist and a lifelong swimmer.Towards the end of life, he became progressively depressed, conflicted and angry. Perhaps he felt that his life's work had come to zilch after the 911 incident, the increasing hatred and inclusiveness among people. He was also accused of promoting the 'entitled' generation as his mantra is to make every child feel special. His inclusiveness of treating everyone alike earned him the label of promoting deviant sexual orientation as his co-star turned out to be gay.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

But the more Tom Hanks' Mr Rogers spoke, the more depth this movie proved to have. It spoke to children and the child in all of us. But it's not a kids movie per se. Some lessons can take a lifetime to learn and this film was a reminder of the good that can come from simply being kind and decent. It didn't feel preachy - more like chicken soup for the soul. I wondered if over time this movie would one day be held in the same regard as that old time Hollywood classic, 'it's a wonderful life'. Both Jimmy Stewart and Tom Hanks have that kind of feel-good aura about them as people and not just actors. And to my mind, both films deal with the importance of unqualified love, family and community. I know die hard cynics will find fault with it, but I think it's a beautifully crafted movie and just what we need in this day and age of social media shouting and physical isolation.

Outside the US, we really hadn't a clue who this guy was. Inside the US, many had high expectations: some were elated, others found it creepy. Hanks is a professional, the other actors reliable and competent. But the preternatural need for Americans to find ""closure"" is the predominant leitmotif of the screenplay, the urge for resolve between children and their parents, husbands and wives. Among modern analysts of US psychopathy, this is called the ""Disney syndrome"".

He helped millions of children in many ways. Not just educationally but taught values without preaching. Without ""spoiling"" I will say that he helped one person in his time of need. When my children were little. I watched the show sometimes when I was home during the day. Along with ""Sesame Street"" PBS provided a great forum for children. Growing up in Pittsburgh, um, ah, ""a few years ago,"" I watched the Josie Carey Show where Fred got his start. Mr Rogers along with Julia Child, and Masterpiece Theater, helped build PBS into a unique network. I salute him for that. Great performances by the entire cast. Special shout-out to Matthew Rhys. My only criticism - some very slow-moving parts. But overall worth seeing.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
232,michaeldoud,First Hit: I was deeply touched by this film about how kindness and forgiveness can move internal mountains.,9,25 November 2019,"First Hit: I was deeply touched by this film about how kindness and forgiveness can move internal mountains.Unlike the recent documentary about Fred Rogers, which gives an insight to the man, this film opens the door on this enigmatic kind soul named Fred Rogers by watching him work with an adult.The opening scenes with Rogers (Tom Hanks) talking to the camera as he enters the famed neighborhood set, sitting down, taking off his shoes and putting on tennis shoes and a sweater was precious. While watching this scene, I was transported back in time, sitting in the living room with my young daughter watching Mr. Rogers open the door to children's hearts and minds.In this story, Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), is an investigative reporter who has a reputation of taking cheap shots at people or discovers the darker sides of individuals and writes stories that do not reflect positively on his subjects. He's not the reporter you want to have to write your story.Getting an assignment to write a short four-hundred-word piece about Rogers for Esquires Magazine's hero edition, Lloyd chastises his boss for assigning him to write a fluff piece. When Vogel gets home and tells his wife Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson) about this horrible assignment, she bemoans, ""don't ruin my childhood."" This is the perfect setup.As Lloyd and Fred meet for an interview, Vogel is perplexed by the way Rogers approaches the question, sometimes answering it directly, and other times deflects or answers a different question - the one not asked. Slowly, Roger's magic of compassion and kindness begins to work on Vogel in underlying ways. He begins to question his anger and the way he's participating in his relationship with his wife and new baby.During the interviews, Vogel, at times, gets upset at not getting the answers he is looking for and walks away from Rogers. However, once he steps away, he knows there is something there and goes back. Each time he learns more about himself as well as Fred.It's through these sporadic interviews, Vogel begins to learn how he needs to change his life by processing his inner anger towards his father, Jerry (Chris Cooper). As the story unfolds, Lloyd hasn't seen his father since he was a little kid. His mother also died while he was young, and his father couldn't deal with it, so he bailed.The film is a beautiful orchestration of how Fred Rogers operates in the world, how people see him, his version of kindness, and how he reaches out and touches people, young and old with honest and real sincerity.I loved how the filmmakers interspersed Mr. Rogers's sets, set pieces, and traveling between Pittsburgh and NYC. It was ingenious, to say the least.Hanks was sublime as Rogers. The ability to make the audience sense and feel the embodiment of Fred Rogers was terrific. Rhys was clearly perfect as the reporter who had the willingness to travel through his anger, sadness, and sorrow to come to grips with how he was going to be in the future. Watson was terrific as Lloyd's wife. Her compassion for Lloyd's struggles was wonderfully portrayed. Cooper was powerful as Lloyd's father, a man who did wrong and was trying the only way he knew to find forgiveness and peace within himself. Maryann Plunkett, as Fred's wife Joanne was excellent. Her understanding of Fred and how he worked was divine. Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster wrote a fantastic script. Marielle Heller was deft in creating a film that captured this iconic man.Overall: This story took me on a trip and brought up genuine, deeply felt feelings and emotions.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

234,mickman91-1,For Americans who know Fred Rogers,6,12 November 2021,I think you have to be American and have a knowledge and understanding and attachment to Fred Rogers to get this film. I could see what it was trying to do and it was very pleasant. But it felt more like a tribute than a film for outsiders to enjoy.,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
235,nehpetstephen,"Good, but it completely misses the point",7,17 January 2020,"There's a moment in Tom Junod's ""Can You Say...Hero?"", the source material for this movie, where Mr. Rogers meets with a 14-year-old boy with severe cerebral palsy. He's a nervous boy, full of rage and depression, convinced that he's so worthless and helpless that it would be better if he were to simply die. When his hero travels across the country to meet him, Mr. Rogers asks, ""I would like you to do something for me. Would you do something for me?"" The boy consents, and Mr. Rogers asks him to pray for him. Junod writes, in an article that's readily available online and that you should definitely take 20 minutes to read, ""The boy was thunderstruck because nobody had ever asked him for something like that, ever. The boy had always been prayed for. The boy had always been the object of prayer, and now he was being asked to pray for Mister Rogers.""In Junod's view, Rogers flipped the script. American culture by-and-large teaches that disabled people are pitiful, in need of support and praise, always the recipients and never the givers of assistance. Yet Rogers, through his faith, bestowed dignity on the boy by empowering him, by showing him that even he could do something to help even a man as powerful and important as Mr. Rogers. Or so Junod thinks, still persisting in the same dichotomy--that Mr. Rogers is strong and the boy is weak and Mr. Rogers is kind insofar as he makes a pretend show of generously making the kid feel important. Once there alone, Junod says as much to Mr. Rogers, yet he's met ""at first with puzzlement and then with surprise. 'Oh, heavens no, Tom! I didn't ask him for his prayers for him; I asked for me. I asked him because I think that anyone who has gone through challenges like that must be very close to God. I asked him because I wanted his intercession.'"" Mr. Rogers truly sensed it--that the boy was in a superior place to him. Mr. Rogers empowered the boy not as a magnanimous ploy, but out of a sincere, faith-driven belief in the boy's strength.Now consider how this scene is rendered in A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD: Lloyd Vogel's (aka fake Tom Junod's) elderly father, Jerry (Chris Cooper), is in his deathbed, clearly on death's door step. He will never be seen alive in the film again. Mr. Rogers (Tom Hanks) whispers in his ear, and Jerry agrees. On the sidewalk, Lloyd (Matthew Rhys) asks what just went down. Mr. Rogers grins. ""I asked him to pray for me. I figure a man who's been through all that he's been through must be pretty close to God."" End of story.Do you see how these two similar stories have *completely different* effects? In one (the real story), Mr. Rogers uses his faith, his heartfelt conviction, and his empathic way of seeing the world to vastly improve a person's sense of self. And in the fictional version? A superstitious man asks someone to put in a good word for him in Heaven. ""Hey! You'll be there soon. Would you mind saying some nice things about me?""There's so much that's good about this film. Tom Hanks--although he really looks nothing like Fred Rogers--captures the man's quiet captivation in a very striking and charming way. Chris Cooper's performance is also very lived in and convincing. The film nicely recreates the look, tone, and feel of the original show, and overall the film is moving and charismatic.And yet... it's not the real story. It doesn't really convey the truth of Mr. Rogers. Rogers was a religious man. I'm not (I'm agnostic), yet it seems like the suppression of such in this film is a disservice. Rogers's faith helped to center him. As his wife says in the film, he wasn't a perfect saint; he was a man who, according to an article Junod recently wrote in The Atlantic in response to the film, worked very hard in order to maintain his compassion and ministry. He had a file full of notes on his friends so that he could remember how to be of service to them. This is the kind of stuff that seems essential to include in a film like this--the actual hard work of being a thoughtful, compassionate person. The screenplay gestures at it, but fails to really explore its resonance, instead opting for a cheap redemption story.It's fine that they took liberties with Junod's life story, but why did they bother? The story they invent--about father-son estrangement--is so extremely conventional and tired. Why focus on that now? The movie was sold as speaking to our particularly horrifying times, yet the fictional story at its core is the same small potatoes melodrama that would have been the centerpiece of an indie film from fifteen years ago.There are so many thing about this film that simply don't work, that misfire, that seem shallow and magical--things that seem perfectly whimsical on screen but in no way translatable to real life. Take for instance the scene in the diner in which Rogers urges Lloyd to spend a whole minute in silence contemplating the people who loved him into existence. This is a moment that hearkens back to Rogers's actual children's show--which lingered in long, silent stretches of peaceful contemplation and which featured one scene in which Rogers literally set an egg timer for a full minute and then just let the camera roll, motionless, trained on him as he quietly waited, for 60 seconds (sooooooo long in cinematic time). This moment also recalls the end of the 2018 Mr. Rogers documentary, Won't You Be My Neighbor?, where a similar question is followed by silence as the camera trains itself on each of the doc's interview subjects.The original moment from Mr. Rogers's show works. It's true silence. True prolonged contemplation. There's nothing to do but sit there and collect your thoughts. To dwell on the zen moment. To place yourself in your body as someone who exists in time and space and who is experiencing this moment with another man. Only actual motionless silence can accomplish this. The Austrian director Michael Haneke achieves this to wonderful effect in his films; it is the entire philosophy of his filmmaking. Chantel Akerman did it to riveting effect in Jeanne Dielman, and Bela Tarr also gets a lot of mileage out of it. True still, silent contemplation is rare in film and television. Mr. Rogers was extremely bold in doing something like that.The documentary didn't quite achieve the same effect. The movie poises the question to the viewers, but then the movie cycles through numerous faces, each of them silently contemplating the question. Are we supposed to be thinking about the question ourselves? Or are we supposed to be observing the people on screen who are thinking about this question? Personally, I was unable to think about the question for myself because I was more interested in observing the thoughtful faces of these people who knew and loved the man at the movie's center.The documentary's deployment of this moment fell short, but this movie's use of the moment is a total misfire. Yes, the audio track goes silent for a minute (I didn't time it, but I'd bet it isn't even an actual full minute), but the filmmaking is anything but silent. The filmmaking in this moment is in fact the equivalent of blazing horns and exploding fireworks. There's rapid cutting. Background characters who aren't even privy to the conversation suddenly, surreally turn to look towards the action of the scene in a very ostentatious way. And then Mr. Rogers does the loudest thing of all--he breaks the fourth wall and stares directly at us for 20ish seconds. The film is trying to say, let's be quiet and think about the people who love us for a minute, but how can a viewer actually do that when the film is being so over-the-top weird and Tom Hanks is literally staring you down in Mr. Rogers makeup? It's weird. It's not contemplative; it is the opposite of so.And yet I gave this movie a 7/10, which in my book is a pretty good score. It made me cry. If I were in the Academy, I would've gladly nominated Tom Hanks. I would recommend it to other people. Compared to the source material, however, it is a disaster. I'd have rather seen the true story of Old Rabbit presented--a story that's just about how sometimes praying can be comforting--than whatever this movie is trying to be. Forgive your father, sure. America in 2019 requires something more, though.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

What a really nice, kind, generous and good person Mister Rogers was! I watched him when I was a little girl in the 70's and always looked forward to watching his show. I really recommend this movie if you ever watched and enjoyed Mister Rogers as a kid! It was great to see the kind man he was in the show, he portrayed in real life as well!

239,OlgaGorelik,Could have used more human in this human saint,6,27 December 2019,"I didn't grow up in the US. I haven't seen a single episode of Mr Rogers show. Not a problem. The movie did a pretty good job showing even someone without sentimental attachment why the program would be so beloved. And I really liked the way scenes morphed from the show into real life. But I found the attempt to portray Fred Rogers himself as someone who is just as good of a person, if not better, in real life, yet still a real human being rather unconvincing. He still came across as saintly and rather one dimensional. They kept telling us how he's carrying so much weight on his shoulders, how he struggled with his own kids, how he has a temper, but never really showed any of that, except just a tiny bit in the very end. Every once in a while Tom Hanks would give him a look in his eyes that struck me as creepy, but there was never any payoff. It felt good to see him help Lloyd (Mathew Rhys) through, but at times his actions bordered on stalking. Speaking of Lloyd, his transformation seemed a little too fast and improbably smooth. Part of it was also confusing. I saw that he was having huge problem with his father, but I didn't notice any trouble with his wife and son. He didn't take any time off? What man did in those days? I wonder if there were scenes that got cut.Overall, it's a well made film, a pleasant watch. The last scene was brilliant. I can sort see why it was saved for last, yet I think I would have liked the movie more if it weren't the only one like that.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
240,schnoidl,wonderful movie obscured by stupid casting of Tom Hanks,6,3 January 2020,"When Hollywood cast Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman, I was pissed. No way was I going to forget and get lost in the character. Wrong. By the end of the movie, it *was* Andy Kaufmann up there, plain as day. Not long after Tom Hanks opened his mouth in this movie, I knew that was really not going to be happening. I heard there's a really great documentary on the man, which I will be seeking out. This fell short, for that one reason.I never appreciated Mr. Rogers as a kid; I thought he was a tool, really lame. Years later, once I escaped puberty and developed empathy, I realized his value. All around Hanks is a lovely charming movie, but he's just a placeholder in the middle of it all, taking up space, never being more than Tom Hanks playing a role. It's like eating a really nice meal, but you have to chew around a small stone the whole time. He keeps his laugh lines jacked, and talks gently, and that's it. Could have gotten lost in the role and made something memorable. Nope.Did anyone, anywhere think, ""no I don't think I'll go see it, oh wait Tom Hanks is the lead, sure let's!""?

I think this is a movie made for the audience in the USA and people who don't know Fred Rogers (Like most Non-Americans) will view this movie with completely different eyes.You go into that movie thinking, that you gonna see Tom Hanks as the lead character, but thats not at all the case. At best, he is a supporting character for the lead of Lloyd Vogel, but I'd make a statement, that Fred is actually only a plot device in this movie. Don't get me wrong, Hanks is amazing in this role. Creepy, weird but so kind at the same time. It's hard not to laugh about his sincere kindness, but it will warm your heart for sure! We are not used to people being so kind these days, so it's pretty off putting.While Hanks and Rhys deliver great performances, this movie suffers from the (unfortunately still very common) problem, of creating weak female characters. Lloyds wife is beyond annoying and every other female character is as plain as a Dorito, you left in the bathtub for hours.While the ""outdoor/Ext. Shots"" are handled in a pretty interesting and artsy way, the rest of the movie lacks memorable cinematography. The end is as predictable as it gets, which is not a bad thing for this movie though, as it's the perfect fit for Hanks character, Mr. Rodgers.What this movie is best at is reminding you, that it's not hard to be kind and maybe we all should be more kind to each other, because kindness is the only thing you can't have enough of in this world nowadays!",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

243,thetyvonlesure,An Emotional Day in the Cinema,8,10 December 2019,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a film based on children's television icon, Mister Rogers, and his impact on a writer from Esquire Magazine. The film stars Tom Hanks as Mister Rogers and Matthew Rhys as Lloyd Vogel. The story is inspired by an Esquire Magazine article titled ""Can You Say...Hero?"" by Tom Junod (the real-life counterpart of Lloyd Vogel.The story of the film is relatively un-relatable, because it is oriented toward real-life events of writer, Tom Junod. The conflict is very specified and mirrors that of an anomaly. Despite being the protagonist, the general audience can not relate to Lloyd Vogel, because he is a popular press journalist with family conflict relatable only to his circumstances. Lloyd spends a majority of the film holding resentment toward his family and Mister Rogers, because of a grudge he has with his father. He's a miserable character. Mister Roger's role is to help Lloyd in his conflict. Ultimately, Mister Rogers takes a backseat to an un-relatable tale of a miserable journalist. The story drags when Mister Rogers isn't a focal point. The story inherits emotion from its nostalgic subject matter. Despite a generic story, the film is emotionally driven by Mister Rogers and the theme of death.The acting is great. Tom Hanks wins over detractors in his portrayal of Mister Rogers. Hanks assumes the role of Mister Rogers, which would undoubtedly make the real Fred Rogers proud. The depiction of Mister Roger's kindness and faith is well done. Director Marielle Heller does a phenomenal job in recreating the essence of Mister Rogers. Tom Hank's soft spoken voice and well tempered body language presents much needed levity. Matthew Rhys does a fantastic job as Lloyd. He conveys a large range of emotion from facials alone. The supporting cast do a great job of being supporting characters. They fill in any emotional gaps that the film yearns.The cinematography is well done. The film is well lit. The writing of the film is bland, and at times corny. Marielle Heller's direction is great, as despite a weak story and plot, she wins audiences over with her use of emotion and her recreation of Mister Rogers. The film is very stylized, as it blurs between Mister Roger's toy neighborhood set and reality.Overall, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a good film that overcomes a weak story with superb execution. Fred Rogers would be proud.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

His childhood, his being bullied, his college years, becoming a minister, going into television, his personal life. Instead, the film is about an angry fictitious journalist who must write a piece on Fred Rogers. The movie was slow, and weird. I saw more than one person sleeping in the theatre.

247,oneofthesilence,Very pleasant and powerful,9,27 June 2020,"This was just a super wholesome movie full of funny, though provoking, and funny moments. The performances were great all around. Most notably Tom Hanks and Fred Rogers. He plays him perfectly and he's probably the best part about the movie. I also found the main character, Lloyd Vogel, to be quite compelling. The plot reminded me a lot of the 2017 film ""The Case For Christ"". Both films follow a journalist who takes a deep dive into one of the greatest people to ever live while also struggling with an estranged and dying father and slight marital problems. And through the experiences they have surrounding this great person, their perspective changes and their life is improved for the better. Both films do this really well. Another great thing about this movie is the visuals. A lot of pretty striking cinematography with great use of reflections and tracking shots. And they also used some of Mr. Rogers old little town sets for transitional sequences. It's very creative. My only big issue with this movie is that dream sequence. It's way to long, confusing, ridiculous, and I could barely tell when it started and stopped. It also just feels like a lazy way to further develop Lloyd. And also on the note of Lloyd. A minor issue I have is the fact that he's a little to much of a jerk for a little too long. But his eventual turn around is still convincing. His conflict with his dad, Jerry, is also very much interesting and comes to satisfying conclusion. So overall, while this movie isn't perfect, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and kinda loved it.

One could argue that there is no evidence of any success and that maybe so but teaching and being good cannot be wrong. This is a redemption film and an awakening and maybe to America and the rest of the world a realisation that sometimes we only fully appreciate something that is truly good once it has gone.It is not a perfect film and for me there is one odd scene in the film which did not really fit in, a kind of dream sequence but other than that it is lovingly crafted.

Lloyd has demons of the past through family history with the death of his mother and behavior of Father Jerry (Chris Cooper). Given an assignment ""fluff"" piece for his job on Esquire he is meeting with childhood hero Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks). Fred a man of life experience explains how he deals with dark issues as he sees it through their eyes. This leads to Lloyd questioning his own life as a father and son.All acting is exceptional in this film with a mention to Chris Cooper.

Tom Hanks too is a lovely person that has proven time and time again he is just a great actor when it comes to playing real people.
A beautiful day in the neighborhood is a touching story about a journalist with his new born child and wife coming in terms with his past childhood trauma through the help given to him by Mr Rogers when he is tasked with writing a puff piece about the heroes of our age (film is set in 1998).
What really gets you in this movie in my opinion is how good Tom Hanks is depicting Mr Rogers.
His calm and soothing manner of speech and aura.
There is also the music of the show being performed through out the movie which is done beautifully.
Tom Hanks SINGS! I don't think I have ever seen him do that, that was sweet.

This film felt therapeutic to me, the person that Rhys plays Lloyd Vogel was a character that I resonated with in too many ways. The film to me does an excellent job at showcasing depression and how it can impact relationships, your reputation and the ways we handle it also showcasing how important it is to have someone to talk to when these times are tough and how much that can turn things around. I also really liked the way scenes transitioned as if they were models used in Mister Roger's show, most of the bold decisions used in some sequences in the film I loved however I do not want to spoil them.On the negative side of things, I thought the score just didn't match the way things were playing out on screen which I thought was quite jarring at times and there were very short spurts of the film being quite slow and some scenes going for longer than what they needed to be.Overall, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood is one of the best written films of the year, which is only magnified by the excellent performances, which talk about important topics that I think need to be mentioned more. A moving film that felt deeply personal to me and makes it a film I won't ever forget.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
258,jamuckley,Perfect Depiction of Mister Rogers' Disarming and Caring Kindness,10,30 December 2019,"I just saw the best movie I have seen all year. I saw the trailer earlier in the year. I love Tom Hanks in everything I've ever seen him in. I have read a few biographies about the life of Mister Rogers and watched last year's critically acclaimed documentary, ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?""This movie was better than all of them.Starring Tom Hanks as Fred Rogers, and Matthew Rhys as a journalist for the magazine Esquire, Lloyd Vogel, the movie is about the disarming and caring humanity of Mister Rogers. The film was directed by Marielle Heller, and also stars Chris Cooper, and Susan Kelechi Watson.Vogel is a hardened journalist who is always looking for the story beneath the story. He is guided by a desire to uncover the truth. When he first meets Mister Rogers, he believes what he is seeing is an act, a facade. Surely, nobody could really care as much as Mister Rogers. He refers to him as a ""saint"" at one point in the film. Joanne Rogers, Fred's wife, reproves him saying:""And if you paint him as a saint, if you say that, then somehow his way of life and the work that he does is unattainable. He worked very hard at it. It was a practice for him."" -Joanne RogersThis quote was central to the film. Mister Rogers had struggles like everyone else. He worked at resolving anger and worked at letting it out in ways that were under control. It was a discipline for him, much like ""emotional"" exercise.Vogel is struggling with his past, his distant father who suddenly reappears in his life, upsetting feelings that had been locked away deep inside. He is struggling with being a first-time parent to a son. In his talks and interviews with Mister Rogers, Vogel finds that much of the time he isn't doing the interview, but he himself is being interviewed. Mister Rogers deeply cares about him and cares about him finding peace and resolving the pain in his own life.The film ultimately is a story of love and caring for others. It is a story about expressing your feelings. It is a story about sharing your fears and your disappointments and not bottling up everything until you explode.The film was a slow burn. It was a tearjerker that confronts you internally with your own past and struggles. It is as much a depiction of how to care for your emotional well-being as it is an internal look into the darkest corners of your heart and your past to deal with things that have long been buried and hidden away. Once we deal with our own feelings, we can then see others in a new way. We can see those around us, even those who have hurt us in the past with a lens of empathy. Forgiveness and grace are common themes throughout the film.""Do you know what forgiveness means? It's a decision we make to release a person from the feelings of anger we have against them."" -Fred RogersThe cinematography in the film is reminiscent of the pace of the television show. In contrast to every other children's program, like Sesame Street, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was slow. It didn't make fast cuts. It was almost boring at times. Yet, children's attention was captured. Fred looked at a single child through the camera, right in the eyes. They knew when they watched that he was looking at them. And that he truly cared about them.The most poignant scene from the film was during a taping of the show. Mister Rogers is trying to put a tent together by himself. He struggles with it. He puts a lot of effort in setting it up. He cannot do it. He makes a joke like, ""Maybe one adult can't put up a tent by himself.""The scene cuts. His assistants ask him if he wants someone to set up the tent for him. He tells them 'no.' He says he wants to use the scene as-is. It was a humorous struggle. When asked about why he doesn't want the tent set up and why he doesn't want to redo the scene, his reply is powerful:""Children need to know that even when adults make plans, sometimes they don't turn out as they hoped."" -Fred RogersAs a parent of three, with many of my plans for my future already falling apart, this quote helped me in a powerful way to grieve again, to let go of those plans, to give myself grace for my own failures, and to move forward.I would be surprised if this film wasn't nominated for Best Picture in this year's upcoming Academy Awards. I believe Tom Hanks should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor, Susan Kelechi Watson for Best Supporting Actress and Marielle Heller for Best Director. All of them were fabulous!Go see this film! It was so good!!",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
259,afrocut,"A tad misleading, but beautiful film nonetheless",7,22 November 2019,"I find myself a bit conflicted about my feelings on ""a beautiful day in the neighborhood"" without using the word , disingenuous. It seems to be advertising it self as the Mr. Roger's movie , having him on the poster , the title a reference to him , and almost all the ads Hank's performance. The truth is it's more about the effect Mr. Roger's had on people (and still does) then a straight biopic. In fact Mr. Roger's is on screen for maybe less then half its run time . But , to be honest, it's ok. It's a very unique and intriguing story and I really enjoyed watching it. It just leaves you wanting more of its greatest moments : the recreation of sets, the transitions between scenes and of course Tom Hanks amazing performance. He truly becomes Fred Roger's , right down to body ticks and glares . Every moment he's on screen joy came across my face and I was whisked back to my childhood .
Unfortunately, something just feels forced about the other half , emotion just doesn't connect the way it should and some scenes feel out of place and oddly humorous. One such scene , a trippy nightmare , sticks out like a sore thumb . Sometimes things feel forced in as Mr. Roger's greatest hits then actual moments from the main characters encounters and they're extremely noticeable and out of place . All of this just doesn't gel into a cohesive piece like it should. You will find , however, a great message that really makes you feel inspired. I guess that's more Mr. Roger's then I give it credit for.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

But I just figured it would be great because it had Tom Hanks in it. But it turned out better than I thought it would be.
Tom Hanks should be very proud of his great performance as Fred Rogers. If Fred was still alive he would also be so proud. Tom played the part very well.
I used to watch Mister Rogers' Neighborhood every morning before school. So watching Tom playing Fred I didn't see much of a difference.

Never heard of Fred Rogers before I saw this movie, but quite frankly, can't grasp why anyone would want to if they were an adult. Hanks is always impecable to watch, but the script doesn't provide him with enough opportunity to create any ongoing interest in his role. Rogers was a child entertainer and his character requires an annoying form of communication to everyone in that same manner. The storyline is fine, but the application of telling it misses the mark and ends up feeling shallow.

It has a good message and the acting was good especially from Tom Hanks, but the story was pretty misleading in the trailers. This isn't really a Mr. Rogers biopic like the trailers make it out to be, it's really a story about a journalist, who is a terrible person. And he meets Mr. Rogers and goes through a very forced and contrived transformation, he's the main character and he wasn't very well developed. The directing and writing were pretty meh. This film will get a lot of undeserved award recognition from the Oscars, which is a shame because there are so many other films this year that are better. Not to mention the documentary about Mr. Rogers from last year, Won't You Be My Neighbor (2018), was fantastic and is better than this film in every way.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

270,Lepidopterous_,A formulaic second half saved by a heartwarming Tom Hanks,7,22 November 2019,"Such a fuzzy feel-good heartwarming film, like putting on Mr. Rogers' big red sweater. The screenplay is incredibly well written in its approach and Tom Hanks is absolutely perfect as his sixth cousin.Unfortunately by the second half of the film, the sweater unravels into formulaic melodrama so structured that you realize you already knew the beats of the film from the very first scene. It avoids going full Ron Howard and keeps a small-world feel, but it never really achieves legitimate poignancy outside of the one-on-one scenes with Hanks.A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood humanizes a saintly hero into an ordinary humble man to help us realize just how capable we all are of the simple kindness Mister Rogers exemplifies. A family film worth watching for the golden moments, the nifty score, and a tender performance from Tom Hanks. Go see it with a friend in need of inspiration and a cup of peppermint hot chocolate.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
271,Vinny37,Behind the façade,8,5 February 2020,"We've just watched A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019). Not knowing about the USA children's host, Fred Rogers, I was worried for the first 10-5 minutes that my wife would be seething that I'd taken her a kiddies flick, such as a Play Away or Play School, as my daughter had to endure when I was a kid. I was asking whether it was really filmed before Ground Zero! And lots of cut-out city views, almost matchstick cats and dogs! Rogers almost looks at the camera (a Hollywood no no) and says 'hello children'! Well, I settled back for an hour or so of groan-inducing humour, but this weird kinda film grew on me.The kiddie setting works as a backdrop to a kiddies host helping to heal a hurting man (or two). In simples, a father had betrayed his son by cheating on and deserting his son's mother. She had died in great pain, leaving the son seeking payback on her behalf. The son, working for a magazine, interviews Rogers, and thus meets a man who has risen above payback (take it out on the piano!), a man who is sincerity itself, and cares for him and his family perhaps more than he does. Can a genuine goody-two-shoes help reconciliation, and is reconciliation worth going for? A very 'nice' film that gets into some serious life & death stuff in a serious way, and to some will make more sense when it ends, even as a sandwich needs at least three layers to make sense.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
272,ociopia,A master was on television and I didn't even realize it.,10,16 December 2019,"I watched Mr. Rogers during my late 20's and early 30's with my daughter. Of course, I thought his gentle immediacy and charm was wonderful. Frankly, I think I thought more than anything he was harmless. I believed I had no real interest in him, and I didn't realize until watching this movie how much he could have taught me about myself and how to live life.Oh so many years have gone by since then. Watching this movie brought difficult feelings. The first half I was flooded with regret over resentments and how I'd struggled my entire life to let go and forgive, not unlike the writer.Then Mr. Roger's grace began to work and I saw myself truly grateful that I'd been able to raise my daughter with acceptance, always knowing she was the best because she was just exactly who she was.Somewhere in the middle of the movie, it dawned on my that Fred Rogers was an ascended being, a master. I do not say that in jest or lightly. I saw it as someone who has studied with several swamis. His insistence on and ability to focus his entire self into the moment at hand is the trait I see that I saw in them. He lived in the moment.His kindness, understanding, acceptance and wisdom are something mankind needs now and always.I see an Oscar coming for Tom Hanks.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
273,nincubura,ABSOLUTE GENIUS SCREENPLAY!,10,28 December 2019,"Even greater context and authenticity of the movie can be understood by first watching the documentary: ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"" (2018).The screenplay is absolute genius, manifesting the psychology background of Rogers, and far transcending any project of Kubrik, Scorsese, Speilberg, Bergman, Altman, Stone, Allen, Lumet, Lee, etc... -- all of whom explore the symptom, the reaction, but not the root cause of feelings -- save for Orson Wells with Citizen Kane, still far ahead of contemporary cinema in psychological depth.More movies need to nudge human evolution forward by incorporating and manifesting the actual science of psychology, and expressing the messages of compassion, empathy, and emotional intelligence.

I grew up with Mr. Rogers and the portrayal I watched was so powerfully unlike the real Mr. Rogers that I had to rethink the thoughts and memories I had of the real Mr. Rogers. In fact, in writing these comments, the only reason I refrain from cursing and shouting my feelings is that I was taught some positive emotional traits by the very same man that Tom Hanks did such a poor job of bringing back into our lives.

Fred Rogers life shows us that God speaks quietly through everything we do. I haven't ranked many movies 10 stars but I would give this one 11 if I could. We are so constantly beat upon by negativity, apathy, pettiness, and evil that we forget to see the value of one another. Hanks does such a masterful job of projecting the persona of Rogers that you will feel like he is speaking directly to you. I have never seen the parable of the mustard seed illustrated more brilliantly. It's one thing to make a movie that celebrates a man and his deeds, quiet though they may be. It's quite another when the portrayal of that man resonates with the Spirit so strongly it reaches out of the screen to tell each of us 'you aren't broken'. That everyone could have such love in their hearts. To which its likely Mr Rogers would say 'well why not? I believe in you'.

It's so fake that the dude asked to remove his name from the script. So here we have a made-up Vogel dude, and everyone pronounces ""fogel"" as ""wohgehl"" the entire film.So we have a lead actor playing an annoying journalist, but he is surrounded exclusively by abusive people. He has an obviously made up annoying wife who gaslights him. He works at an abusive workplace and forced to do stuff that's not in his contract.

The director, Marielle Heller, made great creative choices on how the story is to be told. She tells the story of writer Lloyd Vogel's, played by Matthew Rhys, meeting with Fred Rogers. The creativity is that she shot this film like an Mr. Rogers episode; which is ingenious. The acting is great especially from Tom Hanks. You can tell the seriousness of his craft because he did a great job sounding like and playing Mr. Rogers. Also, I love the humanity of the film. The overall message that we are all human and we have to face are ""demons"" in order to love. Unfortunately, there's one part of this film that I wasn't to find of that is the character Andrea Vogel, played by Susan Kelechi Watson, Lloyd Vogel's black wife. I know this story isn't really about her, but her only role in this film was to be a wife. It was one dimensional. This is problematic because of the stigma of black women's only importance or worth is predicated on being a wife. There's too many roles like this that black women are shown, further pushing this false narrative. Overall, I'll give this movie an 8/10.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

296,lf_macias,Flawed in the execution but good in the overall message,7,12 January 2020,"Movie based on an article published in the magazine Squire in November 1998. It tells the story of the journalist who was commissioned to write an article of Mr. Rogers for a special edition of that magazine dedicated to heroes. In the middle of the talks that both have this man finds the way to have peace and reconciliation with himself, and with his family past.
This film had the ideal premise to become a great classic that squeeze the soul of a few. But I think that it does not achieve it at all because it is narrated in a hurried way and with a sometimes surrealist tone that took me out of history.
It is noted that there are probably scenes left in the editing room that would help to better explain the journalist's arc, and Mr. Rogers' past. Also, without spoilers, the final scene made me confused in what I wanted to convey.
And the surrealist tone in which the journalist's story is presented, as if it were a fragment of Mr. Rogers' program, seemed to me to be an idea that, due to the urgency of the assembly, is poorly executed.
The performance of Tom Hanks was not outstanding, in fact there are scenes where he seemed creepy in his gestures, and even annoying his character.
With all that, I liked the movie indeed. It is very entertaining, and even with the failures there were occasional moments that moved me, and the beginning where we see how the protagonist carries his family relationships hooked me. And of course, the final message of the film speaks literally to the spectators and invites us to feel better with who we are and want to treat our loved ones better.

Having watched this movie I really want to watch the documentary that many reviewers have mentioned.
This is a great movie about forgiveness and redemption.
I'm not going to go into the plot, plenty of other reviewers have already done so.Some actors are limited in their scope and Tom Hanks only seems to be able to do one type of performance, Oscar-worthy! He is great in this.
I think Mathew Rhys is one of the finest actors on screen today, he was amazing in ""The Americans"".
However, if I had one criticism of this film it's that his character is too similar to ""Phillip"" in The Americans, with that same cynical, jaded, world-weary demeanor.

I am glad those who made this movie took their subject, Mr. Rogers, as seriously as he undertook his own mission to minister to young children in his own idiosyncratic way, even as Jesus, no matter what, ministered to the children, telling his impatient disciples, ""suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come into me for of such is the kingdom of heaven.""
My only complaint is that the magnificent musical contributions of Johnny Costa, who has been hailed as the ""white Art Tatum"", gets short shrift in the film. Mr. McFeely and the lady who talks to the hand puppets make their appearance in the film, but not John Costa. When I was little, I wanted to grow up to play jazz piano like I heard in the closing credits on ""Mister Rogers Neighborhood"" every day. To this day, I would love to see Johnny Costa's music for the show as painstakingly transcribed in note-for-note sheet music transcriptions as Art Tatum's or Jelly Roll Morton's recordings and published by the Smithsonian Press. Ah, well...
That said, as a grandchild whose grandparents' sad story is similar to that of the Esquire writer's parents', I went through several facial tissues during the course of this film which is ultimately about hurt and forgiveness and how demonstrating God's love can help mend broken people. As Rankin-Bass' beloved classic, ""The Little Drummer Boy""''s immortal status has shown, this is a visceral theme children, young and old, are forever drawn to.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

The story itself, with Lloyd Vogel's involvement, was a unique delivery that I enjoyed. I laughed a few more times than I expected and maybe my man-harmones were out of joint but I was a tad bit emotional at one point as well. From the start the movie sent me down a street of nostalgia and that alone was worth it.

312,kevinthecritic-15200,You'll Have A Beautiful Day Watching Emotional Drama,8,2 December 2019,"4 out of 5 stars (one of the best of the year)I didn't grow up loving Mister Rogers. While his soothing voice and quiet demeanor lured my younger self to sleep, I have since grown to appreciate Rogers for addressing real-world topics with kids rather than talking down to them. Similarly, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood won't interest kids, but their parents will find an honest yet hopeful drama that, like the man himself, reminds us to keep a positive outlook and see the good in others and ourselves.Jaded investigative journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) has spent his life angry over the misdeeds of his father (Chris Cooper), and has begun to let his work and cynicism overcome his marriage. That cynicism is challenged when his editor assigns him to write a blurb on Pittsburgh icon Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks), the only man who will sit down with him. While Rogers' childlike optimism initially rattles Lloyd, both men slowly open up each other, becoming better people as a result.I joyfully cried through most of A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Playing Mister Rogers would prove daunting for anyone, but Tom Hanks perfectly embodies Rogers' positivity and warmth. Rhys and Cooper are also strong, and flashes of humor keep the film from becoming depressing. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood reminds us all of the importance of being decent human beings to each other and accepting that everyone has good and bad sides that make us who we are. I can't think of a better message to enter the new decade with, nor a better film to preach it.While a perplexingly trippy James and the Giant Peach-esque dream sequence and an overlong final shot prevent a higher rating, A Beautiful Day In the Neighborhood is a well-acted, optimistic outing that will leave a smile on your face, a tear in your eye, and a warm feeling in your heart.

The set and production design by Jade Healy was also rather beautiful, with the incredible miniatures built for the film.Obviously, the main talk of the movie is Tom Hanks and his amazing performance as Fred Rogers. And yes, he shines yet again. Hanks essentially captures every aspect of Mr. Rogers beautifully and builds upon it with his performance and it truly elevates the film. Matthew Rhys also deserves some recognition with this performance as Lloyd Vogel.I will mention, there are some scenes in the movie that may drag a bit too much, particularly in the first act. It doesn't ruin the film as a whole, but it did lose some interest in the scenes.I did appreciate that the film's main character focus was not Mr. Rogers but Vogel himself as the main plot of the film was Vogel and his profile of Mr. Rogers; not about the life of Mr. Rogers but how he is able to change the lives of others.Overall, the movie is pretty good.

🏆(strong Oscar potential for best picture, Tom Hanks for supporting actor, and adapted screenplay)A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (Marielle Heller) is perhaps the most feel-good film of the year. Beautifully demonstrating that Mr. Rogers' lessons are for adults too, this film transports viewers through his world without imposing a confining structural narrative.It is intriguingly funny even though it explores inner pain and anger through themes of fatherhood, heroes, and role models. With perfectly tender scenes to push viewers emotions to the edge, the film portrays how we can all use a little more kindness in our world. This film draws the viewer in. At the screening we saw at TIFF, the entire theatre was still through a whole minute of silent reflection during the film, spellbound in Mr. Rogers' world. The remarkable achievements of A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood would not have been possible without the remarkable talents of Tom Hanks, who perfectly embodied this icon of so many childhoods.

335,Screenthoughts,Movie Review: A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,9,6 November 2020,"I went to see ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" on Thanksgiving with two friends. The theater was empty, which surprised me. I thought it was the perfect selection for a day of reflection and giving thanks. I never watched ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,"" nor did my daughter, who we put in front of ""Sesame Street."" Mr. Rogers was way too slow-moving for the likes of my fast-track mind. I now regret it.The story is one of connection. An angry guy who has just had a child with a much more forgiving wife than I would have been is filled with rage at his father who ran out on a dying mother and two teens. The drunken father shows up now in hopes reconnecting, toward the end of his life, with his relatives who he has done wrong. Our long-suffering new dad is asked to write an article (the film is based on the real-life article, ""Can You Say ... Hero?"" written by Tom Junod for an issue of Esquire magazine in 1998), and finds himself in front of the unrelenting goodness of Mr. Rogers, while himself enduring the pain of a wounded face from a father-son encounter gone wrong. At this point, the audience is given an inside track on what made Mr. Rogers what he was: thirty years of connecting with small children in ways we, unseeing adults didn't take the time to figure out how to do. We get to see what forgiveness is made of and learn how it works so much better than words and actions that fester in us all over time.I found myself crying during the film at times that didn't warrant it - something about old stuffed animals and childhoods gone awry when we didn't even realize it. It will touch you in ways you won't understand and should journal about for days afterward to try to figure out. I'll get back to you when I find the parallels in my own history that made me so raw at the end of this magnificent look at what makes us all tick and how to reset the clock when, as Mr. Rogers points out, we need to.The acting is perfection. At first, I thought Forrest Gump had returned to the screen. Tom Hanks employs a bit of the slow-talking twang of Forrest in his portrayal of Fred Rogers, but either he loses it quickly or I'd become so engrossed in the storyline that I stopped noticing it; I'm not sure which. But the real star of this film is Matthew Rhys, whose native Scottish brogue and Russian spy character from ""The Americans"" was nowhere to be found. He so deftly communicates the transition of angry and hurt to controlled forgiveness and the shedding of that which never serves us well. The man has serious acting chops, and the difference between the roles he plays and the tools he needs to have to play them including simmering rage and decades of hurt, make him a strong contender for awards season. The character of his wife, played by Susan Kelechi Watson, is strong and nurturing throughout. Everyone helps to bring together these two men and their back-and-forth struggle that we each contain within us, which makes this film more than simply entertaining. It is important for us all.There was one thing about this film I didn't enjoy. I felt that the transitions between the fantasy of the set of ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"" and real life wasn't necessary. I have always believed that tricks like this must add some value to the storytelling, but with the exception of dream sequences, they do not. It is the only decision I didn't appreciate by the director, Marielle Heller, whose direction of Melissa McCarthy in ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" which tells the true story of Lee Israel's forgery of famous people's letters in order to survive a dying writing career, was also flawless. Sticking to real-life narratives based on fact but calling for nuanced reasoning to take viewers behind the scenes is her gift to cinema.Behind the Scenes
The film cost approximately $25,000,000 to make. I wonder how much of that went to Hanks.
This is the eleventh film in which Hanks plays a historical figure.
The puppet makers for ""Sesame Street"" fabricated the Rogers' puppets used in the film. Sacrilege?
Rhys and Hanks previously worked together on the film ""The Post."" My favorite quote: ""If you can mention it, you can manage it."" Lesson: Speak the unspeakable aloud.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
336,wesleyarledge-86836,Powerful and Moving. A Film Everyone Needs to See,10,22 November 2019,"I just saw this wonderful movie on opening night, a film based on the true life friendship Fred Rogers had with reporter Tom Junrod (called Lloyd Vogel in the film) and his family, and how their relationship changed Junrod's outlook on life.What a powerful, beautiful, moving, and heartfelt film! I'm not ashamed to admit that it actually did move me to tears, and happy tears at that. Tom Hanks shines as the kindly ordained minister turned children's show host! Possibly not since Forrest Gump has Tom Hanks delivered a finer performance.
This is a film that we all need right now. It's a movie that spreads further Mister Roger's message of self love, love for others, and the power of forgiveness. It really leaves you wanting to be a better person.The film also highlights how Fred Rogers' faith in Jesus Christ let him be a shining light to everyone. Not just children either. He truly was a servant of Christ, and the film honors that and highlights just how big of an impact he had on others. He truly cared for everyone.

Filled with incredibly inconsistent visual choices, an ever-changing narrative direction (none of which you'll find yourself caring for irregardless), and genuinely some of the worst directorial choices I've seen in a long time. And let me say this - I'm a fan of the director Mari Heller, I've enjoyed her films before - they showed talent, and a great thematic filmmaking, but this one is just... embarrassing. It's the type of bad choices that makes you immediately question 'whT really happened here' because you look at the talent of everyone involved and no answer is clear or obvious. Maybe the studio was too involved, maybe producers flexed their power, maybe talent wanted certain things, or maybe the director just got in over their head before they realized it. Either way, this is a great idea, character, story, but the directing and visual choices derail it so quickly and so terribly that you'll find yourself looking around the house trying to find long-undone errands that you can do instead.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Mr. Rogers was a special human being. He meant so much to me and thousands of kids like me. I was really hoping that this would be a tribute to what he accomplished and the battles he fought to get there. Instead, we got a over dramatized snapshot of a his life.
Tom Hanks did a decent job of looking like Mr. Rogers, but his attempt to mimic his speech was a little creepy. In fact, there were a few times during the movie that I caught myself comparing Hanks' Mr. Rogers to a psychotic manipulator. Definitely not the type of reaction that Mr. Rogers deserves!

I was not expecting a richly textured character study that explores emotional trauma and forgiveness. The movie is really about the Matthew Rhys character, and Fred Rogers serves as an 'antagonist' of sorts. Heller avoids the usual traps of biopics by limiting scope, focusing on humanity, and elevating material with creative strokes (animation, music, surreal dream + memory sequences).There is also some underlying meta commentary on Tom Hanks career and what he means to present society, including a scene talking about Fred's puppets that couldve been Andy in Toy Story talking about Woody.

Mr. Hanks does about what you would expect: play a complicated person with professionalism and competence, showing the actor at times, but focusing on the character. Mr. Rogers' story is truly interesting, and this film shows Rogers on a deeper level and shows more insights into his psyche. The real star of this film is Matthew Rhys. His character is torn between family issues and the duty to practice his journalism with integrity and understanding. He does an excellent job showing the emotions that easily come up in families. I winced several times watching him manage his feelings about his father and family. Truly convincing. If you have ever had family issues that were hard to face and discuss, this will resonate. Mr. Rhys has a cornucopia of facial expressions at his command. He is on a par with Meryl Streep in this sense. A strong contrast to some American actors who can barely manage a smile or a frown when confronted with emotional challenges. (See ""Dances with Wolves"" for example.) It's great to see such nuanced acting, and he richly deserves an award for this part.

375,spartanbuff,Outstanding in every way.,10,25 November 2019,"We went to the late showing of this last night.It left us profoundly moved. Its powerful message (without being ""messagey"") lingers strongly afterward.Despite what seems to be promoted in its trailer, it is not in spirit a recreated episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, though the show is used - brilliantly - as a framing device to tell its story.Esquire journalist Lloyd Vogel, a glum, deeply unhappy man, is assigned - ordered - by his boss to write a piece about Fred Rogers, with a ""hero"" angle. The character of Vogel is loosely based on real-life journalist Tom Junod.Lloyd, whose writing is permeated by his own negativity, is resistant, discomfited, and extremely wary of Rogers' deep-seated, genuine goodness. Lloyd tries, via research and old video tapes, to find some contradictory evidence of Rogers as a counterpoint, but can't; the writer is completely flummoxed as to how to *present* the iconic man and children's TV personality as separate entities. He finds that there is no gap; Mister Rogers is Mister Rogers, on and off the screen.Instead, Rogers, sincerely and without any cunning maneuvers, fairly turns the tables on the recalcitrant and fearful Vogel; the writer finds he can't escape the keen instincts of his subject, and is forced to face his own demons and tormented family history.It is Mister Rogers' kindness that transforms Lloyd. And everyone else.Tom Hanks adds yet another indelible characterization to his sizable gallery of defining portrayals. I would hazard that playing Fred Rogers must have been perhaps Hanks' most difficult assignment. Mister Rogers is so definitive a man, a personality, a law unto himself, that it is well-nigh seemingly impossible to even imagine that he can accurately be replicated by anyone else; he is really not reproduceable. An actor would have to be, himself, ideally, of sterling character, but yet having the technique and range to depict the most guileless sincerity and goodness without a hint of smarminess or calculation.Hanks achieves this remarkable feat, and how. He is the perfect actor for playing Mister Rogers, and the performance is just about flawless.Equally effective is Matthew Rhys as Vogel. Rhys' Lloyd conveys a man of deep depression and unhappiness; he looks unwell, mentally sick, and anger, suspicion, and contempt for humanity oozes out of his very being. Trauma and resentment has left Lloyd appearing visibly spent and exhausted by life. Rhys announces himself as an outstanding actor in this performance.Chris Cooper turns in another of his formidable characterizations as Lloyd's terrible father.The rest of the cast does their part.Marielle Heller, the director, handles this with keen, absolute certainty, and makes sure that no false sentimentality compromises the proceedings; it is a skillful, and imaginative job on her part. This is, somewhat unexpectedly, a rather intense, occasionally very dark movie that confronts familiar, universal themes of family and interpersonal dysfunction: but also, very credibly, about redemption - and complete forgiveness.It may even foster healing for some. Sadly, it also may not.Humans are complicated, frustrating beings.But making choices, seeking out chances for healing remain open possibilities.The movie is a winner.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I do highly recommend the documentary and the biography ""The Good Neighbor"" for those more interested in the life of Mister Rogers, but this film is important in showing just how impactful this man was (and how his legacy still is). He was an original man with original perspectives and this movie shows the transition from ""he's just too good to be true"" to ""he REALLY was this good, and really was this true"".

Michael Rhys delivers a beautiful, complex, and even heartrending character we can all identify with. He wears his anger openly and comes to learn that it is deeply rooted in fear. His character's journey is one the audience shares. We understand his pain, his confusion, his trauma, and his frustration when dealing with the nicest guy in the world. But we also grow with him.

403,sumeerm-18507,It was truly a beautiful day at the movies!!! :-),9,24 November 2019,"A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
Directed by Marielle Heller
The first five minutes of Marielle Heller's A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood are pure nostalgia. Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue's screenplay beautifully crafts Mr. Rogers as the storyteller of a troubled journalist. I was instantly reminded of my childhood when the film began in the same manner and rhythm as Mister Rogers Neighborhood would begin. Marielle Heller, her cinematographer, Jody Lee Lipes; and her editor, Anne McCabe, beautifully and subtly immerse the audience in the world of Mr. Rogers. The use of the cameras that were used to film Mister Rogers Neighborhood augments how personal this film is on a technical and emotional level. The 4:3 aspect ratio of the TV cameras, expanding to the 16:9 aspect ratio of the film convey the film's theme on how, as adults, we leave our childhood behind. As adults, we forget the essence of what makes life, truly, worth living and acknowledge the people who have helped us become the person that we want to become. Matthew Rhys' character, Lloyd Vogel, who is a jaded journalist from Esquire, embodies this sad emotion of how, as we get older, we tend to feel uncomfortable in expressing our feelings and emotions. The angel that comes into his life, and patiently listens to him, is none other than the most beloved human being, Fred Rogers, played by America's Sweetheart, Tom Hanks. Lloyd Vogel is sent to interview Mr. Rogers and write a profile on him. However, the roles reverse, when Mr. Rogers starts asking Lloyd about his family and his childhood. And this is where the film becomes a therapeutic form of cinema and storytelling.
Tom Hanks, as Mr. Rogers, telling the audience, on the silver screen, that, ""I like you, just the way you are!"", is equally as comforting as getting a warm hug from your parents. Tom Hanks embodies the spirit, personality, and mannerisms of Fred Rogers with a very nuanced and spiritual performance. Every time he is on screen, one feels an everlasting emotion of happiness, love, and joy! Tom Hanks not only portrays the everlasting kindness and compassion of Fred Rogers; he beautifully portrays the spirituality and resilience of Fred Rogers in a countless number of scenes. Whether he sings all the iconic songs from Mister Rogers Neighborhood, uses the puppets to convey his innocent feelings, or smiles ruefully at everyone he meets, Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his career since Captain Phillips. Matthew Rhys is equally brilliant as the cynical Lloyd Vogel. His screen presence and subtle performance makes the audience empathize with him and root for him, as he is being listened to Fred Rogers. Matthew Rhys gives an empathetic performance as someone, who doesn't realize the value of his childhood and his family. As he gradually becomes more accepting and forgiving, one is truly moved to tears by the end of the film. Chris Cooper as Lloyd's father is excellent; especially in one scene, where he beautifully symbolized the essence of self-reflection and forgiveness. The performances in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood are incredibly ethereal.
Marielle Heller directs the film with an immense amount of sincerity and sensitivity. She beautifully prevents the film from being too melodramatic. Marielle Heller her editor, Anne McCabe, transitioning from scene-to-scene by using the toy model from Mister Rogers Neighborhood, innocently convey the film's endearing sentiments on acceptance, forgiveness, and kindness. However, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood does suffer from certain scenes that are oddly placed. Particularly a dream sequence, which didn't really retain to the genuineness that were present in the scenes prior to the sequence. The humor in these scenes feel out of place and could've easily been cut from the film. The use of songs, in small moments, feel a bit intrusive to the rhythm of the film's screenplay.
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is film that reinforces the idea and fact that a simple act of kindness can truly leave an everlasting impact on someone. This film reminds you that it is ok to convey your feelings. It is ok to feel sad at times. It is ok to make mistakes. Tom Hanks' beautiful and compassionate portrayal of Fred Rogers, Mathew Rhys and the entire cast delivering remarkable performances, a beautifully structured screenplay by Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, and Marielle Heller's nostalgic and sincere directing style culminate together and craft A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood as being the most healing film of the year. As you leave the theater, you will truly feel that listening to others and being accepting towards everyone make life worth living. We should seek blissful moments of silence and think about all those people who have helped us become the person we are today. With moments of self-reflection, we will realize that, ""It's such a good feeling to know you're alive."" (-:",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

432,FilmAddictJenn,It's a beautiful way to pass your time,10,4 February 2020,"This is a film with no ultra scary or intense action thriller moments; in fact it's a film that couldn't be more opposite, but somehow in many ways much more likable than many of the mega blockbusters.I initially came away thinking the story was slow and steady, but a pleasant way to pass the time.The more I thought about the film, not least because the song/theme tune is constantly going around my head, the more, in hindsight, I like it, and smile thinking about it.It's a wonderfully positive story about an inspirational person, Mr Rogers, who appreciates all aspects of life, and the cynical journalist who is told to write a piece on Mr Rogers. There's so much more to the story, but don't want to give away any spoilers.Knowing it's inspired by a true story, the set, the music and Tom Hanks' portrayal of Mr Rogers made me curious, so I did a little bit of research after watching this film. Having found original footage of Mr Rogers singing and the set, I was incredibly surprised to see how accurate they all were, which has only gone to make the film even more endearing.On YouTube I also found a beautiful version of Kelly Clarkson giving her interpretation of 'It's a Beautiful Day in The Neighbourhood'. That's also worth checking out.From going in with mediocre expectations and, admittedly, some cynicism about the integrity of Mr Rogers, I find the film has left me with warm, fuzzy, positive feelings, partially it's shown me that there are some genuinely beautiful people people in this world.Do a little research of your own after watching the film, and fill your head with the earworm, and you'll be sure to smile too.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

434,kim-26824,Bait and Switch,4,30 November 2019,"The marketing and title leads one to believe this movie was about the wonderful person that was Fred Rogers. Instead this movie is a story about a notoriously critical journalist writing about Mr. Rogers and the impact it had on him.
While Hanks does well at portraying Fred Rogers, who I understand is his 6th cousin, this movie tells you little of who you are lead to believe is the central character.
Watch 'Wont You Be My Neighbor?' (2018) instead
Mr. Rogers was shy, introverted child with health issues that became president of student council, member of honors society, obtained multiple degrees including music graduating magna cum laude, seminary, ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church, ... He wrote and edited all the episodes, played the piano and sang for most of the songs, wrote 200 songs, created all the characters, played most of the major puppet roles, hosted every episode, produced and approved every detail of the program.
Fred attended graduate School of Child Development, and worked closely with a child psychologist. taught young children about civility, tolerance, sharing, and self-worth, tackled difficult topics such as the death of a family pet, sibling rivalry, the addition of a newborn into a family, moving and enrolling in a new school, and divorce.

As avid movie goer's you go to biopics or movies based on true stories expecting scandal or at least some sort of unexpected behaviour. I am so glad I went to see this movie and see that good good men exist in this world. Tom Hanks does a magnificent job portraying a well loved children's entertainer and will be surprised if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal as Mr Rogers.

It was a shame that barely anyone was in the cinema to witness this amazing film. An amazing bond between Lloyd Vogel and Mr Rodgers. The 60 seconds of silence was the most impactful thing I've witnessed in cinema in a long time. Mr rodgers legacy was respected and admired in the most beautiful way here and Tom Hanks was the perfect man for the job. The message that it is ok to recognize and reflect on good and bad feelings.

441,skycurb,Great Tom Hanks and not much else,4,2 February 2020,"I have to say I expected a lot more. Tom Hanks was wonderful as usual, and the parts with him held my attention. Rest of the movie, not so much. The turning point for the main journalist character is confusing to me. I don't think movie ever gives us a reason for the switch and how it involves Mr Rodgers. He just suddenly bacame a forgiving son and loving father because... Mr Rodgers goodness rubbed off on him? Just by his presence? The only explanation given for the change of heart is the dream sequence with his mother. Mr Rodgers doesn't say anything all that profound to Lloyd. I left the theatre feeling vaguely puzzled. Other reviewers keep mentioning the message of the movie. Which is? Key smash your anger away? There is hard work involved in being good, but it's managable? Forgive your parents? Mr Rodgers was human too? And is it really that hard to forgive the father who became a repenting and loving figure in his later years? The plot just doesn't hold for me. In my cinema people were chatting and audibly yawning during his father 'touching' 4am speech. That alone say a lot.
After leaving the theatre I have a vague interest to look up real Mr Rodgers. I still very much want to watch Tom Hanks in other roles. But I have next to no interest in watching anything with the same director, script writer or main actor/actress.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Indeed, I found myself thinking about it not only as I was trying to get to sleep the same evening, but the following day. So much so that I brought it up in conversation with everyone I spoke with.Irrespective, in the beginning thanks in the main to cinematography akin to what one would expect from a children's TV show in the 1980's, I wondered why I was wasting my time. However as the movie forged ahead I became immersed, I had a smile on my dial for the most part, I was wonder when the jig was going to be up and when the storyline would change.But that in itself was what kept my eyes transfixed to the TV.

So many of them point out that there is a documentary about his life and how we should watch that. Great - I'll do that and it will in no way diminish this film, which beautifully shows us WHY Mr Rodgers is special and precisely what he brought to the world. He focussed on others, making himself a subtle, modest and yet tremendously impactful influence in their lives and the film mirrors this. The journalist that the film appears to be centred around represents the cynicism of the modern world, taken on a journey towards love and acceptance by his gentle and kind presence. I felt like I was on that journey too as I watched. As the journalist came to meet his real self, in a small way, so did I. As if Mr Rogers was teaching me to face my feelings as he did for so many through his shows. Could there be a more simple elegant way to demonstrate the essence of the man?

465,admitchell2-927-32622,It needs more Mr. Rogers,7,13 December 2019,"Unpopular opinion, but I actually didn't care much for the film. It's my fault for not reading more about the movie beforehand, but Tom Hanks playing Mr. Rogers (two of my favorite people) was all I needed to know to buy a ticket. What else would it be about but a biopic of Mr. Rogers? The movie is actually about a man named Lloyd interviewing Mr. Rogers while fighting with his father back home. Lloyd's family problems are the main plot of the film, and I'm sorry to say that I was bored to tears during the family scenes because I just didn't care. I wanted to learn about Mr. Rogers and HIS life.Obviously a movie needs conflict, and there was plenty of conflict in Fred Rogers' real life, with the childhood bullying, getting a TV show, getting the funding to stay on the air, people upset with him later on after his misleading ""you're special"" message, etc. If you're lucky enough to have Tom Hanks play Fred Rogers in your movie, then the whole movie needs to be Tom Hanks playing Fred Rogers. That being said, I did appreciate the accuracy of the Mr. Rogers scenes. Tom Hanks did an outstanding job portraying Rogers, from the slow talking right down to how he stood and how he walked.I loved the behind the scenes scenarios, like the producers being frustrated with him for taking his time and being behind schedule, and how he liked to re-watch every clip before moving on. And it was nice to see the real Joanne Rogers and Mr. McFeely in the restaurant. Still, toward the end, I found myself impatiently waiting for it to be over because I was so disappointed in how it was produced. I'll easily take the documentary ""Won't You Be My Neighbor"" over this.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

It also gives me a theory,10,23 July 2021,"Tom Hanks Is My Favorite Actor Of All Time, as I Grew Up with the Toy Story Franchise, and especially The Polar Express (My Favorite Movie Ever Made!!!). And I Have Fun with Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood (The Spinoff, and I Actually prefer it over the original, say what you want about it but it's my opinion). I Loved the performance of Tom Hanks. He Was CASTING GOLD!!!! Best Movie of 2019 along with Toy Story 4 (Also with Hanks!). Now here's my theory, If Tom Hanks was Mr Rogers, that means that The Polar Express, and Toy Story could be set in the same universe as Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.

Tom Hanks mesmerizes as Fred Rogers, the disarmingly nice presenter of a children's TV show (yes, Hanks was born for this role) and Matthew Rhys is convincing as the abrasive magazine reporter who really was sent to interview him in 1998. The hard-bitten journo is torn - like everyone else, he falls for Rogers' angelic charm but his natural cynicism tells him it's all an act.

474,cmlawson725,"A beautiful day in this neighborhood, if you let it!",10,24 November 2019,"Having finally viewed this film last night, after months, weeks, and days of anticipation, hoping it would live up to the hype surrounding Tom Hanks's much lauded performance and Matthew Rhys's role as a composite of different people, including Tom Junot, whose article in Esquire magazine was the major impetus and starting point for the film, I can safely say it definitely lived up to it, and then some! Indeed, there were moments when I wasn't seeing Tom Hanks, but Fred Rogers, himself. Certainly, there have been people who have complained, commented, argued that Tom Hanks does not ""look"" like Fred Rogers, doesn't have the same speech inflection, and appears very little in the film. The main thing to keep in mind is that they were not going for an all out biopic of Fred Rogers. Rather, they were showing us the impact he has had on other people, including our main character, played brilliantly by Rhys. The essence, the spirit, and the presence of Fred Rogers was what was important: who cares if Tom Hanks didn't look or sound like Rogers? They captured his spirit, his humanity, and his presence! Tom Hanks is, without a doubt, the finest actor of modern cinema. He makes you believe the characters he plays, even with the little flaws. Case in point: Jim Lovell is left-handed, and Tom is right-handed; who cares? He took you on the Apollo 13 with the rest of the crew and he captured the essence of what it was like on that ill-fated mission!
Okay, rant over.
This movie moved me to tears, sometimes laughter, and then tears again. I really believe the real Fred Rogers would have just been tickled being played by Tom Hanks, having said Forrest Gump was one of his favorite movies, having seen it 40 times, and Tom Hanks was his favorite actor. Only Tom Hanks could make the little moments work, commanding his screen presence and asking of you, dear viewer, to for one minute, think of all the people who have touched your life and made you who you are today. Can you think of any other actor who would ask this and you do as asked? Probably not. It is his sincerity, looking straight at you. You are completely mesmerized and if you're caught up in the movie, you will follow suit.
As for Matthew Rhys. He was truly remarkable as Lloyd Vogel. Yes, it is his movie, in spite of Tom Hanks figuring most prominently in the movie posters, trailers, etc. Yet, Tom allowed Matthew to shine, not stealing scenes away from him, but allowing Matthew to bring the movie together. He is, in so many ways, the audience. The audience watching Mr. Rogers. And the same audience has no choice but to acknowledge there have been people in our lives who have wronged us, deserted us, and hurt us, but there are also people who have loved us, shared themselves with us, grew up with us, nurtured us, and encouraged us.
The rest of the supporting cast were just that, supporting. They helped move the story along and you cheer for them, weep for them, understand them, and ultimately, you feel as if they are your own family, friends, or associates.
So while you may feel duped, instead, take the time to allow yourself to appreciate the beautiful story. Do not be cynical. There could be much worse ways of spending the hour and fifty minutes it takes to watch the movie. Yes, I know some would be bored. And that's okay. But if you like good stories with a positive spin, even fantastic at times, just take some deep breaths and allow yourself to be taken. And in a good way!
I hope Fred would've said, ""I appreciate your point of view."" If you took the time to read this, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you.

I never grew up with Mr. Rogers personally, in fact I'd never even heard of him until Won't You Be My Neighbour was released so I have no nostalgia for Mr. Rogers' show. Perhaps that's why I was able to enjoy this movie so much, but I, like many others went into this movie expecting a biopic of Fred Rogers and was still very pleased with what we got. Even though Lloyd is not a particularly good person, I think we all see a bit of ourselves in him. An individual who has been dragged down by past hardships and the daily struggle of life, and is then reminded to be a better person and to leave grudges behind and take responsibility. The messages are really quite simple, but Tom Hanks does an amazing job as Mr. Rogers and making them thought provoking and powerful.

Yes, Fred's lifestyle and approach was different than that of many people. That lifestyle, however, changed the lives of many people leading them to find peace and faith in their lives. His faithful dedication to the Lord and follow-through with God's direction and ministry within his life as he lived his faith changed the lives of many people who watched him and learned from him how to make their lives better and more meaningful in simple ways even a child could understand. This is a real life story. It is not 'preachy' but it is an uplifting and true story that will provide a deeper insight into this simple man and how he changed lives as he lived a life dedicated to his faith and truth. God uses his faithful followers, who may not be the most well known or wealthy people in life, to touch lives around them bringing the answers of peace and assurance that we all seek in this life... This is a powerful story that will speak to you and provide new respect, reverence, and insight into one of God's own... I read the Esquire article on-line about Fred Rogers following this film that was written about this life ""hero"" in 1998 and it revealed more giving additional insight and appreciation of this dedicated life of a servant to others...

I went in wondering how such a well known actor would play such a well known person yet he did become our beloved Mr Rogers on screen complete with intentional slower pace and gentle nature.The true power of the film though, comes from the care that Fred shows for Lloyd, at times seeking him out to help him find his way through a lifetime of anger that came from resentment. Lloyd calls himself broken but Fred disagrees. How many in the audience might feel the same way as Lloyd?As someone who has seen most of Mr Rogers' interviews I was happy to notice some of the most important points shown in the film. I suggest you search for the interviews as they will give you even more of what you were feeling during and hopefully after this film.When this medium works it not only tells a story, it helps you become more aware of who you are and how you feel.

I'm unconvinced that Lloyd has changed or that he won't make some grueling mistakes with Gavin himself.Lloyd doesn't feel like he was able to resolve things with himself but it felt more like Mr Rogers would like Lloyd to have resolved things with himself.Not good.Or maybe intentional?",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

489,quincyq03-852-728251,Not at all what I expected,6,27 November 2019,"I went into the theatre expecting more of a biography than a melodramatic piece.Say what you will, but I felt Hanks' performance of Mr. Rogers was what saved this film from being a utter flop. With that said, Mr. Rogers feels like a secondary character in the plot, which gets increasingly predictable and cliché by the latter part of the film.The film starts off with a seemingly unexpected plot twist, which honestly grabbed my attention. About halfway through, aside from a few stellar scenes with Hanks, the storyline seemed to diverge farther into an exaggerated and overly predictable ""feel good"" drama.The pacing was also too jumpy for me. Just when you thought you'd actually learn something deep about Fred Rogers, the movie cut away to the ""real"" plot that had more to do with the investigative journalist, than Fred Rogers as a man.Let me be clear, the pacing was not bad when it got slow. It was so slow at times that it almost made you uncomfortable, but that's because Hanks nailed Mr. Rogers. If you never watched him in the 90s or earlier, I could see how you might be thrown off with just how slow and abnormal his character comes off as. Unfortunately, the slow pacing is offset erratically by the dramatic acting that comes off as borderline forced by the journalist's family.Overall, the unexpected start to the film grabbed my attention, Hanks performance during the first half kept me interested, but I almost got up and left the theatre in the second half when the plot became uninterestingly predictable and Hanks screen-time lessened.6/10 because Hanks gave a strong performance, but without him it would have been maybe a 3 or 4 at best.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

This is a movie that proves filmmakers felt they couldn't make an interesting story out of the life of Fred Rogers so they had to inject it with yet another cliche family drama about yet another man with daddy issues. I am fine with movies taking some dramatic license it is almost expected but this ratio of fact to fiction is about 10% fact and 90% fiction.

516,priti_nb,Managing life well,9,28 October 2020,"A beautiful day in the neighborhoodI like feelgood movies. This is one of those of course... But it has much more than that. It is the story of Lloyd as told by Mr Rogers. Mr Rogers is a popular TV celebrity hosting a show for children. Lloyd is assigned the task to interview him for the magazine where he works.
Spending time with Mr. Rogers helps Loyd to rediscover himself, his relationships with his child, wife and his estranged father.
A beautiful day in the neighborhood is a story of human values, relationships and perspectives. How little things and moments in our life and not so little, not so unimportant.
It is a movie which emphasizes that sometimes adults need to understand things from the perspective of children and so a person who has been hosting a children's show for years can change the life of an adult.
It is very interesting to note that the fears which we cling to in our childhood are carried into our adulthood and we try to run from these situations regularly.
It may not be hard to become Mr Rogers but it is the journey towards becoming Mr Rogers that is tedious. Very few people can complete that journey.
Tom Hanks is cent percent Mr Rogers. Matthew Rhys as Lloyd , Chris Cooper as Jerry (Lloyd's father) balance it well.
Some movies touch your soul, we may not change our ways after seeing them, but surely they remain with us forever. A beautiful day.... Is such a movie.
As Mr Rogers says, What is mentionable is manageable, and what is manageable is mentionable'. Life always has such moments, and most of us do manage it well... most of the times 😊",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

The movie's main storyline is about a writer who was assigned to write about Mr. Rogers and ends up battling issues from his past. It's on me for not doing enough research going in, but just know that before going to see it.The acting overall is very good. I thought Matthew Rhys was very believable in his role and did a great job selling his emotional scenes. The others were solid as well, although I felt Tom Hanks came off a bit creepy at times. If that was intended then they nailed it, but some scenes felt a bit odd.Overall, if you liked Tuesdays with Morrie then you'll love this.

Lloyd was an uninteresting character, and since his story was the main focus of this movie, I considered this movie to be a rip-off. It was titled A Wonderful Day in the Neighborhood. It had Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers on the movie advertisement. Yet Mr. Rogers is in only maybe a third of this movie.

527,lamboy14,A film to remind us the power of being kind!,10,30 November 2019,"Directed by Marielle HellerStarring Tom Hanks, Mathew Rhys, Chris CooperMr. Rogers is a well-known children's tv personality. I entered the film knowing little about him, the main motivation for me was the great Tom Hanks.I loved how the film used the normal opening for Mr. Rogers's show as an intro to the story. Lloyd is a writer for a magazine and he is assigned to write a piece about Fred Rogers famous for his kids tv show. At first meeting the skeptic writer could not believe that Rogers was such a good person. As he kept meeting Rogers he discovers more about himself than about Rogers.What a beautiful story and to hear the writer of the article from which the movie is based that minor few details the things shown in the film are true makes it even more amazing. Tom Junod was assigned to do a piece and he says that Rogers picked him because he felt he could help him, and he did. This movie inspires us to remember that we are all the same and how we can change someone's life just by being kind. It dis not sell Mr. Rogers as a perfect man, it just showed a man who cared and tried to bless everyone around him.The style of the film I felt was unique and really used Fred Rogers as a figure that moves the story rather than a bio-film about him. The story is about Lloyd really and it made it better that if it was just a bio-pic, it gave it heart.Tom Hanks, what else is there to say about one of the best actors of all time. He is wonderful in this film. He is in my top 5 this year to be nominated for Best Actor in Oscar's and Golden Globes. I did not know that Chris Cooper was in this film and he was also great. The cast really were are good, I don't know other films where Mathew Rhys has appeared on, but he did a great job at showing the characters transitions through the film.It is a sad story at times, but also a refreshing story about the power of love and forgiveness.

530,zeitagap,Uplifting though underwhelming,7,23 November 2019,"Great great movie. Hanks became Mr Rogers in a breathtaking way. The problem was, the film wasn't about Mr Rogers. It was about the man who interviewed him and drew inspiration from his message and spirit. This film could have been so so much more if it was about the trials and triumphs of Mr Rogers, his history, his flaws and how they helped him nurture his virtues. You didn't really learn anything about the man, however. His wife was written into a few scenes; I bet she was an intriguing woman as well. You never got to know her either. This film was pretty much about a writer who was having a rough time finding himself. He stumbles upon growth after meeting and becoming inspired by Roger's deliberate and unassuming character.
I'm happy I saw this, it made me want to find a book written by Rogers to learn about this man with the weird puppets, who seems more inspiring to me than Gandhi-- who is someone who has always inspired and impressed me.
So... see it! It's good movie that will make you feel light inside. However, Phoenix still gets the best actor award for 2019 in my book, where it could have been hank had he had more screen time.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
531,chris_cooper4,Strong movie with a worthwhile message,7,7 February 2020,"First admission: I'm British.
I'm pretty sure that prior to seeing the trailer for this movie any thoughts of who or what Mr Rogers was would likely have come up with an answer involving cowboys. Given this I obviously have no point of reference for judging Tom Hank's performance as an impersonation - or indeed for the cultural impact of his TV show.
In general I like this way of approaching a movie. Rather than a long drawn out biopic of a famous person we just see them during a brief snippet of their lives which illuminates their character without having to see their entire life story. In fact in this case Mr Rogers is the catalyst to the main story arc of Matthew Rhys' character.
Whilst to these eyes Rogers comes across as a little weird and slightly creepy albeit motivated by a very pure heart, Rhys' Lloyd Vogel is a very believable work oriented , cynical investigative journalist still scarred by his relationship with his father. Rhys himself is new to me having missed all his TV series and whilst he's been in a couple of movies I've seen in recent years he's not made any impact on me. He's very good in this, and the movie is very watchable largely due to his efforts.

It is an example of a story in which the focal person (the beloved TV host Fred Rogers) works as a support to the narrative, rather than being on-screen for the bulk of the screen time. It gives Rogers a subtle emotional heft, a role of the support system for the movie, the protagonist, as well as for millions of parents and children worldwide."" I don't think anybody can grow unless he really is accepted exactly as he is.""""Anything mentionable is manageable.""
Fred Rogers had a rare quality in him - which I felt very deeply while watching the movie. It's the talent of healing someone using a very sweet and concise quote. Even if he had suffered a lot in his life, he was kind.Tom Hanks, who plays Rogers, had huge shoes to fill. But the smoothness by which he embodies the essence of Rogers is astounding. Physically, you see Hanks, but emotionally, you see Rogers. There is a specific scene in a restaurant, where Rogers asks the protagonist Lloyd Vogel (played brilliantly by Matthew Rhys) to spend one minute in silence, and then looks towards us, the audience. It is the most emotionally liberating part of the movie. Lloyd Vogel's emotional transformation, his relationship with his father (another fine performance by Chris Cooper), and his eventual forgiveness for him are portrayed beautifully.This is a movie which should be watched by everyone - no matter the age. It is a brilliant homage to a person who justified that love/kindness (and not violence/rudeness) is the path towards healing. And that age is not necessarily a measure of wisdom. A person who was flawed, like all of us, but who refused to let go of his kindness despite all the atrocities around him. A person who practiced what he preached, let it be at his own home, or with other people. It is a message that not many films depict nowadays with such poignancy. It is a movie that can act as a spoonful of healing, for a lot of emotionally broken people.And hence it is a masterpiece.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I never thought that Tom Hanks' version of sweet and kind Mr. Rogers would creep me out, but his one-dimensional portrayal made my skin crawl. Hanks nailed the mannerisms for how he would talk for the children's show, except he acted the same in every situation and with every other person. It seemed like he was using ""baby talk"" with adults which insults Fred Rogers capabilities and many accomplishments.Further, I thought the movie would be about Mr. Rogers' life. Nope! His story line was minor and secondary to an uninteresting tale about a journalist who interviews him for a publication. Given that ""journalists"" today are held in the same low regard once reserved for used car salesmen, gaining audience sympathy isn't easy...especially when they feel a bait and switch with who is really the main character.The movie was not the kind of tribute to Mr. Rogers that it could have been had the story centered around him and his life & legacy.

I thought the script portrayed Mr. Rogers very 1 dimensional though. Most humans struggle with things and it's how they work through them that makes them lovable. This film lacked emotional depth to Mr. Roger's character. By far the worst thing about this film is Tom Hanks acting. He's a great actor and I love him in many other films, but he missed the mark entirely on this film. The one quality that Mr. Rogers is known for is his calmness and ability to live in the moment. Tom Hanks came across nervous, like he couldn't wait to get his shoe tied to move on to the next activity. It was like watching a hyper-active kid with ADHD try and play Mr. Rogers.

547,shadowtail-81463,Not the Mr. Rogers I remember,1,29 November 2019,"First, I'd not read anything about this film before shelling out the money to see it on Thanksgiving Day. Having grown up watching Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, I anticipated learning more about the man I loved, Fred Rogers. Instead, I was treated to a movie about journalist Tom Junod, a broken individual, carrying a lot of baggage, and his struggle to learn to forgive his father. After suffering through this depressing film, I'm still not certain why he was so upset with his father to begin with! I so would have enjoyed a biopic on Fred Rogers, but I guess I should have known from the title.Also, as a child, I remember Daniel, the striped rabbit, being sad and facing a lot of difficult issues, but I certainly don't remember Mr. Roger's Neighborhood being a psychology lesson. Tom Hanks portrayal of his ""6th Cousin"" was so off, it was distracting. I'm not sure who Tom Hanks was portraying, but it certainly did not come across as the positive, caring, Fred Rogers I grew up with. His portrayal of Fred Rogers was just strange. So, to put his face on this, and market this as a movie about Mr. Rogers is just wrong.I'm sure Hollywood thought they were doing us all a favor, but the people who would benefit from this movie, won't go see it, because Fred Rogers wasn't alive during their lifetime. As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think about all the young people who require a ""safe space"" and are offended by every word that comes out of another's mouth. If Mr. Roger's Neighborhood taught my generation how to deal with our feelings, (as depicted in this movie) than this is exactly the kind of programming that our young people, and many of our politicians, need today!",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
548,theepiggwilburr,Maybe I just haven't gone through the experiences,5,16 March 2020,"Knowing how influential Mister Rogers was in his prime I decided to give this movie a try. A lot of times I'll say ""oh it was worth a watch"" and it's possible I haven't gone through the experiences the journalist went through but I had no connection to the storyline. The actor who played the journalist did not express his feelings whatsoever (maybe that was the point) but his lack of depth did not help me care about what he was going through.
Tom Hanks' voice is so nice and calm throughout this movie which was relaxing for me. This movie isn't really about Mister Rogers, he's more of a side plot.
One character I was particularly interested in was Mister Rogers' wife. I was so curious about how she and Mister Rogers came to meet, how she deals with a man like that on a daily basis. Now, that's a movie that would've interested me.
Mister Rogers' message from the past did come through; about recognizing feelings and responding appropriately, to be okay with who you are, and talking about those feelings is okay but the movie overall is very slow paced and depending on who you are as a person, might not be worth a watch.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I grew up in the UK so only know Mr Rogers from references in other shows (a notable event one in one of my other favourites ""This is us"") or some excerpts in documentaries or the news when he passed away. I really enjoyed the way the story of the two main characters was interwoven and was presented like a feature in one of the shows. Matthew Rhys was well cast and delivers his role to perfection also. I thought it was beautifully creative to link in the pastiches and model cities.I am surprised by its relatively low overall score and would say to anyone considering watching it to give it a go- it's not just entertainment but really food for thought and if you feel your faith in humanity needs a little restoration this could be just the ticket.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

556,faidai,Cultural differences abound!,5,11 November 2021,"This film was so sweet it made my teeth ache! I think it demonstrated perfectly the difference between American sensibilities & British ones. It was overpoweringly cloying & sentimental &, to be honest, I found ""Mr Rogers"" positively creepy. He deliberately side steps questions with his persona intact & no-one in the film seems to have the critical nous to challenge it. The scene in which he conducts a conversation with Vogal via his puppets made my skin crawl. I felt, all the way through, that he was a master manipulator who could find a way to deflect any & all questions meant to find out who he really was.I understand that Rogers was a real person who did have a show that ran for many years. All I can say is, I'm hugely grateful that he didn't make it onto British t.v, not that I think ANY British child would have found him as irrisistable as the American ones apparently did. There was only one moment where I felt the truth behind the mask seeped out. The crashing, discordant chord that he pounded out on the piano spoke to the truth of the man but it was the merest glimpse before he got control of himself & reverted back to his self-imposed role as Mr Enigmatic & Reasonable Rogers.I did give this 5*s but that had more to do with loving the soundtrack (any film opening with Nick Drake can't be all bad) & the cinematography, which was beautiful. The scenes with Matthew Rhys in rabbit ears reminded me of the Pressberger & Powell films in the 40s & were the best part of the whole thing!Unfortunately not even that can offset the mawkish, saccharin nature of this venture, as a whole, particularly the final photo of Vogal en famille which nearly pushed me into diabetic shock! I think that this was a colossal waste of the talents of all involved, especially Hanks & Rhys, having to play characters so 2 dimensional they could have slid under any door.

Tom Hanks is perfect as the influential television childhood instructor, Fred Rogers in Marielle Heller's wonderful film.However, in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Fred Rogers is a supporting character, and Hanks the supporting actor. I understand Mr. Hanks' name draws audiences, and he has a solid record with two Oscars. Nonetheless, it would have been realistic for audiences' expectations, if the filmmakers billed Tom Hanks secondary to Matthew Rhys, the actual lead actor.Mr. Rhys portrays Lloyd Vogel, an award-winning magazine profiler and an emotionally bruised adult surviving a tarnished childhood. He endured relatively well as a capable professional, husband and new father. His recovery carries unhealed wounds in bitter resentment against his abandoning father (Chris Cooper). A man irresponsibly missing in action at the death of Vogel's beloved mother. The pages now turns when Vogel gets a surprise assignment from his editor, Ellen (Christine Lahti), to interview Mr. Rogers as a modern hero.Reluctant Vogel is given only 20 minutes to interview Fred Rogers on the studio set. The reporter asked him an important question distinguishing the two Rogers, character and real man. At this point, when Fred kindly averts the answer and targets Vogel's internal demons. We can see where this movie is already heading. And the film accomplishes it favorably, that is Lloyd's journey of finding inner peace with forgiveness. Thank goodness he has Mr. Rogers as a life coach, their friendship blossoms and extends to others. My admittance of how encouraging in watching Vogel and Rogers' interchange.A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is an easy movie to recommend. Its art in childhood aspiration and cinema healing is at a high standard without superfictional icing. Besides Hanks, the performances are excellent among all the principal cast. The movie based on a true story blends in the late 1990s past sensory using Mr. Roger's model tv town as continual set design in its narrative. But, if you want to learn more intimately, the keystone person, Fred Rogers, there might be felt an disappointing emptiness.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
559,jjrupp,An Empty Day In The Neighborhood,1,12 February 2020,"As someone who grew up watching Mr. Rogers I was Very Disappointed in the movie. The title and the promos are Very misleading because 90% of the movie wasn't even about 'My Neighbor'. Mr. Hanks played the character all wrong and he should've fired his vocal coach because he spoke way too fast. In fact when I closed my eyes I thought I was listening to Forrest Gump. It's a Sad Day In The Neighborhood when this Beautiful, One Of A Kind Human was so horribly ignored by a movie 'CLAIMING' to be about him. I am a published writer and reporter myself 'Id LOVE to make a movie 100% about this wonderful man. There's so many questions I would seek answers for UNLIKE this sad movie",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I don't get how you could hate this as it's more of a surreal take on what was already known and took it through the lens of a fictionalized version of actual events. The brilliant choice to start off like it's an actual episode, complete with the intro music and song, and using the original cameras from the show to really get the authentic feel actually served to make this movie feel perfect and not gimmicky as some might think.Now it does follow a different character instead of Fred all the time. But it felt more like a location shot for the show than a throughly removed part of the tale.The greatest part I enjoyed the most was the acid trip dream sequence when Lloyd passes out.One can enjoy both of these movies without being hyper critical of this one. There are a few story ideas they could have done better, but overall this movie is wonderful!",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
561,ryannhl1,A Very Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Indeed,10,8 September 2019,"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a beautiful feel-good film about Mr. Rogers and the effect he had and will always have on people. It tells the tale of his relationship with Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), an emotionally jaded reporter tasked to write a profile on him as one of America's heroes (based on the real life story of Tom Junod's relationship with Mr. Rogers).Tom Hanks absolutely shines as he transforms into the beloved children's show star in a role his career has been perhaps always leading to. Hanks embodies all that is Fred Rogers, from his delicate mannerism to beautifully authentic warmth with others. Hanks pulls at your heartstrings with every word uttered during the film's run.Tom Hanks, however, is not the only actor to be lauded for his performance, as co-stars Matthew Rhys (Lloyd Vogel) and Chris Cooper (Jerry Vogel) deliver outstanding ones in their own right. The father-son struggle presented in the film allows for each actor to flush out raw emotion that transcends with the audience. Rhys and Hanks too have this tremendous chemistry that has each actor radiating in the scenes they share.The film brings back many aspects of nostalgia for viewers of the original show as Hanks and company perfectly recreate iconic scenes and moments. The film also does an excellent job intercutting from the show's original 4:3 aspect ratio and 2 camera set up to modern film production. This allows for these scenes to have a unique presentation as we jump from Mr. Rogers' neighborhood to the film. Director Marielle Heller (Can You Ever Forgive Me? (2018)) and writing duo Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster work meticulously to bring Mr. Rogers' world to life, allowing for the film to feel authentic in each and every way.This film is about Mr. Rogers' impact on one person's life on its surface. However, looking slightly beyond unveils much more in that it is a look at the human condition and Mr. Rogers' exceptional understanding of it. It explains the importance people have in each other's lives and how much we depend on one another, something Mr. Rogers very much understood and exemplified in his life's work. Sometimes you need Mr. Rogers to explain it to you as he always finds a way to make it easy to understand and feel better about. The world could do with more Mr. Rogers and this film shows us just exactly why.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
562,daretha-952-264206,I'm split,7,13 December 2019,"Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers is wonderful! I could have watched him for hours. However, I don't understand why they based the movie on the Esquire magazine article, other than it was easier to base the movie on an already-written story than to come up with a new story themselves. That shouldn't have been too hard. It's Mr. Rogers, after all--there's probably a hundred potential storylines. Anyway, Lloyd and his family are uninspiring and don't have much to say; they're all kind of dismal characters. Yes, the tension between Lloyd and his dad is real and pretty emotional, and Mr. Rogers plays a vital role in the family's story, but for a movie this big I would have expected something more. The documentary was much better--more on point and more moving.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Although Mr. Rogers was shown in the kind light, the movie for me was missing the charm and magic element. I think this is due to the main character Lloyd Vogel being not very likeable.

The film managed to evoke a palpable sense of poignancy even in an English audience whose members do not have the protagonist as an indelible part of their childhood.

566,sjnahuysen,An uncomfortable and dull journey into nothingness.,3,15 February 2020,"I am going to go against the glowing reviews from predominantly North Americans and say that this movie was dull with little to no character development and, at times, downright creepy.I watched this movie through the lens of someone who did not grow up with Mr Rogers and I really knew nothing of him before watching this movie. I went to have that ""feel good"" experience, but unfortunately I left feeling a little disturbed.Mr Rogers came across as creepy and a groomer of young children.There are a few scenes where I just wished it would move on to something else.For example, his prolonged interaction with a child who appeared to be disabled, finishing in a hug and Mr Rogers awkwardly talking a photo of the little family for his private photo album. The photo-taking happened a few times throughout the film and that in itself was disturbing.Character development was poor and shallow. No matter how hard I tried, I just could not connect or identify with any of them.The character of Lloyd was indeed flawed and could have been the basis of a compelling storyline, but it didn't lift above his daddy issues and constant brooding.Apart from a good performance from the abundantly talented Tom Hanks, this film came across to me as the outing of one of America's most loved public figures.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

The Tom Hanks version, was more like someone talking and reacting to Nyquil. The cadence of Mr. Hanks, does not match the Mr. Rogers I grew up with, The second distraction, was the movie concentrated on the life of another man, that at first, had very little regard for Mr. Rogers. I understand that the overall storyline was, Mr. Rogers changed the lives of those he met, personally or through a television. A biography would have been an appropriate vehicle for the life of this simple but complex man. The move did have its high points, such as Fred Rogers getting into the character of his puppets, his humility and accessibility, even if it conflicted with the time table of his producers. Overall an OK movie, but the 2018 Won't You Be My Neighbor? was a much better film, that left the movie goers, in our theater teary eyed.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I have definite mixed feeling about it.On one hand Tom Hanks plays Mr Rogers brilliantly, the look, the mannerisms are all there. Every time he's on screen you are immediately sucked into the movie.On the other hand you have Lloyd Vogel, a journalist who the movie is really about, mostly concerning his friendship and transformation with the help of Mr Rogers. Unfortunately when his story was being told (which was the majority of the movie) the movie dragged.... a lot. I didn't really care for any of the characters on his side of the story and the family drama felt very manufactured.In the end it wasn't a bad movie, it was just one with a split personality with a majority of elements that I wasn't expecting. i.e. less Lloyd and more Mr. Rogers.

Fully capturing the persona of Mr. Rogers is nearly impossible, and is in no fault that of Hanks. It just hinders the story telling ability to go an extra step further that would have elevated the plot.

Lloyd Vogel seems like a really poor journalist; not really sure how he would have had a job at Esquire... I think the story itself, about how Mr. Rogers cares deeply about people and went out of his way to care for a journalist, is compelling. But this movie was tone-deaf.

Aside from nailing Rogers to a tee, the scene in the restaurant where Fred asks Lloyd to participate in the experiment of ""one minute of silence to remember those who loved you into existence., For me, with no shred of doubt, this was absolutely the most touchingly personal and powerful scene I have ever felt in cinema. And the writer, director and Hanks knew full well the power of that moment along with every actor and crew taking part. I have a sense that scene may have been perfect on the first take because it was so real and deeply evocative. Of course I'm willing, however I would be surprised to be wrong.

604,opalpika1328,An Amazing and Beautiful Movie!,10,26 April 2020,"Tom Hanks did well at playing the part of Mister Rogers. Sure, this wasn't solely about Mister Rogers, and more about a journalist named Lloyd Vogel, who was based on the real journalist who got inspired by Mister Rogers, Tom Junod, but it still was a great movie. Lloyd was a man who had a tough life and had a not so good relationship with his father, especially from what he has done in the past. He also wasn't good at expressing his feelings. He believed that the guy he was assigned to interview, Mister Rogers, was just playing an act of this perfect person on a TV show aimed at children. He later found out that he was wrong about him, that even Mister Rogers had struggles in his life, but he dealt with them in ways that wouldn't hurt himself or others, and that he wasn't trying to act like or be a ""perfect person"". Lloyd found it hard to forgive his father, but after spending more and more time with Mister Rogers, he became a better person to his family, and forgiven his father, who was dying. His article on Esquire magazine about Mister Rogers was a success as well. Even though it was mainly about Lloyd (again who was based on Tom Junod) than it was about Mister Rogers, it had elements in certain parts that seemed exactly like the Mister Rogers TV show, from the intro, to showing how a magazine was made, and even to that famous ending!
All in all, it is a great feel good movie that deals with a lot of life problems, from how family relationships can be and how hard it can be to forgive someone that may have done something bad, and how it can be to deal with those problems better without resorting to hurting someone or yourself.
For more on Mister Rogers, ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"" tells more on the life of Mister Rogers, and ""Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood"", is a spinoff of ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" but still has the same feelings and messages that Mister Rogers has shown on his TV show that everyone, young and old, can enjoy.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

The film begins with the iconic tinkling on piano keys of the Mister Rogers' Neighborhood theme song, underscoring the miniature city set that was a key set component on the beloved children's television show. The fictional character of Junord is known as Lloyd Vogel in the movie, is cynical, an award-winning journalist for Esquire Magazine. Finding it difficult to believe that Rogers is the ""nicest man on earth."" Lloyd sets out to discredit him. In the process, he is transformed personally and professionally. Through his interactions with Rogers, who initiated the interview, Vogel gains valuable lessons in kindness, decency, and forgiveness. The setting for the movie brings a sense of nostalgia for the viewer that watched the original show. Heartwarming and passionate, the most prevalent theme is that of forgiveness and managing our emotions. Life is hard; children and adults alike struggle with emotions. Rogers remains steadfast in his mission to help people, especially children dealing with complicated feelings. Vogel, who harbors lifelong resentments, is confronted repeatedly by Rogers as to his relationship with his father. In Rogers' apartment living room, Rogers introduces Vogel to his puppets, attempting to penetrate Vogel's emotional armor regarding his feelings.Vogel defensively reacts by asking the question repeatedly to Rogers, ""how do you deal with the burden of fans telling you their problems every day""? Vogel does not believe Rogers can be as kind and upbeat constantly without some source or outlet for dealing with his stress. The screenplay, by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, is inspired by the Esquire magazine piece by Tom Junod, Can you say...Hero? Beautifully written and brilliantly cast with Hanks and Rhys as Rogers and Vogel. Rogers remains steadfast and constant in showing kindness and empathy towards Vogel. He leads Vogel on a journey of loving broken people and helps him manage his anger and resentment, which reaps the peace of acceptance and forgiveness. The need for affirming films sharing the same message of kindness and forgiveness is evident in recent movies. Most notably for me is the 2017 children's film, Coco. The message of this film is similar to A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, one of forgiveness and just showing up for people. Showing up for broken people and making a difference was the driving force in Mister Rogers Neighborhood series and his mantra.Two fascinating techniques used in the filming and editing of this film were the usage of the miniature cities and the slow pace of the dialogue. The film's transitions between New York and Pittsburg are creatively used through the elaborate replica of Mister Rogers' set and actual buildings and cities relevant to the story. Additionally, the dialogue was slow and deliberate throughout the movie. The intended purpose was to communicate to adults the same as Mister Rogers would speak to children. Interestingly this annoyed his staff, but the admiration for him was also evident. At times, they found humor in his slow, deliberate actions.I feel the director and producer did an excellent job of honoring the authenticity of who Mister Rogers was. Mister Rogers' message of forgiveness and the importance of managing your feelings is eloquently told and exhibited through Rogers' friendship with Vogel and Vogel's reconciliation with his father. You cannot help but be changed or inspired to make a difference and show a little kindness after watching this movie.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
611,IrishxPrincess,A feel of nostalgia as we explore Mr. Rogers,10,28 December 2019,"This was a fascinating look into the man who made so many children happy. Fred Rogers created a space on television for children to learn valuable lessons. Many people in that theater were remembering the lessons taught to us. The most powerful moment in this movie was 60 seconds and something that will quite possibly stay with the viewers for a long time to come. Clearly I grew up watching and loving Mr. Rogers but I have to say I wasn't expecting to like it. Mr. Rogers is someone who I feel you can't mimic and he is a hero who should always be who he is. However, Tom Hanks was the perfect Mr. Rogers. Perfect it was honestly like watching the real Mr. Rogers. The entire cast was fantastic and I spent several moments of the movie crying because it reminded me of how important it is to be kind. It truly was a beautiful day in this neighborhood and theater.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
612,sbstorm11,"Worth seeing once, sort of",6,16 December 2019,"Tom Hanks is fantastic as Fred Rogers, but this movie really centered on Lloyd Vogel, a journalist who interviews Mr. Rogers for an Esquire magazine article. Lloyd has a fractured relationship with his father Jerry. Dad cheated on Mom and then deserted Jerry and his sister Lorraine when they were kids. I could have done without this part of the story, or at least the amount of emphasis placed on it. Early on in the movie, Lorraine gets married and Lloyd and his wife attend the wedding, only to find Jerry is there. Lloyd is not happy, and it seems like he's being criticized for not forgiving Jerry right away. He learns forgiveness from Mr. Rogers. As much as I enjoyed certain scenes, and the use of dioramas like the ones used in Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, the emphasis on Lloyd and how he had to become a better person bothered me. I'm glad I saw it, mainly due to the acting and music, but I wouldn't want to see it again.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
613,doozdr,"Good movie, but could've used more editing",7,27 June 2020,"I enjoyed much of this movie, but became antsy toward the end. It was just too long. I'm a huge fan of the real Mr. Rogers, having discovered his show as a teenager (and making fun of it) and loving it while watching with my own children years later.Hanks did a good job capturing Rogers mannerisms and speech patterns, but I must admit at times I heard a bit of Forest Gump coming from his mouth...and Woody from Toy story.I'm not sure how the very few interactions between Mr. Rogers and Vogel would've changed the reporter's outlook on family, sadness and anger so quickly, but I suspended disbelief and reasoned the dialogue between the two was perhaps deeper in real life than what the script provided.I caught myself smiling through much of this movie and tears threatened to fall in parts of it. So, though It's A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood has faults, I still recommend it if you love Mr. Rogers.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

615,blasthoff36,Surprised and enjoyed! Fine acting by main characters!!,9,19 January 2020,"This was more about the Fred Rogers I knew from his book written for parents. It is a story of adult learning essentially the same lesson Mr Rogers communicates to children. It's universal knowledge just a little more complicated to get across. A wonderful and enjoyable story!!

616,william-123-677829,Mr. Rogers....I mean Tom Hanks,9,30 December 2019,"Was not ready for this movie, okay I knew it was going to be an emotional one, but not the amount of water work that ensued. We all grew up watching Mr. Rogers, and I was very skeptical that anyone could pull it off, but if anyone who would even come close it would be Tom Hanks. At the start it was just weird, it wasn't Fred Rogers we all know and adored growing up, but as scene after scene Mr. Rogers came to life again on the screen in front of me, and a bit of my childhood was relived, and yet so much more as now Mr. Rogers was talking to me as an grown up, and that even though we are grown ups It's okay to feel whatever it is that we feel. It was nearly impossible not to sing along at the end of the movie when Mr. Rogers... I mean Tom Hanks started to sing.....""It's such a good feeling,
To know you're alive
It's such a happy feeling
You're growing inside...",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
617,jkohlerrn,Marvelous!,10,6 December 2019,"The audience in this small town theater was mostly middle aged people on the Monday after Thanksgiving. We waited through the many ads and previews and when the tiny model town familiar to us all came on screen you could hear all of us chuckle....it was exactly as we remembered it! Tom Hanks portrayed Fred Rodgers so well we thought Mr. Rodgers was back with us. The story, though, was one we didn't know. We were kids when it happened. But, it impacted us all now as adults, and we cried. Make no mistake, we cried tears of sorrow and tears of pride. It was pride in a man who was SO kind, so gentle and so important to all of us.
This movie was lovely. Well acted, well told, and if not seen, you will be lose out on the gift that was Mr. Rodgers.
Thank you, Mr. Hanks, for bringing him back to us.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
618,musedbyme,Beautifully done movie about an icon I loved,9,29 December 2019,This is a beautiful movie about a very good and kind man who stayed present in the moment with whoever he was with and who reaped the benefits of kindness in return. I loved Mr. Rogers as a girl and greatly enjoyed this movie too. The storyline was compelling and the acting wonderful. It was fun to see the puppets and a little behind the set too.,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
619,intlvelvet,A Simply Phenomenal Film. Defies Characterization; A Study in the Power of Empathy,10,21 February 2020,"I cannot write an objective review about technique, story or the normal ways I/we evaluate movies. I cannot be objective about something that moved me so personally. There was something almost magical about Mr. Rogers for children, and this movie did a great job in conveying how that really transcended childhood and that his practice of deep, intentional empathy catalyzed a transformative change in an man, who was deeply wounded in childhood. We as children, understand that Mr. Rogers is what we should expect of humanity, but we learn in adulthood that type of caring is, in fact, very rare. Do yourself a huge favor and see this; I cried through most of it, out of recognition, discovery, shared pain, and love for the people I fortunate enough to have known in my life who reminded me in some small way of Fred Rogers. Blessings upon him.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

622,michaeldoverkamp-666-325448,Terrible and highly disappointing,1,1 December 2019,"So here's why I didn't like the Mr. Roger's movie
1) I was under the impression the movie was about Mr Rogers and it really wasn't 2) I found it emotionless. I was so bored and the triggers that dramas usually create were non-existent 3) It went slow and was predictable 4) the film is almost 100% fictionalI didn't like it all. I'd give it a 0 if I could.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
623,purplenanny777,Brought me back to my childhood.,10,5 April 2020,"I absolutely loved it! I couldn't stop crying throughout the movie. Tom brought me back to my youth when life was simple and innocent. The first scene released the floodgates of memories, and I had to sing along with Tom at the end, while tears rolled down my cheeks. I was hesitant to rent this movie because I felt no one could play Fred Rogers, but I was so wrong! As usual Tom nailed it!",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
624,manjukandula,VERY BORING!,1,24 November 2019,"I knew that the film was more about the journalist, and I grew up watching Mr Roger's Neighborhood, but this movie was incredibly boring. One of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I found myself looking at my watch after the first hour hoping that the movie would be over. It was too slow paced. Horrible, horrible movie!",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
625,calmfran,"""A Journalist Journey, The Lloyd Vogel Story""",5,23 November 2019,"If you are a fan of Tom Hanks and you watched the trailers you will be surprised to discover that Tom Hanks is in the movie less the 15 percent. If you are a fan of Mister Roger's Neighborhood or Fred Rogers the man you will discover that you know less of him and his show then you knew before you watched this movie. You are not paying to see Tom Hanks you are paying to see other actors, their storylines, some surrealism, and Mister Rodgers' brand protection. It should be called, ""A Journalist Journey, The Lloyd Vogel Story.""
In Frances McDormand Oscar's speech, two words that she said comes to mind when you watch this movie, ""Inclusion Rider.""If you grew up in Pittsburg or another city watching Mr. Rodger's Neighborhood and you were that little Asian, Hispanic, Black, Native American, or a minority kid and watched the show you could tell that someone or something we're missing in Mister Roger's Neighborhood. Unlike Mister Rodgers' Neighborhood the show, the movie with Tom Hanks has a very diverse cast and paints a very delightful picture of his neighborhood as if it had impacted a group of people that were often omitted from the Nielsen ratings. The unique thing about television is that you can review the old episodes and enjoy them for what they were, not for what we want them to be.Fred Rogers created the show, the music, was the star, directed, produced, and wrote the show. When you watch the movie you get the feeling that they are protecting the ""Fred Rogers"" brand. In the movie, when Mr. Rogers spoke, he always had something profound and enlightening to say and if you were to meet him you would have had a spiritual or magical experience. Unfortunately, you will not gain any information about Fred Rogers's life, the friendship between him and the journalist, or the process of creating and maintaining the show. It is about a troubled journalist finding inspiration in his life to complete his article.If you are a fan of Lloyd Vogel or the actor Matthew Rhys then this is the movie for you.Some movie goers will tell you that you should have researched and read about the real journalist, his article about Mister Rodgers', or watched the documentary movie before see this movie as a prerequisite in order to understand, appreciate, and justify the movie greatness. If that is what you did before you watched ""Captain Phillips,"" ""Sully,"" ""Apollo 13,"" The Post,"" "" Catch Me If Can,"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" then this is movie for you and enjoy.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
626,leesethrogers,Not Very Good,2,23 January 2020,I didn't think this was a very good movie. It wasn't the epic biopic I expected. If this wins any awards I will be disappointed. They should have made a traditional biopic. This seemed like a movie about Mister Rogers interaction with one journalist. The movie was about the journalist problems. This wasn't a Mister Rogers Biopic. I hope the Joker sweeps. Tom Hanks has done better an award for this would be insulting.,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Both Tom, who plays Fred Rogers, and Matthew Rhys, playing Lloyd Vogel, immerse us in a moving film, full of emotion and empathy. I honestly did not know about Fred Rogers and his TV show, since I was born in Argentina and in the past the world was not as connected as it is today, but both he, and his tv show and the story that unfolds between the protagonists, has moved me and encouraged to write these lines.

I as many other people remembered watching Mr. Rogers growing up and was excited for the movie. The first thing I'd say is if you're expecting a Bio Pic on Mr. Rodgers this is not that movie. This movie is less a movie about Mr. Rodgers and more a movie for the broken using Mr. Rodgers' message. The cuts and shots in the movie were extremely well done, some of my favorites scenes were the Hall way symmetry scene with Lloyd slightly off center, when Mr. Rodgers and Lloyd disappear in the crowd of NYC, and Lloyd and his wife walking into the light as they were symbolic scenes used as metaphors for the movie.
All together it was a solid and beautifully crafted movie using the light hearted and loving message of Mr. Rodgers to cover a dark message that many people need in this day and age.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
632,jobysaad,an important message,10,22 March 2020,"I loved this movie. It was not what I expected. What Mr Rogers did, so eloquently, and what Tom Hanks did... so many important messages.

I have to say, I was not disappointed. In fact, pretty soon, I kind of forgot that he was not Fred Rogers himself, because of how authentically he played the role. I bet Tom really loved Mr. Rogers, and I bet Tom cares about people in a way similar to Fred. Anyway, this movie made me reflect about myself and my relationships with my family, which are the most important relationships we can build in this life. I believe this movie is so important, and everyone should watch this, whether they are alone, or with their family. Either way, I think it will bring tears. I know it brought tears to my eyes, because I can relate to the journalist, who was cynical, but was actually a good person, who just needed forgiveness and compassion from his wife, and who needed to forgive and show compassion to his father.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

Mostly still human, and the film reminds this aspect of being special, but still ordinary and vulnerable!

I truly believe he misspent his effort in under-playing the role, and it came across as more of a caricature than a portrayal. And Hanks is way too talented for that.
Perhaps it's just me, but I think Jim Parsons might have been perfect for the part.
Having said that, it was a wonderful story of forgiveness and redemption, and the role Rogers saw for himself in life as a peacemaker.
The ending was particularly poignant as it made allusion to Rogers' own health issues, and as that last scene fades into a silhouette of Rogers at the piano, how he processes through with a method that he alluded to earlier in the film. Powerful imagery.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood

I think that Tom did a wonderful job in his role and so did everyone else. The casting in this was wonderful.Please do not get me wrong! I don't think that Tom Hanks looks like Fred Rogers but honestly that is not the point at all.
You could find someone who looks EXACTLY the same as the person you wish to portray, yet if their soul is the absolute opposite and they can not act that will come across. I think Tom did a wonderful job as Fred.The actors in this movie, that would be ALL of the actors put their souls in their works. I don't know about others but I could feel that. To me they did wonderfully.Anyone who feels differently has every right to but please do not doubt the soul each person put into their work.

Maybe with a slicker marketing campaign, a more exciting story, or a more familiar character?
Even more occasionally we go to see the film that might have slipped by. For me today was one of those times. And what an incredible film this is. I'm British, so not familiar with the character of Mr Rogers at all, but despite the poster the film wasn't really about him at all, but about the hardened, angry and fractured reporter sent to interview him. And about life and how precious it is. How precious each of us is. Mr Rodgers provides the opportunity and the insight for the central character to grow and work through his trauma. So many themes tackled in here without it being preachy or sugar coated. Just honesty and kindness. The world needs more films like this and more Mr Rogers.",A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
