0,TheLittleSongbird,Derails very quickly,3,31 October 2016,"The book is a terrific and engrossing read, with a lot of tension and suspense, a clear timeline and while the characters are unpleasant you understand why they are.In comparison 'The Girl on the Train' is down there among the most underwhelming book-to-film adaptations, with everything that made the book so good being completely lost in translation in the film. However it also is a failure on its own terms as an overall film, one doesn't even need to have read the book or have knowledge of it to still consider 'The Girl on the Train' a disappointment. If anybody likes the film, that's absolutely fine and good for them, as a huge mystery-thriller fan this was one of the year's biggest letdowns while not quite being bad enough to be one of the year's worst.Comparisons to 'Gone Girl', which has a similar tone and a couple of similar themes, and almost universally negatively is understandable and inevitable. Will try and keep the comparison brief, to me 'Gone Girl' is the vastly superior film, actually being a good, no great, film. It isn't perfect, faltering at the end with a conclusion that feels abrupt and illogical, but it's better made and directed (the direction was one of the best things about that film, while the direction here dooms this film), the ""Cool Girl"" monologue alone is much better than any of the dialogue in this film, that had tension, suspense, emotion and delicious black but subtle humour and Rosamund Pike's performance is one of that year's best performances and in the top end of the best Oscar-nominated performances of this decade.What saves 'The Girl on the Train' from crashing and burning completely is the acting, which is terrific on the whole. The women do fare better than the men, though the men, with Justin Theroux being the most believable, are no slouches either. Emily Blunt's lead performance in particular is sensational. The exceptions though are Rebecca Ferguson, who looks lost with a character completely stripped of what made her interesting before, and Edgar Ramirez who comes over as annoying. Danny Elfman's score is one of his more understated and memorable ones in recent years, not his best work by any stretch but tonally it fits very well, being soothing yet unsettling.However, Tate Taylor as director is clearly ill at ease with the dark material, because throughout it's stiff, indifferent and far too much of one mood. The story is a complete mess, with no tension or suspense whatsoever and plot twists that are introduced abruptly and are executed confusingly, even incomprehensibly, due to the lack of a clear time line and with little surprises. The pace really drags on constantly so the film is constantly as dull as dishwater and there is an overload of sex scenes that are also tasteless as well as being melodramatic with the subtlety of an axe. In the end, one doesn't care how it ends and the ending or the revelation of the culprit are not done particularly well. The culprit's identity is not that shocking and is revealed too early, and then the film meanders on for another half an hour when the film could easily have ended at the revelation.Another huge let-down is the very soap-opera-ish, underwritten and very half-baked script, that doesn't do anything to develop the characters, who are nasty without explanation or reason to be so it makes them empty and very difficult to relate to their situations. The production design is good but wasted by the very made for TV way the film is shot and edited. Particularly bad is the haphazard editing.Overall, doesn't completely crash and burn due to the acting (especially Blunt) and the score but derails very quickly and is a train-wreck on the whole. 3/10 Bethany Cox",The Girl on the Train
1,Leofwine_draca,What's all the fuss about?,3,11 July 2017,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is another example of a massively popular movie that's been generally raved about by critics and viewers alike, but a film that leaves me cold. I really can't see what all the fuss is about for a movie like this. The story is about a bunch of cold, unlikeable characters and it seems to be a case of who does what (or did what) to whom. Attempts at mystery and atmosphere fall flat and the whole thing becomes convoluted about 20 minutes in, piling on the flashbacks and reveals but utterly failing to entertain at the same time. I loved Emily Blunt in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA but she really feels out of her depth in more meaty fare, failing in LOOPER and now this. I don't care if she's had all her make-up scraped off and cries and swears a lot, this isn't my definition of good acting.",The Girl on the Train
2,SnoopyStyle,disjointed,5,27 August 2017,"Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) rides the train passing her former married life in her beautiful house. Her former neighbor Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) goes missing and police detective Riley (Allison Janney) interrogates her. She is a drunk haunted by her former life. Her ex-husband Tom Watson (Justin Theroux) lives in her former house with his new wife Anna Watson (Rebecca Ferguson) and baby. Her former neighbor Megan lives with her husband Scott (Luke Evans). She uncovers devastating lost memories from her life with Tom.The flow is disjointed and the slow reveal leaves me bored. There is a great cast here but it only gets compelling during the harrowing climax. Overall, it plays as a muddled melodrama that doesn't grab me until the end. It needs some more danger in the present time to enliven the drama but it is more like a bunch of boring flashbacks.",The Girl on the Train
3,Hitchcoc,Not Nearly as Embracing,6,21 October 2016,"I do occasionally read something from the best-seller lists. This one intrigued me because of the amount of time it sat at number one. After finally reading it, I felt pretty fulfilled. It is a true page turner, and the way it is put together works quite well. The characters are at the center, but in this one there seems to be only a single one given any depth. Emily Blunt's Rachel is a scattergun of craziness and chemical abuse. Having familiarity with the book and already knowing what would happen, she became my focus. The portrayal is quite good and she is a wonderful actress. That said, the rest is a kind of cardboard piece with people moving around her to ""advance"" the plot. None of them are really that interesting. The psychiatrist is played with little verve. Allison Janney's police officer, who is pivotal in the book, could have been anyone. This was disappointing because I believe her to be quite a good performer (I think of ""The West Wing""). There is really little suspense leading up to a made-for-TV conclusion. I have little knowledge of the art of screen writing, but other than watching things play out, I left with very little to talk about. Again, it's frequently unfair to compare a book to a movie, but this book was fuel for a much better film.",The Girl on the Train
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Not always convincing, but ultimately rewarding",6,17 November 2016,"""The Girl on the Train"" is a 110-movie from the United States, so in English language, and one of the most talked about new releases these days. This one is based on a novel by Paula Hawkins and the director is Tate Taylor, mostly known for the Oscar-winning ""The Help"" so far. And as he dealt with inequality back then, the focus here is on alcoholism as Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt plays a young woman suffering from that addiction. But is it really about this? Because, as the ending reveals, this disease is really just means to telling a much deeper, much darker story that may have directly to do with the main character's problem. In my opinion, the heart and soul of the film is really the crime story. After the first 30-45 minutes or so, it is all about the film being a murder thriller and we (the audience) wonder if Blunt's character really became a murderer that night. Or was it the victim's man? Was it the psychiatrist? Or maybe somebody else even? I will not tell any spoilers. In the center of it all is serial Emmy winner Allison Janney playing the cop who investigates the killing. However, she also does not have that many or great scenes as eventually, they wanted to make the film about Blunt's character and nobody else at the center of it. As a consequence, even a very gifted actor like Edgar Ramirez was pretty much wasted here. Same goes for Lisa Kudrow, who plays a crucial role in Blunt's character finding the truth, but she herself has almost nothing to work with and they could have done so much more with Kudrow, who is a great actress.So all in all, it comes down to the crime plot and Blunt's performance that will certainly gain her some awards attention in the coming months. And even with the final revelation about her alcoholism and the things she has(n't) done because of it, it is never really a deep study on the subject of this terrible addiction. But it does not need to be either to make the film work for the most part. If you are looking for a similar, yet superior, film with really major focus on the subject or alcoholism, I suggest you go for Mary Elizabeth Winstead in ""Smashed"". Back to this one here: The last 20-30 minutes are definitely the highlight. But even before that, the film works well for the most part, even if there are some scenes that weren't really convincing. But this also refers to the ending I guess. Ferguson's character's last scene with the killer was admittedly a bit ridiculous and also did not make a lot of sense compared to her behavior towards him since the beginning of the film. So yeah, it is not a perfect film by any means, but 2 hours of solid entertainment and an okay addition to Taylor's and Blunt's body of work overall. The tone, plot and atmosphere reminded me a bit of ""Gone Girl"". I recommend the watch.",The Girl on the Train
5,Prismark10,This train is empty,5,18 January 2017,"The film adaptation of The Girl On The Train relocates the action from London to the New York suburbs but also makes the characters paper thin and mystery anodyne.Rachel is a lonely inebriated publicist who once had it all and blew it away. On her daily commute she looks out of the train on to the suburban houses and on to the idyllic lives of others such as young Megan and her hunky husband but a few doors away there is Anna, her young baby and her husband Tom. However Tom used to be married to Rachel.Megan was Tom and Anna's nanny and one day she disappears. Rachel thinks she saw something from the train and then intrudes on these lives. However Rachel ravaged with booze and behavioural problems is an unreliable narrator. Her memories are hazy and maybe she may even had been present when Megan disappeared.Emily Blunt does her best with the material as Rachel. With her English accent she already comes across as an outsider. The adaptation is reduced to making use of non linear flashbacks to stretch out the material because when you really look at the film and the characters the suspect is so easy to pinpoint. The eventual reveal has little surprise.",The Girl on the Train
6,claudio_carvalho,"A Thriller with Great Potential and Cast, Wasted by a Poor Screenplay and Inadequate Direction",5,31 December 2016,"The divorcée Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) commutes every day to New York by train and watches the old house where she lived with her husband Tom Watson (Justin Theroux) through the window. Rachel is an alcoholic and sterile woman that frequently has blackouts and shares an apartment with her friend Cathy (Lura Prepon). Tom is married with Anna Boyd (Rebecca Ferguson) with the baby Evie. Their babysitter is Megan Hipwell that lives with her husband Scott (Luke Evans) in the same neighborhood in the suburb. Rachel admires Megan and Scott since she believes they are the perfect couple. However Megan is a promiscuous woman that has affairs with many men including her psychiatrist Dr. Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez). When Rachel sees Megan kissing another man on the balcony of her house, she decides to have a conversation with Megan after drinking in a bar. However she has a blackout and awakens with bruises in her apartment. Soon she learns that Megan is missing and Detective Riley (Allison Janney) that is in charge of the investigation visits Rachel to interrogate her since the neighbors had seen an alcoholic woman wandering in the area. However Rachel does not recall what she did that night. Rachel decides to investigate the case and has dreadful discoveries about her life and Tom. Who might be the killer?""The Girl on the Train"" is a thriller with a good story but terrible screenplay. The characters are not well-developed and despite the great performance of the wonderful Emily Blunt, her character Rachel Watson is a complete mess. Megan and Scott Hipwell, Anna and Tom Watson, and Dr. Kamal Abdic are also one-dimensional characters. The non-linear screenplay could be better and better, but instead of suspense and tension, gives the sensation of a soap-opera. In the end, ""The Girl on the Train"" is a film with great potential and cast but wasted by a poor screenplay and inadequate direction. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""A Garota no Trem"" (""The Girl on the Train"")",The Girl on the Train
7,nogodnomasters,Do you need a drink?,9,11 September 2017,"The film opens introducing three characters.Rachel (Emily Blunt) is the title character. She is fascinated by the people who live in #15 Beckett as she rides by in the train, spying on their lives. She is also fascinated by the contents of a bottle in an unhealthy way. We know she lived at #13 Beckett. She suffers from blackouts and can't remember what she did while intoxicated.Megan (Haley Bennett) is introduced second. She is talking to her psychologist (Edgar Ramírez) and lets us know she is a free spirit living with Scott (Luke Evans). She sleeps around and despises children. She lives at #15 and is the nanny for Anna.Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) is Tom's (Justin Theroux) wife with a new baby. They live at #13. Megan has just given Anna her to-day notice in she is leaving today.Rachel is a bit of a stalker. She couldn't have a baby with Tom. Anna lives in her home with her husband, feeding a baby on the same table she had done the nasty with her husband. It eats at her.When a missing person happens, the suspect wheel starts to spin and Rachel decides to play detective, not ruling herself out.This is an interesting if not unusual mystery. The performances were stellar, even the extras such as Lisa Kudrow, Laura Prepon, and Allison Janney. You don't get cheated. I liked it more than ""Gone Girl.""

8,kosmasp,Travelling,8,26 April 2017,"Sometimes you drift off and don't remember how you got where you are. Now imagine that happening quite often to you. Now also imagine weird things happening during your blackouts. Your voyage would not seem that innocent anymore now would it? Also you would have quite a few problems you would have to deal with.The cast is amazing in this one. Especially the female talent at hand is mesmerizing with very powerful performances. And I like where they take it if you'll excuse the pun. The suspense is really high and I was really into the whole story. When you mean well, but kind of have a touch to make things worse ... It's a thriller alright",The Girl on the Train
9,Sleepin_Dragon,Award for Emily? Should be....,9,15 October 2016,"The first point I'm going to make is that this film is outstanding, prior to seeing it, people made the point that it's very similar to Gone Girl, I agree to z minor extent, but in my opinion this is the better film. The story is wonderfully clever, how many of us haven't sat on a train, looked out and people and wondered how different our lives would have been, had we made different choices. The way the story unfolds is loaded with intrigue, you keep asking questions in your mind, all the way through to the revelation at the end. I always knew Emily Blunt was a class act, I just had no idea she was THIS good, she produced an utterly incredible performance as the tormented Rachel, it will be an outrage if awards don't follow for her. Justin Theroux, Luke Evans, to name just a few are also brilliant.I'm so glad the mystery genre is alive and well, and hitting the big screen. If you love a mystery, my advice is please go and see this movie. I utterly lived it. 9/10",The Girl on the Train
10,classicsoncall,"""I don't think you're helping anybody.""",8,18 April 2017,"I'm surprised at the relatively low rating for the picture and the visceral reaction of some of the negative reviewers. I thought this was a tightly scripted story with a plot that keeps one guessing as to the underlying motivations of it's principals. The initial treatment of Emily Blunt's character gives one the impression that mental illness may be involved along with the frequent tipping of the bottle. As the story progresses, details emerge that turn the story into a murder mystery with the attendant pointing of fingers at suspects both likely and unlikely. When the slime-ball Tom (Justin Theroux) got what he deserved from an enlightened Rachel (Blunt), it was a stand up and cheer moment, made even better by wife Anna's (Rebecca Ferguson) reenactment of the scene in ""The Godfather"" when Sonny Corleone had to get that one last kick into his brother-in-law's side. Classic, and pretty much the way I'll remember this movie whenever I hear it mentioned.",The Girl on the Train
11,jboothmillard,The Girl on the Train,5,27 October 2016,"The trailer for this film, based on the best-selling novel, certainly looked like it could be good, critics were comparing it to brilliant Gone Girl, so I went to see what I'd make of it, directed by Tate Taylor (The Help, Get on Up). Basically Rachel Watson (BAFTA nominated Emily Blunt) is an alcoholic, and divorced her husband Tom (Justin Theroux) after catching him cheating with their real estate agent Anna Boyd (Rebecca Ferguson). During their marriage, she was prone to alcohol-induced blackouts, during which she engaged in self- destructive behaviour, only later learning from Tom, she attributes this, and her being unable to have children, as ending their marriage. Rachel shares an apartment with her friend Cathy (Laura Prepon), and spends her time travelling on a train, with no real destination or purpose, and often stalking Tom, Anna and their newborn daughter Evie. During her trips she becomes fascinated with Tom's neighbours, young couple Scott (Luke Evans) and Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett), who look like they have a perfect life and marriage, in fact Scott is aggressive and controlling, while Megan is detached and being unfaithful, having affairs with many men, including her psychiatrist Dr. Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez). While passing on the train one day, Rachel spots Megan kissing Abdic on her balcony and is infuriated, she has a drinking binge, she plans to confront Megan, but blacks out and wakes hours later at her apartment with an injury, she then finds out Megan is missing, presumed dead, Detective Sergeant Riley (Allison Janney) questions her, suspecting Rachel may be involved due to her recent erratic behaviour. Rachel pretends to be a friend of Megan's to approach Scott, and tell him about Megan's affair, he identifies Abdic as Megan's lover, believing he is behind her disappearance Rachel makes an appointment with him to talk about her troubled marriage to Tom, including an incident at an office party where she lashed out and aggravated Martha (Lisa Kudrow), Tom's boss's wife, and got him fired. Rachel recognises a commuter (Darren Goldstein) from train journeys, he reveals he followed her the night Megan disappeared, he found Rachel beaten by an unseen figure, she aggressively declined his help, Rachel returns to the tunnel she was in on the night and recalls seeing Megan with Tom. Meanwhile Anna becomes suspicious of Tom after Sgt. Riley suggests him keeping in touch with her is encouraging Rachel's behaviour, Anna in the process of trying to hack into Tom's computer finds a secret phone with several messages to another woman he is having an affair with, this is verified as being Megan. The body of Megan is found, forensics reveal she was pregnant, but the child was not Scott's or Abdic's, Scott becomes a suspect, he confronts Rachel, believing she is conspiring against him, in the process he reveals he assaulted Megan before her death. Rachel runs into Martha and apologises for her behaviour at the office party, but discovers she did not lash out or get Tom fired, Tom was in fact fired for having sexual relations with numerous co- workers, Tom planted these false memories in Rachel's head, to account for his own abusive behaviour. Anna tells authorities about Tom's calls to Megan, who were having an affair, Rachel realises Megan was pregnant with Tom's baby, Abdic confirms she misinterpreted what she saw on the balcony. Rachel caught Tom meeting with Megan, and shouted at her, mistaking her for Anna, Tom bat Rachel before returning to Megan, who wanted to keep the child, realising this would expose his affair Tom murdered Megan in the woods. Rachel goes to warn Anna, but she already knows, Tom arrives and confronts them, he argues with Anna, while Rachel steals a corkscrew and steps out to call the police, Tom catches up to her and tries to strangle her, Anna watches from the window, Rachel stabs Tom in the neck with the corkscrew, he is not dead, Anna comes out and pushes the corkscrew deeper into Tom's neck to kill him. Rachel and Anna come to an understanding and separately confirm to the police that Tom was killed by Rachel in self-defence, after he revealed he killed Megan, a year later Rachel is sober and has found a new job, she does still commute on the train, but sits the opposite side of the carriage in a different car, to leave her past in the neighbourhood in the past. Blunt gives a fantastic performance as the alcoholic anti-heroine divorcée getting swept into a missing person case, Bennett (who you could mistake for Jennifer Lawrence) is good as the beautiful woman who suffers the consequences of being ""the other woman"", Evans is okay as the missing woman's husband, and Theroux is suitably suspicious. The story certainly keeps you guessing where it is going next, with the leading female character of the title having her own mental issues you question what is real and what is not, and how involved in the murder she really is, it may dip a little bit in places, but there are a good number of plot twists and scenes that get your attention, including the glimpses from each character's point of view, overall it is an interesting mystery thriller. Worth watching!",The Girl on the Train
12,Tweekums,A gripping psychological thriller with plenty of twists,9,28 March 2018,"This psychological thriller opens with Rachel, a commuter on a train into New York, looking out of the window. As they pass through the area where she used to live with her ex-husband, Tom, she looks at the house two doors away. She observes a woman, Megan, standing on the porch. She doesn't know anything about the woman but in her mind she imagines what her life might be like. In reality Megan was working as a nanny for Rachel's ex and his wife Anna until recently. Then one day Rachel sees Megan with a man who isn't her husband and is infuriated as it reminds her of how her marriage ended. She decides to get off the train at that station and as she does so she confronts a woman in a tunnel... the next thing she knows she is waking up at home covered in blood. It turns out Rachel is an alcoholic who is prone to blackouts and the day she got off the train was the last time anybody saw Megan. Rachel approaches Megan's husband Scott and, from photographs, identifies her psychiatrist as the man she saw Megan with. What follows is an investigation into what happened to Megan; there are many possibilities and Rachel is not the most reliable of witnesses; so much so that she doesn't even know if she was somehow involved in whatever happened.When I started watching this I was expecting to be reminded of 'Rear Window' but as the story played out the film this reminded me of most was 'Gone Girl'. Having an unreliable main character meant that until the end it is hard to guess exactly what happened to Megan and who was involved. This keeps things very tense right until the end. Through a series of flashbacks we learn more about Rachel's past as well as details of Megan's past. Emily Blunt does a really fine job as Rachel; it is hard not to sympathise with her character even when there is the possibility that she may have done something bad. There is fine support, most notably, from Haley Bennett, Rebecca Ferguson, Justin Theroux and Luke Evans as Megan, Anna, Tom and Scott. There are plenty of good twists, especially towards the end leading up to a finale which I must admit is a little melodramatic. Overall this is a solid psychological thriller that fans of the genre are likely to enjoy; I'd certainly recommend it.",The Girl on the Train
13,blanche-2,good mystery,8,4 November 2017,"I agree with some posters that the plot was full of holes. Big ones. However, I still enjoyed ""Girl on a Train"" from 2015. I didn't read the book.Rachel (Emily Blunt) is an alcoholic who, since losing her job, spends her days going back and forth on the train past her old neighborhood. There she sees a loving couple, Scott and Megan (Luke Evans and Haley Bennett). Also in that neighborhood is the house she used to live in where now, her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) lives with his new wife Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and their new baby.Megan is actually the nanny of Anna's and Tom's new baby. One day she abruptly quits. Rachel is envious of Megan's relationship with her husband which is so loving. One day she sees Megan with another man on their porch and becomes enraged. Later on, Megan disappears. Rachel has been seen in the neighborhood, stalking Tom and Anna -- and at one point, picked up their baby and took her outside. She falls under suspicion by the detective in charge (Allison Janney) - the theory being that she attacked Megan in the woods thinking she was Anna as the two are blond and resemble one another.I really enjoyed this film and didn't find it at all boring. The acting was excellent - Blunt walks around most of the time with a dazed and half-dead look on her face, but she has scenes in flashback that are quite different. Theroux and Evans have the showiest roles and rise to the occasion. This isn't a difficult mystery to figure out, but it does keep you involved. A reviewer on this site mentioned one hole which actually didn't turn out to be one after all. The other question is, why wasn't she charged with kidnapping when she took the baby outside? I have to think it's because Anna and Tom wrote her off as a pathetic nut - and she did put the baby down. Rather than make a fuss, they didn't press charges. As to why she didn't have a restraining order - yes, major hole, because she could have had one and violated it anyway. Worth seeing.",The Girl on the Train
14,Quinoa1984,dull,4,11 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train boasts a (mostly) intriguing performance by Emily Blunt; she commits to this character as what appears at first to be a 'drunk mess' and is one of three major woman characters in this story of deception and murder. But the plot is simply dumb, and more than that is deathly dull. This would barely pass muster as an episode of Law & Order (or for that latter obviously Lifetime), and despite the appearance of the occasionally dependable Justin Theroux (remember him in Mulholland Drive?) the cast doesn't bring anything to the threadbare characters. The rest of what is essentially a soulless Lifetime movie has nothing to offer. What a lump of a 'thriller'. Even a scene like the one woman describing a tragic incident with her infant that IS dramatically potent gets lost in the slop that is this plot and story and... What characters to even speak of?

Soon the girl on the train finds herself embroiled in a sordid mystery.You can easily become bored with the flashbacks and in spite of decent acting, the finale comes and you may wonder if the amount of strong language was needed with the somewhat disjointed story line.

18,zardoz-13,Girl On The Wrong Track,5,16 October 2016,"Paula Hawkins' runaway bestseller ""The Girl on the Train"" may have been an exciting, suspenseful, murder-mystery to peruse, but the adaptation by ""Help"" director Tate Taylor and ""Secretary"" scenarist Erin Cressida Wilson is a tedious tale to watch. Memorable murder mysteries must contain a large enough selection of characters that could have committed the murder so the dastard's identity isn't initially obvious. ""The Girl on the Train"" features only one character who possibly could have committed the crime. The other two characters that Taylor and Wilson offer as red herrings to lead us astray aren't nearly sinister enough to pass muster. Taylor and Wilson don't allow the other two apparent suspects an adequate amount of screen time to fully establish their incriminating credentials. Indeed, a pair of first-rate sleuths like either Jessica Fletcher of ""Murder, She Wrote"" or Agatha Christie's Mrs. Jane Marple could have solved the case long before the filmmakers unveiled the killer's identity. Predictably, Taylor and Wilson implicate the heroine from the start. Rarely, however, rarely does the heroine turn out to be a villain in a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster, especially when the protagonist is portrayed as a raving drunk. Were this simple violation of murder-mystery melodramas not enough to derail ""The Girl on the Train,"" the next worst thing is the characters numbing lack of appeal. The heroine is depicted as such a passive victim that she inspires either little sympathy or respect. Furthermore, she struggles to follow in the footsteps of Jessica and Jane but with far less success. Typically, the murderer turns out to be the least suspicious person. This is far from the case with ""The Girl on the Train."" The villain is so evident from the get-go that you'll leave this atmospheric R-rated thriller wondering why the filmmakers wasted so much time—112 minutes—to unravel the whodunit.Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt of ""The Devil Wear Prada"") doesn't fool anybody with her deplorable behavior. She divides her time between chugging vodka from a water bottle and cruising on a commuter train to and from Manhattan. Incidentally, the filmmakers have uprooted British author Paula Hawkins's yarn and transplanted it from England to America. Once upon a time, poor little Rachel was married to an uptight, conservative businessman, Tom Watson (Justin Theroux of ""Mulholland Drive""), but fate foiled their plans to forge a family. Rachel desperately wanted to be a mommy, but she was crushed when she couldn't get pregnant. Ultimately, Rachel divorced Tom and walked away with enough alimony to pay for vodka galore to plunge herself into the sinkhole of alcoholism but also to afford rent with a roommate. Not long after her divorce, Rachel lost her job at a public relations firm because she had crawled into the bottle.As the action unfolds, Rachel confides in us that she loves to fantasize about the residents that she watches as he rides back and forth to New York City. If you've ever ridden a train and observed the inhabitants that live along the railway, you'd know how easy it is to adopt her perspective. One day our heroine spots a happily married woman in the arms of a man who isn't her husband! Later, she learns that this happily married lady has been brutally murdered. The individual who killed her literally stomped the life out of her lovely face and left her to rot in the wilderness. Meanwhile, our heroine visits the murdered woman's husband, Scott (Luke Evans of ""Dracula Untold""), because she thinks that she knows the murderer's identity. Eventually, veteran N.Y.P.D. Detective Riley (Allison Janney of television's ""Mom""), shows up to question Rachel about the disappearance of Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett of ""Hardcore Henry"") but Riley gets nowhere. Riley knows enough about the disreputable Rachel to know that she cannot be trusted to provide any suitable information. Furthermore, she knows Rachel has incriminated herself enough that she could be the murderer. We learn that Rachel abhors Tom because he married another woman, and they were able to have a gorgeous little one. In fact, Tom is so affluent that not only does his second wife, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson of ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation""), not have to work for a living, but he has also furnished her with a nanny. Meanwhile, another presumably happily married woman, Megan Hipwell yearns to get pregnant and flings herself in front of anybody willing to accommodate her. Megan cannot tolerate Scott's jealous, manipulative shenanigans, and she seeks solace in the arms of her psychiatrist, Dr. Kamal Abdic (Edgar Ramírez of ""Point Break""), but he holds her at arm's length.One of the problems with ""The Girl on the Train"" is the incomprehensible way that director Tate Taylor and scenarist Erin Cressida Wilson tell their tale. They scramble the chronology of the events so thoroughly that you wind up confused by the various flashbacks. Furthermore, the filmmakers indulge in the abusive psychological practice of gaslighting like the author. This occurs when one character convinces another that the latter is guilty of everything in the world despite their inherent innocence. Our misguided heroine learns one day on her train rides that she has been pumped full of misinformation about herself. The revelation stuns her as much as it will stun those who haven't devoured the Hawkins bestseller. Anybody who craves a good mystery knows from the start that the author will endeavor to mislead them. Nevertheless, the gaslighting gimmick is one of the lowest forms of misinformation because neither the victim nor the spectator has any idea that they have been misguided until it is too late. Ultimately, the villain exposes himself, and nothing about this revelation is surprising. The heroine exonerates herself of all the chaos that she has created for herself when she vanquishes the villain, but the triumph seems rather hollow. Altogether, ""The Girl on the Train"" qualifies as a potboiler that denies us little sense of gratification in the villain's demise.",The Girl on the Train
19,grantss,Moderately interesting,5,16 October 2017,"Rachel travels to and from New York each day on the train. On the way she travels past her old house, where she and her then-husband, Tom, used to live. She admires his new neighbour, Megan, and her seemingly-perfect relationship with her husband. However, Rachel has problems, alcoholism being the most obvious and destructive. Plus she appears to be stalking her ex-husband, his new wife, Anna, and their baby. Then Megan disappears and, due to Megan's resemblance to Anna and Rachel's instability, Rachel is a prime suspect. Thing is, Rachel was in Megan's neighbourhood on the night she was last seen, and recalls seeing Megan, but was too drunk to remember what happened...A moderately interesting thriller / crime-drama. Plot is okay but not overly original or intriguing. Set up is a bit long-winded and a bit confusing. Plot development is a bit too obvious, with director Tate Taylor spoon-feeding information. Even at the end he doesn't know when to stop. Taylor tries to cover up for the lack of depth to the movie by adding a layer of overdone atmosphere that feels fake and often unnecessary. Considering Taylor directed the brilliant social drama The Help and the great James Brown biopic Get On Up, maybe thrillers just aren't his thing.This said, it's not all bad. While not compelling or overly engaging, there is a decent amount of intrigue, enough to keep you watching. Solid performances from a very good cast too.",The Girl on the Train

21,neil-476,Masterclass in Storytelling,8,16 May 2018,"If you watch the trailer you will be shown that this film is about a woman who sees certain events from a train and is possibly implicated in a mysterious disappearance. And I'm not going to tell you any more than the trailer does.I tend to open my reviews with a synopsis of the film in question. In the case of The Girl On A Train (adapted from a bestseller which I haven't read) I'm not going to do that, because I wouldn't want to deprive anyone of the experience I enjoyed, namely the unusual and well-crafted way in which this story was told. Providing a synopsis would damage that experience because it would inevitably entail revealing details which would ruin the way those details are revealed in the film.I have a fascination with storytelling. Most stories have some form of exposition dump in their early stages, whereby the reader/viewer is provided with information they need before the plot can get under way. The plot then unfolds before arriving at a resolution of some sort. In this film, however, we are initially provided with character studies of the main characters. These include expository details, of course but this is almost secondary. The film appears more concerned with creating mood and atmosphere, much of which is calculated to make us ask questions rather than simply supplying us with information. Information is provided, of course, but subtly, and in dribs and drabs.The characters are all well conceived to discharge their functions in the plot (the plot proper doesn't really start until nearly halfway through the film) yet the character traits and the connections between the characters are all natural and believable. For instance, each of the three principal characters has issues concerning childbirth: all are appropriate, relevant and credible, and all drive the plot.Thinking about this film as Story reveals how well-crafted it is, but you don't have to do that. Just enjoying the experience of having the story gradually reveal itself is perfectly sufficient.I don't normally care much for Emily Blunt, but she is wonderful in this. The rest of the cast is good, but she is exceptional.",The Girl on the Train

Meeting a family friend over the weekend,I got told that the film (the book of which he has not read)was much better than expected,which led to me deciding to take a gamble and get on the train.The plot:Losing her job over alcoholism after her husband Tom has cheated with Anna Boyd, Rachel Watson starts having black-outs which leave Watson unable to remember what's happened. Keeping secret that she's been sacked from her flatmate,Rachel takes long train rides to pass the ""work time."" Taking a train which goes straight pass Tom and Anna's (who has just had a baby) house,Watson starts looking at Tom's neighbours Scott and Megan Hipwell,who appear happily married.One day,Rachel catches Megan kissing another man at the house.Horrified at her ""perfect image"" being broken,Watson jumps off the train to confront Megan. Binge drinking before the train ride,Watson faints before reaching Megan. Waking up in her apartment covered in blood and bruises,Rachel finds that she can't remember how she got home,as Rachel learns that Megan is missing.View on the film:Getting on-board during early stage of her pregnancy, (kept secret from cast/crew!) Emily Blunt gives a blistering anti-Femme Fatale Film Noir loner performance as Rachael. Dimly looking at the ""perfect"" couples across the tracks with eyes caked in black,Blunt superbly unseats the staggered nature of the Noir loner, pouring Watson out in bitter blends of over-confidence in protecting her ""perfect"" images,and a Noir pit that lands Watson with harsh reality. Joining in this prime cut ""Women's Picture"" Neo-Noir and also taking a liking to twitchy Justin Theroux's Tom, Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Bennett give excellent performance as Anna and Megan,with Bennett making Megan a bundle of sexy Neo-Noir temptation, whilst Ferguson fractures Anna's suburban, picket-line fence image created by Rachel,to release the bubbling Noir Fury.Changing tracks from the London setting of Paula Hawkins's book to New York,the screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson corkscrews the thrills for a simmering Neo-Noir atmosphere. Dovetailing fragmented flashbacks to Rachael going off the rails,Wilson presents with a sharp clarity the slurring state of Rachel,lit in sudden turns of aggression and a tense piecing together of her ""forgotten"" train ride. Opening the bottle to Tom's various relationships,Wilson cuts into an evil under the sun Noir mood, shining from a subtle, gradual changes in perspective,seeping a crisp Noir awareness under the nails of Anna and Rachael.Buying a Noir Thriller ticket for the first time in his credits,director Tate Taylor & cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen stylishly tap at the burnt Noir loner state of Rachael with grubby low-lighting opening the blackened,decayed wounds of Rachael. Backed by a shimmering score from Danny Elfman,Taylor layers the darkness with chilling stylisation of slow-motion rain hitting the frosty tracks,and screams from a horror-like nightmare linking Rachel's torn ticket memories.",The Girl on the Train

24,phd_travel,Better than Gone Girl,6,12 October 2016,"With the epidemic of divorce and adultery going on its quite interesting to see the devastating effects of it on a woman. Emily Blunt plays a woman suffering because her husband dumped her for another woman and now has a child. I liked this more than ""Gone Girl"" because the central character is more sympathetic. And there is less ridiculous violence and gross sexuality in Girl on the Train than in Gone Girl. The good parts about Girl on the Train are: 1. it is involving until and believable that is until the killing at the end - it should just have been an expose to the cops not a gross stabbing which would have been more realistic. 2. the complicated structure isn't confusing - well directed 3. Emily Blunt acts like the alcoholic victim of adultery and divorce quite well. Moving and believable. She is a leading lady now and this role suits her because she isn't too beautiful. 4. Good performances by the 3 leads the rising star Haley Bennett who plays it dumb enough to do what she did, and Rebecca Ferguson. 5. The villain is predictable about half way through and there is no twist after that which is actually good - too many twists spoil a movie. It's not about keeping people guessing so much as how things play out. Bad points: 1. the killing at the end made the whole thing seem like a typical thriller. Not necessary at all. Just being caught by the cops would have been enough. 2. the men are portrayed as brutes who can't control their urges. Luke Evans looks brutish with less hair.

But it's by far the least of these. As far as technical filmmaking and cast go, there's no issue. The problem is the unpleasant story, its lack of sympathetic characters and the partly-troubling message at the end.The tale starts off confusing, but everything naturally comes together by the end and makes sense. Unfortunately, the journey there isn't very compelling and, like I said, the more you get to know the main characters the less you care for them, with one exception. The ultimate message is worthy, but also troubling if you think about it. I can't say anymore without giving anything away.At the end of the day this is an ugly flick with not enough to redeem it. The movies cited above also have seriously unsavory elements, but they override the ugliness one way or another.The film runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot entirely in New York: the Hudson River area north of the city, as well as the city itself from Bear Mountain in the closing scene.GRADE: C/C-",The Girl on the Train
26,gradyharp,'I need to remember.',10,21 January 2017,"Paula Hawkins' popular and controversial novel THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN has been successfully transferred to the screen intact by screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson and the beautifully photographed (Charlotte Bruus Christenen) and scored (by Danny Elfman) and paced story is the work of director Tate Taylor. Much like the novel the story bounces around form point of view of various characters and time forward and time back sequences that make the story that much more compelling. The cast is outstanding, with special kudos to Emily Blunt.The story is that of Rachel Watson's (Emily Blunt) life post-divorce. Every day, she takes the train in to work in New York, and every day the train passes by her old house. The house she lived in with her husband Tom (Justin Theroux), who still lives there, with his new wife Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and child. As she attempts to not focus on her pain, she starts watching a couple who live a few houses down -- Megan (Haley Bennett) and Scott Hipwell (Luke Evans). She creates a wonderful dream life for them in her head, about how they are a perfect happy family. And then one day, as the train passes, she sees something shocking – Anna kissing another man - filling Rachel with rage. The next day, she wakes up with a horrible hangover, various wounds and bruises, and no memory of the night before. She has only a feeling: something bad happened. Then come the TV reports: Megan Hipwell is missing. Rachel becomes invested in the case and trying to find out what happened to Megan, where she is, and what exactly she herself was up to that same night Megan went missing. The psychiatrist Dr. Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez) enters the intricate plot, seeing several of the characters in session, and the investigation of Megan's death is headed by Detective Riley (Allison Janney). The ending is a well-plotted dénouement and climax.Altogether a well-created film that pays attention to the psychological effects of alcoholism, spouse abuse, kidnapping, and contemporary marital relationships that are fragile at best.

The ill protagonist's memories are scattered, disjointed, and go back and forth in time. Then there is the artistic flair, of added , violent, sexual, random events/memories from the protagonist to create a 60's Euro style flair. The flash backs add noting, and cause a distraction. What worked: The acting was good. Most movies nowadays have great acting. The antagonist, and protagonist play their roles. The husband plays the complete psycho down pat. The protagonist figures out events and the Girl on the Train's story becomes aligned, and better to follow. The ending of the Girl on the Train is strong.

30,JamesHitchcock,Suburban Neo-Noir,8,14 November 2016,"""The Girl on the Train"" can be seen as an example of neo-noir, an updated version of film noir using modern cinematic techniques. Whereas traditional noir, however, tended to be a male-dominated genre, this film puts three female characters at the centre of the action. The three are Rachel Watson, a divorcée, Anna, the second wife of Rachel's ex-husband Tom, and Megan Hipwell, a neighbour of Tom and Anna.Although the immediate cause of Rachel's divorce was Tom's affair with Anna, two important factors in the breakdown of their marriage were her infertility and her alcoholism which made her prone to self-destructive behaviour. She is unable to come to terms with the end of her marriage, and has begun stalking Tom and Anna. She spends much of her time riding on the train- hence the title- which will take her past her former home, where Tom still lives with Anna and their young daughter Evie. On the journey she can clearly see the Hipwells' home. Rachel did not actually know the Hipwells when she lived near them, and in her imagination Megan and her husband Scott become the perfect married couple, sharing together the happiness which Rachel herself could never find during her marriage to Tom.One day, Rachel sees from the train Megan kissing a man other than her husband on the balcony of her home. Distraught by the shattering of her illusions about the ""perfect family"" and angered by what she presumes to be Megan's infidelity, Rachel takes it upon herself to confront her. Shortly afterwards Megan goes missing, presumed dead. This development sets in motion a chain of events culminating in Rachel falling under suspicion of having murdered Megan.The film has been criticised on this board and elsewhere for being predictable. If one views it simply as a murder mystery it probably is- I realised who the real murderer would turn out to be long before this twist was officially revealed- but then I would not advise anyone to go to the cinema in the expectation that this will be a straightforward whodunit. As with some of Hitchcock's dramas the emphasis is more on psychology than on police procedure, although in this case the psychology being examined is not so much that of the criminal as that of some of the other characters, especially Rachel.With the possible exception of ""The Young Victoria"", this is probably the best performance I have yet seen from Emily Blunt. Rachel is a difficult role to play. She is on the one hand a flawed, erratic and self-destructive character. She is mistaken in her envy of Scott and Megan, whose marriage is in reality far from idyllic, and perhaps also in her resentment of Anna, who is no happier as the second Mrs Watson than Rachel was as the first. (As the saying goes, when a man leaves his wife and marries his mistress he creates a vacancy). Yet Rachel must never seem wholly unsympathetic. The audience must always believe that, despite her alcoholism, she retains a certain inner decency, so that the revelation that she is not the murderer will not come as a surprise. Other good contributions come from Rebecca Ferguson as Anna and Justin Theroux as Tom.One of the functions of film noir was to reveal the murky reality underlying a façade of apparent respectability, and this is a function which neo-noir continues to perform. The idea that the inhabitants of middle-class suburbia may be less respectable and more troubled than they appear at first sight is not exactly an original one; it has formed the subject-matter of numerous works of fiction, both in literature and in the cinema, for decades. ""The Girl on the Train"", however, uses its murder-mystery format to give a new slant to this subject. I had not come across director Tate Taylor before, but on the strength of this film he seems one to watch. 8/10",The Girl on the Train

The story is pretty simple Emily Blunt plays Rachel a depressed lady who's full of rage and loss she's a divorced alcoholic who passes her time away by riding the daily train to the city from her New York suburb. And along the way she starts to see some revealing visuals and sights as it's always what the eye sees can reveal a lot. And this little view is a tangled web of lies, sex, and drama it involves Rachel's ex husband and his new family with the wild card player being a young beauty named Megan(Haley Bennett)who's a nanny to Rachel's ex husband and it turns out to be more as the twists take a path to lust and murder.

The story centers around Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) who is the alcoholic ex-wife of Tom Watson (Justin Theroux). For much of the movie it appears Rachel's drinking has messed up her entire life. She is living on her alimony checks from Tom and riding the train past her old house every morning. Because of her drinking, she thinks she sees Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) on the porch of a neighbors house kissing another man(other than husband). From this, things get complicated, as Rachel's memory is so blasted that she thinks things happened that actually did not happen. Allison Janney is Detective Riley trying to sort out Rachel's problem mind and the murder of Megan played very well by Haley Bennett. The cast helps making the story telling very powerful.This film is different, as about 2/3rds of the way through most viewers will know who the killer is.

33,lasttimeisaw,a middling film with a rousing leading performance,7,30 October 2016,"A cinema-going of this best-seller parlayed movie adaptation with Tate Taylor at the helm, an able hand behind THE HELP (2011). THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN's female-centred story-line and its bleak scenario immediately recall David Fincher's GONE GIRL (2014), but here the structure and emphasis are clearly leaning towards a whodunit genre thriller, shepherded by a fearless performance from its leading actress. Emily Blunt plays the titular girl, Rachel Watson, a daily commuter on the train to-and-fro Manhattan (transposed from London in Hawkins' source novel), call her a ""girl"", a term spontaneously suggests youth and allure, might seem to be a stretch in the context, since Rachel is an absolute sad sack, she is divorced from his husband Tom Watson (Theroux) but still keeps his surname, who cheated on her with a comely beauty Anna (Ferguson) when she descends into depression and alcoholism after procreation keeps evading them. Now Tom has remarried Anna, they have an infant girl and live together in the house where she used to live, that's the excruciating sting she has to face on a daily basis, while she stays in her friends Cathy's (Prepon) apartment and unbeknown to the latter, she had lost her job due to her drinking problem, which makes her train-commuting a habitual ritual to while away her aimless life, but there is one thing becomes the fulcrum of her attention, the young couple live nearby Tom and Anna's house, whom she is able to glance twice a day from the train, for her, they represent everything she once had and yearns to have. Until, one day, a scene she witnesses shatters her fantasy, soon the young wife becomes a gone girl, only her blackout memory becomes the key to solve the murder.The young girl is Megan (Bennett) and her hubby is Scott (Evans), and the happiness of their marriage only exits in Rachel's imagination. From Megan's past secret, to the chasm between her and Scott, till the trigger of her unfortunate doom, all concerns pregnancy and motherhood, along with Rachel's self-inflicted misery, it becomes a motif too convenient to stand for women's dismay and their marriage problems, frankly speaking, in the case of Megan, her own sense of naivety and promiscuity should also partially be responsible for her tragedy. As for Rachel, the story will eventually vindicate all her foibles, and pigeonhole her as an innocent being unwittingly victimized by a horrible horndog, she is completely blameless in the whole act, this stratagem tastes stale compared to GONE GIRL's more forensic dissection into a couple's marriage fissure and most of the time, it always takes two to tango. That's the insight which the story inherently lacks. Maybe the comparison isn't fair in the first place because Taylor is not in the same bracket of Fincher as far as craftsmanship is concerned, the movie is uninspiringly enveloped by downcast environs where everything looks bleached and vague by a disheartening lighting strategy, even during its suspenseful switcheroo, it fails grandly to sustain a menacing vibe, in spite of all the narrative jumps and telling revelations, at best, it is a prosaic Hollywood assembly-line pablum.But there is one silver lining which rescues this feature from plunging into that abyss, it is the cast, if the Theroux-Ferguson pair doesn't turn out as book readers may expect in the final act, both Bennett and Evans imbues a leavening of pathos into their none-too sympathetic personae, but in the end of the day, it is Blunt's heart-rending show-stopper becomes the saving grace, cosmetic- free, awfully scuzzy, hands-trembling, she convincingly enlivens a character who is stricken with anguish and consumed by alcoholic toxin, a beyond-repair damaged-goods ultimately exerts her vengeance in that one deadly strike, it is such a cliché, but because of Blunt's superbly unwavering submersion into the character, the ending feels agreeably rewarding. Unfortunately, she doesn't have the mainstay (a sterling reception of the movie all across the board) which successfully propels Rosamund Pike into the Oscar foray, so it will be a greatly pleasant surprise if she can sneak into that ultra-tight race on the Oscar nomination night.",The Girl on the Train
34,KineticSeoul,Very boring mystery crime drama.,3,7 January 2017,"This is one of those mystery movies that tries to be more than what it really is. In another words the whole premise and direction felt like it was dragged out way too much. Without adding anything all that thrilling or interesting to sit through. In another words, it's a extremely slow movie to get into and the payoff isn't really worth it either. The plot focuses in on multiple women, especially on a girl named Rachel played by Emily Blunt. Who constantly has black outs and alcoholic problem. Who also deals with paranoia and psychological problems. I did like how people's perspective of others might not be entirely what it seems. Like behind a smile could be sadness and despair and etc. And I thought the scenes where Rachel has this jealousy towards a couple who she thinks has the perfect love life to play an interesting twist in the story. However the constant delving into the mindset and inner demons of each of the characters to be lackluster and easily forgettable. I personally think more of a focus on solving the mystery would have added more to thrills and enticing moments. But for like an hour into this movie, I couldn't grasp what this movie was about because it just seemed like it was all over the place. Now for some movies this direction can work but for this one it just came off very distracting from the core of the story. Because the drama parts and expositions is a complete snooze fest. I did like the psychedelic cinematography with some dream like sequences. But it didn't connect me to any of the character or made me want to keep on guessing on what is really going on. Overall, I regret watching this movie and I will probably forget about it in like 2 days.3/10",The Girl on the Train

Even baffling. There's an uneasy feel to this from the start. Something's off. Something's not right. Is this even reality, or is it a fantasy taking place inside the mind of a very disturbed woman? The disturbed woman in this case is Rachel (Emily Blunt.) She's an alcoholic and rides the same train every day, past the house where she used to live with her ex-husband. She sees their neighbours, and wonders about them and about their relationship. The female neighbour is the nanny to her ex-husband, his new wife and their baby. The movie mixes the story of all three (Rachel, Anna - the new wife, and Megan - the nanny) together. What drives it forward is that Megan has gone missing, and the question is what happened to her and who was responsible.For a while I found this an unpleasant movie to watch. To be honest, I had to turn it off at about the half hour mark. It wasn't hitting home with me. But there was something about it that drew me back; I needed to see how this was going to turn out. In the end I was glad that I did. It overcomes the bleakness of the first half hour and although it still seems to walk the line uneasily between fantasy and reality, the mystery involved gets more and more engrossing, and the plot twist (you knew something had to be coming) happens with about a half hour to go - and it was, to me at least, completely unexpected. Not all is as it seems to be. The inter-twining of the stories of Rachel, Anna and Megan leads up to a sobering finish.In the end I was surprised to discover that I was actually quite awakened from the slumber-inducing first half hour or so and really wanted to see how this was going to end. Emily Blunt's portrayal of Rachel was strong. The supporting cast was all right - I didn't think there were any outstanding performances aside from Blunt's, but it was Blunt's movie, and she pulled it off. It has to overcome that slow and bewildering first half hour, and it won't appeal to those who want a straightforward plot or who are put off by a movie with overtly dark tones. But by the time this was over I could honestly say that I was glad I watched it. (6/10)",The Girl on the Train
36,Hellmant,What's most impressive about the film is it's three lead performances (Emily Blunt is amazing)!,8,21 November 2016,"'THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new hit mystery thriller, starring Emily Blunt (in an amazing performance), Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson. It's based on the 2015 novel, of the same name, by Paula Hawkins (her debut novel). The film tells the story of an alcoholic divorcée, who becomes a suspect in a missing persons investigation. It also costars Justin Theroux, Luke Evans, Allison Janney, Edgar Ramirez and Lisa Kudrow. Tate Taylor (who previously helmed 'THE HELP' and 'GET ON UP') directed the movie, and Erin Cressida Wilson wrote the script (she also wrote the screenplays for the 2002 sex-comedy 'SECRETARY' and the 2009 sexy thriller 'CHLOE'). The film only received mixed reviews from critics, but it's been a huge hit at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it. Rachel Watson (Blunt) suffers from severe depression, after her husband (Theroux) left her for another woman (Ferguson). She's also a severe alcoholic, and she blames her divorce on it. Everyday Rachel drives by her ex-husband's house, on her way to work, stalking him (and his new family). She also watches a couple living in the house next to him. One day the woman from that house (Bennett) goes missing, and Rachel becomes a suspect in her disappearance. Rachel was close by when she disappeared, but she doesn't remember what happened; due to the fact that she was blacked out, from drinking too much.The movie is a little slow-building at first, but it does payoff with a pretty intense climax and conclusion. As a viewer you're never quite sure what's going on either, and there are some nice twists packed in as well. What's most impressive about the film is it's three lead performances though, they're all fantastic; especially Blunt (but I'm becoming a big Haley Bennett fan as well). I enjoyed the movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/191482784",The Girl on the Train
37,thesar-2,Gone Girl on a Train Wreck,8,7 January 2017,"Much like 2016's Hell or High Water was No Country for Old Men-lite, 2016's The Girl on the Train was Gone Girl-lite. So, if you liked the latter movies, you'll like the 2016 releases.I try my absolute best to avoid spoilers and even going as far as skipping trailers. But, The Girl on the Train did somewhat hit my radar and, luckily and surprisingly, it surpassed and altered my expectations. I had no idea it was about a drunk. (Says Steve as he takes another gulp of Bud Light.)So, if you wanna know less about this experience like I gleefully did, minor spoilers ahead. I do not ruin plot points or surprises, but I do offer up brief synopsizes in my reviewsthings I don't even wanna know myself until I see the movie. I highly recommend you seeing this anyways, so do. And then come back here. After you bookmarked this, of course.The movie opens with some beautiful shots of the travels of a ""girl,"" haha – definitely a woman, on a train who fantasizes about the homes she passes on the way to work. She has a self-proclaimed overactive imagination and I could relate. I, too, look at other people, locations, scenarios and daydream up their entire story.But, then a sparkle of a deeper story emerges of some of the places and people this ""girl/woman"" sees. More and more onion layers are sliced away until you realize how much this random passenger is actually involved in these stranger's lives. Oh, and there's a murder involved and we need to determine on who's responsible. I've actually heard many negative things about this, and quite frankly, I respectively disagree. I had a great time with the shifting timelines to tell a compelling story of a who/why-dunnit. As mentioned about, it reminded me a lot of Gone Girl, and it does in atmosphere and storytelling and as good as I think this movie is, it's not close to that caliber. Nevertheless, it's completely worth it and a fun, pulp fiction tale that won't change the world, or cinema as we know it, but will entertain us as if we, too, had a long train ride and needed to occupy our time.***Final thoughts: It's a tad long and not to be taken completely seriously, but stick with it. At least, it has the always hunky Edgar Ramírez in it. There's that, at least.",The Girl on the Train

39,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Gradually evolves into a solid, superior thriller",9,12 October 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Rachel (Emily Blunt) travels on a train every morning, and has whimsical thoughts about the seemingly perfect couple, Megan (Haley Bennett) and Scott (Luke Evans), as a welcome distraction from her own fractured personal life, after husband Tom (Justin Theroux) had an affair and moved in with Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) after they drifted apart after her failure to conceive. One day, Rachel spots something that shatters this seemingly perfect illusion, when she spots Megan seemingly having an affair with Kamel (Edgar Ramirez), her therapist. But, after Megan goes missing, they will all come to discover their fates are all more inextricably linked than they can imagine.Here, we have another adaptation of a book that 'everyone's been talking about', in the vein of Gone Girl nearly two years ago. I tend to read the works of authors I'm familiar with, or of subject matter I might have a curiosity about, so I never tend to be one of those who knows which book they're talking about. But this isn't such a bad thing, as it leaves me to enjoy the film more on its own level (with absolutely no idea what's going to happen and all) and, with a touch of patience as a lot of films now seem to require, The Girl on the Train gradually evolves into something quite special.It doesn't feel like it was marketed exactly as what it is, emerging as more than just a cheap, frivolous thriller into something a lot deeper and more lingering. At first, it all seems to be meandering around and going too slowly, leaving me to feel like I've wondered into the 'chick flick' some people have been mentioning. But if you stick with it, what emerges is a complex, pleasingly intricate piece of work, that demands your full attention and really develops in ways you wouldn't expect, leaving a thoroughly satisfying pay off.In the lead role, Blunt's American accent is a little dodgy, occasionally lapsing back and forth between that and her native English voice. But her performance, like everyone else's, is fine, and perfectly suits the material (although given being thirty plus, surely it's more The Woman on a Train than Girl???) This is an intriguing, stirring blend of moving human drama and riveting suspense thriller, of the slow and patient kind that are getting rarer these days. ****",The Girl on the Train
40,paul2001sw-1,Confused and confusing,3,5 February 2020,"Emily Blunt can't keep her accent straight in Tate Taylor's film 'The Girl on the Train'; but that's not the only thing that's wonky in this confusing, and confused, film about an alcoholic prone to blackouts who may or may not have been involved in a murder for reasons unknown to her. The plot is hopelessly contrived, the characters make little sense, and the dialogue is unconvincing.

41,MOscarbradley,Taylor drags this one out.,3,12 October 2016,"Is ""The Girl on the Train"" this year's ""Gone Girl"" or is it this years ""50 Shades of Gray""? Sadly this 21st century 'women's picture' is more Gray than Gone and had me crying out for the good old days of Bette and Joan. Instead we get Emily Blunt, (so much better than the material she's given to work with), as well as Jennifer Lawrence lookalike Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson as three women caught up in a fairly obvious murder plot. These are women who have suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune mostly at the hands of the men in their lives, here played by Justin Theroux, Luke Evans and Edgar Ramirez.I haven't read Paula Hawkins' novel but this bestseller seems to me to be fairly aimed at a female audience who know doubt will lap up all the trials on show. The fact that the film isn't really any good certainly won't prevent it from being a huge hit nor will it stop Emily Blunt picking up an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, (she certainly pulls out all the stops), and, of course, director Tate Taylor has already proved his worth where actresses are concerned with ""The Help"". This certainly isn't in the same class nor does it bode will for Taylor as a director of suspense movies. He reveals the killer's identity too early on and then drags the film out for at least another 30 minutes or so.",The Girl on the Train
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An admirable adaptation that weaves its perspectives into the very fabric of its story-telling.,7,19 March 2018,"Its execution may not quite reach its intention but to adapt a book with differing perspectives, each containing several integral internal monologues, without resorting to any sort of narration or indeed diluting the source so much that it loses its twisty, turbulent identity is admirable to say the least. It's actually even more impressive that each only somewhat condensed perspective is differentiated visually to the point that the camera itself conveys the story of 'The Girl On The Train (2016)' almost as much as the screenplay does. It's these perspectives that are integral to the various reveals, revelations, twists and turns that essentially make this secretive story so successful because it's a mystery which would be instantly solvable were the feature not blatantly hiding specific snippets of information under the sort of ingenious guise of its misguided and unreliable protagonists. When we're not given the information, it never feels like a betrayal of our trust because their perspectives are so ingrained with the very fabric of the film that it only feels logical we should be denied the information they themselves don't give each other or perhaps can't even remember.

44,dromasca,slow building crime drama,7,5 January 2017,"There are a few missed opportunities in The Girl on the Train directed by Tate Taylor bringing to screen Paula Hawkins's successful novel. The story starts like a voyeuristic drama involving three women (two of them resembling each other), two houses (resembling each other as well in a suburban area), two men, and one train which is the moving observation point from which flashes of the reality are perceived. Details are not clear from the beginning, the story builds up and so does our understanding of the characters and the drama that is taking place, which soon turns into a disappearance case. All this gradual assimilation of the events by the viewer is not a bad thing, it's not an easy viewing, but it's challenging intellectually and the later developments and its solution are eventually rewarding. There is however something 'heavy' in the director's style that adds extra and unnecessary obstacles between the heroes and the viewers.I did not read (yet) the book that inspired the film, but my understanding is that much if its interest derives from the fact that the story is told alternatively by the three women, each with her subjective point of view, each holding piece of the reality the way she sees it (or deforms it). The film tries to start this way using off-voice screen (which seldom works for me) but soon moves the weight center of the story to Rachel's character played by Emily Blunt. We gradually come to know her as a broken person, victim of a disastrous marriage, alcoholic, voyeuristic, unable to forget and continuing to be obsessed by the life and the husband she lost. As the story develops she becomes involved as a witness, as a detective, as a prime suspect in the disappearance turning into a murder case. The cinematographic version of The Girl on the Train is very much a story about Rachel, about her obsessions and her fight to recover her own self.The story offers the opportunity for three major and consistent feminine roles, an opportunity which only Emily Blunt uses well. This is not necessarily because Haley Bennett or Rebecca Ferguson are bad actors. but because the way they are directed is much more conventional and lacks complexity. The other surprise in acting is Luke Evans, who acts the other prime suspect, and the man who eventually will disperse the part of the fog on what really happened and who really Rachel is. The rest is left by the script (maybe also by the book) to fate.Director Tate Taylor does not lack some good directing ides. See for example the alternate usage of fixed or hand-held camera, sometimes in the the same scene or filming the two actors of a dialog, He fails in constructing a better paced story telling. Some of this may be intentional in order to leave to viewers gradually discovering what the story is about. They did not lose me, but they risk losing many other viewers in search of an entertaining thriller. Trading pace and action for psychology is a risky proposal nowadays. I do not believe that the director won the bet.",The Girl on the Train
45,ThomasDrufke,"Not the Thriller I Was Looking For, but It's Not All that Bad",6,7 October 2016,"Directing a thriller has to be an extraordinary task. It seems like more often than not thrillers are either incredible or completely flat footed. The Girl on the Train actually winds up falling somewhere in between. The performances are top notch but it doesn't feel like the end product met how high the promise was here.It's directed by Tate Taylor, the man behind the brilliant 2011 drama, The Help. So at first glance, I wasn't so sure he was the right fit for the project. I didn't read the book, but I know a lot of people compared it to Gone Girl, and that's a completely different tone than he has ever done. As it turns out, I was probably right. It's not that Taylor does a bad job with this story, it's just that I think it needed a different viewpoint and take. A thriller is supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, and while it has its thrills, I can't say it had the consistent edgy feel that I wanted it to.The strength of The Girl on the Train comes from its cast. There are 6 significant roles here, 3 women and 3 men, and every single one of them brings their 'A' game. Emily Blunt, Rebecca Ferguson, Haley Bennett, Justin Theroux, Luke Evans, and Edgar Ramirez are all great. This is the second film in a few weeks that proved to me Bennett needs to be getting more lead roles in films. She was terrific. Blunt is my favorite actress working today and she once again blew me away with her talent. If the quality of the overall film was higher, she may have been up for her first Oscar in February. The others are equally as good, but it's difficult to access their performances without getting into spoiler territory.Much of the film was shrouded in secrecy, in fact, the trailers didn't spoil as much of the film as I thought they did. I can't say the film gave me the heart-pounding thrills or jaw-dropping reveals I was hoping for as promised by those trailers, but it's not like I came away with a bad film going experience. It's just not the film I thought I was getting. Some pacing issues and a so-so adaption job by the director prevent it from being the next Gone Girl, so in some ways that could come as disappointment, but it's still an entertaining thriller with some terrific performances all around.+Performances are extraordinary+When it does thrill, it really thrills-Clearly a difficult adaptation from the book-Pacing issues6.9/10",The Girl on the Train

First, she started drinking after receiving terrible personal news and her husband, Tom (Justin Theroux) ran off with Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and divorced Rach. Now, this often tipsy lady rides the train to Manhattan every day, where she seems to do little except gawk at the houses on the Hudson River route. You see, Rachel passes right by the house she shared with Tom, where he now lives with A and their baby Evie. Sometimes Rach gets a glimpse of their new happiness. More important, another couple, two doors down, also interests Rachel, as she feels they are the ""perfect couple"". This would be Megan (Haley Bennett) and Scott (Luke Evans). They are often on the back deck embracing, making Rachel believe in true love. Alas, it is false. One day Rachel spies Megan kissing another man, a therapist Dr. Kamal (Edgar Ramirez). Then, all Hades breaks loose. Megan disappears and no one knows where she is. When a detective (Alison Janney) shows up at Rachel's residence, a room in a friend's house, the policewoman tells Rachel that she was seen in an area where Megan was last spotted. The trouble is, Rachel has inebriated blackouts and CANNOT remember what happens in the midst of them, this time included. Could Rachel possibly be a murderer? This very fine thriller has been adapted faithfully from the great book, except in one aspect; its set in Manhattan not London! Even so, Blunt is still a Brit transplant and our Emily is amazingly wonderful in a complex role. She is my FAVORITE ACTRESS of the 21st century and this performance is another winning one in a list growing longer. The other female cast members are likewise wonderful; Bennett as the gorgeous but troubled Megan, Ferguson as the equally lovely, husband-stealing Anna and Janney as the tough police detective. Alas, the male cast members don't fare quite as well. Ramirez is the best, handsome and sensitive, while Evans is rather scary as the explosive Scott. Theroux seems perfect, being a charming guy who can turn dark, but, in this case, he doesn't get a chance to deliver. Perhaps, the director didn't give him enough guidance, as the ladies shine brightly. It's unfortunate. Yet, its not a deal maker as far as the film's overall positive experience.

The film never explores what she does from the time she takes the train in the morning until she takes it again in the afternoon. It is therefore just not credible.

52,zkonedog,A Formula Film Based On Unsustainable Source Material (i.e. Gone Girl Clone),3,27 February 2017,"When I read the novel version of ""Girl On The Train"", I thought it was a decent read though relying on a lot of ""smoke and mirrors"" to hold audience interest. I actually thought it might make a better movie. I can't say that was the case in this adaptation, however, which turns out to be rather unexciting and bland.For a basic summary, ""Girl On The Train"" tells the story of Rachel (Emily Blunt), who commutes on a train through a residential area. Each day, she gazes out the window and acts as a sort of voyeur into the lives of the houses along the tracks. You see, she used to reside in one of those houses with ex husband Tom (Justin Theroux), who now is married with child to Anna (Rebecca Ferguson). Rachel, a raging alcoholic, can't quite let that past go, even confronting the pair multiple times. One day, while on her train, Rachel sees a rather strange occurrence a few doors down involving beautiful neighbor Megan (Haley Bennett). A missing persons investigation is begun, and all parties seem to have something strange going on related to the case.The main problem with this movie is that, contrary to my thought after reading the book, it can't duplicate the trickery of the printed page. The book had a cliffhanger ending nearly every chapter, so even when things got confusing it provided enough ""OMG"" moments to keep turning the pages. While the movie streamlined things and actually made the main plot easier to understand, it took away much of the drama. Essentially, the book relied on trickery that the movie couldn't duplicate. When the story is told ""straight though"", if you will, it loses a lot of its gusto.I would also consider ""Girl On The Train"" to be a rather odd, uninspiring movie in the way it deals with its characters. Besides Blunt's Rachel, the male and female characters are all the same. Tom and therapist Kamal (Edgar Ramirez) are cut from the same cloth, while Ferguson and Bennett are so close visually that it sometimes takes a keen eye to keep them straight. One would think that a story featuring a number of potentially-interesting characters would do more to differentiate them.A final personal observation: As a male, I had a really hard time identifying with the anxieties of the film. This is a very female-focused film, which isn't a bad thing by any means (probably should be more of those around, to be honest). It's just that this movie (as oddly bland as it is) really relies on the viewer to buy into the fears of the female characters. As a male, I struggled to do that, and the acting/story/direction couldn't do it for me.In short, ""Girl On The Train"" is a ""Gone Girl"" clone that doesn't nearly live up to that predecessor. It's a half-baked mystery tale (which doesn't really amount to anything all that interesting in the endgame) filled with a cast of really pretty people. It is an adequate date movie but anyone looking for something more will likely be disappointed.",The Girl on the Train

54,eddie_baggins,Bitterly disappointing,2,13 October 2016,"Bitterly disappointing.It's the best way I could describe my feelings towards Tate Taylor's The Girl on the Train adaptation.A film so devoid of any imagination, life or characters worth caring for, this 100 minute thriller is one of 2016's biggest letdowns and the millions of fans of Paula Hawkin's popular (if somewhat polarising) book are likely to be left cold by this big budgeted wannabe Gone Girl.The comparisons to David Fincher's 2014 hit, that in many ways shares similarities to this tale of domestic (un)bliss, murder and intrigue were always going to be made and have been made by many in the lead up to Girl on the Train's release and now that we've been able to lay our eyes on Taylor's film, it pales in every department.Core to the failures when comparing the films is in both the tales characters who were interesting in Gone Girl and uninvolving here in Train while the most important aspect of a thriller of this nature being the mystery that draws us into the murky world is quite sadly bereft here as around 30 – 40 minutes from the films conclusion Taylor has played his reveal card far too early as any chance we had of being under illusion as who is who is taken away and the films rather grizzly final stanza feels worse off for it, despite the best efforts of the films talented and underused cast.Looking worse for wear and giving her all, Emily Blunt tries desperately to elevate the film around her in her portrayal of hard drinking and divorced Rachel who is our films focus but despite her commitment and dedication Rachel is not an overly appealing character and remains hard to watch for most of the films runtime. It's a great showcase for Blunt's continual work to push herself as an actress but surrounded by the miscast Justin Theroux and Luke Evans and the misused Haley Bennett, Girl on the Train ends up delivering one of the years great crimes against talented cast members.At the end of the day there's not much more to say about Girl on the Train other than the fact this is a real non-event and an event that could've easily become the years big breakout thriller.So uninspired and against all the odds boring, Tate Taylor's film is not even worthy to be mentioned in the same sentence as Gone Girl or even other lesser thrillers of similar ilk, so disappointing for all who were involved in this ""could've been"" film.

55,TheMovieDiorama,"Not a train wreck, but it's a slow moving train...",7,8 October 2016,"Based on the best selling novel, The Girl On The Train is about an alcoholic who takes the train everyday and was the last person to witness a girl who has gone missing. This was hyped to be the biggest thriller of the year, I mean the book is supposed to be great. Now I'm reviewing this without having read the book. Before going into this I was already comparing this to Gone Girl which in my opinion is the best thriller in the last five years, this however was not a bad attempt...but it does have its flaws. Firstly the greatest thing about this adaptation is Emily Blunt, she was so consumed by her character that I didn't recognise her...she was completely enveloped in her role. It was not an easy character to portray either, an alcoholic who believes she is horrible person...there are so many layers. The rest of the cast were also good, Justin Theroux and Luke Evans were particularly great. The build up of the story was developed well, slowly placing breadcrumbs for the viewers to follow. There are quite a few characters who are all possible culprits and each of them have a good amount of screen time in order for us to decide who we think did it. The climactic ending was logical and makes perfect sense so the 'twist' is not ridiculously ludicrous (which a lot of thrillers tend to include). The direction was also great, while not the main function of the film...this is all about story and characters and it succeeds. I also like the structure of the film, mixing in flashbacks and the present time in order to fill in the gaps. There are however some flaws. The first 20 minutes of the film introduces all of the characters in an unimaginable way, it was literally 4 minutes with each character and then the story starts. Due to this structure, the first half of the film does have pacing issues and it does take some time to become fully invested in the story. There are also a few slow motion scenes that are choppily edited, probably to resemble the alcohol taking effect, but the continuous use of this method did seem outdated. Also, I wanted to see more Lisa Kudrow! You can't use an actress from Friends for just 5 minutes, give her more screen time! Overall, The Girl On The Train was a slow paced decent thriller that had a great climax and starred Emily Blunt who was the main attraction, completely captivating and probably her best performance to date.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",The Girl on the Train
56,Ed-Shullivan,A Horror-able Mess-terpiece,3,9 July 2018,"I wished I would have missed this train wreck because it was a slow moving, over dramatized, artsy-fartsy mess. I kept waiting for the film to get better, but it just kept getting worse. Thank God I bought a copy of this film on sale to watch at home and I didn't have to pay full price at the exorbitant theater ticket prices.I enjoy a good thriller/mystery but this film was a total mess. I give the film a generous 3 out of 10 rating only because I think the lead actress Emily Blunt did her best with a rotten screenplay. Mrs. Shullivan read the book and she felt that the book was also very convoluted. But why the producers cast a sole British actress to play the lead when the rest of the cast are all U.S. based actors residing in a major U.S. city, it just wreaks of a poor attempt to increase overseas ticket sales.If they made me watch it a second time I would have preferred to jump in front of the train instead.",The Girl on the Train
57,SAMTHEBESTEST,"An average thriller with unnecessary elements, scattered screenplay and disaster characters.",5,26 February 2021,"The Girl On The Train (2016) :
Brief Review -An average thriller with unnecessary elements, scattered screenplay and disaster characters. After hearing about the Bollywood remake of this film i decided to watch the original or can I say the first copy of the novel first so that the comparison would become fair. Not keeping high expectations has actually helpedme to bear this for 112 minutes, or else i might have used fast forward option many times during the watch. When you are making a Thriller you must make sure that it would have a suspense at the end which would worth the earlier set up, if not the entire narratives crumbles. The Girl On The Train could have easily been a good thriller if not very good or classic by using the necessary elements, instead it uses lots of unnecessary vulgar elements just to make it boring enough. To be frank now i feel like i am doing favour by calling it an Average film because if i watch it again i might even call it a Crap. The screenplay was such a mess, such a bore to handle in the first watch. I felt sleepy at least 5-6 times. Ok, let's say it clear and loud that it is not even a good thriller to be watched once then just forget that good rating you see on IMDb, it is not even half of it if seen with extra care. The story itself was ruined by disaster characters as if we should have felt sympathy about filthy characters? As if we should really cared about a wh**e or sl** whatever you call her, that goes missing, but for what? Those remaining two ladies were so dumb and pain in the a** i mean you couldn't even behave like an average brain and then decide to play smarty all of sudden, how? Somehow the climax survives because of completion and it feels like, oh yes finally it has ended, doesn't matter how but yes at least provides a dead end. Overall, a strictly average thriller, watch it only if have nothing else left.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest",The Girl on the Train

59,paul-allaer,"It's quite enjoyable but rarely ""edge of my seat"" compelling viewing",6,8 October 2016,"""The Girl On the Train"" (2016 release; 112 min.) brings the story of several women. As the movie opens, the screen simply announces ""Rachel"" and we see her commuting on the train from Ardsley-on-Hudson into Manhattan. She passes along a number of houses, fantasizing about the lives of the people that live there. Along the way, it's clear that Rachel is an alcoholic, with serious emotional baggage. The movie's next chapter is called ""Megan"", as we get to know the beautiful young woman who seems to have a darker side than we first believed. The movie's third chapter is ""Anna"", the woman who it turns out is married to Rachel's ex-husband Tom. At this point we're maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Tate Taylor, who all took us by surprise with the brilliant James Brown bio-pic ""Get On Up"" a few years ago. Here he transposes the novel of the same name onto the big screen. Apparently the novel (by Paula Hawkins) was a mega-seller. I haven't read it so I can't comment how closely the movie remains to the book, both as to the plot and the overall mood. (also, there is no connection whatsoever between this and the French 2009 movie of the same name, starring Catherine Deneuve.) Given the mystery-suspense nature of the movie, there isn't a whole lot that I want to say, so as not to spoil anything, so let me offer a couple of general observations. I found the movie quite similar in theme and spirit to ""Gone Girl"", a nicely produced mystery-drama that keeps you guessing for a while. Emily Blunt, sheer brilliance in last year's ""Sicario"", once again shines as the vulnerable Rachel. The other leading leading are quite fine too: Rebecca Ferguson as Anna, and Haley Bennett as Megan. Keep your eye out for Lisa ""Friends"" Kudrow in a small (10 min. screen time) role as Martha, the ex-colleague of Tom. and I quite enjoyed Allison Janney as a Police Detective. Yes indeed, plenty of acting talent in this movie! Last but not least, Danny Elfman provides a beautiful orchestral score for the movie.""The Girl On the Train"" opened wide this weekend, and the Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended poorly, much to my surprise (maybe 10 people in all). I had seen the trailer several times, and based on that alone, I couldn't wait to see this. While the movie is quite enjoyable, it rarely makes for ""edge of my seat"" compelling viewing, but that's obviously just my own subjective take on it, and I'd readily suggest that you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",The Girl on the Train
60,subxerogravity,Pretty suspenseful.,7,8 October 2016,"The story itself was pretty good. Just a series of tangle webs that just get more tangled as it goes along. Although half way through it, clues pop up, not out of nowhere, but suddenly and I already solved the mystery, but the suspense of finding out whether I'm right or not makes for an exciting picture.Plus it's very cool that a movie natural progresses to allow you to put the clues together rather than just having some montage at the end that suddenly fills in the gaps for you (though this move does have that, it's needless).Emily Blunt was great in this movie. Her portrait of an alcoholic was riveting. It had to be as the story was so focus on her characters view on all it, she had to be good.I definitely enjoined the film far more than I would expect.",The Girl on the Train
61,jtindahouse,A faithful adaption with a lot of quality,8,7 October 2016,"I've come to learn that there is nothing tougher than reviewing a film which you have already read the book of. It's especially tough in the instance of a mystery/thriller, where the story revolves around the 'whodunnit' aspect, and yet you already know the answer. I found much the same problem with 'Gone Girl'. The novel 'The Girl on the Train' was a sensation, selling in record numbers. It was a strong story undoubtedly, but I didn't find it as game-changing as some others seemed to. Also the trailers for this film didn't do much to entice me, so admittedly I wasn't overly excited about the release of this. Therefore it was a nice surprise when I found myself thoroughly enjoying the final product.Despite having already read the novel version of 'The Girl on the Train' I was still able to appreciate it and enjoy it. The first half is shot with a lot of style by director Tate Taylor, and then the second half focuses more on the story itself. It's a beautifully shot film at times. The acting performances are also impeccable from all concerned. Emily Blunt was unbelievable and even Oscar-worthy in certain scenes. Haley Bennett and Justin Theroux were also stand-outs. The intensity the cast brings to proceedings are where the strength of the film lies.It's a very bleak film in nature. There was only one moment in the entire film that raised a slight chuckle from a portion of the audience. Aside from that, the tone is entirely serious. It also stays very faithful to the book (with the exception of moving from London to New York), and rightly so. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's quite a rare case of the main protagonist having some pretty major issues, and to be honest, not even being particularly likable. And yet somehow we remain entirely on her side throughout. There's a lot to like here for both people who have read the book and people who haven't. It's a well-made and well-executed film that achieves what it sets out to.",The Girl on the Train
62,stevendbeard,Good Mystery/Thriller,7,7 October 2016,"I saw ""The Girl on the Train"", starring Emily Blunt-Into the Woods, The Adjustment Bureau; Justin Theroux-Zoolander 2, Miami Vice_2006; Haley Bennett-The Magnificent Seven_2016, The Equalizer and Allison Janney- Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children, The Duff.This is a nice little mystery/thriller. It's based on a book by Paula Hawkins. Emily plays a woman that is an alcoholic-she even looses her job-and she spends her days riding on a train that goes by the house she used to live in when she was married. Her ex-husband, Justin, still lives there with his new wife and baby. Haley plays Justin's nanny, that lives 2 doors down the street from him-FYI: Haley is a dead ringer for Jennifer Lawrence, what with her blonde hair and facial features. I did a double take when I first saw her in the trailer. Anyway, when Emily is checking out how her ex-husband is doing-you know, peeping-toming him from the train-she notices Haley and how happy she seems to be with her husband at their house. One day, Emily sees Haley with a different man on their porch and they are kissing. Haley goes into a full blown rage- she is still upset about loosing her own husband and can not understand how someone else would risk loosing their husband over something stupid, like an affair. Haley gets well past drunk, wakes up the next morning with no memory of what happened the night before, and is covered in cuts and bruises. She then finds out that Haley has gone missing. Did Emily do something? She can't remember. That is when Allison shows up as a detective, investigating Haley's disappearance. Then, things get even better, when they find out what really happened to Halley. The only problem I had with the movie was the way it jumped around, timewise. One minute, it is in the present, then it is flashbacking. It just took some concentrating to keep the story straight. But it was worth the effort. There was a couple of cameos of note; I remember seeing Laura Prepon and Lisa Kudrow. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",The Girl on the Train
63,meeza,Blunt power!,7,7 April 2017,"Director Tate Taylor went down a taylor-made cinematic arena and took an auteur ride with ""The Girl on the Train"". The movie stars a fantastic Emily Blunt as Rachel; a lonely, depressed, and alcoholic woman who rides a train everyday that passes by the house she used to reside with her ex-husband Tom. A few houses down, there is another house Rachel fixates with, it's one of a blonde woman named Megan who appears to be happily married to her husband. But Rachel is literally a trainwreck due to her lushing ways, and when she sees one day (obviously from the train) that Megan might be having an affair, Rachel goes more off her rockers but not off her Johnnie Walkers. What follows on ""The Girl from The Train"" I will leave for you to get on track with. Taylor does provide some twists & turns in this psychological thriller, but nothing that will shock you. The up-and-coming Haley Bennett does impressive work as Megan, and Rachel Ferguson was quite steady as Tom's new wife Anna. The rest of the supporting cast including Justin Theroux, Luke Evans, Edgar Ramirez, and Allison Janney needed more ""train""ing for this one. But to put it bluntly, it was Emily Blunt's ""on the right track"" performance that made this movie watchable. So don't miss your stop for ""The Girl on the Train"", but if you do, it's not the end of the world. *** Average",The Girl on the Train
64,robfollower,The Girl on the Train(2016),8,10 November 2020,"The Girl on the Train is based on Paula Hawkins' bestselling thriller that shocked the world. Rachel (Emily Blunt), devastated by her recent divorce, spends her daily commute fantasizing about the seemingly perfect couple who live in a house that her train passes every day. Everything changes when she sees something shocking happen there, and becomes entangled in the mystery that unfolds.I enjoyed how compelling the story and characters were. The characters, while unlikable, were well developed, which is hard to do when you use multiple narratives. Emily Blunt gives a career defining performance as Rachel, she plays the perpetually drunken Rachel with a believable fatigue and stupor that reinforces her as an ""unreliable witness"" allowing us to connect and even sympathize with her deeply flawed protagonist. The supporting cast of seasoned Hollywood role players all perform admirably in their roles, and Allison Janney in particular shines as a detective who is skeptical of Rachel's testimony.This film feature excellent screenwriting, acting, directing, cinematography, and set decoration. This was a blind buy for me. When Emily Blunt is in a film it is a good bet the film will not disappoint . Emily really shine through; one of Blunt's best performances. You are not going to find to many other films that has the emotional range as this film. It will completely draw you in. Excellent film and addition to my collection.",The Girl on the Train
65,st-shot,Train derails fast.,5,10 December 2016,"I've not read or heard of the book (which is good in a way) but The Girl on the Train chugs along the tracks on the thinnest of plots with as much dependence as Falconetti in Jeane de Arc on the face of protagonist Emily Blunt as a disturbed divorcée to carry nearly the entire weight of the picture. Blunt feints and jabs to keep the picture interesting but the paper thin scenario simply overwhelms her.Addled divorcée Rachel Watson takes the train to work past her former home where the ex still lives with his new wife. She also takes note of the house a few yards down envying their perceived idealistic marriage. Soon she's prowling the neighborhood freaking people out, then someone disappears. Allison Janney looking stiff and ill prepared as a detective leads a dull and hyper supporting cast (along with Ms. Blunt at times) that only deserves mention to lay blame upon while Director Tate Taylor does extensive CPR with some flashy editing, distractions and turgid slow mo. It is up to Blunt however to bring this dog home with her tortured close-ups, crashing through passenger cars and creeping out folks to keep this drab diesel on a precarious track before Taylor runs out of tricks and distractions and the whole film derails in deep disappointment.",The Girl on the Train
66,parry_na,Fascinating adaption.,7,10 May 2018,"Ah, the private torment of the 'secret' alcoholic - which really isn't a secret at all, which makes things even worse, and has you reaching for the Vodka. Emily Blunt is excellent as Rachel Watson, the main character, in this terrific adaption of Paula Hawkins' successful debut novel of the same name. The skin-crawling description of Watson's daily nightmare is recreated with equal relish here by director Tate Taylor. The moving of events from recognisable English suburbia to America works a lot better than I had anticipated, helped by a cast of actors from both sides of the Atlantic.Happily, Blunt's excellence does not exist in isolation. The ex-husband, the other woman, the other other woman, her ex and the splendid DS Riley (Allison Janney) all utterly convince as a nest of truly flawed characters. Their rough edges keep things interesting and stop events ever sinking into the melodrama they might otherwise have done. Watson's hapless stumbling leads her into and out of trouble, her condition never allowing us to take too seriously any of her wilder accusations. Which is interesting, as some of them may be true ...A fascinating drama then, beautifully shot, both as an adaption and in its own right.",The Girl on the Train
67,alindsay-al,An average thriller that is pretty dull,5,10 October 2016,"I saw some of the talent in this film and I was excited for this film and the girl on the train is unfortunately a well acted but overall dull film. The premise of this film sees a depressed woman ride the train everyday and creates stories out of the people she sees in houses. When a missing persons report is possibly linked to her she investigates. Emily blunt plays rachel 'the girl on the train' and she does a great job in this film. She isn't the action star from edge of tomorrow in this film she is a damaged quite crazy character that you actually don't have lots of sympathy for. As the film progresses her character progresses and you end up caring about her mainly for blunts fantastic performance. Haley bennett plays megan the girl who is missing and she gives a great performance in this film, even though similarly to blunt her character is really flawed but you do care about her situation. Rebecca Ferguson plays anna who is married to Rachel's ex husband and she does a great job adding depth to this film and with her character. Luke evans plays scott, Megan's husband and he does a good job in the film as he tries to figure out what happened as he is investigated. Justin Theroux plays tom, Annie's husband and Rachel's ex and he delivers a good performance that is interesting to see how he develops with rachel and Annie in this film. The story is intriguing but I felt it moved so slowly and it doesn't feel like the payoff is that worth it. You have seen the majority of the story beats before and it does become a bit predictable. The script has some great drama in it that allows you to accept the grim situation that our characters are in. But I do wish there maybe could have been a little humour involved giving the ridiculousness of the whole situation. The style is pretty by the numbers that has been seen allot in the past. Its a very drab looking movie that lacks any colour and the pacing of this film is really slow which means your pretty bored by the time it gets a little interesting.

68,iquine,Felt Like A Violent Soap Opera,4,7 April 2018,"(Flash Review)This tried to be a clever psychological thriller with a non-linear timeline and was far from successful. The story seemed to drag and stumble over its own attempted cleverness. The girl, actually a grown woman, believes she sees some infidelity going on from people she knows while passing by their house while riding on a train. She gets involved. Or does she? She is also an hallucinating alcoholic stemming from her divorce so reality may not be what it may seem. Anyway, what is really going on with this potential love triangle that she believes is happening? While nicely shot and acted, the story and editing are hard to follow with a story that didn't really give the audience much chance to piece it together until the final act.

70,jimbo-53-186511,"Episodic, poorly paced and uninteresting for large portions of its running time",3,12 March 2017,"Divorcée and alcoholic Rachel (Emily Blunt) catches the train to New York each day and the route takes her right past her old house where her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) and his wife Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) are now living. Megan (Haley Bennett) lives in one of the neighbouring properties and Rachel notices Megan when she passes each day on the train. Megan goes missing but Rachel believes that she may know what has happened to her - although she was heavily intoxicated when she last saw Megan. Rachel frantically struggles to remember what happened to Megan and does her best to assist the authorities in their investigation.It's hard to imagine how a film that has so much intrigue and mystery 'on paper' at least could end up being so drab and boring?. If you want to know the answer to this question then you'd need to watch The Girl On The Train - although I'd strongly suggest that you take my word for it and not put yourself through any unnecessary pain.The first obvious problem with The Girl On The Train is its pacing and the general manner in which it is presented. Clearly, some time needs to be devoted to introduce the characters and determine how they fit into the story etc, but to me it felt as though the characters were introduced and then the narrative was on some kind of continuous loop - train journey, back to a character, train journey onto another character. It's all a bit tedious and episodic and I found that the film continually covered the same ground without ever really establishing any new ground. The characters themselves are bland, one-dimensional and generally unlikeable - even the protagonist is an alcoholic which doesn't exactly endear us towards her.The way the film is structured was also muddled and confusing and at times it was hard to know whose perspective the story was been told from. Even as a mystery film it never really gripped me as I didn't find any of the characters to be engaging or interesting and the convoluted way that the story was structured only help to increase my general disinterest in what was going on.There are a couple of good things about this film; 1) Emily Blunt - she was a class act here and was wholly believable as a dispirited alcoholic. 2) Things pick up in the final third, but this burst of energy still fails to make up for its numerous shortcomings and as it stands the repetitive and tedious narrative in the first two thirds of the film meant that as a whole the film was a bit too much of a strain on my patience.",The Girl on the Train

72,drownnnsoda,"Stellar acting and unique storytelling, but stylistically bland",7,9 October 2016,"I'll spare heavy-handed plot details for ""The Girl on the Train"" for the sake of not revealing anything, but the crux of it revolves around a hopeless drunkard (Emily Blunt) who inadvertently becomes enmeshed in a missing woman's case by means of her own personal obsessions.I have not read the book the film was based on, so I can't make any comparison between the two, which may be useful for those who want a bit more of an objective view of the film itself. First and foremost, where this film really excels is in its performances, chiefly from Emily Blunt and Haley Bennett, both of whom play individually troubled characters haunted by past turmoils that lurk just underneath bubbling surfaces. Blunt is extremely believable as the depressive alcoholic, and Bennett plays the role of young wife to the thirty-something man with a significant amount of nuance. The rest of the cast are also all believable; Justin Theroux and Luke Evans play divisive male counterparts, with Rebecca Ferguson as Blunt's marriage-bed replacement. Allison Janney, Laura Prepon, and Lisa Kudrow all have small supporting parts that are unexpected but significant.The narrative is absorbing in the sense that it fragments itself in order to provoke a sense of intrigue, and this is mostly successful and done with a sense of purpose. One of the film's major themes is projection and how we look to other people and not only make assumptions about them, but also how we find voyeuristic fulfillment in the very act itself. This is exemplified in Blunt's damaged character, who leads an empty life and attempts to fill it with fantasies and theories about relative strangers. The chasm between the truth and what we think we know as outsiders looking in is one of the biggest thematic concerns here, and the dispersed narrative approach coincides nicely with this.Where the film lacks significantly is its aesthetics. As many have noted, there is a quasi-""Lifetime movie of the week"" feel to the film, with uninspired dramatic slow-motion shots, and cinematography that feels very much by-the-book. It's not necessarily bad; it's just bland. Given the lurid material and twisty-and-turns narrative, the filmmakers could have had a heyday when it came to stylistics, but the film ultimately feels like a standard, run-of-the-mill TV thriller in that department. It's as though the weight of the narrative is not adequately represented on screen. Overall, ""The Girl on the Train"" is a solid film despite its stylistic flatness. Engaging performances from Blunt and Bennett help elevate the pulpy dimestore nature of the material, and the storytelling is consistently embroiling. More imagination in terms of presentation would have honestly put the film in another league, but the film is no less a satisfying, leisurely mystery. 7/10.",The Girl on the Train

74,kluseba,An overtly long and repetitive ride through sinister territories with interesting passengers,6,10 October 2016,"''The Girl on the Train'' is a psycho thriller in the key of but not as good as ''Gone Girl''. It's recommendable for genre fans but far from being a highlight.The movie deals with the disappearance of a nanny and is told through numerous changes of time, space and perspective. We constantly switch from the present to events that have happened a week, two months, four months, six months or even several years ago. Numerous parts of the film take place in recurring closed spaces such as an apartment, a house, a psychologist's office and a train. Most parts of the movie are told through the eyes of an alcoholic divorcée while other parts are told through the eyes of the mentally unstable nanny. Other parts are however told through a third person view from an omniscient narrator. These constant changes aren't forming a clever puzzle as in a movie like ''Memento'' but only harm the coherent flow of the film and evoke an illusion of diversity to compensate for a rather shallow plot. The only advantage of this procedure is that the movie is focusing on character development by giving some vital background information about the main characters. The disadvantage is not only that the structure is confusing but also that many mysteries are revealed too quickly. In the last third of the movie, it becomes so obvious what must have happened to the nanny that it drastically decreases the tension of an initially promising story.While the acting of all actresses and actors involved is really good, it's difficult for the audience to identify with any of the characters. Most of them are twisted, shameful and repulsive in one way or another. Most characters are either particularly dishonest or menacingly violent or even both in certain cases. While there are interesting things to discover about each character, it feels unrealistic, pessimistic and exaggerated how negative each main character behaves in this film. This might add to the movie's overall sinister mood that suits the genre but it also feels too simplistic and partial.Another weakness is that despite its numerous changes of time, space and perspective, many parts of the movie are repetitive and predictable. The middle part of the film is particularly slow-paced. In the beginning, it's still intriguing to see the helpless alcoholic divorcée having a breakdown or the fragile nanny having a meltdown when confronted with her emotions but when these things are happening for the third or fourth time, these scenes lose their initial efficiency despite great acting performances by Emily Blunt and Haley Bennett.In the end, what kept me watching this movie until the end are its sinister mood and the great performances by Emily Blunt and Haley Bennett. The below average plot and repetitive storytelling patterns are the downsides of this film. My recommendation would be to read the critically acclaimed novel of the same name instead of watching this slightly above average film.",The Girl on the Train

The movie can be slow for some people, but in my case, it kept me hooked as its way of putting the pieces of the puzzle together was compelling, some quick flashback shots were explained throughout the movie, especially in the third act, and it all concluded in a bloody twist ending.",The Girl on the Train

Yet, if you give this film a chance, you will come to see this is, in fact, a delicately crafted film.Pieces that don't fit, have, in fact, been cleverly placed to mislead and distract. Its a film that will have you looking at things from different perspectives and each time, reaching different conclusions.

They also happen to be her ex-hubby Tom next door neighbours, who moved in after Rachel and Tom divorced.While Tom is presently settled with ex mistress, now official second wife Anna, Rachel is reaching rock bottom, often hanging around her previous house in drunken despair. Having discovered that Megan is unfaithful to her husband, in a fit of drunken rage Rachel decides to take the matter in her hands. The plot is based on Rachel black-out of the events leading to Megan disappearance and the ensuing investigation.In cases as this, the husband is always the first suspect, his movements and alibi being checked ASAP. However, in the movie it looks like the idea of checking on Scott comes only as an afterthought, because it makes so much more sense that a complete stranger like Rachel might have done the did for absolutely no reason whatsoever...I am not revealing any plot twist, because the final one is quite predictable. The lackluster performance of ""Girl on a train"" is probably due to many factors, such as the theme of maternity hammered in at every chance; the many gratuitous sex scenes; the nastiness of all characters and the lack of real tension.PS an alternative title could have been ""All women obsessed with reproductive challenges, all men jerks""",The Girl on the Train
79,TheOneThatYouWanted,A... comedy?,6,1 December 2016,"Alright then. No spoilers here. I can see why this film tanked. It comes from excellent source material, as we finally get to learn from the final 20 minutes of the film. The problem is either the director or Emily Blunt's acting. Emily Blunt is an Oscar caliber actress, so I can not wrap my head around why her portrayal of an emotionally racked alcoholic woman is so comical. I was literally laughing every time she was on scene; and that isn't a good thing when it comes to the overarching dramatic story. I'm not sure if Blunt just doesn't have the acting chops to pull off a pathetic drunk without making it too goofy or if the director instructed her to play the character that way but it totally did not work. Sure, I had fun laughing at Blunt acting goofy but takes away from the story once we are given the complete story.",The Girl on the Train
80,jadepietro,Derailed,6,11 October 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A great performance by Emily Blunt makes this ride somewhat  worthwhile.  GRADE: C+  SYNOPSIS: An alcoholic woman puts a mass of confusion into play for two  couples and herself in this mystery thriller.  JIM'S REVIEW: The lady vanishes. This disappearing act has been around  in the murder mystery genre for decades with varying results. One of  the most satisfying examples in recent years was David Fincher's Gone  Girl (2014). Comparisons to that vastly superior film are unavoidable  when viewing The Girl on the Train, its similarities in plot and  narrative structure are striking. That film was a terrific murder  mystery that had compelling characters, a intricate plot, and multiple  viewpoints to tell its tale as it intertwined sex and violence  involving a missing person scenario. It also had taut direction, a  literate screenplay, and accomplished acting. Tate Taylor's The Girl on  the Train only has 1 out of 3 aspects (the last one). This film takes a  similar route in its telling, complete with various narrators as well,  and while it never reaches the level of excellence of the earlier film  in its story-line, it is still compelling entertainment, due entirely  to a superb performance by Emily Blunt in the title role.  ￼Ms. Blunt plays Rachel, a boozy commuter who takes the Metro North  daily to stalk her former husband, Tom (Justin Theroux) and his lovely  wife and her replacement, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson). She knows this  idolized suburbia well, as she fantasizes about the perfect couple down  the lane on her daily routine trips: hunky Scott (Luke Evans) and his  drop dead gorgeous wife, Megan (Haley Bennett). (In fact, everyone in  this movie has better bones and structure than the movie itself.)   One day, it is Megan that Rachel sees with a tall dark stranger on one  of her many treks and it is Megan who goes missing. Rachel, in one of  her alcohol-induced stupors, notifies the police and her eyewitness  account comes into question. So does Rachel's bloody attire and lack of  memory about this incident. The plot thickens as your patience begins  to wane, with more and more ill-conceived complications added to the  mystery.  ￼Based on Paula Hawkins' popular novel, the film sets up its plot  devices before it derails at the halfway point in the film. This is due  primarily to Mr.Taylor's lackluster direction and Erin Cressida  Wilson's muddled script. The film's structure of flashbacks and  flash-forwards never is cohesive and leaps of logic abound as the film  progresses to a melodramatic and stilted conclusion.  The cast is solid throughout, although some of their character's  inter-relationships with Rachel strain credibility and their actions  are mere plot devices that make little sense in retrospect. Especially  suspect is Rachel and Scott's scenes together...as if some important  scenes and exposition lay on the cutting room floor.  ￼What gives the film some gravitas is Mr. Blunt's excellent performance  as our alcoholic heroine. She immediately hones in on the slight  tremors and dazed look of a woman lost in a drunken state. Her  desperation and sadness is masterfully delivered. The actress deserves  better. Also making a strong impression are Mr. Theroux as her  ex-husband and Ms. Bennett as the gone girl. Lost in transition are  other cast members like Allison Janney, Lisa Kudrow, and Edgar Ramirez  who are wasted in poorly developed roles.  ￼With all its twists and turns, The Girl on the Train never connects.  If not for the talented Ms Blunt's acting prowess, this trip would have  been one long tedious ride to nowhere.",The Girl on the Train
81,rgkarim,Girl Who's In Pain: A Convoluted Drama!,7,7 October 2016,"Drama, it's a category that sells like hotcakes in the entertainment field. Soap operas have been abusing this genre for years, and this weekend another big budget blockbuster will attempt to capitalize on affairs and deceit. I'm talking about Girl on a Train, another book turned movie that looks to be a mirror of Gone Girl from a few years past. Does this movie hold true potential for suspense, or is it just old hat tricks? Robbie K here, hoping to provide some insight into those questions.LIKES: Wonderful Cast  Delivers promised drama  A decent mysteryThis film's ensemble certainly deserves credit for bringing the tale to life. Emily Blunt leads the team off playing a part that was both emotional and complex. Blunt can portray pain well, bringing suffering out of the screen in a believable performance that seldom crosses into overacting territory. Her emotions are in good balance, fluidly transitioning between each mood to capture the crazy edge required by her character. Haley Bennett has less emotion to cover, but portrays depression quite realistically in terms of emotional bluntness seen in the disorder. As for Rebecca Ferguson, the third leading lady must have a jealous house wife inside of her, for she nails the distrustful nature down to the letter. While these ladies take center stage, the rest of the cast do justice to their roles and create a world fitting of the mystery thriller story. Speaking of story Girl on a train is a tale that is filled with promised drama and mystery, perfect components for a suspense/thriller. Our three""heroines"" for lack of a better world, weave complicated relationships within the city. Some are good and some are bad, but all are dramatic and over the top to hook you into the characters' lives. While I normally am annoyed by characters inability to let things go, this approach works for this film as it led to important character development while shedding light on the mystery at hand. As for the suspenseful mystery, it's not the most unique puzzle to grace the silver screen. However, it is one with many layers and depth that require you to pay attention in order to uncover the truth behind the alibis. it. Such depth added to the suspense and kept into the movie as I waited to find the light at the end of the dark tunnel. DISLIKES  Predictable ending  Convoluted presentation  Pointless scenes  Characters dropped at pointsHaving a mystery with many levels makes for a grasping tale, but sometimes getting too creative can be an issue. Girl on a train's presentation is a bit convoluted, as the tale integrates past with present via a series of intertwining. I'll admit it was an original presentation, but the flashbacks offset the momentum of the ship and sometimes transitioned back into the film so well you might have not realized you were back in the present. The result can be quite confusing and should you turn your attention away for a second, or go to the bathroom, you might become a bit lost. Fortunately, the ending is nicely wrapped up for you, but the rather predictable conclusion doesn't make this complicated presentation worth the trouble. Another dislike comes in the form of unnecessary scenes, primarily the ones involving sex. Call me whatever you want, but seeing forceful sex imposed on women, or seeing women seemingly bored with the art of making lust, does not make a good movie friends. I get it, sex sells as made evident by many films, and I will admit some major clues are dropped in these heated moments. Doesn't mean I need to be drowned in all the naked, groaning details in such a short time span. Needless to say, the film earns its R rating for something other than cussing and violence. Finally, some of the characters I feel got stiffed in this film. The trailers built up so many characters, but unfortunately they failed to deliver on some of them outside of dropping some key information before fading into the shadows. This hurt the movie in two ways. The first is these supposedly spooky characters fizzled out, weakening the suspense of the film and making for boring characters. Second by doing this, the mystery becomes much easier to solve and further sacrifices the thrilling ""surprise"" at the end. Don't worry though, you'll still get that drama you so crave, even if you can get the answer in thirty minutes. The VERDICT:Girl on a train certainly feels like a Gone Girl wannabe in terms of its dramatic atmosphere and complicated storytelling. Yet it still lacks some of the things that made its predecessor so good, including better editing, more suspenseful characters, and not having flashbacks run interference. Still it provides a good mystery to open the month up with the relationships many will sink their teeth into. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I can't say it is, but check this one out at home when you get the chance. My scores are: Mystery/Thriller: 7 Movie Overall: 6.5",The Girl on the Train
82,Matt_Layden,Completely Boring and Uninspired.,4,19 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train is one of the biggest selling debut novels ever, a book that was fast published to nip at the heels of the success of Flynn's Gone Girl. It makes sense that Hollywood would want to capitalize on this as well. The novel of The Girl on the Train will always be in Gone Girl's shadow, whether it's warranted or not and Tate Taylor's film suffers the same fate. Fincher had great success with Gone Girl, Taylor doesn't do the book justice and the book isn't even that great.Rachel takes a train to and from New York everyday. While on her commute she always notices one couple from one house, this is Scott and Megan. She's never met them, but she likes to make up imaginary lives for them, thinking they are the perfect couple. One day, she sees Megan with another man and it turns her whole world upside down. Yet, can her judgement be trusted? She suffers from an addiction to alcohol, something she was driven to after her failed marriage with her husband Tom. Tom just so happens to live two houses down from Scott and Megan with his new wife and child, living in the same house Rachel use to live in. Things go from bad to worse when Megan goes missing and Rachel purposely inserts herself into the investigation to find out the truth. There seems to be a lot going on by this description, but truth be told, the film fails to have any of it be interesting. You'd think that a mystery of a girl gone missing and having an unreliable narrator make for some suspense, but Taylor never creates any. The film feels hollow at its core and unfortunately it never manages to be what it tries so hard to be, which is a successful thriller. I ask myself, at what point was this film suspenseful? All of it is held until the last ten minutes, the reveal if you will, even then it's a fizzle. The biggest problem with the film is how boring it is. I'm watching this film from a viewpoint of a reader from the book. Yet I can't help but feel that if I hadn't read the book, that the reveal at the end would still be a predictable slug. The viewer gets to the ending well before the film does and you are sitting there just waiting for this film to catch up. There are numerous ""suspects"" in the film and it wants you to believe in every single one of them, but anyone who watches a film knows that none of these people will turn out to be responsible. The book is told from 3 perspectives, Rachel, Megan and Anna, who is Tom's new wife. The film tries to juggle these perspectives throughout the almost 2 hour running time and not surprisingly is fumbles. Rachel, played by Emily Blunt is clearly the main focus. Megan, played by Haley Bennett, my favourite performance, has her story mostly told through flashbacks. Finally there is Anna, played by Rebecca Ferguson, whom I didn't even recognize until I started writing this review, is given the least amount of things to do. On the other side of things we have Justin Theroux, Luke Evans and Edgar Ramirez as the three supporting male characters. Theroux is the perfect husband on the outside, but could possibly be hiding something sinister underneath. Evans is the husband of the missing woman, a man with anger issues and abuse claims. The look of him is intimidating enough for some and finally Ramirez as Megan's therapist with questionable morals. Each performance, while fine, serves the role written on the paper and none stand out beyond the page. The one performance in the whole film that goes above and beyond may be Blunt's, to the point of annoyance. Rachel is a drunk and Blunt goes for broke with her ""drunk"" performance. I really hated the character of Rachel in the books and Blunt does nothing to really win me over with the performance in the film either. The film doesn't faulted because of the performances, those are fine for the most part. It suffers from the direction. Taylor does absolutely nothing to make the film memorable, to make it look enticing, to make it worth watching. The film bored me and I don't really get bored during films. Taylor does nothing to make me care for the mystery at the core of this story. I really wanted this film to be good, to be suspenseful and work as an adult thriller. It fails to do those things and it's one of the bigger disappointments of the year.",The Girl on the Train
83,pc95,Entertaining Mystery,7,17 February 2017,"(Big Spoilers) Directed smoothly by Tate Taylor, mystery/suspense movie ""The Girl on the Train"" doesn't break any originality margins, but it nicely entertains. In the jig-saw puzzle style, Taylor has Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett, and Rebecca Ferguson in a trio of decent performances. The story could be a bit overlong, and somewhat far-fetched in some character reactions and scenes, but I enjoyed the old-school mystery. You have to swallow disbelief in the idea that Blunt's character juxtaposes her recollections of how she acts. Alcohol is a ready-made explanation for this, but anyway, if you're looking to poke holes in the story, you could. And sometimes movies don't deserve the benefit of the doubt, but I found it more fun to just watch this one. 7/10",The Girl on the Train
84,begob,Stylish,7,29 May 2017,"A hopeless drunk interferes with the family of her ex-husband, then a beautiful neighbour goes missing and the secret lies in a drunken blackout.Superior murder mystery with strong performances. This is quite bleak, with every character flawed by some degree of deception or weakness, and the mood is grim without the flamboyance of a film noir. The pace is steady, and everything clicks into place as the climax is ushered in through flashbacks. About halfway through I was comparing it to The Dead Girl, but it didn't maintain the quality.The outstanding element is the lead actress playing a really pitiful drunk who seems doomed to waste her life away - really depressing, with all those gloopy-eyed close ups. Other cast members are good, although it's a mystery why Laura Prepon took such a small role.Music is gloomy and clinical, reminded me of the theme to House Of Cards. Photography is crisp, and the direction tells the story well.Overall: conventional story told with style.",The Girl on the Train
85,bkrauser-81-311064,A Little More Than a Mimic of Gone Girl,7,11 October 2016,"I feel the need to defend this film a little bit (not a lot just a little). Story-wise it has the same bemusing melodramatic tone, shifts in perspective and twist-turny moments that set the foundation for Gone Girl's (2014) moody atmospherics. Much like that film, our leads, a triumvirate of Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson, do very well as sympathetic characters audiences are willing to hang their coat and hat on for two hours. The editing shuttles back and forth in time, patching in layers of information to give us conclusions where it once was hazy. So what's actually missing here?As you would imagine, the film begins with a girl on a train. The girl is Rachel (Blunt), an unemployed, severe alcoholic, who watches from the third car of the Manhattan bound train as the trees and nearby houses fly by. She seems keen on one such house, one belonging to the lovely Megan (Bennett) and her muscular beau Scott (Evans). She imagines them a young couple in love living in marital bliss, unaware that Megan is, in-fact a frustrated former art gallery assistant who babysits for our third protagonist Anna (Ferguson) and her husband Tom (Theroux). Completing the social circle, we're soon made aware that Rachel was once married to Tom...a fact made painfully aware when Megan winds up missing and Rachel becomes suspect #1.The Girl on a Train coyly treads lightly while introducing us to all of the story's moving parts. The seed of suspicion are planted in nearly everyone involved, including our main audience conduit Rachel, who suffers from episodes of blackouts. Even Megan, whom we've come to know as free-spirited and oversexed, gives us the impression that her disappearance is her merely wanting escape. With so many balls in the air, the film is poised to keep us just that much in the dark until plot-points finally chime in.This is either a sign of a great mystery or a movie hiding the fact that it has little to say. Those suspicions are certainly not helped by Rachel's constant memory lapses which disappear only when the story need them to. Once of course we get into the final act, everything is made clear not by virtue of a collage-like narrative or clever visual foreshadowing but because Rachel suddenly remembers something which holds the key to everything.As Rachel, Blunt deserves accolades for her portrayal of the ultimate victim in a plot dominated by characters who despise her. Her character arc, (a salvation through fortitude-type conclusion) fails to really gel with the film's machinations. But at least through her, it has the appearance of being earned. There are times I really wished there was more to her; a pulpy anti-hero angle just this side of Ray Milland from The Lost Weekend (1945). Unfortunately because she has to share screen time with the two other main women, not to mention a host of nefarious men, all we get is an alcoholic who'd only get better if she stopped playing into the ""crazy ex"" cliché.Thankfully this film is trying to say something more than just ""here's a good yarn"". There's been a bevy of new ""women's films"" over the last few years that stretch out of genre comfort zones to tackle worthwhile themes. Themes as current as workplace discrimination (Equity (2016)), body-shaming (Spy (2015)) and misogyny (Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)). While I don't think shining the light on physical and emotional abuse excuses this particular film's many shortcomings; those teetering on whether or not they should see Girl on the Train may see a selling point here.As far as movie adaptations of mystery novels, written by women, loaded with red herrings, tinged with pop-psychology, brimming with unreliable narrators, jumps in time and an overall cynical view on love, Gone Girl is a much better film. Yet don't count out Girl on the Train simply because it's always painted with the same brush. There's a little something more to this film than it being just a mimic.",The Girl on the Train
86,tomsview,Spotting from a train,8,24 February 2017,"I suppose if I'd read the book first there would not have been too many surprises left when I saw the movie, but I didn't and I enjoyed every twist and turn; especially the revelation at the end.Trains used to be front and centre in mystery movies in the 1930's, 40's and 50's – Alfred Hitchcock got a lot of mileage out of them (pardon the pun), but we haven't seen that much of them of late. It's another unexpected element that adds to this intriguing film.The story starts as Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) observes two couples from the window of the train during her daily commute to New York. When she notices something different with one of the couples, she becomes involved in a way that reveals secrets in all their lives. I wouldn't spoil it for those who haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, but suffice to say that this is a film that goes in unexpected directions.Emily blunt is an interesting actress. She has a warm, approachable look, almost like someone you've met; but whatever her secret, it allows her to melt into her roles. We believe her character from the beginning.""The Girl on the Train"" is one of those 'is it real or is it imagined' movies. Films that do that often cheat outrageously on the logic, but ""The Girl on the Train"" doesn't do that – not too much anyway.The film is full of beautiful looking people, it's a movie after all, and has powerful performances by two other women in the cast: Rebecca Ferguson and Hayley Bennett – with a dazzling and vulnerable performance by Bennett. That her co-stars don't overshadow her shows how good Emily Blunt is.Just when you could be forgiven for thinking that the hundreds of series and movies on TV and cable would have absorbed all the original material there was in the mystery category, ""The Girl on the Train"" comes along to show that clever writers and filmmakers will always find a fresh approach to a well-worn genre.",The Girl on the Train

Women these days never really seem to know what they want and when they get what they want they change their minds - a bit like this movie.It was well directed and Emily Blunt was superb as usual but it was too easy to figure out and the feminist claptrap left me cold!I figured out who the killer was after 30 minutes and if you can do that then that shows the movie for what it is. No, not in this one - although Emily Blunt is superb as always she just cannot make up for what is a pretty boring, lifeless script and the seemingly ever prevalent feminist bash at men - is it just me or are you finding this constant man-bashing in movies a bit of a bore.Men are from Venus and women are definitely from Mars if this movie is anything to go by!",The Girl on the Train

You have to read half of the 500 pages before there is proof of a crime. If you like lots of voice-over and shots of people sitting on a train looking out the window then this is the movie for you. Some drunk chick stumbling around trying to uncover a mystery like an alcoholic Nancy Drew with a bad hangover is how I would describe this mess.On the other hand, if you are the type of person who needs something in the way of character development, story, and pacing then you may want to avoid this movie and definitely take a pass on the book.",The Girl on the Train
90,Troy_Campbell,Pulpy fun.,6,6 October 2016,"As the latest paranoid thriller steeped in psychosis and twisted relationships, the comparisons with the far superior Gone Girl are unfortunately inevitable, but throw them aside and there's some pulpy fun to be had. Adapted from Paula Hawkins' best-selling novel of the same name, the non-linear plot is a complex web of lies and deceit with numerous untrustworthy perspectives taking the story in every which direction, often for no discernible reason. The information is slowly drip-fed in order to shed new light on past actions but occasionally the misdirection feels unnecessary, whilst the central conceit of Emily Blunt's eponymous train-rider's 'black outs' sometimes plays a little too conveniently. Yet there are twists and turns that genuinely shock (for those who haven't read the book), and the sparingly utilised bouts of sudden brutality – an intense reminder this movie is MA15+ for a good reason – are impactful. The collection of enigmatic characters is a mixed bag in way of development, with Blunt's ugly drunk Rachel and Haley Bennett's depressed suburban housewife Megan the only ones given worthwhile backstories and motivation. Yet the incredibly talented cast elevate their scenes where possible: Justin Theroux is likable as Rachel's frustrated ex-husband, Luke Evans is potent as Megan's jealous spouse, and Allison Janney brings her usual spice to a small detective role. Director Tate Taylor has simultaneously failed and succeeded with The Girl on the Train, it's not the heavy hitting A-grade thriller he was aiming for, yet it's a largely entertaining made-for-TV movie that finds itself on the big screen.",The Girl on the Train
91,seymourblack-1,A Compelling Psychological Thriller,8,31 January 2018,"A fragmented flashback structure and an unreliable narrator are jointly used to describe the context within which a brutal murder takes place in this compelling psychological thriller. The device works well in making the mystery at the heart of its story far more intriguing than it would otherwise be and also reflects the sense of confusion and disorientation that play such an important part in the daily life of the main protagonist. Her inability to rely on the veracity of her own perceptions and memories is particularly troubling and the emotional pain and instability that she suffers as a consequence becomes increasingly hard to bear.Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) is a depressed divorcee who regularly commutes by train between Ardsley-on-Hudson and Manhattan and routinely gazes out of her carriage window at the house where she used to live with her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) who now lives there with his new wife, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson). Rachel feels huge resentment against the woman who was having an affair with Tom when they were still married and is now the mother of his baby daughter. Rachel had been unable to conceive during her marriage to Tom and the despair that she suffered as a consequence had been instrumental in her becoming an alcoholic. Just a few doors along from Tom's house live Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) and her husband Scott (Luke Evans). Rachel sees them as a really perfect young couple and imagines that they must live a perfect life together.Rachel's bitterness against Tom and Anna manifests in some unpleasant ways which result in Anna living in fear of her and coming to the conclusion that she's unhinged. One day when she sees Megan on the balcony of her house hugging a man who isn't her husband, Rachel becomes incensed and in an alcohol-fuelled state, decides to confront the woman who she doesn't realize has also been employed by Tom as his daughter's nanny. Rachel has a blackout and wakes up back at her apartment covered in blood and bruises and subsequently learns that Megan has disappeared and that she's suspected of being involved.In the days that follow, Rachel tries to recall what happened on the night of her blackout and makes her own investigations into the circumstances surrounding Megan's disappearance and subsequent violent death. She makes only limited progress until one day on the train when she meets the wife of Tom's former boss and something that Martha (Lisa Kudrow) tells her proves to be the key to unlocking the mystery surrounding Megan's death.Based on Paula Hawkins' best selling novel of the same name, ""The Girl on the Train"" is consistently interesting to watch and understandably became a great commercial success. The three main female characters are all damaged in various ways by the treatment they've suffered from the men in their lives and issues to do with babies and the two main male characters are both controlling and abusive in different ways.

Sad to say I think a lot of things did go wrong here. This was quite a messy film in all honesty and a big disappointment. The film may resonate well with fans of the book, so my review is from the eyes of a film watcher solely.The film is about an extremely disheveled woman (who also happens to be a blithering drunk) who watches a seemingly perfect couple in a house outside where her daily train stops. She is envious of Megan Hipwell, the woman who lives in that house. Oddly enough that woman lives in the house next to her former boyfriend (who has started a new family with another woman). In her drunken states she makes unwanted calls and visits to her ex's house. One day, Megan Hipwell disappears and the cause of her disappearance leads back to one of the people who are introduced in the film. But who is it? Sound confusing? It kind of is when you have to keep thinking of what is happening where. Like the protagonist, this film is a mess.Flashbacks are okay if done in a clean and coherent manner. This film keeps doing messy flashbacks to different stages, that it becomes a chore to keep up with the different story lines of the characters. Speaking of the characters, they are all unlikable. The protagonist is not someone I can identify with and she becomes a tiring figure as the film goes by. After a while, I got sick of seeing her character in the same zoomed in shot with a confused crying face. You can't connect with Megan Hipwell because she's having relationships with multiple people. Not judging her character but she's so fleeting and doesn't connect or commit to anyone, so not sure why we would to her. Other characters just come into play as a plot device (Lisa Kudrow's character) and others just fade away completely (Laura Prepon).I'm not sure how the book was written but I sure hope the twists and reveals were written better than they are adapted onto the screen. All of the thrills feel cheap and the film becomes a task to keep up with for a while, that you find it hard to care after a while. I think the main character is also a bit of an idiot at a certain point of this film but its hard to go into that without spoiling the film. I have to say, I was greatly disappointed by this film because I was expecting a decent thriller. You just wish Emily Blunt had her eyes closed on the train the whole time, thus avoiding everything that happens in the film.5.5/10",The Girl on the Train

100,RforFilm,"Dull, boring, and looking too much like a Pottery Barn catalog, The Girl on the Train comes off as bad soap opera",3,27 October 2016,"I'm sure that if I were to ask anyone, they'd talk about some fantasy where there want to help solve some big case and play detective like they did when they were children. I think what some people are getting at is they see a show like CSI or Hawaii Five-O and think that as long as they have a computer, they could find anything from a lost set of keys to a missing child. What TV doesn't show are the more mundane routines of police work, from the paper work to the long hours of doing nothing. When I tries the stakeouts on my family, I ended up sitting in the garage for hours, wondering how I ended up wasting this much time.I think the other reason people like to play Sherlock Holmes is that their always fascinated by other people's lives. The rise of social media has only made us more hungry for the secrets of what our neighbors do when were not reading up on their latest Instagram picture. So when someone goes missing in today's time, it almost seems more tragic for creepier reasons; we already feel closer to them then we really should, yet hope their found. The Girl on the Train considers a missing woman being sought out by someone with no true business of doing so.Rachael Watson (played by Emily Blunt) is a sad alcoholic who spends most of her time riding a New York train back and forth while obsessing over her now over marriage to Tom (played by Justin Theroux). Rachael's life now seems focused on Tom's new life with Anna (played by Rebecca Ferguson), the real estate agent that's now his new wife. She also watches Tom's neighbors, Scott (played by Luke Evans) and Megan Hipwell (played by Haley Bennett).When riding the train one day, Rachel witnesses Megan having an affair with her psychiatrist, Dr. Kamel Abdic (played by Édgar Ramírez), and immediately feels angry for this woman ruining a ""perfect"" marriage. When Rachael tries to confront her, she blacks out and wakes up hours later in her apartment. Megan ends up missing and detective sergeant Riley (played by Allison Janney) suspects Rachael due to her past erratic behavior. Wanting to clear her name, Rachael makes friends with Scott and tries to search for Megan herself, while trying to figure out what has been going on during her blackouts.The Girl on the Train has been advertised as the next Gone Girl type story (which I found totally overrated), so a lot of hype has been set up here. I'd be lying if I said I had little interest, so I was hoping for something interesting. Unfortunately, what were given is a boring, oddly directed soap opera that uses a lot of bad mystery clichés in an attempt to shock it's audience. I haven't read the acclaimed novel, so maybe a lot of the material here simply was better on paper.The best thing about the movie is the performances. Emily Blunt is pretty believable as this sad sack of an alcoholic, though she might have benefited from gaining a little weight to make her more frumpy. I liked both Luke Evans and Haley Bennett as this odd couple with the secrets of the story. So why am I not invested? The direction of Tate Taylor seems very monochrome and stiff, which tries to make the situation depressing, but without much emotion, feels more like a dark ad for a Pottery Barn catalog. Not to mention that while the outdoor and train scenes are staged alright, the houses seem too polished to seem like typical upper middle class families.I'll give this three missing peoples milk cartons out of ten. I feel bad giving this a bad review as you get a sense that these actors are trying to work with this dull material, but this story really needed a David Fincher or even a Scorsese to really make the plot even juicier. But if the people here are this stiff, then The Girl on the Train can skip this station and I'll wait for a better movie.",The Girl on the Train
101,tbills2,Emily Blunt is The Girl on the Train,6,2 April 2018,"How was Emily Blunt snubbed for her academy award nomination for this? In 2017 Meryl Streep was nominated for Florence Foster Jenkins, Ruth Negga for Loving, Emma Stone for La La Land, Natalie Portman for Jackie, and Isabelle Hubbert was nominated for Elle. Emily should have won. This is one of the better performances I've ever seen and no nomination? I love Emily Blunt. The Girl on the Train is twisty like some train tracks, darkly immersive during spouts like riding through tunnels on a train, and through and through way too boring like being on a long train ride but The Girl on the Train is ultimately belligerently gratifying by the happy end, like finally arriving at your desired destination.

102,Quietb-1,This train goes nowhere.,4,18 October 2016,"Emily Blunt carries this on her shoulders and will be nominated this award season. That's the good news for this overly flawed so called mystery thriller. There isn't much mystery except what they show you isn't at all what happened. A thriller should have something more thrilling then a slow moving train.The cinematography is too much in your face. Nearly every scene is too tight on a face. The music seemed more appropriate for a science fiction movie. The overkill of the killings were ridiculous and actually unintentionally funny. Even if you accept the too well know star as the police detective, the small Lisa Kudrow role was a distraction.Unlike the train, the movie goes off the tracks. Taylor it was over with the dead guy in the front yard. The statements to police in a murder case with no attorneys present would never happen. Add at least two more superfluous scenes before the voice over on the train just makes you want a fade out. On the fade out subject were those month and day title cards useful or just another poor choice distraction.If mostly crazy women male bashing is your idea of a good time, this movie is for you. Your time would be better spent watching any Hitchcock movie. ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a far better movie with a great use of a train.",The Girl on the Train
103,bankofmarquis,Dour and Sullen,6,7 October 2016,"To start off with, I loved the book that the motion picture THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is based on. I tore through it in just a few days and was intrigued by the multiple narrator story structure with one of the narrators being unreliable. What our heroine was relating in the story might not, necessarily, be what is going on. Plus, we saw the same scene from different viewpoints and this turned the book into a crackling thriller with a unique premise and I was excited to resolve the mystery and was sad to leave this world. Consequently, I was eager to see how this would translate to the big screen.Unfortunately, what has been captured is a dour and gloomy experience that made me wish for the mystery to be solved so I could leave this dark world. This film is grey and heavy with a slow deliberate pace, low key performances and accompanying musical score that takes it's sweet time peeling back the pieces with nary a bright or whimsical moment to break the tension/mood.Based on the bestseller by Paula HAWKINS, TGOTT tells the story of sad, alcoholic Rachel, who - on her daily commute - sees what she thinks of as the ideal couple. When the wife of the couple, Megan, goes missing, Rachel tries to help. This synopsis does not do justice to this story as there are twists and turns and surprises along the way.In the film, Emily Blunt does a wonderful job as Rachel. She captures the ""hot mess"" that she has become. Her alcoholism is getting the better of her. In a better film, there might even be Academy Award talk about this performance. Likewise, Haley Bennett captures the desire and longing of Megan, a woman who is hiding a secret. The third narrator of this group is Anna, played by Rebecca Ferguson. A more traditional and (compared to the other two) boring character, with a matching performance. When I read the book, I was captured by the intrigue and interestingness of these characters. When I see them on screen - as captured by director Tate Taylor (The Help), these women (and others) come across as dull, gloomy and sad. The excitement I felt was gone and was left with sullen and muted senses. The score, cinematography and pace of this film all add to this ennui and, consequently, when the mystery ratchets up, there is no real crackle or excitement to it.If you want a sparkling good mystery thriller, read the book. If you want dourness check out the film.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Girl on the Train
104,Anurag-Shetty,A dark & intense film.,10,16 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train is a movie, based on Paula Hawkins' novel of the same name. Rachel(Emily Blunt) is a divorced alcoholic. She loves taking the train to New York City. While on the train, Rachel fantasizes about a couple she watches from the train. She imagines that they have the perfect life. A major incident occurs, that gets her entangled in the couple's life. Now, it is up to Rachel to find out the truth as to what exactly happened, on the day of the incident. The Girl on the Train is a mind blowing movie. Director Tate Taylor has successfully brought, author Paula Hawkins' best-selling novel to the big screen. The suspense, growing feeling of dread & Rachel's deeper descent into oblivion, keeps the viewer glued to the film. The cinematography by Charlotte Bruus Christensen, perfectly captures New York City in all its glory. The music by Danny Elfman, enhances the ominous tone of the movie. The performances are the highlight of the film. Emily Blunt is a revelation, as Rachel. Blunt has spectacularly portrayed, all the mannerisms of an alcoholic. In fact Emily Blunt is so convincing as Rachel, that you might think she suffers from alcoholism in real life too. Haley Bennett is outstanding as Megan. Bennett shows her diverse acting ability since the role of Megan, is very different to her role in The Magnificent Seven(2016). Rebecca Ferguson is brilliant as Anna. Justin Theroux is fantastic as Tom. Luke Evans is excellent as Scott. Edgar Ramirez is great as Dr. Kamal Abdic. Allison Janney is superb as Detective Riley. Laura Prepon is good as Cathy. Lisa Kudrow is awesome as Martha. All in all, The Girl on the Train is a must watch for all thriller movie buffs. A word of caution though.

105,dave-mcclain,"""The Girl on the Train"" stacks up well against the similarly-themed ""Gone Girl"".",8,8 October 2016,"I rarely quote other movie reviewers. In fact, I generally go out of my way to avoid other reviews before I write mine. However, in researching the mystery film ""The Girl on the Train"" (R, 1:52), I read some thoughts about this movie on pluggedin.com that were so good, I just had to share ""Foreboding trios of women are found throughout ancient mythology and literature. In Shakespeare's 'Macbeth', three witches foretell the Scottish king's ultimately tragic future. In Greece, it was thought that the three Fates spun out the threads of human life—with Atrapos cutting the thread when the life was done. The three Graeae, or Gray Sisters, held great secrets  but shared just one eye among them. The three women at the heart of 'The Girl on the Train' are, perhaps, a little like the Gray Sisters. Each of them knows secrets and has secrets of her own. But each, in her own way, is blind. Those secrets, and that blindness, play into the mysterious tragedy that unfolds."" Okay. Now, I'll try to make my review as good as that intro.This movie, based on the 2015 No. 1 best-selling debut novel by British author Paula Hawkins, moves the action from London to New York, but otherwise follows the book very closely. The three women who drive the story are Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt), the troubled alcoholic of the film's title, Anna Watson (Rebecca Ferguson), the new wife of Rachel's ex-husband, Tom (Justin Theroux), and Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett), who is in a loving but sometimes tense marriage to a man named Scott Hipwell (Luke Evans) and is the nanny to Anna and Tom's infant daughter, Evie. Megan is an aspiring artist with a tragic past. She covers her pain by acting out sexually and even tries to seduce her therapist, Dr. Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez). Anna had been ""the other woman"" who broke up Tom's marriage to Rachel and then moved into the house which, as a real estate agent, she had helped Tom and Rachel pick out. For two years, Rachel has been staying in a spare bedroom of a friend named Cathy (Laura Prepon) and rides the train from Westchester County into New York City every work day. She obsessively sits where she can see the back of the house in which she used to live, when the train passes by her old neighborhood.Although the story is told through the experiences of those three main female characters, it focuses on Rachel, who sometimes narrates parts of the story, and we see the action play out in the present and through a series of flashbacks. Rachel's grief over the loss of her marriage dominates her thoughts and actions – and helps drive her almost constant drinking. She often calls her ex-husband and sometimes walks up and down her old street. She has even come by the house uninvited and once entered the home and picked up Evie because she ""just wanted to hold her"". When Rachel's daily commute takes her through her old neighborhood, besides looking longingly at her old house, she also begins to obsess about the activity she sees at another house on her street – the home of Megan and Scott Hipwell.When she sees Megan kissing another man on her back porch, Rachel becomes angry that that woman who seems to have the perfect life is apparently ""throwing it all away"". One day, Rachel gets off the train at her old stop and approaches Megan, whom she sees walking through a tunnel. Rachel then blacks out and can't remember what happens next, but she wakes up the following morning, covered with vomit and blood. The news reports that Megan has gone missing. Rachel's well-documented erratic behavior leads Detective Sgt. Riley (Allison Janey) to visit Rachel and question her about Megan's disappearance. Rachel proclaims her innocence and injects herself into the investigation, befriending Scott Hipwell and becoming a patient of Dr. Abdic, while misrepresenting herself to both men. Her actions have unexpected positive results in Rachel's life, but nothing is what it seems in this mystery.""The Girl on the Train"" is appropriately compared to ""Gone Girl"", another book by a new female author, which is about a woman's disappearance and was adapted into a movie. Both films employ creative story-telling and keep the audience guessing (if they haven't already read the book). Both films are excellent adaptations of their source material and cast in the title role an actress who gives a truly outstanding performance. Rosamund Pike got an Oscar nod for her role in 2014's ""Gone Girl"" and Emily Blunt deserves no less for ""The Girl on the Train"". My only real problem with the latter film is believing that every one of the characters tolerates Rachel's behavior as much as they do and that she hasn't suffered more serious repercussions for her actions. Otherwise, Erin Cressida Wilson's script adaptation is compelling and juicy and the direction of Tate Taylor (""The Help"") is taut. This movie entertains very effectively – and also carries important lessons about the dangers of dysfunctional relationships. ""A-""",The Girl on the Train
106,agmoldham,Nowhere near as good as the book,3,30 March 2017,"Not being an extensive reader it is somewhat unusual for me to have read a book before watching the movie adaptation. It was the case with The Girl on the Train and have to say that I found the book much more engaging than the movie. I suppose with a mystery that isn't that surprising as you already know the plot twists.One of the thing that works really well in the book is the UK setting. The whole basis of the story is very English in nature and hence works better in an English countryside. Having spent many hours gazing at the backs of houses whilst on trains the book a a very natural feel to it. It's a very English thing to do and one that really doesn't translate into American culture.Emily Blunt plays the central character of Rachel who travels on the train each day and imagines the lives that are being lived behind the houses on the side of the track. In particular she focuses on Megan and Scott who live very close to where she lived in better times. The acting and direction are fine, but there was no flare in the movie.If you have a choice of reading the book or watching the film, I'd definitely suggest reading the book. If you really hate reading then watch the movie, but don't expect anything too fantastic.",The Girl on the Train

Blunt's performance is truly the shining star of this movie as she stumbles around in a black out trying to contact her cheating ex-husband.Be prepared for plenty of shots of a train rolling through the woods of New York and past large houses. The couple that Rachel watches Megan and Scott Hipwell (Bennett and Evans) appear to have a wonderful life but there are much deeper griefs hidden beneath their seemingly prefect exterior.

108,jrarichards,Psychological thriller with not too much to commend it,6,16 March 2017,"Had I never seen a thriller of this kind before, I guess I would have appreciated Tate Taylor's slightly Hitchcockian-sounding and even looking ""The Girl on the Train"" more than I did. After all, there is nothing wrong with the acting here, and indeed we get a really quite hard-to-watch (which in this context means effective) role from Emily Blunt as Rachel Watson, whose touch of mental instability and problems with alcohol leave her more than likely to fall prey to self-doubt. It's neat enough how our first insights into Rachel suggest she is a normal, if sensitive, woman; how this later gives way to us writing her off as unstable and troublesome; how we then begin to see her in a more sympathetic light - as a victim, before passing through two further metamorphoses as the film progresses towards its end. That's a clever portrayal, and in the hands of an actress as talented as Blunt, we see something quite persuasive.But a problem here is that there are not really too many fellow cast members here to help her - and the film - along. And the film as a whole seems a bit lacklustre. It's not quite pretty enough, or scary enough, or different enough, or innovative enough to catch the eye, and the primary conclusion it builds to is that the wealthy upper middle-class have their problems, like the rest of us; but are also more than capable of bringing many a problem on themselves, particularly when they fall prey to a mix of unrestrained power-madness, greed and lust.If I could give this piece 6.5, rather than 6, I would do so.

109,bob-the-movie-man,You won't uncork a bottle of Malbec again without thinking of this film...,7,8 November 2016,"""The Girl on a Train"" is the film adaptation of the best-seller by Paula Hawkins, transported from the London suburbs to New York's Hastings-on- Hudson.It's actually rather a sordid story encompassing as it does alcoholism, murder, marital strife, deceit, sexual frustration, an historical tragedy and lashings and lashings of violence. Emily Blunt (""Sicario"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"") plays Rachel, a divorcée with an alcohol problem who escapes into an obsessive fantasy each day as she passes her former neighbourhood on her commute into the city. Ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux, ""Zoolander 2"") lives in her old house with his second wife Anna (Rebecca ""MI:5"" Ferguson) and new baby Evie. But her real fantasy rests with cheerleader- style young neighbour Megan (Haley Bennett) who is actually locked in a frustratingly child-free marriage (frustrating for him at least) with the controlling and unpredictable Scott (Luke Evans, ""The Hobbit""). A sixth party in this complex network is Megan's psychiatrist Dr Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez, ""Joy"").In pure Hitchcockian style Megan witnesses mere glimpses of events from her twice-daily train and from these pieces together stories that suitably feed her psychosis. When 'shit gets real' and a key character goes missing, Megan surfaces her suspicions and obsessions to the police investigation (led by Detective Riley, the ever-excellent Allison Janney from ""The West Wing"") and promptly makes herself suspect number one.Readers of the book will already be aware of the twists and turns of the story, so will watch the film from a different perspective than I did. (Despite my best intentions I never managed to read the book first).First up, you would have to say that Emily Blunt's performance is outstanding in an extremely challenging acting role. Every nuance of shame, confusion, grief, fear, doubt and anger is beautifully enacted: it would not be a surprise to see her gain her first Oscar nomination for this. All the other lead roles are also delivered with great professionalism, with Haley Bennett (a busy month for her, with ""The Magnificent Seven"" also out) being impressive and Rebecca Ferguson, one of my favourite current actresses, delivering another measured and delicate performance.The supporting roles are also effective, with Darren Goldstein as the somewhat creepy ""man in the suit"" and ""Friends"" star Lisa Kudrow popping up in an effective and pivotal role. The Screen Guild Awards have an excellent category for an Ensemble Cast in a Motion Picture, and it feels appropriate to nominate this cast for that award.So it's a blockbuster book with a roller-coaster story and a stellar cast, so what could go wrong? Well, something for sure. This is a case in point where I suspect it is easier to slowly peel back Rachel's lost memory with pages and imagination than it is with dodgy fuzzy images on a big screen. Although the film comes in at only 112 minutes, the pacing in places is too slow (the screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson takes its time) and director Tate Taylor (""The Help"") is no Hitchcock, or indeed a David Fincher (since the film has strong similarities to last year's ""Gone Girl"": when the action does happen it lacks style, with the violence being on the brutal side and leaving little to the imagination.It's by no means a bad film, and worth seeing for the acting performances alone.

111,bryank-04844,You may or may not want to ride this train.,5,23 January 2017,"I can certainly see the appeal of Paula Hawkins' first successful novel 'The Girl on the Train', which was released in 2015, and was fast-tracked and optioned into a major motion picture by Universal Pictures to come out this weekend. It has some deeply dark and layered characters and tackles a range of emotions and vices from alcoholism, abuse, and even a murder. It's a good story with a who-done-it angle that feels fresh and original. The problem here is that the film felt a bit rushed and lazy, which gave way to the very slow burn the film has and never quite stays on point with its many flashbacks and timing, often times showing the same scene several times. It just got tedious and redundant twenty minutes in and never stopped being overly dramatic with longing stares, tears, and silence.The film didn't have an easy flow or pace to it, which could be derived from Erin Cressida Wilson's (Secretary) screenplay, which has a certain motive of to find out who the killer is, but the journey to get there is just dull and boring. Director Tate Taylor (The Help, Get On Up) doesn't add anything striking to the camera-work, besides making certain scenes hazy and blurry, as to make us feel drunk the whole time, like our protagonist Rachel (Emily Blunt). There really just wasn't anything special about the way the film looked, as everything had a very gray or muted color palette, minus a couple of scenes inside Rachel's roommate's (Laura Prepon) house.If you're unfamiliar with the story here or haven't read the book, the story centers on Rachel (Blunt), who is recently divorced and has trouble with drinking. She takes the train to New York every morning for work, and on the way, she notices her old house where her husband (Justin Theroux) and new wife (Rebecca Ferguson) and kid live. Next door to them is her old neighbors, which are a young couple (Luke Evans and Haley Bennett) who seem very much in love. One day on the train, Rachel sees something out of the ordinary, which sets in motion the whole plot of the film. From here, Rachel tries to figure out and solve a murder to someone she knows.Again, this sounds good on paper, but was not executed well on film. Allison Janney shows up in a few scenes as a detective and plays the part very well. Also, Lisa Kudrow shows up for a few seconds and is probably my favorite character in the whole movie, but isn't given any time to do anything with. Blunt does a decent enough job here, but like every character in the film, besides the actors who get less than a few minutes of screen time, play their roles in a very melancholy way, which drives the film into dull territory, which makes for a very slow and dragged out 112 minute experience.Perhaps the most interesting part of the film was the score, which was done by Danny Elfman, who scores most of Tim Burton's films as well as some great animated TV Shows (The Simpsons, Futurama). You wouldn't know it was a Danny Elfman score though, as he brought something new to the soundtrack here that keeps things tense and off-beat.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!",The Girl on the Train
112,brankovranjkovic,Emily Blunt saves this from feeling like a made for TV movie,6,7 October 2016,"A dark film with a twisty plot, and a film that keeps you guessing. Sometimes I notice the audience ratios, and in this case there were mostly women at my screening, many who audibly gasped at the most horrific moments, of which there were a few. Not a terrible film but not a great film either, the only aspect saving this from looking like a 'made for TV movie' was the fantastic performance from Emily Blunt, she was much more convincing than any of the other actors. Very fitting that her character (recently divorced woman with a drink problem) should have dealt with the perpetrator with a cork-screw!

115,RussHog,Strong performance - weak finale,5,11 October 2016,This movie featured a very good performance from the lead actress - Emily Blunt. Her work is solid as a woman who struggles with mental health and alcoholism - and has had a black out - and wonders if she possibly murdered someone. She begins to investigate the crime - to investigate herself - and what she learns sheds insight into her past and that leads to the dramatic conclusion.The film has a few serious flaws. Characters appear whenever the plot needs them to be there. The film is more style than structure - it moves more like a poem or a dream - which is fine but it did not work for me. There is a therapist who may or may not be the killer - and the reversal with this character is just plain ridiculous. The villain - in the end - is weak - and it is not believable that they would be able to have such power over these people's lives. By the time the film is done - the mystery turned out to be pretty obvious and not really that shocking. Also - there is a very serious feminist message with this film that the end hits over the head a little too hard - and I like feminism but some of the metaphors explored in the final scene are a little over the top.Good for the work of the lead - but a weak mystery with a dull conclusion.,The Girl on the Train

I knew next to nothing going in about what this movie was about, which is probably the best way to go into this movie (so in this review I'm not going to discuss the plot at all, just how I felt about the movie - it's better this way). I knew Emily Blunt was in the movie and that it was based on a novel and that's really about this it. Despite all this, I actually liked this movie.Who hasn't observed strangers from a distance and imagined our own life stories for them? What if we got lost in our own imagined thoughts and turned them into a dangerous obsession? It's an interesting premise on which to base a story.The movie kept me guessing; it wasn't predictable. It had me feeling disturbed, engaged, sad, and cringing at the unfolding events. I guess this is exactly what you'd want from a mystery thriller.",The Girl on the Train
118,cardsrock,Very disappointing,5,14 April 2020,"I usually love thrillers like this, but sadly this film is nowhere near up to par with some of the best in its genre. This is a boring, mopey film with listless direction. The ""twist"" is very underwhelming and doesn't really amount to much. The flashback structure is frustrating and the narrative as a whole just ends up being unsatisfying. I will say Emily Blunt is excellent in the title role and does what can with the lackluster material she's given.",The Girl on the Train
119,CANpatbuck3664,Good Mystery and Solid Acting but It's Undone by Scattershot Filmmamking and Useless Red Herrings,5,5 February 2017,"This was supposed to be the next Gone Girl, or at least that's what I heard. I saw Gone Girl with a friend and was completely blown away by it. I heard about the comparison and even if it wasn't as good, I still wanted to see this. But I couldn't catch it in a theatre so I rented it. I can't hide how disappointed I was by this. I wouldn't call it awful or even bad but this wasn't anywhere close to a classic and I wouldn't recommend it, just check out the book instead.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Things are not going well for Rachel (Emily Blunt). She's unemployed (she was fired to due to her drinking), she's alone after being dumped by her husband Tom (Justin Theroux) and she can't let go of the past. She spends her days riding the train and dreaming up lives for the people she rides by everyday. The main object of her fantasies is a woman named Megan (Hayley Bennett) and her husband Scott (Luke Evans) who live a couple of doors down from where she used to. She tells us about how she believes they're the perfect couple and that they're the idealistic form of love. Her husband has got together with his mistress Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and they have a kid and live in her former house. She's gotten in trouble for stalking them and she almost kidnapped their child. One day, she stumbles off the train and in her drunken haze runs into a blonde woman (it looks approximately like Anna or Megan). She blacks out and wakes up in her house with a headache and blood allover her clothes.Depending on who you talk to about this film, they'll be telling you that Emily Blunt deserves an Oscar nomination for this movie. I wouldn't go that far but this movie has top shelf actors/actresses and they all do at minimum decent work. Blunt makes for a convincing lead and she holds up her end. This movie should help Haley Bennett keep climbing the ladder, she does a great job even though her character gets on your nerves. Rebecca Ferguson is okay, she wasn't bad but I was more impressed with her in Mission Impossible. The rest of the cast is kind of at the mercy of their characters. Luke Evans did a pretty good job, Edgar Ramirez was alright but Justin Theroux wasn't very effective. I can't explain why without spoiling too much. I was confused why Laura Prepon, Lisa Kudrow and Allison Janney were in this movie, they don't get the screen time that you think they would.I found the central premise of The Girl on the Train interesting. They create interesting characters, you want to know what happened to Megan and if Rachel had something to do with it. The movie also does a good job obscuring things from the viewer, you'll definitely be guessing till the reveal. The problem I had was that this movie is so all over the place, it's hard to follow along at all. From what I hear, this is partially due to the book which also follows multiple viewpoints. I also get that our main character is a drunk. I'm cool with that but I feel like they still could have done a better job establishing how the events in the movie were unfolding. There's a difference between being secretive and shoddy storytelling. I would have liked this movie better if it had been clearer on what was going on.The other problem with this movie is that while it's jumping around the time line, they introduce so many subplots and characters that end up having very little effect on the actual story. It really screwed with the movie's pacing, there were pretty long stretches where very little is happening and there was more than one time that I thought the movie was losing focus.I've been hard on this movie but I didn't even dislike it really. I just didn't get the hype around it and I felt like the final product was a little over managed. It failed to translate what was so great about the book. If people end up liking this, I don't have any problem with that. This just ending up being pretty average and I won't be revisiting it any time soon.",The Girl on the Train

I expected a tense thriller, but instead I got a mess of a script, characters I did not care about and a director who seemed like a pervert in the way he portrayed sex scenes and nudity for no valid reason.As others have said the actors did their best with this pathetic and confusing script and weird direction, but nothing can really save this movie.I am sure we will see it in the bargain baskets and pound shops before long.It does seem that whenever critics rave on about something, it is invariably rubbish.",The Girl on the Train
122,ronakkotian,Dull and devoid of tension,4,27 February 2021,"The premise of this film sounded interesting and could have very well been a captivating thriller but sadly the execution is disappointingThe Girl on the Train follows Rachel, a divorcee struggling with alcoholism who takes the train everyday and looks at people's lives through the window. One day she notices something shocking that leads her down a dark path.This film had so much potential to be great. The overall cast and stpry was intriguing but it managed to end up being a dull thriller devoid of any tension. The saving grace for this film are the performances. Emily Blunt delivers a strong performance of a woman dealing with alcoholism. There's a great amount of subtlety in her performance that made her character interesting and she really carried the film. Rebecca Ferguson, Haley Bennett, Allison Janney and Luke Evans were all pretty good in their roles as well but the script lets them down. There is simply not enough development given to these characters for me to really care about them. I also feel mixed on the dialogues. At times they were great and times where they were awful. The film was way too short considering the amount of characters and perspectives it was following. It should have been much more longer as there would be more time to develop the characters and therefore the themes as a whole.I did like the dark colour palette of the film as it felt suitable for the dark tone of the story. Tate Taylor's direction was not up to the mark. A thriller should be suspenseful and have tension throughout but this film had none of that. In fact it was pretty boring. Taylor made odd choices such as shooting scenes at a low frame rate. I don't understand the purpose behind that choice and it didn't feel fitting for the film. I think someone like David Fincher could have easily elevated this film, its tension and characters considering his impressive work on Gone Girl.The Girl on the Train was a disappointment. I can see an intense thriller made from this but what we got instead was a dull and flat thriller that's honestly quite forgettable.",The Girl on the Train
123,rubenm,"Enjoyable, but nothing special",6,22 November 2016,"'The Girl on the Train' is a bit like a song by Adele. Nice to hear, pleasant melody, good voice, but no emotional appeal, nothing to get excited about really.The film has a classic whodunit structure: someone is killed, but we don't know who did it. The indications point to one person, so you can be sure someone else did it. The main characters are all in one way or another acquainted with each other, which is also a classic mystery element. And there are some traumas from the past, to add some depth to the characters.So far, so good. To add a little spice, the central character is a bit unorthodox: a frustrated alcoholic unemployed girl, who is obsessed by a woman she watches every day when she passes her house by train. Another interesting element is the feminist undertone of the story: the men are the bad guys, the women are the good girls.What is missing, is something that should make this film stand out a little bit, so that you keep thinking about it afterwards, at least for more than half a minute. Emily Blunt's acting is nice, but not nice enough to compensate for the mediocre performances by the other actors. The setting, in a leafy suburb near New York, is all right, but at the same time a bit boring. The revealing of the killer is a surprise, but also a bit unrealistic and unsatisfactory.If there is nothing else on the radio, I can listen to an Adele song. Maybe even two or three. I might enjoy them. But they won't make a lasting impression. I had the same feeling after seeing this film.",The Girl on the Train
124,saadanathan,Interesting but becomes long and tiring 6/10,6,13 February 2021,"I'm always in favor of mystery films with a crime around them and a compelling twist. unfortunately it doesn't always work with any kind of film from this specific genre. ""The Girl on the Train"" is just one of those movies who try too hard to have a compelling and shocking reveal near the end of the plot. although it starts pretty well, the length of the movie is just too long to bare and at one point I was about to quit watching and crash to bed. the cast was pretty good: Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson are all talented actresses and act pretty well during the interactions between their characters. although acting is never enough if the audience loses their focus. overall it was decent enough.",The Girl on the Train
125,ridi-arahan,Sometimes we define ourselves through the eye of someone near to us,7,3 March 2021,"What worked:
I think the movie is an interesting watch considering the twists and turns that the movie takes throughout its run time. The lead characters are interesting as well and they have some grey areas in their portrayal. Overall, it's an enjoyable watch if you are up for something less stimulating but with a content that burns slow but keeps its moments intactWhat did not work:
I have not read the novel but the way movie worked out, I think the novel should have been a great read. I think the movie is a glorified version of the novel. I think the movie is average in every aspect making it an average movie to watch. I don't want to bring it up but the movie objectifies sexuality literally and I don't know if the novel has the same theme as well.

126,danielmanson,It got better and better as it went on,8,4 April 2021,"Ok, I'll start by saying I have not read the book so this quick review is based on it being a stand alone film and not the fact it's an adaptation.I have to say I really enjoyed this film on the whole. First 30/45 minutes or so, I wasn't so much. There was no real direction to the plot and the editing was extremely jumpy, so I was finding it quite hard to figure out what's going on. But do not be put off by this, because the story becomes so much more and you are hooked on the edge of your seat wanting to know what's going to happen next. The twist I thought was brilliant as well, genuinely had no idea that would happen.Acting as well I thought was outstanding, Emily Blunt was absolutely unreal. Sold her performance so well.Other than the beginning of the film, another negative I'd like to mention was character depth. I feel the director should have done a better job of this. There was a distinct lack of it, especially when it came to the other main characters of the group. When this is the case I find it quite hard to feel emotion to them, since I don't ""know them"" well enough.Overall though it's well worth a watch. It's an interesting plot with a great twist to the story and partnered with fantastic acting. 8/10 from me personally!",The Girl on the Train
127,PyroSikTh,A Puzzle Driven by Imperfect Characters,8,12 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train follows three women with intersecting lives. Rachel is a depressed alcoholic who rides the same train to work every day. As it passes her old neighbourhood, she imagines what people's lives might be like on the other side of the window. Megan is an emotionally lost and hollow woman who lives two doors down from Rachel's old house, and is the focus of many of Rachel's imaginary affections; the life she always wanted, at least from Rachel's perspective. Megan works as a nanny for Anna who lives two doors down, married to Rachel's ex-husband. One night Rachel gets blackout drunk, Megan goes missing, and the cops suspect some form of foul play between the three of them.It's hard to talk about the plot of this movie without delving into spoilers as every little detail is slowly revealed and the mystery unravels one point at a time. Each woman is given an introductory scene, cut up by title cards, and after that the movie flits between perspectives and times (with Megan's scenes mostly as flashbacks). There's revelations and twists at every turn as more is revealed about the three women and their various relationships with men and each other. While the ultimate outcome is a bit lacklustre, the twisting to get there was certainly enthralling, dealing with missing memories and lack of information. This is a movie where you can't trust what you're told or what you're shown as it may or may not be accurate. The method of telling the story from various character perspectives allows the plot to weave in whatever it wants the audience to think, whether it's ultimately true or not.The character work is absolutely fantastic though. Even if the mystery leaves you a bit lost, or maybe even bored, it's the characters that take a hold of your attention and keep your focus. For me, as much as I enjoyed the puzzle, it came second fiddle to understanding the three women and the lives they have lived. That said, the treatment of the male figures becomes a little stereotypical and underdeveloped, but I didn't mind so much as they weren't really the focus of the story.Emily Blunt absolutely steals every scene she's in as Rachel. She's a tortured woman who relies on the bottle to get through the day. She's afraid and confused, but ultimately all she wants to do is help herself and those involved learn the truth of what happened, even if her lies to do so end up distancing her from everyone else. Blunt's various monologues as well are so powerful, offering emotional glimpses into the mind of someone so utterly down the rabbit hole and trying to claw her way out. Haley Bennet is also really great as Megan, an equally as lost woman, but who copes with her problems with sex rather than alcohol. There's one scene in particular when she confesses to her therapist about a certain tragic event when she was seventeen that was truly heartbreaking, and she performed it to her very best. A performance that can make me feel things like that is a performance worthy of praise. Rebecca Ferguson is also really good as Anna, but I feel she didn't get as much of a chance to develop as Rachel and Megan. Nonetheless she plays ""the other woman"" come new wife really well, eternally scared and cautious of Rachel and what she might do next.The male actors are all on top form as well. Justin Theroux plays Rachel's ex Tom with such an unpredictability. His performance is charming and likable one moment and horrific and scary the next. This trait is something Luke Evans shares in his performance as well, as Megan's husband Scott. He loves his wife and yearns for a family, but he's not without his somewhat violent tendencies. Edgar Ramirez is also great as the underutilised therapist. He doesn't get a whole lot to do, but he strikes as one of more likable male characters (alongside ""Man in the Suit"" who like all the male characters, teeters between creepy and charming).The Girl on the Train is a winding puzzle of a movie that requires attention and focus to be able to follow. It's not a linear story, as it jumps between flashbacks and opposing perspectives all the time, and yet this goes a long way to building the suspense and offering pieces only when it's relevant. Various revelations are unlocked as the plot progresses. The real lure for me were the conflicted and imperfect characters who are each as likable as they are unlikeable. This grey treatment of it's characters is the film's strongest suit, but I can completely understand why it might divide audiences. Rachel is undoubtedly the main character, but in her alcoholic state, she's prone to stupid decisions that often don't sit well. I give The Girl on the Train a solid 8/10, and would certainly recommend it, at least once. I think it might be interesting to see it again, but a third viewing might be a little unnecessary.",The Girl on the Train
128,CinematicInceptions,Cheap Thrills,5,7 February 2017,"This was an actor's movie. It was character driven and all of the characters were normal people with complicated lives, which allowed for some good performance moments. But the higher quality acting could not save the horrendous script and directing. Sure, the director did a good job creating suspense and using some inventive shots. There was some good craft that went into that. In terms of being organic, though, there was a lot lacking.I have not read the book, but it sounds like it was quite the page turner and is riding the coat tails of Gone Girl. It has some similar themes to Gone Girl since it's about women getting back at men who mistreat them, but these themes are not included in a way that gives the scenes more substance. From seeing the movie, I could sense that the source material was pretty engaging and interesting, but the movie did not possess the page turning quality of a mystery book. Much of the movie was composed of showing how the connections between Rachel, Meagan, and Anna's lives all fit together. The problem was that most of the revelations weren't that surprising. They all pretty much told us something that had already been revealed and then a little more. It was easy to keep track of the information while I was watching it, but none of it hit me that hard or mad me more interested. Plus, it didn't really lead up to anything. The one reveal that actually worked for me was when Rachel finds out that Tom lied to her about what happened during her blackouts. Then, the movie took about twenty more minutes explaining all the different ways that Tom had been a jerk to these three women, so by the time the movie ended I was just bored.An equally major issue was that the dialogue did not feel realistic. The actors were able to make it a little better, but there's only so much that actors can do with a bad script. Some of the encounters took places in implausible settings, like when Scott is waiting in Rachel's apartment. There were also times when the characters would have big emotion dumps that just didn't feel like something an actual person would say. Worst of all was the climax. When Tom tells Rachel that ""In a way, you really killed her"", he just sounded like a total idiot, which is not good if you are trying to make an audience despise your villain. And most of my theater, myself included, actually laughed at the part when Anna twists the corkscrew deeper into Tom's neck. It may have been a great moment in the book, but it felt just so uncalled for that I couldn't help but laugh at it.I generally do not recommend this. It does not have that great of an element of suspense and is unlikely to hold your attention for long. It does look nice and has some decent editing and cinematography, but the technical skill does not make it a good movie any more than unique colors can make a good painting. Overall Rating: 6.2/10.",The Girl on the Train

130,HEFILM,Lifetime movie only not even a good one,2,30 October 2016,"Both dull and confusing with a video TV look to it, this is a waste of time in theaters and almost as much of one elsewhere. The opening set up is interesting and the drunken waste of a former life lead character starts out being sympathetic, then it just gets pathetic and helpless.Not much happens and the opening flashback structure makes it all seem like we missed it happening in the first place. The supposedly erotic elements are brief soft focus non-events. And the lead male character is a whore mongering bastard--that's it no other character details or reasons to him. If this were a movie with the genders reversed women would be protesting the movie and rightly so. But the big sin here is it's all so boring.All the actors, aside from the lead, give bland performances shot in a bland TV movie fashion and with some very video looking slow motion effects trying to make things seem stylish, but just make you feel like you and the story will never speed up.A thriller without thrills, characters without depth. Danny Elfman writes an appropriately dull score, but then comes up with a rather exciting end credit piece, perhaps he, like the audience realize the most exciting thing this film has to offer is being over.

131,bbewnylorac,"Not bad, but should have been much better",6,30 January 2021,"The Girl on the Train aspires to be a domestic psychological thriller on par with The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. Bit it's not as good as it could have been. It does have a lot going for it - three strong female leads and a cracking plot idea. An alcoholic young woman (Emily Blunt) rides trains and gets vicariously engrossed in the life of a seemingly happy young couple she sees from a train, and she is also still obsessed with her ex husband and his new wife, who live a few doors up from the couple. Just a bit of a coincidence, no? So our heroine gets off the train and tries to find out what happened to the young woman of the first couple, who goes missing. No one believes her when she starts realising who might be behind the disappearance. She is gaslighted by pretty much everyone. And even she doesn't trust herself due to blackouts and all her mental problems. The scenes aren't snappy enough, and the movie swings from one moody, melodramatic scene to another and from the present to flashbacks, with an emphasis on great lighting and camera angles and music better suited to a music video or a TV tabloid true crime series. There are some great small roles including Alison Janney and Lisa Kudrow as a detective and an ex workmate of the drunk girl. Blunt's is an interesting central character. She's at rock bottom in her life. I did watch to the end, but I kind of went, 'meh' because the script could have done with more work. But the finale was definitely less schlocky than in the book. And the last scene is very good.",The Girl on the Train
132,estreet-eva,Read the book,5,5 February 2018,"All of the elements which drove the artistic success of the modern suspenseful noir that was the book work against it as a movie. The book unfolds inextractably but slowly. The narrative perspective changes with different character's stories falling on atop the next. Much of the suspense happens within the cerebral folds of mostly the main character but often within the thoughts of other characters. The actual physical action occurs ends quickly and much happens offscreen. All of these elements make this story of a wildly unreliable narrator embroiled in a murder easy to translate into a movie. While noble, staying true to the book probably worked against the story in this case. Emily Blunt as the titular, divorced, barren alcoholic doesn't commit to a physical transformation suggested by the character in the book who slides from withsome young wife to bloated drunk between present day and flashback. Blunt needed to blunt her attractiveness more in the way Charlize Theron did in ""Monster."" The film treats the husband as a somewhat minor costar compared to his more central role in the book. The lack of getting to know him in the movie makes the ending less impactful and this is definitely story that lives or dies by the final reveal. In short, read the book, an engaging and well told tale.",The Girl on the Train
133,ethanbresnett,A solid adaptation of a great novel,7,11 October 2020,"I'll caveat this review by saying that I had read the book prior to watching the film which, with films like this is always a bit of a disadvantage. The plot relies on the mystery, the suspense, the shock, the thrill. All of which was taken away from me having read the book. As a result, in all honesty I'd say if you've read the book maybe don't bother with the film. Don't get me wrong the film is solid, and is a faithful and accomplished adaptation of the book, but that's all it is. It doesn't expand on it or change elements very heavily. Often a book being faithfully adapted can be a curse as much as a blessing.The performances were all pretty good, particularly Emily Blunt, who played the part of Rachel very well I thought (despite a sporadic attempt at a US accent in parts). She brought to life the desperation, confusion and guilt of the character very well and was a very strong lead. The support cast were all great too, particularly Rebecca Ferguson who I thought stood out, as well as Justin Theroux. It was a well put together cast who all played their parts well.In terms of the plot, its a great story and very well told. I won't go into any details as plots like this are best approached cold in my opinion so that you can fully enjoy all of the twists and turns, but suffice to say it delivers everything you want from a crime suspense thriller. The story drip feeds you clues and red herrings, to keep you interested and guessing the plot until the final reveal. The characters are intriguing, very flawed and real feeling with good exploration and depth. The book was quite gritty and real in exploring its characters, and the film picks this up well. It's a great plot, so you won't be disappointed there.One of my criticisms was that I thought the film was cut a bit weird in places. There were a few scenes that were far too choppy, so I think the camera work and direction could have been a bit cleaner in parts. I did also think the pacing was a little off, but maybe that's because I knew the ending so the plot wasn't as exciting to me as it could have been.For fans of thrillers and mysteries definitely give The Girl On The Train a go as it has everything you want from this kind of story, and is a perfectly fine film. However if you've read the book I don't think there's too much sense treading over old ground.",The Girl on the Train
134,CineMuseFilms,a female-driven thriller with a spectacular finale of feminine vengeance,7,23 October 2016,"What could you do with the power to create another person's memories? Perhaps make them remember you as always wonderful or themselves as always hopeless. This unusual premise runs through The Girl on the Train (2016), its plausibility resting on the victim being in such an alcoholic haze that their regular blackouts become blank mental spaces to be filled with memories chosen by someone close. This twisted relationship between memory and truth filters the story in ways that produce a novel viewpoint in a traditional thriller.Rachel's alcoholism started when IVF failed and it eventually ended her dream marriage. She lives off her alimony and spends her time as a train passenger voyeur who watches other people in fantasy worlds while she sips vodka out of a sports bottle. Every day she rides past her former neighbourhood just gazing out windows and she becomes fixated on a couple that appear to have everything. When she notices a new man on the scene she is driven compulsively to explore what happened. In the process, we become witness to a triple set of simmering relationships that turn dangerous when a babysitter's body is found gruesomely buried nearby. Rachel is implicated when, unable to account for her whereabouts, she becomes a murder suspect.Constant inebriation makes an unreliable narrator and Rachel's hold on reality regularly dissolves while frequent flashbacks create disorientation amidst the detail of who is being unfaithful or untruthful with whom. The narrative structure is both complex and well-constructed. It is like a jigsaw puzzle being assembled by first laying out the most distant pieces in isolation, then randomly laying out more on the board's periphery. All the time we are uncertain whether Rachel is sane or sozzled as, one by one, clues about what happened on the night of the murder are laid out with surgical precision in the finest tradition of a Hitchcock thriller.Emily Blunt's performance drives this film despite the incongruity of her unexplained Britishness in America. A drunk narrator does not readily earn audience sympathy, but Rachel's pained eyes and mournfulness are engaging. The soundtrack adds a psychological thriller edge to a well-paced tale despite Rachel's permanent introspection. While the film has a strong support cast, no other character is developed beyond a two-dimensional persona in what is a female-driven story with a spectacular finale of feminine vengeance. The last piece of the jigsaw drops in with a satisfying thud.",The Girl on the Train

138,James_De_Bello,8/10,8,5 November 2016,"Rachel (Emily Blunt) is a divorcée, an alcoholic and a depressed woman who is struggling to keep in touch with life. She takes the train for the city every day and comes back in the evenings with the same train. she always sits in the same place and that is in order to have the best view on Megan (Haley Bennett) a girl who lives in a house Rachel passes by every day and over whom she is unhealthily obsessed.I will stop there because I would consider anything more than that a spoiler to the film and if you have yet to read or watch anything about this film I would recommend to anyone to do as I did and go in completely blind because I had a blast with this mystery film.""The Girl on the Train"" graces us with yet another killer performance by Blunt and with a relentlessly riveting experience that is more than just about guessing 'who did it?' and, contrary to what many have said, has nothing to do with ""Gone Girl"" neither on a cinematic level, nor thematically.After seeing this film there is one thing that just was stuck in my head: Emily Blunt's performance. I have been a supporter of her since the first time I saw a movie of her's and she has just kept building upon that and has now reached the level of what is possibly the best actress of our times. She nails this role. She doesn't overplay it, her persona does not transpire on screen, both the actress and the acting disappear and leave place for a fully realized character.Many could have overplayed the drunk element, many would have overplayed the depressive one and many more would have lost themselves in melodramatic territory. Not Blunt, she keeps this thing together at every single emotional beat and every plot twist, this performance feels so alive and so real, the empathy you manage to reach with this unstable character is incredible and even in her most mad moments where it would seem like it's going to far, Blunt comes in and grounds this person in reality. I have hardly ever seen drunkenness being portrayed so tactfully and so touchingly on the big screen. We manage to understand Rachel's every move, the way she thinks and really get an insight into her tragic paranoia and her incredibly sad life.The rest of the all star cast is very good too and Rebecca Ferguson demonstrates she is here to stay after MI5. Taylor takes an interesting choice with the photography of the film and shoots almost everything on a tight lens in close up. I have to say that it took some time to get used to, but the choice was actually very smart and it gives the film a unique feel and juxtaposes this style to the paranoia of these characters. Every one of them is shot in their own particular way reflecting their journey and whilst I think there is a useless effort from the film to differentiate these characters clearly for the audience at the start, the cinematography worked beautifully and enhanced every story turn and plot twist with truly inventive visuals. This film for example gets the characters remembering flashy memories right, something that is really hard to do.Thinking about the feature a little more I realized how much I like the intrigue, how smartly it was built up and more than that how Rachel fits into every one of these story threads seamlessly and brings them together at the end with this great performance by Blunt. Yet, what I also realized was how Megan, Haley Bennet's character, ends up having very little to do. The film digs in her backstory a lot and I felt like she should have been a bigger component of this, her effect on the story is less than what the premise makes the audience wish for and even Bennet herself, though great actress she is, ends up playing the role a little too sexually-one-note.I am proud to say that I had loads of excitement with this film and considered myself blessed to see such a performance unfold on screen, there are little moments of acting by Blunt that really open up a world and that is really when acting comes alive the most for me: in the small moments of empathy that you do not expect and that hit you right in the gut. Add to that a fantastic mystery with great performances and direction across the board and the result is a distinctly crafted thriller.",The Girl on the Train
139,xhidden99,My God what a dreary dull movie,4,31 March 2017,This was heralded as the greatest thing since Hitchcock. Wow is that off the mark. A dull ponderous do nothing monotonous train wreck of a movie filled with characters who are either cardboard or loathsome. A tale of rich sad spoiled white girls obsessed with babies like all women of course are. Drunks and sluts and their idiot suburban husbands and the world's most unethical psychiatrist. There is no big reveal no cliché I have a split personality and didn't know I was a psycho murderer. Nothing. Just rich spoiled drunk women either getting pregnant or trying to get pregnant or stalking women who are pregnant. But pretty much it's long boring monologues about babies and pregnancy. Occasionally Emily Blunt stares off into space remembering a time she was on a bender and trying steal babies. I guess if there's any Lifetime Movie Takeaway it's that men are abusive monsters who treat women only as brims mares to pump out babies.,The Girl on the Train
140,fluffchop,Terrific if slightly sad movie,8,9 February 2021,"This to me was a very good film. Well written with great acting performances. You can tell good acting because it never looks like someone is acting, you just see a character carrying out their behavior. It is well paced, intriguing and an excellent film to watch. This is all based on something well written to begin with. There are no special effects and other such cheap trickery. We are however lead to believe circumstances were one way, when it is later revealed they were another. So that's a little bit tricky in a nice satisfying way towards the end of the film. It gives us a payoff and we feel glad to have sat through it all till the end. Good film. I hope this review or opinion helps someone and that they also enjoy the film, or give it a miss accordingly. Thanks for reading.",The Girl on the Train
141,coreyjdenford,Unstable train,6,5 October 2016,"This is my review of The Girl on the Train (spoiler free)*** (3/5)THROUGHOUT THE SECOND act of The Girl on the Train Rachel (Emily Blunt) is the key suspect in a missing person's case and she asked a load of questions by Detective Riley (Allison Janney) the leader of the case, however Rachel doesn't quite know how to answer the questions she is given so the Detective just leaves without saying another word. It's a scene that is drowned out by dry melodrama and a lot of anguish as Rachel is entangled in the case and is trying to figure out how that girl went missing. Booze, sex, lies, violence, and murder are a very prominent theme throughout Paula Hawkins' 2015 best-selling murder/mystery/thriller page turner, and naturally when a novel like that is being made on for the big screen there are many attributes to consider. Where is it set? How many thrills are there? In the novel there are many unencumbered and unexpected thrills that are dark and tend to lead to a lot of violence. However the adaptation into the big screen written by Erin Cressida Wilson with the help of the novel, the trills are limited and are expected, with little violence, mainly focusing on the booze and the sex. The novel is set in a fictional town in Buckinghamshire surrounded by beautiful English houses and countryside, whereas the movie is set in New York State and Rachel takes the train every day from upstate New York to Downtown Manhattan it's a mistake that cannot be forgiven.The film mostly focuses on the main character Rachel a divorcée with a severe drinking problem Emily Blunt's performance as Rachel is almost convincing but with a huge amount of star power blocking her from pulling off a fully convincing alcoholic, throughout the film she also serves as an almost reliable narrator for nearly all of her screen-time and while Blunt is a fine actress her performance is decent and only just manages to stop the train from derailing off the tracks. It's a rather starry cast mostly focusing on Blunt the other women Hayley Bennett, who plays Megan Hepwell is a young woman who has many secrets at hand, she is mainly used as the Nanny of Anna's (Rebecca Ferguson) daughter, but she has a dark secret, it turns out that she is a user trying to get other men's pants. The characters have human flaws which are good for the human touch so they are relate-able; dealing with real life situations about, what happens when someone you love cheats on you? The answer you'll be pleased to find out unfolds throughout the film. However these other two characters maybe the focus but they are just used as an accessory and feel a little limited in their development. The story is very unbalanced, with the location being wrong and the poorly written dialogue, the film relies on its decent performances to keep it going but even then doesn't fully succeed, and it's filled with giant gaping holes that can't be fixed.Every scene that comes through the film until the strong foreseeable thrill towards the end almost out stay their welcome and nearly all of them promise a thrill with a lot violence do not succumb, so as you're shuffling in your seat through the dry melodrama wondering where the story is going. Director Tate Taylor may not be name that is on everyone's lips but his previous venture involved Chadwick Boseman as international soul superstar James Brown, it almost seems as if this was bearing down on and hoping to be perfect however it's a challenge that he couldn't quite complete. Throughout it feels like a rather rough pitch between Strangers on a Train and Rear Window and almost feels very familiar as the story goes on, thankfully as it gets the third it manages to steer away from that feeling of familiarity. Thankfully, the start of The Girl on the Train it starts off slow and carries on that way for about forty to forty five minutes and it seems as if the film is going to carry on this way filled with a lot of drama and almost upsetting moments as the film steers on, but the immense escapade of foreseeable thrills takes away the chance to settle with the movie, that now relies on it's cast and performances to keep it going. It almost doesn't need saying but this an awful adaptation that may not see Oscar glory.Does the film pick itself up towards the third act? Yes; and just in the nick of time in a montage scene that shows what really happened to Megan and how she became front page news of the city, in a scene that unfolds with plenty of violence and drama but unfortunately has yet another poorly executed thrill that shamefully sticks out like a sore thumb, it's a rather expected turn of events as Rachel and Anna are figuring out who kidnapped and murdered Megan turns out that the suspect was right in front of their eyes. Aside from all of the shameful poorly written dialogue and poorly executed final thrill, it's a very ambitious adaptation that relies on its decent performances with a small sense of familiarity.VERDICT: While it's an ambitious big-screen adaptation of a best-selling page turner, that's filled with decent performances that manage to keep the train from derailing. But overall there is no escaping that this is an unfathomably poorly executed thriller with a poor script.6/10 decent but unnecessary",The Girl on the Train
142,jtncsmistad,"Trans-Atlantic Shift in Locale doesn't Save ""The Girl on the Train""",6,17 March 2017,"I read the best-selling book ""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins. It's pretty good. Now I've seen the movie based on the book. And it is pretty good, as well. Not bowl you completely ass over elbows good, either one. Nonetheless, entertainment that passably suffices.Emily Blunt (""Sicario"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"") is one the finest actress's of an era. Her poignant lead performance as the deeply troubled alcoholic Rachel is as genuinely affecting as it is wholly off-putting. Which, in essence, is a description that encapsulates this entire production. These are outright unlikable and alarmingly damaged characters, each of whom is either pitiable and sad or loathsome and sociopathic. Director Tate Taylor (""The Help"") has fashioned a world in which it is damn near impossible to connect with or root for anyone. Perhaps this is intentional, but it certainly doesn't serve to create an overly meaningful relationship with an audience.And I for one am sorely disappointed that the film is set in the New York City vicinity and not amongst the environs of London as in Hawkins's story. It would have been so much more resonate and interesting to have seen these scenes play out where they did on the page as opposed to where they do here in a shameless effort to pump up the commercial appeal to the American market.After all, it's not exactly as if us Yanks flocked to the theatre to catch ""The Girl on the Train"" as it was, mate.",The Girl on the Train
143,trpdean,"Wonderful possibilities - but alas poor execution by screenplay, director",6,29 December 2018,"As others wrote in their reviews, my interest in the film was also sparked by seeing Gone Girl. The fact that the movie was set in a town near where I grew up (and my family still lives) - the nearby town of my high school sports rival Ardsley (though apparently shot in two adjoining towns, Irvington (where Washington Irving lived , his house is preserved as a museum - and near where he set such stories as Rip Van Winkle and The Headless Horseman) and Hastings on Hudson - increased my natural curiosity.Girls see things on trains - I recently saw again on television, ""Lady on a Train"" with Deanna Durbin. As this site states: ""While in a train halted at a station, Nikki Collins witnesses a murder committed in a nearby building. When she brings the police to the scene of the crime, they think she's crazy ..."" I own and saw several weeks ago, the movie of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mystery,""4:50 from Paddington"". As this site says: ""A friend of Miss Marple's sees a woman being strangled in a passing train. When police cannot find a body and doubt the story, Miss Marple enlists professional housekeeper, Lucy Eyelesbarrow, to go undercover"".Well, Emily Blunt's character rides a train each morning and looks forward to peering out the window at a couple at the same house in Ardsley. (the train stops at Ardsley station near the house, so she has time to peer). We learn later that the couple consists of her former (unfaithful) husband and the mistress during that marriage,whom he's since married and with whom he continues to live in the same house in which he had lived with Blunt while they were married.The film revolves around Blunt's character and her friend (with whom she lives), and two married couples - her former husband and mistress now wife, and their governess and her husband. One of them goes missing- suspicion falls on more than one of the others - and the difficulties of an alcoholic's memory which would at least shed light on who done it.The movie has much in common with the wonderful domestic suspense thrillers of a few decades ago - particularly with Richard Gere and Michael Douglas: A Perfect Murder, Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, Final Analysis, Primal Fear, Unfaithful. Unfortunately each of those was superior to thisOne of my chief criticisms is that we are shown flashback after flashback after flashback throughout the film (perhaps 75?) only to be told later that they were false - and merely the mistaken understanding of the person apparently remembering. This causes us to mistrust EVERYTHING WE'RE NOW SEEING.
Perhaps all will be revealed as false. Thus, suspense cannot be developed - maybe it's not happening.Another criticism arises from the deliberate and repeated changes of time. Again and again we are told on the screen ""Last Friday"" or ""Two Months Ago"" or ""Four Months Ago"" or ""Six Months Ago"" or ""One Month Ago"" involving different characters - and we just never know when that earlier time period is no longer what is being shown. Nothing says ""Now ladies and gentlemen, back to the Present"" And there's no reaasn whatever for any of those flashbacks - why not show us chronologically?Another criticism is that two of the characters are simply made flat - the charming and beautiful Rebecca Ferguson (who was astonishingly good in The White Queen series) and the husband of the governess. Perhaps there was far more in the book - but in this film, they are simply not made interesting. They react as anyone would to anything happening around themAnother criticism is that the movie fails to acknowledge or even attempt to explain why - one character has an appeal to women that rivals Errol Flynn - every woman adores him (at first) and wants nothing more than to have him impregnate her. The movie doesn't seem to understand that this is what it is telling us.I join others in praising Emily Blunt's performance - deliberately made quite ugly looking, a sodden drunken mess in every way, coarse, gross, profane, and we believe this is who this character is - completely. It's quite a performance!",The Girl on the Train

It kept getting more and more mysterious but also there were a ton of flaws. Its one of those crime movies where the police is a joke and dont do anything while regular people are playing detective. Also the timeline is incredibly confusing. Even though i like confusing timeline movies, this one wasnt done well.

The slow pace (sometimes, and not that originally interrupted by sudden flashbacks), the inconsistent performances (moreover made more annoying by the use of a trashy language), the boring scenes (among which the explicit sex scenes stand out as really disturbing), do not help the picture arise above the level of a man-hating TV drama, without any consistency and on the whole disappointing.",The Girl on the Train

This girl has a problem - she's an alcoholic. She also has an obsession with her past life, her ex, who went on to re-build his life after his relationship with Blount failed.The movies focuses on 4 people: ex-husband, his new wife Amy, his ex wife Rachel (blount), and neighbor Megan. Various other characters work their way into key parts of the story too. Rachel is never sure of what is real vs what is not because her drinking led her to various blackouts. Flashbacks give you glimpses, but again, what's real vs not?The Director did a masterful job of building as much intrigue and second guessing as possible. But if you are paying attention, you start having a pretty good idea of what is going on after a certain point. Then it's just a race to the inevitable conclusion.The movie is not confusing as I've read in some comments. You are being given different theories about what is going on, and it's up to you to dig thru it all, which makes this a decent psycho thriller. Throw in a psychologist to mix things up and you start wondering even more. The movie succeeds because Blount is absolutely outstanding as Rachel. What a terrific acting performance by her - You feel all her emotions and wonder throughout what really happened, till things clear up a bit.There is some nice cinematography of the Hudson river. I loved the way the Director used the train to create snapshots of lives. It really mimics our own lives as we see bits and pieces of others, and wonder what they are doing. Very satisfying movie.

150,eshwarmail,"Manipulative, contrived and illogical elements fizzles out the mystery and suspense. Some good performances couldn't save it either",5,28 January 2017,"Extremely popular thrillers are generally dumber than the actual good ones. Going by the popularity of its source material, I did have my inhibitions on how this might be. There is a minor but there is a chance of having the material improvised when transforming it on to the big screen, I had counted on it - How wrong was I? Apart from a predictably superlative performance by Emily Blunt, everything else just falls apart. Rachel (Emily Blunt) is a drunk divorced woman living in a friend's apartment and takes a train for work every day. Her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) who cheated on her, currently lives with his present wife and a newly born in the same house which Rachel and Tom bought together. As the house is by the rail tracks which she passes by on her train commute every day, she gets obsessed by a couple who stays a couple of houses further from her house - names them Jess (Haley Bennett) and Jason (Luke Evans) in her head and wonder about their lives. One day she finds Jess intimate with someone who is not Jason, being in a heavily inebriated condition she impulsively wants to confront Jess and gets off the train. She wakes up the next morning bruised and blacked out of previous night's memory. Megan (Jess in her head) is missing and it is all over the news...When the book took the world by storm, it was admired for its breezy read full of twists and turns. There wasn't many who were fond of its too many gray characters or the quality of its story. Not having read the book, I will leave that observation from news articles as is. It definitely got its teaser trailer right, infusing that intrigue in you with all the mystery, suspense and modern story- telling. The movie hardly had anything more to offer from its teaser as it looked like it was just stretched out from it. Not every single person you meet in life could be as twisted as in Paula Hawkins world which makes it unrelatable. The plot twists are sometimes ridiculous and the important sequences that drive the story ends up being illogical. You will know the major climax revelation from a mile away and how it eventually pans out is quite a dampener. Something from a viewer's perspective is that you don't get a character to root for. With each character having their own misgivings, you'd rather think they are better off at where they are. Most of the actions look illogical and unbecoming of their characters especially the eventual victim and murderer. Emily Blunt has had an interesting filmography but I don't think her potential has been fully realized yet even though she got a chance to showcase her brilliance in bits, same goes in this movie too. Once you figured out the gist of the story and know where it is going, it becomes a plodding bore and a lot of time to get there. The background score didn't standout and the cinematography is just apt. When adapting from a book, the most important consideration would be to identify which section to highlight, which section to omit - as it isn't possible to carry forward in its entirety. Not having read the book, I can't comment about these choices but knowing how popular the book became - there is a chance that something went wrong in this process. Manipulative, contrived and illogical elements fizzles out the mystery and suspense. Some good performances couldn't save it either.",The Girl on the Train
151,ritera1,Surprisingly well done,8,21 October 2017,"Some very good work all around, by and large. I have some reservations about the final 30 minutes in the direction, though, but not the writing. Very surprised at Emily Blunt's Rachel. Although there was the benefit of some very good material, she captured nicely the insanity of alcoholism and the anger and thinking it brings. Read some critiques that she was too pretty for the role of a drunk, which was likely true. But it's a movie and real drunks are not easy to look at. And she was not that pretty in this.The direction and presentation did not adequately clarify her lapsing in her sobriety, though.It did smack of a very well done Lifetime movie in the melodrama. Ideal pretty couple. Convenient settings and backstory with her ex-husband being on the same street. Handsome young therapist. Very much ""perfect storm"". But, in the end, I bought it. A few gender biases were displayed. The two men were very cliché, but it worked. The husband of the murdered girl was a bit unbelievable vs. his good looks. I just kept thinking that guy has other choices. The femme fatale was well drawn but still cliché in her seductiveness. But the drowned baby backstory was a valid and compassionate device. In both her and the 2nd wife, it was a good movie for men with low self- esteem to watch when they are rejected by good-looking women. Consider the source.I did guess it was the husband that was the killer. It's always the last guy you suspect throughout. But the material seemed to be a bit too permissive of Rachel and the 2nd wife's actions. No drunken man entering a house and holding a baby would be forgiven, but we were asked to be forgiving of drunk Rachel.And the 2nd wife waited not to be a compliant robot of her murderer husband when he is killed by the lead. Then we are somehow suppose to cheer that she, technically, likely finished off her husband. It was an interesting moment, but I did not stand behind her choice.And the direction of the last 30 minutes. Although the first 2/3 was adequate vs. the material, the ending needed more coverage and nuance that would have broken from the pace and look of the first 2/3. The last 30 minutes was too matter-of-fact, like it would happen in real life. There was much more there from the husband holding the baby to knocking out his first wife. Thus, I think I would have preferred it all to be in line with what the last 30 minutes needed. (And as a side note, Rachel's drunken recollection suggested to me that the 2nd wife was in the tunnel and not the femme fatale. Thus, when the sober version of such was shown to the killing, I was surprised that it was the femme fatale.)",The Girl on the Train

153,nicolechan916,Intensely Perplexing,6,26 March 2017,"A very intriguing premise for a story. I'd admit that the suspense is well done, and the story well planned out. However, I think the marketing buildup brought my expectations up higher than it should have been. The trailer gives nothing away, and you expect something amazing, and to me, it fell a little short of that. Don't get me wrong, I still think it was a good movie, just not great. I could not relate to Blunt's character, and felt disconnected from her. Her acting was well done, but having a protagonist like that makes for a very confusing watch for readers. Basically, throughout the whole film, the audience follows along with Rachel as she tries to piece together what happened. Really quite perplexing. I did feel frustrated at some points, because it is slow to give information. The rest of the cast did their parts well too. However, because there are so many characters, it doesn't feel like the connection is there. It might be because of the heavy mood of the film that suppresses the connection, or it may be Rachel's cloudy perception. Whatever the case, a few characters seemed to be brooding with some darkness in them, which was very unsettling to watch. As well, there isn't enough depth given to the supporting characters. It seems like all the attention was given to Rachel. The overall tone of the film, is what I would describe as intense. A lot of intense emotion hidden in the shadows that reveals itself bit by bit, and then exposes itself completely at the end. The dark colors and sometimes first person shooting, helps with creating the atmosphere, and there are also a lot of close ups for Rachel, which helps us to grasp her state of mind. Overall, the premise of the story has a lot of potential, but fell short. If they had picked up the pace a little, and given the characters more depth, it would have been better.",The Girl on the Train

Perhaps like the very train Rachel was digesting in. From good, to bad, to better than before.I believe Tate Taylor did an excellent job at disguising Tom's involvements, especially given that, once one sees Tom with Anna, you could pretty much connect the dots, but Tate made Rachel's blurs, our own, and threw in a spanner by introducing the Psychiatrist.I love the way the story was told. It was a constant resuscitation, that also kept the mystery alive. Megan's tragedy was, so incredibly ghastly that, it gave the whole story and plot, an extra pair of lungs. Anna too, for a moment evokes such frustration in me, that contributes to the film.Rebecca and Haley were also so very stunning, but Emily, so effortlessly, stole the show, like she was supposed to.The Girl on the Train was constantly on track.

In most cases, Yes, it does. Take, for instance, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", ""Me Before You"", ""The Light Between Oceans"", ""Miss Peregrine's Home Peculiar for Children"", and even ""Nerve"" (and of course, from best-seller to blockbuster: ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them""), which, despite do not be masterpieces of modern filmography, have remained strongly for an enviable period of time at the worldwide box office. Now, it is turn of Paula Hawkins and her ""Girl on the Train"", which reigned in 2015 with an exorbitant 11 million copies and months atop international best-seller lists, therefore, it is not a confidence that long before its official publication, its film rights had already been acquired.Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) is a divorced, unstable and dipsomaniac woman (not girl) that takes the same LIRR train every morning, every night, and sits on the same seat, same window, fantasizing to get back into the life she once had.

In her routine trip, she observes in detail from the window of the carriage to a ""perfect"" couple - from the train - a blonde girl named Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) and her jealous husband Scott (Luke Evans), who lead a relationship of pure sex, falsehoods and unhappiness. Beside, everything continues as usual, her previous house, with her ex- husband, the big difference is that she is no longer there; Tom (Justin Theroux), the mendacious Tom, lives with a younger girl, taller, sexier, with bigger breasts, Ana (Rebecca Ferguson), the woman who ruined the matrimony of Rachel, disturbed, she idealizes her fantasy like a voyeuristic owl during the ten seconds that the train passes through there. However, the obsessions of Rachel with the idealized couple and her previous marriage bring her - alcoholic - has got off the train and try to confront with the ideal girl, although, disoriented, she falls into a vague and diffuse spiral, of which short glimpses and too many blackouts accompany her the following day in her bedroom, bruised, bloodstained and disoriented again. What happened that Friday? Why was she so beaten? and ... Megan H., her role model, with who supposedly had faced , Is she missing?Blunt is merely a piece on the perturbing trip, a crucial piece. Emily never will be a disaster, she is professional, profound and tenaciously eloquent as the unhinged Rachel. Her British accent corresponds with context of the story, despite the film has replaced the environment of United Kingdom by the atmosphere of the United States, however, still working. The way in which she is capable of transmitting distress and sorrow, while also strength and tenacity is unusual, her performance together with the other women's main role is a huge step towards equality in Hollywood, unusually, they are not the two-dimensional characters. The fast-paced trip begins and ends with Ms. Blunt, nevertheless, other people deserve a round of applause too. No one like Rachel, no one like Blunt.Inherent loyalty of movie with the book will keep critical readers with eyes glued to the screen, excited with the course of story even knowing the powerful end. Both in the novel and the film, ""The Girl on the Train"" addresses topics linked to the life of a normal human as infidelity, divorce, alcoholism, male chauvinist, maltreatment, lust and serious dangers of lies that holds each person, then speeds up and hits its true stride, clarifying what happened that afternoon of Friday with Megan , the muddled life of Rachel and the issues of others characters causing a revolution of disproportionate twists and emotions, who said that the excesses are detrimental? Here, they are not.It is ineluctable, and not exactly is a defect, moreover, it is a colossal compliment. The writing of Hawkins has a connotation with the novel by Gillian Flynn, ""Gone Girl"" from 2012, therefore, the film also. As well and all, ""The Girl on the Train"" moves through the same track, but, by distant rails. Fincher unleashed a media boom with ""Gone Girl"" in 2014 - curiously, in October,- now, Tate Taylor will be who relieves him. The cards of title, its anachronistic structure, its beautiful photography and even its plausible dialogs and instrumental soundtracks has concordances and differences that make it unique.""The Girl on the Train"" is a Hitchcockian ride with a powerful story and an irrefutable potential. Voyeurism, abuses, self-esteem and deadly appearances are combined in Taylor's thriller with such magnetism that once you are on the same train with Rachel, you cannot get off until finished closing credits. One of the most anticipated films of the year is the best thriller since ""Gone Girl"" in 2014. ""The Girl on the Train"" is like riding by train for the first time, simply amazing, swift and paralyzing.",The Girl on the Train
160,quaseprovisorio,awful editing and bad directing ruin the whole plot. it could be way better,3,25 March 2020,"I don't know the book that based this film. But the movie has an interesting plot that is ruined completely with the editing. This could be a great mistery movie about a loner drunken woman that investigates a disappearance of someone she's been checking in the train windows. It's not, because they weren't able to edit it properly and also the director didn't have hands for the pace of this. First, i think the monologue option is not good. It's boring and preditable. in a book it might work, but in a movie is very rare that to happen. Second,how the camera moves. Sometimes it causes dizziness, it's hard for the director to keep the camera still, to have longer scenes with tension, he was not able to build a proper atmosphere. And also the music is a lot of times annoying and repetitive.it's a bit frustrating because this is the type of movies that could have worked very well it if had engaged in the thriller vibe - it tried to be a drama with the intersection of the lives of three women and their own personal traumas and problems. It failed completely in that. the score i'm giving s a bit low, but it's because it was easy to do better with this. Unforunately it was ruined by the editing and the director didn't have enough hands to handle this project.",The Girl on the Train
161,PetarNeo,Blunt? Yes! Movie? No!,5,2 November 2016,"Movie focuses on wife that has an alcohol addiction and has lost everything because of it. It was common for her to lost track of things that she is doing while being drunk but this one will change her and many other lives from the roots. The girl goes missing and everything falls on her. Emily Blunt did a tremendous job portraying our leading character and you can sense all pain, grieve, lost and misery that she is going through, but there is also side filled with delusions, disapproval and disbelieve. As her character maintains to stay herself everybody else just pours everything onto her and the way she is dealing with it all and power that is put into character is astounding and just magnificent. Then movie just couldn't keep her pace and fell apart after first 30 minutes. It became hard to follow from constant jumps from present to past and then going back and just simple shifting without any time for you to adapt. Finally movie just kept being predictable in almost every scene even minor the sense of mystery just disappeared and at half movie it was obvious what happened and who did it and from that point it was even more boring. 2/4",The Girl on the Train

Emily Blunt's accent bounced all over the place. NOT an enjoyable movie to watch; I was glad when it ended. Sorry, cannot recommend, and I wanted to like this so much.

163,Lewis_Heather787,Wow this film drags.....................but does have good performances and moments,6,9 October 2016,"As title of this review states this film is a drag for about three quarters of the run time, which isn't good. The reason for this film dragging is because the story is being built to a massive finale/reveal of who the killer is, which can been seen coming a mile away. Actually when it comes to it the ""reveal"" is a massive let down and missed opportunity for the film to make a statement and blow the audience away. Another negative as sort of mentioned is the pacing of the film, which is all of the place. This film is sort of like squeezing a bottle of ketchup when there is only little bit left inside. It takes you ages to squeeze out a small amount and then all of a sudden the whole bottle comes out. This film is all build up and then a sudden rush of reveals, twists and closing story lines, all of which was rushed. Now onto the positives, yes there actually are some. Firstly the cast, absolutely fantastic performances across the board. They are the saving grace of this film from becoming bad at times, whether it be from the bad screenplay or just overall boring scenes/dialogue. Emily Blunt, Rebecca Ferguson , Haley Bennett, Justin Theroux and Luke Evans all gave really compelling performances, obviously Blunt a little above the rest. Another positive is the switches in time throughout the film which really work. It helps to move the story, although very slowly, on through the film and helps the audience and Emily Blunt's character see situations from various angles. Finally this film is extremely slow for the majority which can make it boring, the re-watchability of this film could almost be impossible just skipped to the end. However the cast and some of the directing in this film saves the film from being bad, and actually makes it good in some parts. 6/10 Average and good in moments.",The Girl on the Train

165,Avwillfan89,"Americanised version of a chilling, suspenseful tale",7,2 January 2017,"Taking a thoroughly English story and turning it into an American one always hurts the original tone. But the story is so rich and powerful that you can't really do too much damage.I'd say the best part about the film is Emily Blunt. Even though she uses her own English accent in the movie, she sounds like someone who has lived in the US for quite some time, and it probably would have made more sense for her to have an American accent. If they changed the setting and all the other characters to American, why not do the same with the protagonist? That being said, she was absolutely perfect for the role. She was consistently sad and droopy and was perfectly convincing as the alcoholic, depressed Rachel. The rest of the story played out as it did in the book. But the truth is, I couldn't put the book down, which doesn't happen very often. So apart from Blunt's acting, and the mysteries surrounding her character's blackout drinking during the night of a girl's murder, the film doesn't do too much for me.",The Girl on the Train
166,perkypops,Poor adaption of Paula Hawkins's excellent book,5,13 February 2017,"The relocation to New York was a huge mistake suggesting the screenplay failed to realise the importance of the railway to the character in Paula Hawkins's book, a quintessentially British railway winding through residential areas on raised embankments and overlooking houses, and stopping a red signals, habitually. The film also failed to reduce Rachel to the real levels of the dangerously flawed alcoholic seemingly unwilling to demonstrate the real hazards those levels present. Overall, if you have not read the book, I would guess the film picks up, well after half way, for a reasonable finale given all other circumstances but it simply doesn't do the book any justice at any level. The acting was pretty good from the main female cast but I felt the male participants didn't resemble the characters in the book at all.A very lightweight film in so many ways which is a great shame because the book is a wonderful read. I did like the music, however.Five out of ten because the film deserves to be on mainstream mediocre circuits right now.",The Girl on the Train

168,Padreviews,8/10 Clever thriller that keeps you guessing,8,2 February 2017,"Superb thriller that keeps you guessing . Let's start with the title "" The girl on the train "" from the best selling book by Paula Hawkins . The title is brilliant and straight away intrigues you . As usual no spoilers in my reviews so I'll take you on part of the journey but we're not going all the way to the destination !The film opens exactly as you would expect with literally A girl on a train narrating her observations and feelings . Those who've read the book will note the change of location from the UK to the US but that was handled far better than I expected and it didn't lose anything from the story .You know something bad is going to happen but your not sure what , she invents her own little world but as you learn more you realise not is all as it seems . Many people have mentioned similarities to Gone Girl , I can't comment on that having not seen it yet but it did remind me of Rebecca and another film I won't mention as it will spoil the film . I managed to see this on a midweek silver screen showing for only £3 a long time after its release in a packed cinema . Not a spare seat in the house , I haven't seen that for a new film , though I do avoid cinemas on Friday & Saturday nights ! I think some of the sex scenes were a little too graphic for the audience as two people walked out !The story is brilliant , it does make you wonder if anyone is faithful in this world . It's definitely a film from a woman's perspective with back stories that help explain people's present day actions . It's adaption to film was always going to be tricky but it manages it admirably . If you like thrillers that keep you guessing to the end and you like to lead up garden paths and dead ends then this is a film for you . I enjoyed it.",The Girl on the Train
169,MickeyTheConstant,A Solid Thriller,7,24 February 2019,This was a really decent thriller. It had loads of twists and turns and had a really strong cast who all gave excellent performances.

170,happy_hangman,Good cast clever plot,8,17 October 2016,"Tate Taylor's 'The Girl On The Train' is a very nice piece of work. A few of the emotional nuances of Paula Hawkins' book are lost (difficult to translate visually), but the intricate weaving of alternate perspectives and no-linear narrative is retained. A tight script, a great ensemble cast - Emily Blunt, Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Bennett are uniformly excellent as the three principals, and the mighty Allison Janney gives fine support. The unreliability of perception and memory with regard to self is used to good effect in Blunt's twitchy turn as our titular heroine, though it's Bennett, I think, who really captures the emotional disconnectedness both characters manifest. A clever, adult, character-driven piece which deserves re-watching.",The Girl on the Train

Meaning they characters responses to situations was more or less what I would expect, as opposed to something stupid happening. The closest thing to being questionable would be is Emily Blunts eyesight THAT good? The acting was very good by the whole cast, plus I was impressed with the very visual cinematography. The first hour was very intriguing but I was a little confused by the various time period changes. Just a little, although it really didn't matter in the end.

172,manuelasaez,"Misandrist movie #64, now with more absurdity!",2,7 October 2016,"After seeing Gone Girl, I left the theater angry and a bit shaken. The movie reminded me how unfair our society is, where people can get away with accusing others of wrong doing, and ruin the lives of said people by just stating, ""He did that to me!"". It was a well made film that evokes the feelings of the times we are living in, where a persons belief and emotion is more important than facts and data. This film, The Girl on the Train, made me angry as well, but for all of the opposite reasons. Again, we have a film where the man is automatically the villain, and all of the women victims. This man-hating spectacle is intensified by having one man ultimately responsible for ruining the lives of not just one person, but 5! The women had nothing to do with it, they were all innocent, and none of them did absolutely nothing to deserve their fates.I am sick and tired of these types of movies with an obvious feminist agenda, where men are always the bad guys and women the helpless victims. It only tells one side of the story, where one gender is exalted above the other, and it is not only dishonest, but insulting to its audience. No one was innocent in this tale, and unlike Gone Girl (where everyone admitted their wrong doings), the women of this film not only relished in their faults, but continued to exacerbate them by their repeated actions. It's a slap in the face to those of us out there that are good men, and would do anything for the person's we love. Emily Blunt is one of the finest actors of our time, and this movie deserves a higher grade simply due to her stunning and jaw-dropping performance. But I cannot, in good conscience, advise anyone to see this obvious misandrist tripe that only serves to further a simplistic and deviant belief that, ""Men are Bad. Men hate women. Women are victims. Women should ruin or kill men who don't do as they say"". If it all sounds neanderthal-like, it's simply because movies like these are made to appease a very specific group of people; people who don't expect to think when asked to, but only react to what they are told to react to. This type of film-making has no place in Hollywood, least of all cinema in 2016.I am not an easily offended person, but after watching this film as a man, I am offended. Hollywood, you are failing men everywhere. You should all feel ashamed and think long and hard as to the messages you are vomiting into the world. Men are not your punching bags that you can repeatedly assault ad naseum to appease your entitled and mentally deranged audience. Not even Blunt could save this travesty of a film for me. I want my time and emotion back. You can keep the ticket price.",The Girl on the Train
173,abouhelier-r,Movie Vs Book: The Girl on the Train,7,22 October 2016,"A divorcée becomes entangled in a missing person investigation that promises to send shock waves throughout her life.The Girl on the Train is an adaptation of Paula Hawkins' prismatic 2015 bestseller and it is at heart a murder mystery, yet in many ways that is the film's most routine aspect. The story is promising and has resemblances to Alfred Hitchcock, Patrick Hamilton or also something of Agatha Christie's detective story 4:50 From Paddington. What makes a good movie adaptation of a book succeed? The quality of the source material matters, of course, but it's hardly a guarantee. A lot of great novels have curled up and died on screen and some forgettable ones have been pulled through. The practise of referring to grown women as girls continue... here is the one on the train, as opposed to the gone one or the one with the dragon tattoo. Readers of the book were treated to amusingly precise descriptions of Rachel's daily, boozy transit. The film not only ditches these good, shabby detail but shifts the whole business to upstate New-York, to give it scenic benefits to and to associate itself with the cool suburban created by David Fincher in Gone Girl. Paula Hawkins' madly popular novel has a terrific main character on the page and the fact that she's still terrific on screen is a reason alone to see it. Rachel, the main narrator, hits a new high in unreliability. For one thing, she's mostly drunk throughout most of the story, so her memories are not to be trusted - not even is she sure if what she remembers really happened; and for another, her whole life has become a lie. Emily Blunt who portrays Rachel brilliantly in the movie plays half her scenes as she's holding back tears (or screams, who knows...). She's a mesmerising actress who's been in need of a role like this one. It should, at last, elevate her star power. She manages to pull off a perilously effective performance and plays Rachel with a cold that makes it look as if her facial features are slowly coming apart. We can't help but root for her, even when she's a drunken destroyer with borderline personality disorder. At one point she stands in a bathroom, smearing the mirror with lipstick, letting out the rage she feels at her ex, and it is a cathartic moment and uncomfortable moment. As a novel, The Girl on the Train is told by a series of unreliable narrators and that's part of its post-Gone Girl feature. In the movie, the unreliability factor plays differently. It comes down to images shown and we, therefore, believe it, but the things we've been shown may not, in fact, have happened. Did I loose you...? Right. Though it is not all that different from what the book did, it can be unsettling at some point. Moreover, the narrative is carefully split between three women whose lives interlink tragically. Indeed, everyone in this film is connected, to the point that the movie has a turbulently incestuous small-town-soap-opera quality. It's a structural movie that carries ideology and a sense of women being forced to live divided lives. Nonetheless, there's a strong feminist-inflected suggestion that Rachel, Megan, and Anna are different sides of a singular shared experience, their dreams memories and voices intermingling in a patchwork of female rage, like a silent scream. Scrambling a story is easy, but it's done here to right perfection, with suspenseful effect. Overall, to the adventurous cinematography, to an expressive score and an oddly sympathetic script, this cinematic train is rolling.",The Girl on the Train
174,daggersineyes,Awful,1,28 September 2017,"I tried to stick with it but it was unrelentingly miserable & excruciatingly boring. If there was a mystery in there somewhere I could not have cared less about solving it. The characters were forgettable & not in the least bit likable or relatable. The story was depressing and just got more depressing as it went along. If you're into tales about addicts obsessing and stalking people in a very pathetic sad embarrassing way then this is your jam. For me, I quit at the 3/4 mark wishing I hadn't wasted my time. I can't recommend this to anyone to be honest. Even fans of straight ""drama"" as opposed to thriller/mystery. Emily tried her best - but she was wasted here. Oh and there's a few familiar but older faces popping up that I hadn't seen in a while but that's not enough to suggest its worth watching.",The Girl on the Train
175,spencergrande6,Staid melodramatic domestic thriller,5,27 February 2017,Emily Blunt is really good in this but she's not believable because of the character she's playing. Without the schlumpy overweight sad-sack of the book there's no reason to believe a woman like Blunt would still be obsessing over some loser guy unable to move on with her life. I would have liked to see Allison Tolman in this role.The whole unreliable narrator aspect is the only interesting part of this otherwise it's all overheated nonsense that doesn't come together in a very interesting fashion. Most of it is a staid melodramatic domestic thriller. And it's all kind of sexist. Every woman's issues have to do with baby-related drama and how weak-willed they are when it comes to men.,The Girl on the Train
176,SpoilerAlertReviews,I can only imagine the book to be superior.,7,7 October 2016,"It's another highly anticipated, hyped novel-to-film adaptation, but there's something quite different about this one, being that Paula Hawkins' bestselling novel was only published last February starting at the No.1 slot for 13 consecutive weeks on the New York Times bestsellers list, only to return to No.1 again this January. It held the No.1 spot in the U.K. hardback chart for 20 weeks, the longest ever and is estimated to have already sold 11 million copies by August this year. So it's not surprising studios wanted to get hold of a screenplay and make the movie. I haven't read the book (no surprise there) but I can imagine the novel being the usual ""better than the film"" and that the suspense created by reading would be more intense. It's a great thriller with such an intriguing story surrounding the mysterious disappearance of one of the key characters. The story follows three ladies those lives are entwined by seduction and deceit, obsession and tragedy, but is pivotal to raving alcoholic, Rachel, brilliantly portrayed by Emily Blunt, those separation from husband leads her on a disillusioned spiral, out of control. Rebecca Ferguson plays the new wife Anna, who's under the constant watchful drunken eye of Rachel who doesn't necessarily know the understanding of keeping her distance. My this- year's-favourite, Haley Bennett graces us again with her talent, being her second film out at the same time in Magnificent Seven. It's actually hard to believe they're both the same actress. She play's Megan, the alluring seductress with a care-free, almost destructive nature. Besides the leading ladies, there's a really good cast giving good performances including Luke Evans, Justin Theroux, Edgar Ramirez and Allison Janney. All of which having key parts to the unfolding mystery. Director Tate Taylor does a slick job, creating a similar atmosphere to Gone Girl, which I think even the books have be compared, though actually quite different. It's more than just a ""what happen?"" or ""who done it?"" Story, throwing a few twists here and there to layer the enigma which all adds up towards the end. Unfortunately, whilst not completely expecting certain story elements to happen, the conclusion isn't so hard to predict and I wonder if the novel was able to conceal the secret more so. Really curious to know what fans of the novel think and if being set in New York as oppose to originally in London annoys people. I can't think of any good reason to change that apart from maybe not wanting to fly to the UK when they could simply swap the cities. Danny Elfman does an enchanting score as he always does, but I'm new to this style of Elfman music using chimes and soft beats. Quite similar to something Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross would have done, however, nothing was wholly memorable after the film had finished. It's unfortunately one of those films where once you've seen it, there no going back, no re- watchability purely because you're spoiled knowing the outcome but doesn't have the same enjoyment of films like Se7en or The Usual Suspects.It's a good film, good mystery story but it doesn't live up to the hype. Maybe the anticipation has ruin it for me and maybe I would have preferred the book. Either way, it's a worthy watch but nothing to get over excited about.

179,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,Women in trouble.,6,7 December 2020,"This is a silver screen adaptation of the titular bestselling mystery novel by Paula Hawkins, who has also authored more similar titles such as Into the Water and the forthcoming A Slow Fire Burning which is expected to be published on August 31st, 2021 by Doubleday. Though the film stays loyal to both the basic plot premise and narrative structure of the novel, some minor differences separate them. First of all, the book's setting is London while the movie takes place in New York, the protagonist, Rachel Watson, is much more damaged in the book than in the film, some characters have a much more significant role in Paula Hawkins's fictional universe than in Tate Taylor's adaptation and some other discrepancies that set the movie apart from the novel. Nevertheless, Erin Cressida Wilson (Chloe, Secretary) who wrote the screenplay succeeds in retaining the original source's mood and atmosphere, stressing the importance of the main characters' often irrational, erratic behavior that moves the story forward and keeps the audience engaged throughout the movie's runtime. The Girl on the Train features a strong cast with Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada, Edge of Tomorrow), Rebecca Ferguson (Snowman, Doctor Sleep), Haley Bennett (The Magnificent Seven, Music and Lyrics), and Justin Theroux (Mulholland Drive, American Psycho). Blunt gives an outstanding performance as Rachel, a troubled woman who has a severe drinking problem and spends her time stalking her ex-husband, Tom (J. Theroux), and his new wife, Anna (R. Ferguson). Haley Bennett's striking presence shines in her portrayal of Megan, an equally tormented female soul, whose disappearance constitutes the movie's great mystery.Rachel is a young woman whose life turned upside down when her husband, Tom, abandoned her and chose to live with his lover, Anna, who soon gets pregnant. After losing her job, due to her alcoholism, Rachel has nothing else to do but to commute every day to New York by train. Each day, she passes by her old house where Tom lives now along with Anna and their baby girl, Eve. Trying to fight the jealousy and pain that plagues her, she gets obsessed with another young couple living a few houses down: Megan and Scot Hipwell (Luke Evans). Rachel creates an idyllic picture of the couple, imagining only the best for both of them and their life together. When, one day, Rachel witnesses a suspicious kiss between Megan and an unknown man on the porch of her house, she becomes livid with rage as the picture of the perfect family gets cracked once and for all. The sight of Megan's betrayal will lead Rachel to a drinking binge that will render her unconscious at the end of the day. The day after, the police arrive at her house in order to ask her about Megan, who has disappeared without a trace. Rachel is certain that she has seen something the night before, but she can't remember a single thing as she suffered a complete blackout. She will have to put the fragments of her memory in order, to make sense of what had happened. The only thing she doesn't know is that the truth about what happened to Megan will affect her personally in ways that she can't even fathom.We watch the story unravel in an unconventional, non-linear format, through the eyes of the three female protagonists: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. The narration jumps back and forth in time, with many flashbacks and flashforwards that create a rather jumbled feeling to the audience, especially during the first half of the film. The narrative structure is adopted from the book but makes much less sense on the screen than on the page. The story is multi-layered and each narrative segment, corresponding to one of the three main characters is supposed to peel back an additional layer to the story. Nevertheless, the individual stories are not balanced and this uneven feeling is all the more evident as Rachel's perspective is undoubtedly dominant while Anna's is almost non-existent. In the last 30 minutes, the story becomes clearer and the final twist is nice, though a bit conventional, particularly for the fans of the genre.Overall, I would say that The Girl on the Train is an enjoyable mystery/thriller that has its flaws, nevertheless, wins the audiences' hearts mainly due to the great performances and dark cinematography that is reminiscent of David Lynch's work. It's a fit choice for the genre's aficionados who wish to spend a couple of entertaining hours in front of the screen and those who haven't read Paula Hawkins's novel will be surprised by the film's unorthodox narrative pattern. If you enjoyed David Fincher's Gone Girl, another splendid cinema adaptation of Gillian Flynn's titular novel that used similar narrative tropes, then you should give The Girl on the Train a chance, always keeping in mind that the two movies are not of equal stature.",The Girl on the Train
180,comps-784-38265,First half exciting but 2nd half predictable.7/10,7,10 October 2016,"I've not read the book so wasn't aware of the story. It starts of confusing (in a good way), you are not sure is Rachel (Blunt) the murderess, or just off her trolley, an alcoholic obsessed by her ex husband ?. A number of times you think you have guessed where it is leading but then it proves wrong. The first half of the film certainly teases you and draws you into Rachel's sodden sad little world. The 2nd half is rather like a magician who reveals the trick to quickly and then loses some of the 'magic'. After building up pace and tension, suddenly it all becomes predictable as to who the murderer really is. Don't get me wrong, it is a good film. Emily Blunt gives a great performance. But the ending was for me somewhat flat, leaving a 'burst bubble' disappointing sensation, having had so much teasing.A solid 7/10 for the film and 9/10 for Emily Blunts portrayal.",The Girl on the Train
181,rutzelb,"Good Mystery, Suspense and Tension",7,21 January 2017,"Rachel (Emily Blunt) is divorced from Tom (Justin Theroux) and an alcoholic who rides the train every day and is usually drunk. When Emily has too much to drink she has blackouts and cannot remember what happened during the blackouts. When she was married to Tom he was the one who told her what had happened and she was made to apologize. On the train she sees a woman in her backyard on a terrace and imagines she has an ideal home life with her husband who Rachel also sees from time to time with the woman. One day Rachel sees the woman on the terrace kissing someone not her husband. Later she learns that the woman now called Megan (Haley Bennett) is missing and later found dead. Rachel goes to the police with her concerns. Detective Riley (Allison Janney) suspects Rachel because Rachel cannot explain what happened during her most recent blackout when she got off the train to tell Megan she's a whore but ended up being beaten and bloodied and Rachel can't explain what happened to her. Did she kill Megan? Did the man who got off the train with Rachel kill Megan? Inquiring minds want to know. What you read above is all you need to know at this point. There is a lot more, of course, but when I watched I got confused about many things and it didn't help that many of the women kind of looked alike and separating them in my mind was difficult. Yes, yes, all will be revealed later on, but in the meantime we go here and there with this clue and that one, but cannot resolve anything. Of course, we do suspect that Rachel is the killer, but kept hoping that wasn't true. StillProduction wise this is very good as are the performances of all. We do see women being physically abused and we had to turn out heads away. Not good. We see sex acts at times, without really seeing anything, but you know what is going on.It is not so much that we need to see clues to determine who killed Megan. Hey, this isn't a Charlie Chan or a Colombo story. But there are many, many twists and turns. Okay, okay, you want a clue? Something Rachel is told is not true, but Rachel is told many, many things. Now go with that. Ha!Notables: Rebecca Ferguson as Ana, the woman Tom married after divorcing Rachel; Luke Evans as Scott, Megan's husband; Edgar Ramirez as Dr Kamel, Megan's therapist; and Lisa Kudrow as Martha, the wife of Tom's boss. There is good suspense and tension throughout. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, several times Nudity: No. Language: Yes.",The Girl on the Train

It wasn't as thrilling and suspenseful as ""Gone Girl"" but it worked. I'm quite sure the book is better but I really enjoyed this film. For those who didn't read the book, this is the type of film that has to be payed close attention too and where you can't miss anything, the type of films I like. To me it's a great who done it kind of film that will have the viewer thinking and wondering. Emily Blunt plays Rachel, a divorced woman who some how gets involved in a missing persons case. It sounds simple but it gets way deeper than that. Emily Blunt is perfect in this role. Her performance alone makes this film worth the watch. I recommend it.",The Girl on the Train
185,elenaphysics,It could have been good but it has not been..,4,14 October 2019,"This movie is around a main protagonist, a woman who is not in her right mind.
She is an alcoholic and she can not remember her actions while she is blacked out.
This scenario could easily be the schizophrenic scenario(someone has schizophrenia and they can not always separate real from fiction) or maybe dementia( they are not fully aware of what is happening ,they can not remember).
The only reason this alcohol problem exists is to serve the possible explanation that she could have killed someone without aknowledging it.
This is totally ridiculous. The only thing that it serves is to make the main character not likeable.
She has no life and she is stalking other people. And this is creepy and annoying.
And the whole thing about failing to get pregnant and getting cheated on,can not justify what she has become.
On the other hand we have the murdered woman, Meghan who clearly has deep psychological issues that derive from STUPIDITY.. We cannot sympathize with her about the loss of her baby because she killed it. Who takes a bath and holds a newborn baby in the bath and then falls asleep? It is not like the baby got sick or something. It was her careless and reckless behaviour that produced this outcome. So these people have like ""sad"" stories but in fact they are the villains in their own stories.
As for Anna, she deals with Rachel almost every day but she never blocks her number. Also in the end,why on earth did she pushed that wine bottle opener on her dying husbands neck? I mean she could have been accused for killing him on the first place. What was her motive(besides being psychopath)?
And moreover WHY did Tom kill Meghan? He had already dumped his 1st wife for someone else, why could not he deal leaving Anna or being a possible father to Meghan's baby?
In the whole film it is clearly shown that Anna is not important to him at all. It is not like he could not afford to lose her.
There are giant plotholes where the film is dumped in and rests in peace.
The only thing that it is nice is the decent acting which portrays the effect alcohol and betrayal have on some people..",The Girl on the Train

The Autistic Reviewers got to see this at a Premiere tonight. Sometimes being the only Autistic Males in the cinema and being surrounded by chicks is not always comfortable, but nonetheless no one complained! We had never read the book so it was going to be a mystery for us what sort of a film to expect.The pacing goes along nicely, while slow to start off...such as introduction to the characters etc, but it does take off quite well once it gets going. Emily Blunt's performance as Rachel was truly breathtaking. Emily Blunt keeps proving more and more that she's a terrific actress. She had to play multiple emotions and personalities in this film that you believe everything she is doing/saying. We weren't such a fan of Rebecca Ferguson or Haley Bennett much, but to be fair the main focus was on Rachel (Emily Blunt.) Cinematography was beautiful as was the Direction by Tate Taylor.It does keep you wandering who the killer is and you can never figure it out. You sometimes never even know if a murder even took place! Great suspense and great game guessing. The Autistic Reviewers recommend this one. While it's not a masterpiece, it's definitely worth seeing in the theater. 4/5 stars 8/10- The Autistic Reviewers.",The Girl on the Train
187,dale-51649,Drunk fat ladies and psycho nymphos blame everything on the man,2,1 October 2017,"This film reflects the worst of the new Hollywood mantra ""women and kids can do whatever they want, men don't matter"". Or the other ""It's always the man's fault""The main character is a drunk fat lady who stalks her X hubby and his new bimbo wife, then inserts herself into a murder case that has major cred problems. The bimbo wife is the type who says stuff like ""when I look into my babies eyes I feel like my heart is going to explode with love"", so caveat:some lines may induce vomiting.There is a nympho-psychopath down the street who unfortunately is very hot, so if you are a man in her life, you probably get lucky but, eventually it sucks to be YOU..... WAIT,wait, it gets better: her vagina slinging habit is blamed on , guess who? Her husband because he : abuses her? NO,....he does not love her? NO... because he WORKS TOO MUCH!!That's right, if you can't find a fault, it is abusive to be away from the house because you had to work to pay for all her crap.......The old feminist escape value ""well, he was a nice guy, but he wan't there"" (had to go to Cleveland for two days for that old continuing ed, and....The piece does not have so much of a feminist bent, as a contortion. It portrays women who lie, cheat, steal, murder; and also do what many women even revile:home wreck. Yet, the only clever thing about the the writing is that , no matter how revolting the women's behavior is (even the hot one's-who are usually forgiven anyway) , no matter how embarrassingly sleazy their selfish deeds are (eg ""I didn't enjoy the sex so much as my ability to make him COME RUNNING)-It gets all tied up neatly at the end by blaming, who else? THE MAN!!As a baby boomer I don't know what effect it would have had on me if I had grown up with male genitalia watching this kind of stuff. Would I also button my top button of my shirt uncomfortably up? Would I wrap myself in a male burka and hide in my parents basement for life? Perhaps, if you watch ""hot Tub Time Machine"" you will see what kind of ""man"" is growing into adulthood today, in the form of the tag along nephew.

188,danielharden,Trainwreck,2,11 October 2016,"Based on a best selling novel and with a huge marketing campaign to back the film, The Girl On The Train oddly became one of the most anticipated films of the Autumn to Christmas period... But instead of being the Guardians of the Galaxy of this period the film fairs as well as this years Suicide Squad. The Girl On The Train is absolutely terrible and I feel rather sorry for Emily Blunt who I feel is left alone trying to salvage this wreckage.The film is so melodramatic that it is physically exhausting. The script is I feel mainly to blame as many lines, especially Megan's, feel extremely pretentious and I can't help but roll my eyes almost every time someone speaks. Not only is the dialogue over the top but the characters are written in such an unlikable way and the story's progression is simply boring with one or two exceptions. I also took issue with some of the plot points but I am unaware if this fault lies with the book itself, or the film has adapted it and executed it in such a poor way... I think I'll give the book the benefit of the doubt and stick to the film as this must have been a Best Selling Book for a reason.The characters in this film are extremely unlikable to the point that anything they say or do annoyed me. The frustrating thing about these characters, and this is again Megan's character mainly, is that they are often perfectly happy and fine but seem to go out their way to screw their lives up (with the obvious exception of Rachel). Megan was a huge issue for me as she had a seemingly happy life, she worked in galleries and with children and had a husband who loved her... But she just has to sleep around with the entire male cast to the point that you feel exactly what Rachel felt when she saw her from the train. Megan's character is rage inducing and for that I simply didn't care if she was alive or dead but instead wanted to give the culprit a medal... But even the culprit is a frustratingly irritating ass.The best thing about this film by far is Emily Blunt's acting. I would call it the films saving grace but this film is far from saving. Blunt's performance of an alcoholic, voyeuristic, lonely woman who takes the same train everyday to watch the ""perfect couple"" is great. Of course the lines she is given aren't that great and her character is again irritatingly stupid I'm surprised Alison Janney didn't wack handcuffs on her, but as the plot thickens so does your understanding of her character and so she is excused. As I said earlier I feel rather sorry for Blunt who is tasked with holding the whole film together, but it sadly isn't enough even though she tried so hard and got so far, in the end it didn't even matter.Overall, The Girl On The Train is one of the worst films of the year in my opinion. The Suicide Squad of the Autumn - December movie season. Emily Blunt tries her best but it isn't enough to save this melodramatic mess. Fan's of the book I'm sorry if I offend and I'm sure the book is good and worth the time to read... But the film is simply not worth the 112 minutes and the anger it generates. Stand aside Amy Schumer this film is the real Trainwreck.",The Girl on the Train
189,nickboldrini,"Clever, but unengaging thriller",6,14 April 2018,"The story is a twisting thriller, in which it gradually emerges that nothing is quite as it seems. The gradual reveal of the truth is what kept me interested in watching this, because I found it unengaging emotionally - possibly because the lead character is unsympathetic. That changes slightly as the story progresses, but it happened too slowly and I didn't care enough about any of the characters to be interested in their arc. What kept me watching was to see whodunnit, in the same way that you want to know the answer to a puzzle even though you have given up being interested in solving it.",The Girl on the Train
190,cashbacher,Temporal shifts and false memories confuse the viewer,8,23 March 2020,"Most murder mystery stories start some background to introduce the characters, have a murder or two and then sequentially step through the investigation. Generally, there will be hints and clues dropped, some of which are relevant, but others that are meant to distract and confuse. In this one, the distract and confuse is done by temporal shifting and false memories, where there will be snippets from some time in the past and recollections that are sometimes more of a delusion by transfer of role in the events.
Rachel is a woman that commutes on a train along a track with water on one side and the back of a row of houses on the other. She generally sits on the side of the houses, so she occasionally sees the people in their back yards, or on their decks. Two of the people that she regularly sees are Scott and Megan and they are often embracing. Yet, one day she sees Megan with another man.
Rachel is heavy into alcohol, so she often has blackouts and her memory is very unreliable. When Megan turns up missing and then found dead, Rachel tries to get her mind in order and put her memories back in the realm of reality. For it is clear early on that she was likely the last person other than the murderer to see Megan alive.
The story bounces back and forth and Rachel is depicted as very unstable to the point of delusional, which is what she is. She is also a stalker, appearing suddenly at the home of her ex-husband and his new wife. She once even walked into their home and took their baby outside while the wife was sleeping.
Like a good murder mystery, the viewer is kept puzzled until the very end when all of it falls into place. Whether Rachel ever gets over the bottle and makes something of herself remains an unknown. The performances are excellent, all the usual suspects remain ambiguous to the extent that the viewer cannot determine the guilty.",The Girl on the Train

200,vsks,The Destination Isn't Worth the Two-Hour Trip,5,18 October 2016,"This movie thriller (trailer) written by Erin Cressida Wilson and directed by Tate Taylor is based on Paula Hawkins's runaway best-selling novel. Cognoscenti in the crime fiction world consider the book distinctly overrated, so an investment of two hours in the movie theater may be preferable to a dozen hours of reading. Maybe this was a bad choice. As Christy Lemire at RogerEbert.com says, ""The Girl on the Train is good trash. At least as a novel, it is. As a film, however, it's not even that."" The story is initially engaging, thanks primarily to excellent acting by Emily Blount as Rachel, the alcoholic protagonist. She knows her husband Tom had an affair and left their childless marriage primarily because of her drinking but seems to be spinning ever-further out of control, a vodka-in-the-water-bottle kind of drinker. I'm not persuaded by critics who say the film withholds pertinent information, because it is mostly told from Rachel's point of view. We see the world as she does—none too clearly—with a few scenes from the also-limited perspective of the other two principal women. Rachel commutes into the city every day from Westchester (London in the novel), and her train passes behind their former house. She can see him (played by Justin Theroux), his new wife (Rebecca Ferguson), and their baby. She also sees the devoted neighbor couple (Luke Evans and Haley Bennett), whose love seems perfect in these tantalizing glimpses. If her city job were real, exposing herself to hurt with this voyeurism might be torture. Since her job is imaginary, it's pathological. You will have guessed that the neighbor couple's relationship is more complicated than Rachel apprehends, and when the woman turns up missing, Rachel's obsessions and her hazy perceptions create havoc. It's always fun to see Allison Janney, here as a police detective investigating the disappearance and trying to make sense of Rachel's ""evidence."" Ultimately, the motivations that drive what turns out to be a six-sided story of love and lust, deceit and dangerous truth-telling are deeply clichéd, and there are a few too many close-ups of a befuddled Rachel. The Girl on the Train is a ride to nowhere terribly interesting.",The Girl on the Train

I love this film and can't help but watch every time its on, but it's not AMAZING. i added the extra 2/3 points because i do think it's a good film, so i wanted my sister and mother in law to watch it while they were here this weekend. now i am no good with violence, but this movie is tame. or so i thought. the end made my sister freak out and run in and out of the room in a panic (she's 37 by the way) her mother in law was TRIPPING. so if a movie can make you do that, i'd say it's a damn good film. the story is solid, with just enough sordid confusion to make you confused as to whose story you're following. Emily Blunt, of course, is a star. what a great film for her to get to prove what she can do. (being pregnant IRL while filming i'm sure helped the 'alcoholic mess' look) the greatness in this film, like in most great films, is the ending. that ending where you go 'OH CRAP!'. because you didn't see it coming. there's so many brilliant red herring's. definitely recommended, although i can assure you it will not traumatize. my sister is just special.

Except in a few minor changes, the movie is loyal to the novel and I can hardly expect any betterment in any of the areas. May be they all are so obsessed with Gone Girl that they thought giving it a poor rating would be a justice to that movie.In fact, I like both Gone Girl and this one and they are unique. Coincidentally the authors of both the great books are female.Well, that may be a pre-context. Coming back to this movie, it's an not an edge of the seat thriller. It takes time to build the milieu. It takes a bit time to develop the characters. But when it does, it just flies. Emily Blunt as alcoholic Rachel is just terrific. Rebecca Ferguson, right from Mission Impossible is wonderful to me. The rest of the casts do justice to the roles. But what plays the role of the protagonist is the bleak, cold, death like environment all around the movie.

206,antony-1,"Turgid, depressing, without merit",3,8 May 2017,"This film is hard work.The first problem is that none of the characters are relateable or sympathetic. I just don't care for anyone. Books often give you insight into people's minds, so inevitably when you put something like this into a movie you end up with lots of self-aware and overly exposition-laden dialogue.Girl on the Train - for a film that is titled this, has very little on the train. I know this seems an odd complaint, but it seems like a plot device for about five minutes. There's no follow through. She rides past a couple of times, but this is undermined by the fact that she lived on the street. It should be called The Girl Who Lived Two Doors Down.The plot points are pretty predictable: case in point pregnant woman dies. We know two people who aren't the father. Hmm who could it be. Could it be the only other male actor in the film? Oh yes it could! What a motive eh for murder? Didn't see that coming.The main plot twist - which incidentally was delivered by a woefully underused Lisa Kudrow - is delivered flat, and provides no exciting moment for the film. It's ""Oh here's the twist... now everything will be black and white... man bad, women can murder because man deserved it... the end.""

Then listened to a few hours of the book overnight. From a cinematic viewpoint, the movie felt like Alfred Hitchcock had come back to life. Wow.The overall tone of the book and movie is morose and requires total attention to detail to not get lost in the droning, depressive quality of the people and become confused. Comparisons with ""Gone Girl,"" had turned me off to reading or seeing this earlier, because I didn't care for the movie ""Gone Girl"" and the book didn't hold my attention.I found this film to be technically excellent and the performances are Oscar worthy. Now reading reviews and seeing lousy critical reviews, it is kind of a shock. Seriously, Emily Blunt in particular, but the entire cast was perfect.The complexity of the story is put together so well, the inherent confusion of so many flashbacks and narratives from the book, is remarkable screen writing and the direction never fails.This film is the best movie I've seen in 2016, next to ""The Witch,"" another critically slammed masterpiece of filmmaking.",The Girl on the Train

She's too drunk, too caught up in her own head and, at least until a twist half an hour from the end reveals otherwise, seemingly wholly to blame for her situation. This made watching most of the film much more of a chore than it had to be.Secondly, after all is revealed I realized that the whole movie was basically 2 hours of waiting for Emily Blunt to remember she had actually seen the missing girl getting into the killer's car on the night of her murder.

No offense to them (or you, if you are one of them), but the point here is to review the FILM - not to compare and contrast the film to the novel (or to anything else, for that matter). If you want to write a review of the book, go to Goodreads.com and write it there! This site is for the film, and it's what I want to know about. All of these reviews on here telling me about the book, and then giving a poor rating because the film isn't exactly like the book, are irrelevant and out of place. Let's talk about the FILM....)And yes, it's a very good one. Emily Blunt does such a masterful job of playing an alcoholic social outcast, I agree with some others on here wondering why she wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award. It's that good. She plays one of three women around whom the story largely revolves (Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Bennett are the others). These three are all loosely connected in various ways that are not obvious at first but, through flashbacks and story shifts, we are gradually shown how they tie together. One of the three goes missing and the plot then shifts to solving that mystery. Saying much more than this will ruin the story so I'll draw the line there. But I will say I found this to be highly entertaining and was constantly shifting my opinion as to who was the guilty one. At one point I guessed right (as it turned out) but I changed my opinion based on what was happening, only to find out I had been right 20 minutes ago! But that's the beauty of this film - just when you think you've got it figured out, you are given a new shred of information that makes you question everything you'd accepted before. That's good story-telling and worthy of acclaim. It's not a stretch to say ""The Girl on the Train"" comes from the same mold as the Agatha Christie and Alfred Hitchcock classics. If you like those, you'll probably like this too.8/10. Effective and intriguing mystery that deserves a much higher rating than it's current 6.5 here. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Yes.",The Girl on the Train
211,jsaleem-89705,A over hyped & Over rated movie,2,21 August 2019,"I watched this movie
I go cinema with big expectations but very disappointed ,Script was so week,Nothing special with story line,twist was Average",The Girl on the Train
212,v-ley,Please give it a look,8,28 March 2017,"I personally didn't read the book but I heard my fair share. The movie while very hard to replicate the book, does a really good job, in my opinion of doing just that. I don't think it could have been done much better and certainly not with a different cast. It doesn't keep you on your toes because it's pretty much a ""given"" from the first 30 minutes. It's only after that that you start to understand there is something terribly wrong or not what it seems. Trust me and stay to the end, it is well worth it. I think Emily did a wonderful job as an alcoholic, maybe at times, too well & a little sloppy. Some of those scenes could have been trimmed down. The movie is worth it.",The Girl on the Train
213,wildsparrow16,This train ride will rock you - don't miss it.,7,18 January 2017,"""You are like one of those needy, abused dogs that just keeps getting up and coming back..."" Emily Blunt gives an Oscar worthy performance as a sad, lonely, deeply troubled alcoholic. She cannot draw the line between reality, obsession and fantasy. Unfortunately, she will need to in order to save what remains of her sanity. To call this movie a love triangle would be inaccurate as there are simply too many people involved. Just when you think you have it nailed - trust me, you don't. The atmosphere is moody, the acting superb, the script is perfection. It does take awhile to build, and build it does. While this movie is by no means a chick flick, it does delve deeply into the psyche of women - at least the ones in the film - their dark secrets , their bonds, their intuition. If I had only one criticism, it would be that the lead character's alcoholism is exploited. But I guess it has to be since it is an intrinsic part of the lead role.",The Girl on the Train

215,VintageSoul56,Muddled Mess ****Spoiler Alert by Mentioning Aspect of Plot****,4,30 October 2016,"I'm giving this a 4 because I do like Emily Blunt, but the movie itself is really a 1. I read another review titled ""Gone Girl, Without the Tension and Emotion"". I couldn't have said it better myself. The one thing that rang true, was the fact that the main female character was made to blame herself. That happens so much in relationships. I couldn't even understand the dialog that the main character was thinking or the dialog in general. That was the first 30 to 45 minutes. What is it with movies the last several years? The sound editing leaves a lot to be desired or the director needs to have their actors speak plainly so that the audience can understand what they are saying. I have nothing wrong with my hearing, but I can't seem to understand dialog in movies anymore, due to whispering, muddling or non enunciation. Come on directors and sound people, aren't we, the audience, supposed to know what's going on and isn't understanding and hearing the dialog part of that? Anyway, save your money and see ""Gone Girl"" instead or again.",The Girl on the Train

219,parleon-thedon,The Girl on the Train - review: The Human Condition,8,7 October 2016,"Non-Spoilers: The Girl on The Train is a good movie. It's filled with suspense, drama, and mystery; and it features love, infidelity, loss, heartbreak, loneliness, depression, anxiety, alcoholism, mental unconsciousness, self-mental abuse, desire, sex, and murder. This movie will keep you guessing until the very end. If you want to enjoy a good movie about the human condition (which is acted out superbly by the way), then check out The Girl on The Train.Spoilers: Viewers should watch this movie more than once. I don't believe that one viewing will help an audience participant fully comprehend its true nature. I think that audience viewers will be anticipating something similar to Gone Girl, they want to experience a full mystery story, but what they get instead is a story about the mental condition.Rachel can't get pregnant, and so she turns to the bottle. Tom (Rachel's ex-husband) is a complete as$hole. He cheats on his wife because she can't conceive. Tom mentally damages Rachel by lying to her about her blackout phases. She has visions about what happened to her during one of her moments, but they're all falsities created by Tom.Megan is (in her own words) a whore. She likes to sleep around with different men. Does she enjoy having sex with multiple partners, maybe? Megan wants a change in her life. She doesn't want to be with her husband anymore. Scott (Megan's husband) is a control freak. He has sex with her when he pleases. He wants her to conceive, but he's convinced that she doesn't want children. Unbeknown to Scott, Megan has the past. She's haunted by memories of the day she lost her child. She loved her child, but one accident proved to be something fatal, and it forever changed her life.Anna was Tom's flame while he was married to Rachel. Anna and Tom are currently together, but Anna suspects infidelity during their marriage. Why Anna decided to fu*k a married person is beyond me. Why did she knowingly marry a cheating as$hole? Anna and Tom currently have a baby together. Anna is afraid of Rachel because one day, the front door was unlocked, Rachel let herself in, and then she took the baby outside. Anna panicked trying to find her baby. Once Anna went outside, she found Rachel and the baby. Rachel wasn't harming the baby she was just holding it. Anna pleaded, ""Put my baby down!"" Rachel gently put the baby on the ground and then ran away. Unbeknown to Anna, Rachel was heavily intoxicated. She just wanted to hold the baby and feel what that love was like. Rachel knew that she would never be able to have children, and she just wanted to feel that love she knew would never be possible. Rachel wanted a loving husband, the baby, and the fairytale happy ending.Megan decided to see a shrink. Dr. Kamal Abdic is trying to help Megan deal with her current situations. Megan (being who she is and knowing it) tries to engage in sexual activity with her therapist. At first glance, it may seem that he's sleeping with her, but that's truly not the case. All he wants to do is help her get through her (I don't give a fu*k) phase. In the end, the doctor helps her realize why she's doing what she's doing. Megan's guilt for the death of her child sent her on a downward spiral. She's coping with her guilt by sleeping around.Rachel and Megan are completely fleshed out. I received the knowledge of their past, and that helped me understand their way of thinking.I didn't know what the hell Anna was doing.Tom's a complete mentally abusive as$hole. He sleeps around because he's tired of sleeping with the same woman consistently.Scott is shallow.Dr. Kamal Abdic just happens to be present.Overall, The Girl on the Train may be overshadowed by its mystery plot, but its true nature lies within its character's mental conditioning. Some characters are not there while others are just present. I will say that this movie does suffer from an overly complicated plot structure. For Example, a character called ""Man in the Suit"" is overused during the first act. The only use for the character is to throw the audience off. The mystery of the movie is not that good. Two characters certainly flesh out the movie and turn it into more than what it is. The Girl on the Train is about mental conditioning. The things we go through in the past can sometimes shape our future. Never make assumptions about people. We never have a clue about other people until we receive the full story.Final Grade: B+",The Girl on the Train
220,Nobody-27,"If we take out misandry, there is almost nothing left",2,1 January 2017,"I can't help but think of the Seinfeld episode in which Jerry complains that a dentist changed his religion to Jewish just so he could tell jokes about Jews. The priest asks him ""And this offends you as a Jewish person?"" to which Jerry answers ""No, it offends me as a comedian!"" Well, while I don't take to misandry or misogyny well, I am offended even more by the film's storytelling regardless of its shallow theme. This film about an alcoholic who maybe sees something, is purposefully misleading you, the viewer, and skipping important details so that you are left wondering until the very end. It's not like in reality those things are hard to find out; no, they are skipped so that you don't know where in time or place you are, or even who you are watching.Unfortunately, this trick is used and abused whenever the filmmaker has nothing to say and when there is no interesting plot to develop. You can get people interested in a film by telling a good story, or you can admit that you have no plot by simply skipping through time, back and forth, skipping over important details, give us glimpses which are entirely false, and so on. Some people fall for it, but some of us do not - we know a good story when we see it, and when we don't, we tend to stay away. I only watched this train-wreck in slow motion to see if I were right, and I was. However, I must admit, the director surpassed my expectations in being a poor storyteller. I could tell within first five minutes that the director was clueless due to lack of motivation for all the characters' somber tone. Director is an actor himself, but has a poor understanding of that word - motivation. People don't just get sad or angry, they need a reason. If you don't want to show the reason, at least give a clue. No such a thing here. We are expected to believe that these people are screwed up just because the director says so. At least good thing is - there is no way I would ever watch any of his movies ever again.All in all, this is a story that could have been OK, were it not for forced ""psycho"" drama, contrived story telling, and outright misleading audiences to achieve some level of interest. If you like such cheap tricks, then this film is for you. If you prefer interesting stories to contrived ones, then stay well away.The only redemption is Emily Blunt's performance. She never fails, and she is brilliant here, again. She made this film watchable, hence two stars from me, rather than zero. Everything else though was not worth my effort; and this depressing piece of toxic junk does need much effort to follow and watch, if nothing, at least due to incomprehensible dialogues (another cheap trick; you think there is something interesting you missed, if you don't hear it!).From ridiculous premise and unbelievable characters, and all men doing something despicable, to the nutty main character and everyone else lacking a moral compass, and above all - poor motivations for any of the above, this film is a best to be avoided.",The Girl on the Train

I knew next to nothing going in about what this movie was about, which is probably the best way to go into this movie (so in this review I'm not going to discuss the plot at all, just how I felt about the movie - it's better this way). I knew Emily Blunt was in the movie and that it was based on a novel and that's really about this it. Despite all this, I actually liked this movie.Who hasn't observed strangers from a distance and imagined our own life stories for them? What if we got lost in our own imagined thoughts and turned them into a dangerous obsession? It's an interesting premise on which to base a story.The movie kept me guessing; it wasn't predictable.

225,RLTerry1,"A tastes great, less filling, David Fincher-esque flick",6,7 October 2016,"DreamWorks Pictures and Reliance Entertainment's The Girl on the Train directed by Tate Taylor and starring Emily Blunt is the much anticipated film adaptation of the best-selling novel of the same name written by Paula Hawkins. With a slow windup and quick delivery, the suspense thriller plays off as a knockoff combination of Hitchcock's Rear Window and Fincher's Gone Girl. Despite the wild success of the novel, this film adaptation appears to have jumped the tracks. In fact, fans of the novel may find that this translation from page to screen is a bumpy ride. The film is not without its high points; the plot is certainly intriguing and Blunt's portrayal of the protagonist is excellent; however, the film fails to truly create that sense of dread and heighten the anxiety levels of the audience. There were many missed opportunities to tighten up the writing during the windup and spend more time on a successful nail-biting punch during the third act. It's one of those films that feels like Act I is 2/3 of the movie with Acts II/III being 1/6 each. Lots of verbal exposition when exposition through showing would have been more effective. Don't get me wrong; it was a fun suspense thriller and the plot twist and turning point from Act II to III was quite the shocker; but, the film just never seemed to move beyond the surface level.If I had to sum up the film adaption of The Girl on the Train, I would concisely put it this way: under-developed. From the locations themselves to the writing (screenplay) to the plot and characters, this mystery-thriller-suspense movie fails to impact the audience and truly elicit a strong emotional response. Tapping into emotions and affecting anxiety levels is paramount for suspense-thrillers. After such a long, drawn-out wind up and the rushed showdown, this film does not live up to the hype that the novel generated. Having not read the novel, I cannot comment on differences or even how the movie could have been done better; but screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson could have done a better of job of creative a cinematic story fit for the silver screen. The flaws of the film so not stop with the writing, but director Tate Taylor's vision, for the best-seller, should be checked because it appears as though he may need glasses. If it was not for Blunt's commitment to the character of Rachel, the film would have had very little entertainment value. This is one of those films that was saved by attaching excellent talent.This film falls into the same sub-genre as Gone Girl. But, what made Gone Girl so successful was the exceptional direction from David Fincher and simply the fact that author Gillian Flynn also wrote the screenplay. If an author can be trained to write the screenplay of the film adaption of their literary work, then that is always the best approach because they know the characters and plot better than anyone. Fincher also includes many WTF moments and treats the camera more than lens through which to witness a visual story but creates magic that takes the audience out of the threats and transports them into the movie. The Girl on the Train has a great premise and intriguing plot. The foundation IS there for a great movie adaptation. The writing not only doesn't do the book justice, from what I have read, but fails to create a cinematic experience as well.Other than Rachel, the rest of the cheaters are two-dimensional. We are given just enough information to make them mildly interesting, but the character development just isn't there. Much like the detective in Gone Girl was as interesting to follow as the main cast, Detective Riley should have been just as well developed for this film. Rachel's ex-husband, his wife, their nanny, and the nanny's husband have the makings of a cast of characters filled with lies, deceit, betrayal, dark secrets, and intrigue (and to some extent, that comes across in the movie); however, all those elements are touched on but never truly fleshed out. Do those elements have a place in the plot of the film? Yes. But, do they play a dynamic a role as they could have? Not particularly. Most everything in the film is very surface level. All the makings are there for a film that could be nearly as thrilling as Gone Girl, but it's all superficial. When location scouting for a film that relies upon houses, transportation, and proximity that are intricate to the plot, it is important to treat them AS cast. The two main houses and the train in this movie almost feel like they were selected out of convenience. Nothing about the locations or train grabbed me or generated a significant emotional response. However, I liked the proximity of the train to the houses and how the lake is on one side and the neighborhood on the other.If you're looking for a fun suspense-thriller to watch this weekend, then this one may fit the bill. But, you won't get nearly the 'train' ride that you experienced in Gone Girl. Emily Bunt demonstrates a dynamic acting prowess compared to other characters that she has brought to life. Whether you choose to watch this film in a local cinema near you or wait for it to be on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime, or HBO, the experience will be the same. At the end of the day, it's a good movie but a poor film.",The Girl on the Train

228,Jona1988,Bland and forgettable,5,31 October 2016,"I have read the novel this is based on. I really liked it and while I did not think it was brilliant as Gone Girl it was still a thrilling page-turner. Many people compared the novel to Gone Girl. However unlike Gone Girl which was adapted into a worthy movie The Girl on the Train is not. And even if I just forgot about the book and judged it as a movie on its own it doesn't change anything. The Girl on the Train is a bad movie. The movie is totally boring. Kind of strange because the plot is on the whole good, might not be award winning material in my opinion but it's a good and cruel mystery thriller which this movie somehow fails to make the least thrilling. The movie has this grey, bleak look which should be fitting to the tone of the story but it does not completely work anyway. The movie looks dull and unimaginative. Still I do have some slight positive things to point out. Sometimes when books are adapted into movies viewers that aren't familiar with the story before have a hard time following it. Here however I think that most will at the end have a reasonable grip of what was going on. So the writing for the movie seemed OK but somehow they did not manage to translate it to the screen. Some words about the acting which is the best thing in the movie. At first I was sceptical about Emily Blunt as the main character Rachel. She is a good actress but I did not think she would fit the character. But it turns out she actually does. Both her appearance and her performance really embodies this messed up individual that Rachel is, one will feel sympathy for her. The other actresses are very good as well. But Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson look so similar in this. I know the characters are supposed to but in some scenes I was not right away sure if I was looking at Meagan or Anna. The main male actors do fine even if neither is very memorable. Now unfortunately on to the thing in the movie that annoyed me among the most. The exposition all the clunky exposition. And closely connected to this is the narration and also the flashbacks. I felt there was quite a lot of narration in this movie. Exposition is necessary I know, and I know it's easier to deliver in a novel. Still a skillful filmmaker can weave it into the narrative so it feels like it comes naturally. Not so here unfortunately, there is some really clumsy exposition. Scenes where characters are like just talking facts in a way that no one would do in reality. But they need to give us viewers the background information somehow. And so the narration, narration can be a great addition in some cases but sometimes I feel it is just used in lazy ways or because the director does not know how to show the feelings of the characters in the acting and dialogue. Unfortunately this is the latter. Often show don't tell is the preferable. Some narration it feels like a slap in your face. The filmmakers screaming: here is what is happening and this is how she is feeling. There are also several flashbacks in this, there is even flashbacks inside of flashbacks. I feel the flashbacks come without any clear way of telling you. So at times I was not aware of where in the story we were. Tate Taylor has directed good movies but not this time. To rap this up The Girl on the Train is a thriller that is not thrilling. Emily Blunt does her best and there is a good plot here but they have totally not succeeded in translating it to the screen. A mystery without suspense.",The Girl on the Train
229,imranahmedsg,"It's a slow train, don't expect much excitement on the journey ...",6,16 May 2019,"The Girl on the Train directed by Tate Taylor based on the best selling novel by Paula Hawkins was perhaps better left as a novel. For the first hour of the almost two hour long movie it was difficult to follow the plot or make a mental note of the characters. Yes, the pace improved in the second half and, at the very least, the main characters were no longer confusing.The story revolves around an alcoholic divorcee woman, Rachel, who becomes obsessed with a couple living in a house she passes on her daily commute into Manhattan. One day during these daiy voyeuristic commutes Rachel witnesses the woman kissing a man who is not her husband. Having been through a divorce with an unfaithful husband - who lives in their jointly purchased house a few doors down from the couple she obsesses about - Rachel loses it.Rachel, known for making unannounced visits to her ex-husband's home, subsequently tries to visit the apparently unfaithful woman (Megan) to give her a piece of her mind. Unfortunately for Rachel as she was in her usual drunken stupor she has little recollection of what transpired during that fateful visit. Unfortunate because that night Megan mysteriously disappeared.The story slowly unravels and the viewer pieces together the puzzle, all the while learning more about each character. (Yes, you know the old adage: don't judge a book by its cover.)The Girl on the Train is billed as a psychological thriller on many move sites. That's a fallacy. At best it's a mystery - albeit incuding a side role for a mysterious psychiatrist. Only the strength of the acting held it together with great performances put in by the cast.

I must admit to not entirely concentrating on the film, whilst I was watching it. But what did come across, was Emily Blunt acting her socks off. She is a phenominal actress. This role is about as far removed from Mary Poppins as you could possibly get.

231,keyope,Confusing,3,11 January 2017,"I was really looking forward to this film. I'd considered buying the book but decided to wait for the film. Knowing that the book upon release was touted as ""this year's Gone Girl"" I hoped the film would be as good as Gone Girl. It's not. It has a terrible ending like Gone Girl but none of the suspense or mystery of the other film. It starts off slowly with a voice-over from Emily Blunt's character to set the scene. This feels like you're listening to someone read the book to you. It goes on too long, but when it's over Blunt's character talks to a few people on the train but even the dialogue just sounds like she's narrating her life story. After about half an hour the plot kicks in. From here it's a mix of entertaining pieces mixed in with scenes where Blunt's character acts as a detective (albeit one who's permanently wasted and can't remember a bleeding thing). There are a few flashbacks too, some of which are quite interesting. But I was still confused as to what was really going on, which can be a good thing if you care about the characters, but they're all so miserable and depressed. And they're all having affairs with each other. The final act kicks in and the twists start coming thick and fast. Some are good, some are lazy and obvious, but the film definitely picks up pace at this point. But then comes the final reveal and it's a real eye roller. Spoilers coming up - Emily Blunt's ex husband turns out to be a serial cheat and generally all round meanie. His former boss, played by Lisa Kudrow warns that she had to fire him because he was having affairs. What? If that's a sackable offence, it's no wonder unemployment is so high. So then you get the Gone Girl ending, only ramped up to eleven. Because Blunt's ex husband is so awful (He cheats, he lies, he's killed someone who he got pregnant etc), he gets stabbed to death by Blunt and his current wife. And everyone lives happily ever after. At the end of the day this is yet another film that rams home the message that all men have affairs and don't appreciate their wives, and in this case, that's an offence punishable by death without any repercussions.",The Girl on the Train

For some reason, I left it playing and kinda watched it. It was a very slow burn. The first 30 minutes were a snoozer. But then just after my cutoff time, the plot started moving forward. If you are going to watch this, plan on being bored for 30 minutes but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And you really have to watch it. There are so many entanglements that you won't know who is doing what to whom and why without really paying attention.It is worth it. Don't want to give anything away but it has a real ending (unlike lots of modern movies) and it will satisfy you with the way it all comes out. You CANNOT predict the ending.

The only thing that saves this movie is Blunt's Amazing Performance accompanied by a stellar direction but not fully polished. As a thriller Mystery it works absolutely perfect but the story doesn't quite match its script which actually disturbs the whole momentum. As expected from the hype for both novel and the movie , its delivers its shocking twist towards the end followed by yet another shocking twist which was unexpected and surprising but was not portrayed very well. The only good thing I found in the movie that is the only thing you should watch it for is Blunt's performance which is a career high for her and also should Grant an Oscar nom for Best Performance by a Female.As speaking for the story I can't say much this being a spoiler free review but all I can say is story is actually great , its intriguing , characters are well portrayed , sex scenes are dull.So if you don't care about a lousy script then you can watch this mystery or if you care then well read the book. Again even though I rated it 7/10 its 10/10 for Emily Blunt's performance.",The Girl on the Train

238,bartonj2410,Thriller that serves up a real mystery,8,9 October 2016,"We've all experienced the same monotonous train commute to work in our lives at some point. You go by the same places and see the same faces each and every day. None of us have quite had a commute that changes our lives quite like Rachel Watson in The Girl on the Train though.Emily Blunt stars as Rachel Watson, an alcoholic divorcée who takes the same train to work each day. On her journey, Rachel fantasises about the relationship of Scott (Luke Evans) and Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett), who live a few doors down from her ex-husband, Tom (Justin Theroux), and his new wife, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson).Rachel's unstable state leads her on a downward spiral that sees her embroiled in a missing persons investigation that will change her life forever.Based on the best-selling novel by Paula Hawkins, The Girl on the Train is a mystery thriller that reminded me of David Fincher's Gone Girl, which is not a bad thing at all. Now, while I don't think this is a better film than Gone Girl, I do think it serves up a worthy mystery that kept me guessing right up until the twist/reveal later on in the story.The narrative is told from the point of view of the three main female characters; Rachel, Anna and Megan. It could have easily become quite convoluted and messy yet Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay allows things to move along smoothly and without any confusion.A lot of my hopes for this film were depending on the twist/reveal that would undoubtedly arrive in a mystery like this. Thankfully I can say that it was very well done and actually offered something totally different to what I was expecting. Yes, it gets a little far-fetched in the final act but if you go with it, The Girl on the Train really is a suspenseful watch.Coming to the performances, The Girl on the Train features a great lead performance from Emily Blunt and a solid supporting cast, Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson jumping on the paranoia train with Emily Blunt to great effect. So, if you're a fan of either mysteries or thrillers, The Girl on the Train will be a journey you want to go on. If not, best to wait at the platform for the next train.",The Girl on the Train
239,ReelLifeReviews,A very average thriller,5,12 February 2017,"An unsympathetic main character and a plodding pace didn't keep me very engaged. Emily Blunt really gives it her all, but I just couldn't get behind her character at all. It's always a shame to have such a great performance in an otherwise mediocre film. The supporting cast, however, was average at best. Seeing Lisa Kudrow in any other role is still jarring to me even after all these years removed from Friends. Obviously I have no one to blame but myself for being pulled out of the movie when she's on screen, but it still played a factor. The last 20 minutes or so of the movie were actually quite good, it's just getting there that's the problem. Probably wait for Netflix on this one.",The Girl on the Train
240,DJKwa,A Tepid Adaptation,5,29 October 2016,"There's a longstanding argument that film adaptations rarely live up to the book on which they are based on. Books allow you to inhibit the characters: to live inside their mind, to learn about their motivations and to share in their thoughts. Smartly written characters and skillful writing can elevate even the most perfunctory stories. The problem with film adaptations is that they strip away most of the novel's subtext in effort to streamline the narrative for big-screen consumption, often leaving the story raw and undercooked. Case in point is Tate Taylor's tepid adaption of Paula Hawkin's novel The Girl on the Train.The characters in this languid film adaptation never feel as intriguing as they do in the literary counterpart. They sit flatly on the screen and feel one-note, forced to communicate their thoughts and feelings through relentless close-ups of wistful glances and pained expressions. On the screen they lack the detail and depth in which they held on the page, with Emily Blunt's tragic, drunk protagonist coming off as particularly facile. Watching her downward spiral is wearisome and, worse still, she comes off as self-absorbed and unlikeable, which buries most of the film's tension. What is left is a limp story that relies too dearly on flashy filmmaking in the form of cut-aways, flashbacks and multiple points of views, to capture audience attention. All that it's really trying to do is cover up an inert narrative, that is likely to puzzle those who haven't read the book as to what all the fuss was about to begin with. If there is one silver lining, it's that Blunt delivers a fully committed performance that almost makes the film worth seeing on her merits alone. She doesn't shy away from the ugliness of her character and elevates otherwise dreary material with a performance that would have been considered as Oscar-worthy had the film turned out better.Conclusion: There is a certain pleasure in seeing the characters you have spent time with in your mind jumping out to life in front of you but this is soon usurped by the realisation that ultimately the film offers very little that wasn't already in the book and done far better. Those who have already taken the ride before in paperback will find little to get on board with on this train.",The Girl on the Train
241,terrellrobinson71,A terrific psychological thriller of secrets and voyeurism with a fearless performance by Emily Blunt,8,8 October 2016,"Rachel Watson is a down-on-her-luck British woman living in New York who is a bit of a trainwreck. Her husband left her and married his mistress, she drinks and blackouts in despair and she likes to get a look by peeking through other people's life when she rides the train. This is the simple idea of ""The Girl on the Train"". Now, like millions of readers who have devoured this book, I have read the Paula Hawkins novel in which this film is based on. There have also been a lot of comparisons to ""Gone Girl"", another book/movie that also dealt with the psychology of women. ""Gone Girl"" was more superior, because it had such a wickedly humorous bite and it was ferociously masterful. This movie and the book doesn't have any of that. What the movie does have is Emily Blunt, who is giving such a fearless performance as that girl who sees almost everything through that train that she, along with some terrific acting from a splendid cast, beautiful but bleak cinematography and a haunting score courtesy of the great Danny Elfman, makes the movie work a lot more than the book would. (More on that in a moment.) Anyway, after one drunk night, Rachel (Blunt) wakes up to find herself an unreliable witness in a mystery involving a young woman, Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) who went missing in that same night. It turns out that Megan used to babysit the daughter of Rachel's ex-husband, Tom (Justin Theroux) and his new wife, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson). Giving the fact that there is some time missing from where she was at, Rachel tries to figure out what happened on that night, while trying to solve this mystery. So far, there's no one to trust. Not even Megan's husband, Scott (Luke Evans) or her therapist (Edgar Ramirez). The more reasonable one is Detective Riley (Allison Janney), who is very suspicious of Rachel. Now, I admired the book, but I couldn't connect to each of the characters, plus the twist at the end was sort of obvious. But here's how director Tate Taylor (of the wonderful ""The Help"" and the electric James Brown biopic ""Get on Up""), screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson (of ""Secretary"" and ""Chloe"") and cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen managed to do: They made the movie even better than the book, which is a rare thing. I got to be involved with the story more because these characters are flawed and we see the danger of what happens when someone starts to snap when some secrets are being spilled out in the most inopportune moment. Plus, you have Emily Blunt in your movie, which makes it work even more, even when you feel like you're being lost in the confused suburban melodrama of it all. And the twist at the end doesn't feel very obvious with a surprising additional character added into the mix. The three women are terrifically played as icy, complex and sometimes troubled women and each of their stories do connect, even if you didn't notice it. Blunt is great, Bennett gives such a stunning, breakout performance and Ferguson is subtly effective. Of the three amazing male leads of the story, the best of the three is Luke Evans, who gives a searing performance as a man who is looking for answers involving his wife and the frustration that comes out of that seems palpable. And I'm always glad to see Allison Janney in a movie and I'm happy to follow her anywhere. I'm also happy to report that if you like the book, you'll like the movie. I found it intriguing, mysterious and sometimes twisted. Even if it didn't reach ""Gone Girl"" status, that still doesn't make this a good thriller. What makes this movie a good thriller is the fact that everybody has secrets, good and bad. Some bad secrets should be forgotten, not mentioned or revealed. And sometimes, secrets, especially when you see things from the train, can get you into a world of trouble.",The Girl on the Train
242,paulmcuomo,"Read the book. No, seriously, read the book, it's so much better than this",2,6 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train is a novel that kind of jumped up on the world, especially with the unbelievable success of the book and movie versions of Gone Girl. Since then, this sub-genre of Domestic Noir has exploded and it seems that every novel that can be compared to Gone Girl has been optioned for a film: this, and Renee Knight's Disclaimer had the film rights purchased before the novels were even released to the public! It's a bandwagon that needs to stop, because I cannot understand how this movie could've been so disappointing and poor as it is.As an Englishman, the film's location shift did aggravate me a lot. It's one of those things that changes nothing but everything at the same time; the train system in London is a very different one to New York, where it's more underground based. But that's a setting thing, doesn't affect the movie as a whole. What does affect the movie is how viciously, and how insufferably BORING IT IS! Seriously, this film treats everything like its the most binal and uninteresting thing, in which all the characters talk in flat and monotone voices, and the fact that screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson has removed so much of the kinks and human error from it. Add to this is that most of the characters are completely flat, with almost no backstory - the only real ""backstories"" being had by Megan and Rachel, more of those in a second - and this makes everything SO hard to sit through, or barely care when stuff happens. Tate Taylor, who made the excellent The Help some years ago, and directed his actors in that with such confidence and zest, makes me wonder why this movie is so lifeless, and why he struggled to direct his actors in this with any human qualities to them. It's like he is trying to out-Gone Girl Gone Girl, but the problem with that is that David Fincher is clearly more adept at darker material; the way Fincher accentuates moments of extreme pivotal violence, like Amy's murder of Desi, or gives a clear indication of where/when stuff is happening, or made the only real monster of the movie Gone Girl Amy, and made the others human but just flawed in some way. Everyone here is just nasty, in some way, but in such unremarkable ways - or ways that are made to feel unremarkable, such as Rachel inserting herself into Scott Hipwell's life after his wife is murdered.OK, Rachel's backstory is quickly glossed over; she was unable to conceive, so she began her spiral into alcoholism. That's it for her, and Emily Blunt, who is at her best when portraying characters being slowly broken down by life, does her best, but as stated, there's really no humanity to Rachel, so alas is all blowing into the wind. Megan, played by Haley Bennett, is by far the most tragic character, and that is because we can see how irreparably damaged she is from the death of a baby she conceived at a young age, to the point where she ends up in the situation that gets her killed. And Anna? Yeah, she's just there, she does nothing short of providing a good ending for Rachel, but all of her vindictive attitude is removed from the book, and so Rebecca Ferguson looks completely lost and is easily the weakest of the 3 main characters. Luke Evans tries, but is stumped by the absurd amount of sex scenes him and Bennett are involved with and an absence of character beyond that. And Justin Theroux as Tom is just a nasty guy; now, in the novel he's a nasty guy, but he was a nasty guy with a past, and in this he has no past.Really, in the end, Blunt and Bennett tried. Thumbs up for that. This movie however is just jumping on the Gone Girl bandwagon, but not taking the effort or care that movie took with its material. Just...just read the book.",The Girl on the Train
243,vav-61764,The Girl on the Train Review,4,16 November 2016,"The premise of the film is captivating, a case of disappearance, nothing like a good mystery to captivate the public. The idea is already recurring, but has already given rise to well-known films such as Gone Girl by David Finch and The Suspects of Denis Villeneuve. However, The Girl on the Train does not reach the expectations for a number of problems.The editing is not the best and the film is very cut out. There are many rhythm breaks, much of this breaks is due to the use of flashbacks, these scenes are used to create a larger context for the characters, to get the audience to care more about the story and its characters, but mainly to make the public create sympathy for the victim, Megan ( Halley Bennett).Rachel played by Emily Blunt and is the best part of the film, her acting stands out from the rest of the cast. Emily Blunt's scenes bring a greater emotional weight to the film, her performance convey the total insecurity, volatility, emotional instability and all the suffering the character is going through. When Emily Blunt is on the scene, the film is one, when she is not, it becomes another and looses a lot of quality. The arcs of Anna (Rebecca Fergunson) and Anna are not so good and looked rather artificial compared to Rachel's. Each change is a rhythm break and as the others arcs are not interesting as the main one, I wanted to return as soon ass possible to Emily Blunt's character.Like any movie of this style, clues, false or not, are shown along the movie to develop the whole plot; if you pay attention, you will solve the mystery before it is even revealed. When we know the truth, there is an impressive character deconstruction, all the following scenes with this character, seem to be with another person, totally different from the one shown to us throughout the film. This break is done so abruptly, it seemed out of place and not so shocking because the whole flawed development of the plot earlier.",The Girl on the Train

246,gemandeye1,Neat mystery. Excellent multilayered characters. Great story.,8,5 March 2017,"First off, book snobs just move along. You have about the same value as the Academy Award Panel and most uppity movie critics that like the same type of movies or actors every year. There are approx. 400 (give or take) pages in a novel allowing authors to expand more on their vision. I applaud great authors. Screen writers and directors have to take their ideas cut a lot of stuff out (hence, the evolution of director's cuts of movies The also have to battle with production companies if the film goes over 2 hours, for bid 3. and We all have heard for decades ""how much better the book is than the movie"". You're opinion and it deserves to be in your book chat room not on IMDb (Internet MOVIE Data Base) on such a nauseating frequency. We get it. But most of us on here Love MOVIES. We even may read a book, too and enjoy it. But let's compare movies for their merit on film making to include acting, directing, storytelling-screenplay, production, etc. And with that being said if we only read books we wouldn't get to enjoy the artists that act, the writers that can map out a screenplay and script, a director that can set an atmosphere, ad so on. OK, so now back to the MOVIE. This was a drama with a mystery that built along. I enjoyed that as it wasn't your typical ""whodunit"" mystery from the get go but built on the why, how, and the who a it went along. The multilayered characters drawn out by actors Emily Blount, Justin Theroux, and Haylie Bennett were done in subtle, believable, and stellar fashion. The supporting cast Luke Evans (never a disappointment), Laura Prepon (stepping far away from that 70's show), Edgar Ramirez ( a stellar actor in his own right with each role he plays), and Rebecca Ferguson all do a fantastic job. The story, which some considered slow, I believe was purposefully paced to build to a climactic ending. This did not appear to ever be intended to be a fast paced action thriller by any means. The pace worked great with the atmosphere built. Unless you read the BOOK or someone told you it's pretty difficult to figure everything out before the end, and I usually guess most by the mid-point aggravating my family and friends. This was different and refreshing. The mystery truly unfolds like a good page turner (for any of you book snobs still reading this). If you are in the mood for a toned-down pace of a mystery thriller with a lot of little things to look and listen for along with great acting watch this one on that day. If you want high action or horror (which is actually my favorite genre) this isn't for you today. And if you want to read a BOOK by all means do so.

250,StorieLuver,How one person's selfishness can destroy multiple lives,10,21 January 2018,"By titling the book and movie ""The GIRL on the Train"" and making Rachel the narrator/protagonist, the audience is fooled into thinking this is Rachel's story, when really it isn't. This is TOM's story, and how his selfishness and single-minded pursuit of his own wants and desires ruins other people's lives. So here's a summary of the story, when you retell it from Tom's perspective:
Tom wants the stereotypical perfect suburban life with the stay-at-home wife and 2.5 kids. He marries Rachel, but it turns out she can't give him children. So rather than adopt (because they wouldn't be ""his"" children, which I believe the book did point out), Tom starts cheating on Rachel and lets her become a raging alcoholic. Tom divorces Rachel, leaving her life a total shambles, and moves on to marry Anna, who promptly produces the baby he wants. When Anna then starts to focus on the baby rather than Tom, he starts ANOTHER affair with Megan (because of course, it's still all about Tom and what he wants). Unfortunately for Megan, who doesn't want children because of a trauma in her past, she becomes pregnant with Tom's child. Well, Tom can't have a pregnant mistress ruining his ""happy"" marriage with Anna, so he murders the inconvenient mistress. And that, in a nutshell, is the real plot line of this story. So what is the role of the girl on the train, other than to be the discarded, barren first wife who turns to alcoholism to deal with the loss of her husband and home? In an act of karma, she gets to witness (from her train) a piece of evidence which draws her into Megan's disappearance/murder and ultimately bring Tom to the justice he so richly deserves.",The Girl on the Train

As a character study on a very ""sad girl"" this definitely works, as a thriller/mystery it certainly does as well. What fails is the direction of the film, especially towards the end.There are some loose ends that don't quite connect or are left hanging.

261,BlueFairyBlog,Disgruntled Passenger,4,31 October 2016,"Paula Hawkins' 2015 novel ""The Girl on the Train,"" wasn't a revelation, but was much needed after the immense popularity of ""Gone Girl."" Personally I read through it very quickly and found its twists and turns to be exactly what was needed to make for a good, enthralling thriller. The best aspect of the book was the unreliability of the narrator, (Rachel) who was a divorcée alcoholic with a penchant for misery and self-deprecation. Her blackouts serve as a great cloaking device for the mystery, and enable us the audience to suspect almost everyone, including Rachel (Blunt). Though the film tried its darndest to be ""Gone Girl,"" alas it didn't capture the assured grim reality of being an unstable woman, or the darkness of the crime that drives the plot.The reason I am being so harsh isn't just because this film isn't ""Gone Girl,"" but because it veers away from the book in all the wrong ways. It changes Rachel from a complete mess of a human being into a slightly flawed neurotic; it rushes through its plot, casts a Venezuelan actor to play an Indian psychiatrist, and tries to play up its red herrings to its own detriment. While the twist in the book took its time to generate tension and disbelief in its villain, the film gives it away too soon and creates a strange ending in the process. So much of what made the book great lay in its darkness and sense of plot, and this film jumbles itself to try and keep us guessing to ill effect. The ending was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film because it makes little sense and loses all its tension so that it can feature an unneeded flashback. This in turn makes the ending nonsensical, and it's unclear just how Anna is handling the situation internally.Maybe the ending's issues lies in the miscasting of this entire film, because everyone involved feels wrong. Justin Theroux is too severe in his role as Tom, just as Jack Nicholson was already too frightening to be a convincing father in ""The Shining."" Rebecca Ferguson, who I so loved in ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation,"" plays the exact opposite of Ilsa: a pathetic underling of her husband's whims, who can't think for herself. Finally Haley Bennett was absolutely the worst choice to play a successful, wise gallery owner as she appears far too young. That and her character is simplified down to a sex addict with strange, awkward emotions that make her appear more crazy than interesting. No one seems to want to be in this movie except Emily Blunt, who is perfectly cast but isn't given enough on screen to really zing as Rachel. All in all this film is flawed beyond repair, and needed a director willing to take chances, and a script that actually thrilled.",The Girl on the Train
262,expe67,very good thriller,8,1 January 2017,"i really liked this movie.i thought it was strong,intense and i totally bought the whole plot.OK maybe if you'd think for a little bit you could understand who the bad guy was,there were not many too many characters to begin with.but the surprise and turning point of the facts altered to me where a surprise.i told you i bought the plot.i am not cynical but i have a long experience in watching movies.for instance i thought jack reacher 2 was a very mediocre predictable movie.also,i don't like movies that tend to show only one side of people.for instance,all women are victims and all men are bad.as this movie is attacked by many to be.but i don't agree.first of all there was a guy who saved her.and the woman lieutenant was a moron.but i think i was grabbed from the very first minute from ms. Blunt's extraordinary performance.maybe that movie was intended to be your typical feminist thriller.but the level of acting from everyone was above average.i am surprise that some people were put off from the fact that blunt was nominated for a screen actors award.i see she is not nominated for a golden globe.that's a shame.it is a long time i have seen such a fragile performance.BRAVO TO HER !!!! also the direction was very good ,with close ups to make you feel the tension ,the fear,and be uncomfortable for the character's problems.i don't know guys ,i think this movie is a winner.it did not get very good review.i just disagree.i strongly recommend it.if only for ms. Blunt's but also ms. Bennett's special performance.",The Girl on the Train
263,Anaslair,Emily Blunt is truly amazing,7,26 February 2017,"Not having read the book, I arrived at the theatre with a fully open mind.For the most part I enjoyed the movie, although I felt the pace was very slow – particularly in the first half or so. I wanted more tension, to feel more suspense. However, at the same time I feel that the pace and general mood of the movie translated Rachel's frame of mind.I did feel at times that something was missing in the narrative; I wanted certain things explained or differently developed, as they did not make much sense. But overall I kept wanting to know how things played out for these three women, and how their lives interconnected, not to mention what really happened that night. When that is finally revealed I was completely taken by surprise. I had not seen it coming at all.I would like to stress out Emily Blunt's stellar performance with such a multidimensional character. Everyone else also did pretty well – Haley Bennet in particular surprised me – but Blunt's range blew me away.I wonder how something like this could be put together in a book, particularly the flashbacks. I can imagine it getting quite confusing because the narrative jumps back and forth both in time and between characters. I think all that was very well handled in the movie and provided a clear narrative with little clues hidden here and there, though not nearly enough to guess how it all ended up.I will definitely be putting this book on my to-read list in a few months or year, when I have forgotten most of what I watched. As it is, the movie was quite enjoyable and I recommend it.",The Girl on the Train

I am easily disappointed by hyped up films, but fortunately I hadn't read up or heard any detail so everything was brand new.There were some very good performances but Emily Blunt was amazing. The twists and turns were great and maybe I am naive but I didn't see them all coming. I do love a psychological thriller and the vulnerable and rather normal characters reacted well to the way the plot moved on.

It was a great looking film with a very talented director and cast, especially Emily Blunt gives an Oscar worthy performance making you feel the emotions of the main character something that is quite important for this particular movie. The script introduces the three main characters and wraps up quite nicely giving the audience a very good viewing experience and making it easier for everyone to follow the plot.

267,filmsbyq,Acting Masterclass - How To Be Drunk,7,16 October 2016,"Besides Hollywood's penchant for remakes, another popular source of stories for the screen are best selling novels. The Lord Of The Rings series, The Godfather, Gone Girl, The Firm, Edge Of Tomorrow, these are all films inspired by or adapted from books. Popular books or stories translated to film has always been a well mined seam, with many pulp fiction and western books having been used thus in the forties and fifties and even before that. A film I recently saw is adapted from the best selling book of the same name; The Girl On The Train. Emily Blunt finds herself in another high profile film based on a book. The first was the Tom Cruise starrer Edge Of Tomorrow, based on the book All You Need Is Kill, it is a brilliant, alien invasion meets groundhog, day action film, that sees her play a tough as nails soldier called Rita, who is humanities best hope for survival. Blunt's star has been slowly rising over the last few years, after she was brought to global attention by her turn in 2006's The Devil Wears Prada. Though she kept working, it was not until 2011's The Adjustment Bureau that she was once again prominent in film. 2012's Looper brought another prominent role, before the aforementioned Edge Of Tomorrow. Blunt was, - not so - suddenly a leading lady. She was the lead in 2015's critically acclaimed Sicario and headlines The Girl On TheTrain. And how she headlines! The world is not fair and as much as modern society try to make it so, with calls for equality when it comes to age, race or sex, the norm is still thirty to forty-ish, white males taking the lead in most major studio films, with even older more established stars likely to get a film green-lit than a studio 'risking' money on a young up and comer. Women headlining serious fare is even more rare. Thirty-something women headlining a major film is almost unheard of. By studio standards, even with the massive promotion, Emily Blunt opening a film was a risk. Admittedly with the likes of Jennifer Lawerence, Shailene Woodley and belatedly, Daisy Ridley, it might seem as though the time of male stars opening major films is past, but those three actors, all in their twenties, are targeted at a youthful demographic, that hard to attract 18-25 group. Blunt is in a very much aimed at adults film and she leads it brilliantly. She plays Rachel, a divorcée whose life is spiralling out of control. This not not helped by her alcoholism, or her obsession with a woman she sees in a house that she passes on her daily commute. It turns out that not only does her daily commute take her pass her old home, where her ex husband lives with his new wife and child, but it is also an unnecessary one, having lost her job a year earlier due to her excessive drinking. Rachel's obsession, combined with her drinking which on occasion causes blackouts, make it difficult for her to be taken seriously when the woman of her obsession, Megan, disappears. In her misguided attempts to help the investigation, Rachel makes herself the most likely suspect. Unable to recall what exactly happened, when in a drunken stupor she tried to confront Megan on the night of her disappearance, she finds herself increasingly distressed as she tries to piece together the elements of her life and that night. Not since Michael Caine has anybody given such a wholly convincing performance as a drunk as the one Blunt gives in this film. She is ruddy faced - make up - glassy eyed, belligerent and vulnerable and unsure and self destructive. It is such a complete performance, it hard to believe she was not actually drunk doing it! She is touching and pathetic, not quite at the level of drinking in shop doorways but oh so close. Blunt is mesmerising in this film. In a film with several strong female characters, with Helen Bennett; recently of the Magnificent Seven remake, Rebecca Ferguson; who glowed in the last Mission Impossible film and the ever reliable Allison Janney, all the actors give great performances. The men - with the exception of Edgar Ramirez as Dr. Kamal - are slightly under written. In the case of Justin Theroux's ex husband, Tom, story mechanics made that a necessity. Luke Evans, who plays Scott, Megan's husband, is given the weakest material to work with, which is a shame because he has a great animalistic presence on screen that could have been utilised more. I found The Girl On The Train to be very enjoyable and entertaining. Emily Blunt's performance alone is reason enough to go and see the film.",The Girl on the Train

270,shevaunhodge,"Oh, hello Phoebe Buffay!!",9,15 March 2019,"Ok, so this film is good, but when you have read the book and then watch the film, the shock factor that the book gave you is gone. I still enjoyed this film even though I knew what the outcome of the film was. People criticised this film, and I believe this is because you can never truly match the experience you have when reading a brilliant book like girl on the train with watching a film based around the book. Reading stimulates the creative mind, so each person creates their own ""film"" when reading, in a way. People slated it because the characters didn't look like what they expected and where the film was based was different to how they saw it etc. Well everyone has a different imagination don't they.? I'm sure Paula Hawkins wasn't prepared for the media coverage she got let alone the book being created into a movie. However, I do agree with the opinion that it was a shame that the film was filmed in America because the book is based in London. However, I do question if they would be able to film in London because of the trains etc being so busy? It was a bit weird that the Rachel was British and the rest of the actors were American. I also kind of agree with the views that Emily blunt is too pretty to play Rachel, yes she is too pretty because Rachel is supposed to be a fat alcoholic, but then again, could anyone pull off the role as Rachel as good as Emily blunt ? Probably not. Her acting as a drunk person is so good she almost looks like she is possessed at certain points in the film ha! Oh and the title of the review is there because that's what I said to mylself, obviously in my head, whilst in the cinema, when I saw Lisa kudrow. I wasn't told she was in it, she only has a small part, but I think it is a crucial part of the film. It was nice to see that she is a diverse actress, and can take on a role of a completely different character. The book is overall better, but the film is good, also.",The Girl on the Train

She also becomes infatuated with the couple who live a few houses down. She thinks their life must be perfect and is happy for them until one day she sees (or thinks she sees?) something horrifying happen there, blacks out and wakes up badly beaten with no memory of what happened to her.

Has a twist in the end, which I personally did not expect, but that is all. 90 percent of the movie is just an alcoholic trying to piece together out-of-order events through a drunken haze.Overall, very Nordic in its presentation, but lacked some sort of zinc that would make it interesting for long.",The Girl on the Train
274,sukanya-samy,Blah,6,28 October 2016,"The girl on the train had so much build up that I decided to see it. Having read the book only a couple of months ago, the story was fresh in my mind. First reviewed on 'broth of blogs'. So here goes:Plot and ScriptThis is a story of three women, deeply flawed – whose lives get entangled without them wanting to. For those who don't the plot, I won't ruin it for you but Emily Blunt (Rachel) is a divorcée whose ex-husband Justin Theroux (Tom) is married to Rebecca Ferguson (Anna) and have a baby. Tom cheated on Rachel and she took to alcohol to get over the depression of not being able to have a baby.The present – Rachel takes the train to NY every day though she was fired from her job just to feel normal and has been seeing this perfect couple from the train every day who seem to be very much in love – Luke Evans (Scott) and Haley Bennett (Megan) and longs to be in their place, in a life where she is loved and has a real family.One day Rachel sees Megan kiss another man from the train and things go out of control there on. Its a missing person mystery which then becomes a murder mystery.Okay I have to admit it. I didn't like the book that much. It was interesting but it wasn't super interesting and it definitely was not worth the hype. So I didn't go in with too many expectations. The plot in the movie is more confusing than the book. The back and forth that Paula Hawkins has in her book has been reduced quite a bit but the turn of events is still not very seamless in the movie. Also, a lot has been missed out that is explained well in the movie like where does Rachel get the money for alcohol, the shame she feels every time she drinks, her relationship with her roommate Cathy – they all add to the narrative which the movie fails to do.Characterization and Acting (C&A)The acting to me seemed a little superficial from everyone. See, the book is tragic and it is able to establish that through emotions, thoughts, background stories which the movie was not able to show at all. Emily Blunt tries her best to show everything that her character Rachel feels – the shame, the guilt, the helplessness, the pity but how many such emotions can one actor play? I give her full points to try. The others are all very mediocre with not much character build up at all.Sounds and Effects (S&E)The music by Danny Elfman was probably the best part of the movie for me. It was quiet and suspenseful which is what you want in a thriller. It reminded me of Gone Girl and a lot of people are comparing this movie to Gone Girl, but that was a far superior thriller from all aspects.Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)The visuals and cinematography were good to a large extent. Again with the time periods it does look a little like Gone Girl but there is no comparison really.Direction and Overall (D &O)Overall, I didn't quite like the movie. I mean its definitely not a Gone Girl – there are problems in the screenplay and a book which is mostly about what one woman is thinking, it is difficult to bring out in movies. Superficial is the word.So here are my scores:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1Characterization and Acting (C&A) – 1Sounds and Effects (S&E) – 1.5Cinematography and Visuals (C&V) – 1.5Direction and Overall (D &O) – 1Overall Score – 6 out of 10If you are really looking forward to this movie, my guess is that you will come out disappointed. For people who don't care for the book/movie, wait for the DVD. Another failure of a book being adapted on to the big screen.First reviewed on broth of blogs on wordpress",The Girl on the Train
275,FrostyChud,Feminist Propaganda,6,4 November 2016,"TGOTT is two films in one. The first is a ruthless, unflinching portrait of the female unconscious. For the first half of the movie, the most politically incorrect (and universal) feminine fantasies are presented to us: being married, being beaten, being bad, possessing a baby...but above all, being unsatisfied. After the first half hour, I was ready to give Paula Hawkins a medal for breaking the feminist omerta and showing us how dark it can get in there. By the time a drunk Emily Blunt smashed a mirror with a golf club, I began to wonder when the other shoe was going to drop. We are simply not allowed today to think that women are capable of evil. The unofficial censors would never let such a truthful portrayal of feminine indigence, jealousy, and rage to appear on the screen without brushing it under the rug through some clever legerdemain. I was right. A handy-dandy scapegoat is soon trotted out to take the fall. Of the three main female characters, two experience themselves as lacking, whereas the third, Anna, experiences herself as full. Why? Because she has a baby. The other two want that baby. They want it bad. Freud is clear here: in the female unconscious, the baby is the ultimate phallus substitute. No one cares about life, or the world, or politics, or the economy, or music, or philosophy, or anything else...all they care about is that damn baby. The three male characters are all figments of the female imagination. One is the nice guy (the therapist), one is the fiery fantasy lover from romance novels (Scott), and one is the ""real man"" (Tom), which is to say, a frigid woman's fantasy of what a man is: a heartless player whose only pleasure in life lies in humiliating women. TGOTT is a regressive, chilling female fantasy. Rather than facing their own inner emptiness, the three women in this film prefer to project it onto a man who has the nerve to possess a phallus. The terrible thing is that penis envy does not have to be the horizon of feminine sexuality. Read Maria Torok. Where I live, in Paris, it is still occasionally possible to meet courageous women who do not accept the life-negating ethics of revenge and reparation trumpeted by today's triumphant feminism and personified by Hillary Clinton. None of the women in this movie actually like sex. All they care about are babies. How depressing. No wonder Tom is so frustrated. He cannot find a woman who is not frigid. Welcome to 21st century America, Tom. Something awful happens to a woman when she begins to need a baby. She dies to the world of desire. Life contracts to a single, sterile point. Unfortunately, in our puritanical society, the dark side of maternity is something that we are not prepared to see. Paula Hawkins glimpses it, but she doesn't have the balls to take it to its logical conclusion. TGOTT is a dangerous film for women. Rachel was in a position to learn something about herself at the beginning of the movie. The path to the truth always lies through a traversal of one's constitutive abjection. I liked the alcoholic Rachel. Drinking too much and not working are reasonable, authentic responses to the awful world we live in today. But Rachel is too attached to conformity and narcissism to pursue her psychoanalysis to its term. The film must be read as a series of dreams produced by a patient undergoing analysis. The only ""true"" scenes in the movie are the scenes with Rachel and the therapist. Everything else is a distortion. The three characters are three aspects of her unconscious. When she begins to come too close to the ugly and dangerous fantasies that haunt her and make her ill (she is mutilated, empty, barren, castrated, humiliated, abject, a stain), she cooks up a pathetic fairy tale about an evil ex-husband whose dark penis is responsible for the suffering of not one but three separate plucky women. The deus ex machina Tom absolves her of taking any responsibility for her own alcoholic suffering. A competent psychoanalyst would know how to liquidate this convenient screen-fantasy and shepherd Rachel to a more authentic relationship with her own unconscious. But Kamal is not a competent analyst. He privileges her neurotic desire for revenge (killing the husband by penetrating him with her imaginary phallus, now transformed into a corkscrew) over a traversal of her penis envy, which alone might lead her to the discovery that the essence of femininity is not lack and emptiness so great it can only be filled with a baby, but rather a plenitude that is not endangered by the existence of masculine desire. But that isn't what happens. We live in a world in which we are constantly thrown back on our most regressive fantasies. After all, a society of emotionally mutilated men and women for whom sex and love are mercantile transactions grounded in lack and resentment is a society of perfect consumers. By the end of the movie, Rachel is cleaned up and ready to go back to her soulless corporate job in Public Relations, which is to say, as a propagandist for a corrupt capitalist order. In other words, she becomes Paula Hawkins.",The Girl on the Train

I'm not a huge fan of skipping about in the time frame to create drama - it seems like cheating - but it's all the rage now. Anyway, the conclusion was pretty gripping. Crime aficionados will probably guess whodunnit before the end but that doesn't spoil the fun.

277,tvsweeney-39052,Basically Tiring,7,13 April 2017,"I hope the novel moved faster than the movie. The plot was a good one and the ending a twist with plenty of characters to consider as the ""villain"" until the real one is revealed, but it was so S*L*O*W*. In places, the continuity seemed as wobbly as Rachel's drunken gait, and I got so very tired of seeing close-ups of her wide-eyed, stricken face. Eventually, I simply found myself wondering when the whole thing would be over.The plot: Rachel (no ""girl"" by any means), on a train commute fantasizes about a couple she sees everyday as she passes her old neighborhood, with memories of her broken marriage mixed in. The couple seem very much in love so when she see the wife on her balcony appearing to kiss another man, she feels it's her duty to tell the husband. Shortly afterward, the wife goes missing and Rachel tries to discover what actually happened as she struggles to piece together her memory of that night as well as other fragments of her life.There are plenty of questions left unanswered in this story, mainly: If Rachel lost her job a year before, how can she afford to buy all those train tickets, much less anything else? The acting is good by all, and the twists and turns unexpected, with one character after another being set up in Rachel's faulty memory as the murderer. Everyone seems transitory, however, being merely popping in to become more factors in her confusion.If there had been some way to speed up the action a bit, this movie would've be, while not enjoyable, at least entertaining. I watched this movie from a DVD but I don't think seeing it on the big screen would've made a difference. As it was, my initial reply, when asked about it, is: ""Tiring.""",The Girl on the Train

One is a pathetic alcoholic, while the other two are willing adulteresses, who only mind it when the man is cheating on them too, while enjoying his favours when they are cheating his first wife, the poor alcoholic.

I expected more twists in the climax only to find out that the climax was not that complicated compared to the previous events. The movie is also a classical portrayal of conflicts between couples who don't get along or couples who engage into a proselytizing act by convincing their partner that they are ones to be blamed. The movie also depicts the role a place, time, and fractions of moments how hurtful it can be especially for people who commute on a daily basis. Here I was asking myself whether her alcohol was commuting or the beverage itself. In our present civilization, much of our working hours are spent in routine tasks that turn us into walking machines and even create alternate realities that we plunge into when commuting.

Truly stunning.Haley Bennett and Rebecca Furguson really made a stronger name for themselves. This film is dark...very dark. They performed in such a way that gave respect to the many women that, no doubt, have found themselves in similar situations. Their roles were taken very seriously, as they had little wiggle room given how easily it would be to call out poor acting in a film like this.I also need to make mention to Justin Theroux. He and Emily Blunt play the most complicated characters in the film. Justin's character builds so well until the very end, where his character shines in such a way that roots the viewer on the edge of their seat.As far as filmography, it is generally filmed from the perspective of Rachel, Emily Blunt's character. Therefore, the film can feel either too dizzy, too still, or too sporadic at different times, given the situation and the state of Rachel. It is designed to get you into Rachel's mind, with very little narration from any other source.Keep yourself away from the spoilers and let this movie take you on a ride.

285,jmgimbel,It's hard to care,3,12 February 2019,"I love thrillers but Emily Blunt painfully over-acts and is all over the place here, which matches the script that jumps around constantly. There's not enough backstory to care about her sadness, the only character who's not over-acting and is at least partly formed character is the always fabulous Haley Bennet (Meghan).
What could've been a fun thriller with a better script is just not fun or fascinating.",The Girl on the Train
286,xoxo411,Story of 2 Women with Complications of PTSD,8,7 October 2016,"Saw the movie before today's official release but have thought about it a lot even after the movie was over but it did not appear in my dreams. It had an impact on me so it is a good movie for me,so my rating is 8. Many view the movie with the perspective of solving a complicated mystery but my belief is that, the Director or the Story Writer probable had been through personal experiences of Trauma,or have a close family member or members or friends who have been through Trauma of life or even more. A good movie with superb acting across the board. From the perpetrator, to the victim, to the healer they have all played a tremendous skillful role. All scene were ambiguous,leaving for the viewer to imaging right versus wrong, truth versus deceit, and many more thoughts from the beginning to the end. I was surprised to see many young people who made up the majority of the audience that night on the edge of their seats. I am wondering if there were many more in our society with such hidden experiences or mainly because they needed further learning curve, due to recent ravages of war elsewhere and terror within thus making them eager to learn more. The movie brings about the core OTHER SYMPTOMS of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which is often not reported or volunteered.The most important symptoms are loss of parts of memories that are so important and the subtle but long standing emotional abuse that could lead to major trauma and self destructive life style. The healer in this case is a classic,ethical, concerned, apathetic psychiatrist who distinctly knew his boundary between him and his highly vulnerable patient and yet he was very professionally intimate without violating his professional standards of medical practice.A fine piece of art and also an evening of serious entertainment and knowledge base.",The Girl on the Train

290,gricey_sandgrounder,Good premise. But manages to derail itself.,6,5 October 2016,"The buzz for this has been growing for quite some time now. Especially when we only seem to get a handful of mystery thrillers. It is a genre that we rarely see. But when they are good, they are awards worthy.While expecting something similar to Gone Girl with a Hitchcockian feel to it. I partly got that. But instead of Hitchcock, I got more Requiem For A Dream. While those two films are extremely good, The Girl On The Train is a badly structured version of these two films.The opening scene sets you in nicely. But after that, we got a whole lot of time jumps all over its time-line that reminded me much of Oliver Stone's 'Alexander', which I had problems with. For most of the film, I was busy concentrating to see if we had gone a few months or if we were back to the present day. Thankfully, I was still understanding what was happening the final act was at least its strongest and least confusing part of the film.I really like Emily Blunt. I saw her as a pretty solid period actor. Then suddenly, her bad-ass role in Edge Of Tomorrow made me see her differently in such a positive way that has made me excited for anything she does. Even the sequel to Mary Poppins in 2018. Sadly for this one, she felt mis-cast for me. While she was most definitely giving it her all. I just felt her face did not match with the character and the general feel of the film. Plus, her character was really hard to root for. I had pretty much the same feeling with most of the rest of the cast. Luke Evans felt wasted and the role should have been given to someone else less well known. I think he maybe should have switched places with Justin Theroux's character. Edgar Ramirez was o.k. But his character did not have moments to really shine. The only performances worth putting into the positive light were Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson. Bennett was probably the only true performance and she definitely fitted in nicely to the story and tone. As for Ferguson, I had only known it was her when looking through the cast list after seeing the film. She was pretty unrecognisable, and the blond hair made even harder. After her impressive performance in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, I am always excited to what she will do next. In this one, she was good enough for me to be interested by her character.The main positives from this was certainly the cinematography and the Danny Elfman score. I liked the colour palette it was going for. It was very David Fincher. That grimy set of colours definitely put in the mystery thriller genre straight away.Sadly, there is not much good stuff left to talk about. The structure is the films real let-down. There is a solid mystery thriller in here. But its jumping from one moment to the next in random pockets gives you time to work out where you are rather than on the story which also never gains pace or as much tension as you would hope.While director Tate Taylor has directed some good films such as The Help and Get On Up, this one is a real disappointment. You will most of your time feeling drunk wondering where you are, then trying to enjoy this movie. I can definitely see at a point why it does make you feel drunk. But I don't think it should done to the extent of being frustrated with the film. There is enough good parts for this to not be a total disaster, and at least it has a satisfying final act. But it is a real shame that this manage to derail (don't usually do puns, but I couldn't resist) itself.",The Girl on the Train

This thriller is atmospheric and suspenseful, like the best-selling Paula Hawkins novel it's based on. Emily carries the weight of Rachel's alcohol dependency, an awful cocktail mixed with grief and self-hatred. Its heroes and villains are painted with a one-dimensional brush, either evil and angry, icy, or simply a big hot mess.It almost feels like a lot of The Girl on the Train's potential was left on the cutting room floor, taken out for brevity or simplicity. But characters like these deserve complex treatment. And audiences need more than just the twist in the end if you want to leave them puzzling over a movie after the credits roll.

297,tedd0093,"Drawn out, but worth it",6,27 February 2018,"I haven't read the book, but i can tell that this thriller needs a bit more runtime. From the opening scene, to the flashbacks, there seems to be some plot points missing (maybe in the editing-chair). That's noticeable around the characters introduced in the end, such as the caterer at Tom's birthday and such. This is a shame because it wouldn't need more than a few minutes of screen-time in the early hour of the film, but ends up being a cheap way to tie up loose ends. Maybe it worked on paper, but is lacking on the emotional storytelling displayed on the big screen.With that said.... the film is still a really pleasant viewing. The characters are well written and acted. Especially Emily Blunt - who delivers a performance as a drunk, confused and distrusted woman caught up in a mysterious crime. The plot is well structured to leave the viewers surprised and captivated up until the end, even though it lacks in disposition. The interesting actors and emotional performances - makes up for most of the errors in the directing. The movie is not perfect, but also far from being bad.",The Girl on the Train

Slight trepidation as the trailer had shown Emily Blunt playing Rachel she looks nothing like the description by the author (I was expecting an overweight, pasty faced, lank haired woman - this is a woman who is depressed, drinks and doesn't look after herself). Emily was nothing like that. Also just as the opening scenes were shown I realised they'd replaced the London setting with somewhere in the U.S.! (WHY??) Initial disappointment. Then the characters were introduced at such a speed I was glad I'd read the book (others who hadn't read it said they found the beginning pretty confusing).I thought the film was good, but nowhere as good as the book, but that's usually the case. The time watching it sped by, always the sign of a good film. Thought the sex scenes unnecessary, and had to look away at the violent scenes.

It's hard not to give away any spoiler about what is going on so I will keep this very short.
The butler did it!
I kid, I kid.
The movie is about a woman who is not at the best time of her life, who notices something outside the train she is riding. From then on it goes on a roller-coaster (sorry) of emotions and information for the viewer. It manages to keep you on your toes about what is going on and doesn't let go till the end as with all good thrillers.

301,basildave,Falls short of a really emotionally powerful movie,7,17 April 2018,"So let's just get this out of the way, the two stand outs in this movie are Emily Blunt and Allison Janey, whose characters are so deep that I found myself wanting to know them. I wanted to talk to Rachel, and try to walk her through her rough patches and I wanted to have a drink with Detective Riley and talk about her uncanny insights into human nature... or is that vice versa?That said, when the movie would take you down one of these emotional paths, it would then switch directions because it was obvious to me that the director was trying to break you away from following obvious logical conclusions...that Tom was an abusive husband or that Rachel was actually a recovered alcoholic. I understand why Fincher used this technique (first off, it's his thing anyway, not to go in a linear temporal direction) as it did serve to reveal just enough to take you to the next level. This worked in the storyline but I feel like it cut my emotional ties to the characters. You don't really like some of the other characters until the last 20 minutes of the movie.At the end of the day you've got a one-dimensional (dead) psychotic ex-husband and a couple of emotionally tortured women he left in his wake. This film almost becomes a ""first world problems"" type of movie instead of a statement about addiction and emotional abuse... the Housewives of Westchester County and their indiscretions.Just as an aside, I used to occasionally take the Hudson line and I've known many of the places in this movie from commutes into NYC so there was kind of an appealing nostalgia to it on a personal level.",The Girl on the Train
302,AIANDAS,Why I hate Men,1,10 October 2016,"At first I thought this going to be something different. Shrouded in mystery and so on but boy was I wrong. In the immortal words of John Belushi: ""But noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"" When I think of this movie I think about what Chris Rock said at the Oscars this year about our ""friends"" in Hollywood: ""These are nice people, you know liberals.""Ended seeing this @ a screening at the DGA in NYC. Catching the 1PM showing figured would not be packed house. Sure enough it was. Anyway the best way to describe this is that it is a hate-athon and an indictment against all men. Oddly enough even the book seems to say so. The ex- husband is a murderer and a nymphomaniac but we never find out why he is so dysfunctional except that he seems to be a misogynist; then another male cast member who plays the boyfriend commits the cardinal sin in that he wants to have a family while his resident Jezebel GF is derisive and makes comments like: ""Ardlsey-on-the- Hudson is a baby factory."" At that moment the misanthropic by and large audience @ DGA snickered and laughed in a sinister fashion. Then another male character is a psychiatrist who at best pretends to observe the patient doctor relationship but oversteps his boundaries.The most sinister part of this trash is when Emily Blunt stabs her ex- husband with a corkscrew only for his current wife to screw it in deeper. At that moment this liberal audience laughed in a sinister fashion yet again.So much for Hollywood pretending it wants to heal the rifts whether it is a religious; gender based or whatever. When in doubt Hollywood will always indict and crucify men in perpetuity. Another thing that I found bizarre was that production ISO finding someone from the background artists to work with Emily they picked the 1st AD when the 2-women blared out an F-bomb against Anna Boyd. All in all an extreme disappointment that this kind of garbage of political correctness fascism still gets shoved down our throats in spite of a stellar cast this is something that should be just incinerated.",The Girl on the Train
303,geraldohanna,'The Girl on the Train' - A shocking exploit.,5,16 October 2016,"It's been two years now since David Fincher and Gillian Flynn gave us ""Gone Girl"" - An unconventional; lured and surprisingly entertaining thriller - Based on the best-selling novel. The hopes were probably raised a bit too high with The Girl on the Train - A new thriller by Tate Taylor (Get on Up ), written by Erin Cressida Wilson (Men, Women & Children) based also on the best-selling novel of the same name by Paula Hawkins.Rachael (Emily Blunt) is an alcoholic with depression who divorced her husband Tom (Justin Theroux), after catching him cheating on her with their real estate agent, a beautiful blonde named Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) whom he later marries and moves into the home Rachael decorated.Free-Fall two years later and Rachael now spends her days commuting on a train; where she often stalks Tom, Anna, and their new-born daughter Evie. During her trips, Rachael becomes fascinated with Tom's neighbors, Scott (Luke Evans) and Megan (Haley Bennett), a young couple Rachael believes to have the perfect marriage. A marriage she tries to live vicariously.Also - Megan coincidentally happens to be Evie's nanny. Another one of the films McGuffins.In reality, what Rachael believes to be a perfect marriage is not - Scott is aggressive and controlling, while Megan is detached and unfaithful, maintaining affairs between numerous men, including her psychiatrist, Dr. Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez).Director Tate Taylor tries to break new territory with this yawn of a movie but often fails with lurid cinematography and slow-paced editing that feels as if he watched Marc Foster's ""Stay"" a thousand times. Perhaps this was a movie out of his depth - given his recent credentials - ""Pretty Ugly People"", and ""The Help""; this feels like a miscast.Emily Blunt gives a fine performance while maintaining a balance of emotional insecurity and fear. Blunt being the titled star is virtually given more to do than her female counterparts. Frequent collaborator Allison Janney shows up when needed, but leaves us yearning for more of her disbelief of Blunt. Rebecca Ferguson coming strong off of ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" is given little to do or say - as the clichéd housewife.Justin Theroux, Luke Evans and Édgar Ramírez are all fine actors; and yet they themselves play unvaried and overstated characters.Screenwriter - Erin Cressida Wilson never gives us a moment to fully embrace or regard how or what these characters are feeling - Wilson writes them as if they were palpable to us - Providing us with a purposeful unstructured narrative - Flashing back to different times within each character's arc - This never becomes hard to follow or comprehend, as the film feels like a novel itself cutting between Rachael, Anna, and Megan's point of view - Providing us with enough information pertaining to the plot - We never fully care or feel anything, even after the inciting incident occurs. Ludicrous plot plots begin to kick in - As Rachael tries to find worth in her life by solving Megan's case on her own - Involving a scene where she visits Megan's psychiatrist.The Girl on the Train tries to heavily to be original and shock you with its too many twists and turns; and unreliable red herrings. But by the time we reach the dramatic reveal - We either care or don't for the resolution - Which in the end leaves us asking more questions - And wondering is this 112-minute movie should be featured as a Lifetime movie instead.",The Girl on the Train

Now I didn't read any review since I thought the premise seemed interesting.I really enjoyed the movie it is good acting and it has a mystic feel to it. The twist is food for thought, and the story is excellent. The acting in the lead roles is good and I liked all the actors even though they may not stand out as excellent. If this wasn't based on a book I think the rating would be higher. There's a lot of ""read the book its really good, this isn't"". There seems to be a combination of really liking the book and not thinking this movie represent the book in a good way. This is always a problem with a book, Interview with a vampire and gone girl for example a lot of people who read the books didn't like the movies. For me personally I have more problems with TV-series that doesn't represent the books in a good way but movies I see in a different way (cause its impossible to do a whole book in a movie both in character development and story). There's also strange critics from reviewers here in IMDb saying that this a corny feminist story. Maybe because its females in the lead roles, that can be to much for some. I just find this critic so weird that I have to think that this kind of thinking is a product of the Trump era.

306,shaht-16429,"Fan's of the novel should be satisfied, but that's about it.",6,4 March 2017,"The Girl on the Train is the adaptation of Paula Hawkins' thriller mystery book of the same name. It tells the story of Rachel Watson (Blunt), an unemployed alcoholic who recently divorced from her husband Tom (Theroux), now married to his new wife Anna (Ferguson). Rachel rides the train every day and passes a house with a seemingly perfect couple, Megan (Bennett) and Scott (Evans), she will sometimes make stories about them and dream about them because it was the life she lost. However, one day she sees Megan having an affair, then the next day she goes missing. Rachel thinks she saw her from the train but her alcohol induced blackouts make her an unreliable narrator in this murder mystery that is really more of a melodrama, wanting to be like Gone Girl but turning into a Lifetime Original Movie.First and foremost Emily Blunt is truly exceptional in the role of Rachel, her character is very sympathetic even as someone who has done supposedly terrible things while inebriated. She elevates the movie when it slows down, and in this movie, that happens a lot. Even though her character is supposed to ugly and fat in the book, she pulls the off alcoholic persona masterfully. Haley Bennett is also relatively good as Megan. There were a lot of layers to her character, and she did a great job translating her to screen, however everyone else is aggressively average. Ferguson, Theroux, Janney, Evans are all talented actors, however come off as one- dimensional and serve as plot drivers, their acting is good, however there is no substance to their characters. The book sets up an intriguing thriller mystery, using the unreliable narrator trope to its advantage, however this does not translate well to film. The book uses an unreliable narrator by cutting between 3 first person narrators, with Rachel driving the story, Megan driving the background and Anna hammering down the twist ending. The film ignores Anna's story, and only gives a fraction of the screen time to Megan's while Rachel will get most of the spotlight, effectively driving both the story and attempting to hammer down the twist ending. There are parts that are well crafted, there are some true moments of suspense, one scene involving a tunnel, one involving a cell phone and another involving Lisa Kudrow, however they are few and far between, surrounded by moments of Rachel being drunk and unintentionally messing up lives. The Girl on the Train wants to be intriguing, it wants to be suspenseful, however it does not have the right camera-work, the right film score, or even titillating dialogue to jump-start an enthralling premise.The film wants to be Gone Girl, the book even compares itself to it, however it does not have Atticus Ross or Trent Reznor as composers, Jeff Cronenweth as a cinematographer, nor does it have David Fincher as a director. The directing in this movie is very flat, there are some scenes that could have been suspenseful, for example near the beginning there is a drummer. If they continued his drum-roll throughout the entire scene while Rachel was in a drunken stupor, that would put me on the edge of my seat, however there was no score for that scene and I remained unfazed. There is also another fight scene at the end of the movie, where two characters face off against the main antagonist, it is filmed and directed so sub-par, what could be gripping turned into boring. Also the cinematography in this film is way below average, and I am the kind of person that would not pay attention to that. Scenes in broad daylight look impressively dull, scenes indoors look very dim and grey, while scene at night don't even look that dark.In the end, I wanted to enjoy the film even when it was getting mixed reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, despite a number of plot conveniences and nothing really to think about at the end. The novel was suspenseful when it wanted to be and it had more fleshed out characters and villains. Its a faithful adaptation of its source material, the only large difference is its location change and the portrayal of Rachel. So if all you are looking for is faithfulness you will not be too disappointed, if you're looking a well directed, mystery with an unreliable narrator, great, deceptive characters and a chilling atmosphere, I would suggest David Fincher's Gone Girl or Bryan Singer's the Usual Suspects.",The Girl on the Train

I disagree with professional critics that found the movie sluggish, melodramatic, convoluted or predictable.

Thats where I'm like, ""so did he drug her?"" Every flashback she looks wasted, and I don't particulary know why. 
Emily Blunt is a great actress, but I feel that this was a bit of downfall for her, I was too frustrated to even properly watch the movie, every second she was always wasted, which was really annoying and rather confusing in most of the scenes. I mean the very last scene was the only scene where she's actually sober. But hey, we've all got our opinions, and then I know she's drinking because she can't get over the fact that she can't have kids and her husband broke up with her and married the mistress, who in return could create a baby, in which Rachel so desperetly wanted.

310,jsrobinson132,A psychological thriller with all forms of twists and turns displaying the horrors and pitfalls found on the dark side of humanity,8,28 October 2016,"Small Spoiler Alert:Over the last few weeks, I have read conflicting reviews for this movie, though they didn't put me off wanting to go and see it for myself. It appeared that most of the naysayers were people who have already read the book, while those who hadn't delved into Paula Hawkins' novel mostly seemed to enjoy the cinematic experience.As a published author, I much prefer seeing the movie first and then follow it by reading the book. It seems that by using this means, I can enjoy the film without having a full understanding of the storyline and conclusion, especially if it is of the thriller genre where I undergo the full climatic intrigue. By reading the novel afterwards, I then get the entire experience, including those sections necessarily omitted from a movie due to the restrictions that come with thick tomes condensed into a mere 90 to 120 minutes duration, along with the thought processes of each individual character, which can often be left out of a film version. Being able to picture the characters and locations, even if may they differ to the author's description to an extent, often adds to the enjoyment of each scene.This week I went along to the cinema and wasn't at all surprised to find I enjoyed this psychological thriller set around a young divorcée with a shocking drinking problem that stems from a broken heart. Rachel is obsessed with her ex-husband, Tom, along with Anna and Evie, his new wife and baby, and a seemingly very much in love young couple – Scott and Megan – who live only two doors away from the home she once shared with Tom. Every day, twice a day, she spies on both couples from the third carriage of the train she catches to her supposed job in New York City – anxiously peering in on their activities and then dealing with the aftermath of witnessing their happiness through the comfort of a long drink bottle filled with Vodka.One night, following Rachel discovering Megan in a compromising position earlier that very day, the attractive young female neighbour goes missing. Arriving at her home that same night, drunk and with bloodstains, cuts and bruises, and no memory of whether she was involved in the young woman's disappearance, Rachel is terrified as well as fascinated to get to the bottom of what may have occurred. Consequently, she sets off using her own detective skills to find out what exactly happened and where she fits into this awful event. When the police become involved, she manages to wheedle her way into the lives of both couples by using detailed lies and subterfuge, along with a truckload of guts and determination while facing her own set of demons. The ending is completely unexpected and a ghastly and vivid insight into what truly went on in the minds of several of these characters – and most especially one. Watching the storyline unfold took me back to my court reporting days when I sat transcribing proceedings from a desk on 'the other side of crime' while listening to the gruesome and cruel things supposedly sane people do to each other.The Girl on the Train is well worth a look if you can handle seeing humanity in all of its horribleness and gruesome brutality when hatred and revenge are let loose. Emily Blunt played the role of the young heartbroken alcoholic brilliantly, while the other characters involved fed her terrors and sadness with excellent portrayals of life in the suburbia she still longs for.",The Girl on the Train

312,ameesha-green,Location and setting all wrong!,2,11 July 2020,"""The Girl on the Train"" novel was exciting, fast-paced, and kept you guessing. The film adaptation was slow, boring, and who cared what happened.For me, the biggest issue was the setting. The setting is key to the book. It's about a woman who gets the train every day across London, and as anyone knows who has ever got a train in London (or another big UK city), the train tracks run along the back of people's houses, particularly the Victorian terraced houses, close enough to see inside. In these houses, you can hear your neighbours moving around, you live practically on top of each other. Because of this setting, Rachel is able to see into the lives of the people who live there.In the film adaptation, Hollywood switching the setting to rural America. The train goes slowly (for no apparent reason) past huge houses with balconies, and she sees into their lives from there, which seems highly unlikely considering the distance from the train track to the house and the speed the trains would travel at in a rural location. It makes absolutely no sense for the film to be set in America and loses a key element of the book.Continuing with the mess of the setting, they cast a British actress (Blunt) and a Swedish actress who sounds British (Ferguson). Blunt's Englishness is jarring and even her great acting can't save this film. If you're going to cast people who sound British in a book where the key setting was London, then why set the film in America? I can't fathom why they thought that was a good idea.Somehow, the combination of the setting, the music, and the pace of the film means that what was an exciting book becomes slow and boring. It lacks tension, action, and drama. In essence, it just comes across a bit flat.",The Girl on the Train
313,gerick_goldwyn,Why weren't more women in the audience offended by this movie?,4,2 January 2017,"After hearing The Girl on Train was based on a bestselling novel, I was really looking forward to seeing it; especially after hearing it was being compared to movies like Nocturnal Animals and Gone Girl. However, after seeing it tonight, I am left with mixed emotions. Some reviews online call it depressing, manhating, and an all-out, over-the-top soap opera. I, on the other hand, definitely thought the movie had something but was poorly executed. I also thought the first 2/3 of the film was a scrabbled mess, where the final third of the film was the whole movie. My fiancé tells me that the book is much better, so I'll probably read it at some point to put the movie into some perspective. I didn't think the movie was manhating at all. Although, I can't deny that Tom (Justin Theroux) was a complete psycho and ultimately deserved to be killed by the women he mistreated. If anything, I thought the film couldn't have made the women in the film look more stupid, or utterly brainless. I thought only Rachel (Emily Blunt), to spite being a mentally unstable alcoholic, was the only decent (female) character in the film. I couldn't even imagine what my life would look like after surviving a monster like Tom. I also thought she was incredibly brave to face that psycho at the end of the film, and risk everything to save Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and her child. I don't know how many other people would risk their lives to save the person who destroyed their marriage. Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) for example, said at one point: ""She enjoyed being the other woman."" I am sure it must have been the proudest moment of her life to completely destroy Rachel's marriage and leave her life in ruins; and then to see her at the end of the film looking completely shattered (or even surprised) to hear that her husband (Tom) was sleeping with half the city during their affaire and was currently sleeping with the nanny (Megan) under their very roof and in their bed. It's what we call karma, my dear; if you're stupid enough to marry a man who has a long history of cheating on his ex-wife, don't cry about it when he finally cheats on you too. Megan (Haley Bennett), who is a married woman, having unprotected sex with 3 different men in her life, 1 including Tom, while simultaneously trying to get pregnant with her husband. Why on earth would she ever get involved with a cheating scumbag like Tom is simply beyond me; a man, who she knows, has a long history of cheating on his wives and his mistresses. He sounds like a keeper, a real Prince Charming I would have thought most women are smarter than this? She had a decent man at home (who loved her) and here she is sleeping with both her Boss (Tom) and her psychologist, Dr. Kamal (Edgar Ramírez), and who knows how many others. I think what Rachel called her in the tunnel was more than justified... and, then to watch Tom beat the sh*t out of Rachel and then to willing walk into the woods with him alone – it doesn't say much for her intelligence does it - why didn't she just call the Grim Ripper ahead of time and book in an appointment? And, finally there's Detective Riley (Allison Janney). She's so focused on pinning Megan's death on Rachel that she was unable to connect A with B. After learning that Megan was pregnant (and ruling out both her husband and Dr. Kamal as the father), I am surprised a DETECTIVE wouldn't use their initiative to look into Tom. Detective Riley knew absolutely everything about Rachel but didn't think to look into her crazy ex- husband as well. Instead, it was a mentally unhinged alcoholic that cracked the case. It doesn't say much for Detective Riley does it? I think each of these 3 characters, in some point in the film, could have asked themselves: If I only had a brain? I am surprised more girls weren't upset by this film? I know a lot of very strong, smart, intelligent women in my life – people I actually look up too, and could easily run rings round me – and here they are being depicted as just idiots..",The Girl on the Train

317,KristianZacc,The Movie That Shocked No One,6,27 October 2016,"Minor/Vague SpoilersAnother movie about another book about another murder mystery sounds familiar because it is!! If War Dogs was the wannabe Wolf of Wall Street, this was the wannabe Gone Girl. I would like to point out that, yes I had the somewhat misfortune for having read the book prior to seeing this film. I say misfortune because the book wasn't the best read either, definitely an easy read just not compelling, or very difficult to figure out where it is going to end up. Many people would compare this to Gone Girl as it is following that same path of taking an extremely popular novel and adapting that to film and, for me, that worked to perfection. Off the top of my head it was probably my favourite movie of 2014 and it was because of the hype from both that made me quite excited to see The Girl on the Train. To be frank, it was quite underwhelming. The whole movie feels very melodramatic, as if I'm watching something on The CW and that I did not like. There are decisions that characters make that just make zero sense to me but what else should I expect from CW The Movie. Emily Blunt knocks it out of the park which isn't unexpected because she is always perfect in every role she plays. She plays the main character who rides the train everyday and lives vicariously through the people she sees through the window. These fantasies, especially with one couple, become a big fixation for her. Until one day where she sees something that shocks her which kicks off the main storyline of this whodunit style movie. She was also the only thing that was British in this film. I say this because the book takes place in England and for the film they moved it to the U.S. why? I have no clue but I don't really care either. She was one of the few that felt like they had actually sunk themselves into the role and was playing a character and not just ""acting"".Justin Theroux is someone who is one of my favourite actors currently working. Seeing him in The Leftovers which is a series I absolutely love made me very excited to see him have a role in this film. He was really the only other character in the film that I felt was taking their role very seriously. For me, almost every other character felt like they could have been just reading their lines right off the script. Laura Prepon who I really liked in That 70s Show and Orange is the New Black felt very off, as if she didn't want to be there. This all falls down to the writing, which at times was very cringeworthy, and it wasn't up to any quality that Gone Girl was and it's an insult to think it is anything close. Obviously it was just used as a marketing device, as well as their ""The Thriller That Shocked the World"" tagline, to get people in seats in the theatre. Every character has zero redeemable qualities and in the novel I quite enjoyed it because you got to read the insights of the three main characters, Rachel (Emily Blunt), Anna (Rebecca Ferguson), Megan (Haley Bennett), however, in the movie there is no real context for anything except for the beginning where you get Emily Blunt narrating events that happened on screen. The narration as well was something that at times was very pointless and felt like the film was treating me like an absolute idiot. Specifically, there is a scene where a news report is playing and you get everything from just that but they also play Emily Blunt's character narrating the events that happened which is unnecessary because we are just getting the same information. This isn't the only time that happens either. So, I would recommend just waiting and seeing the film later once it comes out on Blu-Ray or whatever cable TV channel. The movie was very vapid and lacked any kind of tension that it should've had.",The Girl on the Train
318,foundsomefun,What a waste of time.,1,14 January 2018,Not my type of movie. This is NOT a mystery. It is a character study of wretched unlikable people tied together by loose threads.

I also don't understand why they changed the location, the race of the therapist, the police officer that Rachel primarily deals with, cut out Anna pretty much altogether, and just basically made Kathy disappear after very little appearance anyway with no boyfriend.

My son rented this and I wish he could get his money back. I found myself disappearing every ten minutes and when I came back, I knew exactly what was going on. It was like watching a soap.

Unlike an author who can devote paragraphs to psychological detail, a filmmaker must find abbreviated ways to get inside a character's head. Emily Blunt's performance as the alternately sedated and explosive Rachel is by far the film's highlight. The other leads all have their moments, but mostly stick to clichés.The most glaring downside (for me) was that the police detectives seem far more interested in melodrama than forensic science.",The Girl on the Train

The director I would compare it to, even more, is Brian DePalma, because of the use of the many flashbacks and the - maybe more than necessary - use of explicit violence and blood. But the latter ones may depend on the cut.The point, that makes me downgrade it a bit, is the fact, that the story heavily relies on Rachels memory loss due to being wasted, stressed and getting hit, and no other witnesses, and the necessary details coming back, when the telling needs some push, to go on.At least, there is no illogical, forced turn or surprise in the post-final phase, to play a last joke or twist on the audience (like in Basic Instinct).",The Girl on the Train
324,wilhelm-22,"Good acting and atmosphere, problematic script & editing",5,10 September 2021,"I quite enjoyed this film while watching it, especially thanks to the acting from Emily Blunt and Haley Bennet and the melancholy autumnal atmosphere. The concept of having an alcoholic as an ""unreliable narrator"" is an interesting one, and Blunt did a good job at portraying the pain of that disease.However the film has many problems, especially with the script, and to some extent the editing.The film is unnecessarily confusing with random jumps back and forwards in time, making the timeline almost impossible to follow. The whole framework with the main character watching people from the train and obsessing about them would make sense in a movie where these fantasies were an important element of the story. In this case they are not, though, since the filmmakers leave that concept very early on as Emily starts to interact with the people.Emily's character is quite well written (although her alcoholism comes and goes dependng on what's convenient for the story). However Rebecca Fergusen isn't given enough screen time to develop her character at all. Haley Bennet gets more time, but ironically her character is of no importance for the story itself. The men are all two dimensional villains.To me the film is worth a watch. But with a slightly better script it could have turned into something much better. It surprises me how many films nowadays fail because of the script, as a script is a comparably small cost in a big production.",The Girl on the Train

It has themes of doubt, dependency, abuse, mental confusion, tension, betrayal, lust, abandonment, fear, irony, dysfunction and pure evil.

The trailers had led me to believe this might be the case for The Girl on the Train. How wrong I was.The screenplay and direction were often sloppy while the editing was so messy it often felt like scenes were pieced together purely at random. I really struggled to warm to or identify with any of the characters in a film where all men are portrayed as controlling and deplorable and any sense of female empowerment is lost amidst the absurdity of the relentlessly twisting plot.I have to call out Emily Blunt's stunning lead performance - she steals every scene she's in with a nuanced, conflicted and honest portrayal of a complex and intriguing character. Quality support performances from Luke Evans and Haley Bennet help but don't save the movie and most other characters are so slight and one-dimensional that they fade into the background.The Girl on the Train felt like Gone Girl without the tension, emotion or drama.5/10",The Girl on the Train

Well, I wasn't living under a rock and I had in fact heard of the film. I even saw the cinema listings. But for some reason the movie never really registered with me. I saw no ads or trailers anywhere and subsequently I had no idea what the movie was all about either; it was just quietly sitting on the shelf so to speak.Which is a shame really, as I discovered almost by accident. In search of something to watch this week I went through the listings and saw that the movie was still running. So, I quickly checked out the trailer. It looked reasonably interesting and the decision to watch the film was made.It's decision that I am very glad about, because it is an excellent movie.Spoiler Alert!This is an in depth review of the movie. Please be aware that I discuss the story, therefore some spoilers are inevitable. Read on at your own discretion.Who is the girl on the train?Rachel Watson is a chronically drunk girl, who rides on the train into New York every day. She constantly nurses a bottle of what seems to be water at first. We later learn that the bottle is actually filled with alcohol instead of water. This explains why she is getting drunker by the hour as the day progresses.The train passes the house she used to live in with her now ex-husband. She obsessively stalks said ex-husband from the train, and as it turns out otherwise, who lives in the house now with his new wife and their baby daughter.While she's at it, she also keeps track of the young couple next door to her ex. She envies them their perfect life, which she perceives to be full of love, romance and passion. Rachel wants this kind of life for herself, but she realises that in her broken alcoholic state she is nowhere near of getting it.The story is very cleverly told from the perspective of all three women: Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) - the girl on the train, Anna Watson (Rebecca Ferguson) - the new wife and Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) - the girl next door.The disappearanceOne day Rachel witnesses Megan on the balcony of her house with another man. They seem close, kissing. Rachel gets upset, because she feels that the other woman is about to throw her perfect life away. In her drunken stupor she gets off the train to confront Megan.The next morning she wakes up with blood and bruises all over her face and body. She realises that she can't remember anything that happened the previous evening. To her horror she is then interviewed by the police about her whereabouts that night because Megan has disappeared.Rachel realises that she is unable to recollect important points in her life. Up until her divorce her husband told her what she's been up to in her drunken fit. But now she just has gaps in her memory. She decides to sober up and joins the AA for help. In an effort to gain back her sanity and to find out what really happened that fateful night she starts her own investigation into Megan's disappearance, which turns all the more urgent when Megan's body is found in the nearby woods.Final thoughtsEmily Blunt is putting on an incredible performance in her portrayal of Rachel Watson. I can only imagine the emotional drain of filming some of the scenes. The wobbly and shaky camera work really supports the drunken stages of the character, slowly becoming steady and into focus as Rachel sobers up.As it turns out neither Anna nor Megan have perfect lives, which comes as no surprise to anyone watching. But the realisation of the truth about this undeniable fact in life helps Rachel to cope with battling her own demons.The role of the ex-husband Tom Watson is played by Justin Theroux. I have not seen much of him yet. To be honest I only know of him because of his marriage to Jennifer Aniston. And while I'm sure that he is a perfectly nice person in real life, Mr. Aniston plays a creep worryingly well. His performance turns from protective husband to creep to sinister in one big smooth sweeping motion.A small but pivotal role is played by Lisa Kudrow. She plays Martha, the wife of Tom's ex- boss, who's input sets events in motion that eventually lead to solving the mystery.Overall I am really glad I watched this movie, because it is an excellent story told in a really interesting and brilliant way.",The Girl on the Train

If you haven't seen many thrillers, then it may keep you hooked for a while. But if you have been around the block, then you'd know much of the story is more like a filler that serves for masking the fact that this movie lacks a true brilliant twist--the thriller movies' HG.The cast is good. Especially Emily Blunt. Her performance in the first 5 min could be in a master class of acting.The camera work is good too. The atmosphere reminds me of an 'old' movie by Polanski 'The Ghost Writer'. But Polanski does it better.Now, what I really have problem with is the whole set up of three psychotic women running their lives around men, marriage (or the lack of), and babies (or the lack of). This story, if not for the modern set up, could be easily mistaken as happened prior to 'I Love Lucy'. Through the whole movie, I couldn't help but thinking those people are just sealed in a time capsule from 50s and be taken to the current days by the Tardis.Does it mean only psychotic women with no self-esteem make a good thriller? Or does it mean this movie lacks imagination and a good taste? You be the judge.",The Girl on the Train
340,duncan_buchanan,Book is much better but it's not terrible,6,4 April 2018,"Just finished reading the book which I thoroughly enjoyed, it was gripping, thrilling and really made you constantly wonder about who dunnit. The format in which it was written from several character perspectives over a short period of time also lended itself very well to the way it read. A very easy read.However, the film suffers from poor editing. It really switches and changes far too quickly from different times, characters randomly appear with little explanation (ie Abdic) that I think if I hadn't read the book I'd have struggled to keep up with it coherently.Nearly all the characters are short changed, especially Luke Evans as Scott. virtually everyone to a degree seem to get large chunks of their character development expunged, to the detriment of the overall film.Emily Blunt plays the part pitch perfect although I struggle to accept her as how the character in the book is described. Also, the location moving to the states doesn't add anything to the film other than maybe getting more interest from the US audience. Do we really need another film set in or near New York?So in summary, if it had remained in London, been edited much tighter but given more scenes from the book to allow for character development and the actors were given more time to shine I think it would have been much more faithful and enjoyable, if thats the right word to describe the subject matter.It's not a - buy to keep and rewatch kinda film... Watch it on Netflix or Rent it and watch it one, but I recommend the book first. Either way the other you with or read first will ruin the experience of the other but I think reading it will just make you wan to watch it, whereas watching it won't really make you want to read it afterwards, which would be a terrible shame.",The Girl on the Train
341,JMCReelReviews,It's stand-out performances from Blunt and Hayley Bennett that ultimately make this worth sticking with.,6,8 January 2017,"Paula Hawkins' acclaimed novel is brought to the big screen by The Help director Tate Taylor and stars Emily Blunt as Rachel, a divorced alcoholic obsessed with a couple she sees on her daily commute.With an intrinsic plot and interchange of characters and relationships, The Girl On The Train promises to be a taut, intricate, intense thriller. Perhaps the book is, but unfortunately the film does not live up to this promise.There are various flaws, particularly regarding the pitch, pace and tone of the film; Taylor's constant cuts, edits and switching of story-arcs occur so frequently that they become distracting and result in a failure to produce any tempo or even tension, ultimately leading to a somewhat flat finale.However, it does offer enough to maintain interest and the established source material thankfully ensured story-telling remained coherent, but it's stand-out performances from Blunt and Hayley Bennett that ultimately make this worth sticking with.They are both terrific in their respective roles as tormented, grieving young women. Bennett's emotional performance equals Blunt's physical delivery and they are both extraordinarily captivating, drawing in and maintaining the audience's focus to the very end. They stand head and shoulders above their male counterparts and ultimately save this film from becoming an overly mundane experience.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/",The Girl on the Train
342,johns6087,Good Mystery-Thriller,6,12 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train is a decent enough mystery-thriller in my opinion.Emily Blunt stars as Rachel Watson. Rachel has been divorced and became an alcoholic. Like many working stiffs she takes the same train to work every single day. On her train journey, Rachel watches and ends up fantasizing about the relationship of two of her ex- husband's neighbours, Scott (Luke Evans) and Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett). She also can't stop thinking about her ex-husband and his wonderful new wife, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson).Becoming crazier and less stable, Rachel spirals out of control especially once she ends up in a mysterious missing persons investigation that will frighten her and change her life forever.Based on the best-selling novel by Paula Hawkins, The Girl on the Train is a lot like David Fincher's Gone Girl, though it is not as good. People would probably like this movie more had it come out before Gone Girl. The twist ending is a little predictable for my taste but the acting is good, the writing is fair, and it is a good enough way to waste a couple hours in a theater or better yet wait and watch it for free on TV :)",The Girl on the Train
343,Alex-Siddhi,A remarkable adaptation,9,14 October 2016,"This is a striking thriller, adapted very accurately and respectively from the Number one best seller book. It is a romance gone wrong in all places, the characters have this triangular relationship in which their lives become tangled up in each others for the worse. The one major difference in this film is that it is based in New York rather than London, but location wise it is spot on.For those who haven't read the book it begins with Rachel, the unsteady protagonist, and the unreliable narrator who is suffering with alcoholism and obsession after her divorce with Tom who belongs to the 2nd group with his wife Anna and their daughter Evie. Rachel becomes obsessed with the 3rd group who live 5 doors down from Tom and Anna and are also a happy couple who she names Jess and Jason. But eventually she learns they are not as happy as she sees them from the window view of her usual train seat, and they are named Megan and Scott Hipwell. And from one event, it changes everything, Rachel become fixated on figuring things out which only leads to more negative outcomes, and more mysteries.The main elements in this film I would say are paranoia, anxiety, failure, obsession, envy and lust, and they are explored very well visually and audibly. Rachel is ascending into a world of self loathing and drinks heavily every day, she gets the train every day and lies to people because she doesn't trust anyone, and she forgets what she has done the night before. When she takes her alcoholic troubles to Beckett Street, it mixes her story with the stories of the other two groups. Megan has a past that she hasn't told anyone before and inevitably it comes back to haunt her, she is a nymphomaniac who only feels like herself when she is running away. Scott is obsessive over her and possessive too. But her story involves Tom and Anna too when she baby sits Evie. Tom is a confident strong man who is madly in love with Anna, a strong caring mother.As said before the film follows the book very closely and has exceptional performances from Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett & Luke Evans, it is my opinion that the other actors were also great but possibly because these 3 in particular had the demanding roles they really did a great job and you notice it. Key points for their acting skills I would say are how Emily portrays an alcoholic who looks truly broken in the face especially but also in her body language and she comes across unstable and unpredictable but you can see that she is a sweet harmless girl inside deep down. Hayley plays Megan very well as she is quite sadistic in her sexual nature, and it is shown well how events from her past have affected these traits of her character. And Luke gives a quiet performance to begin with but has outbursts later on that shock us as they shock the characters, and so it is these unstable and unpredictable characters that are interesting to watch.Visually it is very accurate in the exploration of anxiety, hangovers, and recovering memories, but perceiving the memories blurred and altered, there are sequences where Rachel is trying to recover her memories and it is achingly gripping because of the intensity in the shots, the mysteries of the culprit and the victim(s) and sliced together with the deep soundtrack it is very special.With twists and turns this compelling original dark romance thriller was adapted very well and I give it a 8.5 out of 10.",The Girl on the Train
344,florentinamayliemhassan,The biggest mistake I've ever made....,3,25 November 2016,"I have just finished the book hours ago and I watched the movie right away. What?.... Did I just hear something? Yeah... it's just the sound of my EXPLODING BRAIN! What the f*ck did I just watch? A complete bullshit? Yes. The problem with the movie is that the novel was amazing, gripping, well-delivered and it gave us that tiny little details that we couldn't get from the movie. I'm not being rude now and I love thriller and mystery and crime but WT Hell was this? Some of the scenes were just different from the novel and it hadn't been done once. Movie was fast, no character development, lacks of explanations and if you don't read the book probably you'll be like ""What did I just watch? Who the hell is Kamal? Who is Megan and others like that."" It's also contains a lot of sex scenes which consumed the time that could be used to tell us more details. I can say that this is the example of book-adaptation failure. I saw some lost details for some times. Rachel were supposedly fat and she drank alcohol right from the bottle, not from like-a-toddler bottle. SHE LIVED IN London, NOT IN MANHATTAN you #@$%^!!! Supposedly Kamal had dark skin and an Indian, not some kind of Venezuelan actor who tried to be Indian. Did Rachel even like to draw? Does alcoholic even draw (sorry no offense). And Megan was supposedly small but not this Megan. This kind of Megan was 1.7 Meter. Megan supposedly wore RED T-SHIRT not a RED JACKET!!! And do you even realized when Tom hit Rachel that her head wasn't bleeding. OH MY GOSH... Am I the only one who had noticed this? If I haven't read the book, probably I'll give it a 5 or 6. The reason I didn't give this sh&* a 0 because Emily Blunt portrayed Rachel pretty well and the cinematography, damn, I have to admit that the shots were beautiful. Haley Bennett also played pretty well, but in some scenes she acted like amateur but at other scenes she acted like Oscars Winner. Other actors? Were they even played there? Oh, sorry I didn't notice because I was busy praising at Blunt's acting skill, Bennett's beauty and the well-shot scene. AND WHY TATE? WHY YOU'RE SO MEAN? DID I DO ANYTHING WRONG TO YOU? I LIKE THE HELP BUT WT HECK IS THIS? DON'T EVER TOUCH MY FAVORITE BOOK. EVER.",The Girl on the Train

Movies below 6 are are often rubbish, one have to rate 7 or up to rate a good movie. This is a good movie. The plot is not super-original, but it is original above the average thriller. Rachel, the main caracter, alcoholized, is suberbly played by Emily Blunt.

346,starburst-16601,Interesting,7,15 October 2016,"This movie was not as bad and not as good as I was expecting it to be. I thought it'd be good because of the amazing marketing they did got my expectations up then I thought it'd be bad based on the 6.8 score IMDb gave it. This made me torn on seeing it, but for the sake of Emily Blunt (she is amazing) I went anyway and am glad I did. Granted it isn't perfect, but it's still a good movie going experience with a really good twist. All of the actors are spot on and Emily Blunt blows my mind with her spot on drunkenness. It was the first non comedic drunk person performance I've seen and it was...haunting due to the realism. If you have any reservations on seeing the movie, go just to see these beautiful actors do brilliant work (especially the ladies, hats off). The criticism comes from the film making. There were way too many closeups that took away from the story. The film style worked when they were showing drunken hazy memories and flashbacks, but detracted the rest of the time. Their more artsy cinematographic choices could've been better appreciated if they had taken a more European style of shooting for general scenes(I'm thinking Amour) with wide shots so we can see the starkness of the whole picture. That change would've also helped us understand characters better if we could see for ourselves how they interacted with their environment rather than the film makers zooming in on what they wanted us to see. In thrillers the audience likes to play detective and with wide shots we could've tried to find the clues ourselves, without that role for the audience I think that left us slightly detached. But maybe that's intentional since the character herself is so detached from reality. Nevertheless I enjoyed watching the movie because I wanted to know what happened and the truth didn't fail to surprise me at the end like a true thriller does. I give it a solid 7. Emily Blunt kicks ass, go see this movie.",The Girl on the Train
347,elaineoshocko,"Great Cast, Great ideas, just a bit rushed.",5,20 August 2018,"It is always difficult for a film to fully live up to the book, but it was well thought out but it could never be perfect. It focuses mainly on the main character ofcourse but the other female characters did not get the full attention they deserved. If one questions the other female characters and their actions, the book will provide you the clarity you seek. Revealing the villain in the end was less than riveting, he did not get enough screen time throughout the film to get to know him or care that he was ever there at all. There was no adequate confrontation and it ended at the click of two fingers. The climax deserved some extra time. As a whole, the cast is great and they did the best they could.

It started alright but just never really went anywhere in terms of drama, intrigue, pace, suspense or any of the key components of a murder mystery thriller. By the end of the film you just don't feel anything for any of the film's main characters. Having not read the book, I can't say whether the book is suspenseful but the film has less drama than the current Southern rail conductors strikes. When eventually the killer confronts Emily Blunt's character you really don't give a flying fig.

352,david-m-b95,A largely successful thriller which faces a few setbacks along the way,6,5 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train tells the story of the titular girl, Rachel (Emily Blunt), a troubled, alcoholic, divorcée who commutes every day on the train to Manhattan, each journey is the same and she passes the same road of houses, stopping long enough to observe them. Among those that Rachel sees daily is that of a beautiful, yet mysterious couple (played by Luke Evans and Haley Bennett) who seem to live the perfect life, a marriage and life that Rachel pines for. This is made all the more difficult for Rachel given that her ex- husband Tom (Justin Theroux) and his new wife Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) live just a few houses away with their child. But through all of this snooping, Rachel sees something she shouldn't and soon becomes drawn much more into the lives of these strangers than she ever could have expected.First off, the good: -Emily Blunt as Rachel. This is a complex and totally different performance than what we've seen Blunt deliver before. She is outstanding; damaged, conflicted, helpless and passionate, it's a role which asks a lot from Blunt but she hits the mark. It's convincingly ambiguous, credit for this must also go to Taylor whose direction never allows us to truly sympathise or side with any of these characters. Blunt's conviction makes it that much harder to support this supposed ""hero"" of the story.-Haley Bennett's performance as Megan. As her story unravels, Bennett is really able to sink her teeth into the role and manipulate the image of her character and our perception of her. Megan is a devilishly devious individual and Bennett truly does the character justice giving a performance with real bite and venom. -Luke Evans and, of course, Allison Janney. They are undoubtedly the other stand out performances from the ensemble. Evans, who plays Megan's husband Scott, plays his role with similar venom to Bennett as he offers yet another ambiguous and intriguing performance for the film. Janney may be playing a rather generic police role, she is, as always, stellar as she delivers real authority and control in her performance despite her limited material.-Tate Taylor's overall direction. If a little rushed and sloppy in places, Taylor's direction is largely very good and he examines some interesting themes and motifs.-For fans of the book, this is a very faithful adaptation (location change aside).The Problems: -The characterisation is not particularly deep on backstory, so it's hard to fully ""get"" some of these characters.-Its stumbles out of the blocks and takes time to really settle. There are some clunky and unnatural moments in the script both in dialogue and narration and it's a bit of a rush to get into the characters and story. -Regardless of its solid overall build, the film tries to throw a little too much to see what sticks at first. -The performances take a little while to settle as well, Bennett in particular seems too unnatural in her performance before her intentions with the role become clearer and she seems more comfortable. -It could take some time to adapt to Blunt's performance also given how drastically different this is to her usual work, but nonetheless do not let yourself be deterred from her performance too quickly.-Rebecca Ferguson isn't given much material and is rather bland. Justin Theroux as well is a little caricature like, he isn't very convincing and comes across rather bland especially when compared to the stronger performances of the film.Despite a few early stumbles, The Girl on the Train is a dark thriller anchored by a great performance from Emily Blunt and held together by some good direction from Tate Taylor.",The Girl on the Train

354,thechoctopfilmblog,An unambitious and mundane mystery,4,9 October 2016,"Based on Paula Hawkin's novel of the same name, 'The Girl on the Train' is a predictable mystery thriller that lacks suspense and originality. The premise itself is inventive, but the film failed to offer excitement that I so looked forward to.Emily Blunt gives a powerful performance as Rachel, a depressed alcoholic who rides the train everyday to Manhattan and back. She is obsessed with spying on her and her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux)'s house (which can be conveniently seen from the train), and his new life with Anna (Rebecca Ferguson), a girl he cheated on her with. The story gets messy when Megan (Haley Bennett), who lived next door and is a nanny employed by Anna and Tom, goes missing and Rachel is suddenly personally involved in the chaos.Blunt has to sacrifice her beauty for this role and she was as compelling and real as she could be given the circumstances. Her forlorn, lifeless appearance suited the film's dark and dreary mood. Sadly, the characters are just as colourless. The film could only afford a singular exploration of their emotions and they had no opportunities to create depth to their personalities. You've seen stereotypes of those characters all before.The story itself is excessively melodramatic. I was hoping that it was more than just your standard affair mystery, but as it turns out, it was exactly that. The time jumps designed to create more suspense for revelations was instead confusing for the audience, given that we already have to follow three separate story lines simultaneously.A great mystery thriller usually keeps me pondering, wondering, and enthralled throughout. This 'Girl on the Train' however, sucks all your energy out and leaves you feeling empty. I felt exhausted sitting through this film. Apart from a couple of shockingly brutal scenes, there is really nothing in this film that would get your heart pumping. The final revelation of the villain is staged at a point that you realise there couldn't really be anyone else.This is such a disappointing film that if I was on the train to witness the story, I would have looked the other way.",The Girl on the Train

358,gmfude,Watch it to see how good Emily Blunt really is,7,22 November 2020,"It's not the greatest of films, which disappointed me because Paula Hawkins' book on which it was closely based was a fabulous piece of writing. Hawkins captured the main character's self-destructive alcoholism so well. Perhaps the biggest let-down was changing the milieu from crowded, stuffy England to the broad open spaces of the USA.But The Girl on the Train is certainly watchable as an enjoyable thriller, one I'd normally rate as a six out of ten, a good evening-filler that'll keep you guessing albeit at a slow pace.It gets an extra star from me for Emily Blunt's performance. I've heard it said a few times that playing a drunk is one of the hardest roles, it is so easy to overplay and have every scene slide into the ridiculous. Blunt is terrific in the titular role. It may be one of her best, and she was nominated for both BAFTA and SAG awards.

360,tcheriko,Gaslighting as seen by the victim,8,7 January 2021,"I have undertaken this review to counter the negative ones, especially those comparing this film to the totally irrelevant Gone Girl. In my view, the film is a new and improved configuration of the classic film Gaslight, 1944 (I have not seen the earlier British version of 1940).As in Gaslight, this film concerns a husband ensnaring his wife with lies to convince her she was insane or otherwise inadequate. Hence the psychological term ""gaslighting"" for this kind of abuse. The basic idea is the same, even though the plot details differ. More importantly, the psychological angle is much more developed, making the film a vastly improved version of the 1944 original.The story is told from the deliberately narrow point of view of the abused wife, Rachel. For this reason, it fully develops only two characters: Rachel herself as she observes everyone else, and her idealized model Megan, who turns out to be anything but. All other characters are fleeting shadows as seen by Rachel, therefore otherwise undeveloped (and rightly so).We meet Rachel after the separation from her husband, her personality still devastated by his gaslighting of her. The next stage is cognitive dissonance, at first concerning Megan and then others. This leads to recognizing truths, which in turn leads to recovery.

I realized how readily I was willing to cast suspicion on the women characters, as though the men were innocently responding to the craziness of the women. Halfway through I happily suspected Anna of setting Rachel up. When Megan cheated, I judged her harshly. But silently forgave the psychiatrist as being weak,but only because he was susceptible to her womanly wiles. (Even though, he's doubly culpable by exploiting a patient's vulnerability). He wasn't to blame. But even when Anna was in the bedroom saying how she sometimes wished they were still having an affair, and we were reminded that HE was the cheater in his marriage to Rachel, it was still Anna whose behavior was unpalatable. Tom's never entered my mind as blameworthy. That's why it was surprise when we find out that Tom is the perpetrator of the misery of all 3 women. The writer, and director were relying on this bias to exist in their audience, or it wouldn't have worked at all.

Transitions to scenes that were recollections of past events were handled expertly, and allowed the viewer to be drawn into all of it. Emily Blunt is stellar! The final scenes at Tom and Anna's house, even if one had read the book and knew the outcome, keeps you on the edge of your seat. The location swap from London to New York ends up being insignificant. The characters are familiar, and the location neutral. Great film! Read the book and then go see it.",The Girl on the Train
375,mchughesy,complicated train ride,8,9 October 2016,"The acting in this was brilliant, you really get a good idea as to the mental state of the character and also offers people a understanding of mentally ill people and how they nay act or think.The plot to this film is for me really well done, it took a very long time in getting into the story and in reality could have cut a good 30 minutes out of the film due to this but when it got going it really did keep you guessing as to what was going to happen next.One of my issues with this film is the fact that when it jumps from time to time it can sometimes leave you thinking, is this past or present?, you do figure it out but it can take a minute or 2 for realise what part of the film you are currently watching.overall a very good story, good acting, but it took a little while in getting into the film which I feel was not needed.",The Girl on the Train
376,mystiquem,Toned Gone Girl Feels!,6,17 October 2016,"First, before anything else I want to explicitly mention that Emily Blunt is by now one of the best actresses of our generation. The woman convincingly played an alcoholic, mentally unstable woman while she was 4 months pregnant. And in my opinion she has delivered one of her best roles yet.I was wholly invested and fixated upon her character, which hardly left any attention for the rest of the cast (though, I love Luke Evans).Her versatility as an actress can be compared to the greats like Meryl Streep, Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman and Julie Andrews.I kept theorizing the entire movie about what was happening and what was going to happen. You can't really bank of predictability with this movie (non - book readers) but that's the whole beauty of it.The torture, the tormented silences, the incriminating blackouts, every thing was so engrossing; it kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. Of course, there are times when the pace of the movie hits you but one can't really expect a rushed plot. The movie was an instant reminder of the movie Gone Girl (another movie I love) but minus the extra drama or psychological thriller & gore.",The Girl on the Train
377,benjamintheauthor,Disappointing Hype Train,5,13 September 2017,I gather this was a good read and you can clearly tell the story was written by a woman for women.Why did they decide to let a man helm the directorial seat for this film then? All in all its a mediocre film with a very wasted cast of good actors with a plot twist that you really don't care about or was there two plot twists? I'm not sure if the ending was a plot twist as it was pretty predictable by then. In essence its a movie about women ******** each other over to be with a man and that man is ******** them all over too both figuratively and literally. Its the kind of thing you can find on cinema-screen on daytime TV and is the underlying plot to most bad daytime American soaps.The whole film has that whole 50 shades of grey vibe to it; it will appeal to you if you are a repressed woman frustrated with life or still hate filled due to the umpteenth man who has ****** you over in your life.If you are indeed more of the masculine type then I strongly recommend avoiding this film like the plague as it will bore you to tears.All in all the film does little to alleviate stereotypes about women in the modern world and paints a very dim view of them indeed in this film. Men are of course and always will be bastards so nothing unexpected to discover in this film about men either.,The Girl on the Train

If said viewers then read the novel afterwards however, I suspect they'd be horrified by the lack of stunning designer interiors, gym-honed bodies and perfect teeth.Disappointed in the usually excellent Emily Blunt too (and what is that accent supposed to be?

383,kenny-164,"Acting Great, Writing Not So Much",5,10 January 2018,"This is a film with a fair share of plusses, which I will get to. But it fails, probably from the point the notion of adapting it from a novel arose. The plot line is probably one that can be followed well reading a book, and I did not read this. Perhaps this is a film that virtually requires the viewer to first read the book. No doubt there are many film adaptations of books where we all can say we enjoy both. But that's a different matter than saying, as here, the story simply cannot stand on its as a film. The filmmakers clearly determined their adaptation must follow the narrative at the level of detail it did here, which in a word was substantial. I sense the plot's requirements as such were what led to the often bad dialogue, and the use of plot to establish the characters, which can and often does become inadequate to such end. What may have been a great read when compressed into the film becomes tedious and at times exhausting.To be clear it is not the way such devices as flashbacks and the device of the husband's misrepresenting the blacked out ex-wife's recollections are not the problem so much. On the plus side the film has a great atmosphere to it, with carefully chosen location shoots that all well serve the story's feel. And the cast is near uniformly very good led by the excellent Emily Blunt, who probably deserves two or three of these five stars on her own. It's just not enough.",The Girl on the Train

390,najdzi,Excellent Mystery Drama,8,8 February 2017,"I haven't read the book, and I haven't seen Gone Girl yet (everyone seems to keep comparing this to them), and from that unbiased point of view this movie is excellent.Story is very well written, very interesting, it grips you, and the order and the pace in witch it reveals and paints things to the viewers is near perfect. Don't get me wrong, this movie is very slow, and it takes some patience, intelligence and an interest for psychology to fully enjoy how it is done. Its slow pace does not cater to a casual audience that wants some instant trills. But it still delivers a lot for mind to chew on while watching. Even after the watching. This is why I am writing this review. More on that in the end.Acting is superb, especially from 3 main actresses, but a very solid performance from the male side of the cast and from the episodic rolls. O'd only say Rachel's friend or cousin or sister who ever she is that lives with her in the time of the story is the weakest character, but a very insignificant one at that.Photography is OK, it is solid, and grim atmosphere of the movie is helped with the light chosen for filming. But it is nothing extraordinary, and it didn't tickle my photographic sensibilities. But it didn't hurt the presentation either.Sound is good, voices and dialogues are well intelligible and music is subtle enough, that it helps the atmosphere without the viewer even noticing it.I could say this film is well directed and well cut and there is nothing more to add to that statement.There is ONE THOUGHT this story tickles that is (I think) not even intended by the book writer, or the movie crew. This is the thought that there is something fundamentally wrong with how in these contemporary times both genders look on marriage, sex, family and kids. While superficial look would suggest that this story is about domestic abuse, there is an another very clear picture painted. It is especially well described how 2 very ordinary white privileged women, from England (originally in the book) or from US (in the movie), look at relationships with men, what they want from their husbands and lovers and how they want their life to look. And there is one lost girl, very sexy, lost in a maze of different feeling, and different lovers so much that she is absolutely not in charge of her destiny, I'd say, even before a huge tragedy that shaped her. 3 ordinary contemporary women. And 3 of their ideal men, that not just can't make them happy, but make them tragically incapable of tackling life, and horrendously abuse them to the end.I can tell you I was not surprised this story was originally written by unmarried, childless white woman in her early forties, that after growing up in Zimbabwe came to study in England and attended Oxford.This move will make you think of an alternative view of sex, relationships, marriage, family and kids. Any but this 3 women's view.",The Girl on the Train

395,aliceflupper,Bold. Brutal. Beautiful.,8,14 August 2017,"'The Girl on the Train' is the modern equivalent of a monumental novel. Its simplicity mirrors the simplicity of the modern age. The work-home-sleep pattern reigns the day and there is no place for thought, or foresight in it. The same happens to the characters in the film. Apart from the title girl, the only outcast in a highly organized, civilized society, all the characters are stuck in a vicious circle of work, dubious relationships, and reactionary behaviors. All are dissatisfied in one way, or another, and all cause other people pain although most of the time the hurt is unintentional. Caught in the whirlwind of everyday life, they don't have time to think of their own wants and needs, let alone other people's. Everyone is just too busy and too respectable. 'Respectability' seems to be the key which unlocks the film's themes. Without giving too much away, let me say that the people commanding the most respect and having the most authority end up being the most depraved while the seemingly unreliable ones turn out the most humane. Emily Blunt's stunning, haunting performance turns the film into an experience. Her character's fragmented reality becomes an entrancing journey to watch and once all the pieces fall into place at the end, it feels as if we've discovered a truth, or found an answer to an important question. The ending is not forced. to the contrary, it provides a closure and feels like a relief which, in turn, makes the experience worthwhile. Additionally, the film is effortlessly shot. Contrary to the earlier thriller and horror classics, such as Hitchcock's 'Vertigo,' or 'Psycho,' the combination of close-ups and long shots strikes a balance, so the spectator doesn't feel overwhelmed by the slightly anxiogenic subject 'The Girl on the Train' deals with. The quick pace along with the increasing number of conflicting pieces of evidence keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The use of flashbacks add realism and give insight into Rachel's mind. It's filmmaking at its best. Tate Taylor does not take the possibilities that new technology affords for granted and makes sure he uses them with caution and as a means to an end. The story-telling is pushed to the forefront and the format merely compliments it. Considering that the film is based on a best-selling novel, it can be said that it traces a cultural trend. And if this type of story is celebrated by both readers and spectators then I must say, I'm happy to be living in this day and age.",The Girl on the Train

As the story unfolded I was hooked and like many had suspicions of who the murderer was but kept changing my opinion. At first it seemed like Rachel was going to be arrested for the murder even if she didn't do it. Then other possible suspects unfolded but soon those were found not to be case and at the end it all came together. This held my attention to the end like few films nowadays do and although it had a slow start. But once the girl went missing it picked up and I was hooked.Yeah, not a lot of action and not the best acting I've seen over the years but something about it just grabbed me and kept all my attention for about the last 75%.

399,pha100,"READ THE BOOK FIRST! ""A Knockout Performance""",8,6 November 2016,"""The Girl On The Train"" is a thriller, drama and mystery film that will keep moviegoers on their seats. At the same time, it's best to read the book before watching the movie so that audiences can understand the context of what is going on throughout the film, as it can get confusing and frustrating to keep up with.Rachel Watson (played by Emily Blunt) is a divorcée that becomes entangled in a missing persons investigation that promises to send shock waves throughout her life. Emily Blunt delivers an outstanding performance as a woman who is near the end of her rope and Haley Bennett portrayal as a complex and disturbed fantasy girl proved to be one of her best works, along side with a brilliant cast.It's understandable for viewers to watch this movie while have not read the book and be confused and disappointed with the film. Like I mentioned above, READ THE BOOK FIRST BEFORE YOU WATCH THE FILM. Reading the book will give you more knowledge of the character's background and situation. Paula Hawkins (the author) is very descriptive with the way she expresses the characters in this book emotionally, mentally and physically. Majority of the film is true to the book, but in some cases there were a few parts that were missing such as the part when Scott locks Rachel in a room and she finds evidence that proves that Scott didn't kill his wife. Furthermore, there were a few added scenes that weren't from the book that was in the film which made it a bit more interesting and suspenseful.Although it was anticipating at some points of the film, it could have been better especially with the context of the movie. To sum up, Emily Blunt made a knockout performance and is looking at a Oscar nomination for sure in her portrayal as Rachel. In addition for moviegoers, read the book before so that you know what is going on in the film.FINAL SCORE FOR ""THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN"": 8/10",The Girl on the Train

Traces of Birdman ( I still wish she jumped) And traces of Gone Girl.(minus Ben,minus the story line,) There are only a handful of movies that i wished I had walked out on and this was one of them .Should've snuck out and into another movie.All they did was shag.Not fun watching those scenes with your daughter.Not one of the characters had any endearing qualities There is something wrong with a movie if it doesn't have any characters that you want to like .I kept imagining that all the characters would hold hands and jump in front of the train.This was so tedious to watch .While Emily Blunt played the drunk with conviction it still wasn't pretty to watch.The movie jumped back and forth with no apparent reason other than to throw out the red herrings .It just came across as a bad peep show.

Casting seemed pretty solid on the female side but then they're acting was so below other roles! And then the men... Good looks don't guarantee good acting. Everything about this movie was wrong. Every single monologue I loved in the book was gone or mangled beyond recognition. Every single character reinvented to fit a bland, easily- digestible, Hollywood model. And the story itself... SO MANY unnecessary changes that it feels like they're telling a completely different story. Disappointingly, this is a far inferior story: full of clichés, story-line gaps, predictable twists and flat characters.I stopped watching around 30 min in and walked out at around 45 min.

429,hannah-hastings,What Did She See? I'm Not Too Sure Myself,5,10 October 2016,"The adaptation of the popular thriller novel The Girl on the Train has received a super charged advertising campaign for the past month leading up to its highly anticipated release this weekend from fans and critics a like. Sadly, the 'who dunnit' plot of what Emily Blunt's character Rachel actually sees on her picturesque daily commute into New York does not have a strong enough narration to keep you on the edge of your seat as the trailers and TV spots have seemingly promised. One thing that can be said is that Emily Blunt owns this performance. She pulls off a convincing a disheveled, struggling alcoholic who obsesses over her ex husband's new family which serves as the main motivation as we follow her story of trying to solve the mysterious disappearance of their young next door neighbour. You experience a range of emotions with her character from feeling sorry to slightly disgusted to how she handles a variety of situations. In terms of trying to figure out 'what happened' is kept well under under wrapped until the third act of the film, but reaching that point is paced far too slow with not enough twists and suspension which ultimately drags this films down being its full potential. Also being a viewer who had not read the book beforehand, I cannot say how the closely the film follows the original source material. Now having seen The Girl on the Train I can certainly imagine this story being more effective in print with the points of views and personalities of other the characters being much more developed rather than a visual piece, which overall left me confused and longing for the film get back on track.",The Girl on the Train

Blunt gives here the show of her life, way above the level of acting in ""edge of tomorrow"". The story itself takes time to build but it all adds to the atmosphere, and finally you get a fair amounts of twists and turns. Bennett and Ferguson also acting very well, which all adds (to my opinion) to a great film. And to all the men that say it's a ""men hating"" film, I say that you really have a low self-confidence to come up with such a statement... I would risk to say it's one of my 2016 best films, and I will be surprised if Blunt will not be an Oscar nominee for this film.",The Girl on the Train
431,Libby628,"Not Bad, Not Outstanding",7,6 October 2016,"I saw Girl on the Train at an advanced screening in Atlanta. I had read the book and enjoyed it, despite feeling like it had some flaws.The plot of the movie followed the book very closely, which I appreciated. The movie opens on Rachel and then title cards show us the perspectives of Megan and Anna shortly after. Rachel is a drunk, divorced, unemployed woman who becomes infatuated with the ""perfect life"" of Megan and her husband who she see's everyday on her commute to New York on the train. Rachel's train route also passes her ex-husband Tom and his new wife Anna, who he cheated on Rachel with several years ago. All of these worlds collide when Rachel see's Megan in the arms of another man on morning on the train and then, after getting drunk and blacking out in Megan's neighborhood, Megan goes missing.The casting of this movie was hit and miss to me. As the character of Megan was described as overweight and not particularly attractive, I found Emily Blunt to be an odd and ""Hollywood"" choice. Despite never truly looking the part (she had great hair throughout the film and looked largely the same as her sober flashbacks), Emily Blunt played one of the more convincing versions of a messed up character I have seen in a while. She does great throughout the movie playing someone who you really feel both sorry for and frustrated with at the same time. I was happily surprised to hear her voice for the first time on the train speaking to the woman who sat next to her, which clearly showed the audience that she was completely drunk without any voice over to assist with the set up. Emily Blunt was putting in her best effort here and showed more range than what we have seen from her in the past.I didn't feel that anyone else particularly stood out in the rest of the cast. Haley Bennett is striking as Megan, but as the person that we are supposed to eventually connect with on an emotional level, I had a hard time not seeing her as anything but cold and pretty. It doesn't help that she looks so much like January Jones and acted pretty much exactly like Betty from Mad Men. I thought that Rebecca Ferguson fit the Anna role well but never got the opportunity to do much in the movie. It definitely seemed that her character had more to say in the book and the ending of the movie gives so much less insight into what kind of person Anna is. I had the highest hopes for Justin Theroux as this movie offered a different character for him to play. But again, I didn't believe that he left that much of an impression. I do not fault the actors or writers exclusively for this, I think that these characters were difficult to relate to as they were all selfish and self serving. The writing never transcends this to offer us anyone to root for though.The supporting cast fairs much better. Alison Janney gives a solid performance as usual as the detective on the case. Lisa Kudrow, in only two scenes, comes across as a much more real person than most of the cast and offers the biggest revelation to our main character. Laura Prepon is wasted here as Rachel's roommate in such a tiny role but still gives more of a presence than most of our main cast.The movie juggles different perspectives of these characters in a sometimes interesting, sometimes awkward way, jumping between different perspectives, flashbacks and cloudy moments when Rachel is drunk. This movie was not easy to edit but I felt that the filmmakers did a good job keeping the film moving and clarifying flashbacks that took place earlier.I never felt that the ending of the book had a great punch to it and the movie is the same. This is the one area that I wish the movie had added something. After we find out who the antagonist is, the ending fizzles out and the last few scenes are pretty lackluster in comparison to what the movie's plot seems to promise. That said, the film makers did a solid job of telling this story. This is not a bad movie at all, just nothing that I will remember for a long time. It felt like it could have premiered on Lifetime, which I do not mean as a huge insult. An average movie. Not bad but definitely not outstanding.",The Girl on the Train

434,leonardo-beltrame,Insipid,5,10 October 2017,"Based on Paula Hawkins' bestseller, ""The Girl on the Train"" tells the story of three women whose paths get intertwined by the disappearance of one of them. In the process, the movie flirts with interesting themes, such as alcoholism, marriage, and memories.First, I need to let something clear. Even though the book was highly praised and was considered by many people a terrific thriller, I found it rather weak. We notice from the very beginning that we're experiencing a whodunit story. However, the resolution of the mystery is utterly frustrating, since it is predictable and it is revealed too soon. There's a bigger problem, though: the storytelling is very problematic. We never get the sense that the story is naturally unfolding - things just happen out of the blue. What's more, the characters are, at the very best, uninteresting. Some of them are even inexplicably abandoned in the middle of the narrative. Well, since the source is that weak, it is difficult to imagine the book to be different.Director Tate Taylor doesn't ruin the movie but nevertheless takes some weird choices when it comes to camera-work. Some low-frame sequences are annoying, the different time-lines and perspectives are unnecessarily convoluted, and the rhythm is monotonous.The screenplay manages to worsen the already feeble story came from the book. Characters that were ""only"" uninteresting got completely one-dimensional. Not to mention the useless ones, such as the detectives, doctor Kamal Abdic, and the red-haired guy from the train (really, why on earth is he there?). The dialogues are poor and there seems to be a complete absence of connection between some scenes. Moreover, motivations are incomprehensible, which prevents the public from being invested in the story.Emily Blunt as Rachel gives a far better performance than the movie asks. Haley Bennett (Megan) and Rebecca Ferguson (Anna), although not that good, both are OK. Justin Theroux has the strongest performance among the men, which isn't saying much.The cinematography is pretty decent and the soundtrack, albeit not memorable, is very suitable. ""The Girl on the Train"" reflects many of the weakness of Paula Hawkins' book. More the that, it manages to be even worse. Vote: 5,8.",The Girl on the Train
435,johanna-81800,Did they edit it?,6,16 October 2016,"Seriously, they could have cut about 3/5 of the movie, most of the flashbacks were boring and did nothing for the plot, I suppose they were trying to have the audience connect with the characters but it did not work, i felt 0 emotional (or any other) connection with any of the characters except Rachel (Emily Blunt), she was the only interesting character. The other woman Anna held my interest for about thirty seconds, in the end. Maybe it was the filming but every other character was boring and un-relatable. But by far the worst part of this movie (IMO) was the filming, there were some nice landscapes but every interaction between the characters seemed like they were trying to make it seem like we were looking at it though a haze of alcohol, and personally it annoyed me a lot. Honestly, the movie was just too long...with too many confusing flashback were you're siting there thinking ""when did this happen? what's it got to do with the rest of the plot?"".Had it been about an hour shorter it would've made a much better movie.

And the way in which they allowed the sequences of the flashbacks to unfold before it, at times could have been a tad confusing, but I was drawn into the plot enough to follow what was happening.

437,bigbeatrocks,Depraved Pagan Soap Opera,1,29 December 2016,"I hated this film so much that it almost ruined my Christmas holiday. I said ALMOST. Heh.Boring, cheap, sleazy, soulless, perverse, confused, senseless and well, evil, are the words which come to mind when I think of this film. Not too far along in the story I had the strong feeling that I should get up and leave before it damaged my soul(!), but I'm a very curious person- the type who likes to see how everything turns out, so I almost always stay til the credits roll (or beyond). If a film seems bad or uninteresting, I usually think, ""It may get better"". As the story developed, though, I began to feel more and more uncomfortable. I was revulsed by some of the scenes and by what impressed me as being some of the underlying concepts of the film. The dismay must have shown on my face because a woman sitting nearby laughed as I reacted to a few scenes. Believe me, those scenes were not humorous. Still I waited, hoping for something good; but the film never got better. In fact it got worse. It actually picked up steam as it went along, becoming more and more disgusting as it went.I'm sorry, but I can't comment on the conclusion. I left just before the (apparent) end of the last scene. I just couldn't take anymore.Walking out of the theater I felt somewhat embarrassed and dirty, as if I'd partaken of some moral corruption. I should have walked out when my conscience told me to: in the early stages of the film. Next time.",The Girl on the Train
438,Trilliumviews,Riveted to my seat- but in a bad way,1,12 November 2016,"There are some interesting character studies in this movie for both the female and male actors. They are not sketchy or superficial, however, the emphasis on darkness, unsettling uncertainty and scattered violence left me somewhat jarred and frozen in my seat. The disturbing danger and violence creeps up on you in almost unremarkable ways, so many times, unsure which turn the film would take- will we see evil or kindness, understanding or condemnation?, I was left hanging in until leaving, which would have been the sane thing to, was no longer an option because I felt so shaky. Unless your lifestyle has desensitized you to covert cruelty, deception, and violence - stay at home. At least I learned and vowed never again to ""sit and see"" when a film is too emotionally jarring for me.

449,fairytail-04871,The anti-feminist hate is strong with this one,6,20 May 2021,"I just watched this movie and will have to admit that the screenplay was just average. The pacing was a bit slow and it was not that hard to guess who was really responsible for the tragedy, so don't expect a true mystery. Character development was also lackluster and barely has enough depth to form an attachment with a character (unless you're an alcoholic too). I'll also have to admit that the entire backstory is quite unrealistic assuming that it takes place in the modern world. Typical suburban families are the more ""casual"" type, but this story paints it as if the man in the family works for a mafia. Overall, there just was not enough substance to have any sort of meaningful lasting impression. However, it was watchable and I found the story to be compelling enough.So while I do think this movie is far from being a masterpiece, it's quite ridiculous to hate on it just because you personally interpret it as having a
""feminist agenda"" of some sort. If that is the only message you've got from the movie, then it's sad to say that you're merely judging the movie from your own misguided belief that ""male antagonism = bad"", and not from the actual reasons of why it's bad.",The Girl on the Train

Emily Blount did a great job acting the part. That girl has refined her skills. The writer did an adequate job of developing the main characters. The movie was a typical look into a different demographic and lifestyle that makes you want to keep your distance from such characters.

We are not prudes, but the book was not laced with all the F and F and Fs. It (gratuitous foul language) is getting old, Hollywood, and a sign of people with poor writing skills - not the author, the screen writers and producers that think profanity is in everyone's everyday conversation. Here's news, kids, it is not. Not real grown ups in any case. Otherwise we thought it was a really good adaptation albeit ruined for us. If you use 4-letter words in every sentence, you will love this.We also note more graphic sex than the novel. We can live with that as the producers think it is necessary to drive the ratings down to draw more audiences. It could have been worse, but most gratuitous sex scenes were done rather well and discrete by Hollywood standards. We both thought Emily was great and that she will probably get some deserved award nominations here.

459,josephine-puls,Disappointment,5,31 October 2016,"First off, I want to mention that I have read the book and my judgment is therefore partly based on this.The girl on the train is a psychological thriller based on a novel written by Paula Hawkins. It is centered around Rachel Watson, a 32-year old alcoholic, who was left by her husband, Tom Watson two years ago, who then married Anna Watson. Rachels drinking problems led her to lose her job and made her an unhappy, unbalanced, isolated and unfriendly person. So when she gets hold of information about the disappearance of Megan Hipwell, no one really believes her - at times she doe not even believe herself. And suddenly, she is the one being accused of her murder. But who can she trust, if she can't even trust herself - or can she?The movie/book is told from three perspectives: Rachel, Anna and Megans, and deals with both the present and the past (before the disappearance of Megan). This works brilliantly in the book, as this allows the reader to get to know all of the characters, as well as it confuses the reader even further about who the killer is - leaves us guessing. But, in the movie, handling so many different story lines actually does the exact opposite and results in us not getting a full understanding of any off the characters - maybe apart from Megan. Furthermore major characters in the book, such as Annas or Kamals, do almost not play a role in the movie. In other words: in the movie some of the actions of the characters seem unreasonable as we do not know the whole story behind them, especially the final scene, where Anna ... - you will get the point when you see the movie.Emily Blunt portrays Rachels character very well, but apart from her none of the other performances are really worth a mention.All-in-all its a standard thriller/drama, with fine acting and a good story-line (that in my opinion has been done wrong by a bad playbook and a even worse direction), but it is not really more than that.

461,thompd59,A decent film - and Emily Blunt is terrific.,8,9 October 2016,"Emily Blunt gives a fine performance as Rachel Watson, a troubled, alcoholic divorcée who commutes to Manhattan daily by train. The journey takes her past what was once her home - in which her ex-husband, Tom, still lives, with his new wife Anna and their baby. Trying to block out the daily images of her old house and Tom's new family, Rachel instead fantasises about the relationship of their neighbours, Scott and Megan. The plot centres around the sudden disappearance of Megan - an event for which Rachel herself may have been responsible.The film opens with a series of first person narratives from the three leading female characters (though the film title serves to remind us around whom the story will revolve)and, throughout, there are numerous 'flash-backs'. This device can be confusing - even annoying - without some context for the viewer, either before or shortly afterwards, and in a few cases here it is some time before that context is forthcoming. At some point though, one becomes acutely aware that the first half of the film was simply setting the scene, giving the viewer some insight into relevant back-stories, and the remainder promises to be a Hitchcock- style psychological thriller, in which we try to work out what has happened - and why. Any comparison to Hitchcock would imply a twist and I don't think it is giving anything away to say that there is indeed a twist in this dark tale. Verdict: A slow-burner initially, but well worth hanging in there. The promise of a tense (sometimes very violent) thriller is delivered once the pace of the narrative begins to quicken.",The Girl on the Train

463,juliet-67159,Great adaptation though the transfer to the USA is somewhat creaky,7,11 October 2016,"I have not read the book but I have listened to it on audio, a very good audio with several narrators playing the main characters. I was a bit jarred when I saw the train cruising past these large posh Americanhouses when in the original it is clearly those Victorian terraces you see coming into London. It's not that it loses it all by the transatlantic setting it is just very different in style, bigger, plusher more moneyed.If I had a choice I would have preferred a UK setting, dingy old train lukewarm wine from Whistlestop. I am wondering if I came to this cold, I think I might find it a little hard to follow working out who is who and who is or was, married to whom. In the book Rachel can get a good look into passing houses because as we Brits have experienced the train stops for quite a while at signals outside London the US transfer has the train sweeping past so that bit is implausible. Emily Blunt is superb and acts everyone else off the screen she plays a sad, hurt, lonely drunk to heartbreaking perfection. Don't want to give spoilers so can't say to much about the story, but the fact that this novel is condensed to make a film leaves the plot somewhat thin. The male characters are samey and one dimensional. It is shot with a lot of style and panache though and I have no hesitation in recommending it whether or not you have read the book",The Girl on the Train

Thriller? could we really call it that? Possibly, only due to the cause of Megan's disappearance, in this 'could have been better if.."" of a movie. All the supporting actors did their part in fulfilling their roles, but the main person audiences had any idea about was our main character Rachel played by Emily Blunt and Megan played by Haley Bennett. Solid performances across the board from all on this project, but maybe this film adaptation missed its mark. Gave me pause to actually go and read the book, since you leave with a weird aftertaste of what you were put through. At least the book will have direction and more content all around.

467,cschroeder-94453,Book vs Movie,8,15 October 2016,"The Girl on the TrainHaving not enjoyed the book, I had low expectations of the movie. In the book, I found Rachel to be tiresome and I did not feel sympathetic toward her. The movie opened my eyes to seeing her differently. More on that later.First, a few faults in the movie. It might have been harder to understand if you hadn't read the book. I thought that having read the book, it helped me understand the internal dialogues of the women. I knew a lot more about the characters and therefore their actions were more meaningful.They made a few changes in the movie that seemed unnecessary. They changed the location from London to NYC. More importantly, I didn't understand why they changed the details of how Megan's baby died. It was a life-changing tragedy either way, but seemed like an unnecessary change.Now, let's look at some things they got right. The psychiatrist was presented the right amount in the movie. The book had more about the psychiatrist and it would not have added to the movie and it would have been confusing. His role was to bring out the back stories in Megan and Rachel and it worked perfectly. Megan's husband, Scott, was also just right. He was myopic and had believable intensity, which was essential. Tom, Rachel's former husband was also written and played just right. His handsome, but misogynistic character dupes you into believing that he has some sympathy for Rachel and then deals a hammer blow when you see him for who he really is. The acting and directing of this role created much more nuance in the character as opposed to the book, where I suspected him from the beginning.But the single most important line that changed my entire outlook comes at the very beginning of the movie. Anna said ""Rachel was right all along."" It made me realize how quickly we write-off people whose behavior is offensive, as was the case with Rachel's constant drunkenness, and then we discount everything they say and do. Rachel was not credible, and wasn't taken seriously, by Anna or the police. It turned out that Rachel really did just want to help. She wanted to find some place for herself. She was really a good person who had been emotionally abused and became an addict. Emily Blunt, excellent in the movie as Rachel, gave me the perspective to more fully appreciate the character of Rachel.The envy that she had for Anna and Megan was no different than we all might have when we see what looks like a perfect life. But, shown through the lens of an alcohol infused, dysfunctional woman, it looks like lustful envy of someone wanting to harm the more fortunate person. She was flawed, she was damaged, she was unreliable, but she really wanted to help.When I finished the book, I didn't think that Rachel's motivations were genuine. I thought they were fueled by jealousy, I thought it was because she wanted Megan's life (which she did). I had the same perspective as Anna, who was scared and ignorant as to who Rachel was.When I left the movie, I felt like the scene at the end of the movie when Anna said Rachel was right all along, was the truth. It was all a matter of unreliable perspective.",The Girl on the Train
468,justin_h_carter,"Man-hating, depressing, and awful",1,24 October 2016,"Should movie be titled ""Drunk Girl on the Train"".This movie is so man-hating only the most fanatic SJW could love it.It is so depressing you might need meds afterwards. The characters are profoundly unsympathetic and miserable to watch.Drunk Girl's plot is so full of holes it is laughably unbelievable. The movie can't seem to decide if it is in NY or the UK which only adds to the confusion. Rachel, the supposed hero of this movie is an alcoholic stalker who downs hard liquor all day while stalking people from her old neighborhood (her fav is stalking the neighborhood from the train). She calls her ex-husband's home constantly at all hours... but none of her victims seem to ever think to change their phone number or even block the calls? Rachel drops in uninvited to her ex's home from time to time and kidnaps a child from her ex's new marriage which the police are aware of this but Rachel is somehow still walking around a free woman? On top of that no one seems to even think about getting a restraining order against Rachel??? Her ex is a psychopathic murderer but somehow lets all this behavior slide? And then the ex-husband murders a neighbor nympho girl (a girl who abhors the thought of having kids) because the nympho girl is pregnant and wants to keep the baby (who truly could have been anyone's)?

469,autumnperron,Not entirely bad but nothing special,4,8 January 2017,"First review on here, sorry if it sucks...This movie was decent but it wasn't anything I feel the need to see again. It's certainly one of those movies that adds too many unnecessary sex scenes and I got annoyed with that very quickly. Emily Blunt's acting was decent and she was the best part of the movie for me. (Sidenote: I thought Megan was played by Jennifer Lawrence for most of the movie. They look a lot alike!) About halfway through it I figured out who the killer was because there was very few characters, it just made the most sense it was Rachel's ex-husband. I think the way they show the timeline does make this more confusing and interesting so it isn't super obvious. I also think the final scene was well done.",The Girl on the Train

471,Matthew_530,This guy won't be riding on the hate train,9,15 October 2016,"It is rare to stumble along films that resonate with you way after the fact, but this is the case for me with ""The Girl on the Train"". I'll admit, I read the book twice, but to see all the reviews from others claiming there is no tension and/or suspense makes me fear that slower paced dramas have lost their fitting in today's big thrills, big guns & big explosion blockbusters that the public has come to expect from the ever magical Hollywood.I'll begin with the plot. I was truly captivated by the characters of Megan & Rachel, even while reading the novel, mostly because it is very easy to connect with characters in their lowest moments. Rachel, being an alcoholic who finds herself bloody and dishevelled one morning on her apartment floor after drinking way too much, even for her, fears for the worst. Having known she was in the area where young Megan disappeared, could she somehow be involved while in her drunken angry state? The mystery was well portrayed in both the novel and the film. I found myself shifting in my seat frequently throughout - even though I knew the outcome. The story-line keeps you guessing, and brilliantly sways the audience to believe Rachel could possibly be the culprit. We get the behind the scenes look from multiple angles with each character. Much like a jury sitting on the case, we follow Rachel, Megan & Anna to frame up our own perspective on the happening's of July 13th.I don't think I could say anything to give the performances the praise they deserve. The acting was simply A+ material. Emily Blunt carries the dark spirit from beginning to end, and her monologues deserved a standing O. All in all, I can't wait for my return trip to this fantastic story. Better lay off the booze for this ride though, because it's as twisty as they come!",The Girl on the Train

479,mwmcintire,Emily Blunt Astounds,9,15 October 2016,"Not having read the book, I entered the film knowing very little about the story. I am an unapologetic fan of Emily Blunt and found this performance to be among her best. She embodied her character with authenticity, bravery, and truth. I will view this film again just to watch her performance.I gave the film a high score based on the above as well as its superb direction and cinematography. Tate Taylor, the director told a compelling human drama without sinking too deeply into the whodunit question. Taylor discovered depth for the fine cast which might have been lost if the mystery angle had been overplayed. Chinatown is another film with a mystery providing the incentive for the characters to be on screen; however, in the end it's the characters who are on display beyond their role in the crime.Charlotte Bruus Christensen, DP filmed her characters and the venue with care, insight, and love. The Hudson river provides beauty and grace while we watch the unraveling of striking characters as the train moves through the story. It was a challenge to distinguish between two actors who look enough alike on screen; however, Ms. Christensen did an excellent job with her lens for the wonderful Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson.",The Girl on the Train
480,boomuk,One train worth missing.,3,5 February 2017,"Trains. There used to be something quite romantic about travelling on them. Sitting by the window, with a hot beverage in hand, watching the world sweep past you. You can still do that now of course, but you have to put up with a person next to you talking ear-piercingly loud on their phone; the person opposite falling asleep into a greasy kebab; the person next to them who just stares - at you; and getting a seat next to the loos that are leaking unpleasant smells. And that's if you can get a seat at all with everyone squished in overcrowded carriages like angry sardines.British author Paula Hawkins has obviously been stuck on the odd commuter train or two, as she wrote the best-selling The Girl on the Train - which also happened to be the most borrowed book from UK libraries in 2016, fact fans. With that kind of success it was only a matter of time, and a huge carriage full of cash, for Hollywood to turn it into a film. Like most people, Rachel (Emily Blunt) spends a lot of time commuting into the city. During the journey she stares out of the window, but instead of taking in the views, she's fixated with one house and the couple who live within its walls. It's not quite as creepy as it sounds; she used to live in the house next door with her husband Tom (Justin Theroux) until their divorce. He still lives there, with a new woman in his life, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson), and their new-born baby. Rachel is still struggling with their break-up, and continues her on-going relationship with alcohol to help ease the pain. Her drinking also leads to her turning up on her ex-husband's doorstep, and phoning constantly, which is not appreciated by the couple. Looking out of the train window on a daily basis, at the life she used to have and should still have, she notices Tom's neighbour Megan (Haley Bennett) and her husband Scott (Luke Evans). They appear to have the perfect relationship, fuelled by an abundance of love and passion. But when Rachel catches her in the arms of another man from her train window, she realises that everything isn't quite as it seemed. This notion is confirmed when Megan mysteriously disappears; unfortunately, due to her meddling in her ex-husband's affairs and regularly turning up on his doorstep in an inebriated state, Rachel finds herself in the middle of the investigation. To make matters worse, she has no memory of events, so isn't sure if she's involved or not. Could she really have had something to do with Megan's disappearance?Director Tate Taylor begins this journey by creating a modern day film noir feeling; his protagonist finds herself in a scenario that she is struggling to remember, and through the use of flashbacks, a picture is slowly revealed as to what actually happened. It's a solid device for a film of this ilk, however Taylor lacks the skills necessary to pull it off with any competency. With a whodunit, it's usually customary to have a big reveal at the end. Unfortunately, due to the limited number of characters in the story, audiences will know long before then; you don't need to be Sherlock (or even Mrs Hudson for that matter) to work it out, and once you have, it sucks out all the thrills the film blindly attempts to include in its second half. Even if you don't - you will, but for argument's sake go with it anyway - Taylor's approach feels dated, with the drama, and it has to be said a lot of the acting, turned up all the way to eleven, unnecessarily. So much so that in places it feels more like a parody of a drama than anything else. Its one saving grace though is Blunt and it's easy to understand why she took the gig; she manages to get right under the skin of the character, and bring all her faults into the light. Rachel is flawed and Blunt tunes in to each and every one of them with pure skill. It also has strong female performances throughout, which can only be a good thing. It's a shame then that the film puffs out its chest in a failed attempt to impress, delivering the cinematic equivalent of hot air. At some point, with its journey from the page to the screen, this project went seriously off the rails and ultimately isn't worth catching.",The Girl on the Train

It's just flat ending and you want to go home, you don't even want to think about any scene from the movie.The acting is the only key that saves this movie from a complete disaster.

At times it honestly felt as though the actors were reading lines from the book off of big white cue cards behind the camera. It was comical really... Don't even get me started on the sexual scenes. They were so poorly done, it made many people including myself laugh aloud in the theater. No attachment to any of the characters, and no development whatsoever. Really bad...

But the beauty of this movie relies on the progression of what happens, at first the movie might seem a little bit slow, but when the first couple things are revealed, things don't stop happening ever, till almost the last scene, and there is a certain kind of cool thing about the wrongest person being the one that was right all along.

485,cttinkerbell6,So much potential and yet...what did I just watch,3,27 January 2017,"My three stars go solely to Emily Blunt who plays the character Rachel. She is the only character who was actually developed with any insight at all and I contribute that to Blunt's acting skills! As for the other characters and plot itself...yeesh. I read the book before the film, big mistake!! HUGE!! The book is written so well and the plot twist of Tom being Megan's lover was so blindsiding. The film made it obvious from the opening scene.Also I found that certain traits were either under or over-developed within the characters. Rachel's drinking was glamorised by the odd cocktail she sipped on at a bar, where as in the novel she is an actual addict. She wakes up hungover, she experiences withdrawal. You gain an understanding for the disease of addiction that this film skirted over.Tom was too dominating as a character. Good actor, crappy portrayal. Tom is depicted as kind and lovely in the novel and especially kind and lovely to Rachel even though Anna hates her. Yet in the movie... Speaking of Anna, where did her backbone go? Her character is far prouder and happier than this woman on the screen. While she is suspicious and neurotic where Rachel is concerned, she also adores Tom and yet that connection didn't seem there. Megan also disappointed me. In the novel she is very, very complicated. She loves Scott but is weary of his jealousy and his desire to have a child. Thus driving her to an affair. She is terrible but you connect with her nonetheless because there is something so endearing about her tough brokenness...and yet in the film I didn't really care that she died. I mean it was sad but I didn't connect with her, she was so cold, I wanted to connect, to understand her but I just couldn't. Don't even get me started on Cathy, not enough energy or time to waste on such a poor portrayal of a character.On to the plot. It was so very inconsistent! I do understand why- because the novel deals with the thoughts of Anna, Megan and Rachel, so I see how it would be hard to visualise such thoughts and I appreciate how they used an AA meeting to explain some of the memories Rachel had, but so many important details were ignored. If Harry Potter can successfully be made into a film , why is it that a thriller with fewer details cannot??Since when does Rachel draw? and what purpose did it play? Scott's freak out was so subdued because he and Rachel never slept together and he always seemed on edge already so whats a new little expression of his anger? ALSO WHY IS KAMAHL WHITE???? WHY? He was meant to be the most attractive and exotic character in the film. He was described as beautiful multiple times by both Megan and Rachel! Why was I given a white dude with a crappy Spanish accent??? That was reason enough to deduct a star.It feels like they skirted over so much. Honestly it's like seeing a kid try to colour in a picture: all the colours are there and you can see the picture itself, but everything is just not quite in the right place and the colours aren't always in the lines. Im disappointed. Do yourself a favour, read the book. I read it knowing who the killer was and I didn't feel like the story was ruined. DO yourself a favour and get to know the actual characters because they are so well developed.

As struggling alcoholic Rachel rides aimlessly on her Manhattan bound train, she passes by the same homes and stares woefully at the lives she imagines the inhabitants must lead. One of those homes is the one she once shared with her ex husband, who left her due to her drinking. Inhabited by his pretty new wife and their baby, Rachel can't help but feel envious of the life that could have been hers. The other is shared by a young couple who she imagines have the perfect love. There's a sad longing as she watches from behind the glass, eyes red and glassy from the previous nights binge. She lives through these strangers, having given up on her own life as she drinks from a water bottle concealing vodka on her way to a job she lost a long time ago. Rachel views from a distance - and that distance conceals the cracks, blurring the hidden realities of the lives she covets. Her ex husband is cheating on his new wife, as he did to her. The perfect young couple aren't as perfect as it would appear, their relationship riddled with secrets and despair. Rachel yearns for the husband and the life she once had - but was that life as good as she remembers? Are her memories tainted by the alcohol? Emily Blunt is flawless as the downtrodden, regretful alcoholic who has lost her life and her dignity. Always drunk and muddled in her thoughts, it's hard to distinguish between fact and drunken fantasy. She's a passenger on the train just as she is in her own life - can she eventually take control of the journey or is she doomed to ride out her life in a booze-fueled blur? As she gets closer to the people she once viewed from a distance, Rachel manages to get a grip on reality for long enough to unravel the mysteries of their lives - and her own.",The Girl on the Train

All of these things make anyone jumps the conclusion that creators were so lost and they don't know where to steer the story.All the characters are super flat, tediously static with no slight progression in any way and some characters' existence was useless such as the Shrink ""Dr. Kamal Abdic"" who was pushed into the film just to distract you from the plot in a very obvious way and to emphasize Megan's ""Haley Bennett"" character as most of her scenes was just talking about herself in the therapy sessions.The Direction was a bit of a cliché with all the close shots on the protagonist, the cross cuts between the characters to create a state of distraction to the audience, the mediocre color pallet and lighting, besides the bad acting from mostly all the cast as in Emily Blunt's quite disappointing performance giving us a stereotype model of the wobbling drunk person.To sum up, the movie is a very poor, full of flaws and totally a waste of time.",The Girl on the Train

I was so excited to see this. The two-star rating is thanks to that anticipation; the reality is that the complex scenario of the book has been further twisted for no discernible reason, the characters divested of all appeal and at least half of the dialogue has been limited to some variation of the F word. The mystery and human interest is gone and what's left is just ugly.",The Girl on the Train

It's about a woman who takes the train everyday to go to work. In the train she can see the landscape and starts to think about the life of the people she sees. She sees her past her in a girl and then this girl turns up missing. I think it's a great movie, I love it. It's similar to the movie Lost, which I love it too. It has mystery, drama and a very good performance from all the actors.

I paid my money and was not disappointed, Emily Blunt's performance was outstanding and the chauvinistic husband was like every successful male that seems to be in our society right now. I really felt and understood what Rachel was going through how manipulated she was and how her life crumbled, Meghan and how she used her looks and attributes and how she saw the only way for her also to be successful was to blackmail him and Anna hoping he had changed, and they never do scenario being played out and eventually realizing Rachel was not the problem, and feeling for her.I am glad I went to watch the film and hopefully many more will get to watch it.",The Girl on the Train

The characters, besides Rachel, aren't at all likable and this is not a bad thing, until the end, you won't get to see everyone's true colors. Every actor is correct in their role but is Emily Blunt who delivers the best performance of the film, and for what I've seen of hers, this could be one of her most interesting roles so far. I have to admit that there is quite a plot-hole on the film, but it is a very ""technical"" one and it shouldn't ruin the film for anyone.I've seen some people accusing this film of men-hating, well, all I can say, as a man myself, is that only the most sensitive of rednecks would do such a remark.Overall, don't let the bad reviews push you away from watching the film, give it a chance.

500,damionwright,A nail biting thriller with an excellent dramatization of domestic abuse,8,11 October 2016,"A gripping thriller that depicts the effects of a mysterious encounter viewed from a train window as it passes a house in the burbs of upstate New York. The movie uses similar focalization techniques that Atonement used in 2009, as the significance of a character's perspective drives the story amongst the three female leads. However, our protagonist is the alcoholic and heartbroken, Rachel, who tells us with regret and disdain about losing her husband, her job, and life in the burbs, which we're lead to believe is because of her alcohol problem. She catches the train daily and sketches in her notebook while taking swigs from her apparent water bottle - which is actually full of liquor. Then she explains her obsession with a couple in the house the train passes daily, as they represent the life that was stolen from her and apparently destroyed. But one day her imaginary life of the couple falls apart when it appears she witnesses the women of her fantasies kissing a man other than her husband, which is her nightmare. This sets up a chain of events that results in a missing women mystery and the search to find out what happen in a moment when Rachel had blacked out due to her copious alcohol consumption, something we find out has happened regularly in the past. The movie has no other contextual relations with Atonement, which is a period piece set amongst the backdrop of World War Two, class and social justice. However, The Girl On The Train is a part of a new subculture of female dominated thriller/whodunit films. Other examples include Gone Girl (2014) and Dark Places (2015), both subsequently penned by Gillian Anderson.There appears to be a great deal of attention among critics about the choice by the filmmakers to move the setting of the film from London, where it was set in the book, and to move it to upstate New York and Manhatten. While they still cast Emily Blunt as the lead role, Rachel, who has a thick English accent and doesn't make any attempts to hide it. However, this attention is frivolous and pointless as the locations chosen for the film are perfect as they set an eerie and mysterious tone, that's harsh and unforgiving, as the violence often occurs outside, compared to the interiors which are soft, elegant and warming - a stark reminder of the need for the audience to be set apart from some particularly intense and gruesome violence that does in fact occur.What sets this movie apart from many other thrillers that explore similar themes of adultery, sex, relationships, lust, and conceiving is this movie explores the very nature of psychological and physical abuse in relationships. We're privy to the inner workings of a villain who's reprehensible abusive nature has such shattering and devastating effects on its victims, we are quickly introduced into this world and the nature of abuse that is somewhat confronting. Others may be able to glide through the references of abuse without blinking an eye, it may even fly over their heads - which it did when I read the book the movie is based on. Not every audience member can say they've experienced emotional abuse from a lover and when it's thrust upon you after having dealt with abuse in the past you're quickly reminded of the struggle, the fear, the confusion, the guilt, the blaming and deceit that comes with being abused and these can be overwhelming and be confronting to see.Yet, to have a film that honestly portrays this part of our existence, to be reminded that people are like this, or trapped by this, or have even escaped from this, we can accept that this film is enlightening others to the world of domestic violence, psychological abuse, and physical abuse. To awaken people to the effects these horrific themes in a film that has only just hit mainstream society, then surely we can look past the location of the film being set in New York rather than London, and let use not forget that Emily Blunt, does, in fact, have a deep British accent. I assure you, by the end of the film you won't care about her accent or where the film is set but be enlightened on just what other uses, apart from a wine bottle, one could have for a corkscrew.",The Girl on the Train

The good news is that that last quarter of the movie is enjoyable, the bad news is that you have to sit through the really slow first 3/4's.The movie is full with forced dialogues, has very little suspense and minimal character development.

I don't feel that the pure emotion, character development and tense nature of this story were articulated as well as they could have been in the film. This may have been merely because these things are easier to convey by written word. However, I did enjoy the film: the acting was convincing, the tale was well told and I am sure everyone who hadn't read the book was very impressed. It was unfortunate that it was relocated from London to New York, as I do think it would have been better set where the writer had originally imagined it.",The Girl on the Train

504,payorwait,Good movie but could been Great!,7,5 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train is one of this year's most highly anticipated films, especially after the blockbuster hit of Gone Girl in 2014. In this film, instead of a beautiful yet crazy married woman, we find Rachel (Emily Blunt), who is a divorced woman who has decided to cope with life by abusing alcohol. She rides the train every day while sipping her occasional vodka or wine while she stalks a beautiful woman living in the suburbs called Megan (Haley Bennett). The train passes by Megan's house and each day Rachel falls deeper into her new reality of Megan's life which is the life Rachel wants back.Emily Blunt is absolutely brilliant in this film as a depressed and obviously crazy divorced alcoholic. She is so good, I felt very uncomfortable watching her downfall as a drunk in her scenes. She is barely holding on to reality after her divorce from her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) which only encourages her drinking even more. It seems her alcoholism had a role to play in the downfall of not only her life but her marriage as well. She has resorted to stalking her ex and his new wife Anna (Rachel Ferguson) during her drunken episodes. While Tom is not innocent at all in this situation you have wonder how can someone like Rachel continue to spiral out of control daily with no additional consequences. During the entire film, I was wondering where are her friends and family to hold an intervention and save her? During the film, Rachel has another drunken episode in which she drinks so much that she blacks out. She only remembers she wanted to go confront Megan about something she sees while she is on the train, which I won't spoil for you. The next day Rachel wakes up and realizes that not only has Megan gone missing but she does not know if she has had anything to do with her disappearance. Against any sane person's judgment, she decides to try to solve the mystery of Megan's disappearance, which turns to murder when her body is found and Rachel is one of the suspects. The movie then takes you on a roller-coaster ride of twists and turns and manages to reveal some shocking secrets.Overall, this was a good film but it could have been even better. The movie is a little slow in the beginning but towards the end, it turns up 10 notches. The casting for this film was great and but no one can match Emily Blunt's performance and that's OK with me. I will definitely say PAY to see this film in theaters. I know many will compare this film to Gone Girl so if you need to know who wins then Gone Girl will be you answer. This film still stands well on its on which is why I will still encourage you to go see it.3.5 out of 5 stars for more movie reviews check out my site at www.payorwait.com",The Girl on the Train

507,aplangseth,Don't listen to anyone above a 6/10,3,15 October 2016,"I'm sorry but anyone rating this movie as above average must be really easy to please and I'm glad you get such easy satisfaction in life. Now anyone looking to go and enjoy the book in movie form or if you haven't read the book and just want a good mystery, should look elsewhere. From the very start of the movie it was a disappointment. Let me list it out for you starting with the negatives:1. The overzealous amount of tasteless sex scenes. 2. The location to change to the US which as an American I found stupid and unnecessary and insulting to Britain for a director to say that they aren't interesting enough or whatever for a movie to stick to the original book location. 3. The feeling of pure confusion and lack of organization. 4. The completely poor choices in casting, especially the therapist. 5. The confusion and lack of any clear cut direction through out the whole movie. The entire movie. It was impossible to follow.6. The addition of details that weren't in the book that added nothing, the subtraction of details from the book that were actually quite important, and the changing of details that you wondered why they changed them other than to maybe irritate people that have read the book7. The lack of anything to do with Anna and the amount they made Rachel more like an annoying idiotic drunk instead of like a drunk that just struggles due to alcoholism. 8. Their inability to follow the god damn timeline set out in the book. For the love of Jesus and all that is holy the timeline and organization through the book was pretty well laid out. What the hell were they doing.9. Honestly it was terrible. It was so bad. I've never written a review before and it was not good. Even my friends that didn't read the book didn't enjoy it and they wished we'd seen something else. 10. Practically gave away the ending. It's a mystery. How the hell do you do that. Positives:1. Emily blunt. She was kind of eh in the beginning of the book and I wasn't sure she was going to do well but once they stopped stressing the alcohol so much and she didn't have to act drunk she was better. Maybe she just sucks at acting drunk but overall the rest was a good performance. 2. I agree with one of the other reviews that the therapist was in there just the right amount. The book he is in there more and I don't mind that but his lesser emphasis in the movie still covered the better key points with him3. The ending was right and thank god it wasn't that long of a movie",The Girl on the Train
508,dougsetter,Painful to watch,3,16 October 2016,"I have to admit, great acting and filming.But it was painful to watch this film. Especially with the alcoholic woman literally stalking her former husband's home and the neighbor. Yet, nothing gets done and no charges are made. The three main men almost look the same, except for facial hair. The three main women are mentally unstable. Only one works part-time, sometimes. The rest are either supported by husbands and an ex-husband.All six were messed up beautiful people with too much time on their hands and were busy having affairs or thinking about it.I felt a shred of pity for the alcoholic, except that she blamed everything on someone else.The female detective was a tired old gal and the male detective was an over-weight, silent guy.It could have been a really good ""whodunnit.""

At the end ex-wife figured out her memories were fake and injected by tom hypnosis, he should immediately kill her but NOT hypnosis her again and allow her to run and kill him with stupid tool. for god sake.All the movie is dumb, a simple investigation turning to a crazy mind imagination.

It was difficult to follow the timeline so you will spend more time trying to figure out what the timing is rather than focusing on the story. Absolutely none of the characters are likable in this movie. They are all a mess and the story is not fleshed out enough for you to even care what happens to any of them. This is a waste of time and money. As many of the reviewers have already stated. This movie is boring and in areas that are meant to invoke some deep rooted pain or shock it just comes across as tasteless and in-your-face cringe worthy. None of the actors in this movie were great. They delivered their lines as if they were bored or in some cases annoyed that they had to even be there to collect their check.,The Girl on the Train

At the cinema we had to 'give and take' to decide. So no action, thriller or sci-fi for her and no romantic comedy for me. This movie was the perfect combination for both of us. There was some romance/drama but also a lot of tension! In the beginning you had to concentrate on the relationships between the personages which made the movie a hard starter (it was after half an hour that a group of teenagers left the movie theater).

The main reason I feel disappointed with this feature is the fact that the execution of such a simple story line was completely destroyed and maimed by the entire cast and production team. The use of poor actors who frankly couldn't act their way out of a pub pretending to be half cut. Emily Blunts performance was not only unconvincing, but it was almost entertaining, the kind of entertainment that you expect from a clown or village drunk. What I'm saying is, how in gods name did she manage to land this part in such a wide selling novel....?? Who knows? Only the director Tate Taylor can answer this question. Such a pathetic and weak performance it's almost unbearable, I found my self thinking about other things whilst watching this.If you're looking to throw away 2 hrs of your life time to watch this, don't!

516,Andy-JH,Not Another New York Times Best Seller,4,1 May 2021,"In a cinematic world crowded with remakes, spin-offs and blockbuster sequels after blockbuster sequels, it's good to finally get back to the heart of filmmaking: a good old-fashioned novel adaptation. The amount of cinema classics that are birthed from literature may be surprising to some, from Die Hard to Blade Runner, True Grit to The Maltese Falcon, Apocalypse Now to The Thing, adaptations truly are a cornerstone of film. The truth is Hollywood has never been original, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Somewhere on your list of favourite movies likely lies an adaptation of a novel, short story, biography, poem or a few dozen, and cinema is all the richer for it. This time it's The Girl on the Train, an adaptation of the 2015 novel of the same name by Paula Hawkins, which also went on to become the fastest selling adult novel in history. The film though, Starring Emily Blunt and Luke Evans, is currently sitting at 2016's okay-est thriller.Emily Blunt plays Rachel, our titular Girl, an alcoholic commuter who has a strange obsession with a couple that she can see from the window during her daily train journey. The film begins as a kind of rolling Rear Window, with Rachel only ever getting a couple of brief moments of the strangely ever-visible couple each day, as she pulls into the station behind their home. She tells us she has been following their routine for at least a year now and imagines their life as a perfect marriage, a young couple desperately in love, were nothing could ever go wrong. So, when one day Rachel spots the wife, Megan (Haley Bennet), kissing another man she can't help but stick her nose in. Rachel, we come to find, was also the victim of a cheating spouse and so seeing this act of betrayal, in a relationship she had fetishized as perfect seems to break this already deeply broken girl. Blunt admits to finding playing an alcoholic an interesting challenge within the film ""I didn't want it to be comical in any way; it has to be upsetting and embarrassing to be around her... But you also have to remember that this is a thriller and not just a portrait of alcoholism."" Blunt gives a strong performance overall, Rachel is a rich character and she gets a lot to sink her teeth into, but the writing never quite allows Rachel to become as unlikeable as she should be. Even in Rachels darkest moments she's portrayed far too sympathetically, and in the end, Blunt isn't really convincing as an alcoholic as far gone as we are made to believe Rachel is.Rebecca Ferguson is completely wasted here as Anna, the current wife of Rachels ex-husband, Tom (Justin Theroux, another underutilised talent), and previous other woman during Rachels marriage. Originally, in the source novel, the story is told distinctly from three perspectives: Rachel, Megan and Anna (two Rachel chapters for every one of the others). Though here Ferguson has little chance to do any more than model a bad wig, it's unfair to say she does nothing but she wasn't given enough material to make much of a performance. Rachel is made first and foremost lead in the film, poorly presented as an unreliable narrator, the writing gives few opportunities that allow the audience to doubt her. The Megan centric scenes though become the most intriguing, she is a far more interesting character with a far more engaging arc and her story feels unjustifiably condensed. For Megan, there is a lot of background we never really get a full picture of, and never fully understand why we are told it in the first place. In the end, all the time spent with the character feels so unnecessary when who she is plays so little into her role in the film. I can only assume this is a casualty of a story being poorly adapted from one format to another.Tate Taylor nabs his fourth feature directing credit here, after becoming known for more heart-warming fare such as 2011's The Help and 2014's James Brown bio-pic Get On Up. Girl doesn't try setting up the audience's fascination for the interesting setting, merely opting for a clunky voiceover for its exposition. A voiceover, that at a point could have been better utilised to create a film noir vibe, but instead disappears until used in an equally clunky manner to wrap things up near the end. The film falls short in building any real tension or intrigue, we are merely led along through the series of events without any truly impactful twists or intelligently designed red herrings. This leaves little time for any mystery to build, and while everybody else doubts Rachel, we have no reason to question anything the film tells us. ""I had to trust that if people... really got in with the characters... that it would really make the movie satisfying."" Says Taylor, but the film does far too much telling and not enough showing for an audience to really get ""with the characters.""
The film permeates a soggy bleakness (perhaps to represent the cloudiness of Rachels mind?), the desaturated colour scheme is reminiscent of 2014's Gone Girl, but instead of eliciting any meaningful emotion or mood it just leaves the film looking dull and lifeless. The foggy landscapes and soft rains repeat throughout, matched with the equally muted costumes and set design they give the viewer nothing but drab grey shapes to follow as they slowly, uneventfully collide.Blunt starred in one of the best thrillers in recent memory with 2015's Sicario, but this isn't lighting striking twice. The Girl on the Train falls into the same trap many lazy thrillers do, much like 2006's quirky crime caper Lucky Number Slevin, believing the best way to keep the audience guessing is to just outright lie to them. The Prestige taught us this is exactly the wrong tactic to use, a good mystery is all about sleight of hand. When you present your audience a scene, and give them no reason not to believe it, such as telling them it never happened it is going to leave them feeling cheated. I wasn't drawn in, and I never once felt like I didn't know what was going to happen in the end, not because I did know but because I never really cared where it went. A good thriller should make you care about each revelation, and a great thriller will make you doubt yourself, it will make you change your mind a dozen times and never be sure. However, Girl did neither. While 2016's other thrillers such as the brilliant Hell or High Water and Midnight Special have had brought me to the edge of my seat and kept me glued to the screen, The Girl on the Train left me comfortably reclined.",The Girl on the Train
517,gauloize,A crappy version of Gone Girl,4,10 January 2017,"This film had a lot of potential. The budget was there, the cast is great, we have top actresses that are professionals, have big enough names to bring viewers but aren't superstars that the film becomes all about them. The change of location isn't such a big deal.The problem is that it glosses over the backstories of the characters. We just find ourselves in the middle of this situation, we get some flashbacks, but it's a bit too late when it does. We get this image of Megan throughout the film, but when her backstory is shown in a flashback, it's too late for us to care. It's not big enough of a revelation for us to change our opinion of her. The film presents it as a twist, but it just feels like an anecdote. When there's a murder investigation, the story of your abortion appears insignificant in comparison.The other part I didn't like was that all the characters in the story were variations of the same person. If that was the point (highly doubt it) then this wasn't done well enough. If that wasn't the point, why is everyone some moody, depressive, suburban emo? It seems as if everyone suffers from depression - post-partum, alcoholic/unemployment, suburban-existential(?). What kind of depressive world is this?Why does a doctor named Kamal Abdic played by a Venezuelan actor? I'm not saying ""he doesn't look Yugoslav, blah blah"" - but couldn't they find a single Yugoslav actor? Maybe they couldn't and Ramirez is a higher profile actor, that's cool, but why didn't they change the name of the doctor to a Spanish name? They didn't even need to do that and it would just be a small oddity, but why is the doctor speaking Spanish? He actually spoke in fluent Spanish. That makes no sense at all for someone born in Yugoslavia. Ramirez didn't need to show us his Serbo-Croatian skills, he didn't need to even put on a Balkan accent, but why is a man from Bosnia speaking Spanish so fluently? How?Finally, there's some considerable spin going on in this film. Everyone is having an affair, but the movie makes it to be that it's all the fault of one man. It takes two to tango, but in here, everyone tangos but it's the fault of one individual. Basically, if two married people have an affair, it's the fault of the man. It just is. The strangest thing is that this Tom is shown as a terrible man - domestic violence, not-too-consensual-sex, fired from his job, serial cheater, liar, says horrible things, threatens his own child... so why are all these women attracted to him? There is not one good thing about him. He has no redeemable qualities, yet he is this irresistible man that makes women forget their own names, jobs or the fact that he's married.By cutting time from Tom's story and by giving him every bad quality possible, we are left with a caricature and the mystery of how all these women are attracted to him that they want to live with him, love him and bear his children.This film gets a failing grade.",The Girl on the Train
518,noahhaxbender,Surprisingly good,7,28 December 2016,"Before watching this movie I read a lot of reviews which to me were surprisingly negative. When watching this trailer I was automatically drawn into the plot and felt the urge to watch this movie, therefore I didn't understand the harsh criticism.I'm gonna make this a short review cause I don't want to spoil the movie and I also don't have that much to say. First of all, I really liked the main characters and how they were portrayed. A lot of people complained that you can't really relate to the characters and that the actors didn't do a good job as the main characters (Rachel, Megan & Anna). I don't agree with this statement at all. I really felt the pain along with these women and as the movie progressed I got more and more curious what was really going on in their lives. Sure, at some point in the movie I thought it was kinda slow and got a little boring. But I also felt that way about the amazing ""Gone Girl"", so I believe that's unavoidable with a psychology thriller as this one.Overall it has an exciting plot with a great twist in my opinion. It's a very deep and emotional movie that's not for everybody. But if you're a person who finds beauty in most arts, this will be a great movie experience for you.7/10.",The Girl on the Train
519,courtneymallinder,Intense,8,7 January 2017,"I haven't read the book, but decided to watch the film anyway! Even though the film is a little slow, I found it very intense, with hints of psychology, it is twisted, mysterious, dark and also brutal, I absolutely loved the film and wasn't at all what I expected! Emily Blunt (Rachel) plays the character so well as she is the main focus of the film, I would definitely give her 10/10 for her performance, absolutely outstanding. If you like films that are dark, brutal and also psychological then this is a film for you! After watching the film I have ordered the book to see the difference on what other reviews are about! It is a film that you should watch and make your own mind up about! Each to their own, I would definitely recommend!",The Girl on the Train
520,mdouglascollins,Good movie - awful ending,3,11 January 2017,A fairly good story and movie but with maybe the worst ending I have ever seen. Only possible in an American movie and so bad I almost could not believe it... There is an OK story and the acting is OK too. Good idea Good actors. I thought the killers motive was very thin and very unlikely. The actor playing Rachel was the best. She was authentic and I could follow where she was coming from. Good detail that she did not do all the stuff she was accused of. This was a fine twitch. Other than the ending the movie is OK. I really think the ending tells a story of a country that thinks there are good and bad people and that the bad people deserve to die. That is an awful way of thinking. I must take a major distance to this kind of thinking. This made the movie interesting on another level. it told me something about America that I only assumed be true.,The Girl on the Train
521,gulliverart,Acting towards a train wreck,5,11 February 2017,"This is a bad movie, to the point of the viewer having to try and find the goods there might be instead of the flaws it displays.Pros: Acting is not disappointing, photography is good level. Cons: Messy timeline with arguable flashbacks, poor implementation of the screenplay to the point of having all characters look like psychotic zombies in most of their interactions. The few sex scenes are sloppy, cold and nonsense, even considering they would all eventually hate each others. Violence and gore are seldom exaggerated, or simply unrealistic and bad taste. It is also doubtful that someone will be able to find the logical reason why the main character keeps the taste for train traveling once all the evil is purged and the initial reasons emptied.5/10 for the good acting, especially Emily Blunt's.This movie is likely to contain spoilers: it will definitely spoil your experience should you seek in it something more entertaining than a mediocre accomplishment. Having watched ""The Help"" from the same director I was far from expecting such flop.",The Girl on the Train

For someone who hasn't read the book I can honestly say I fell into the film, and by the film i mean the characters. It was very beautifully taken and also it was taken in the right tempo, not too slow and not too fast just the right speed which really impressed me because that's where most movies mess up. It was worth the time and I suggest that this movie be in your ""definitely"" watch-list cause this is one of the movies you should not only see but experience, the characters portrayed have displayed emotions so strongly and so really that it will feel more like reality than fiction.

I occasionally browse over reviews once I finish a movie to see what others thought, and maybe be filled in on subtle details I may have missed.I was however disgusted reading a variety of reviews here of shallow minded people that not only put pieces of the puzzle incorrectly together, but couldn't appreciate the superb performance of the main roles.**Don't listen reviews saying ""The book was better** Rarely can a movie pack the punch of a book with hundred's of pages into 2 hour movie. To those that haven't read the book, we couldn't care less about details being changed in the movie.It takes a while to get into the movie being that perspective's of multiple roles are shown to give full context. but it all gets neatly wrapped up for a climax at the end. Usually I like to pick apart flaws and poor acting but this was all believable and satisfying. It's a drama/mystery/thriller so you wont be finding any sunshine and butterflies here.

525,ryanmschexnayder,Great Acting in an Average Script,5,11 March 2017,"I have been a movie critic for years; having just viewed this film, and having never written a review on this site, I found this one to be worth the input.It's simple: Save your money and/or your time.Seriously.This movie has a great cast and they undoubtedly perform to the best of their abilities (Blunt is amazing as always). Unfortunately, the script is barely average and does the book minimal justice.Thete is very little tension throughout and you won't find yourself engaged until nearly 3/4 of the way in. I personally enjoy slow buildups in films, as long as the payoff is worth the wait. This is not one of those films.I give it a 5, as the best moments of it hover around a 6, and the lesser parts around a 4. If you find yourself with absolutely nothing on television and have two hours to kill, it won't be a total waste of your time. But, as the summary reflects, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it and definitely would not spend any money on it.",The Girl on the Train
526,debbiehalligan,The Girl on the Train,6,16 March 2017,"The Girl On the Train, a novel written by Paula Hawkins, was adapted into a screenplay starring Emily Blunt and Justin Theroux , directed by Tate Taylor, it was released in October of 2016. The film tells us the story of Rachel Watson, a newly divorced woman with a drinking problem. Her marriage to Tom seems to have fallen apart after she was unable to get pregnant. Rachel's daily train commute leads her past her old house, where her ex-husband, and his new wife and baby live. She is quite obsessed with watching them and a young couple next door who are the picture of love and happiness, everything she feels she lost. One morning ride on the train Rachel sees Meghan, the beautiful woman next door, out on the deck kissing someone who is not her husband. She becomes very distressed from this incident and has a night of excessive drinking. The next morning, she awakes a mess, and bloody. On the news, she learns Meghan is missing. Anna, Tom's new wife reports to the police she saw Rachel stumbling through the neighborhood, the police question Rachel. She tells them she believed Meghan was having an affair and even seeks out Meghan's husband to tell him the same. Just as the viewer is convinced Rachel killed Meghan, Meghan's body is found in the woods and then other truths become exposed. We learn the man Meghan was kissing on the deck was her therapist, Meghan was pregnant and neither her husband or her therapist were the father of the baby. When Rachel sees a wife of Tom's old boss on the train and tries to apologize for behaving badly while drunk at a party, she learns that was not the case. She begins to have flashbacks of events of her failed marriage and we learn Tom has been manipulating her for years making her believe she was in the wrong and everything was her fault. She goes to confront him, tells his new wife, he becomes very angry, admits to killing Meghan, fearing she was going to expose him as the father of her baby. Tom starts to beat Rachel, who is able to stab Tom in defense and then Anna assists in finishing him off. This murder mystery with all its twists and turns has been compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, although Rachel is not as crazy as Amy was from Gone Girl. Techniques used in the film include lighting, as Rachel is usually dark and gloomy, while Megan and Anna are bright and clean. On the train rides the camera angles allow us to view what Rachel sees, so we see things how she see them. When we learn at the end that Rachel's train rides were just a farce, she had been fired months before, we realize the movie really taught us nothing is quite how it seems. You really can't judge a book by its cover.",The Girl on the Train

Reason I was disappointed was the setting of the movie, it was Manhattan and not London like in the book and I know the movie isn't always exactly like the book but I was hoping it were more similar.

528,bamuna,Nice Movie with a fast script,6,1 April 2017,This is one of the good movies that I have ever watched. It shows the inner feelings of people how they act and how they react in various but hard situation in their lives. However the script of this film seems too fast and sometimes it misses valuable moments without a reason. Emily Blunt has done a fair job to her character but certainty the character has not been built up to the standard. People who read the book before the movie may have different view than others. I did not read the book at all.,The Girl on the Train

532,achatina,Do not bother,2,5 January 2017,"OK, first of all Emily Blunt is a great actress. It's worth wasting 1,5 hours of your life watching this movie just for her. The way she plays this drunk (at times) woman is just excellent. Other than that, it's really wasting 1,5 (or so) hours of your life. It's boring, unconvincing, doesn't get you involved. I don't know, there's just something wrong with the story and the characters. Where's the thrill? Where is the twist? Where's the biting-your-nails element? The feeling I had watching it was: I just don't care. There is no suspense, no drama, no mystery, nothing a movie of this kind should have. And come on - this husband/psycho guy... Really? I'm so disappointed. But hey, maybe my expectations were too high?",The Girl on the Train

534,contact-48488,"A good start, then downhill the rest of the way",5,28 June 2020,"My wife and I watched this film without real knowledge of what it was about. It began well enough and survived our usual practice of giving a movie ten minutes to engage us or we stop watching. We were intrigued as it got under way and we looked forward to a pleasant two hours accompanied by a glass or two of prosecco. But then the story got increasingly confusing. The prosecco can't in any way be to blame. First, there was the problem of three of the characters being blonde lookalikes, but what did it for us was the frequent, unnecessary and confusing time shifts. Despite this, we stuck with the film, hoping all along that it would get clearer and better, but it didn't, By the time the murderer was identified we had just stopped caring. A good story ruined by a too-clever script and too-clever editing. So, thank God for the chilled prosecco!",The Girl on the Train
535,JustFilmReviews,Something Missing,8,14 May 2019,"The acting, directing and story, was all amazing yet it fell just short of being an amazing film, and I would only categorize it as very good.The acting was seamless, particularly from Emily Blunt who showed a wide range of ability. Sometimes just one bad move from an actor can release you from the grasp of a film you are immersed in, and The Girl on a Train, cannot be faulted in the casting, as no one failed in that aspect.I felt the story itself, and the way that it was told was very interesting. I am usually someone who works out the end of a mystery before it concludes, and this film provided me with surprises that I don't usually receive. The film goes back and forth with an almost Tarantino feel to it, with a dreamlike haze that mirrors Emily Blunts character.So why was it that I felt there was something missing from this film to qualify it as amazing, rather than just a very good film. Well although all the acting was brilliant, and I forgot that any of the cast, was acting, until the end, there was perhaps only one moment that really moved me, and I did not feel myself on the edge of my seat or screaming at the TV during scenes that would usually call for such a response. I am finding it very difficult to discern to why this is,considering the before mentioned positives of this film. All I can say is that I did not have the nail biting reaction or feeling of overwhelming suspense, that would have made it great. I also didn't really feel a deep connection to the characters. I did feel myself rooting for (not giving away any spoilers) But not in a way that I have with classic, or even great films, were I feel like they are almost someone I know, and I am generally worried and upset that harm may come to them.I found out after watching the film that the novel was set In London, and I do wonder if this was the magic that was missing ,because as of yet I don't know what it is, but there is something.All in all it is a very enjoyable film, I believe that perhaps women would find this much more suspenseful and nail biting than I did, and also be able to feel stronger emotions towards both the male and female characters. Would defiantly recommend, and there are not many films that I have seen similar to this,particularly in more recent times.",The Girl on the Train
536,trancegrooves,If you loved the book... Do not watch this film.,3,28 May 2018,"Loved the book? This has very little to do with that. An almost all American cast, not set in the UK and lacking any of the information about character that gives depth and thus makes the story addictive.

I will note that I have not read the book, and I also acknowledge that books usually (if not always) are better than movies. However, this film is so subtly impacting it truly was a pleasure to watch. Emily Blunt portrays an impeccable female lead, I don't know that anyone could have done better. The emotional depth of this movie and the reality of prolonged emotional and psychological abuse is absolutely accurate. A story/movie does not have to be in-your-face and action-packed to leave an impression, and I can't help but feel that those who did not appreciate the raw purpose of this movie may not be intellectually or artistically capable of filling in the blanks themselves. Please watch this movie and judge for yourselves.",The Girl on the Train
