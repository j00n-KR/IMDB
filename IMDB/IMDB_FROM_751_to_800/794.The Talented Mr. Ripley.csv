0,MartinHafer,Good but the original was better...which is usually the case.,7,16 March 2013,"I had a much harder time watching ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" compared to the average person. This is because I have already seen the original version, ""Purple Noon"" (1960 with Alain Delon). So all along, I knew where the film was going and how it would end. So, there was no suspense for me and I kept comparing the new film with an older film that I adored--making my enjoyment a bit muted for this Matt Damon film.Normally, I might talk about the plot or how the two versions are different. However, this film is clearly a thriller with many exciting twists--so if I talk about it, I might give away what will happen. Suffice to say, in the Matt Damon version, what ultimately happens seems less planned and much more spontaneous--and certainly less evil. Both are very good films, however, well made and with lovely locale shooting and terrific acting. And, since they put a different spin on the plot, it would make for a great double-feature to watch them both. If asked to choose which one I'd like, I preferred the original film--but both are nice.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Slow perhaps, but absorbing thriller with beautiful scenery",8,9 December 2010,"Yes The Talented Mr Ripley is slow at times, but to me it is always absorbing and very rarely boring. The scenery is simply dazzling and really quite exotic, and the costumes and cinematography are gorgeous too. The music is superb, as is Anthony Minghella's direction. The story is very compelling with a number of interesting and well-handled scenes, while the script is both intelligent and thoughtful. The acting is excellent, Matt Damon does wonderfully in a difficult and perhaps controversial role, and Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann are equally terrific. Overall, quite an excellent film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Talented Mr. Ripley
2,SnoopyStyle,Perfect sense of dread,8,10 November 2013,"Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a struggling lower class bathroom attendant in 1950s Manhattan. He's mistaken for being in the world of the super wealthy when an upper crust man hires Tom to retrieve his wayward son Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) from Italy for $1000. He finds Dickie with his girlfriend Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) and is lured into the world of the leisure class. When Dickie gets tired of Tom, Tom does the unthinkable and uses his underhanded skills to hang on.Director/writer Anthony Minghella has instilled a sense of dread and foreboding. The acting is top notch with the most important coming from Matt Damon and Jude Law. There are honorable mentions to Philip Seymour Hoffman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett. I do wish they play up Tom Ripley's homosexual side with Dickie and intensify the creepiness. Other than that, this movie has the perfect tone and sense of doom. It is such a perverse movie that you almost root for the conniving Tom Ripley.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
3,Hitchcoc,The Talented Mr. Damon,8,16 March 2010,"I decided to start with the idea that I would throw out all the things that could go wrong in a plot like this. Suffice it to say that there are just too many things jig sawing neatly into place to avoid criticism. I really like Matt Damon. I absolutely despised his character in this; as I well should. He is dishonest to a fault. It makes me wonder if he had spent as much time in honest endeavors as he did in illegal ones, he probably would have been rich and successful anyway. Unfortunately, he is a sociopath, so from the beginning, honesty ain't going to happen. His tightly wound character with his chameleon-like abilities is able to adapt to any situation. It surprised me a bit when he became so violent, but it seems quite acceptable now. He hangs in that delicate balance. There are two people who scare him: Philip Seymour Hoffman who can see through his act, and Cate Blanchett, who has the unknowing capability to bring him down. The movie is all about Damon and what we see through his eyes. He simply has no morality, wanting the good life and taking it, mooching off other people and always coming out on his feet. It's easy to figure the Oscar nominations for this one. The movie is a bit long but the cinematography is wonderful. Italy is wonderful.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
4,lee_eisenberg,Would you try this?,7,15 February 2006,"Since my parents and I went to Italy for the millennium, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" was sort of a treat. The plot of course has Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) getting sent to Italy to bring pampered Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) back to the United States. But once Tom gets to know Dickie, he decides that he wants to become the guy...at any cost.For me, at least, this movie was all about the setting. It happens in the late '50s or early '60s. Certainly Dickie's hubby Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) gives it that look; an ""Entertainment Weekly"" preview described her as looking like Grace Kelly (which I'd call accurate). But the Italian setting gives the movie a Renaissance look, so there's an unusual dichotomy. I think that I read somewhere about a question as to whether or not Tom is gay. I couldn't tell whether or not he was. I've also never seen the French version of this movie with Alain Delon, so maybe I'm not the right person to be reviewing it. But either way, it's certainly well done, with good support from Cate Blanchett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and James Rebhorn.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
5,jboothmillard,The Talented Mr. Ripley,7,27 March 2007,"BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) has created a very good drama thriller, with two surprisingly good lead actors. Basically, Tom Ripley (Golden Globe nominated Matt Damon) started with borrowing a Prineton jacket to play piano at a garden party, and there he pretends to know the son of wealthy father Herbert Greenleaf (Independence Day's James Rebhorn), who offers him $1000 to convince his son, Dickie (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jude Law) to come home, from Italy. There, when Tom recognises Dickie, he becomes close friends with him and his fiancée, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow), pretending to like jazz, and having gay feelings for him. Besides lying, Tom has the talent of impressions and forgery, and when Dickie goes to extremes when telling Tom he's boring, Tom kills him. What Marge doesn't know in her worry is that Tom is pretending to be Dickie to get his lifestyle, as he looks similar to him. Also, as Dickie, has a love interest with Meredith Logue (BAFTA nominated Cate Blanchett), but also a close ""friendship"" with Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport). Also starring Capote's Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddie Miles, Sergio Rubini as Inspector Roverini and Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Alvin MacCarron. There are one or two slightly gory moments with Tom's murders, and a tragic end for him when he kills his gay lover, but this is one of those films where you know Damon and Law can be good actors. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Music for Gabriel Yared and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Gwyneth Paltrow was number 89, Jude Law number 60, and Cate Blanchett number 37 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Law was also number 10 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 59 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!",The Talented Mr. Ripley
6,ccthemovieman-1,"An Odd, Intriguing And - Yes - 'Strange' Film",8,21 August 2006,"This is an odd film. The first hour sets up Matt Damon's character, ""Tom Ripley,"" to do what he eventually does, kill someone and then imitate the rich kid off in Europe. However, to be fair, his murder of friend ""Dickie Greenleaf"" (Jude Law) is almost made to look like self-defense. It's an odd scene in this odd movie. As the story unfolds, however, ""Ripley"" is shown to be a sick killer, hardly some innocent man caught in some self-defense predicament.The second half of the film deals with Damon's character trying to get away with his scheme while other people slowly start to question who he is and what he's doing. Some people trust him; some don't. A few twists make the story even more interesting. The only facet that didn't appeal to me were the overt homosexual overtones in this film which were prevalent throughout Damon's relationships with a couple of men, although nothing sexually was ever done and even though these guys also had girlfriends. Speaking of the latter, Gwyneth Paltrow is good in here as ""Marge Sherwood,"" someone who is ahead of the pack when it comes to uncovering the truth. Cate Blanchett is good, too, as usual, but her role was much smaller and one I'm not sure was all about.Overall, this is intriguing drama-crime story with a lot of suspense and done so without a lot of violence. All the characters in this movie grab your attention. Combine that with good European scenery and involving storyline and you have a movie worth investigating.I read where this film also goes under the title, ""The Strange Mr. Ripley."" Strange, indeed.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
7,rmax304823,On Overstaying One's Welcome.,8,28 June 2002,"This is a considerably better movie than I'd expected. I'd only seen Matt Damon in one or two forgettable supporting roles before and thought of him as belonging to a recently minted crop of glamorous heart throbs like Brad Pitt, Leonard DaCaprio and Keanu Reeves, guys who seem to bring little presence to the screen. But I was wrong about Damon, at least as far as ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is concerned. He turns in a subtle and nuanced performance. And he LOOKS the part in a well-bred sort of way but with a sinisterly twisted mouth, a face as handsome and as meaningless as the full moon. Yes, in his appearance, including his grooming, he could easily pass for an old-breed Princetonian, the kind who belongs to a self-defined superior WASP elite, the sort ground out by Princeton, a factory for the uptrodden, a few generations ago, who know they're better than others and enjoy letting others know about it -- like Dicky here, or Richard Brookheiser at the so-called Free Press in actual life. Don't mean to put Old Nassau down too much. I was a proctor there.I was expecting a kind of thriller along the lines of ""Strangers on a Train,"" basically a mystery with character development built into it. There's little mystery here, except whether Ripley, a remorseless con man, is going to get away with it. I also expected him to enter the narrative deliberately committed to grabbing with both hands for every opportunity for exploitation and self-advancement that came within reach. Instead he is drawn into the narrative quite by accident. And, although he shows an early ability to adapt to ambiguous situations, he doesn't seem to have planned out very much. The entire story is more or less one accident after another. Ripley switches identities and keeps running into people who know him under different names in the most unlikely places. A bit more of that sort of thing, played for laughs, and we'd almost have ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" redux.Two other observations. The ambiance of Italy in the mid-1950s is gotten down pat. It's winter, and in Mediterranean climates this is the rainy season, so the streets are often slick and the shadows deep and disturbing. No sunny vistas here. And we get the grand tour of Italy -- the Spanish steps, the fountain of Trevi, the grand canal, somebody walking through a horde of pigeons in St. Mark's Square. Even the grooming is accurate. Horn-rimmed glasses, and long hair conservatively parted on the side. (That's accurate for Europe, anyhow. Americans had shorter hair at the time, with lots of crew cuts.) The background music includes Mozart but is mainly jazz, as it was in Europe at the time.The second observation. Some reviews have referred to ""a gay subtheme."" I don't see anything ""sub"" about it. Ripley is clearly homosexual -- I'm dying to call him polymorphously perverse! -- or at least bisexual, like the author of the novel on which the story is based. Ripley's last affair is openly with a gay man. And there are homoerotic incidents and references slipped in whether they belong there or not. In a public square, one man sits spread legged across another's thighs and caresses his hair. Right. Freddy Miles, the vilest of the class snobs, walks around limp wristed (literally) and drips with catty sarcasm.Patricia Highsmith's novel, which gave Hitchcock ""Strangers on a Train,"" had no mind-numbing literary qualities. It was a rather straightforwardly written piece with no particular stylistic flourishes. I don't know if her writing style had changed in the few years between ""Strangers"" and ""Mr. Ripley,"" but I doubt it. In that case, a good deal of the credit for the exploration into these fascinating characters must go to the director. He, like most of the others involved in this production, did a very nice job with it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
8,Tweekums,A good amoral drama,8,2 January 2017,"Tom Ripley is a bit of a non-entity but also a bit of a chameleon who can make people think he belongs. After the wealthy Herbert Greenleaf mistakenly thinks Tom was a friend of his son Dickie he is given a job to go to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to New York. He quickly meets Dickie and his girlfriend Marge Sherwood and befriends them. He is honest about why he is there but makes Dickie believe that they share similar interests. Soon he is staying with Dickie and Marge while still being paid by Dickie's father. Eventually Herbert Greenleaf writes to thank Tom for his work but also to let him know it is clear that he has failed in his task and will no longer be paid. At the same time Dickie starts to get tired of Tom's presence. Tom doesn't take this well and strikes Dickie; a struggle ensues and Dickie is killed. Tom manages to hide the death and carries on his life he also starts playing the part of Dickie; a role he enjoys. Inevitably the deception is hard to maintain; Marge wants to know what happened to Dickie and when a friend of Dickie pays a visit Tom must kill again to protect his secret a killing the police believe Dickie may have committed.This was a really enjoyably film; plenty of time is spent introducing the characters and by the time of Dickie's death Tom is the more sympathetic character so it is easy for the viewer to see it as self-defence and hope he gets away with it. Even when he kills again it isn't hard to still hope he gets away with it as this victim was a frightful snob who had always looked down on Tom and people like him it is only when Marge starts to be emotionally harmed by Tom's actions that sympathy for him starts to wane. The cast does a fine job; Matt Damen is particularly good as Tom Ripley; a character who isn't naturally dynamic but can play the part when needed. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow also impress as Dickie and Marge. The story isn't rushed but nor does it drag and once Dickie has died the tension gradually rises; there is always the possibility that Tom will be exposed, either by the police or somebody who knows Dickie, and each to it looks like he could be exposed there is the feeling that people around him are in danger. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good drama set in some beautiful Italian locations.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
9,dbdumonteil,I took your name (R.E.M.),8,26 April 2003,"Possible Spoilers...This is the second adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel, ""the talented Mr Ripley"" and besides, a remake of René Clément' fabulous movie, ""Plein Soleil"" (1959). If Anthony Minghella's movie can't hold a candle to Clément's movie, it remains a good detective movie that contains quite numerous qualities.First, the movie enjoys a quite outstanding performance, especially Matt Damon. He doesn't rely too much on his physique and plays his role with conviction.The movie also enjoys a watertight and relevant screenplay, maybe a little too well-crafted that sometimes it's hard to follow the plot. Furthermore, you can blame Minghella for not dwelling enough on Dicky Greenleaf's haughty and scornful behavior, in the first hour of the movie. In the novel, this last one wants to impress and even to humiliate Tom Ripley by taking advantage of his wealthy and favored situation, but in this remake, it's not really the case. Minghella neglected this side of the screenplay. He also doesn't dwell enough on Ripley' inferiority complex.Nevertheless, Minghella could skilfully lead the suspense until the end that you can't really consider as a happy-end because Ripley triumphs over the situation and no-one knows the truth.A fair detective movie and a remake that for once didn't turn out to be pointless.NB:A note about Marge Sherwood: Patricia Highsmith's hate and contempt for the character was intense in the novel (as was Ripley's);and she didn't suspect Ripley at all when the story ended.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
10,blanche-2,too long and a disappointment,6,7 July 2000,"Though the scenery was magnificent, I found this film, which I was very much looking forward to seeing, very disappointing. It seemed endless - and the last time that happened was during ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" which is not a positive statement. Instead of being intrigued (as I expected to be) I found the actions of Tom silly and thought the whole plot would have been better served as a comedy. A serious film with this theme would not have had the character stay in the same general area or even the same country. Doing so made this film almost Marx Brothers without the laughs.The source material, which is the Patricia Highsmith novel of the same name, is much better served in ""Purple Noon,"" which stars Alain Delon. Rene Clement's direction has real style and pace, and Delon is a very effective Ripley. The story becomes much more believable. Though the ending is not faithful to the book, I highly recommend Purple Moon over the more vapid The Talented Mr. Ripley.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
11,Quinoa1984,Considering,7,11 August 2000,"Considering this type of film and It's actors, this film is kinda weird. But, it does give some credibility back to Anthony Minghella, the writer/director of The English Patient which I found pretty bad.  This time, he brings a movie that actually is interesting, and peculiarly dramatic film.  Matt Damon brings a pretty good performance in the works as Tom Ripley, a man who is very smart, very bright, and very talented.  He is also a pathological liar who loves the life that a couple (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law) lead so much, he does something to become apart of it.  A little long, but at least it is not as boring as English patient.  Yet, don't rush top to rent this film, because there are a few flaws.  But for fans of the actors or director, this is definately your film.  B+",The Talented Mr. Ripley
12,wes-connors,Strangers on a Boat,10,23 December 2008,"In late 1950s New York, closeted Matt Damon (as Tom Ripley) works as a lowly lavatory attendant, and part-time piano player. After borrowing a fellow pianist's jacket, Mr. Damon is mistaken for a Princeton graduate. Taking advantage of his mistaken collegiate identity, Damon accepts a wealthy man's proposal: he is paid to travel to Italy, and persuade charismatic playboy Jude Law (as Dickie Greenleaf) to return home. But, instead of retrieving the handsome Mr. Law, Damon falls in love with Law, and his lifestyle.""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a mysterious, yearning, secretive, sad, lonely, loving, musical, gifted, intelligent, beautiful, tender, sensitive, haunting, and passionate film (not to mention astonishing and enduring). Comparisons to Hitchcock and Fellini are entirely appropriate (not to mention Roman Polanski and George Stevens). But, director Anthony Minghella's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel is not an imitation or homage; it succeeds completely on its own merits.The setting delivered by Minghella, John Seale (photography), Roy Walker (art direction), Bruno Cesari (set direction), and Gabriel Yared (soundtrack) is motion picture perfect. The entire cast and crew are at career peak levels. Law garnered some well-deserved ""Supporting Actor"" attention for his irresistible ""Dickie""; and, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Freddie Miles) is also worthy.Damon's necessarily more complex characterization was slighted in the ""Best Actor"" category; he is appropriately layered and lackluster around Law, while subtly sucking the life out of his flashy co-star. Damon plays for keeps. Fellow travelers Gwyneth Paltrow (as Marge Sherwood), Cate Blanchett (as Meredith Logue), and Jack Davenport (as Peter Smith-Kingsley) perfectly portray love as a many splendored thing.

The talented Tom Ripley (Matt Damon)has a way when it comes to impressing others. Without an enviable persona, Tom can assume other people's lives. Jude Law plays Dickie, a millionaire playboy marking time in Italy listening to Jazz with his girlfriend. Gwyneth Paltrow is easy on the eyes as the mild mannered girlfriend.

14,sunwarrior13,Matt Damon Excels As Tom Ripley,9,30 December 2011,"After the Oscar-winning The English Patient, writer and director Anthony Minghella attempted another tricky literary adaptation with The Talented Mr. Ripley, which features heartthrob Matt Damon cast against type as a psychopathic bisexual murderer. It is an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith 1955 novel of the same name, which was previously filmed as Purple Noon back in 1960. The film features Damon as Tom Ripley together with Gwyneth Paltrow,Jude Law,Cate Blanchett,Philip Seymour Hoffman,Jack Davenport,James Rebhorn, and Celia Weston.Tom Ripley is a bright and charismatic sociopath who makes his way in mid-'50s New York City as a men's room attendant and sometimes pianist, though his real skill is in impersonating other people, forging handwriting, and running second-rate scams. After being mistaken for a Princeton student, Tom meets the shipping tycoon father of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), who has traveled to the coast of Italy, where he's living a carefree life with his father's money and his beautiful girlfriend, Marge.Dickie's father will pay Ripley 1,000 dollars plus his expenses if he can persuade Dickie to return to America. As Ripley and Dickie become friends, Tom finds himself both attracted to Dickie and envious of his life of pleasure. In time, he decides that he would rather be Dickie Greenleaf than Tom Ripley, so rather than go back to his life of poverty, Ripley impulsively murders Dickie and assumes his identity.With Damon's unsettling performance offering a darkly twisted counterpoint to Minghella's glossy direction, this is a suspense thriller that lingers.Also,the story was intelligent psychological thriller of huge style and depth.Aside from Damon,Law has great performance as well.Definitely,this is one good movie that one must not miss.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The story involving murder, love and psychos is intelligent and adult. ALL the acting is great (especially Law who is truely beautiful)--that's a big compliment from me considering I hate Paltrow and Damon.  The only debit, and this is minor, is the film moves a bit too slowly and it ocassionly seems too full of itself, too self-assured on how beautiful it is.

17,dbborroughs,One of the most hateful characters ever created begins here,9,28 June 2004,"Tom Ripley is one of the most vile characters ever born. He is a man with no morals, no scruples, nothing that would mark him as a ""good"" man. He is a character so hateful that he will forever be removed from the role of great villains simply because we find him so unpleasant. Unfortunately despite the fact that we know how terrible he is, we can do nothing to warn those in the book or movie and so we have to suffer as he seemingly sweetly tears apart their lives for his own gain. Ripley will forever be the nice guy to all of those around him, until the learn the hard way just how bad he is. 
And yet despite the pain, we watch and read about him. I,myself, am both repelled and drawn to the films that have been made about his exploits. There have been several over the years, some good, some terrible. Here in the person of Matt Damon Ripley finds just the right mix of sweet and sour.I don't want to spoil anything, but this is the first Ripley story. Here he's asked to bring a school chum home. Only things are not as they seem and Ripley is soon way over his head in a game of manipulate everyone and everything.It's very well made.

The movie was too long and it took 45 minutes for anything of significant interest to happen.Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) was sent to Italy to bring back Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) at the request of Dickie's father. Tom had just stepped foot in Italy and he was already lying about who he was to Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett), but after that seemingly innocuous scene Tom settled into a lively and drama free life with Dickie. That was until Dickie told Tom that play time was over. That's when Tom killed Dickie. Even after this the movie only gained moderate traction.

His name is Tom Ripley is sent to Rome by a wealthy industrialist to bring back his son Dickie. Tom is able to consume identities while rejecting his own. They get acquainted immediately then he joins Dickie and his girlfriend to the jazz clubs. With a corrupt conclusion the film is well crafted by director Anthony Minghella but way too predictable and laden with clichés. This does not rank with his previous film The English Patient but its identity theme is inviting. Matt Damon delivers a brilliant performance as Ripley who knows not who he is but what he should be. Jude Law is terrific as Dickie whose confidence cannot detect betrayal. Gwyneth Paltrow as Marg is suspicious of Tom and eventually becomes concerned with her own survival. Cate Blanchett seems unnecessary as a vacationer who pops into the movie a few times with nothing to offer. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a friend of the Law character who grows suspicious of Mr. Ripley and dies for it. Theme regards personality disorders and the idea of an individual who is unable to be himself because he doesn't know who he is.

21,HotToastyRag,Tour-de-force performance by Matt Damon,9,13 December 2017,"Jude Law was nominated for an Oscar for his role in The Talented Mr. Ripley; Matt Damon was not. To this day, I think there was a mistake while submitting the ""for your consideration"" names to the Academy. Jude Law wasn't really given anything to do in the film, besides look incredibly handsome and emit an aura of appeal. Matt Damon, the title character, gave a tour-de-force performance deserving of a win-the only way to explain his lack of a nomination is if there was a mistake.Matt Damon plays a very troubled young man who longs for attention, acceptance, and love. He doesn't feel those things when he's himself; the only way he feels complete and alive is when he pretends to be someone else. For example, he borrows a fancy dinner jacket and attends a party, someone mistakes him for a well-to-do Princeton graduate, and he transforms into the man he's thought to be. He enjoys his disguise and likes it infinitely better than his own skin. The subtleties Matt Damon brings to his performance are breathtaking. A lesser actor would have played the part differently, and the film-despite Anthony Minghella's beautiful directing and Gabriel Yared's intense music-would have felt a little cheap. Matt Damon truly becomes Mr. Ripley, just as convincingly as Mr. Ripley becomes other people. You can see every reason behind his behavior clearly on his face, and every hurt, shame, doubt, and fear is communicated delicately between him and the camera. It's an incredible performance.A host of familiar faces join the supporting cast, including Cate Blanchett, James Rebhorn, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, Jack Davenport, Celia Weston, and Gwyneth Paltrow, as Jude Law's girlfriend. I've always felt Gwyneth to be exceptionally talented at blending into her roles. She's just as convincing in Emma as she is in Shallow Hal, and in this film, she seems completely at home in her 1950s surroundings.Depending on how dark you like your movies, you might hate The Talented Mr. Ripley or you might add it to your collection to watch on dark, spooky evenings. I've seen it twice, because I love films with fantastic acting in them. Just be aware it isn't for the faint of heart, and there are some pretty upsetting scenes in it.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
22,safenoe,Moving and captivating,10,21 December 2016,"This is the 700th user review, and I'm proud to provide my thoughts on The Talented Mr Ripley. So much has been said about it, but Matt Damon really demonstrates his acting chops and shows his range in a complex and ambiguous role where you wonder if the audience is supposed to empathize with him as he seeks to further his lot in life.If you get a chance, check out to the director's commentary, and it's definitely worth listening to. The denouement in this fine movie was very haunting, as you realize Tom has nowhere to go but eliminate Peter in order to protect himself from being exposed to Meredith. Such is the life that Ripley must now lead.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
23,The_Void,Envigorating and effective masterpiece,9,19 December 2004,"When it comes to naming the best films of the 1990's, The Talented Mr. Ripley hardly ever gets a mention. This is one of cinema's greatest mysteries; how can a film as well made, constantly intriguing and brilliantly conceived as this one constantly get passed over? And in favour of many under deserving films as well? Really strange. Almost as big a mystery as the one I've just mentioned is the web of intrigue created here. Through deep, complex characters and situations rich with double meaning, Anthony Minghella has turned Patricia Highsmith's original novel into a cinematic masterpiece. The talented Matt Damon stars as the talented man of the title that is offered $1000 to travel to Italy to try and return Dickie; the rich and spoilt son of a millionaire. What follows is a complex, disturbing and fascinating expose of a man ingratiating himself into the lives of Dickie, his girlfriend Marge and high society on the whole...The main reason why The Talented Mr. Ripley works so well is that it's central characters are deep labyrinths that beg to explored and analysed. Every scene is rich with double meaning and character interactions that exist under the surface of the drama we are seeing on screen. The character of Tom Ripley is a true masterpiece of characterisation indeed. This sociopath, that would rather be ""a pretend somebody than a real nobody"" is a myriad of contradictions and muddled personalities. His actions are always amoral and through his lies and deception, it is obvious that he doesn't care at all for anyone around him. However, despite this; we are still able to feel for him through his tribulations. The story is told in such a way that it is difficult to feel for any of the other characters and all of our sympathies lie with the talented Tom Ripley. This puts the audience in a strange situation, as we're used to hating the antagonist and feeling for the protagonist, but this film turns that on it's head, and to great effect.The film is helped implicitly by the fact that it's one of the most professionally made films ever to make it onto the screen. Every scene, every action, every line uttered is done with the greatest assurance and nothing at all in the film appears to be there by accident or out of place. The way that the characters interact with each other and their surroundings is always believable and we never question anything that is shown on screen. Anthony Minghella's direction is more than solid, and this is helped by the stunning photography, courtesy of 1950's Italy. Many a film has benefited from Italy's landscape, and this is one of them. This is all great, but it's the performances that put the final finishing touch on this amazing masterclass of film-making. As mentioned, the talented Mr Damon takes the lead role and completely makes it his own. He often gets coupled with his friend, Ben Afleck, when it comes to acting; but this is very unfair as Damon is one of today's brightest stars. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow make up the other two leads. I'm not the biggest fan of either of these two stars, but both, like Damon, give performances here that will always be associated with their personalities. Cate Blanchett has a small role, but the real plaudits for the smaller performances go to the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene he's in.The Talented Mr. Ripley is one stunning piece of film. Ignore the people that don't consider this one of the 1990's greatest achievements; they are wrong. The film is a masterpiece of tense situations, great characterisation and professional film-making. And I refuse to hear otherwise.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
24,zetes,I was expecting something a lot better than this,7,15 July 2000,"_The Talented Mr. Ripley_ is a good film aspiring to be a great film. There are many problems which stop it from attaining its greatness.
Pros:1. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law - the two best performances in the film. Jude Law certainly deserved his Oscar nomination, even though I feel he did better in David Cronenberg's _eXistenZ_, but, hey, I don't expect either the Academy or the common people to understand or accept a Cronenberg film. Gwyneth Paltrow could have easily been nominated for Best Supporting actress, maybe even Best Actress, although her role is weak compared to her amazing turn in 1998's _Shakespeare in Love_. 2. Great setting and cinematography - Italy is so beautiful in this film, and the camera movements and positions were divine. Probably the best reason to see the film.Cons:1. Philip Seymour Hoffman - I normally love this guy, even in tripe like _Twister_. But, even though people tend to think of him as a character actor, he really isn't anymore. It's hard to buy him as an elite party animal when I'm so familiar with his normally shy character. He seems totally wrong for the part.2. Philip Baker Hall - a late cameo by him is just distracting. I normally like him a lot, too, but his character, the one scene that he's in, just made me think of his famous character in _Seinfeld_ as Bookman, the library cop.3. The character of Peter just appears out of nowhere about half way or even two-thirds of the way through the film. His character is never even introduced. He provides one last scene near the end which I felt was superfluous.4. Cate Blanchett - also, I've loved her two major parts, the first in _Oscar and Lucinda_, a highly underrated film, and the second in _Elisabeth_, in which she was at least equal to Gwyneth Paltrow in _Shakespeare in Love_. Her problem here is that her character seems superfluous, or, rather, she's more of a prop than a character. Her character causes two of the major plot twists in the film, and neither one of those twists were pleasing. In fact, the final twist seems to only be necessary because Cate Blanchett's character would have ended up as a loose end. Thus, her character basically lengthens the already long film. Which leads me next to my next complaint:5. Too complex for its own good - The plot twists seem to come around logically in the first half of the film, but after a while, it seems that the story is becoming complex just to do so. It gets so out of hand, that the audience is forced to sit through several scenes of standard detective/police search cliches. Plus, the film could have ended with Dickie's note to Tom, but instead the film labors on pointlessly and repetitively for another thirty or forty minutes.6. The score, while sometimes nice and jazzy, is more often intrusive. Strangely, it isn't (normally) prominent, but it constantly tries to underline the sneakiness of Ripley, which is not what should have been underlined. Nothing should be underlined by a score.
And then there's Matt Damon, about whom I have said nothing. Well, his part in the movie is difficult to judge. After all, the entire movie, it being named after his character, kind of relies on his performance. Well, here's my take on it. Damon begins the movie amazingly well, but after the bodies start turning up, something happens. And I can't really say whether the character of Ripley falls apart because of the script or because of Damon. The main problem is either that Damon cannot play a psychopath very well, or that the shift to psychopath in the Ripley character was not a wise decision in the first place. I'm leaning towards the script as the culprit, because there were a couple of scenes where I was thinking, ""Well, this isn't the same Tom we met earlier in the film. This one's a lot less composed."" Especially when he couldn't explain from where he got Dickie's rings. That discovery seemed to me to be a lot less vital than any of the characters seemed to think it was.So, in conclusion, it is worthwhile, but it's nowhere near Hitchcock. 7/10.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
25,Sylviastel,"Great Cast, Director, but troubled writing!",7,15 June 2007,"I don't know why nobody in this film is troubled by Tom Ripley from New York City who arrives to persuade New York millionaire playboy, Dickie Greenleaf played fine by Jude Law, and Gwyneth Paltrow who plays his equally rich girlfriend, Marge Sherwood. The scenery in Italy is the best part of the film for me since I never been there. I'm troubled as to the whole plot involving Ripley who is supposedly smarter than the victims that he victimizes with his charms. The whole Highsmith story is probably a lot more intense. I don't know if the director (Anthony Minghella) intended to create a homosexual moods between Dickie and Tom. I think Matt Damon is the wrong choice to play Tom Ripley. He doesn't convey the ability to pull off the ultimate con job of all time. The audience does feel for Ripley who is obviously troubled and wants to be somebody else other than his own identity. All we know is that he can sing and play piano. Ripley consumes Dickie's identity and himself to become something or somebody he is not. The Talented Mr. Ripley also casts the brilliant under-rated James Rebhorn as Dickie's father. On the whole, I don't feel sorry for any of Ripley's victims like Dickie and Marge who are too self-involved and absorbed with their own wealth and privileges to understand how the under-classes feel for them. After all, Ripley never went to Princeton like Dickie and others and nobody seems to notice Ripley's lack of history, his lack of knowledge about Princeton, etc. Wouldn't a normal person ask questions about Princeton professors and school itself?",The Talented Mr. Ripley
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) The Talented Mr Ripley (1999),7,8 January 2006,"Identity theft has in recent times become a concern, with so much of your personal information made available online, it's relatively easy for someone else, to be you. Someone could probably learn about your name, your banking account, the school you went to, and so on.And that's the premise of The Talented Mr Ripley, minus the technology. Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a professional leech. He has the uncanny ability to remember minute details that get dropped off here and there, and has the charisma and confidence to assume your identity and pass it off. He's a master impersonator and forger too, skills in which an identity thief will find essential in siphoning funds from your accounts, or write letters and sign them off as yours.By chance, he meets a shipping magnate, Herbert Greenleaf, and he's tasked with getting Greenleaf's good for nothing son, Dickie (Jude Law), back to the US. Dickie's been living the good life with fiancé Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Italy, and as Tom gets to interact with the rich folks, he begins to enjoy the high life as well.Living it off, eating well, visiting jazz clubs, sailing on a yacht. Dickie's lifestyle seduces Tom, and the latter offers to be a ""double agent"" for Dickie. That is, until things spin out of control, and he unwittingly slaughters Dickie.Which of course gives him the best opportunity to assume Dickie's life, while at the same time, eluding the authorities, and from those who know Dickie intimately. It's interesting to see how Tom squirms his way through various situations, as each lie led to bigger lies to tell and cover up. But it doesn't degenerate into a ""whodunit"", rather this movie is rather dark in tone as it progresses.Matt Damon totally rules in this one. We're accustomed to his Bourne roles, as well as the sidekick roles in various movies. Here, he plays a schizophrenic psycho to great effect, outshining everyone else. Jude Law's role as Dickie was kinda short, and doesn't showcase much of Law's acting abilities, I thought that the story might offer Dickie some sort of comeback to avenge what Tom did to him, but sadly, it did not. Gwyneth Paltrow didn't had much to do here, kind of like her role in Se7en. Cate Blanchett appears as a minor character Meredith Logue, the first person whom Tom impersonates Dickie to.Unknowing to me, this film does have homoerotic undertones, in Tom's relationship with Dickie (or what he actually suggests), and Tom's relationship with Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport).Unfortunately, this Code 1 DVD is also the barebones version. Would have loved to hear the director's commentary on this movie.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
27,whpratt1,Gwyneth Paltrow Was At Her Very Best!,10,5 August 2004,"Some how I seemed to have missed this film and greatly enjoyed the great talents of Matt Damon,(Tom Ripley),""Jersey Girl"",'04, who was very talented in many fields and also had a great struggle with his split personality and seemed to fall a part when Jude Law,(Dickie Greenleaf),""Cold Mountain"",'03, told him the truth about himself which destroyed his brain completely!   Gwyneth Paltrow,(Marge),""Sylvia"",'03, was very much in love with Dickie Greenleaf and found Tom Ripley very entertaining and funny. However, Dickie played the field and one Italian gal became pregnant.  This film takes you all around Italy with lots of money being spent and at the expense of Mr. Greenleaf, Sr.,  who is trying to get his son to settle down and return to their estate.  This is truly a great film with great actors.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
28,namashi_1,Good Film...,6,16 January 2011,"'The Talented Mr. Ripley', an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith 1955 novel of the same name, directed by Anthony Minghella, is a good film. The Oscar-Winning Late Filmmaker handles this cruel story with manners, however his writing towards the finale is a complete give-away.'The Talented Mr. Ripley' is a twisted and disturbing story, of Tom Ripley, a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. He is maybe, the most believable liar, who goes full throttle after things get weird for him. He kills people. He lives on others names. In short, amongst the biggest villains human-beings have seen on Screen ever.The film has a rock-solid first-hour, and keeps it's momentum high, but the final 25-30 minutes are not convincing. Anthony Minghella's adapted screenplay is mostly captivating, how one truly wishes if it had a more convincing culmination. As a director, Anthony Minghella wonderfully captures Mr. Ripley's journey. He makes sure that in each frame his character is felt and talked about. John Seale's Cinematography is striking. Walter Murch's Editing is good.Performance-Wise: Matt Damon is incredible as Mr. Ripley. This performance ranks amongst his finest works. Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent. Jude Law is super-efficient, while Philip Seymour Hoffman doesn't miss a single beat. Cate Blanchett leaves a mark. Jack Davenport is passable. Philip Baker Hall is terrific in a tiny role.On the whole, A Good Film, that offers thrills and makes a memorable character.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
29,JamesHitchcock,A psychological case-study that lacks depth.,6,5 January 2005,"The talented Mr Ripley of the film's title is Tom Ripley, a young man who meets and becomes friendly with Herbert Greenleaf, a wealthy industrialist. Although Ripley has never been to university, he manages to persuade Greenleaf that he was at Princeton with Greenleaf's son, Dickie. Dickie is an idle young playboy, and Greenleaf, who disapproves of his son's lifestyle, entrusts Ripley with the task of travelling to Italy, where Dickie is currently living, and persuading him to return to America to take up a position in the family business. Greenleaf offers to pay all Ripley's expenses, and Ripley is happy to accept the old man's money. He has, however, no serious intention of persuading Dickie to return. He travels to Italy where he meets Dickie and his fiancée Marge, and a friendship develops between the two young men. Ripley spends the next few months living with Dickie and Marge at their luxurious villa in a picturesque coastal town. Tensions arise, however, when Dickie tires of Ripley, suspecting him of leeching off his money, and Dickie is killed during a quarrel between the two on board a boat off the coast. Ripley disposes of the body and adopts Dickie's identity, using a talent for forgery to draw money from Dickie's account as he travels round Italy.The film is set in the 1950s, and is reminiscent of that period in a number of ways. The ""dolce vita"" atmosphere of fifties Italy is lovingly recreated. Dickie and his friends lead the hedonistic lifestyle of the international jet-set- yachting, skiing, nightclubs, jazz parties and lounging on the beach. The lush, picture-postcard style photography reminded me of the travelogues of the period. There is also something of the fifties about the film's attitude to sexuality. There are strong hints that Ripley is gay or bisexual and that Dickie and he are sexually attracted to each other. The homosexual overtones become even stronger later in the film when Ripley is befriended by Peter, a young Englishman also travelling in Italy. Yet in neither case is the nature of the relationship made explicit. The only outright reference to homosexuality comes when the Italian policeman who is investigating Dickie's murder asks Ripley if he thinks that Dickie had developed homosexual tendencies. Neither the policeman nor the audience ever find out the true answer to this question.In the fifties, of course, any direct reference to homosexuality was forbidden by the Production Code of the period, so directors had to approach the subject obliquely. (A good example is Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"", also based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, where it is hinted- but never stated- that Bruno may be sexually attracted to Guy). I thought, however, that by the nineties, a decade in which Tom Hanks won an Oscar for playing a gay man, we no longer needed to approach these matters so coyly. Anthony Minghella, however, seems to like playing games with his audience, because this is only one of several matters that are left unclear. We never, for example, really discover why Ripley kills Dickie, whether the killing was premeditated and when he first formed his plan of stealing not only Dickie's money but also his identity.In the cinema, as in literature, mystery and ambiguity can, in the context of certain films, be as interesting as precision and hard fact. I did not, however, find ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" to be a film of that type. It would have worked best as a psychological study of the main character, but we were told too little of his psychology to enable us to understand his behaviour. I found that the film was too long, a fault it shared with Anthony Minghella's previous film,the overrated ""The English Patient"". There was also at times a rather uneasy mix of genres. The scene at the opera, where Ripley meets both Meredith (who believes him to be Dickie) and Marge (who knows him by his true identity) and has to ensure that he is never seen by both women at the same time would be more at home in a farce than in a serious crime drama.There is some good acting, especially from Jude Law as the spoilt, fickle Dickie, alternately friendly and affable or childish and petulant as the mood takes him. It was noticeable that the pace of the film slackened and it became less enjoyable after Dickie's murder.Philip Seymour Hoffman was also good as the obnoxious, self-satisfied Freddie Miles, a friend of Dickie who becomes suspicious after his death. The main part of Ripley, however, never came alive for me; I felt that this was less the fault of Matt Damon than of the script. The film has its good points, but overall I found it unsatisfactory, a study of a criminal that studied him in insufficient depth. 6/10",The Talented Mr. Ripley
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,Excellent,9,21 September 2004,"I have to say that I really enjoyed ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". The drama was intense, the actors were wonderful, and the directing was great. There was only one flaw that bothered me and that was at the end.SPOILERS!!!Mr. Tom Ripley is a young man who gets offered $1,000 to go get a rich man's son back from Italy. Tom accepts and goes to Italy. There he meets the son, Dickie and his girlfriend Marge. He convinces Dickie and Marge that they know him. Dickie and Marge let Tom hang with them for a while. Tom is enjoying his new life. And he is starting to develop a crush on Dickie. When Dickie finally tells Tom that he's starting to annoy him, they get into a heavy fight. Eventually leading to Tom accidentally killing Dickie. For Tom to cover up the murder, he takes over Dickie's identity. And to the people who know Dickie personally, he tells them that Dickie ran away.I won't give away the ending. But you might see what I am talking about. But I would highly recommend this film.

Ripley is having too much fun, and doesn't want to stop enjoying living the good life with the money that comes with it. Apparently the ending in this one stays true to the ending that the author Highsmith had written in the book; the 1960 version is a little too whitewashed, according to wikipedia dot com.

32,paul2001sw-1,Elusive heart,6,10 September 2003,"Anthony Minghella's second film has much in common with his first, ""The English Patient"" - an all star cast, luscious production, an Italian setting, a story full of subtleties and a distancing feel that leaves the audience curiously disengaged.  Most of the cast (Jude Law and Gwynneth Paltrow especially) are excellent but Matt Damon struggles in the title role, failing to find the heart of the elusive Mr. Ripley. Ripley is both deceiver and self-deceiver, orchestrator of crimes and victim of circumstance, but Damon gives far too little away to help us understand what's really in his mind.  The film also mirrors ""The English Patient"" for its failure to communicate a sense of purpose: for all the interesting sub-themes, there's little sense of what this movie is supposed to be about, and little new is added to the mix at it drifts towards its conclusions. Though not a truly bad film, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" has a hole in its heart.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
33,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The greatest trick Mr. Ripley ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't like men.,6,31 October 2021,"'The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)' is a bit strange; it's almost like two different movies stitched together. Of course, the second half is a direct continuation of the first and wouldn't be able to exist without it, but it represents an almost total change in tone and, even, genre. This actually makes the movie seem a bit longer than it is and, at two hours and twenty minutes, it isn't exactly short anyway. The second half moves much quicker than the first primarily because it drifts further into genre movie territory, providing thrills and suspense instead of relationship drama and sexual tension. The first half of the flick is almost a romance between Damon's clearly closeted conman and Law's devil-may-care yuppie. The tension is palpable, and the flick does a good job of getting you invested in this potential love story. The second half is much closer to what I expected when I pressed play, resembling a sort of low-key thriller that actually focuses on the protagonist's penchant for identity theft. It's an enjoyable film generally, but it does suffer from the problem that its protagonist is incredibly difficult to root for. Still, it's well made on pretty much all fronts. It has an almost cruel undercurrent of palpable sadness and its characters are relatively well realised. It's also somewhat suspenseful at times and its ending is suitably frustrating. It's a good film, despite only ever being so compelling and sometimes feeling ever-so-slightly confused. 6/10.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

36,secondtake,"An enduring, classic, gorgeous, fascinating journey",10,10 January 2011,"The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)This is a truly great film. It sweeps you into another world without you even knowing it. And this other world is so beguiling and beautiful, and brimming with such elegant treachery, you wonder if it can be true. Luckily, in a way, it is not. It's the fictional invention of Patricia Highsmith, most famous until now for the book behind the Hitchcock movie, ""Strangers on a Train."" Like that movie (also utterly gripping and deceptive), this one has characters rather like you or me, or an idealized you or me (we can't all live on the coast of Italy). And someone among us is secretly sick and devious. But a first note--and this is to the lovers of other Ripley movies--Matt Damon's Ripley isn't a faithful depiction of HIghsmith's. He's less gleefully awful. And more troubled on the inside. Maybe he shouldn't have been a ""Ripley"" at all, but you need to think of this as a creative, and different, version of the many other Ripley characterizaions.And by the way, this isn't a crime film. You could be just as absorbed by the plot without any murderous edges. Director Anthony Minghella goes all out with archetypally vivid, perfect, wish-you-were-there scenes and sets. An outdoor jazz club in San Remo, open courtyards of Venice, a little village perched on rocks over the Mediterranean. The music is astonishing--mostly post-war American jazz, which one older character calls ""insolent noise"" though we know better, but also piano quartet, opera, and choral music. The light, the fluid camera (astonishing stuff), and the whole changing mise-en-scene as the movie plummets from pure joy to anger and disbelief and personal, wrenching despair.Then there are the three actors who make their characters fully complex and fleshed out, with contradictions and nuances. And if Gwyneth Paltrow's fresh idealizing innocence and Jude Law's pretty boy enthusiasms and airy selfishness are extraordinary, surely Matt Damon's interloping and bewildering cleverness takes the cake. He's so convincing you shake your head. The fact he didn't win an Oscar for this is surprising (he didn't even get nominated), but the performance is still there to enjoy. Law (who did get nominated) is also a joy to watch, a kind of idealized male most women would quickly give their right arm to be with.All three are their best here. Equally amazing are the two secondary actors with huge roles, Cate Blanchett as a charming and perplexed young traveller and Philip Seymour Hoffman as an annoying but ultimately perceptive ""ugly American."" The five of them fit their roles together like fingers in two clenched hands. When things happen you think, yes, of course, how terrible, how perfect, even if it is, as Andrew Sarris wrote at the time, ""wall to wall amorality.""Minghella, before his premature death, talked about how difficult this film was to make because of its uncompromising locations. Venice, in particular, was hell to get permission to film in, with all the open spaces he had to clear of tourists and residents, and he implied he wouldn't do it again. You get the feeling this is an exceptional film this way top to bottom. That no corners were cut, where the actors gave it something above and beyond. And where they had terrific material to start with. Minghella himself adapted Highsmith's book into a screenplay. Or I should say books--Mr. Ripley is a character in five novels, though the first is the main source here.Is it flawless? Who's to say. Others think not--mostly because they envision Ripley differently. But don't be stuck with what the books, or earlier movies, suggest. Also, the relationship between Blanchett's insecure woman and Damon's slippery self isn't quite right, perhaps, and Hoffman's role is too spectacular to be so brief, in a way. You do also wonder at the ultimate ending, if there is enough probability to the father's conclusion, so willing to put it all, bitterly, in the past. Maybe. These are quibbles on a journey that is really engrossing and a pleasure. Let it suck you in and you'll be completely happy you're there, even through the slowest , beautiful parts.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
37,inkblot11,"Although sometimes maligned as a bad career choice for Damon, it is anything but, being a totally riveting and memorable film",9,27 October 2009,"Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) works in a music hall and wishes, so, so much, that he was rich. He did attend an Ivy league school but, as a scholarship student, he was never in the limelight. A chance encounter with Mr. Greenleaf, a wealthy gentleman, results in a European vacation for Tom. This is because Mr. Greenleaf is hoping young Mr. Ripley can persuade his ex-patriot son, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and his beautiful girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) to return to the United States. But, once there, Tom gets caught up in joining Dickie and company in their ""high life"" existence, for Dickie assumes that Tom is a rich classmate he just never really knew. Only one friend (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) suspects that Mr. Ripley is not who he seems. Things get even more complicated when a boat trip taken by Dickie and Tom goes tragically awry. Will Tom's insatiable wealth-envy destroy the lives of those around him? This is a first-rate film, no matter what others have written about it. It has a sensational plot, a wonderful cast, and is gloriously lovely to look at, with its exotic locales and great costumes. As the principal cast member, Damon is excellently subdued in a most difficult and complicated role. Law, Paltrow, Hoffman, and all of the lesser cast members are great, also. Then, too, the direction is energetic and tantalizing, giving full fruition to the ingeniously sinister plot. In summary, don't skip this one, if you care about classic suspense films.

38,atlasmb,A Beautiful Film About A Complex Character,10,27 June 2018,"Isn't it often the case that filmgoers who have first seen the source material find the film adaptation lacking? I wondered who might score this film lowly and found that many of them were comparing it to the original work. It's understandable that one would compare, but it is best to judge each work on its own merits.Director Minghella has created a beautiful, complex story that stands on its own very well. ""Mr. Ripley"" evokes the fifties, the rich depths of classicism that infuse the large cities and small towns of Italy, and especially the golden warmth of summer on the Italian coast.Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley, a penniless man who inserts himself into the privileged lives of young Americans living abroad.This film was my initiation to the actor Jude Law. As such, he seemed to emerge, fully formed, as Dickie Greenleaf-one of my most memorable introductions to an actor. The wonderful cast also includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Each gives a performance equal to his or her best.The film's visuals are like a series of postcards. Each scene feels fully framed with loving attention and a masterful intention. Light is used lushly and lovingly. A colorful assortment of music-from jazz to opera-enhances each scene.The story is multi-layered-a character study of Ripley, the chameleon, and a mystery of sorts. In this drama, the plot becomes more complex, never seeming to resolve.Though the novel won the Edgar Allen Poe Award in 1956, this is a film that deserves many accolades, including its five Oscar nominations.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
39,briancham1994,A bit overrated,6,11 August 2020,"I'm a bit biased because I had to watch this film about a dozen times for high school English class, which put me off. Supposedly, analysing the director's intent was supposed to make us appreciate it a lot more, but I don't think I warmed up to it. The acting is pretty good overall but I can't say it's a masterpiece of any kind like my English teacher assured me it was. My main issue is that the protagonist is just not as sympathetic as he is intended to be, at all.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
40,didi-5,let down by Matt Damon,6,19 December 2004,"This version of Patricia Highsmith's novel was probably not needed after the excellent French version 'Plein Soleil', but here it is anyway. It shoots itself in the foot almost immediately with the casting of the irritating and talentless Matt Damon, an actor of limited expression and dodgy accent. As the complex Tom Ripley, he falls short of the interpretation that's needed.The story is basically about changing identities, dark corners, secrets, obsession, and murder. The victims - Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddie, Jude Law (setting just the right tone) as Dickie Greenleaf, and Jack Davenport as Peter Smith-Kingsley - are mainly presented as peripheral, while all revolves around Damon's yawn-inducing Ripley, self-centred, disturbed, and close to crack-up. The character should have been far more interesting to watch than he makes it.The ladies in the piece are even less well-served - Gwyneth Paltrow as Marge and Cate Blanchett as Meredith are both capable of better than they show us here.This film isn't bad but I'd still rather have the 1960 version with the beautiful photography and the stunning Alain Delon as Ripley.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
41,Floated2,Good amount of suspense,7,4 July 2016,"The Talented Mr. Ripley released in 1999 can be considered a quiet little thriller, without much of a payoff, but loaded with tons of intrigue and psychological provisions. The story, which is adapted from a famous series of novels written by Patricia Highsmith, tells of a man whose life is one big masquerade, bound by immorality and violence, but enriched by the notion that he gets to juggle different personas. Tom Ripley, who is extremely well portrayed by Matt Damon, uses his tongue-in-cheek treatment of the gift of mortality as a tool for survival, taking peoples' lives and filling them with his own. Starring in the first act, a man named Greenleaf is impressed by Ripley's style, and asks him to go to Italy to retrieve his rebellious son Dickie (Jude Law), who treats his own life like a game of chess. The tip-off: Greenleaf will pay Tom a thousand dollars to retrieve his son. But it is only moments after that we begin to realize that this Princeton student will never make it back home to his father as Ripley promises. In the end, it is well thought out and planned to make a great memorable suspense thriller.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
42,filipemanuelneto,"Deliciously dense, this movie is truly a must-see.",9,6 November 2021,"This film completely lived up to my expectations, having proved to be an authentic essay on vanity, hypocrisy, human falsehood. Based on a novel, the film brings to cinema again material that had already given rise to at least one film, in the 60s. It is, however, more than a mere remake, not making any kind of allusion to this film, which only real moviegoers will probably remember now.The script is simple to summarize, but any idea of a simplistic, easy or light story is, in my view, a great illusion: the film is far denser, psychologically rich and nuanced than this brief synopsis might imply. Tom Ripley, a young man of modest origins, will ingratiate himself with Mr. Greenleaf, an American shipbuilding industrialist who will quickly ""hire"" him to go to Italy and convince his son, Dickie, to come back and take over his place in their business. It turns out that Dickie, living hedonistic and carefree on the Italian coast, beside a beautiful woman and at his father's expense, surrounded by friends, amusements and pleasures, wants everything except to return to New York... and Ripley decides to stay too. But Ripley's envy may take him further, as the differences and incompatibilities between them grow, as does Ripley's desire to have his new friend's life.In fact, how much can we envy someone? Ripley goes to the extreme, nullifying her own self to completely embody the envied person, becoming that same person. As he says, ""I'd rather be a fake somebody than a complete nobody"". Of course, anyone could claim that the film's situation would be untenable in the long run for Ripley, with the lie coming to the fore as everyone who really knew Dickie came up and questioned his apparent disappearance... there's also, in both characters, a kind of latent homosexuality, repressed by both sides, which thickens much more their complex psychology.In addition to a good story and an excellent construction of characters and script, the film offers us an extraordinary cast. Of course, by the nature of their characters, Matt Damon and Jude Law deserve all the attention. Damon is excellent in the restrained, obsessive and cold way in which he embodied the character, but it is Law who really enchanted me, giving us one of the best works of his career: he gives his character his own charisma and an enormous passion for life that goes beyond any rich-boy hedonism. In addition to them, the film features a satisfactory, albeit faded, participation by Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett (very poorly used and hardly ever shown) and also Philip Seymour Hoffman, for whom the script reserves a particularly caricatured role, associated with bohemian life and a certain elegant loitering.On a technical level, the film has several elements of interest, starting with a very good and elegant cinematography, with good colors, good light, and the intelligent use of the beauty of the Mediterranean landscapes where the film was shot. In fact, the film manages to make even us, the audience, wish for ourselves the carefree life of sun, sea and music that Dickie Greenleaf chose for himself, and understand very well how Ripley allowed herself to be seduced and fascinated by it all... of course, none of us would do what he ended up doing, but we almost supported the character. The film is set in the 50s, and gives us a smell of that time and that environment through clothes, cars and other props, such as the simple fact that almost everyone smokes, a habit still considered elegant at that time. Jazz is an almost ubiquitous element in the film and the soundtrack makes good use of it, but I regret that the film has not also known how to take advantage of some of the best Italian songs... I remember that the Italian song of the 50s and 60s is considered by many to be the best of music in this country, with names like Emílio Pericoli, Mina Mazzini or Ornella Vanoni, to name a few.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
43,dfranzen70,"Ripley intriguing, ambiguous, and magnificent",9,15 July 2000,"Patricia Highsmith's novel about a chameleonlike psychopath in the Mediterranean becomes a sparkling, taut thriller in the hands of director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient). Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a pasty-white hanger-on who is asked by the prominent father of Dickie, a rich kid, (Jude Law) to travel to Europe and convince his erstwhile son to come home.Ripley goes, of course, and although his ghostly visage stands out rather abruptly on the golden beaches of Italy, he soon ingratiates himself with Dickie and his glamorous buddies. Well wouldn't you know it! He's having so much darn much fun, living his own vida loca and all, that he doesn't want to come back to the States with Dickie. But hold on! Dickie suddenly doesn't want Tom hanging around so much. Oh, and Tom's falling for Dickie's gorgeous girlfriend Marge (the sumptuous Gwyneth Paltrow), and he's also finding out more about Dickie than he wanted to know.How much you enjoy this film does not depend on how much you identify with Tom Ripley. There's certainly a lot more to him than meets the eye, and this is evident from the very first scene. He's a mysterious, ambiguous character - in more ways than one. In fact, the most compelling aspect of this movie is that you never truly know Tom Ripley's motivation. You don't know what makes him tick. You don't know, above all, what in the world he's going to do next. That's not an easy feat for a screenwriter to accomplish, but Minghella (who adapted the novel) does just that. I really was on the edge of my seat wondering where the story was going to end up. That's a major plus in this day of carbon-copy scripts.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
44,drqshadow-reviews,"A Plot of Greed, Adoration, Rejection... and Tragedy",8,10 October 2017,"A small-scale imposter / con man, making the rounds in 1950s New York, gets caught up in something much greater than his usual scam and decides to let it ride, if just to see where he winds up. In this case the answer is Italy, gorgeous vestige of the old world with just a few hints of the modern one, where he's tasked with convincing a flippant trust funder to return from a perpetual, fortune-draining holiday. That mission quickly goes by the wayside, just as soon as he realizes how much easier life is in the lap of luxury, and he merely exacerbates said money-letting as the wealthy playboy's new wingman. When things take a turn for the messy, though, his welcome worn thin and nothing to show for it but bittersweet memories, a panicked string of responses sends the entire comfortable lifestyle into a tailspin. At its root, Ripley is an example of how fear and rejection can press a normally smart, affable person over the brink into monstrosity, a surprise considering the playful tone of the first act. Matt Damon, still fresh from his breakout in 1997's Good Will Hunting, shows great versatility in the leading role (essential for such a complicated character), smoothly masking that twitch in his eye from all but the viewing audience. It's one of those films where you'll feel wrong about your rooting interest, knowing all along that the guy absolutely does not deserve a happy ending, with the final moments serving as your comeuppance.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
45,MBunge,Exquisite villainy,8,31 December 2010,"This is an exquisite film about villainy that pushes heroism off the stage and gives Matt Damon the space to demonstrate why he's had a much more successful acting career than Ben Affleck. Damon creates a character who then recreates himself as another person and infuses it all with an emotional directness from which you can't look away.Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a strange young man living a strange life in late 1950s New York City. Tom is full of great ability and possesses tremendous discipline, enough to be a professional-level pianist. Yet, he's nothing more than a men's room attendant at an opera house and lives in a rundown basement apartment. There's a void inside Tom that he tries to cover up with lies and mimicry but he always knows it's there and it fills him with a crippling self-loathing that renders Tom Ripley a timid bystander to his own life.By chance, Tom meets and impresses the wealthy Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn), who hires Tom as an emissary to his spoiled and irresolute son. Tom, who's passed himself off as a Princeton classmate of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), is supposed to go to Italy and talk Dickie into returning to New York. When Tom meets Dickie and his beautiful fiancée Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), he settles on a very different agenda. He ingratiates himself into Dickie and Marge's expatriate lives, becoming the poor country mouse that only wants to be near the more feline Dickie. Dickie Greenleaf is everything that Tom Ripley has ever wanted to be. For a while, Dickie enjoys having a sidekick who's so out of place in his world of the idle rich. While Tom looks like an accountant for the FBI and acts like a needy and nervous waiter who's standing at your table, listening to your conversation, Dickie shines like the Sun. And like the Sun, the warmth of his attention can be glorious and then terribly cold when it's gone. But when Dickie decides he's had enough of his country mouse, that violently launches Tom on a voyage of shared identities that seems to give him everything he's ever wantedonly to have it all slip away.The Talented Mr. Ripley focuses on a variety of human evil that you don't see much in stories. Tom isn't crazy or malevolent or anything that you'd consider all that bad. He's just broken inside and tries to fix that by grafting himself onto other people. It's not emotionally healthy, but it's not something that would necessarily lead to evil. What sets Tom down a dark road is actually the darker nature of Dickie. Without Dickie pushing him in the wrong direction, Tom might never have been more than a clingy non-entity who drifts through a life of unacknowledged desperation. This movie treats evil not as a singular drive, but as the unfortunate product of the wrong people coming together at the wrong time. Tom ends up doing many awful things. However, he likely wouldn't have done any of it if Dickie hadn't provoked him into that first wrong step.Damon's performance is almost spellbinding and Jude Law isn't far behind. These are two young actors letting their talent expand out into every nook and cranny of their roles. Gwyneth Paltrow's character is less active. Marge functions in the story as a reflection of the audience's view of Tom and Dickie and how it changes throughout the story. When Marge finally recognizes Tom's true nature, Paltrow fills her with the sort of overwhelming terror that a thousand crappy slasher flicks have tried and failed to ignite.Binding those performances together is a smartly written script that strings a thread of realism throughout The Talented Mr. Ripley and prevents it from spinning into melodrama. Plans are hatched and then come undone, not because of one-in-a-million coincidences but because of the sort of mistakes people can't help making.If you haven't already seen it, make an effort to watch this movie. It'll only disappoint you if you want it to be dumber than what it is.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The action starts in the second half. An ingenious script keeps the gag going as the plot gets darker.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
47,Lechuguilla,Worth Watching But Inferior To The Original,6,17 November 2014,"Adapted from the Patricia Highsmith novel, this film details the adventures of twenty-something Tom Ripley, a New York City nobody who gets a chance to travel to Italy to persuade a playboy to return to his American roots. And when opportunity knocks, Ripley opens the door. This film is an expensive, splashy Hollywood production with big name stars, and shot in multiple locations in Italy. Naturally, the scenery is enthralling.The story is very good, but the plot here is mediocre. The rationale for multiple plot points is lost on me. Why did Ripley feel the need to learn jazz before leaving New York? What was the point of the lady who drowned in the water? Why was the Meredith character included, apart from giving Ripley more headaches with his identity crisis? The film was about thirty minutes too long. And some of these vague plot points could have been zapped.Casting and acting are okay, except for Matt Damon who plays the lead character. I never did see Tom Ripley; all I saw was Matt Damon. See Matt smile; see Matt move his lips; see Matt smile and move his lips again. Was Damon not interested in his role? Probably the best performances were Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchett, both in support roles.I had already seen ""Purple Noon"" (1960), the first version of the Ripley story. Maybe because I have such a fond memory of ""Purple Noon"", I'm a bit biased against this 1999 version. But ""Purple Noon"" had better casting and plot. The visuals in both films are equally good.Despite the casting of Matt Damon and the mediocre plot, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is still worth watching, owing mostly to the original concept and story from the source material.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

50,noralee,Beautiful Looking but Unconvincing Adaptation,5,29 November 2005,"My viewing of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" was biased by having seen another movie based on the same Patricia Highsmith book, Rene Clement's ""Purple Noon (Plein soleil)"" with a young, very gorgeous Alain Delon as Ripley.Critics have said the American version is actually closer to the book, but the French version is notable for being the first noir film in blinding sun. Rather than the homosexual underpinning of the book (reviewers have said) and American version, the French had more of a menage a trois, with Delon seducing the girlfriend into forgetting where her boyfriend might be -- and his come uppance only coming in the last seconds of the movie with a visual revelation.Jude Law plays a very similar character as he did in ""Gattaca,"" where Ethan Hawke was the working class guy who takes over his golden life.Others disagree with me, but whereas the Alain Delon character did seem casually amoral, Matt Damon seems more motivated by being in the closet, or as he calls it being in the basement, as being threatened with being found out about his identity included his homosexuality. Friends of mine commented that Damon wasn't charming enough, but I think it was the script more than him.The last quarter of the movie didn't quite work for me, and the ending seemed abrupt, and poor Gwyneth Paltrow just seemed shrill by the end.The settings and cinematography are certainly gorgeous, making the violence startlingly out of place.(originally written 1/9/2000)",The Talented Mr. Ripley

""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a well-constructed thriller, that has an increasingly complicated (yet mostly improbable) plot, but the characterizations are weak and the performances (Oscar-nominated Jude Law included) are stilted.

Matt Damon provides a fantastic performance as Tom Ripley, along with some outstanding performances from the supporting cast, specifically Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. The film is beautifully shot, with some great set pieces, and costumes all throughout. The film feels rather grounded, and not overdramatic, which is nice for the topics it deals with, and is also provided with, for the most part, a rather stellar script. The film is gloriously full of music from the time and it uses it well, along with a great score itself. The film can be a bit slow at times, and even more so, feels it can be about 10-15 mins shorter, but in the end, The Talented Mr. Ripley proves to be more than an interesting and engaging slow burn thriller to watch and proves to be quite rewatchable as well.

Even Blanchett and Paltrow are good, which is impressive due to how small their roles are.The story follows a man with a skill for fitting in, fretting close to people and his journey from a New York slum to beautiful Italy. There is a bit of an issue of who to root for here as there's not really a ""good guy"" so to speak but still it's entertaining to watch everything play out.In the end, this was an engaging romp.

57,Spleen,"Good, old-fashioned treat",9,21 July 2000,"I'll get my two complaints out of the way early.  The opening few minutes of the film hardly suggest that the next two hours will be as engrossing and - well, as romantic, in the old sense of the word - as they are.  We're given too much information too haphazardly.  We don't know what details to listen and watch for; and since the opening New York scenes are really just exposition, they ought to have been EITHER clearer, OR more fun to watch. (And I really HATE the modern practise of running the opening credits over the opening footage.  Opening credits come BEFORE the movie.  Got it?  I know, I know: Minghella is only doing what everyone else is doing.  All the same he shouldn't do it.)Everything is forgiven when we arrive in Italy.  The next two hours fly by.Then it ends much too suddenly.  (Spoiler ahead - skip this paragraph if you don't know about the film's final scene.)  I could easily have stood to watch another twenty minutes of footage, which would have been more than enough to turn the ending into a more satisfactory one.  The film doesn't end with Tom confessing, or getting caught, or escaping from the nets of law and suspicion once and for all - it's not clear which of these we hope to happen, and it would be nice to find out - or even with a sample of the kind of life he must now lead.  It ends IMMEDIATELY after another murder. Murders have consequences.  SOMETHING must happen next; but what?  In murdering Peter has Tom finally woven the noose around his neck, or will he manage to get away with it?  Is it POSSIBLE for him to get away with it?  Or could it even be laughably easy for him to get away with it?  Will his life after the murder be any worse than it was before?  We aren't told; we aren't even given the means to work these things out.  After 139 minutes it's simply not fair to leave us in mid-air.But oh, what a good story it is apart from this!  How wonderfully it's filmed!  Every part of Italy we see is just gorgeous; I think I'D be willing to kill just to stay there.  No, on reflection, I wouldn't, but you know what I mean.Tom Ripley is a bigger rat than most of us could manage to be, yet we never quite desert him in our minds.  This despite the fact that we are periodically reminded how he CONTINUES to behave badly.  Madge is an adorable person (even those who have never liked Gwyneth Paltrow's characters will like this one, I think), yet Ripley sticks knife after knife into her, not really meaning to, but not really caring, either.  Every so often she shows up and we realise just how badly Ripley is behaving.  And she's not a passive Madama Butterfly character who just irritates us despite her legitimate claims to our sympathy, either.  She only seems like Madama Butterfly when she's away.  When she appears again we kick ourselves for having been insensitive.  I found myself silently willing Ripley's lips to move so as to voice a confession.Apart from that little insecurity at the beginning and a premature end I'm unable to find fault.  Even the music is good - possibly because most of it is source music NOT written by Gabriel Yared, but even the stuff that IS written by him is good enough.  Great title, too.  ""Talented"" is just the word for Mr. Ripley: it's accurate, and the nicest thing that we can say about him if we're in a mood to be kind, which, strangely, we are.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

61,eric262003,Great Score With Some Unique Features To An Overrated Film,6,9 April 2017,"Off my back the musical backgrounds to ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is really ear-friendly thanks to the great composer Gabriel Yared. The score is very reminiscent to the classic scores from the old Alfred Hitchcock films that Bernard Hermann contributed to like ""Vertigo"", ""North By Northwest"", and the always crowd-pleasing ""Psycho"". The opening titles has that feeling like Hitchcock as the picture slowly materializes into a stream of different colours. However, the film falls flat in trying to be a modern-day Hitchcock film, because the Master of Suspense would never consider making something so disjointed and muddled.Under the direction of Anthony Minghella who directed the riveting ghost romance ""Truly Madly Deeply"" and the overlong and mundane ""The English Patient"", which won him an Oscar in hopes to repeat himself here as well being that this film is also within the 2 hour and 30 minute range. That's five times longer than Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" with the difference being that Hitchcock's film starts slow and the intensity builds up as the film progresses. Minghella's film fizzles as it goes along and ends without any kind of logic once the credits roll.Set in the 1950's, Matt Damon stars as Tom Ripley, a low-income musician who gets mistaken for a Princeton graduate. When approached by a wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn), he's assigned to go to Italy to bring his son Dickie (Jude Law) back home. Dickie is enjoying the life there with his wife Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow). Ripley get adjusted to this lifestyle and does everything he can to nurture it as much as possible. Damon and Paltrow have been good in many films, but here, they seem to be streaming along with very little complexity. Jude Law seems type-cast in roles he's played before like ""In the Garden of Good and Evil"" and ""Wilde"". The real standout performances are by Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman, but they're just fillers and it saddens me to see how underused they were.I went to see the film because I was fascinated by the wonderful novel it was based on by Patricia Highsmith who also is known for her book ""Strangers on a Train"". The movie looks good when wrapping up around the two hour mark, but instead we're forced down out throats with a unnecessary scene by dawning Ripley's homosexual urges which before then was only pondered upon. The gay subtext was only meant to be a mystery and should never have been revealed. This is just another fine line of Hollywood clichés of gay serial killers which to this point has become homophobic and inexcusable.On the positive side of this movie, it's great to see the legendary Walter Murch in charge of the sound design and the editing. He's done plenty of collaborations of some of the biggest films in cinema including ""The Godfather Trilogy"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""The English Patient"". His specialty is cutting a scene with its sound to follow and it proves effectively in this suspenseful drama. It's probably the best thing about this movie that's worthy of a second look.The first hour of the movie was incredible and I enjoyed it very well. Still I have my doubts if its highly recommendable. It could be to some extent, however I get better satisfaction watching classic suspense films like ""North By Northwest"" and the original incarnation of this film Rene Clement's ""Purple Noon"".",The Talented Mr. Ripley
62,DeeNine-2,Excellent interpretation of the Highsmith mystery classic,9,2 November 2001,"It's interesting to compare director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella's interpretation with the source material, mystery novelist Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel of the same name. That novel was an intense but somewhat euphemistic psycho/sexual study of a sociopath of ambiguous sexuality done as a third-person narrative from a limited point of view (Ripley's). As such we were forced to identify with Highsmith's antihero, all the better to set us up for her ironic and daring 'resolution.' Minghella has changed the ending, but without changing its spirit. He has Ripley committing an additional murder while throwing in a character not in the novel, Cate Blanchett's Meredith Logue. Miss Logue serves two purposes, one, she helps unravel the plot and two, she helps to objectify Tom Ripley's ambivalent sexual nature.The simplistic question, is Ripley gay? is not answered in the Highsmith novel. But Minghella, by adding the bathtub scene with Dickie and the scene aboard ship with the clearly gay Peter Smith-Kingsley, decides that Ripley is indeed gay. Nonetheless the psychological heart of the story, that of a man who loathes himself so much that he can only love himself by assuming the identity of another man whom he admires, is left intact. Minghella's script and direction remain true to the spirit and broad form of the novel, while improving on the dramatic quality of the story. (I don't think most movie audiences would have the patience for Highsmith's more leisurely exposition.)Some other changes by Minghella include making Dickie's passion jazz music instead of painting, and emphasizing the rich boy/poor boy dichotomy (somewhat reminiscent of the chasm in The Great Gatsby) by making Dickie a Princeton grad and Tom a piano-playing kid who had a menial job at the university. In the book Dickie and Tom actually knew one another before Europe, while Minghella has Tom pretend that Dickie and he had previously met. Also in the book Marge Sherwood's character is almost stupid. In the movie she is intelligent and insightful. Dickie loves her and they are to be married. In the book she is just a girlfriend. The success of this movie in large part is due to Minghella's ability to translate the novel to the screen, but also because of a very superior cast.Matt Damon as the murderous Mr. Ripley is creepy and vulnerable and entirely believable. Jude Law as the rich and spoiled, but likable Dickie Greenleaf, is outstanding. He is an actor of charisma and subtlety. Gwyneth Paltrow does a good job in a somewhat limited role as Marge Sherwood. Cate Blanchett, whom you may recall from her outstanding work in Elizabeth (1998) is particularly good as the straight-laced and somewhat inhibited Meredith Logue who has designs on Tom Ripley's morally corrupted heart (although she thinks he's Dickie Greenleaf). She, more than anyone conveys the look and feel of the fifties. And Phillip Seymour Hoffman, whom I recall from his small part as Lester Bangs, the cynical rock critic in Almost Famous (2000), is superb as Dickie's somewhat boorish friend, Freddie Miles.In some ways this is better than the book. (And in some ways it isn't, of course.) Minghella, who brought Michael Ondaatje's difficult novel, The English Patient, to the screen, proves once again that he knows the difference between a novel and a screenplay and how to translate the one into the other without losing the essence of the original. Incidentally, the spiffy line spoken by James Rebhorn as Dickie's father, Herbert Greenleaf, 'People say you can't choose your parents, but you know you can't choose your children either,' is not in the book (nor in Bartlett's Quotations) and so I presume was penned by Minghella.Another very good movie version of the Highsmith novel is the Hitchcock-like Plein Soleil ('Purple Moon') released in 1960 from French director Rene Clement.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

63,sme_no_densetsu,An underrated thriller with a hard to ignore flaw,8,3 December 2008,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", based on the novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith, centres around a young man sent to Italy for the purpose of convincing a rich man's son to return home. Instead, he befriends him and begins to enjoy his new lifestyle so much that he'll go to great lengths to preserve it, perhaps even resorting to murder.The cast is well-assembled with Matt Damon and Jude Law being the standouts. That being said, I find it somewhat difficult to believe Law as an American and extremely difficult to believe Damon as a master of impersonation. Nevertheless, their performances are excellent. Also notable in a small role is Philip Seymour Hoffman.Anthony Minghella's script makes for a fine thriller and his direction is impeccable. The film's entire look is outstanding with beautiful locations and excellent cinematography creating a vibrant picture of 1950's Italy. The score is also above average and was honored with an Academy Award nomination.In the end, though, the film's main stumbling block is the suspension of belief required in order to buy Matt Damon as a master impersonator who could pass for Jude Law. If you can handle that then you'll be able to focus on the finer points of the film.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
64,Howlin Wolf,Shows what Minghella can do when he turns his hand to a script with a little tension in it...,9,11 October 2002,"My summary derives from the fact that I HATED ""The English Patient"".  For a movie that won so many Oscars, the only things that saved Minghella's earlier effort from being a complete dud in my eyes were the production design and the performances.  (That should save you from having to read the review I'm writing next...  :-) )  ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" shares the scant virtues of ""The English Patient"", but has a whole lot more qualities besides with which to pique your interest.   It's another 'long' film like ""EP"", but the script seems a whole lot tighter, and each and every one of the supporting characters MATTER in ""Ripley"", even the part played by Cate Blanchett, who really isn't on screen for very long at all.  It feels like it has something to say about the darker elements of the human condition, rather than coming off like a bloated ""Milk Tray"" advert, a la ""EP"".  Oh, and it leaves you thinking at the end, as opposed to asleep... !   Seriously, seek this out if you haven't already, and get a taste of just HOW talented Minghella is when he gets hold of material with some 'snap' in it...  Didn't mean to turn this review into an attack on another film, but they really are polar opposites; and it galls me that the director got so much acclaim for one, and yet not enough for this...",The Talented Mr. Ripley
65,Screen_Blitz,"Matt Damon is solid as the eponymous character, and the fascinating execution of this complex tale really works",7,24 March 2017,"Anthony Minghella's tale of corruption and deceit feels like a movie made during the Golden Age of Hollywood. With 1950s Europe serving as the backdrop of the story, and the classical jazz soundtrack playing throughout the entirety, it is hard not to feel the nostalgia of the cinema's classical era roaming through this psychological thriller. Minghella takes from the pages of Patricia Highsmith's novel of the same name to orchestrate a compelling, if somewhat flawed tale of a man consumed by corruption and deceit when the things make a horribly wrong turn. The versatile actor masked behind the titular character is Matt Damon who made a household name for himself when it starred with Robin Williams as the eponymous character in 'Good Will Hunting'. What comes about this actor's immersive talent is a performance that works like a charm. Set in the 1950s, this film stars Matt Damon as Tom Ripley, a Manhattan pianist who's approached by Herbert Greenleaf (played by James Rehborn) who believes Ripley is a graduate from Princeton University, seeing a Princeton badge on his tuxedo. He recruits him on a mission to Italy and finds his son Dickie (played by Jude Law), a spoiled millionaire and graduate of Princeton, and persuade him to return home to the U.S. Upon arrival, Ripley comes face-to-face with Dickie and his fiancée Marge (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and almost immediately befriends. After a few nights of drinking and jazz concerts, his errand becomes difficult when Dickie learns of his intentions. When the things suddenly go horribly wrong, Ripley takes extreme measures to carry out the mission while avoiding the suspicion of Dickie's friend Freddie Miles (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman).This film shows clear evidence that Anthony Minghella knows how to craft a fascinating story, even when it falls victim to a lethargic pace. The film spends an almost overwhelming amount of time to establish its premise before the plot finally kicks into gear. Although the setup pays off quite well, the pacing is enough to alienate viewers who are often accustomed to more modern-esque storytelling. But when the plot finally lights its candle, that is when the story generates a wheelhouse of unexpected twists and surprises that elevates the lead character's development. The title character's disintegration of his moral compass becomes the driving force of the story, and becomes the main source of surprises as he goes to shocking measures to deceive everyone into the person he is not. It takes a special actor like Matt Damon to effectively portray the wicked and complex nature of the lead character. His chemistry with Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow works fantastically, especially with their performances serving a great support. Law gives a fantastic portrayal as the spoiled, larger-than-life millionaire who wants nothing more than to a luxurious lifestyle. Phillip Seymour and Cate Blanchett also make a charming on screen presence, nothing out of the ordinary. In the account of visual imagery, the production design of 1950s Italy is utter eye candy and serves as an absorbing backdrop of the story's historical era. The jazz music, the vintage interior design of the Italian households both serve the film is sweet visual treat.The Talented Mr. Ripley is a fine piece of work conducted by Anthony Minghella with a performance by Matt Damon that shines with passion, and a beautifully executed story that tackles on the complexities of its startling eponymous character. Minghella's take on this dark, but fascinating story does not come out its flaws nor does it break the boundaries of any cinematic element, it is finely crafted piece of work that can some can somewhat admire.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
66,leftbanker-1,Top Notch Modern Classic,10,21 November 2020,"Perhaps my favorite crime novel. Period.I read this in English so long ago I could barely remember a single thing about it except that the movie deviated from the novel on several important points. I remember that although I enjoyed the film, I was puzzled as to why Anthony Minghella made these important changes in his movie adaptation (how could Ripley be a good classical pianist in one scene and then a washroom attendant in the next?). I just finished reading the book again, this time in Spanish. It was a total blast to read. I spent three hours in a café last night ripping through the final chapters. I'm thankful for Spain's recent smoking ban or I would have made some serious inroads with my second-hand smoke cancer.Tom Ripley is a thorough creep. He's a petty thief, a swindler, and cold-blooded murderer, yet I was rooting for him to get away with his horrible sins. Is this what the author intended, or am I damaged goods? Perhaps it has something to do with my present state of mind of thinking that America and the rest of the world is being destroyed by the ultra-rich elite. Is the world really worse off without douche bags like Freddy Miles?In the end, the prol Tom Ripley was just stronger and more adaptable than the rich folks in his new environment, like an invasive species. If only Tom Ripley had seen The Sopranos he could have made his life easier. Instead of his clumsy manner of corpse disposal he should have copied how Tony Soprano got rid of his little Ralf Cifaretto problem.I suppose the whole point to Mr. Ripley is that he enjoys being hunted. He enjoys being oh-so-close to disaster. The tension is so great at times that you feel the need to hang on to something as you tear through the pages.What the novel is really about is stealing someone's life. To do this, Tom must take away the life of the person who currently inhabits that life. This point isn't driven home in the novel, but it wasn't like Dickie was doing much with his life. Once cozily situated in this new life, Tom seems to blossom like a wildflower. Just as he overpowered Dickie, he outsmarts everyone trying to interfere with his new life. He deals with Marge quite cruelly, telling her that Dickie has simply moved to Rome. He makes short work of Freddie Miles. He discards the body with such casualness that it's almost like he is inviting the police scrutiny just to spice up his life. It certainly spiced up the novel.Plein Soleil vs The Talented Mr. RipleyI saw that a friend of mine was reading a book by Patricia Highsmith with the title En Pleno Sol. He described what he had read thus far and I thought that perhaps it was another in the Mr. Ripley series but after reading the first page I learned that this is another title for El Talento de Mr. Ripley which I had just finished in Spanish. It is common to change titles of translated books with different publications or different translations but I wondered how they came upon this odd variation of the original title.On the back cover of this edition I learned about the French film Plein Soleil (1960) directed by René Clément and staring Alain Delon in the role of Tom Ripley. If you think this French title is odd (it means ""full sun"") the English title of the movie is Purple Noon so everyone is guilty of massacring titles in translation. I loved the book, both when I read it as a very young man in English, and even more the second time around in Spanish. I also enjoyed the movie The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) directed by Anthony Minghella.The French movie isn't bad, but I had some problems with it. Four minutes of precious movie time is spent showing how Ripley forges Dickie's passport and signature when the book dealt with this matter in about two brief sentences. He simply forged the signature and used Dickie's passport without any alterations. There's another precious minute lost showing Ripley wandering around the market in Naples while waiting for Marge to write a letter to Dickie who Tom has already eliminated- yet another scene of the director's imagination and not from the book. Was he out to make a crime thriller or a travelogue of scenic southern Italy?Minghella copied directly from the French film. A case in point is when Freddy goes to visit Dickie only to find Tom living in the apartment. He leaves and then Tom is betrayed by the signora who sees him from a few flights below on the stairwell. In the book she simply mentions to Freddy as he is leaving that Signor Greenleaf had not left the apartment that day, which is why Freddy returns and is subsequently murdered by Tom. Minghella copies another scene from Clément when Dickie, Tom, and Marge are on the boat and Dickie and Marge have sex in the cabin below while Tom fumes on the deck above. In the book Marge and Dickie weren't really even lovers.The French movie is so divorced from the book that it reminds me of the children's game of telephone where a story is told in the ear of the person sitting next to you and passed around until the last person. Why bother to base a film on a great book if you are going to make such radical changes? I suppose that if you separate the film completely from the novel it could actually be decent; the trouble is that I actually read the book. The Talented Mr. Ripley is one of the best crime novels of the 20th century so it puzzles me that anyone would stray so far from it when making a film adaptation. My biggest complaint with Plein Soleil is that there isn't anything in the way of character development.This wasn't a problem with the Minghella version. As was the case with the novel, I had a perverse desire to see Tom get away with his theft of Dickie's life. I grew to detest the character of Freddy Miles (played superbly by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the film) that I practically cheered when he was brained with a statuette and summarily tossed along the roadside. There was nothing in the way of tension in the French version while in the novel and the modern remake you are on the edge of your seat for most of the ride.
It's not as if Minghella was incredibly faithful to the novel but he wasn't too off-the-mark. He took the whole homosexuality thing and ran with it whereas Highsmith only hinted at in the novel. Times change and it's the director's movie but I would have to fault Minghella most of the times his story drifted too far from the book. When Tom kills Dickie in the book it is completely premeditated, but in the movie it is almost an accident, a crime of high passion (in the French version it was something out of a Freddy Kruger movie).If you haven't read the book already, I highly recommend it. It beats the hell out of both films.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
67,Maciste_Brother,Read the book!,3,22 November 2000,"The book is great. It's one of my favorite books ever. The film, on the other hand, is amazingly insipid and bad! When I heard Damon would play Ripley, I knew this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be this bad. The actors go around and act very showy. Except for Law (and even he is guilty of some showy acting), all the actors here are near amateurish. Speaking Italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting. Damon is miscast. He's way too stiff for a character that's supposed to be a chameleon. Paltrow is forgettable and Hoffman plays yet another effeminate slimy character. Talk about typecasting.What's really unforgivable about the script (written by the overrated director) is that it completely forgoes every subtle details from the book and comes up with many of its own, and none of them work! The addition of the Jazz music stuff is totally WRONG! I guess Minghella's idea of Italy in the late 50s, early 60s is clouded with images of Chet Baker roaming the Italian countryside and spreading amore. Yep, Minghella is a true visionary. The film is so bleeding obvious. That silly scene when Ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors. Very laughable. Yes, we get the point!!! Every point or detail comes across a mile away, so much so that the film might give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers. We know, for example, that the Blanchett character, introduced at the beginning of the movie, will return later on only complicate things. And the soundtrack, at times, is totally inappropriate. Whimsical when it shouldn't be. The film goes on for too long and in all sorts of pointless directions. There are too many boring characters populating the landscape (many that weren't in the book). This film is bad! Really bad!Apparently, Minghella's son told his father that the Ripley novel was his favorite. Mr. Minghella then proceeded to direct it as a favor of sorts to his son. Well, the director did achieve what he set out to do: Talented Mr. Ripley, with its Hitchcock aspirations, is a film strictly made for 12 year olds!",The Talented Mr. Ripley
68,Terrell-4,"Minghella gives us the sad boy who wets his pants, not the charming snake that swallows the little white mouse",6,14 March 2009,"Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley suffers badly from that all-too-common condition, auteur's bloat. It's not just that the young, charming, amoral and murderous Tom Ripley has been turned into a corn-fed young man with tragic flaws. That wouldn't necessarily be a problem. Although those who love Patricia Highsmith's unadulterated protagonist might fuss, changing things is inherent in bringing books to movies. A different take on a character can be interesting. The problem is that Minghella takes nearly two-and- a-half hours to tell Tom's story. Just about 139 minutes to be more exact. We learn far more about Tom's background than we need - how he met his prey's father and got to Europe, his homoeroticism, his soul searching, his yearning. (Note to Minghella: Tom Ripley doesn't have a soul; that's one of the reason's he's so fascinating.) Minghella piles on miles of beautiful tourist scenery, throws in a new, major character, and in general just uses too much time. Once a director makes a couple of prestigious hits, establishes his name, maybe wins an Oscar, attracts big stars who want to work with him, and does his own writing, a key quality is usually lost. That's the ability of someone to say to him, ""Buddy, here's your budget. Exceed it and we'll take the picture away from you"" and ""Hey, kid, if you don't give us a finished cut that comes in at under 100 minutes, you lose the final edit."" With Minghella's more sympathetic and less interesting Tom, we have a young man whose tragic flaws lead to murder and whose regrets lead to angst. Tom (Matt Damon) wants the good things in life. He's poor but is a natural chameleon and a willing opportunist. When he attaches himself to the wealthy Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), life is good. When Dickie gets tired of him, Tom knows life will no longer be good. He knows he most likely can become Dickie. So he takes steps to do just that. Exit Dickie. Now Tom is in a cat and mouse adventure, moving faster and faster to protect himself and his investment in this new, lovely life of leisure. There's Dickie's on-and-off fiancée, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) to deal with, Dickie's old pal Freddie Miles (Philip Seymore Hoffman) to deal with, a new character Minghella decided to layer into the story (an irritatingly mannered Meredith Logue played by Cate Blanchett) to deal with and another young man who may wish he'd never met Tom. With frantic improvisation, some wooing, some boyish charm, an additional murder or two and a bout of sobbing regret, Tom Ripley does what he must. Unfortunately, Minghella has taken a charmingly conscience-free murder story and tried to turn it into meaningful literature. Matt Damon does a fine job as Anthony Minghella's version of Tom Ripley, but don't expect the scheming, mooching, self-centered and charming Tom Ripley of either Highsmith's creation or of the Tom Ripley played by Alain Delon in Rene Clement's version of the story, Purple Noon (Plein Soleil). In a bit of nasty uneasiness, Highsmith, Minghella and Clement all turn us into observers who are rooting for Tom's success, but Clement manages to do this while telling Tom's story in 30 fewer minutes that Minghella needs. Minghella, however, also wants us to ""understand"" Tom. All we really need is to sit back and enjoy his attitude and his crimes. For fans of Tom Ripley, there's the excellent (except for the cop-out ending) Purple Noon, plus two movies made from Highsmith's Ripley's Game. The American Friend features the unlikely Dennis Hopper as Tom. Ripley's Game gives us Tom played skillfully by John Malkovich. Ripley's Game is a first-rate, queasy movie.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
69,baumer,To live vicariously through someone else,8,2 February 2000,"Warning, does contain spoilers.I think we have all done it or at least wanted to.  To live vicariously through someone else, that is.  We see movie stars or musicians that have a lifestyle that we want.  Or it could just be a friend or someone that you know.  Maybe that person has a car that you like or they have a beautiful spouse.  It could be any number of things really but the point is that in some point in our lives I think we have all lived in the shoes of someones else.  Envy, sure that is a word that leads to what vicariousness becomes. 
In this film, Tom Ripley has the ultimate opportunity and unlike most of us, he plans to make the most of it.  To me that is what is the most intriguing part of the film.  The opportunity is there and instead of succumbing to reality, Tom Ripley, in an Oscar worthy performance by Matt Damon, takes that opportunity and abuses it.I think by now we all know the story.  Tom Ripley is asked by Mr. Greenleaf to go to Italy and persuade his son to come home.  Dickie, his son is there with his fiancee Marge and he really isn't doing much with his life but spending money and living the life of a rich playboy.  Once there, Tom gets swallowed into the lifestyle and doesn't want to get out of it.Matt Damon plays The Talented Mr. Ripley so that we like him.  That is a difficult task since ultimately what Ripley is and what he becomes is a murderer, extortionist and really not a very likable character.  But in some strange way, we do like him.  We find ourselves rooting for him.  Maybe it's because he has so much charm and so much character that, inspite of our morals, we want him to have the life that he wants.  Whatever the reason we can't help ourselves but to root for him.  I am not going to get into the rest of the film too much.  There is an excellent review of the film perhaps just a few below mine by a great reviewer in the IMDb named M.A. Rogers.  That review captures the essence of the film completely.  But I will just say that if you do see this film, pay close attention to Matt Damon.  Feel how he becomes Tom Ripley.  You can sense his pain, his fear, his excitement and his relief.  This is one of the best performances of the year and I really think he deserves an Oscar nod. 
The Talented Mr. Ripley is one of the best films of the year and if you can sit through it's more than two hour length, then you will be rewarded with a fantastic film.  I loved it for all that it is but especially for what Matt Damon does with his character.  This is what film making and acting is all about.  This should be a must see for serious film fans.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
70,kevin c,Ripping Ripley,8,28 February 2000,"This is a quality thriller, with tones of Hitchcock. It oozes class from the stunning opening titles, jazz score and beautiful scenery. Jude Law is excellent. You're charmed by him, and then equally repelled as he loses interest in Ripley et al. Matt Damon captures the faceless Ripley well, and you're hooked to see how he's going to avoid being exposed. How was this overlooked for tosh like 'The Green Mile'?",The Talented Mr. Ripley
71,mattymatt4ever,A splendid masterpiece!,9,27 January 2002,"This is one of the best thrillers ever made!  The cinematography alone is breathtaking.  The performances are brilliant.  Matt Damon delivers his greatest performance; one that should languish any potential of him becoming just another Hollywood pretty boy.  He had to lose weight, making him virtually anhorexic, for the role so obviously he was up to the challenge. And Damon brings such a subtle creepiness to the character of Tom Ripley. Jude Law is also terrific, in a relatively small role.  His American accent is thoroughly convincing.  Also worth mentioning is Cate Blanchett in another relatively small role.  She also had to fake an American accent, which she did well this time--she screwed up in ""Pushing Tin.""   
The score is memorable and perfectly contributes to the suspense.  The music, the cinematography and the acting all combine to create some truly bone-chilling scenes.  As Roger Ebert said, this is the kind of film that would make Alfred Hitchcock proud.  Some may consider the film slow and dragging.  Even though the movie's long, I didn't think it was overlong.  I wasn't bored for one minute.  The characters are so engaging that I didn't even feel tempted to look at my watch.  Audiences have a phobia of character development nowadays.  That's why so many movies are cut to an hour and thirty to an hour and forty minutes.  It's the development of the characters that help develop the suspense.  Even though we never know for sure what Ripley's motivations are for killing people, we get a sense of the jealousy, insecurity and loneliness he feels.  Not saying that he's justified for his actions, but Minghella allows us to really enter his mind without the use of narration.The film gets more and more intriguing as it gets along.  This is a REAL edge-of-your-seat thriller.  The ending doesn't contain any plot twists or any genuine surprises, but I wasn't hoping for one.  Minghella pretty much leaves things open-ended.  I know there have been a couple other movies made (I haven't seen them yet) with the character of Tom Ripley, inspired by Patricia Highsmith's novels.  Maybe soon there will be another.My score:  9 (out of 10)",The Talented Mr. Ripley
72,classicalsteve,Mr Ripley the International Man of Mystery During His Coming of Age: Damon and Law Are Unmatched,9,29 September 2012,"When people on the lower rungs of the social ladder see those on the upper rungs, they may wonder what do those people up there have that we don't? Are they really smarter? Do they have so much more talent? Or is it only that those in the upper circles get more opportunities while others have to climb there way up and try to prove themselves while those enjoying the benefits take it for granted? It might seem unfair. However, maybe there's a different way. What if someone pretended like he or she were already among the social elite? What if someone fabricated their education, their talents and their social standing to infiltrate the upper class which often seems barred to those in the lower classes? Would they possibly gain opportunities by simply pretending that they were already a member? Of course they would not only have to create a personal history but also master the etiquette of those on top.This is what the young Tom Ripley sets out to do in his first episode of infiltrating the upper echelons through deceit and eventually crime. Matt Damon, in a tour-de-force performance, is a lowly hotel worker who manages to get into social gatherings of the upper-crust. He plays piano at a high-class event, substituting for someone who didn't want to take the gig. He even borrows a jacket with the Princeton Univesity logo. There he meets an older couple whose son went to Princeton. When the couple inquire if Ripley had met their son, he acts as if they were old friends. We learn that the son is living in Italy and that his father desperately wants him to return. He offers Ripley $1000 plus expenses if he'll go to Italy and bring him back his son. Considering this takes place in the 1950's, $1000 is a king's ransom. This would be almost $9000 in today's money.In a short time, Ripley arrives in an Italian town replete with stone walkways and narrow streets. He finds Dickie Greenleaf, played by Jude Law in an equally stunning performance, living in a perpetual paradise with his girlfriend Marge (Gwentheth Paltro). Because he's independently wealthy, Dickie drinks and plays Jazz, and occasionally cheats on his girlfriend. all the while housed in a beautiful seaside apartment. Ripley befriends the couple, and they become a kind of strange three-some. The three get along almost like a little family, with Ripley and Dickie like brothers, and Marge acting both as the female lover of Dickie but also rather maternal towards both. Another friend of Dickie's enters into the menage a trois, Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who suspects something isn't quite right with Tom Ripley. Dickie and Tom's friendship becomes strained when, at one point, Dickie also begins to question who Ripley really is and his motives.A stunning completely character-driven story. The acting is absolutely first rate. The most impressive is the relationship between Damon and Law which is so believable you feel as if you're spying on real people rather than watching a movie. The actors create a mystical bond which is uncommon in film, reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and like films. But here, there is a perfect blend of drama and suspense which makes Ripley one of the most interesting and original of films.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
73,Stampsfightclub,Story tackles too much but Damon thrives when around,6,22 April 2009,"Tom Ripley (Damon) is sent to Italy to bring Dickie Greenleaf (Law) back to New York but soon finds himself caught up in the rich lifestyle.After his wonderful performance as Will Hunting Matt Damon found himself on the a-list and here he continues that riveting drama acting in a performance that opens in an electric and sharp manner. As Ripley arrives in Italy we see his method acting begin as he learns jazz, and practices his Italian before meeting Greenleaf. Soon the pair becomes close as they find common interests and we viewers are right in the heart of this charming tale about a guy who is now living the rich life with a caring charming friend and his fiancée, so where does it all go wrong? Minghella creates a subtle and almost sombre picture about loneliness and dreams that never quite reaches its full potential because of its mixed concepts. For example this never seems to target the right genre; there is simply too much space. The dramatic turn of events at the beginning place this into drama but halfway through there's a murder and now we're in crime thriller mode. This is then followed by some bizarre love concepts that have fans debating the sexual orientation of Ripley, which makes it further dramatic and the loophole continues with mystery and yet more crime. There is simply too much going on and the film is therefore punished.Perhaps this could have worked. Once Ripley starts playing with the idea of adopting Greenleaf's lifestyle we are right in the heart of a Catch Me if You Can concept that is too flaky for words. There are too many narrow escapes, unfathomable playing people and chance meeting timing in the story's context that would never happen in real life. So then the drama genre has been ruined and you are left with the thriller concept. On the run, enjoying the lifestyles, this gets the blood pumping at times but never generates the slickness that Spielberg's picture delivered with such ease.Damon is better than Di Caprio but at the cost of starring in the wrong picture. A Tom Ripley character could have thrived better in Catch Me but for the most part, Ripley lights a spark in the muddled tale of events in Italy.The location settings are established vivaciously by the director and the culture is well reflected with the inclusion of jazz music and the funeral scenes in the lake.You would imagine the book this is based on might give a clearer indication of the genre and give more time to Greenleaf's character and is perhaps worth a look but this adaptation, whilst occasionally lively with Damon on screen, is too muddled in ideas",The Talented Mr. Ripley
74,CharltonBoy,Slower than Mr Slow from Slowtown,6,24 December 2000,"I will start by saying this film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and that is at least half an hour too long. I'm not saying i didnt like this film because it was interesting and had some good moments in it but not enough for my liking. Matt Damon stars in this yarn about a young piano tuner who is asked to go to italy by a millionaire to retreve his son and bring him back to New York. When he gets out there he becomes fascinated in him and eventually takes over his persona. This film had a lot of potential to be great but failed to deliver. It also doesn't help that Gwyneth""i'm so bloody great"" Paltrow over acts her way through this film. Way , way to boring. 6 out of 10.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
75,gbheron,Interesting Character Study,8,12 October 2002,"Who is Tom Ripley, the personage of the film's title? That's really the central premise of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", and it's a good question. The film is a period piece set amongst the moneyed few of 1950s America. Ripley, as played by Matt Damon, is a human chameleon, adept at impersonating others, down to the matching signatures. His criminal career starts during a wealthy New York party where Tom is playing piano as part of the paid entertainment. He's wearing a borrowed Princeton University blazer, the alma matter of the host's wayward son, and is mistaken for one of the son's friends. Ripley slips quickly and easily into his first deception, that of the son's best friend at college. Subsequently the father hires Tom to go to Italy, where the son is slumming with his girlfriend, and bring him back to New York.Once in Italy, Tom ingratiates himself into the company of the son, Dickie Greenleaf, (Jude Law), girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), and their assortment of young wealthy sybarites. As the impersonations become more complex, the possibilities for exposure escalate, and the measures needed to keep the charade rolling take a deadly turn.Matt Damon goes out on a limb portraying Tom Ripley, as the movie is essentially a character study of this complex person. He pulls it off, and Anthony Minghella, the director, gets excellent acting support from Law, Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Other aspects of the movie also work very well, not the least the on-site Italian locations, and the 1950s sets. This is not a mystery, nor a romance; it's something different and difficult to categorize, and is highly recommended.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
76,TOMASBBloodhound,Lots to rave about here.,10,10 September 2007,"This is a really terrific thriller. There is a lot going on, and you need to bring your attention span, but the reward will be great if you do. Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley. Ripley is an intentionally ambiguous character who uses his many ""talents"" to dig himself into deeper and deeper trouble as he attempts to infiltrate high society. Damon really began to distance himself from boyhood chum Ben Affleck with this role originally intended for Tom Cruise.It all starts out on a rooftop in New York City. Ripley is playing the piano for some type of a cocktail party and he happens to be wearing a borrowed Princeton jacket. A wealthy gentlemen at the party notices this, and quickly recruits Ripley to track his spoiled brat son down over in Italy. His son also attended Princeton, and Ripley claims to have known him there. Ripley accepts this offer since it pays pretty well, allows him to travel, and gives him the chance to get a foot in the door with the upper class. Ripley locates the spoiled son named Dickie who is living with his girlfriend. Jude Law (American accent and all) plays Dicke, and Gwyneth Paltrow is the girlfriend. Ripley quickly befriends the couple and admits why he's there. Rather than try to convince Dickie to return to America with him, he simply joins him in run of debauchery. The good vibes between these characters don't last long, however. Ripley develops a mad obsession about Dickie that can really only lead to the kind of violent confrontation we see later on a tiny motorboat. Ripley then becomes Dickie. He has learned how to forge his signature, his mannerisms, and he is quickly developing a taste for the finer things in life.Or course there are complications when one assumes another person's identity. Ripley keeps running into people Dickie knew well, and he has to come up with some amazing lies and schemes to keep them believing the real Dickie is still alive. If someone gets too close, Ripley has to either run away or dispose of whomever might find out his secrets. As a viewer, you might often find yourself trying to come up with a good story or lie before Ripley can to see if you're as cunning as he apparently is. The story works itself out intelligently, and by doubling back on some of the tiniest details from earlier scenes, but somehow it all works brilliantly. What kind of man is Tom Ripley? Really, he is whatever he needs to be in order to keep going. Is he intelligent? Hell yes. Is he dangerous? Hell yes. Is he gay? If he needs to be. He has a chance to bed Cate Blanchette, but seems unable to complete the deal. Or maybe he just doesn't have time. It's difficult to say.The cast is a wonderful ensemble of some of the finest actors working today. Phillip Seymour Hoffman really stands out in a sleazy supporting role. Law is superb. Blanchette is not in enough scenes. Paltrow is good, but Damon puts them all to shame. Anthony Minghella's direction hits all the right notes. Italy looks as beautiful as you could ask it to. It's really hard to find a flaw in this one. 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
77,stamper,What the hell...,5,8 May 2000,"I saw this one, basically, because I like Matt Damon a lot, and I really thought, the commercial was good. I was expecting someJekyll & Hyde alike thriller, well guess again (Bare in mind that I don't like Paltrow that much except in Seven) This was a slow dragging, what was this anyhow, yes this was a story of a boy, who had no real life and no real friends that finds a life and good friends, then it all ends. His friendship, the good life. That's about after an hour or so I guess. Then you think: Hey, IT'S ON!!!! Well, guess again The movie goes further with dull, everyday, non  suspense stuff, a crying Paltrow, bla, bla (nothing of true value here) Then comes the ending which begins with (again) a totally surprisingly appearance of someone (very surprising indeeed). Well not really if you keep your head working (it had to happen), cause the movie can't go without it, yet you are surprised at how it is done (yeah right!!!!). Inevitably in a way, but should have been skipped. The ending itself is good, finally, some real felling, some excitement, and then it's over. Overall: medicore, slow, film, with I think Medicore performanced (except Damon (good)). Ending (although short) made up a little for this overlong flick.After all (a bit too kind of me!), due to the ending which lasted like 6 good minutes

78,petra_ste,The Underrated Mr. Ripley,8,29 October 2018,"There are thrillers I enjoy but rarely feel any desire to watch again; however, I find that those lighter on set-pieces but heavier on character interactions and atmosphere have a better replay value for me.The Talented Mr. Ripley is a perfect example. The movie takes its time in the first act, allowing us to identify with ambitious liar Tom Ripley (Matt Damon in one of his best performances) who yearns for a better life and manages to ingratiate himself with wealthy heir Dickie Greenleaf (an electric Jude Law).Dickie is enjoying an endless vacation in Italy; Tom starts to tag along. At first the narcissistic Dickie likes the company of this nice young man who obviously idolizes him; however, Tom develops an obsession with Dickie, who decides he is fed up with him...The movie lets us share Ripley's point of view, entangles us in his web of lies. The bond we develop with him is crucial or the rest of the film, where his deceptions take a darker turn, simply wouldn't work.Damon and Law are great, well supported by Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jack Davenport. Minghella's direction is elegant, meticulous, crafting moments of great tension.One of my favorite scenes is the first killing. I don't know whether it comes straight from the novel or was changed for the adaptation, but it's masterful, making use of a clever writing trick: setting a scene where you'd least expect it to take place. We are used to movie murders happening in dark, ominous locations, but this one unfolds in broad daylight on a boat rocking in the middle of a beautiful blue sea: when violence erupts, it's all the more shocking.As a police investigation starts, Tom relies on his talent for lying and impersonating people, but there is a stark difference from the usual trope of the innocent man dragged into a crime against his will and who is just trying to survive. Tom clearly relishes the wealth and opportunities brought by his deception: he likes this game and is very good at it.The bookend to the first murder is the ending (MAJOR SPOILERS), with the last killing in a ship's cabin. Once again Tom kills someone he loves, only this time, with cruel irony, the victim actually loves him back and the killing isn't a spur-of-the-moment reaction but deliberate, as Tom finds no other way to cover up his crimes. The Pyrrhic victory of the villanous protagonist, who has managed to fool everyone but is now broken and alone, is one of the most memorable movie endings of recent cinema.8,5/10",The Talented Mr. Ripley
79,eminkl,It's one of those films where you'll feel wrong about your rooting interest,8,18 April 2020,"A small-scale imposter / con man, making the rounds in 1950s New York, gets caught up in something much greater than his usual scam and decides to let it ride, if just to see where he winds up. In this case the answer is Italy, gorgeous vestige of the old world with just a few hints of the modern one, where he's tasked with convincing a flippant trust funder to return from a perpetual, fortune-draining holiday. That mission quickly goes by the wayside, just as soon as he realizes how much easier life is in the lap of luxury, and he merely exacerbates said money-letting as the wealthy playboy's new wingman. When things take a turn for the messy, though, his welcome worn thin and nothing to show for it but bittersweet memories, a panicked string of responses sends the entire comfortable lifestyle into a tailspin. At its root, Ripley is an example of how fear and rejection can press a normally smart, affable person over the brink into monstrosity, a surprise considering the playful tone of the first act. Matt Damon, still fresh from his breakout in 1997's Good Will Hunting, shows great versatility in the leading role (essential for such a complicated character), smoothly masking that twitch in his eye from all but the viewing audience. It's one of those films where you'll feel wrong about your rooting interest, knowing all along that the guy absolutely does not deserve a happy ending, with the final moments serving as your comeuppance.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Providing one doesn't looktoo closely at script details, the production provides anengaging evening out. It is particularly effective viewing this on the large screen for which it was intended.Of the many young actors who have played leading rolesduring the past two decades, two of the most notable areDenzel Washington and Matt Damon.  Both have a naturalness that works imperceptibly, and can carry an entire production on their shoulders.  One tends to go with them, believe them, respect them, even though their character's actions may not be to one's liking. This has been described as having ""It,"" though no one hasbeen able to define what ""It"" really is.  In the case ofthis film, Damon constantly draws attention to his area of the screen, carrying the viewer along with a strange kind of sympathy.

81,rzajac,Possibly one of the greatest movies of all time,10,8 July 2002,"***SPOILERS***Quite simply one of the finest movies ever made.I want to open up by applauding the incredible acting. I had Paltrow pegged as one of ""them""; you know, the latest hot babe. And this was after having seen her in ""Shakespeare"". Well, I have the highest respect I have ever felt toward an actress after seeing this movie. Another commenter in these pages said Blanchett was underutilized. Ms. Blanchett did exactly the right things at exactly the right times. What she (may have) lacked in line-count, she made up in depth; deeply portraying her whimpy, depthless character; a very tall order indeed, and done with aplomb! And my only remonstrance with Mr. Damon here is that he somehow subsequently got mixed up with the motley crew that made the execrable ""Bourne Identity, The"". He really doesn't have to take these lousy jobs!Everything about this movie is tops: The settings/sets, the light, editing, direction, story, screen writing, acting (again), sound, music, .... what else?A specific comment with respect to the screen writing--or rather, where the screen writing and acting collide and sizzle: I could not get over the gorgeousness of the scene where Tom returns to Marge without Dickie. We saw simple, effective dialog that illuminates the beauty of direct, life-loving probity.This is one of those movies that makes me glad to be a semi-literate. Having not read the book, the twist in the middle of the movie is a complete and total stunner. I want movies to do this to me, and this one did.Lastly, comes the hard part; the driving and incriminating moral of the movie. This is another of those movies, like Memento, that invites you, if you are so inclined, to look at yr own self. Of course, this is not to say the movie succeeds at making murderers of us all. But I think it treads that fine line which allows us to abstract off the features of Ripley's behavior that are distinctly and universally human in their evil, and therefore a part of each of us. And this might help us to change, or seek change. What more can you hope for from a movie than help toward spiritual transformation?I will say, if you don't like dark movies, don't watch this movie. If you don't like white-knucklers, stay home. My wife walked out of ""The Player"" after the murder scene because it was too uptight. ""Ripley"" was almost too uptight for me!One last item: This movie's many-hued portrayal of jazz-in-Europe was a lovely confirmation of what we all already know: That jazz is perhaps one of the U.S.'s greatest contributions to world culture. This touching undercurrent theme contrasted poignantly with the overcurrent theme of moral insensibility and menace.Geez, does this movie have an even grander metaphor lurking in its depths regarding some grand issue such as American foreign policy (as did ""Pulp Fiction"")? I'll sleep on that one.Go see this movie!>>> Addendum 8/2012I thought of writing a review, only to find that I already had written one. But then, I saw that parting bit about the story as a metaphor for a grand social issue, and realized that an addendum would do the trick.It's a story about a man's lack of love, likely a fundamental lack of basic moral feeling, and his discovery that perhaps only by dint of these personality flaws he might succeed at breaking the rules of class.It could say something very interesting about the greatest tragedy of life: It's common for religion to tell us that life is less-than-ideal and often tragic because we fail to exercise morality. This flick seems to imply that the opposite is true; that the standards of class structure which sustain this strife-producing social imbalance very much rest on pillars of what most people consider a bedrock moral standard: We have what we have because we deserve what we have; and the corollary: If you don't have it, you don't deserve it, so shut up already. The big question, and the one pushed by Ripley, regards the extent to which the careful maintenance of class privilege defines morality, NOT the other way 'round.When you look at it in this light, it seems to unlock the riddles of much violent immorality in the world. As an American, I would naturally be inclined to see blithe, never-ending warmaking as a perfect example.The image we're left with--which allows one to reasonably extrapolate future violence and eventual capture and conviction--makes me wonder how long it will be until society finally catches up with the biggest scam of all; class privilege, and the church, state, media, and ""common knowledge"" institutions that pose and lie on its behalf.It would be disingenuous not to touch upon the images of upper-classhood shown, and it certainly is a mixed bag. Marge seems almost tailor made to teach us that deference to our ""betters"" could be the wise course. But the oily Freddie and the blind, pampered Meredith quickly lead us out of that particular temptation. And Dickie walks the line. He's an apparently gracious expression of honorably-directed privilege, but one which swiftly disperses under the glare of the light of simple probity. If we could choose to be one of these high-lifers, we would probably choose to be Marge. She lends a welcome touch of balance to an otherwise powerfully negative presentation of class privilege. Let's give thanks for Marge, then get on our knees and pray for the whole obscene mess to be finally exposed for the slo-mo moral train wreck that it is.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
82,spookyrat1,The Evolution of a Sociopath!,8,11 May 2019,"With The Talented Mr Ripley, Anthony Minghella gives us a superb adaption of Patricia Highsmith's novel of the same name. It tells the story of a young con artist, who almost accidentally appears to evolve into the role of a serial killer whilst in pursuit of a hedonistic lifestyle, who, with a combination of intelligence, cunning and a unique skill set, always seems able to evade justice.Minghella is extremely clever in the manner in which he constructs his narrative. The first hour of the film almost plays out like some boys own gap year romantic adventure set on the sun-dappled shores of the late 1950's Italian coastline. Matt Damon is the ideal young protagonist, with Minghella highlighting what is almost (but not quite) the innocent boyishness of his title character, as he takes his first uncertain, but enthusiastic steps, in pursuit of La Dolce Vitta.The movie is a triumph of casting. Besides Damon, Jude Law features in a star-making turn as Dickie Greenleaf, a character he succeeds in both making alluring and somewhat repellent, thus ultimately becoming the ideal lamb to be led to perhaps what is an unplanned slaughter. Gwyneth Paltrow has both the looks and talent to give us a multi-dimensional Marge, who we see convincingly becoming more confused and confounded by her ""Dickie's"" apparent behaviour, as the story continues to unfold. Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a smaller, but crucial supporting role, is perfect as the very much self-absorbed Freddie Miles, an old compatriot of Dickie's and a rival for Ripley, of Dickie's attention.The thriller elements of the story are ratcheted up in the movie's second half as Ripley's darker motivations become more predominant and his actions become more challenged by the intercessions of characters such as the aforementioned Freddie, attractive socialite Meredith (Cate Blanchette), Marge's lawyer friend Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport), the Italian police and an American private detective. The twists and turns resulting from Ripley's increasingly devious actions are both enormously suspenseful, but pleasingly realistic, given the skills we see him develop as well as the connections we see him establish.Anthony Minghella's adaption of Highsmith's book is, in my opinion, an example of an extremely sophisticated, cinematic enhancement of the original literary work. Tom Ripley is introduced as a fascinating anti-hero. It just seems somewhat odd in this era of franchise brands, that unlike a similar character such as Hannibal Lector, no other well-known directors have gone on to successfully continue his complex, yet beguiling story.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
83,cchase,The best movie Hitchcock never made....,9,6 February 2000,"As I am neither well-paid for writing reviews or a well-known name, I can only hope that you will trust the experience I've gained from the tens of thousands of movie hours I have notched on my belt, when I say that Anthony Minghella's THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY may be the finest film that Alfred Hitchcock never made. Or at least he would have, if he could be here today.Like the richest, creamiest zuppa you ever slurped from a spoon, Minghella and company paint the most dazzling, alluring and sensuous pictures of Italy I've ever seen on film; an idyllic ideal that makes it perfectly understandable why the character of Tom Ripley is motivated to do what he does later on.But as you scoop up the sumptuous feast of divine visuals from Minghella's brimming bowl, you begin to sense the aftertaste...the sourness of the pasta, just the faintest whiff of rot and corruption from the steaming vegetables...the way that the money and prestige that make this life affordable for the people that Ripley falls in with, taints everything with a bitter, jaded sense of ennui, soul-deadening hedonism and the opportunity to act upon the most sociopathic urges without fear of repercussion.In other words, Tom has become a garden snake entwined in a nest of rich vipers. Unbeknownst to them, however, his poison is just a touch deadlier than theirs.As portrayed so superbly by Matt Damon in a turn he gave way before the Damon/Affleck Express started rolling in Hollywood, he shows us the neediness, the desperation, the cunning and the calculation of Ripley captured by Patricia Highsmith in her 1950's novel, by allowing us access to what went on inside Tom's head.Damon uses both the source material and Minghella's excellent screenplay to turn that inward life outward, and to show us why we're so fascinated and repelled by him all at once: there's a little bit of Tom in all of us.Tom is mistaken for a former Ivy league classmate of Dickie Greenleaf, the son of a shipping magnate. Mr. Greenleaf (James Rebhorn), presses Tom into traveling to the town of Mongiobello, all expenses paid, to try to talk sense into Dickie and persuade him to return to his duties as the heir apparent of the Greenleaf empire.Down at the heels and reduced to scrambling to eke out a meager existence of which Greenleaf is unaware, the offer is irresistible to Tom. And the moment he arrives at ""Mongi"", you can already tell that he's thinking about how to work this angle to the maximum advantage: never having to return to the States while living on Mr. Greenleaf's dime.The last thought of leaving is completed obliterated when Tom finally lays eyes on Dickie, a tanned, toned and tasty bit of rich, spoiled brat, in a beautiful star-making turn by Jude Law, (a Golden Globe nominee for Best Supporting Actor.) Tom falls immediately head over heels for the man and the life that he leads, and the stage is set for the dark doings to come underneath the sun-dappled surface.As the Hitchcockian heroine of the piece, Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning as Marge Sherwood, Dickie's companion and sometime lover. Because her character possesses a kind of trusting naivete unusual for such a bunch of rich swells, the fire-and-ice allure of Hitch's former blond goddesses such as Kim Novak, Grace Kelly and Tippi Hedren is missing here.Not to say that Marge is incapable of expressing her sexuality, but the worldliness that counterbalanced the aloofness of the ice princesses before her would've allowed her to see through Ripley's machinations right away.One who does recognize it is Dickie's carousing chum Freddie Miles, (the ever-versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman). The very picture of priggish, callous, class-conscious snobbery and disdain, not only does he take offense at the convenience of Tom's situation, but at the very IDEA that someone so ""bourgeois"" could hob-nob with the likes of them.Having only read about a third of the source novel, I understand now why I found it filed under 'crime.' It doesn't take a genius to figure out as Ripley is drawn deeper into the lives of Dickie, Marge and their company, how important and vital it becomes to Tom to hold onto this wonderful new set of circumstances at any cost. With the talents of impersonation, invention, forgery and manipulation already well engrained in his amoral repertoire, why would murder seem such a fantastic stretch?Also worth mentioning are excellent performances by Cate Blanchett as Meredith, someone who becomes an unwitting partner-in-crime for Tom, and Jack Davenport as Peter, one of Marge's friends, and someone who holds as much attraction for Tom as Dickie does, and having become a part of his life, also becomes an unfortunate victim of Ripley's need to keep the secrets of that life intact.Combining undercurrents of death, desire, unrequited male love and lust and desperation with the picture-postcard landscape, you find THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY a worthy companion to the book if not every bit its equal, and more than worth your time.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

He is propelled by the excellent screen-writing, as we are given one of the most fascinating character studies ever put to screen. Tom Ripley is someone we should hate, his whole existence has been bought on deception, but we are also encouraged to sympathise with him, love him. Should Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law, also very good) live the high life just because of his birth right? The drama is set in gorgeous Italy, with beautiful cinematography and production design. The only flaws are two of the supporting characters. I know why Blanchett and Hoffman's characters are there (they are plot points, to keep the pressure on Ripley's disguise), but they, Blanchett in particular, are annoying. It might just be Blanchett's boring mannered acting (Gwyneth Paltrow is ten times more interesting than her), but her character adds nothing to the film.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
85,TheNorthernMonkee,"dark, deep, clever, at times miserable, superb",7,18 July 2005,"SPOILERS There are people out there with money and power who take it for granted. There are also those out there who have neither and hate those who don't appreciate it. We all know the type of character. The domineering 'jock' who dominates the school sporting arena, the arrogant rich kid who exploit others for a laugh. These people are all around us and we tolerate them not through desire but through lack of alternative. In Anthony Minghella's ""The Talented Mr Ripley"", we are presented to an individual who loves these people yet simultaneously ends up hurting them. Brilliantly played by Matt Damon, the character of Tom Ripley is a dark and twisted character who finds himself forever trying to cover his own tracks. His past follows him everywhere and we learn to both fear and pity this man, this clever man, this awkward genius. His story, written by Patricia Highsmith and adapted into this film by Minghella is a powerful piece of drama with moments of depth, mystery and ingenuity. It is a magnificent story and leaves you wanting more.Tom Ripley (Damon) has three skills. He can forge signatures, he can impersonate people and he can lie a lot. Using these skills, Ripley encounters millionaire Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) who has a 'missing' son. Sent to Europe for the first time, Ripley finds himself being paid to convince Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) to return to America. Spending time with young Greenleaf Junior, Ripley finds the man increasingly intriguing and begins to fall in love with him. An incident at sea changes all this however.Dark and eerie, the character of Tom Ripley is pure genius. Magnificantly crafted by Patricia Highsmith's original work, the character is brought to screen through a combination of exquisite acting by Damon and the skills behind the camera of Minghella. Ripley is portrayed as an innocent. Embracing those who treat him badly, he always gives the impression that he wants to be one of them, but simultaneously embraces the notion that they don't appreciate what they possess. He is the guy who is forever stepped on, however for once this type of character is fighting back.In the film, these spoilt characters are also played to perfection. Whilst the more kind ones are played with beauty (for example Jack Davenport's Peter), this collection of rich kids are portrayed with striking disgust. Whether it's the obnoxious Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman) or the deeper but ultimately just as putrid Dickie (Law), all are played with skill and ability and it is little surprise that Jude Law got an Oscar nomination for his performance.The finest thing about this film, aside from the acting, is the way that it manages to combine so many different moods throughout. It is rare for a film to be so dark yet so depressive (often dark films can be almost emotionless by the end because it is overdone), however Minghella's film is a success. Ranging throughout from cheerful, funny, bright, tragic, and deep, it manages to display many emotions before settling for it's preferred misery. With an ending which tugs at the heart strings, you find yourself amazed at how such an originally upbeat film can change so drastically. It is an amazing combination of screenplay, original story, direction and acting.""The Talented Mr Ripley"" is not an easy film to watch. Varying in emotion throughout, it is a brilliant piece of direction, scripting and acting. With characters meticulously brought to life through adaptation and action, it is a powerful piece of work which flexes all the emotional chords from start to finish. It is an immensely clever film, and it is worthy of anyones viewing time.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Set against the backdrop of tourist Italy - encompassing Rome and Venice and all points in between - Anthony Minghella's film is a compelling treat from start to finish, layering detail upon detail as Damon's friendship with Law blossoms and sours, leading to an inevitable plot twist which introduces a whole new set of complications for the central characters, rendering the audience complicit in Ripley's escalating crime wave.Damon may seem a little too young and unworldly for such a complex character, but he judges the role with great sensitivity, especially in those scenes where (overtly or otherwise) he indicates a sexual attraction to Law which goes unreciprocated (or does it?), until the characters are driven apart by jealousy, bitterness and - ultimately - violence. His fantasies shattered by harsh reality, Damon finds solace in the arms of a mutual acquaintance (Jack Davenport), the only person capable of taking Law's place in Damon's affections, only for their chance of happiness to be snatched away by a cruel trick of fate.

Matt Damon that's done cool agent stuff in Jason Bourne movies, being math genius in Good Will Hunting, angel in Dogma etc. does truly one of his finest performances here, and; the same with Law and Paltrow - and the great bit of the supporting character friend played by Philip Seymour Hoffman.The fine portraits of Italian beauty in jazz and food, makes the movie a whole lot more charming than it's true message and story. Smart set, smart made - a good movie! STARS: 4/5",The Talented Mr. Ripley
89,perfectbond,'I'd rather be a fake somebody than a real nobody.',10,30 December 2003,"Matt Damon is absolutely convincing in the title role, and along with Jude Law's Dickie Greenleaf, provides the viewer with an incredibly fascinating character study. The conflicting emotions of Tom Ripley are played wonderfully by Damon who conveys subtlety with great depth. I was in awe of his performance and am flabbergasted he didn't receive an Oscar nomination for this role. Law, Paltorw, Blanchett and Hoffman do a terrific job playing of Damon's Ripley. Director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient, Cold Mountain) also did a masterful job of capturing the period and and his location photography was spectacular. I should also add that the soundtrack to this film was wholly appropriate and added much to the final product. I can't recommend this film strongly enough, 10/10.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
90,raymond-15,Not quite believable.,7,18 September 2000,"I am not an expert on the art of impersonation, but I would think that one would require more than a new suit and a different hairdo to get away with it.  Adopting a new name and forging that person's signature might not be so difficult, but sooner or later the villian will surely be exposed. In this film the young Mr. Ripley manipulates events to his own advantage.  He has quite an adventurous life disporting himself as two different persons and those who become the least bit suspicious he promptly kills off.  If you choose to ignore the improbable situations, you'll find it entertaining and even exciting when the police start to make enquiries about the disappearance of his friend Dickie.  Set in various parts of beautiful Italy, the cinemaphotographer can hardly go wrong with his camera,as the story takes us to Rome, Venice and other well-known spots.  Jude Law who plays the irresponsible Dickie is most impressive as the flamboyant son out for a good time with his jazz enthusiasts.  Here is a young actor worth watching. Points earned by this film are mainly for entertainment value.  In short, a good yarn.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
91,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,9,1 May 2015,"Based on the 1955 novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith, the first in the Ripley series or ""Ripliad"". Damon plays the titular character, who is a master imposter that takes full advantage of the random opportunities that cross his path, and makes full use of people's willingness to assume they're always being told the truth. After playing a gig as a substitute pianist at a cocktail party in New York City, Ripley accepts a generous offer from Herbert Greenleaf (Rebhorn) to go to Italy to track down his son Dickie (Law), who is having the time of his life against his father's approval. When things falls into place for Ripley to scheme his way to the easy life, he finds himself fitting right in with Dickie; but when things start to fall apart, blood is shed. For the viewer seeking a conventional plot structure, the movie does have its slow moments; but others will appreciate the psychological unfolding of the story, with the viewer rooting that the villain gets away with it, while also getting swept up in Law's toxic charm just like the regretful characters. Beautiful settings as well.***½ (out of four)",The Talented Mr. Ripley
92,Christian_Dimartino,Matt Damon blew my mind!,10,24 November 2010,"Sometimes when an actor gets under my skin in a movie, I will probably give them the most credit. Like Sandra Bullock in Crash. I think he did the best job. Tom Cruise in Magnolia, did the best job. Christoph Waltz in Inglourious basterds. Gave the best performance. Matt Damon is another example of that.Matt Damon's performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley really,really got under my skin. He was creepy, and annoying,and frightening. But he was terrific at it. To be honest it's his performance that makes the movie. Though it's a really good movie.Damon plays Tom Ripley, a guy who performs at weddings or something. When a stranger(James Rebhorn) hires Ripley to travel to Italy to find his playboy son Dickie(Jude Law), he doesn't know what hes getting himself into.Ripley stirs up trouble even before he meets Dickie. He steals his identity once he meets a woman(Cate Blanchett). Once he gets to Italy, he meets Dickie, gets to know him and his fiancé(Gweneth Paltrow), then kills him,and steals his identity.The film is really weird. You don't know whether Ripley's gay or straight, or what schemes he has next. Which is a great thing. Matt Damon really got under my skin. I hated him. The more I think about him as Ripley, the more I hate him as a person. I'm sorry. But the more I think about this movie, the more I like it. This is a brainy thriller that really works.Damon really steals the show, but it's not only him that does a great job. Jude Law and Gweneth Paltrow are terrific also. The film has a lot of twists and turns, which I like also. This is a thriller that not only thrills but scares too. And it wouldn't scare if it wasn't for the help of Matt Damon. Though I hated him here, I think he's a great actor. This is an unforgettable and unmissable film.A-",The Talented Mr. Ripley

94,Movie-12,A sure contender for Best picture of the year. **** out of ****.,10,15 February 2000,"THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY / (1999) ****Starring: Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Cate Blanchett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jack Davenport, James Rebhorn, and Philip Baker Hall Written and directed by Anthony Minghella. Running time:139 minutes. Rated R (for modest violence, some language, and brief nudity).
By Blake French:""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a near flawless character study of some of the most vivid, brilliantly written characters of the year. It represents the best of quality filmmaking through development of its essential material with strong bases and firm knowledge. This is one of the top five movies of 1999, and will undoubtedly be placed on the Academy Award's ballet for best picture.Matt Damon stars as the talented Mr. Tom Ripley, an overlooked nobody who meets Herbert Greenleaf while playing the piano at a party in Manhattan. Wearing a Princeton overcoat, Herbert automatically assumes Tom knew his son, Dickie, at Princeton. Their son has moved to Europe and refuses to return home, and this worries the Greenleaf family. Herbert makes Tom an offer: if he'll travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return home, the Greenleafs will pick up the tab and throw in an additional one thousand dollars. How can Ripley refuse?At a beach in Italy--where Dickie and his fiancee, Marge Sherwood, lay sunbathing. Tom introduces himself to the duo, and is excepted as a long lost friend. Back at Dickie's mansion, Tom explains why he is in Italy, thus becomes an even closer friend, trusted with many of Dickie's possessions and intents. Several other key events lead to the permanent impersonation of Dickie by Tom Ripley. Such happens as Dickie being blamed for drowning a local woman, the introduction of Dickie's Epicurean friend, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a rich young woman moving through Europe at the same time as Tom named Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett), a murder sequence that takes place on a small boat, and an investigation of a character's death lead by detective Alvin MacCarron (Philip Baker Hall).The development of characters in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is outstanding. Director Anthony Minghella pays close attention to each individual character, creating depth, personality, and interest in even the minor roles. The writing is very careful not to become overzealous or overly aggressive in nature. It represents theme and overtones in the forms of homosexuality, insanity and injustice, provoking audience's participation through thoughts and involvement. The murderous events further develop the mere sickness of the slick Tom Ripley's deep inner confusion.
The characters are all ingeniously cast. Matt Damon plays the complex Mr. Ripley with much inner depth. He gives the character the internal insanity and deep secrets with a stylistic blandness. There is little tension in most of his non crucial scenes, providing Tom with dimension. Jude Law creates Dickie with specific descriptions and motivation that we are able to understand. I also enjoyed the performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman in a bitter and straight forward role. He acts with a realistic, arrogant attitude towards Tom, and also provides the film with one of several important moments.The average structure of movies is rarely as engaging as the preciseness in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" Although the story begins rather quickly, throughout the film's 139 minute running time, this does not lead into trouble. To greatly generalize the plot, it begins with two central characters, Tom and Dickie. The film then takes an enormously surprising turn at mid point, and drifts apart into several focused directions. As the bodies pile up, and more important events occur, a collusion follows these points to the rare technique of using the antagonist as the protagonist. I was rooting for the side characters here, pointing to character traits similar to one's found in ""The Jackal."" This is a rare, original method of characterization, and it works very well here.""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a very intriguing motion picture. Each scene moves the story forward, nothing unessential is present within the film. It is a journey into the mind of Tom Ripley, a man so full of dangerous secrets and hidden torment that his mind is a dark basement of mysteries just dying to be unlocked. When the basement door is finally opened, it is remarkable what we are able to discover.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures and Miramax Films.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
95,alice liddell,A giddy masterpiece - as much a tribute to Hitchcock as Highsmith.(possible spoiler),9,1 March 2000,"How can the critics get it so wrong, so often?  As playful as AMERICAN BEAUTY is earnest, as gleefully narcissistic (all those mirrors and surfaces reflecting nothing but itself) as BEAUTY is gravely self-regarding, THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY is one of the most purely enjoyable films to come out of Hollywood in years, an audience-baiting jeu d'esprit such as Hitchcock might have made if he's been allowed (oh, he did: PSYCHO).  RIPLEY is the inverse of BEAUTY - profoundly shallow, unconcerned with truth, realism, character, grand statements - time will reveal it to be far the richer film, while BEAUTY, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, is exposed as the KRAMER VS KRAMER of the late 90s.There has been an awful lot of disinformation spread about this film: for instance, that it collapses after Jude Law's dispatch.  Surely this is where the fun begins.  The first hour is brilliant, breezy, but traditional entertainment: the playful homoeroticism, the power games, the unrepentingly scatalogical puns (loved the ring!); the most beautiful man in the world, Jude Law - teasing us with the many manifestations of his deliciousness - in raffish trunks; jaw-dropping bath chess; playing the Casanova with the local Italians while fooling around with Tom; the arrogant, privileged thoughtlessness that is almost Proustian in its lively appeal; the outrageously fetishistic hats over his lovely suits - I'm not sure whether I prefer white or blue; his splendid derriere when, on the boat, he goes to cheer up Marge - the concomitant degrading of heterosexuality (the distasteful wriggle Tom peeps on in the boat); the way Tom's subjectivity floods the film (from the touristy arrival in Rome, and the bronzed adoration of Dickie's body to the grinding horror of Dickie and Freddie in the music box) undermined by Minghella's subtle ironising (the revolting slabs of meat as Tom begins his journey in New York) that will  continue more sadistically in the second half.The film is also at its most emotional here, Tom building up a great store of audience identification, culminating in his beautiful pieta with Dickie after he's killed him.The second half is where the real fun starts.  Where the theatrical metaphors come into their own - Tom thinks he's the playwright/director (eg when he contrives Meredith and Marge to meet, looking on from his balcony 'box', reversing an early scene as usher when he's caught looking(another recurrent motif)), creating the action, when he's actually a reactor, really quite bumbling, forced to fluke his way out of whatever rotten coincidence Fate (or Minghella) throws at him.The plot becomes sadistically Hitchcockian in two ways: on Tom himself, never allowing him relief; but also on the audience.  This half is littered with moving climaxes that seem to usher in resolution and closure, only for some fresh inconvenience to intervene.  This can be a real test on an audience's sympathies, but, as in Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN (also from a Highsmith novel) for example, these sympathies are based on a desire for a murderer not to get caught, to kill again if the has to, strongly aided by Matt Damon's brilliant (that's a first for me!) aim-to-please, non-sinister performance.The film has also been called misogynistic, but this strikes me  as a convenient label for liberal heterosexuals secretly terrified of a film featuring  and allowing to go unpunished a nihilistic, self-destructive, gay murderer, whose subversion is as much sexual as it is existential or social. RIPLEY is only misogynistic if you unthinkingly identify with Tom, which Minghella, while hoping we do, never does.  The scene with Marge and the razor blade is nasty, but so is he  - he's killed her lover and will do anything to cover it up.  I think it's the fact that Tom is made to seem unpleasant, and not how the unpleasantness affects Marge, that disturbs these critics.  Meredith, for instance, is a very sympathetic character, an unusual mirror image to Tom in many ways.The idea that the film is somehow 'Fellinian' (thanks Germaine) barely deserves comment, unless Rome and loud music constitute the extent of Il Maestro's oeuvre.  Minghella's icy control is alien to Fellini's warm, pessimistic spontaneity - Minghella's method is more literary, as befits a former playwright; the film is a puppet show in a Nabokovian vein rather than a seriously carnivalesque moratorium for modern man (although Federico might have appreciated the juxtaposition of the Virgin's statue and the pregnant suicide emerging from the river.This extends to Minghella's play with 'identity'.  The plot itself calls for a simple transfer of identity, but Minghella is more interested in the tension between a fluid identity that can take on multiple personalities at will, and a concrete Tom Ripley who actually kills people in a real, not abstract, manner.  One cancels the other out, and Tom becomes the undead, who casts no reflection, preying on others like a vampire to keep alive.
His emerging at the beginning and returning at the end to the black splinter on the screen is like Dracula emerging from and returning to, his coffin. Dickie's death leads to that gorgeous boat sequence, when the screen becomes like a fairy tale, shimmering light blurring the sea, tinkly music, like we're entering an enchanted realm.  There is a lot less sun glare in this second half, and the lovelorn piano player also recalls The Phantom Of The Opera.(even music, set up as the only authentic mode of self-expression, is mocked, with Dickie's fickleness and the scene with Peter conducting the mass choir)RIPLEY's circularity (both formally, in terms of the same image beginning and ending the film, and the plot repetition) suggests another literary influence - Henry James.  Tom is the archetypal American abroad in Europe, (literally) a self-made man.  Materially speaking he is an anti-Jamesian figure, he acquires great wealth; Dickie is the inheriting 'European' figure who is threatened (an inverse link to STRANGERS).  But Tom too is eventually corrupted by European privilege, and his comeuppance is a SCARLET STREET-like hell on earth of remorse.Does this amount to homophobia - another homosexual figure whose deviance leads to his permanent unhappiness, whose deviance is murderous and sterile? No more so than any great 'heterosexual' loner - it would do Minghella a disservice to be so reductive.Highsmith's novel has already produced one masterpiece - PLEIN SOLEIL - the differences between the two are instructive.  In the French film, Tom is Alain Delon, then the most beautiful man in the world, far prettier than his nemesis - his transgression is more narcissistic, less an abandoning of personality.  There is no equivalent of the great humiliation scene here, where Delon is cast off on a boat, suffering a Christ-like martyrdom.  That film also features the most erotic scene in all cinema - Delon in Dickie's clothes, loving himself in the mirror, a scene rife with erotic danger. The corresponding scene here is played for laughs as Damon does a Sally Bowles-like drag turn.  This points to the difference between the two films - one is an exceptional, modernist thriller and investigation into image; the remake is a disavowal of all such investigation.  It's great to have them both (and I haven't even mentioned the extraordinary Phillip Seymour Hoffman).",The Talented Mr. Ripley
96,FlickJunkie-2,Less than the sum of the parts,6,29 June 2000,"If you add up all the various aspects of this film, it should have been terrific.  It had a hot and talented young cast, all of whom gave good to great performances.  It had wonderful locations, costumes, props and music. It had an intriguing plot.  And yet by the end all I felt was ennui.This was a case of a director who couldn't induce the full potential out of his various resources.  Anthony Minghella does a fine job on the cinematography and choice of beautiful locations in Italy, but his crafting of the story left it predictable and flaccid.  This was supposed to be both a character study and a thriller.  It was inadequate on both counts.In a well made character study the viewer will come to understand the motivations of the characters.  This film never delivers in this regard. The only character that was well developed was Dickie (Jude Law).  Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a mystery, just a hanger on.  Meredith (Cate Blanchett) was nothing more than a plot device.  But the biggest reason it came up short was because the motivation of Ripley (Matt Damon) was left too ambiguous.  Was Ripley a cunning con man orchestrating a grand caper, an inept interloper who bungled his way through a propitious opportunity, a victim of circumstances, an unrequited gay lover who committed a crime of passion and then needed to cover his trail?  Take your pick.  Minghella doesn't tell the story in a way that makes this clear.As a thriller, it lacked surprise.  Every murder was telegraphed.  The private investigator gives Ripley a pass at the end, obviating the need for Ripley to provide some clever explanation for all the inconsistencies. There was not a single twist in the entire film.    It had all the intrigue of playing open handed bridge.For all the raves I've read about Matt Damon's performance, I found it rather uneven.  Sometimes he came across as a clever mastermind and at others a wounded puppy.  It seemed like he wasn't really sure how to play the character.  Again, I put the responsibility for this on Minghella.  I'd call it a generally good performance of a difficult character, but not even close to his dynamism in Good Will Hunting'. This was a shining moment for Jude Law who gave a career performance as Dickie.  He basically stole the show out from under Damon's nose.  He endowed his character with exuberance, and a cavalier live-for-today attitude that made him charismatic despite his callousness and irresponsibility.  I enjoyed his performance in the unheralded Music From Another Room' but this one was even better.  If he keeps improving like this, he will be a force to be reckoned with.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of Law's performance and the cinematography.  The telling of the story fell flat and robbed this film of its real potential.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
97,roedyg,Subtle,9,20 May 2007,"This movie works on many levels. The biggest appeal is the ambiguity. The characters themselves are not clear what they believe. The gay relationship between Dicky and Tom shimmers as you try to look at it because they alternate between accepting and rejecting it.Tom Ripley is caught in a web of complex lies as he tries to pretend to be both himself and the man he murdered. He is such a likable murderer, you are on pins and needles as is his repeatedly almost discovered.The background is Italy which adds so much visual richness.The actors, even the bit players are superb. Ripley's deceptions cause painful waves in the lives of many people. They are all convincing and you care about their pain.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
98,moviesleuth2,Superior acting carries the film,7,25 January 2008,"Films that are carried by the performances by the actors are usually character pieces that focus primarily on the actors, like ""Junebug,"" or many independent films. ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is such a film, although it does have a twisted plot that services the characters as much as the film itself.Not wanting to spoil the movie, I'll describe as much as I can. Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) has an uncanny skill of imitating people (their voices, forging signatures, etc). So one day, a wealthy man (James Rebhorn) offers Tom $1000 including expenses to pose as an old college friend of his son, Dickie (Jude Law), and persuade him to come home. Dickie has been living a life that everyone would envy. Living in luxury in beautiful coastal Italy and sending all the bills to dear old Dad. So Tom goes to Italy with his false persona to complete his task, but things don't go as planned.That's really all I can give. It's an engaging story, one that has the marks of a thriller, but is too slow moving to be one. Not that this makes this film fail. While it's not exactly a movie that will get the adrenaline pumping, it is good as a drama, which is probably the intent. In my opinion, this was probably a good decision, because the setting just feels like a place where anyone would love to buy a summer home there. Director Anthony Minghella allows the viewer to completely soak in all of the atmosphere and the beauty of Italy, which would not be possible if it had the suspense of ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Furthermore, it helps us understand the characters, because hell, if I were there, I wouldn't want to leave either.If there is any reason to see this movie, it's for the acting. The performances by the three main characters (Cate Blanchett got some top billing, but she was barely in it-a point I'll get to later) are outstanding. Matt Damon is terrific as Tom, whose instability is well-illustrated. This is not the pretty-boy Matt Damon that many people are used to. He's a geeky kind of guy, complete with gangly teeth and glasses. It's a great performance, except that when he tries to be creepy, he doesn't succeed as well as he wants to. Gwyneth Paltrow is in top form here as Dickie's fiancée Marge. This is easily her best performance, much better than her Oscar-winning turn in the previous year's ""Shakespeare in Love"" (How she won an Oscar for that movie I'll never know...). At first she seems to be just as much of a snob as her lover, but as we get to know her, we realize that she's not (at least not like Dickie). One of her best scenes is where she describes to Tom how loving Dickie is as painful as it is great. When he pays attention to you, it feels as if you have everything, but when he doesn't, you feel so alone. Or something like that. But the way she says it (and in conjunction with Law's performance) is a perfect example of Dickie. When she's with him, she's happy, but when she's not, she's really lonely. Cate Blanchett is great (her American accent is flawless), but she's on screen too little to be developed very much. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jack Davenport have smaller roles, but are just as good. Watch for a brief appearance by the always great Philip Baker Hall.But the real joy of the film is Jude Law. His performance is the definition of a breakout role. This is as it should be, because Law is tremendously talented. Here he is a complete knockout. He's a spoiled brat who cares about people only when it suits him, but he doesn't resort to the stuffy rich snob cliché that populates many movies. Often he's pretty sympathetic. When he pays attention to Tom, he's a great guy, but we don't really notice what an asshole he is until later. In fact, he's so great that he upstages everyone else, which considering the quality of the performances, is pretty impressive.This is a great character piece. It's marketed as a thriller, so if that was what it was intended to be as, then it failed in that respect. But it works as a drama, so if you keep that in mind, it's a well spent 2 hours.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

100,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: Too slow paced for me,5,29 December 2004,"The Talented Mr. Ripley features some great acting, and it's an interesting glimpse into the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Unfortunately, there were two serious flaws in the film.First off, I didn't feel I understood Ripley's motivations. Is he a genius or just fumbling through? I wasn't able to identify with and root for Ripley for reasons I can't reveal, not wanting to spoil the film. A character who stumbles and gets pushed around is an anti-hero. A character who thinks and acts is more worth watching.Secondly, I have to admit that although I enjoy an intelligent film, and I enjoy art and drama... I have little patience for melodrama. There were too many long scenes in this film, and at times I didn't think the plot was going anywhere. A typical story arc sets up a goal or conflict and the characters fight and push and struggle to resolve that conflict. The Talented Mr. Ripley is only partly like this.Who should see this film:-- Arty types. You folks have quite a little racket going in making the rest of us feel inadequate because we want a film to have compelling characters and move forward.-- Matt Damon or Jude Law fans. Come on, you know you have to! If you're expecting a gripping thriller, may I suggest Breakdown or Arlingtown Road instead.

101,SquigglyCrunch,An Engaging Premise and Outstanding Performances All Around,8,6 December 2016,"The Talented Mr. Ripley follows Tom Ripley as he poses as another person and is sent to another country to convince someone to return home to his father, but things go differently than expected. The acting is one of the best aspects of the movie. I don't know how Matt Damon got known for action movies, he proves here that he can do drama extremely well. And I've seen it before, this guy knows how to act. Jude Law is very good as well, but even better was Gwyneth Paltrow. She does a fantastic job of showing the shift in her character from the beginning to the end of the film, and while at first she may seem cheesy and overdone, by the end she's quite simply fantastic. The movie challenges itself on multiple occasions. It throws itself into situations that could only end poorly and it leaves the audience slightly on edge, curious as to how the scenario will play out. It's very good at keeping the story interesting and moving along, and very often an aura of panic washes over the entire film. If I have but one flaw it's that the movie, despite being filled with panic and intrigue, isn't exactly tense. I'm not entirely sure why, everything was there, but during the scenes where I should have been sitting on the edge of my seat, I found myself relaxed and trying to figure out what's going to happen instead. While this wasn't always the case, I found that it could be, although it didn't affect the movie for me until after finishing it. Overall The Talented Mr. Ripley is an intriguing dramatic thriller with great performances, an interesting premise and presentation, and a great overall atmosphere. If the movie had been a little more edge-of-your-seat intense I might have liked it more, but regardless it was thoroughly enjoyable. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

103,SKG-2,Thoughtful psychological study or perversely entertaining? Your pick,10,29 December 1999,"Patricia Highsmith's original novel is about a charming, amoral man who already has all the elements in place before he does his terrible deeds, and while Rene Clement's adaptation, PURPLE NOON(1960) doesn't show us Ripley before he came to Europe, Alain Delon certainly was all amoral charm.  In his adaptation, Anthony Minghella takes on a different tack, showing us Tom Ripley before he became the Talented Mr. Ripley(just as last year's ELIZABETH showed Elizabeth before she became The Virgin Queen; by coincidence, both films star Cate Blanchett).  When a filmmaker tries to add psychological depth to what is generally pulp entertainment, it doesn't always work, but Minghella has pulled it off, while keeping it entertaining.There have been some people who think Matt Damon is too colorless here.  In Clement's adaptation, that might have been true, but the point here is Ripley is SUPPOSED to be a nonentity, a blank page waiting to be filled(thus lines like ""I always figured it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody,"" or when Dickie Greenleaf(Jude Law) tells Ripley that with his glasses on, he looks like Clark Kent) by someone like Dickie.  Ripley may have been pretending from day one(which is how he gets to meet Dickie in the first place), but there was nothing sinister about it, just a bunch of little white lies.  It's not till he gets entranced by the life in Italy, and Dickie's life in particular, and then finds himself shut from it, that things happen.  And Damon is excellent at going through the transformation(and it's not just the glasses, as one comment suggested, it's the hair, the clothes, and the whole attitude).Anthony Lane of The New Yorker, probably my favorite critic today, liked the film, but he thought it would have been better if Damon and Law had switched roles.  Again, if Minghella was remaking Clement's version, sure, but not this way.  If you want someone to be an object of desire, you better make sure they're desirable, and Law is quite good there, along with showing the layers underneath.  Gwyneth Paltrow has the tougher role, because she has to be both smart and able to be fooled, but she pulls it off, especially in the scene when she tells Tom she really knows what he is.  Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman are also good in small roles, James Rebhorn is dependable, and Philip Baker Hall makes a memorable cameo.One more thing; there have also been complaints that the first half is too long, and the ending is weak.  The first half not only sets up Ripley's slowly falling in love with Dickie's life(and even Dickie), but also sets up some plot points which pay off later, so it's necessary.  And when Ripley finally becomes The Talented Mr. Ripley, it's unsettling and still delivers a perverse kick.  As for the ending, without giving anything away, it's the only way it could end; he goes on, but at what cost?  This is terrific moviemaking.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

A wealthy shipbuilder mistakes him for an old classmate of his son and Princeton graduate, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law).

Impressed by his own ability to fool the stranger, the talented Mr. Ripley travels to Italy and embarks on a risky journey of persuasion.The beautiful landscapes (of Venice, Tuscany, the Gulf of Naples, and southern Sicily, among other locations); the friendly girlfriend, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow); and the enviable popularity of the handsome Dickie (as with his ""bon vivant"" friend Freddie, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) overwhelm Tom and amuse the viewer. Motivated by a dangerously potent and well-repressed desire to possess the very lifestyle Dickie personifies (a desire which is subtly and shyly represented with scattered innuendoes of homosexuality), Tom realizes that being with Dickie is not as promising a reward as becoming Dickie. Parting from the overly simplistic premise and main character's motto, ""it's better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody"", The Talented Mr. Ripley focuses more on its main character's abilities than on his need for a different identity; a choice which does not allow for a fuller development of this potentially intriguing character.Otherwise, the film successfully transmits the lifestyle Tom longs for, as a result of the better-defined character of Dickie, and of the desirability the actor Jude Law effectively projects.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
106,ethanbresnett,One of Damon's best,8,1 September 2021,"The Talented Mr. Ripley excels in so many areas.It has a terrific central premise which will be sure to keep you on your toes and glued to your screen. It is full of twists and turns thanks to the unscrupulous behaviour of our eponymous protagonist, played excellently by Matt Damon. The character of Ripley is just so intriguing that it's impossible not to enjoy trying to figure him out and guess his next move.The film is also stacked with a tremendous supporting cast, with the likes of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law and Cate Blanchett. All of them are superb and all of the characters brilliantly written.My only real criticism is that I found this film perhaps a little messy in areas. It didn't always flow particularly well and felt a bit jumpy in parts.This doesn't in any way take away from the numerous triumphs. A brilliant and unique thriller which will be sure to draw you in.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
107,moviemanMA,The Talented Mr. Damon,8,13 July 2005,"Obsession can be a scary thing. When a person's talent is getting inside someone to learn how they act, talk, and even write their name, one might get to know them or even like them. A person just might want to be them.In Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley, Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley, a man who plays the piano in New York. By borrowing a friends jacket from Princeton, a man by the name of Mr. Greenleaf mistakes Tom as an alumni of Princeton. Tom plays along and eventually is offered a job for $1000 dollars to bring back his son Dickie (Jude Law) from Europe. Tom agrees not knowing what he has just gotten himself into.In Italy, Tom finds Dickie along with his girl Marge (Gweneth Paltrow) sitting on the beach. Tom plays it off like he knows him from Princeton. This is the beginning of the their friendship. What Dickie finds out from Tom is that Tom is a master of impersonations and forgery. Dickie is stunned when Tom impersonates Dickie's father perfectly. With Tom mooching off of Dickies money, Tom doesn't really do his job of bringing back Dickie. The three sail around Italy.What happens next is Tom's attempt of becoming Dickie. He wears some of his clothes and does whatever Dickie does whether it be listening to jazz or sailing. Dickie's secret is that he has affairs with other women behind Marge's back. Tom is startled but keeps it a secret. Dickie and Tom have become ""brothers"" it seems. Sharing secrets, hanging out all the time, it begins to wear down on Dickie. Tom has become annoying, boring, and even a little homosexual around Dickie. Dickie is at the breaking point and Tom has no idea.Writer/director Anthony Minghella has taken Patricia Highsmith's novel and transformed it into a must see movie. Nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Actor (Jude Law), this film isn't ordinary by any means. Superb acting from Damon, Law, and Paltrow brings this movie to life. Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the friend of Dickie even gives a nice performance. Damon is incredible as Tom Ripley. Such passion in his role makes Ripley come to life. His duel character at times is incredible.The Talented Mr. Ripley is a great movie to watch on many levels. ""Everybody has got to have a talent,"", and Minghella's talent for story telling is phenomenal.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
108,PyrolyticCarbon,"Excellent performances and clever story, wonderful to watch the first time",9,24 December 2004,"I watched this for the second time, and unfortunately it had lost some of its surprise that it held the first time I saw it, knowing nothing of what was about to happen. Still it struck me how excellent the cast are in this movie and how these could be well regarded amongst their best roles.Matt Damon shows how flawed and slightly off kilter his character is, and as time progresses the audience is put at more and more unease until they are suddenly hit with reality and see Damon for what he really is. At the same time he's seen as a flawed character who craves the new found friendship he has but after one quick decision his world wraps closer and closer around him causing him to move further away from reality and to a world of deception.Gwenyth Paltrow and Jude Law play the other leads excellently each showing their growing concern with Damon's character and Law showing how cold and focused on his own interests he can really be in a role. Cate Blanchett is wonderful to look at, as always, and I do mean for her acting talent, with Philip Seymour Hoffman bringing to life another wonderful character on screen.The story walks along, never really running too much, and keeps you going along with an even pace taking you along with Ripley on his slow descent and watching as his mind calculates what to do at each major obstacle. It's fascinating to watch Damon during this performance, he manages to be awkward, self doubting and confused while deciding and then suddenly spring to life with purpose and conviction, often the coldness that showed in Law's main character trait is taken as his.Excellent performances, wonderful story and settings, and well worth the watch, especially the first time.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
109,TheAll-SeeingI,Matt Damon's Leap to Any Role He Wants,9,14 November 2019,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" recounts the hedonistic yet still-sensual glamour of 1950's Italy, and its one-time status as an escapist playground for affluent, young American men.Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) casts his gaze on Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), a charmed and charming jet setter with a gorgeous young girlfriend (Gwyneth Paltrow), and an abundance of both confidence and cash. It first starts back in New York, where Dickie's dad commissions Ripley -- whom he mistakes as a Princeton pal of Dickie's -- to journey to Italy to fetch his son and bring him back stateside. Ripley soon falls in love with Dickie and his opulent lifestyle; as an audience, we're placed inside Ripley's thoughts as an open invitation to feel his deep jealousy and burgeoning excitement, while at the same time recognizing his alarming desire to project as someone other than his true self. Ultimately, this warping of mind comes at the expense of Dickie's continued existence on the planet, and this is where ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" eschews its promise of a full-blown psychological drama by taking on more traditional thriller constructs.How wrong so many of us were early in Damon's career, when it was assumed he'd follow Hollywood typecasting to a productive yet potentially narrow career. Instead, he thrives to this day as an A-list actor, and while writing his own tickets. It's most assuredly his (literally) killer performance in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" that showcased his unassailable ability to embody a uniquely layered, against-type role, and at an elite level. A highly engaging film. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)",The Talented Mr. Ripley
110,dead47548,One of the all-time best.,10,9 January 2008,"Another masterpiece complete with a bounty of intricate layers from the genius mind of Anthony Minghella. The film is a noirish triller yet it is also a perfectly crafted character study. As with most of Minghella's work, the bulk of the film lies in contrasts between characters. First there is the contrast between Ripley and Dickie. Ripley is a poor man who has lived his entire life in isolation, and dreams of having a life like Dickie's. Dickie, though, takes his wonderful life for granted. On the surface he is a joyous man who basks in the magnificence of his life, and Ripley loves this. He does whatever he can to become best friends with Dickie.But slowly, Ripley realizes that Dickie isn't the perfect man he originally thought him to be. He takes everything for granted, and this is mainly displayed through Marge. She is the perfect woman in Ripley's eyes, and he is jealous that Dickie can be with such a flawless creation. However, he sees that Dickie doesn't care about her at all. He sleeps with other women, and doesn't appreciate Marge for the glorious woman she truly is. This begins Ripley's turn towards Dickie.The arrival of Freddie is a catalyst for the complete shift of Ripley and Dickie's relationship. The contrast of Freddie and Ripley is also a very interesting one. Ripley is a relatively dull man who takes everything in and appreciates what he has. Freddie, on the other hand, is extremely charismatic yet, much like Dickie, takes his luxuries and good fortune for granted. He is an immature, disrespectful man and Ripley sees this from the start. But Dickie becomes more drawn to Freddie's charisma, as a result of being so close to Ripley's dullness for so long. This makes Ripley even more angry, and it also leads Dickie to the realization that his friendship with Ripley has really played itself out and he has nothing left to gain from it. So, when Dickie decides to end their friendship, all of the bottled up anger and thoughts between the two of them come out and it ultimately leads to Dickie's death.Instead of being overwhelmed with guilt and pain, Ripley sees this as an opportunity to live the life that Dickie took for granted. He takes over his life and lives it to it's fullest. In this fake life that he has created for himself, he even finds his own Marge in the form of Meredith. The similarities between the two of them are overwhelming, through appearance, personality, even the fact that their first names start with an M. But living his life as Dickie becomes more and more difficult for Ripley. Marge becomes increasingly suspicious when she runs into Ripley at the opera and his stories become more and more unbelievable, especially to the whereabouts of Dickie.This all comes to another climax when Freddie comes back into the picture and realizes that Ripley is leading a fake life as Dickie. This leads to another necessary death in order for Ripley to keep his perfect life alive. But with another death comes more complications, and as Marge continues to be suspicious, the police start to close in on the truth. Ripley takes an opportunity to pick up and leave, leaving behind a suicide note as Dickie which claims that he also killed Freddie. However, Dickie's father hires a private investigator to investigate these curious deaths.Eventually, everything sorts itself out perfectly for Ripley as Dickie's past comes to haunt him and everything becomes cleaned up with everyone believing that Dickie committed suicide and was responsible for the murder of Freddie. Marge, however knows the truth and all of her initial thoughts on Ripley are completely shifted into sheer hatred. Ripley ignores this though, and starts a new life with Marge's friend Peter. But living a life of lies still haunts him as Meredith finds him, believing him to be Dickie, on a yacht vacation with Peter.So, once again another murder must be committed to keep himself free from prosecution. This one proves to be the most emotionally painful for him yet because, since Meredith is with people who have already seen Ripley there, he has to kill the new love of his life Peter who has done absolutely nothing wrong. The abrupt ending is certainly one of my favorites. It shows that Ripley's life of pain and isolation will never end due to his greed and life of deceit. The mistakes of his past ensure that he will never find complete happiness and the final image is one of pain and absolute isolation.I didn't even talk about the performances, which are all amazing seeing as it's one of the greatest casts of all time. From Damon all the way down to Philip Baker Hall, everyone knocks their part out of the park. Jude Law's charismatic, seductive portrayal is surely the highlight as we delve further and further into his ultimately dark and selfish character. Damon, Paltrow and Philip Seymour Hoffman also deliver very praise-worthy performances. Definitely one of my favorite films.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

112,Rammstein-2,Brilliant and impressive,8,27 February 2000,"There are many reasons to like this film. Despite being just a bit overlong (the beginning is a bit tedious), these are my main reasons: excellent photography, stunning performances by the actors and a brilliant plot.Matt Damon is a very talented actor and performs at his best in this movie, as the confused and somewhat dependent Tom Ripley, who lives his life more or less in the life of others. Jude Law is also excellent as the artificial and self-loving Dickie Greenleaf.I like the way the story builds up and then comes crashing down on Tom Ripley, who surely didn't want to kill his friend, and how he is locked in a complex scam to come clean. It doesn't work very well, as you can imagine. I just love the way it was impossible to know what was going to happen - which person he was going to kill next. It was nerve-racking.But sitting in a theater with chairs almost a decade old makes the experience seem less in a way, because I was squirming and trying to find a better way to sit after an hour already. And the beginning is, like I said, a bit long, so I was really starting to have second thoughts about seeing this film. But in the end, I was gratified. A brilliant film worth seeing.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
113,mdm-11,Visually/Acustically Stunning -- Disturbing Story,7,30 May 2005,"After the fanfare for this critically acclaimed box office smash had died down, I finally got to see ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". The breathtaking location cinematography (filmed in various historic Italian cities), meticulously transformed into late 1950s authenticity, along with stunning period costume designs an alluring Jazz score, this film has many elements of a soon to be classic. Matt Damon is convincing (which may not be a good thing) as the liar/identity thief/murderer with seemingly no scruples about his loathsome doings. Fans may be turned off by the character's darkness. Hints at the two male lead characters' homosexuality add to the apparent aimlessness of the story. Watching ""Mr. Ripley"" can be compared to a roller coaster ride that ends with all cars getting stuck somewhere near the top of the coaster, wondering ""what was that?"". The production values will satisfy even those who don't quite ""get it"". There definitely are some loose ends that nobody bothered to fully explain.Fans of classic cinema who look for colorful production values (a la Three Coins In The Fountain) will enjoy this otherwise very unusual (thus not for everyone's taste) film. Not suitable for pre-teens due to brief but extreme violence and sexual situations.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
114,Mort-31,Minghella does a great job again,8,3 August 2001,"I've never read any Highsmith novels before, but now I'm going to! The story is fantastic. It needs some time to get going, but then it upholds suspense for almost the last two hours, until the very last scene. You may call it a classical crime-suspense thriller, but it is one of highest quality.Anthony Minghella who has already shown that he is capable in transferring literature onto the screen, does a great job again. The story is perfectly understandable without knowledge of the book and cinematic elements don't come off badly: especially music and cinematography (lovely pictures of Italian towns) are used sympatheticly. What I don't agree with, is his casting this time. Matt Damon, for whom Will Hunting was the ideal role, has a too stiff face, and the difficult and complex character of Tom Ripley asks more of him than he is able to give. The rest of the cast is okay, Philip Seymour Hoffman even surprised me: He played a role quite untypical for him.Again, Minghella has chosen a real STORY for a film, which is rare unfortunately. Watch `The Talented Mr. Ripley'. Or read the book. Just this once it doesn't make any difference.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
115,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,"Wait till you see the Spanish steps, wait five minutes, then press Stop",6,7 January 2014,"W/d Minghella takes Patricia Highsmith's thriller about a small-time trickster who gets a chance at a big score, and turns it into a bright, loud, Felliniesque entertainment with lots of Italian sun and glittering blue water. He adds a few extra characters, tinkers with the storyline a bit, and it plays very well for a while. Some of the tinkering seems inspired (Dickie Greenleaf, the object of Ripley's obsession, is a musician instead of a painter, which leads to a great scene in an underground jazz club), and the setup is quite involving as long as it stays open-ended. After Ripley makes his move, however, the film starts to lose momentum, and pretty soon, in the words of a great director, you've got a dead shark on your hands Minghella doesn't do much with the psychological aspects of Highsmith's novel—sociopath, psychopath, homeopath, seems like it's all the same to him. There's one last brilliant sequence, worthy of Hitchcock, in which Ripley turns up twice at the same café, once as himself, once as Dickie G., within the space of a couple of minutes. After that, I'd suggest watching with one finger poised above the Stop button. We stayed with it to the end, and we were sorry we did. The Italian locations have rarely looked lovelier; performances are all first rate; Gwyneth's big scene toward the end doesn't really work, but I don't think that's her fault.

Fine performances by all too including Jude Law's Academy award nomination as Dickie.  Damon is also fantastic as well playing such an enigma of a character.  Also it had a great set of post world war II Europe, and I loved the setting.Rating 8 out of 10",The Talented Mr. Ripley
117,shanayneigh,Better than the book,9,18 December 2020,"I really like this movie, and have seen it several times. I have only recently read the book, which isn't bad but not as good as this movie.This movie is a masterclass in adaptation. There is far more tension in the movie than in the novel. The invention of Meredith Logue, who isn't in the novel, changing the nature of Peter Smith-Kingsley, and making Marge more suspicious against Ripley, especially at the end, all work in the movie's favor.We spend more time with Ripley in New York in the book than in the movie. He arrives in Italy at around page 40 in a circa 250 page novel.Their time in Mongibello is quite similar. The sub plot with Dickie's relationship with a local girl isn't in the book, which is a shame because it adds to his character.The murder of Dickie completely changes the character of Ripley. In the movie it's more or less a crime of passion, of Ripley lashing out in anger after being rejected by Dickie. In the book it's cold blooded and premeditated murder. The argument they have in the boat in the movie, they have earlier in the book, leading Ripley to get Dickie in the boat for the purpose of murdering him. I'm not sure which version I like best, to be honest. The book version is closer to the Ripley character in the book sequels (which aren't very good).The movie differs quite substantially from the book after this point, and in particular after the murder of Freddie Miles. And there is no doubt that the movie is the better one. A whole sub plot of the investigation of falsified signatures is taken out, and it is not missed. The ending of the book doesn't make much sense, whereas the movie ties everything together nicely.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
118,Quicksand,Beautifully Done,9,9 January 2000,"Well paced, acted and directed.  It succeeded in every scene, in making me think what I was supposed to... either siding with Ripley, or against him, marveling how his ""talents"" do or do not help him.Tough to say much without giving anything away.  Excellent filmmaking, Anthony Minghella is another rare talent.  Well-worth seeing, a great conversation movie.9/10",The Talented Mr. Ripley
119,Silverzero,"Luscious, glossy, but dramatically thin identity thriller.",2,13 June 2003,"The topic of homosexual obsession isn't a very attractive one, nor does it seem like anything that doesn't belong in bizarre French Cinema. `The Talented Mr. Ripley' is the latest such movie. The main visible problem is the fact that the characters, dialogue, script etc., are all overthrown by the polished Italian settings. The film is just an excuse to showcase these luscious landscapes and barely sticks to the plot. It achieves the slick, old fashioned manner it attempts at, but is so dispersed and un-definitive that you really don't know what to make of it.The movie works quite well up until it reaches the mid-point. Up till then, the plot was linear and easy to comprehend, but immediately after Dickie Greenleaf is killed (and no, that's not a spoiler. You're supposed to know that), the plot goes all over the place falling in to one plot hole after another in the clumsiest fashion. Then again, some scenes are just too sensually bizarre to comprehend (e.g. the bathtub scene (shudder)).
There's a glamorous and easily recognisable cast of faces, but with this quality of stars the overall standard should have been much better than it was. Matt Damon takes on the title role as complex, two-faced homosexual Tom Ripley. Obviously this part isn't as straightforward (pardon the pun) as most of his characters, but he's a suitable lead. Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow does surprisingly little in her significant other role. She gets plenty of conviction but ignores this and instead chooses to smile in the background (oh that Gwyneth).Jude Law received an Academy Award nomination and much critical plaudits for his role as the rich playboy. I can't honestly say that he deserved this treatment as I thought his performance was superfluous, vain and highly over-rated. Cate Blanchett is woefully under-challenged in what seems like a bit part, and Phillip S. Hoffman doesn't get much of a chance to flesh out his character.`The Talented Mr. Ripley' is branded as a thriller, but it's too upper class to be categorised alongside `dictionary definition' thrillers like `Die Hard'. It can be compared closer to `Gosford Park' better than anything else. It starts out very promising with a lot of potential, but completely loses it in the second half, going in a hopeless downward spiral into nonsense. `The Talented Mr. Ripley' is one for French Cinema fans only, at best.

124,fimimix,..a thrilling drama all around..,10,29 July 2006,"Some of the reviews written here are so poetic and eloquently defining, there is not much left to write - except to repudiate those snide comments some people posted. They were not able to grasp the many-layered complexities of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" - I've watched it at least six times and still feel uncertain of my opinions, that I've misunderstood some of it. Although it was released in 1999, it is definitely like one of the great movies that were made in the '60s-'70s era. Nothing was left-out to make it into the gripping, totally convincing film it is. The cinematography was stunning, as was the lighting. Each character was costumed as they should have been for every scene. I loved the way each scene melted into the next, making a complete whole. Anthony Mingella knew exactly what he wanted and got it with the cooperation of every actor/actress, right down to the extras and bit-players. Every character was completely developed. Frankly, I can't imagine anyone else playing the roles as they were presented, and most of them I was not familiar with. I saw this film before ""Good Will Hunting"" (liked it, too), and see the brilliance of Matt Damon's multi-faceted acting. I also enjoyed both of ""the Bourne"" movies, hoping he isn't stuck in that kind of role forever. I sincerely hope there are many writers busy scripting stories for him, although I think ""Ocean's Eleven"" was a waste for him.I'm sure Minghella realized he almost ruined this sumptuous film by considering Tom Cruise as Ripley - Yuck !! Gwenyth Paltrow was perfect for her role (see ""Great Expectations""), too, her facial expressions and tone of voice right on pitch for every emotion. Cate Blanchett is another jewel in this crown, proving there IS great talent there - her timing was sublime with just the right touch of wanting to believe Ripley's saga, but just enough disbelief to make it convincing. One is certain, had the film continued, she would have seen the entire misery. Phillip S. Hoffman was truly a revelation; my first opinion that he was a homophobe - making several snide remarks to Ripley - but, the scene at the piano when he is looking for ""Rickie"", with his wrist so risquely bent, gives an entirely different characteristic to his role. (See ""Red Dragon""). I'm not familiar with Jack Davenport, but what a revealing, under-played gay-man he delivered; he may have been the only one to understand Ripley's torment, much to his undoing. Alessandro Fabrizi as the detective who confronts Ripley in Venice was just as intense as he should have been (see ""Hannibal""). What more to say about the skill from all of the other actors/actresses? - applause, please.As for Jude Law, he should have been that physically beautiful in ""Midngiht in the Garden of Good and Evil"", in which he played an openly-sinister gay hustler. His facial expression to the perception of Ripley's infatuation for him during the bathtub ""chess-game"" was transparent. I agree he should have been nominated for best supporting-actor....actually everyone in the film should have won one. This movie is flawless - those people who panned it because of the gay theme don't know too much about anyone other than themselves. It is tragic they don't realize there are so many tortured people like Ripley - perhaps minus the violence - because they have no perception of the human psyche.No one mentioned Ripley's agony of leaving his beautiful piano behind - pianos were vital to three scenes, opening the movie with that wonderful theme. Some reviewers caught the many personalities Ripley suffered through-out his entire life, and I agree his New York persona should have been expanded - another ten minutes added to the film would matter not, entrancing as it is.The ending of the movie leaves me completely drained, because it is obvious Ripley would have to continue his tragic behavior.....he didn't have to worry about money anymore, although he couldn't live ""Rickie's"" life, although IT too was deeply-flawed psychosomatic. Matt Damon's portrayal was magnificent; I can't think of one other actor through the decades I've been watching movies who could bring more to this role.....not one.AS a performer, I can also easily adjust to radical changes in my life, very similar to Ripley - yet, I can hardly kill a fly. My age has shown me that I am acting from one scene to the next, with no damage to psyche nor hurting another being. There are millions just like us - they just don't realize it. It's not bad - each day is different, adding its own magic to a very good life. People who really study this movie will recognize a little of themselves in it - ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" should be at the top of the list for IMDb's best movies - I'm waiting for another.....",The Talented Mr. Ripley
125,Aly200,"Suspenseful Story, Well Acted and Masterfully Directed",8,2 February 2017,"Academy Award winning director Anthony Minghella once again assembles an all star cast in his adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's bestselling thriller about a duplicitous youth who is sent to fetch a wayward young millionaire from Italy. The story turns darker when the titular Mr. Ripley's numerous lies and secrets begin to surface forcing the young man to resort to deadly methods to hide the treacherous truths.In the pivotal role of Tom Ripley is an ever charismatic Matt Damon, pulling out all the stops to play such a wicked character who we can't help but be attracted to. Tom Ripley is such an enigma that we never really learn where he is actually from or why he does so many horrible things and Damon maintains the air of a faux gentleman. The actor even took time to learn piano which is a key element to throwing Tom into the narrative when Tom is overheard playing at an elite party where Mr. Herbet Greenleaf hears the young man and assumes that Tom knew his son, Dickie (Tom wears a borrowed Yale jacket which was where Dickie attended college before leaving for Italy) which Tom lies about. Damon even lends his singing chops to a song or two for the film's lighter moments. Throughout the film, Damon manages to play a vast range of emotions from confidence to fearful of discovery to murderously methodical all while sporting a seemingly innocent charisma masking a veil of a youth scared of being discovered for his falsehoods. The film boasts a talented supporting cast in the likes of Jude Law (Oscar nominated for his effort) as Dickie Greenleaf, the unfortunate target of Ripley's dark ambitions, Gwyenth Paltrow (far less irritating than usual) as Dickie's girlfriend, Marge Sherwood who becomes suspicious of Tom's motives, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dickie's friend, Freddie Miles who gets too close to the truth and pays a steep price, Jack Davenport (most famous for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy) in an expanded role as Peter Smith-Kingsley, friend to Ripley after Ripley flees his dark actions but is the final casualty by the end of the film and Cate Blanchett as Meredith Logue, a fellow traveler who is also a victim of Ripley's lies but never finds out who Tom really is. Even minor players like the late James Rebhorn as Herbet Greenleaf and Philip Baker-Hall manage to make an impression.Director Minghella deftly adapts the story with a keen eye as he ramps the tension as Tom Ripley's lies begin to spiral out of control and he must resort to drastic measures to cover his tracks. As Tom's obsession with Dickie grows, we feel nervous and afraid for Dickie as we wonder what Tom will to get what he wants. Even when Tom commits horrible deeds, we fear for the villainous young man wondering if he will get caught. The film also exudes exquisite cinematography of its Italian landscapes that makes the setting a character of its own as the story's characters travel across the country from Venice to Rome and in-between on the canals and seas.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
126,ivanmessimilos,Underrated movie,8,21 April 2020,"The year 1999, in film terms, was remarkable and brilliant, offering us some unforgettable titles that we can safely say are classics (or will become so in a few years). American Beauty, The Matrix, Fight Club, The Sixth Sense, The Green Mile and at least a dozen other top-notch and really good works. That's why I think this movie could easily have gone under the radar for many. I recently looked at it again and it made an even better impression than when I first watched it.The Academy has shown some interest by awarding five nominations (none of which were a gold statue), including the one for Best Supporting Actor (Jude Law), and I personally will go so far as to say that Damon has been the most mature role of his entire career. The rest of the troupe is also on a high task (Paltrow, Blanchett, Hoffman).This is an adaptation
the first books in the series from Tom Ripley, a poor and unknown man who wants to make a fortune by assuming someone else's identity. Not even the first film adaptation, 1960's Purple Noon has this honor, but French cinema is not as popular as Hollywood.The concept of the film is interesting because the protagonist is at the same time the antagonist, he is intelligent, he longs for what the other has and does not rush to anything to reach his goal. This thriller is intriguing not only with complex and layered characters, a tense action or an unexpected twist, but because there is no idle or irrelevant scene, even those ""smaller"" scenes are important because they tell us about the character's condition and situation. At times, the movie looks like Hitchcock was involved at least as a producer because I felt his influence (accidentally or intentionally) on the director because of the way the movie was directed. Intriguing and suspenseful thrillers, though, were his forte.
Maybe because it's not a typical Hollywood thriller, maybe because we have to turn our brains on a little while watching, maybe because the main character is also the antagonist, these are all my reasons and explanations for why this movie didn't get enough love it deserves.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
127,lib-4,What's locked up in your closet?,9,6 January 2000,"Despite the fact that the film broke 10 minutes before the end, I was able to return to the theater and see the finish.  Matt Damon proved that he can play both romantic and dramatic.  He impressed me with the way he could switch from naive to cunning. Paltrow seemed a little wasted in the part- but the Jazz was great and the story compelling.Jude Law as Dickie personified everything both good and bad about Americans in Europe during the Jazz age- reminded me of a F. Scott Fitzgerald character.   I understand that there are more stories about Mr. Ripley- I would like to see a sequel.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
128,Shiva-11,Skillfully acted with gorgeous sets and scenery.,8,5 January 2000,"The Talented Mr. Ripley: Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a poor, piano tuner with a penchant for impersonations and forgery.   He is approached with a proposition; if he is willing to go to Italy and persuade Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) - the wayward son of a shipbuilding magnate - to return home, he will be paid handsomely.  In addition, Tom would travel in ultimate luxury and receive a stipend while on his mission.  Not surprisingly he leaps at the opportunity.  Within days of his arrival Tom falls under Dickie's spell and is reveling in his newfound bohemian lifestyle. Realizing that he is living a dream Tom decides that he never wants to go home.  The question of course is what is he willing to do to stay.   With an intelligent tightly written script, and some of the hottest young talent in Hollywood (all, according to screenwriter/director Anthony Minghella, cast before they became stars) not even meddling movie moguls could have ruined this film.  Add brilliant camerawork, great performances and gorgeous Italian backdrops and you will understand the Oscar buzz.Matt Damon thrives as the down and out nobody with a special gift, reminiscent of his role in Good Will Hunting.  Tom is a study in contrasts; cold, calculating, and driven, he is simultaneously vulnerable and prone to emotional outbursts.  Just when you think you know what he'll do next, he takes a different tack. and surprises you.  The supporting cast also does excellent work.Jude Law is excellent as the petulant, carefree Dickie.  Whether dabbling in jazz, sailing around Italy in his yacht or engaging in numerous trysts, he is the classic narcissist, quickly losing interest in people and things (we're not sure if he sees a difference between the two).  Although given minimal screen time, Cate Blanchett, is thoroughly engaging as the vacuous heiress whiling away her time and money because she thinks that's what she's supposed to do. Paltrow's character however is puzzling -  woefully underutilized her only purpose is to serve as a walking visual cue for the audience, letting the audience know when to laugh or be shocked. 
That criticism notwithstanding, this is an excellent film that will impress.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The scenery, costumes, and overall performances are quite good and helped me for the most part enjoy this film. In particular I thought Jude Law gave an effortless yet excellent performance. Matt Damon on the other hand I think was miscast and too cloddish in his performance. It is this shortcoming that is the greatest detraction to this film. It's a shame because everything else is so good, and Damon can act for sure, I just don't Ripley is the role for him.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Gwyneth Paltrow lacks any alluring quality that would make the men go gaga. Jude Law, on the other hand, shows a full range of emotions as a spoiled playboy. Cate Blanchett inhabits any character she portrays. She probably should have played Marge. The scenery is gorgeous, and the 1950s sets and costumes are spot on. Great story, just not handled as well as it deserved to be.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Genre: Drama, Suspense, Thriller
Format: Widescreen, Color
Director: Anthony Minghella
Starring: Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour HoffmanI actually was having a tough time with the first 10 or 12 minutes of this movie. I was ready to throw the D grade. I saw glaring mistakes, like the zooming-binoculars-shot that has been in movies forever, but is impossible and I don't know why they do it. You know, they put a fake outline of the binoculars view over the shot and this movie even did a zoom, which looks so fake..... bad, bad, bad. A couple editing mistakes and sloppy set-up scenes pop up early too. But, than the film takes an interesting turn and gets good.We are introduced to a man, who appears to have a great life set-up for him, but a menagerie of sexual confusion erupts for him and it sets off a chain of events that take you through the rest of the film. There is a nicely handled pseudo-ending. This is a film with excellent character development. So good, that the story demanded a change of identities and a very healthy character mish-mash erupted. The confusion was nice to experience. Along with that, beautiful European architecture enhances the sophisticated and the rich people, that populate the story. Venice! Rome! Damon was good. He gave us a very creepy character.8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",The Talented Mr. Ripley
132,ThomasColquith,Disappointing,4,12 October 2021,"I just now watched ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and I wish I had not, because it is not very good. It is a depressing slog of a movie. I only stuck with it because I liked the scenery and cinematography, and there was some good music too, and Jude Law nailed his role, but the pacing was slow and the plot itself was not as intricate as I expected and left me wanting a better ending. This film was like ""Nightcrawler"" to me, in that it was well made but is not a good plot, who wants to watch 2 hours of a psychopathic murderer winning at life and even getting his victim's inheritance? And he was not even talented at it, he just lucks into everything. It really became hard to believe and too much of a slog watching all of his blunders and circumstances working out for him. And the whole latent homoeroticism was tiresome, either address it openly or not. Not a film that I would rewatch. 4/10.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
133,lotus_chief,The Talented Mr Ripley.....talented indeed!!!!,4,14 December 2003,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I shied away from this film because I don't care for Matt Damon.  Actually, he gets on my nerves.  That aside, this is his best role ever in my opinion. He really played the HELL out of Tom Ripley; the impersonations he did were uncanny.  What I loved about his character was how versatile he was, and VERY quick on his feet...even orchestrating things to go a certain way, where if anyone else faced with the same situation would get caught, he got away with it all (note the scene where he invited Marge & Meredith to the cafe, in each case pretending to be someone else).  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.  What I found funny was that I was actually rooting for Tom Ripley to get away with it all, when the film continues after Marge leaves with Dickey's father, I was praying for the film to end so that there would be no more time for Ripley to be found out! I had a BIG smile on my face when the credits finally rolled, because he had gotten away with it.  I thought it was really cool how everything just seemed to work out in his favor.  He was a pathetic person, in that he hated himself so much he felt he had to live other people's lives and then ultimately destroy them, but you still can't help but be on his side and hope he succeeds, and that is the genius of this film.  Matt Damon was perfect for this role, he had the look needed to pull off the calculating, cold-hearted, yet sensitive and self-hating Tom Ripley...his performance was flawless.  I was suprised that Damon wasn't nominated for an Oscar, but Jude Law was.  I didn't see the big deal with Law's performance, he was pretty good, but not that good.  Excellent film!***1/2 out of **** stars.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
134,dougandwin,Odd but intriguing,7,14 August 2009,"I must say that I found this film to be quite odd in many respects, yet it held my interest throughout, even to its unpredictable ending. Firstly, the performance of Matt Damon was very good, and I am sure was a factor in him getting the ""Bourne"" film roles. His ability to act the part of both Tom and Dickie showed his talent as being exceptionally good, despite many of the situations failed to ring true. It was good to see the early work of Cate Blanchett and Jude Law, despite them being fairly minor. I believe the scenery was a winner and made the film a joy photographically. This film is a part of the Patricia Highsmith trilogy on Tom Ripley, and is the far more interesting of the three.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
135,len-21,6 on a scale of 10,6,7 January 2000,"First things first. The acting was quite good in this movie. There I've said all the positive things I have to say.I don't have any idea what 60% of the voters on IMDB were watching to give this movie an 8, 9 or 10. And, for it to be nominated as best picture by the Golden Globes is utterly ridiculous.Ok, so some of my complaints are personal - for example I don't like dated movies very well - this one takes place in the 50's. (1/2 point off) And, I don't like movies that take place entirely overseas - this one was Italy (1/2 point off). But, even if those things weren't true, the very best this movie could garner would be a 7.For one thing, it was WAYYYYYYY too long! It may have only seemed like a lifetime, but it was darn close - 2:19. Now, I have seen plenty of 2:19 films which worked, but this movie would have been perfect at about 1:40. Dump the bulk of the wasted time prior to the first death. That would have helped tremendously. Talk about boring! (1 point off)The second major objection were the three unbelievable coincidences where key people just happened to run into each other in Italy. I mean, come one. Give me a break! At least give us a reason to think that a coincidence of that magnitude could have happened. And, for it to happen repeatedly is a joke! (1 point off)SPOILER ALERT: The third major problem was that the main character (Matt Damon) was a multiple murderer. We were supposed to like him - I think. But, how could we? He ruined everyone's life for purely selfish reasons - not the least of which were his pitiful homosexual tendencies. That left no one to like who wasn't already made miserable by him. (1 point off)And, the ending was highly questionable. It left the entire plot open ended. It resolved nothing. Now, if that is the way they wanted it to be so as to leave us with the idea that situations like this can never be resolved, then I guess fine. But, movies are ""supposed"" to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. I know I would NEVER go to a movie that I knew ahead of time didn't resolve itself - unless I knew it would have a sequel that I would want to see. And, believe me, there aren't enough stupid people left in Italy to fall for his scheme a second time around. I should have given it another point off for the ending, but I already voted.

137,danielll_rs,Hitchcock would be proud...,9,20 February 2000,"I respect tastes, but I don't believe that there is a person who doesn't like at least one Hitchcock film- ""Psycho"", ""Rear Window"", ""Vertigo"", ""The Birds"", whatever. And I also believe that 99% of people considerate Hitch as the greatest master of suspense of all time. However, his films were made not only of mystery, but also had a deep dramatic side. That's why his pictures were quite slow and without much action. His influences are present until nowadays, and we can see that clearly when we watch a superb film as ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". Based on Patricia Highsmith's novel and directed by Anthony Minghella (Oscar winner for the wonderful ""The English Patient""), the movie tells the story of Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a poor American young man who has an amazing talent for imitating another person and faking signatures. One day, he meets Mr. Greenleaf, who sends him to Italy in order to bring back to the US his son, Dickie (Jude Law), who lives in a village called Mongibello with his fiancée, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow). Tom and Dickie become friends, but some bad things will happen and everything will take an unpredictable way. The story may seems a little simple, but it is very complex. While Minghella repeats the brilliance of ""The English Patient"", showing wonderful images of Italy, stylish scenery and costumes and amazing music, he is able to discuss some very important subjects: friendship, envy, ambition, love, hate, murder, guilt. Many people want to have their friends' perfect life and when they see this film, even not agreeing with Ripley's methods, somehow they understand him.The acting of the film is one of its greatest points. While Matt Damon is brilliant as the strange Tom Ripley and Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett give great support, Jude Law plays perfectly the playboy Dickie Greenleaf, in an Oscar-worthy performance. ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a small masterpiece, not to be missed. It's well-written, clever, complex, intriguing, suspenseful, stylish, powerful, with a great, surprising final scene. Hitchcock would be proud of it. Unfortunately, ""Ripley"" was not nominated to best picture, and this was too unfair. Don't listen to the people who say that it is slow and boring. You won't be disappointed if you really love cinema.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

If you want to see a movie at this length, then by all means go see ""The Green Mile"" instead of the very dull ""Mr.Ripley"" movie!!But if you go , be prepared for a ton of jazz(i suspect the spundtrack is full of this music), a very long overhyped movie and some very beatiful shots of Venice,Rome and Italy!!!Otherwise wait for the video/DVD!!!",The Talented Mr. Ripley
139,Barky44,"Not Bad, But Is One Act Too Long",8,20 March 2007,"'The Talented Mr. Ripley' is a fairly interesting drama. I loathe to call it a ""thriller"", it does have some suspenseful, creepy moments, but it's not a thriller in the traditional, Hitchcockian sense. ""Drama"" fits it pretty well.It's entertaining enough. Matt Damon does a decent job playing wanna-be playboy Thomas Ripley, a self-proclaimed ""forger and impersonator"", assigned by a shipping magnate to recover wayward son Jude Law (who's been busy spending trust fund money cavorting around Italy). What follows is a tale of uneasy obsession that did make me cringe several times.The film takes an interesting approach in telling Ripley's story. The film is broken into several ""cycles"". We see Ripley infiltrate the rich son's life, and that arc is brought to a tragic conclusion. Then we see Ripley impersonate that rich son as he, too, cavorts through Europe. He then enmeshes himself into another wealthy socialite's (the ever-stunning Cate Blanchette) life, and manages to avoid disaster there. Then he works to elude the Italian police and an American private investigator. Then, at the end, he seemingly starts the cycle all over again with a bisexual orchestra conductor.I liked this method of storytelling: showing a villain as he progresses from crime to crime. I think it works well, and could be the basis for a great thriller down the road. Unfortunately, the character of Ripley simply can't hold this film for that long, and the film dies quietly before the final act. If the character was, say, the cinematic equivalent of Hannibal Lecter, it would be a great way to tell a story.But Ripley is no Lecter, and this film does run out of gas. This shows the lack of sensibility by the director and the editor. A skilled filmmaker, or artist of any type, needs to know when ""the end"" has come. Every project has a proper ending, crafting a great ending is the most difficult part of any story, and the filmmakers really made a mistake by letting this film go too long. They should have ended it when Ripley was released by the father and the private investigator. That was a decent scene and could have been crafted into a creepy ending. But they carry it on too far, and it falls flat after that.Oddly enough, the film also suffers when Jude Law's character leaves the script. I'm not much of a Jude Law fan, but in this film he really is the glue that holds the cast together. He plays the role of the ""center of attention"" really well, and when he's gone, the film does start to unravel. I guess he did deserve his award nominations for this film, he really was a pivotal presence in this film.One final note: the sets, scenes, costumes, and props were really top-notch. They did a great job recreating early 60's Italy.Overall, not a bad film. It goes on for one act too many, and it starts to weaken when Jude Law leaves the screen (a credit to the actor). 8 out of 10.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
140,donwc1996,Spine Chilling,10,11 July 2013,"This film is absolutely riveting from the first moment to the last. Matt Damon is positively smashing as Tom Ripley, grabbing the audience immediately and never letting go. You're with Tom every minute no matter what he does and he does plenty. Damon may very well be straight in real life, but here you never believe for a moment that he is, no matter who's in his arms - male or female. Damon's pan-sexual persona is so powerfully played out here that you wouldn't mind hopping in bed with him if half given the chance. He's that sparkling, like champagne bubbling over with foam. What a guy! What a performance! It's Damon's film and no one stands a chance next to him.

142,zfiany,Matt Damon has proved to be perfect for such roles,8,16 October 2009,This movie has shown the capabilities of Matt Damon and his fitness for such psychological roles. Talented Mr. Ripley is full of the details of the human psychology of the insecure person and the plot is intertwined in a very smart way. I say this and I am sure about it that there are nitty & gritty details that many people couldn't tie together in the movie and I remember asking my friends questions about details in the movie that they didn't know the answers to.I have to disagree with the point of view saying that roles should have been switched. The roles are perfectly matched and distributed. Law is the handsome guy whom you can really be envy of and Matt Damon is the less handsome guy who fits much better the role of a poor guy and who has complexes and some psychological issues. I believe Good Will Hunting is the proof that Matt Damon is the guy for this specific role and come to think about it no other actor of his generation could have done it better but Dicaprio probably equally and older guys as DeNiro and Liam Neeson.,The Talented Mr. Ripley

He uses this ability to insert himself into the lives of some rich and beautiful people. 
Matt Damon plays the po boy, and Jude Law the rich one. Some have criticized Damon's performance, but I think it was great. His quiet self consciousness was realistic, and just a little bit creepy, very believable..
 The rest of the actors were also perfectly cast, even Paltrow, the weakest of the crew. 
 Harvey Weinstein nailed it when he cast Gwyneth Paltrow as ""Marge""the amenable love interest of Law. Her acting abilities , or lack there of, become irrelevant as she plays the rich girl too cool for school( ""I hated that Park Avenue crowd"") , she runs off to Paris to write some self important novel that won't sell but doesn't need to, Daddy is rich. i know, quite the stretch....

No one was more astute about 1950s America than novelist Patricia Highsmith, not even Richard Yates (""Revolutionary Road"") or Rod Serling (""Patterns""). She discerned the pathway to success: first conformity, then flattery,and ultimately imitation. Anthony Minghella's (""The English Patient"") premature death is felt vividly here. The writing, casting, scoring, staging and establishment of atmosphere and mood are perfect. A kissing cousin to another masterpiece, ""The Third Man,"" albeit with a different conclusion, it's easily the best picture of 1999, IMO.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
145,Panterken,My Favorite Movie Of All Time: everything fits together just right.,10,18 October 2007,"It's too bad Patricia Highsmith will never be able to see Minghella's masterful adaptation of her novel. The Talented Mr. Ripley is easily Minghella's best film (yes, it's better than The English Patient) but sadly, has been under-appreciated for a long time. I hope the film will go into film history as a one of a kind psychological thriller, that's so haunting that it leaves a deep impression on all who watch it with an open mind. Besides the great screenplay, which I actually like better than the story in the novel, the film offers a great acting ensemble. You can see the actors lifting each other's performance, they really try to exceed each other. Although not every performance is Oscar-worthy, there isn't one member of the cast who delivers a mediocre one. I was especially surprised by Kate Blanchett's performance, who I honestly never considered to be a good actress even though the critics claim otherwise. She does however deliver a great performance in TTMR, she's more than excellent. The supporting cast does a great job as well: Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Marge Sherwood (though a little miscast) and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is unbelievably annoying as Freddie ( which is a good thing). Jack Davenport delivers a solid serene performance as Peter-Smith Kingsley. He convinces his audience, which is the most important thing. The role doesn't offer a whole lot to work with but he does a good job. Now, as good as the supporting cast was, none of them can hold a candle against the two male leads: Matt Damon simply becomes Tom Ripley and Jude Law is incredible in the role that seems to be made for him ( or is that merely Mr. Law's achievement that makes us perceive it like that?). Though Jude Law was the only actor who was nominated for an Academy Award, I feel Matt Damon really was the one who deserved the Oscar. It's still his best role to date and I don't think he'll ever be able to top it. His performance, subtle when needed and intense when needed, is really memorable. It's hard to describe just why I was so impressed with him.Good casting and acting alone doesn't make a masterpiece. Everything has to fit together perfectly. I'm happy to say that it actually does. The score is still my favorite to date. Even though I'm not a big jazz fan, I love it to death. The Academy Award nomination is 100% justified (of course Jared should have gotten it but I'm already glad he's at least been nominated). Especially the opening song is hauntingly beautiful. The locations chosen are gorgeous and go together great with the music. Minghella's shows us the Italy of our dreams, the picturesque village that wins everyone's heart, the Rome that speaks to our imagination...What really adds something to the movie is the perfect ending. I can't bear to imagine it would end any other way...it fits just right. Tragic, haunting, deeply shocking, deliciously evil,...",The Talented Mr. Ripley
146,Arkaan,"Superb, well crafted and acted (Spoilers)",9,8 January 2000,"I was surprised that people didn't like this film, but some of the arguments used need some clarification.  Someone said that the situation would unravel, like everyone knew it would.  Of course it would.  For their to be tension, the situation has to unravel.  If there was no tension, it wouldn't be a thriller.   You don't hate really any of these characters, except Freddy (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), but that is his character.  His role is rather small, so it really doesn't affect your liking of the film. The only real flaw of the film is it's overlength.  It is, as some have said, too long by about twenty minutes.  But that is it's only flaw.  Some people were bothered by the homosexual subtext.  All I can say is that it is personal taste, and the film would be completely different without it.Matt Damon gives an astonishingly good performance.  It is a tricky role, but he nails it by underplaying Thomas Ripley.  Damon is subtle, and projects his character by playing him quietly, not loudly.  Which is the complete opposite of Jude Law's scenery chewing role as Dickie Greenleaf. He is absolutley brilliant in the role.  What emerges when these two are on the screen is a mesmerizing tango of deceit.Gwyneth Paltrow is not that great.  She has a role that could have been played as anyone.  Same with Cate Blanchett, but she is good.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character is so obnoxious, and his performance in Happiness is so brilliant, that it just doesn't work.The ending is absolutely chilling.  It is not a happy ending, but one that is thought-provoking.  The script is very well written, and the cinematography is lush, but Anthony Minghella's direction really does use both to make a compelling film.

147,pekinman,The Superfluous Man,9,14 December 2006,"Anthony Minghella's adaptation of 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' possesses more depth and poses more questions than first viewings would indicate. At first viewing I was baffled by what motivated these people aside from simple selfishness on the part of the rich kids and class envy on the part of Tom Ripley. Since that first time I have thought about the various clues scattered along the way that Minghella throws out to help us along.The most important scene in this film, I think, is when Tom (Matt Damon) and Meredith (Cate Blanchett) attend the opera in Rome. On stage is the duel scene from Tchaikovsky's 'Eugene Onegin'. Lenski, Onegin's closest friend, has offended Onegin who has challenged him to a duel. Lenski, the simple musician, sings the last bit of his aria and then the two men do their paces and Onegin shoots Lenski dead. The key to Tom Ripley's enigmatic character and motivations in relation to the opera is; in the 19th century literature, in this case Pushkin, Onegin represented a type of man that was becoming extinct for various reasons, mostly cultural as a result of political disasters, the usual story. Onegin is what the Russians called a ""lishny chelovek"" or ""superfluous man."" A man with sensitivity and intelligence but doomed to have these qualities corrupted for want of a proper outlet in the society of his time. That is Tom Ripley.The interesting thing is, Tom Ripley is also Lenski, the simple musician, the lover, the sentimentalist. So, the operatic scene in this film symbolizes the self-immolation of Tom Ripley in the form of Eugene Onegin, the superfluous man, killing Lenski, the simple and gifted musician. This suicide explains a lot in the context of what ultimately happens in this film. It explains why Ripley does what he does on a fundamental level.Ripley has been left with no place to stand by the society of the plutocracy whose children, represented by Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), Marge, his fiancé (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Meredith the society girl from New York (Blanchett). All action stems from this fundamental twist in Ripley's psyche. The first time I saw this movie I was flummoxed, but now, if I am right about the scene at the opera house, I think I understand what makes these characters tick, which makes the film all that more interesting.There is some wonderful acting here too. Jude Law got all of the attention at the time of the release, and he is very good, but it is Matt Damon's astonishing performance as the geeky, pathetic Ripley that boggles the mind. Cate Blanchett turns what could have been a nothing, stereotyped part into a tour-de-force of subtle comedy and pathos, reminding me more than once of ""Little"" Edie Beale (Grey Gardens), the poor little rich girl with a heart of gold who can't find love because of the limitations placed upon her by the society in which she grew up. An intelligent young woman raised to be an empty-headed breeder. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderfully repulsive as Dickie's old chum from Princeton, with his beady-eyed, nastiness towards the ""leech"" Ripley. Gwyneth Paltrow is very good as the author who loves Dickie and is the only one who cottons on to what has happened to him but no one believes her.There is also sly satire at work here as well. Jude Law's character ""Dickie"" is a great fan of Charlie Bird.... ""Dickie Bird"" a Gilbert and Sullivan reference betokening the empty-headed fool dancing towards his doom to the tootling of some vapid jingle, ""Poor little Dickie Bird....tit-willow tit-willow"" etc. Dickie is out of his depth when he encounters the deeply twisted Tom Ripley who has set out to destroy his own identity, annihilate his personality and will not hesitate to eliminate all who would stand in his way. In the end he takes his revenge before meeting his own doom by killing love.This is a tragic film, beautifully done on all counts and though it seems to drag at times in the first half and has a deux ex machina ending to solve the complicated dilemma of closing the trap around Ripley, it is a first rate suspenser. Minghella does not have the Hitchcock touch but he's brought his own brand of haunting creepiness into this very fine film.Technical aspects are outstanding, The music by Gabriel Yared is beautiful and the script one of the better ones I've encountered in a long time.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
148,AlabamaWorley1971,Outstanding!,9,14 April 2000,"Obviously, it's beautifully photographed, but Matt Damon was the big surprise. He really impressed the hell out of me.

149,Don-102,The Talented Mr. Damon is Great in this Tense Psychological Thriller.,8,22 January 2000,"There are a lot of reasons to see THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY. It is not your typical, run of the mill Hollywood thriller.  In fact, it is refreshingly chilling and Matt Damon turns in what is by far his best acting job to date. He is able to shed the ""Will Hunting"" image here with a juicy role.  It is a personality twisting story unlike, say, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE,  which was highly conventional and more of a slasher picture.  I would equate it more with Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA.  The audience is never totally clear as to why ""Tom Ripley"" wants to consume another personality which is all the more mysterious.Anthony Minghella, director of ENGLISH PATIENT, sets the stage in late 1950's Italy, an exotic locale which adds to the suspense.  As the film progresses and it becomes more apparent there is something deeply wrong with Damon, you almost begin to root for him to get away with his malicious acts. He is so effective as the quietly psychotic Ripley because his actions do not seem planned.  He just kind of takes what is not his without reason. 
The beauty of Rome, Venice, and Gwyneth Paltrow tends to hide the inner turmoil going on with Damon's character and Jude Law is oblivious to it most of the time.  The madness builds slowly and Law, as the target of Damon's consuming desire, realizes it too late.  Law has the looks and mannerisms of a 50's matinee idol which fits perfectly within the context of the film. 
Some people have said THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is like a Hitchcock film for the 90's.  I would have to agree. Damon's ability to portray a fully realized, human leach is amazing at times and the fact that I actually had some sympathy for him proves it.  There are scenes of utter shock and dismay, but it is the drowning build to the inevitable murder and mayhem that grabs you.  RATING: ***1/2",The Talented Mr. Ripley
150,jackjack-2,A Movie With Great Potential That Fails,5,4 March 2001,"This movie develops very well until half way at a crucial point in the story, it takes a wrong turn. The author is so obsessed with making a point, that the story loses all realism and becomes a fairy tale mystery lacking any logic. The acting was not all that great either. Matt Damon sucked in a miscast role. Glynth Paltrow was also miscast in that she did not fit the role. One thing that made the movie interesting was the photography which was excellent but the movie was much too long. Had the author developed the plot more realistically, it would have been a real zinger. The story had all the right ingredients but the cook spoiled it and it was overcooked.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
151,littlemartinarocena,Dark And Gorgeous,9,10 October 2007,"Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley gets a deluxe reincarnation here, merit of the talented Mr. Minghella. A sensational script adaptation, stunning Italian locations and an extraordinary supporting cast. Tom Ripley saw the light before, most memorably with the face of Alain Delon in another beautiful outing by the underrated Rene Clement. This time, the winning feature is the superbly tailored script that gets inside the heads of the characters giving us a full panoramic view of their privileges as well as their desolation. Tom Ripley, the amoral, becomes the tortured immoral here. Anthony Minghella gives him a conscience, a self-awareness giving the tale an extra chilling touch. Matt Damon's natural dullness works wonders here. This may be his best performance to date. But it is the supporting cast that makes ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fly so high. Jude Law as the spoiled, vain and ultimately cruel Dickie Greenlef is truly remarkable. His worthlessness, crystal clear for everyone to see, becomes irrelevant due to the astonishing charisma and oodles of sexiness that Jude Law exudes. That, in itself, makes Gwynneth Paltrow's character totally believable. She's an intelligent woman who must know Dickie for what he is but she puts that aside and we don't question it. Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie is a fully fleshed out character who's on the screen for a few minutes but leaves and indelible impression. Great fun to witness his two faces. Creepy and wonderful. But it is Cate Blanchett, in a creation worthy of W Somerset Maughan that becomes the icing on this scrumptious cake. I would love to see a film where her Meredith is the central character. This ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" cemented my film relationship with Anthony Minghella. I wait for his films with childish anticipation.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

A confusing, inconsistent mess.Anthony Minghella, best known for ""The English Patient"", tries his hand at making a Hitchcock-style thriller.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have the master's knack for pacing and characterization, nor his instinct for when to leave something out.  We are never quite sure of Ripley's true motives, and the Cate Blanchett character is simply superfluous.All there really is that is worth taking notice of is the 1950's jazz and cars.

154,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 84,8,6 March 2016,"We all know Matt Damon can act. But if someone were to disagree, you'd have to show them this film. His, along with every single performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley, is top notch. Everything he does is so subtle, yet so calculated, that you believe it all. Or you're not sure what to believe. You see the brood amidst the confidence. Here, he plays Tom Ripley, a brilliant sociopath who uses his deception skills to fake his wealth. But the thing is, we the audience see every move he makes. It's the other characters who are being tricked.In fact, Damon is so convincing that it's not until after the film is over when you realize there's nothing to like about his character at all.Beautifully shot with authentic set design, The Talented Mr. Ripley leads us in the direction of a truly Hitchcockian feature in every way--the experimentation of narrative, the pseudo- protagonist, and even the signature blonde.You have to applaud this film for keeping the audience on their toes. The story is constantly changing. Resetting its goals. Much like when our brains shift a bit when Janet Leigh dies half way through Psycho. We feel like it should end there. Wouldn't most movies?Leaving us sitting up in our chairs, it becomes reminiscent of The Master of Suspense, himself. But then, all of a sudden, things change, and it no longer seems that way at all. You realize it keeps avoiding some sort of conclusion. Dancing around it, actually. And usually when films continue on like this, you expect a redeeming ending. However, without giving anything away, we don't get one.When the movie is constantly showing us its hand, we are left wondering why. Maybe something bigger and better is around the corner. Maybe they're saving the real twist for the very end. The story has so many chances to give us something grand, but they all fall by the wayside.Director, Anthony Minghella, definitely has the creepy and suspenseful tone down. And he pulls the best performances from his actors. He does a very good job, given the source material. But his the biggest impression he's left here may be how he gets us to look at Damon in a much different way.Twizard Rating: 84",The Talented Mr. Ripley
155,jamericanbeauty,The Ugliest Pretty People. Gorgeous Backdrop. Perfect Score Compensates for Bloated Runtime..,9,10 January 2021,"Matt Damon delivers a masterpiece performance as Tom Ripley, a brilliant, psychotic master of disguise, who out-schemes and murders pretentious and obnoxious college alumni in Italy. I felt nothing when he killed them and I doubt anyone will miss them. I did feel sympathy for Mr. Ripley because while Damon played him with a necessary creepiness, he was mostly vulnerable and charismatic. I only felt sympathy for Mr. Ripley's handsome ship mate Peter at the end. He was the only good, genuinely nice person in the whole movie. The main flaw the movie has is Mr. Ripley not killing Dickie's (Jude Law) girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). She's a writer, who never writes anything, and her obsession with Dickie's initial whereabouts and later facts surrounding his death drove me crazy. Dickie was a selfish, spoiled, unambitious, scattered, philandering, pathological liar and man-child. Honey, move on! Even his own Dad seemed relieved the Dickie saga was behind him.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
156,alexdeleonfilm,a superior french original dressed up in Hollywood glitz,7,2 July 2017,"Viewed at the Berlin Film Festival, 2000 Anthony Minghella's thriller ""The Talented Mister Ripley"" has been a big commercial success as a multi-star vehicle but by no means a critical success – far inferior to it's 1959 French predecessor ""Purple Noon"" (Plein Soleil) of which it is a direct remake dressed up in Hollywood glitz. The story centers on a wily loser from New York (Matt Damon) who befriends a wealthy American ex-pat in Italy (ajude Law) then murders him and steals his identity. This film was probably selected because it is the director's follow-up to the much heralded ""English Patient"" of 1996. While Matt Damon was oddly appealing as the psychotic antihero of the title, his interpretation of the role doesn't hold a candle to Alain Delon's definitively sinister Ripley in the René Clément version. Nor can Jude Law's over-the-top ""Dickie Greenleaf""  begin to compare with Maurice Ronet's super-cool reading of the same part in '59. Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow fill out the feminine side of the cast. Philip Seymour Hoffman nearly steals the show in a small role as the creepy guy who is on to Damon's deadly stealing of another person's identity. Not bad as far as remakes go ""The Talented Mister Ripley"" is a flashy piece of contemporary entertainment but is far from rating as a serious festival contender.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
157,pri_e,The Disappointing Mr Ripley,5,26 February 2000,"This movie started of as mysterious and intriguing, Matt Damon played Mr Ripley really well. Jude Law was cool as Dickie Greenleaf, Gwyneth Paltrow was good as her character Marge but wouldn't deserve an oscar nomination for as she was ""tipped"" for but I thought Cate Blanchett played Meredith pretty good as well. The story was good in the beginning but it began to get slow as the investigation went on, and they'd have to be pretty s**t investigators if they couldn't figure out what was obviously in front of them. I began to suspect Tom Ripley was gay rather than having a brotherly love for Dickie and then for Kingsley. It just became inconsistent and the ending, what so he got sick of being nobody and now wants to be Kingsley...I think the movie was overrated but cleverly crafted in the first half",The Talented Mr. Ripley
158,smashattack,"The ""Dull"" Mr. Ripley",1,21 January 2002,"Spoilers.So far I've learned more about the plot of this movie by searching it out on IMDb.com than I did when watching it.This movie has no texture to it.  The characters are bland and you hardly get to know them.  Ripley is assigned to go get some guy's son, and when he gets there, he ends up liking him and staying rather than taking him back.They live.  He meets his friends.  They just keep living and living, without a plot to back up anything interesting until Ripley kills the son, whose name is Dick.  Why he killed him, we will never know.  They were fighting over something.So then he goes on a killing spree to cover up his crime, but Dick's wife knows he did it.  The movie's GOOD plot should kick in right about now, but it doesn't.  The ending comes and Ripley kills his best friend to conceal the first, second, third, however many murders there were.This seems to be the only movie that really matches Fight Club, which were both movies dull, plain, and boring enough to be described as ""Nothing happens"".  Sure, stuff happens, but in this movie it's only the normal life of some guy in Europe until more than halfway through the movie.I don't understand why something so repetitive and unexcusably lame could be so popular.

161,heckles,For God's sake people - stop being thrown by the gay angle!,9,21 August 2003,"I can't get over how many sour reviews of this movie register disgust that the main character is gay. Get over it. Tom Ripley's gayness is not what makes this film so interesting - what makes it so is the way Ripley goes from a innocent deceiver to a fraud artist; then to hot blooded killer of a unlikable person to a cold blooded killer of a likable one. It's something that could have been written about a heterosexual (and please, don't bore me with 'well why didn't the author write it that way?') That was the author's choice. Either way, I found Tom to be one fascinating bastard. On top of which, I saw this movie in a Montreal theatre in January with ice covering the sidewalks outside. Spending two visual hours in sunny Italy added to the enjoyment.I found in Tom a similarity with the title character in ""Paul's Case,"" a short story about a young man, tired of grungy working class surroundings in 1900 Pittsburgh, steals a sum of money from his employer, lives about a week in a top NY hotel, and then commits suicide when the money is exhausted. Here, in contrast, the main character extends his run of luck through psychopathic homicideOne might notice at the end Tom has a choice in sympathetic people to kill to maintain his deception - Meredith, who would be missed by her friends, or Peter, who came on board alone and unseen. It isn't hard to guess who is chosen.I would dearly love to see two or three sequels to this film - provided, of course, that Tom got his just deserts in the final reel.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
162,irishm,I've never read the novel,6,6 September 2016,"Having said that, I've read a lot of the other reviews, and many seem to feel the characterization of Ripley in the book is superior to the film version. It sounds like the novel's Ripley was a more proactive kind of a guy: rather than waiting for things to happen to him, he went out and MADE them happen. That approach would seem to make more sense in this kind of drama. The Ripley of the film was almost inert. The only real effort he put into the story line was to learn something about jazz. Opportunistic in only the most passive of ways, he allowed events to wash over him like ocean waves and then only sprang into action when it was absolutely necessary to direct the events himself. This type of character rarely reaches significant levels of success in his chosen field, whether it's brain surgery or identity theft.I'll admit that I had my doubts about the plot from the start, right from the time Ripley ""connected"" with Greenleaf Senior over the Princeton jacket. I have a little experience with the ""old boy"" system and I find it almost impossible to believe that Ripley was able to convincingly present that he was ever at Princeton because I know the kinds of questions that always get asked when an alma mater is being discussed among fresh acquaintances.I'm one who didn't mind the length of the film, at least; it seemed to want to have a lot to say and I was fine with how long it took to try and tell it. I don't have much of an opinion on Matt Damon one way or the other, but he was nothing special here. Jude Law and Philip Seymour Hoffman turned in the best performances by far. The location shooting was beautiful.All in all, there was enough here to make me curious about reading the original novel someday, but the film itself is only average.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Gwyneth Paltrow continues to live up to her status as one of the most overrated actors in the history of cinema, and definitely one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Her best piece of acting was her Oscar acceptance speech, although I later found out that she was actually treating her award, and not surprisingly herself seriously.
Back to the flick. Matt Damon is awful, Jude Law and Cate Blanchett do all they can to save the movie, but it was a battle they could never win. So boring, long, and without a trace of originality. I walked out of the cinema feeling very shaken and ill in the stomach.Gwyneth, Please Stop.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
164,Criticalstaff,A mesmerizing story,8,29 June 2021,"I love this movie a lot. It has no major flaws, it is almost perfect technically, stylistically and it is unique and original. Few movies are as gorgeous as this one. The story might be of a dark psycho-thriller with a heavy dose of social commentary, whatever, it is such a pleasure to watch these beautiful people evolve in such a glamourous setting as is fifties Italy for a couple of hours. The power of the visual storytelling and the overall luxury of the scenes make this movie by themselves. You almost don't need a plot, a story or characters. Fortunately, this movie still delivers all that, which makes it, in my humble opinion, somewhat of an underrated classic.The film is basically social commentary on the rich and wealthy, underneath an elaborate character study. At least that is my interpretation. The movie weaves enough texture into film that you can read things differently, and still be correct. There is obviously the themes of homosexuality and one's identity, the duality of man... The film asks the question about who we are and who we appear to be. Ripley, and Dickie to a certain extent, have one identity on the surface and one that is hidden or more intimate. And Ripley is able to see that, or at least his guess is correct. That is the true connection between them; they are both social chameleons. That is why the boat scene is so riveting, because all the movie's themes come crashing against each other.The first half is certainly the most gorgeous, and similarly to Ripley, you just want to stay there indefinitely. You don't want the summer to end, you don't want the vacation to end. The movie pits fantasy against reality throughout. The whole first act might feel like an effortless dream. The second part is brutally real. Ripley might think that he became Dickie, that he hustled his way into that lifestyle, but it feels off. Ripley's flat is nice and richly decorated, but it is rather hollow and pedestrian. That is why when Freddie comes to visit and provokes him it's so delightful. He sees through Ripley effortlessly. Freddie is the worst, obnouxious and disgusting but he so magnificent at it.On the one hand, you can feel Ripley's inadequacies and low self-esteem. On the other you gasp at his predatory beautiful mind.I feel obliged to add that while I rated this film higher than the 1960 French version, I believe that one is the better adaptation. Interestingly both films have a similar plot, but they tell vastly different stories. I also found it cool that this movie acknowledges and pays homage to the earlier film, it's a nice touch. Nevertheless, this film being more balanced and a bit more refined for a mainstream audience is the better movie overall. Purple Noon on the other hand feels like a better Ripley movie.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
165,Signet,Superb Philip Seymour Hoffman,10,4 January 2001,"Among the many compelling reasons to see this wonderful film is the incisively drawn and perfectly acted performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman. His bloated upper-class tiger is one of the most scarifying figures in the whole film, with his narrow eyes seeing more than they should see, his unconcealed snobbery and cruelty ever-vigilant for a victim.  This was an award-worthy performance and adds to this amazing character actor's string of astonishing credits and, for me, was the most elegant piece of acting in the movie, right down to Hoffman's gravelly, drawling voice and his display of the eating habits of the unmitigated sensualist.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Having read the book and having seen Plein Soleil, the French version I was not in need of being convinced the Ripley was or was not gay. The extra complication that comes and goes in the last few minutes while underscoring that a villains work is never done, did nothing to add to the movie.Matt Damon is terrific and Gwyenth Paltrow superb but the amazing performances were Jude Law and whoever did Freddie. I hated the Freddie character beforehand for all the right reasons and this Freddie was every rotten sniveling spoiled rotten American child thing that he could be-he surely deserved what he got.Some folks have commented on the length of the movie, I did not notice it at all until it was over. (and I decided that they could have cut 10 minutes, but that was only long in retrospect.)All in all a very satisfying movie.

Tom Ripley just hangs out with Dickie Greenleaf and Marge for 2/3 of the movie and then he kills Dickie and his pal and gets away with it. Then the movie just takes a whole different turn. Turns out that its the end of the movie. Thats it, you don't see what happens to Marge or Tom Ripley. It just ends. Its just a bunch of boring stuff that happens and to make things worse it was almost 3 hours long but it felt like it was 8 hours long. Give me a break. Two weak movies from Damon in a row.

168,Jimmy-128,One of the more disturbing films I've seen in a while.,8,29 September 2000,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" requires a certain amount of attention, maturity, and investment, but the eventual payoff is by far one of the more satisfying film experiences you're likely to get.  Boasting magnificent performances from all involved and some truly breathtaking cinematography, it's well worth the time and money spent on it.Matt Damon is one of the most underrated actors of our time, and, if he were a woman, he would have almost as many Oscar nominations to his credit as Meryl Streep.  Since the men's field is more crowded, he didn't get a nod for ""Ripley"", but it's hard to see why not.  His performance of the working-class nobody who accidentally falls in with the idle rich is a finely nuanced piece of work, and he handles Tom's inevitable downfall like a pro with twice his experience.  The final sequence ranks up there with ""Breaker Morant"" as one of the most powerful I've ever seen on film.Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful as Marge; she almost makes me yearn for the era of silent movies, back when ""we had FACES."" (sorry, Norma)  A truly gifted actress with a tremendous breadth of emotion, Paltrow is most effective when she finally figures out what's happened.  The horror in her eyes is chilling to watch.Jude Law is quite good as the spoiled, irresponsible Dickie, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is equally good as the odious Freddie.Finally, the camera does a fabulous job of portraying the sheer luscious beauty that is Italy.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

This just shows that Oscar sometimes nominates films based on who is in them or who wrote or directed them. I can't see who this film was nominted for Best Pic any other way, because it certainly didn't deserve it! Matt Damon gave a very dull portrayal that lacked depth and intensity for most of the film. Jude Law, however, was absolutley fantastic and totally deserved his Oscar nomination. The movie was very predictable and boring, and I am glad that I rented it so I could fast-forward through nothing, looking for something exciting or watchable that never materialized.

173,marcosaguado,The Purple Noon of Anthony Minghella,8,2 May 2005,"As a huge fan of Rene Clement's ""Purple Noon"" I came to Minghella's version of Patricia Highsmith's story with suspicion and an irrational predisposition to dismiss it. Well, I was wrong. The talented Mr. Minghella perpetrated a magic trick. The film stands on its own as an entertaining, creepy, thoughtful, beautiful to look at piece of film-making. Jude Law throw us for six, we're not suppose to feel attracted to the selfish Dickie Greenleaf, but we do. His scrumptious performance is alluring, seductive. He is a scene stealer of major proportions. In the original, Maurice Ronnet's oily Dickie Greenleaf was a perfect lamb to the slaughter. We don't mourn his death and want the murderous Ripley, as played by Alain Delon, to get away with it. Here, when Jude Law is on the screen that's what we're looking at. We're prepared to forgive him anything and everything. I did believed in Gwyneth Paltrow's qualm, totally. In the original, Marie Laforet played it as a tenuous, unclear little excuse. Gwyneth Paltrow gives us a multi dimensional character and we go through her torment every step of the way. That, presumably, is merit in great part of Minghella's superb screenplay. Other joys are Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. On the minus side Matt Damon couldn't make me forget Alain Delon. His Ripley is a better written character than Delon's and his performance is top notch, but Delon was breathtaking on the screen. I think than Anthony Minghella was more interested in the inner workings of Ripley's mind that in the pyrotechnics of a implausible plot. Good. The semi confession of Matt Damon about a basement full of secret truths tells us about his pain about his fear. Delon's Ripley is amoral to the hilt. The murder of Dickie in the original is terrifying. It takes forever. As well as the getting rid of Freddy's body. Minghella never show us how Ripley managed to bring a dead body down the stairs. Clement spends a great deal of time with it. Making it enormously suspenseful. But, as I mentioned before we did care about Delon and, maybe, Minghella new that whether Damon got caught or not wasn't that important. All in all I liked the film very much and the biggest lesson from a film fanatic's point of view is: you don't kill your Jude Law half way through a film unless you leave us in the hands of someone who will make us forget him. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, remember that?",The Talented Mr. Ripley
174,kaaber-2,The Talented Mr Minghella,10,16 March 2008,"The film is pure delight from beginning to end, with everyone putting in their very best; Damon, Paltrow, Seymor Hoffmann, Law, Blanchett. However, the laurels must land chiefly on Minghella's head, for he appears to be responsible for transforming Patricia Highsmith's old novel into quite a different story about the making of a killer. The French film version with Alain Delon (Au plein soleil) was slow-moving, largely uninteresting and looked more like an over-long Roald Dahl Tale of the Unexpected, but Minghella has chosen to explain Tom Ripley and create much more sympathy for him than Highsmith could muster. And he has done so thoroughly by boosting the homosexual love angle that is more subdued in the novel and next to non-existing in the French film. By making it clear from the outset that Ripley falls in love with Dickie Greenleaf, a love that is unrequited but still partly encouraged by Dickie, everything falls into place up to the first murder, and the subsequent killings are acts of desperate self-preservation.But even more interesting is it that if we peruse the list of 20 characteristics of a psychotic compiled by Robert Hare, the leading expert on psychotic behavior, we may be surprised to find that the psycho in Minghella's film is not Tom Ripley at all, but Dickie Greenleaf.Dickie possesses superficial charm, he is self-centered to a fault, has an excessive need for stimulation and is prone to boredom, he is manipulative (when he makes love to Marge on the boat in order to avoid a row), and shows little remorse, even when Silvana, his Italian fling, commits suicide. He is certainly living off others (his father) and shows an admirable lack of self-control, and his chief characteristic may very well be his promiscuity. Late in the story we hear that he has been sent out of the US because he viciously assaulted and maimed another young man, he blames others for his problems, he has a lack of realistic long-term goals (as Tom points out, first he wants to be the best sax-player in the world, then it's drums) and he is impulsive.If we add up all his psychotic characteristics, Dickie scores 16 out of twenty points, whereas Minghella's Ripley only has four or five, and even these appear to be somewhat mitigated by circumstance; he lies and manipulates out of necessity, and his lack of self-control occurs only when pushed to the limit.The result is a subtle and exciting psychological thriller which surpasses the novel (IMO) and surpasses the old French film by far.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
175,punctate,good thriller,10,4 January 2000,"You won't see a more intelligent thriller this year, a stylish masterpiece. Tom Ripley is hired to bring back Dickie and his wife back to New York from Italy. Tom Ripley becomes enchanted with the life of Dickie; when Dickie threatens to send Tom away, Tom acts out violently. Tom attempts to be Dickie and himself at the same time leading to some problems. Tom's somewhat homosexual actions could leave the girl fans of Matt Damon confused. Matt Damon does a excellent job of playing the disturbing character Tom Ripley.

I did not read Highsmith's novels so I don't know how faithful this film is to the character. I get the feeling that the director wanted to throw everything but the kitchen sink into this movie to force a maximum creepfest. The problem is, this film could have ended six or seven times before it did. The film's conclusion, far from leaving us sated, left us numb in disbelief. It just wasn't the jolt that the filmmakers probably desired.Still, it is a well made film with good performances, gorgeous scenery, high production values, etc. A marginal thumbs up...",The Talented Mr. Ripley

182,Dark Eye,Great film with great characters,10,14 September 2000,"This film was the biggest surprise of the year for me.  I absolutely loved the film.  Not too many films these days tries to focus on what makes a person tick, and digs into the person's dark underbelly.  As a thriller, it is psychologically intelligent.The film gives the audiences the thrill to see how Mr. Ripley escape situations that he does not want to be in.  As the result he descends deeper and deeper into darkness that would eventually engulf him.  The real treat is how Anthony Minghella looks into the main protagonist and create tension within and around him real well.  Jude Law is absolutely convincing, and Cate Blanchet has never been so charming and sweet.Movies involving unstable characters are often fun to watch, like Taxi Driver, because it's like watching a walking time bomb hidden underneath a complex mask.  Needless to say I had great fun watching Talented Mr. Ripley, and I recommend this movie to everyone out there.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
183,Dark Eye,Some people just don't get it,10,25 August 2002,"This is a brilliant movie, and I personally don't understand why some reviewers here loathed it so much. The film has great acting, deliciously dark & narcisistic characters, and a plot that at times reminded me of Hitchcock. It is a story of a great talent born out of self-hate.As for the casts, they did a great job. Jude Law is great being an obnoxious rich boy. Cate Blanchett, while she did not have much onscreen time, she is as lovely as ever. I've always viewed Matt Damon as the more talented actor than his other ""creative"" counterpart, Ben Affleck. In the beginning of the story, Mr. Ripley is a social mess, always nervous around people, and hates himself. However at the end of the film, he is the epitome of moral grayness, a dangerous mix of being a sociopath and conflicting emotions. He becomes both repulsive and pathetically sad at the same time. Hoooboy, not good.As for people hating this movie, I often hear complaints regarding the character Mr Ripley; about how bad, wacko, and crazy he is and that the movie is terrible because of him. Well I always say to these people: what is wrong with you?? It is like having an unstable element - much like the excitement of waiting for a deadly fire underneath the shimmering surface to explode - that makes Talented Mr Ripley worth watching. Another word, this movie is nothing less than a A+ grade psychological thriller. Did those who criticized this movie saw their own insecurities within Mr Ripley and in turn becomes uncomfortable to fully appreciate its finer points? Perhaps, I don't know for sure.I loved The English Patient with its melachonly, ambient middle-eastern atmosphere, and now Anthony Minghella has taken us inside one person's dark & disturbing mind and his pathetic effort to cover his own identity ... at all costs. Highly recommended for the intelligent viewers.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The theme hasn't been original since ""Fatal Attraction, 1987"" and ""Hand That Rocks the Cradle, 1992"", both of which are much better than this.  Tom Ripley (Matt Damon, miscast badly) has a knack for imitating people.  He pretends to be the friend of a rich Ivy League student, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), when he meets his father, Herbert (James Rebhorn).  His father sends the supposed friend of his son to retrieve him from Italy and his girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow).  No, that doesn't make sense.  And it doesn't make sense when you watch it either.  Stupid story, no logic behind it at all.  Good acting by everyone except Damon.  Jude Law is fantastic. Highly overrated movie.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
185,stirred_mind,Very Under-rated.,8,2 June 2000,"I have seen reviews of this film and people give it 5/10 and 3/10. It is just because they couldn't understand the film. I, myself found it intriguing and my eyes were glued the the screen. The story is amazing, the direction is fabulous and the acting is excellent. The story kept my ass glued to my seat the whole time, with no intention of getting up.In short, The Talented Mr. Ripley is the most intelligent thriller of 1999.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
186,EThompsonUMD,A thriller worthy of Hitchcock comparisons.,8,6 February 2000,"Spoilers. The character-based depths of intrigue in The Talented Mr. Ripley unfold slowly, but unpredictably and satisfyingly. The film is reminiscent in some ways of Hitchcock's Suspicion but with a homosexual subtext that recalls Strangers on a Train (also based on a mystery novel by Patricia Highsmith)not to mention such quicker-paced, less ambitious, identity-switch thrillers as Single White Female and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.As Hitchcock often did (e.g. Psycho), Anthony Minghella asks us to share the point of view of - and to sympathize with - a profoundly flawed, perhaps psychotic, character. And Matt Damon's performance as Mr. Ripley is complex and appealing enough to pull it off. Jude Law's performance as Ripley's wealthy foil/alter-ego lights up the screen and Gwynth Paltrow has some surprising moments in the film's finale. Some viewers have criticized the film's ending, but, like its refusal to provide simplistic motives for Ripley's desire to be someone else, the ending too refuses to shed neatly illuminating light on the mysteries of his character. The door closes on the dark room of his psyche, leaving us to speculate on its contents. For instance, is it accidental that two of the three men he kills are named ""Dickie"" and ""Peter""?",The Talented Mr. Ripley
187,CaptRon-2,A different spin from Hollywood,8,8 January 2000,"A good movie with the help of an excellent script. Matt shows some real acting flair and Hollywood gives us a script that is something greatly different than what we are normally fed by the American Movie Machine. My only negative to this movie is that we see a relationship between two men but Hollywood plays it ""safe"" by not showing any physical contact between them. This movie takes a lot out of you to see the character develop but is well worth the wait to see the many depths of Mr. Ripley. The entire cast was strong and the scenery was beautiful.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
188,ToddTee,Matt Damon's best work,9,15 November 2001,"Everything about this movie struck me as being ""right on the mark"", most especially Matt Damon as a man who has at least lost his way.  To tell more is to tell too much, but I find much to like in this twisted tale set against the beauty of Italy.

I Loved this movie.Character development, a coherent plot and wonderful performances.Things you usually dont get in a Hollywood movie these days. I thought Matt Damon proved himself as an Actor and I did find myself rooting for him even though he was actually the bad guy.We have a villian here that you understand and you see why he is like this and though what he is doing is wrong, at least you see why he is like that unlike so many Black and Vilians in movies. Hats off to the director for not shying away from the Gay subtext of the story! I also thought Jude Law and the rest of the supporting players were Great and the scenery? Wonderful. In this day in age of Adam Sandler Movies, it was refreshing to see an intelligent movie. I hope this is nor forgotten around Oscar time",The Talented Mr. Ripley
190,movieman9,Surprisingly intense and enthralling thriller; RIPLEY is satisfying!,9,30 July 2000,"I sincerely hesitated before renting THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY this past weekend. I had heard rumors from others who were dissatisfied with this film, unhappy with their reaction to Anthony Minghella's follow-up to his majorly successful ""The English Patient."" Just the fact that Minghella directed it made me quiver. ""English Patient"" has to be one of my most hated films for which much praise was received. However, something compelled me to pick it up. Maybe Minghella deserved another chance in my books. This time, he was using marquee actors of a more popular nature, rather than artsy-type thespians like Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche. The moment I popped the DVD in and viewed this picture, I was hooked and enthralled. ""The Talented Mr. Riply"" uses just the right amount of artistry and goes thick on plot and method acting to create a thriller which the great Hitchcock would have been proud of.I must admit the previews made me take interest in this film before I considered looking at it. The plot seemd so fascinating, and it surely is. I'll only mention the minute details of it so as not to spoil anything for those who have not seen it, and also so I don't screw up some of the descriptions. Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a bland, ordinary individual who longs to become someone else other than the nobody who is himself. He gets that opportunity when a man named Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) offers him $1,000 to retrieve his son from Europe, whom he suspects is frittering his money and his life away. Ripley takes on the assignment, and surprisingly, as soon as he meets up with Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), he immediately tells him his intentions and quickly becomes his best buddy. His girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also very impressed with their new acquaintance. Little do they know that Tom Ripley's main ""talent"" is impersonating people around him, taking on their identities and making them his own. Dickie's will be his first one to capture.I mentioned that Sir Alfred would have been pleased to see this film if he were alive today, and while I was watching ""Ripley,"" I couldn't help but be amazed by the technical and narrative similarities to Hitch's archetypes, which today are endlessly duplicated. I found it riveting how the plot and the director focus in on the scheming of Ripley, allowing the audience to be swept up in his improvisation and daring manner of always running under the knife. I don't know if the DVD technology is a considerable enhancement here, but Minghella's direction also takes on a life of its own. The purposeful shading and camera angles take on almost a voyeuristic quality, as if we the viewer are objectively but holistically involved in Ripley's feats of derring-do. The cinematography is fancy, but not overly distracting. Its viewpoint is always set on the characters and how they relate with each other.The performances are carefully choreographed but consistently drawn to look natural and of-the-moment. Such aspects are especially important in the case of Matt Damon, who takes the character of Tom Ripley and subtly makes him look pathetic but endlessly interesting to watch. Jude Law plays such a three-dimensional character here that his might be the most difficult one to play among the key players. Dickie Greenleaf (the real one) must be outgoing and friendly but also cold and disheartening. We may be repelled by him, but his fate never seems warranted, even during his most tragic hour. Gwyneth is beautiful as always, but also finds the right note for a woman who is unrightfully left behind and deceived by both these leading men. Cate Blanchett also has a small and thankless role as an innocent European traveller who happens upon this happy throng, totally unaware of the deception and indecency that is going on. She was probably my favorite character of them all, a symbol that Hitchcock created many years before.When critics and film fans remarked that the end of 1999 saw some of the best films in a blue moon hit theaters, I am inclined to believe them. Along with other favorites of mine like ""The Green Mile"" and ""American Beauty,"" I would vote for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" as one of the best films of the year. It is smart, visually and narratively creative, and on a whole, a truly satisfying entertainment. For thinking viewers, it is a special treat. For casual moviegoers, I believe there is still much to behold in this film, even if you are not one who is used to letting movies soak into your system. Minghella takes his time unwinding this ingenious tale, but the unfolding of the plot and the eventual pay-off is a chilling and fulfilling movie experience. Rating: Four stars",The Talented Mr. Ripley
191,concrndone,Satan himself,10,18 July 2021,"Tom Ripley is a nobody. Literally. He does not know who he is. Thus he takes on the identities of others. Thus his adeptness at taking on the identities of others. He is an empty shell. A hollow vessel. A mimic that can replicate the object of his desire but cannot fully become it. There is no truth in him. He is A body-snatcher. A psychopath. Sociopath. Narcissist. Satanist.In this adventure, Satan nestles himself amongst the god-like oligarchs of the Eastern Establishment who, naturally, take to him like a cat to cream. He partakes in the Satanic pleasure of creating a whole false mythology for himself in the name of Tom Ripley: Princeton attendee and saviour of Dickie Greenleaf. As is typical of the psychology of Satan, the reverse is actually the case.The child-like lullaby music is wholly appropriate because Satan is basically a child. Behind that false visage lies a hedonistic, selfish, ego-centric toddler.I enjoyed this film. Matt Damon plays the role well. He is able to shift persona from affable to psychotic in quick succession and in a subtle,believable way. I can feel his loneliness. I can feel his pain: that yearning for an identity. Good film.The only worrying thing is that this film shows Satan getting away with his crimes, how what kind of message is that to spread around? Why, it is a Satanic message to be sure.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

I thought that first 2 thirds were uncomfortably bad and the last part actually better, albeit not that much. Yes, pacing was a problem and acting too! Matt Damon was woefully out of place and I had no idea what the point of this movie was. Mediocre would be a kind description for this bland waste of time. I guess they can't all be good!!",The Talented Mr. Ripley
193,Chris-332,A Very Interesting and Chilling Movie.,10,2 January 2000,"The Talented Mr.Ripley is simply a very good movie. It had everything a good movie has to offer. The story is extremely interesting. The way Anthony Minghella built up the great characters through his screenplay was excellent. The way the movie expresses how boring and tragic Tom Ripley's life is is amazing. The main story is about Mr. Ripley, who is mistaken for another person and paid $1000 (a lot of money back in the '50's) by a rich man to go to Italy and persuade the man's son, Dickie Greenleaf, to come back to the US. Ripley goes, only to fall in love with everything about Dickie's life, including Dickie himself. He stays there for a long time having the time of his life with Dickie, until another person gets into the picture, Freddie Miles, and Dickie loses his attention to Tom. Dickie gets bored with Tom, who gets more depressed the longer Freddie Miles stays with them. Then, on a lonely boating trip, Tom gets overpowered by rage and kills Dickie. He then, still in love with Dickie's lifestyle, takes Dickie's identity. Another marvelous thing about the movie is the amazing acting. Matt Damon is chilling as Tom Ripley. He is the bad guy for the last half of the movie (the brat Dickie is the antagonist in the first half), yet you still root for him to escape. Jude Law is fantastic as Dickie Greenleaf. Jude Law is an outstanding actor, and I'm so mad that he is so underrated. He really stands out in this movie, as he did the masterpiece movie ""Gattaca"". Gweneth Paltrow was great in it. Cate Blanchet was very good. All the characters in the movie were well done. The directing is also superb. I didn't see The English Patient by Anthony Minghella, but this was great. The directing was some of the best I've seen this year. The opening credits were awesome, too. This was a very intelligent and intruiging movie, despite its length. I enjoyed every minute of it. I definitely recommend this movie to fans of drama and suspense.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
194,patrick.hunter,Matt Damon walked right out of Highsmith's novel,10,8 December 2004,"For those who grouse about Matt Damon, I can only say read Patricia Highsmith's very entertaining psychological thriller. If you find the title character in this film callow and sexually confused, then I can only that's how he is in the book. This movie is really a more faithful adaptation than the earlier version PURPLE NOON, directed by Rene Clement. Many people prefer that French film, which is (unlike many French thrillers compared to Hollywood ones) a more traditional crime movie, even containing a more compact, wrap-up-all-the-disturbing-aspects type of ending. It also starred an appealingly sexy and young Alain Delon as a more charismatic Tom Ripley. However, Highsmith's book clearly points out that character is not charismatic; he only wishes he were more charismatic. Unlike Delon's, Matt Damon's interpretation contains far more complexity. As an actor, he straddles two difficulties: 1) playing someone who's such a nondescript entity that he both envies and despises the idle American rich, 2)making the character intriguing enough for the audience not to lose interest in him, because it is his story and he does carry the film. ""Better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody"" is Tom Ripley's philosophy. It's a tragic world-view, and--weirdly--one that many of us can understand, if not empathize with. I wonder how many critics dismiss this movie because it unsettlingly provokes aspects of themselves they'd prefer to remain hidden?Yes, the movie makes changes, including Cate Blanchett's character, who is not even in the original, but it's faithful in terms of plot and, yes, character. It captures well the book's irony that Tom Ripley so aches to join this class of people, despite the fact that he's smarter and more alive than any of them. Perhaps the story is far-fetched, but it has more to say to all of us than what might first meet the eye.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

196,bicgus1,A Memorable Film,10,14 August 2015,"I saw this movie quite soon after it was made and kept record in my memory of it being quite fine. Now, about fifteen years later, I saw it again, and honestly, I am impressed for the fact that it was even much better than I remembered. Clearly, to me it is the very best of Minghella, and most surely one of my top ten ever (and I HAVE watched quite a number of films). The music is superb; so are the views of Italy. Also, by 2015, which is when I am writing this review you can delight yourself with a number of impressive actors, many of them in their very beginnings. Matt Damon is excellent. Jude Law is excellent. And so are Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Jack Davenport. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is OUTSTANDING: I've met people like the character he plays and I sware it is impossible to play this better. This film, is a hundred dollar seat worth movie, and the second half will just keep you tied to the seat no matter what. By the way it is a rather long flick, the kind you wish it were even longer. DO NOT MISS IT.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
197,hprill,Hugely overrated,4,9 September 2001,"Anthony Minghella may have read, but not understood Patricia Highsmith's Ripley novels before he made this film. Mr Ripley is definitely not the whining, homosexual schoolboy as which he comes across in this movie, and the pace of the film also feels completely wrong.Matt Damon feels somewhat out of place in this movie; he is good at playing a character from what seems to be an entirely different film. Gwyneth Paltrow, while nice to look at, is no more than a shadowy 1950s cardboard heroine without personality. I think she's not to blame for that, it's the script that puts her in this role.Excellent performance from Jude Law, whom I keep liking more and more with each new performance I see. Philip Seymour Hoffman, though cast in only a minor role, is also very good.How this unevenly paced misunderstanding of a great Patricia Highsmith novel could ever get a ""best film"" nomination is beyond me. The only reason to watch is Jude Law and to learn How Not To Make A Movie.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
198,Sam_Gray,It just doesn't end,2,29 February 2000,"My first complaint about The Talented Mr. Ripley is that it seems incredibly long. To me, this movie felt longer than either Magnolia or The Green Mile, both of which are a full 3/4 of an hour longer. But, the primary reason this movie is so bad is that it has a really poor choice of character focus. Someone like Tom Ripley, a figure whose past is shrouded in mystery - even for the audience, fits a secondary role much better than a leading one. In the entire film, the only thing we learn about Ripley, other than the fact that he's good at pretending to be other people, is the nature of his sexual orientation. In fact, because we know so little about him, I kept expecting some huge revelation, but there is none.                              Also, while Paltrow and Blanchett do a decent job in their roles, everyone else comes off as fake. Jude Law's performance, in particular, is extraordinarily overrated; he's been better elsewhere (such as in Gattaca). And whenever Damon's Ripley ""imitates"" another character, it's simply laughable as it's usually an obvious dub.                              Even more irritating, however, is the fact that this film fools the audience into expecting the ending on many occasions. I probably expected the climax at least three times in this movie, and then it just kept on going. It just would not end. And when it does end, it's sudden, unexpected, and without climax. I notice I'm not the only person in this forum that's complained about the ending and I surely won't be the last.                              This movie isn't even worth watching if you happen to see it on cable one day, and I certainly wouldn't recommend spending money on it. Avoid it. 2/10",The Talented Mr. Ripley
199,PippinInOz,A Classy film about Class and Desire,10,15 January 2010,"I have watched this film so many times and never ever stop seeing something new unfolding with each viewing. Everything here is spot on, the cinematography, the mise en scene, the acting, the story....you get the gist! If you haven't seen this film before, get on to it. You will not be disappointed. I noticed that a writer here asks 'Is Tom Ripley a sympathetic character?' This is an excellent question, because in many ways it points to the ambivalence the audience is positioned to feel concerning not just Tom, but all the upper class American characters. I would argue that this 'sympathy' some of us feel watching Tom is to do with class. Dickie Greenleaf's name says it all. His 'born in the money' privilege and arrogance none the less makes him 'green' (lacking in street smarts, naive) and - at times - extremely unlikeable. When Tom climbs out of his below ground flat and climbs into the car sent for him, well, he isn't going back without a fight is he? I am not defending murder here. Merely pointing out that the genius of this narrative is just how ambivalent it is - and what a scathing comment on the capitalist system where 'climbing the ladder' (quite literally Tom does this at the beginning) means getting your hands very very dirty indeed.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
200,markmuhl,Elusive like a snake,8,22 February 2018,"The movie by Anthony Minghella differs in quite some way from the older French movie Plein soleil, which is based on the same novel by Patricia Highsmith. Especially Tom Ripley (M. Damon) is quite a different character, more emotional and less coldly calculating his deeds but also alarmingly adaptive like a chameleon and elusive like a snake. In fact, his real character is quite intangible, as he is constantly taking over the roles which best meet the expectations of his environment to be exactly the person that people want to see in him. He is so spookily good in this, that people hardly realize that they are also being manipulated by Tom to his own favour. Not being accepted, however, is not part of the game and if it does happen, Tom is getting out of control. Not for very long though, since after the murder Tom soon regains control and he reaches top form in setting out wrong tracks. In this sense, however, he is very similar to the Tom Ripley given by Alain Delon in the older French movie. Another feature that makes the film different from its predecessor is the fact, that Tom's homoerotic affection to Dickie Greenleaf (J. Law) becomes obvious. In fact it is the rejection of this affection that greatly contributes to the murder, which makes it a far more emotional deed. The murder of Dickie's distrustful friend Freddy Miles, however, is in both movies a mere necessity in order to reveal the first murder, but it needs to be stated, that Freddy left a deeper impression on me in this version of the movie since the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman as young rich snob is really outstanding.I also liked the fact that Marge (G. Paltrow) in the newer version of the movie sees through Tom Ripley's game, although she cannot prove it, a fact, which drives her almost crazy. To me it is quite plausible that the person, that best knew the victim of a murder, can judge whether a faked suicide is in line with the person she used to know. This also means that Tom Ripley is actually unmasked in both movies, although it has to be conceded that from a sense of justice the two endings are truly different. That the older French movie version of the Highsmith novel does a better job in bringing across the atmosphere from the 50's can hardly be valued as a merit since the movie was almost shot in this very time. Still, from a today's point of view, it may be taken as a criterion to decide which movie should be the preferred choice.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The reason is that I sympathized very strongly with the main character. The whole manner in which Tom longed to live a life and fit in with a group of people with whom he really didn't belong, struck a chord with me because I've had those feelings before while growing up. When Tom's life spiralled into a mess of lies and murder, I had a tough time watching it. It was kind of like seeing an accident happen in slow motion. So I can't really say that I totally enjoyed it, but I can definitely appreciate the care that was put into it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

You see a mixture of clothes, shoes, and accessories in a variety of shapes, colors and sizes turned in multiple directions and angles. This my friends is The Talented Mr. Ripley. I found this movie well acted, well photographed, and the Italian landscapes were simply beautiful. But, will someone please explain this movie to me ? The plot, whatever there may have been of one, seemed manufactured and full of holes. The acting however was done especially well, Matt Damon, Jude Law, and Gwyneth Paltrow played their usual fine parts. Although, my favorite portrayal  in the movie was Freddie Miles, played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman, albeit a small part.I felt the ultimate disappointment for me in this movie was a very weak ending to a simply average movie.

It's amazing that someone as talented as Mr. Ripley couldn't manage to make a place for himself in the world. He had to be a parasite. Why? And then there's Dickie and his girlfriend. Two remarkably beautiful people living in absolute paradise, yet with no visible means of support. But that doesn't stop Dickie form buying a beautiful sailboat, living in a stunning villa on the coast of Italy, and living it up to the fullest every minute. Yeah, like so many other folks I know.But if Dickie's dad was so desperate to have him come back home, why didn't he just cut off his money? Wouldn't that have been a lot easier than sending some stranger out to collect him? And so when the really peculiar friendship between Tom and Dickie wears thin, the only recourse is to murder Dickie? Odd. And only one of numerous non-sequitors in the show.I found myself not caring about any of the characters or what they were planning or doing. I couldn't relate to any of them on any level, nor could I believe they were anything but really obnoxious caricatures.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

It proves that not only can he play a innocent light hearted character, but within a second he can pull a complete 180 and portray a dark unemotional character. Jude Law also played his role well as the spoilt playboy that he is with an acting performance that I feel has been his best so far. The involvement of Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett's characters brought more emotion to the film as the plot thickens, which gave the film a little more edge. Philip Seymour Hoffman does well at also playing the cocky rich boy character, which, lets face it, is pulled off best by him.What also made the film is the overall cinematography as the locations that most of the scenes were shot were absolutely breathtaking. Such as Rome and Venice.The overall plot was outstanding with it becoming more and more darker as the film progresses. Scenes that particularly deserve credit are the suicide scene of the Italian girl, the murder of Dicky Greenleaf, the Opera and the meeting at the Roman café. These scenes emphasise Anthony Minghella's directing capabilities.Overall, Anthony Minghella's work on this film deserves praise.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The central plot becomes lethargic and sometimes the character's actions are confusing as the story shoots off into numerous sub-plots without deciding which one to focus upon.  If it hadn't been for Jude Law's outstanding performance I would have been truly annoyed that I paid to see this in the theater.

The story is about a series of situations in which Tom Ripley keeps making the wrong decision until he is finally in so deep he does not know what to do.  Which is where the film ends - very annoying.Tom's homosexuality is kept suppressed through most of the film and none of the characters (except one) ever seem to notice. This struck me as a little far fetched.Matt Damon is superb in the film.  The supporting cast also give excellent performances.  Probably best seen on video.One thing that thoroughly irritated me was Tom's spectacles.  Sometimes they had lenses, and most times they didn't.

216,rivera66_99,Vulgarity and strength,5,1 June 2001,"Unfortunately, this movie lacks any subtlety in handling its main character. While in the book (and even in the French 1960-version) Ripley is the great enigma of 'emptiness', the 'man without character' and, therefore, one of the most interesting criminals in literature history (a more satiric version, perhaps, of Camus's ""Stranger""), the character that offer us Minghella and the (miscast) Matt Damon is a simple immature, over-timid homosexual, who would be a nice guy if he was 'identical' with himself. ""If you feel something, be consequent with it; if not, you will cause harm to others and to yourself"" - that seems to be the flat morality of this in other aspects still brilliant movie. Brilliant, because it shows a BEAUTIFUL camera work and is able to preserve enough thrilling moments from Highsmith's novel to keep us 'breathless', sometimes. Nevertheless, I found the very handsome and charismatic Jude Law the much more 'unsettling' character than Matt Damon's Ripley, HE really has a indifference and coldness that is as 'profoundly superficial' as I expected (in vain) Matt Damon to be. In this respect, the cast is of course better than in the French movie where Alain Delon gives a stunning performance but without convincing that he aspires to be the OTHER, aspect that becomes completely clear under this constellation. - 5 out of 10.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" promises a lot and manages to acquit itself quite nicely of its task. The performances are flawless and the script is great until the final 10 minutes when it gets horrible. I understood every single thing about it except the ending. Thomas had met a beautiful young man that loved him for what he was: Ripley and not Dickie Greenleaf (except he did not know about the murders). Why wasn't he able to cope with Peter, especially when his feelings were reciprocated? The final scene when Thomas remembers what he did to Peter is gut-wrenching.

Also, two scenes which stood out in the French version - the dress-up in front of the mirror, and the hilarious trip to Freddy's vehicle - just don't cut the mustard in this version ... they're very lame by comparison. I did like the movie, enjoyed it much more than I had expected. I also liked the present ending ...

There was something about him that I felt sympathetic towards on one hand and gave me the creeps on the other. Sympathetic because in more than one ways he is like you and me. He wants to be rich, he wants approval and he is may be just an opportunist. Creepy because he latches on like a leech, he can't take rejection and though he doesn't plan but once he assumes the identity of someone else he can go to any extent to keep that. Actually one can identify with the character so much that it's almost scary to look inside your dark corners.Matt Damon played this three-dimensional character so well that I almost became a huge fan of his. Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf, whose identity Tom Ripley steals was very good as well. The movie is shot in Italy, moves at a leisurely speed and is very atmospheric.

220,BuddyBoy1961,An involving mystery thriller,7,12 July 2000,"Oh, what a tangled web we weave...especially when murder is your only means of escape. Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley, a cunning sociopath whose talents for manipulation go untapped until he is mistaken for a ""somebody"" and dispatched to Europe to retrieve the estranged son of a wealthy American shipbuilder. His objective is soon displaced by a growing fascination with the lifestyle of bon vivants Dickie and Marge (Law and Paltrow), who welcome the enigmatic Tom into their home, heart and wallet. Little do they realize to what lengths Tom will go to maintain his now-treasured social status. ""English Patient"" director Anthony Minghella has impressively adapted Patricia Highsmith's acclaimed novel of a young man's dangerous obsession with materialism and identity and presents (with cinematographer John Seale) an utterly convincing late-50's environment via picturesque Italian locations. Comparisons between ""Ripley"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Strangers On A Train"" are inevitable since Highsmith was the author of both and the premises are similar. But ""Ripley"" replaces ""Stranger""'s subtle homosexual subtext with a somewhat overt subplot detailing the growing attraction Tom develops for Dickie (all but implying a direct connection between homosexuality and homicide) which almost overshadows the more important obsession/compulsion plot-line. The casting in Ripley is impeccable down to the tiniest role. Law, Paltrow and Blanchett (in a crucial supporting performance) all shine, but Damon is particularly effective. While anyone else might have overplayed the character, Damon employs an almost automatonic attitude whenever Tom Ripley is 'off'. His character seems incapable of being anything but an imitation of humanity whenever he is required to be social. But when Ripley is alone, Damon is amorphous, stoically waiting for any stimulus or circumstance with which to ingratiate himself. It is a daring but wise artistic approach.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Though the movie was long, the plot held my interest the whole way through. I loved how many scenes appeared to foreshadow the ending, yet continued the storyline which really allowed me to feel engaged in everything that was going on. I actually wanted to see more after each scene. I didn't expect Tom to be able to steer clear of criminal charges, but somehow he continues to do so each moment that I suspect he will get caught.It's very interesting how the audience can see the instability of Tom when he maintains a very calm disposition throughout the movie. Since he has such a calm behavior and he carries himself as such a friendly and decent person, it was difficult for me to accept the fact that he rather than someone more ruthless began leading a double life.

If he were Dickie, all of his problems and his entire past would be swept away and life would be perfect..The plot of this film is very well-crafted and interesting.  What would happen if someone were to assume another person's identity while they themself were known to many people still around?  This film attempts to show us just that and succeeds in a storyline that is actually quite believable, no matter how shocking it gets.  The performances in this film are fantastic.  It is obvious that all of the actors and actresses really spent time trying to become their characters. 
This movie was worthy of the Oscar nominations, but it definitely isn't a GREAT film.  The problem is that the film is just far too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes.  The main turning point of the film is just halfway through, and before that the film starts to get very repetitive and almost boring. If this film could have been cut down to an hour and 50 minutes or so it would have been much more attention-deserving and worthy of a 9 or 10.

But hark! Thine film was not half-bad! But, without the help of the aforementioned Matt and Gwyneth. See this flick for all its Hitchcockian nuances, see it for crafty supporters Jude Law, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and see it for the admirable direction of Anthony Minghella.
But, as for poor Matt, he seems simply normal. I have yet to truly discover Damon, I suppose - in widely lauded turns such as Good Will Hunting, Saving Private Ryan and this film, he simply appears as Matt Damon playing Will Hunting, Matt Damon playing Private Ryan and Matt Damon playing Tom Ripley.

What I got instead was a long and confusing film with a one-dimensional cartoon character Tom Ripley played by Damon, and a climax that we wait so long for, that when it finally arrives your long past snoring in your seat.Matt Damon was visibly disturbed at not receiving an Academy Award nomination for this inept film, but I have to ask him what he could possibly have thought he deserved one for?  His so-called impersonation of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law's character) is an insult to viewers with an IQ over 50 and one can only think that Jude Law and Matt Damon should have played each other's roles because Law has the dark mysterious quality about him while Damon's dimples and generally All-American look take away from his bad-boy persona.  Jude Law completely steals the show even when there's really not a show to steal and the movie lacks any excitement once he's off the screen. The casting directors must have assumed that Gwyneth Paltrow would give the pathetic script an uplift having just come off of her win for Shakespeare in Love but she is also horribly miscast as Marge Greenwood, girlfriend to Dickie, who really doesn't know him very well after all. The film has an ending that cheats viewers and allows a felon to get off scot-free.  We sit through two hours gazing at the lovely scenery of Italy and wonder why the hapless script can't be as enchanting as the beaches.

229,moselekm,"""I'd rather be a fake somebody, than a real nobody...""",9,6 April 2010,"I'd have to say The_Void really sums up on how amazing this film is and because I find his library of reviews so helpful, I will link them now: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur2248099/comments?order=date&start=0 His review should definitely take precedence over all other Reviews for this film (and probably a lot more). I write this review for the chance that if someone liked one of my opinions, they'd come and see what I thought of this masterpiece.I can't remember that last time I felt my heart jerked like this in some time. Well that is a lie, I do remember. The last time would have had to of been when I saw: Match Point. So let's get the 'if you liked/hated' bust out of the way and say if you liked Woody Allen's Match Point, I can't see why you wouldn't ultimately like this. Not that they're AT ALL the same, nor do I have some sort of expertise on the matter. I just know the rare feeling Match Point gave me is the same this movie gave me. It sets so many moods and it does it with such finesse you find yourself begging for more and more in a devilish fashion you'll catch yourself many times wondering why you're rooting for Mr. Ripley.The movie is only 2 hours and 20 minutes or there abouts. But it feels like a lifetime. Not the sort of lifetime when you're waiting in the DMV. The sort of life time where you experience, learn, and think about through your life. Not to say this film is a learning experience. But it IS an experience and it will fill a hole in your film-going life for that thick-plot, character ran, and dark trenching void you may have. I can't think of a film that quite compares in sequence of events, twists, character development, character inclusion quite like this.Every character is important, every event is important, and everything you think is pretty null and void. Or possibly that is just me.It should be heavily noted that this film STARTS SLOW, as many have said and probably judged it that way. I'd say it picks up speed around the 15-20 minute mark and it roller coasters from there. And let me tell you, when it accelerates, it seriously doesn't know how to stop and personally, I never wanted it to stop. This is the sort of film where not even the most annoying person can scream at the film, because you're too tight lipped about everything going on and you'll most likely find yourself wanting Ripley to keep going. And when I say Ripley, I really mean the movie.And the movie doesn't stop, it keeps going. Even after it's over, you will be doing a mental tango of all the information you have received and trying to sort out all the pieces. And trust me, there are pieces. If you go to watch this film to just watch a 90's flick, you're doing it wrong. You will probably find the movie a flop of just dark moments led by lies and deceit. (Which it really is). But to those who went to watch this film because we wanted to know why there was so much mixed hype about this 1999 film, we should have all noticed there were the smallest bits of puzzle pieces and the biggest amounts of twists that really made this film what it is.I don't even like Matt Damon, I personally have a biased grudged towards the guy and his movies. But I'd have to say, it's tough to choose between his performances here and Good Will Hunting. He, along with the entire cast will tug at heart strings you never thought you had. There are the strings for romance, thrillers, and horror. These strings are the one's collecting dust and sometimes never see the light of day for a life time. It's rare to come across a film that seems to have everything and goes about it like it's nothing, like it doesn't even seem to care if you're watching or not, because it all is going to happen with or without you. It's truly it's own living, breathing, and dark entity.Watch this film if you want a film that will bake in your brain for the days, weeks, maybe months to come. It's not to late to bring this movie back up into lunch-time conversation in the new century.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

This is the kind of film that makes you question a lot of things here's why.The film is about a young man named tom ripley, who buy his own admittance specializes in ""Forging Signatures, lieing, pretending to be something he's not"". he's kinda nerdy in a way but very intelligent. He is asked by a man to find his son DickieGreenleaf in Italy and to convince him to come back to new York. he is given one thousand dollars to do so. tom go's to Italy and he finds Dickie. Dickie is happy with his girlfriend marge and refuses to go back. Tom becomes so intrigued with Dickie's lifestyle that he decides to stay in taly without. But when Dickie becomes an obssesion of Tom's things take a mysterious turn.First of all Matt Damon was great in this film. in fact sometimes he's too convincing, which is good. He makes Tom a believable chracter making us feel sorry for him during certain moments. I don't know if this is Jude Laws first movie, but he was pretty good too. he almost matches matt damon's performance. he's very convincing as the spoiled dickie. Gwenneth Paltrow is also good, in a very suttle, but good performance.The reason i called this film disturbing was because i think we all want to be someone else sometimes. i think it's human nature to be more and to acheive more. sometimes we go so far to be someone else that it becomes disturbing and it consumes. that's why this film tripped me out. it makes that need to be someone else frightenely real",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Made the Police and the private eye look incompetent.They could've done even more with the dual identity thing than they did, this was the best thing going for it.

234,EJBaggaley,The Talented who?,5,17 December 2004,"The film 'The talented Mr. Ripley' is about a boy named Tom Ripley(Matt Damon) who gets paid to reside in Italy from America, by a man named Herbert Greenleaf(James Rebhorn) to convince his son Dickie Geenleaf(Jude Law) to leave Italy and return to his family in America. As Tom Ripley took Mr. Greenleafs offer, he then tracked down Dickie Greenleaf in Italy and befriended him. As Tom realised that there was no chance that he was going to convince Dickie to return to America, he then told Dickie that he was hired by Dickies father to convince him to leave Italy and return to America. Dickie found it quite amusing that his father would go to such extremes to get him back and decided to play his father along by writing him letters saying how great Tom is and that Tom was a good influence in his life, without letting on that he knew that his father hired Tom.This films storyline/plot is one of the silliest story lines I have ever seen in a movie. First of all, there's no way a man would on the spur of the moment hire a complete stranger that he meets in an airport, to track his son down in Italy, to convince him to move back to America. Second of all, there's no chance that a cool guy like Dickie Greenleaf who has a beautiful girlfriend(Gwyneth Paltrow) would befriend a nerdy guy like Tom Ripley and letting him move into his home and giving everything he wants - it just wouldn't happen. Later on in the film, Tom unplanningly kills Dickie in a row boat and from then on pretended to be Dickie by living in his home and by using his identification. I thought that was quite realistic, as it was the only realistic bit of this film that would happen in real life. However, the whole bit of Tom masquerading to be Dickie, I found took up half the film, for it just dragged on and on, which resulted this film in getting nowhere. One good thing I can say about this film, is that the acting was brilliant, especially by Jude Law(Dickie Greenleaf) for his acquired American accent was quite convincing and his talent of acting emotional was well performed. I wouldn't say that this film was terrible, but I wouldn't call it an average film either. It had its okay moments, but on whole I found this film boring and wouldn't recommend anybody to watch it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
235,sean_36,stunning psychological thriller,9,10 December 2001,"Matt Damon plays a gay (well, sort of) sociopath in this extremely entertaining film by the director of the English Patient.  Damon is sent to Italy by the parents of a rich boy who want him brought back to America, but when he meets the man he becomes obsessed with him and his playboy lifestyle.  Ripley decides he does'nt want to go back to America but would rather stay in Italy, but when Dickie (the man he was sent to retreave) decides he's had enough of Damon, Mr. Ripley's murderous intsincts are brought out.  The Tatented Mr. Ripley is not only a great movie because of it's great scenery, but also because it shows Damon's psychological development from a real nobody to a fake somebody.  And also how he manages to elude the police in a daring cat and mouse game.  This is a brilliantly dark film about obsession and longing to be someone better than yourself.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
236,bootlebarth,Implausible plot in scenic settings,5,28 September 2008,"'The Talented Mr Ripley' is a very silly film. It is a perfect example of how style can triumph over substance. From start to finish the plot is 100% nonsense. A geekish lavatory attendant (Tom Ripley/Matt Damon) stands in as an accompanist wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. This is enough for a shipping magnate in the audience to finance him to go to Italy and bring back his playboy son (Dickie Greenleaf/Jude Law).Ripley falls in love with Dickie's life and with Dickie himself. For a while he manages to attach himself, leechlike, to the black sheep. His first advances, hinting at a game of nude bathtub chess, are rebuffed. An improbable turning point occurs when the hithertho nerdish Tom slices open the side of Dickie's head with an oar during an unlikely boat trip for two and then beats him to a lifeless pulp in the biffo that follows.From this point, Ripley leads a double life, as himself and his victim. When rumbled by one of Dickie's old chums (Freddie/Philip Seymour Hoffman) he turns to murder again. The net seems to be closing in but Ripley keeps wriggling free. Writer/Director Antony Minghella uses the oldest trick in the book to distract viewers from the hollowness of the plot. Just as a skillful conjuror diverts the gaze of the audience from where the trick is really happening, so Minghella disengages our critical faculties with picturesque backdrops of Rome, Venice and even Jude Law's posterior.The cast do well enough, apart from Matt Damon who wouldn't have got a look in at a 'Queer as Folk' audition. None of the characters they play invite empathy, so the viewer scarcely cares who might live or die, and whether Ripley will get away with his literally incredible double life. Surely the hard-boiled American private detective hired by Greenleaf Senior will unravel the tissue of lies and coincidences? Nope. Fade to unreadable titles and who cares? The stars of this film are the locations and the art direction. Without them it would be the disaster the absurd and wholly unbelievable plot deserves.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
237,Sally_Kirkland,"Not a bad movie at all, but close to be one...",3,3 May 2000,"This film is highly overrated when it comes to the plot, the characters, the setting and the location.The fault is not the actors though. It is undoubtly Anthony Minghella's - he, who also directed the true stinker ""The English Patient"". Once again his love for the pittoresque Italy gives us a bizarre environment - showing us this pretty European country that gets so pretty it is grotesque.Whenever Dickie or Tom or Marge or ANYONE passes the streets of Rome or Mongibello, there is either some nuns, a priest or a woman selling water melons! The Italy of it simply gets too Italian! And the characters dances as stars around in this poor, under developped but charming little country.When it comes to the characters and the plot, it is evidently that Minghella has destroyed Patricia Highsmith's novel, which is quite allright. We never get to believe in Tom Ripley as a person, since he in Minghellas film simply gets too good at doing what he does. The foolishness peaks when the American detective Macmarron cannot see through his obvious lies. It is a shame for Matt Damon, who basically is being foolish in this film and never giving us an opportunity to see what he can do.Dickie Greenleaf is actually the true hero of this film. I wish he had been killing Tom instead and so we could have been seeing some more of the talented Jude Law. Gwyneth Paltrow's Marge is simply unbelieveable. People like her does not exist. And Gwyneth tries to save this poor fact by playing herself. So - Gwyneth is Gwyneth.Cate Blanchett of course get a lot out of being Meredith - a blindfolded poor girl. I guess this film shows who really should have been given the Best Actress Oscar of '99....Anthony Minghella means kitsch. As he is pouring people, things and Italy together in the way too beautiful pictures, he destroys finally this film. It is really a shame.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
238,schreiber-stephen,The Talented Mr. Frank Abagnale meets the Talented Mr. Norman Bates,4,20 January 2014,"Anthony Minghella, director and screenplay writer of the English Patient and Cold Mountain in addition to this film, open The Talented Mr. Ripley with a bang. It starts off with such promise and is intriguing. The photography in this film is excellent and the acting is superb. Minghella certainly knows how to get the most out of his given crop of talent. The great thing about the direction of this film is that it holds up extremely well. It is not hard to get through but the story itself will leave your skin crawling which is another testament to how well each actor performs right down to the most minor of characters.The Talented Mr. Ripley is a mix between Catch Me If You Can and Psycho. Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) seems like a normal kid who catches a break while wearing a jacket that does not belong to him. Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) offers to pay Tom to bring his son back from Europe. The amount of money offered to Tom seems like it might be more than Tom has seen in his entire life. Wearing that jacket is what starts Tom on this journey to try and be someone more interesting than himself. He is a deeply troubled character with little to no self worth. He loves everyone he meets more than himself and never wants to leave their sides. Tom eventually meets Herbert Greenleaf's son, Dickie (Jude Law). Tom, Dickie and Dickie's fiancé Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) eventually become extremely close friends. Tom uses his talents of impersonation and desire to become anyone but himself to stay with Dickie for as long as possible. They string Herbert Greenleaf along and have him continue to funnel money to the two of them for as long as possible. Dickie eventually begins to tire of being around Tom and begins to make a new friend, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman). This is about the time where the movie takes a bit of a turn. The events up to this point all trigger a downward spiral as this movie begins to tear down each character and the relationships developed. The unraveling of Tom Ripley is quite substantial. Once Tom's first layer is gone, he replaces it with a layer not of his own until almost every part of Tom Ripley is gone with the exception of the cold and dark core that he cannot let anyone into.The Talented Mr. Ripley is an excellent movie that I feel I can only watch once because it becomes very tough to get through. Anthony Minghella does a great job in putting you in the world of Tom Ripley but in doing so makes the viewing experience quite dark in certain spots. Tom is a mold waiting to be shaped into those around him and as he gathers information about other characters Anthony Minghella is painting a wonderful picture of every character in the film. Each character is extremely complex and this film would not be the same without every one of those pieces. This character study is one of the best ones as each character brings something different. Tom wants to be anyone but himself and will stop at nothing to achieve that goal and keep his idols around him. Dickie is a self centered rich kid who uses everyone he meets including his fiancé. Speaking of her, Marge wants nothing more than to have Dickie love her unconditionally. She fears that he will use her and toss her aside which may not be far from the truth. Freddie is probably the biggest wild card among the group as you don't get to learn much about Freddie other than he is on par with Dickie in terms of social status and he steals the show whenever he is on screen. Much of that might just be attributed to Philip Seymour Hoffman's incredible acting as he seems to trump everything around him whenever he is on screen.I would suggest that everyone see this movie at least once for the acting alone as it almost appears as if Minghella would not quit until every take was excellent. Tom Ripley will leave your skin crawling for days.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
239,TheFilmFreak1,Hitchcockian Brilliance,9,25 February 2011,"After the success of 'The English Patient', director Anthony Minghella conceived of his next project as another adaptation (after Rene Clement's 'Plein Soleil') of Patricia Highsmith's 1955 pulp novel 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'. While Clement's version is generally excellent and intelligently conceived, the censorship constrains of the era rendered the film too subdued in its treatment of the homoerotic sexual undertones of the source material to really have an impact on the audience. Mingella's film, however, is substantially more explicit and candourous in both its theme and content, permitting both for the characters to be depicted in all their multifaceted and variable glory and for a visceral degree of suspense to develop long before the bodies even start piling up.Concurrently a modernist exploration of film noir – stressing the Byzantine plot schematics, dreamlike visuals, and behavioural factors of the genre's archetypes with delicious hyperbole – and a conservative dissection of vanity and hedonism (something of a contrast with Highsmith's glorification of those things in her original novel), the film primarily looks at social status, with the work's two main characters – Tom Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf (two excellent performances from Matt Damon and Jude Law – representing the higher (Dickie) and lower (Tom) levels of the social taxonomy.By using film noir's archetypes – characters whom either allow their affluence or high social status to persuade them to pursue impossible goals or whom, if poor, obsess with 'making a quick buck' –, Minghella is able to both mock the vices of high society and, through investing sympathy in Ripley's character through the indifferent and intermittently cruel behaviour that Dickie directs toward him, expose both the superficiality and the manipulative and temporal nature of a high social status (along with the 'la dolce vita' lifestyle it connotes). However, this point is most effectively illustrated not through Dickie's representation of the upper classes, but through Tom Ripley's destructive pursuit of them. From the film's opening montage of Ripley's squalid existence in the ghettos of New York, we see his burning desire to be among a higher class of people surmised brilliantly with such images as him wiping a rich man's jacket in his capacity as a lavatory attendant and his forbidden look into a recital from behind the curtain of a personal booth. Ripley is willing to do practically anything to achieve a higher status; firstly becoming acquainted with jazz (which he clearly dislikes) as a means to befriend Dickie, then demonstrating all his skills of mimicry and forging, along with revealing the intent of his meeting Dickie, to preserve that friendship, to finally killing Dickie and stealing his identity.As matters escalate, so do Ripley's methods of preserving his wrongfully-obtained status. He murders Dickie's inquisitive friend Freddie Miles (a Seymour Hoffman performance fleetingly glimpsed though worthy of a thousand accolades), fakes Dickie's suicide, attempts to murder Dickie's former fiancée Marge Sherwood (Paltrow in one of her better roles), and, in the film's haunting dénouement, murders Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport), the only character in the whole film who has the potential to offer Tom some sort of salvation. And as Ripley's finally descends into an incubus of guilt and regret, the film finally presents his status anxiety as hubris with the line ""I always thought it would be better, to be a fake somebody... than a real nobody.""Yet these reflections are simply the eventualities of the film's exploration of it's thematic concerns; what really matters is that this is a beautifully photographed (John Seale's best work), superbly scripted, wonderfully acted, exquisitely scored (Gabriel Yared channels Bernard Herrmann with such professional austerity that one would think that Yared is Herrmann's reincarnation), and, dare I write, 'talentedly' directed. This, for me, is Minghella's magnum opus!",The Talented Mr. Ripley
240,Manji,Praise be to Ripley!,9,21 January 2001,"Initially, when I saw this film paraded around on the idiot box i was naturally disgusted! I was one of those people who felt that Gwyneth had lost her touch after winning an Oscar for her subpar performance in ""Shakespeare In Love"". This is excuse alone kept me far from any theater that was carrying this film in stock. Then a dear friend of mine told me that ""The Talented mr. Ripley"" was ""poppycock"", my friend is British, forgive her please, heh heh. So for the longest time i steered clear from what i perceived to be the film wreck of '99, after all, I thought and still believe that Fight Club was the greatest movie released in '99.So then I'm watching tv, low and behold, what movie has just come on cable here in Canada, but ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". So, I said to myself, WHAT THE HECK, I actually rented ""I Spit On Your Grave"" once, just for fun, may as well give this garbage a chance.... ...when the movie finished, I thought that I was a complete damn fool! The entire time, I didn't even feel like I was watching a movie!!! I felt like I had been invited along with Ripley to experience one of the most bizarre stories of twisted human nature. How did I get taken??? Try the incredible acting, the beautiful dialogue/screenplay, and the absolutely breathtaking direction of Anthony Minghella. But the man who made this movie, without a doubt in the world, was Matt Damon. The guy is cinematic gold, his portrayal of Tom Ripley was more than just acting, it was carving a mark in dramatic history. Before I even started watching the movie, I figured he was going to play it really poorly (possibly still drunk off of his success from ""Good Will Hunting""). But it wasn't like that at all, instead I was treated to a refreshing performance by one of the film industries' next screen legends, that is if he can continue to choose awesome roles like Ripley!But none of this is to downsize my appreciation for the rest of the cast, everyone did a stellar job, yes even Gwyneth. Even though I still can't stand her, she provided a wonderful foil for Jude Law and Matt Damon to play off of. Cate Blanchett is a beaut and a hoot as always! And P.T. Anderson alumni Phillip Seymour Hoffman & Phillip Baker Hall just made me cheer every time I saw them grace the screen with their presence.I had a great time watching this movie, it is the most memorable experience that I have had for the year, film-wise! Now I have to go read the book to get complete closure on some issues that arose. A movie like this makes me want to scream to the sky, ""NOW THAT IS A F**KING FILM!!!""LOL, just go watch the movie before you lose anymore respect for me.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
241,The Truth,A sympathetic murderer.,8,7 April 2000,"The first thing that came into my mind after seeing The Talented Mr. Ripley was Alfred Hitchcock. Like Hitchcock's Rope and Dial M For Murder (among others), this is a murder story where the audience doesn't want the murderer to be caught. But, whereas in those Hitchcock films the viewer simply wants to see how the murderers' succeed in their complex plans, in Mr. Ripley there is also genuine sympathy for the main character, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon). The murders he commits are done in an awkward way, and there is no pleasure in watching these scenes build up (as in M) nor in seeing how the trails are covered (as in Rope). The sympathetic nature of Tom Ripley brings him closer to Norman Bates in Hitchcock's Psycho. Like Bates, Ripley does not murder for fun or profit, but because he is forced to. Only the first killing, the murder of Ripley's best friend Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) is a crime of passion, and because of Greenleaf's behaviour the deed seems almost justified. The difference between Ripley and Bates is that, regardless of his motives, Ripley (unlike Bates) is still conscious of his actions. Surprisingly enough, this does not lessen our sympathy for Ripley. On the contrary: we accept Ripley's crimes because we understand why he commits them. I guess we all would choose the evil we can relate to over the one we can't, and that's why we're less afraid of the unconfident Tom Ripley than the schizophrenic Norman Bates.One of the main reasons why The Talented Mr. Ripley succeeds in portraying a likable murderer is Matt Damon. He looks just like the everyman Tom Ripley is, and his acting hits the right notes throughout the film. His nyanced performance perfectly displays the mannerisms of a man with low self-esteem and fragile personality. So good is Damon, that we have no problems in understanding why the poor and average-looking Ripley both loves and envies the rich and beautiful Dickie Greenleaf, played by the angel-like Jude Law. In my books Matt Damon was the best male lead of 1999, no matter what the The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
242,wezzel,The Talented Mr. Minghella,10,22 August 2001,"Contains Spoilers I was shocked to see how many negative comments this film got, it's one of the best films of 1999!Much has been said about the actors.  Schoolboy Matt Damon wouldn't be able to play a psychopath and Gwyneth Paltrow does enough acting for the whole cast.  I don't agree.  Damon, an actor I generally don't like, does an unbelievable job as Ripley.  We are (or at least I was) rooting for him all the way through, which is remarkable, since Ripley is a murdering creep. In fact, Ripley is so fascinating I found myself turning against Gwyneth Paltrow's character, who is the only one 'on' to him.  If you, as an actor, can provoke such emotion to a critical viewer as myself, you're doing a great job.  Special remark for Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who plays one of the most irritating people I have ever see( imagine my joy when Ripley killed him)Much has been said about the pacing.  And indeed, this movie takes its time to explore characters and locations, instead of giving us non-stop violence and murder.  How dare they?Much has been said about the ending.  When I first saw this film in the theaters, I saw the scene when Ripley sat on his bed and I thought ""Ok, if it ends now this is one of the best films ever"". And it ended. The good guys don't always win people, the ending gives the film another touch of grim realism.I've read all the Ripley novels by Highsmith.  They're fairly interesting, showing us how Ripley lives in France, is happily married (so much for the homo-erotic undertone) and still does his occasional murder when the situation demands for it.

Fine acting, wonderful directing, interesting camera angles and lighting lush settings, mesmerizing music, serpentine plot - this is a haunting film, with profound comments about the human need for identity and community. This film gave me new respect for both the director, Minghella and actor, Damon. Mr. Ripley is an interesting character with whom we identify in his isolation and desperation and frustration with being one of society's pariahs which makes him also disturbing, since he is a serial killer.

A lesser movie would be scared of confusing the viewer, but Anthony Minghella trusts on the talent on screen and our perception of what is happening and let the story flow.
Damon's acting is among the best of his whole career (a career filled with insanely good performances) and he deserves a lot of praise for how much he shows with very subtle things.
Law's depiction of a soulless playboy is on point and when the two share the screen, a lot happens. But, like Damon's character, most of everything happens in the shadows, in little nuances and non-spoken moments.

Academy Award winning director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) follows up with this flick. With the luscious art direction of the 1950's Italy and great acting, THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY deserves its praise.Tom Ripley, played by Good Will Hunting's Matt Damon, goes through his life thinking that it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.

253,Tresy,Icy near-perfection (possible spoilers),9,25 September 2000,"As expertly played by Matt Damon, Tom Ripley is perpetually on the outside looking in: as a theatre janitor envying the lives of the actors he sees onstage; as the plebeian hired pianist at the upper-class Manhattan soiree; as the desperate hanger-on among the idle rich US expatriate community in Italy. He is, in short, class-driven like so many Americans in our ""classless"" society. Unlike most of the rest of us, however, his class envy drives him to serial murder. Why?In a famous exchange, F. Scott Fitzgerald once remarked to Hemingway, ""The Rich are different from you and me."" To which Hemingway tartly replied, ""Yes. They have more money.""The Talented Mr. Ripley puts this argument to the test. Certainly the plot suggests, and Tom Ripley desperately hopes, that Hemingway is correct, that being Rich is simply a matter of trappings and appurtenances. Indeed, the entire plot springs from the erroneous class signal given off by Tom's borrowed Princeton jacket. But this is the tragedy of Tom. Despite his chameleonic ability to take on the protective coloration of his surroundings, his non-U origins keep giving him away, most infuriatingly, to the smug, class-conscious playboy Fredo (the ever-enjoyable Phillip Seymour Hoffman). In another person--hopefully most of us--that would be a matter of embarrassment, even humiliation. But for Tom, it's an incitement to homicidal rage.Why? In part because although Tom is trapped by the social and sexual mores of his world, he sees through them quite clearly, yet he cannot do anything about it. Indeed, everyone in this movie is unhappy in varying degrees, and the root is a disconnect between social roles and individual character. The homoerotic sublplot is revealing: Tom, a closeted gay man, thinks that his playboy friend Dickie Greenleaf is in the closet, and the movie suggests obliquely that he is right. Aside from a the erotically charged bathtub scene (where Tom & Dickie play a symbolically charged game of chess while Tom tries to draw Dickie out of his unconscious closet), the movie shows DIckie as a compulsive philanderer who only shows physical interest in girlfriend Marge (the luscious Gwyneth Paltrow) when necessary to pacify her lonely restiveness. You don't have to be Sigmund Freud to figure out the eponymously named Dickie. Yet when Tom truthfully tells Dickie that he has never lied to him, and asks him to confront his homoerotic feelings for Tom, Dickie not only rebuffs him, he emotionally destroys him. For Tom, whose sense of self is entirely measured by his reflection in the eyes of others, this is a lethal attack that justifies deadly force in self-defence. This is the other part of the explanation for Tom's dramatic arc. Like his fellow narcissistic closet-case, Norman Bates, Tom lacks any kind of center. It is no coincidence that a movie preoccupied with Tom's character gives us NO clue as to his background or upbinging. He is in fact a psychological cipher whose very lack of self ironically manifests itself as self-loathing. And this self-loathing, when awakened by Dickie, drives him to take on the identity of his tormentor. In both cases this is only a temporary solution, however, because the basic problems remain unsolved.It's to this movie's credit, however, that it resists reductionistic explanations for Tom. Centrally, the movie is explicitly ambiguous about Tom's consciousness of his own emerging pathology: although he only kills Dickie after extended provocation, and takes his identity as an almost afterthought, earlier in the movie he is seen practicing Italian while spying on dickie through binoculars. As we see Dickie for the first time, Tom rehearses the symbolic line: ""This is my face.""The dialectic of appearance vs. essence, of social roles vs individual desire, of guilt vs. revenge pulsates throughout the movie and is in part what drives its clockwork-like plot twists--a clockwork plot that in many ways reflects the grinding oppressivenss of the world the characters inhabit. In a culture where movies pander to its American audience's sentimental ideas about classlessness, sexual liberation, and upward mobility, The Talented Mr. Ripley is a witty, intelligent, and icily cold splash of cold water in the face. It deserves wide appreciation.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
254,zordy,postcard Italy,4,1 October 2006,"Paltrow et al. have declared that the great pleasure of being in this film was to have enjoyed a long vacation in Italy. For sure they've been in beautiful places. But since Italy seems to be, also in actors opinion, the main character of this film, I'd like to warn all viewers that the place it is not Italy at all, but a sort of parody inspired by a Stendhal syndrome gone asunder. I had the impression of watching actors move in a conventional postcard or in bad pictures taken by the average tourist. Do you really think that hairy bus conductors and badly shaved priests normally goes for a singing duet in the piazza near the sea, for instance? Probably, had the film set in Spain, we'd seen people dancing flamenco in the morning instead of breakfast with bulls running in the streets in the background. What is acceptable in a TV commercial makes a feature film lousy.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

That being said, it was certainly creepy and disturbing.  The problem with the movie in terms of mainstream is that while the acting is well done, none of the characters are likeable not to mention the story line is, I repeat, just plain creepy. If you like weird movies you'll probably appreciate this one even if you don't like it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
256,Mike-469,Underwhelming,5,26 December 1999,"***WARNING***(MILD)PLOT SPOILERS*** This film really disappointed me.  It had an interesting premise, but the most interesting parts of the plot were never developed.  Near the beginning of the movie, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) tells us that his talent is impersonating people -- taking over their character and identity.  He even demonstrates this with a little voice mimicry that is really impressive. Then, we are lead to believe, Tom is going to use this talent to take over Dickie Greenleaf's life and character, but this simply doesn't happen. Sure, he pretends to be Dickie to different people at different times, which leads to a lot of predictable confusion, but never does Tom actually take on Dickie's mannerisms and ticks.  In fact, in the latter half of the film, one of Dickie's friends even remarks that a room that Dickie supposedly decorated (but that Tom actually did) reflects absolutely nothing of Dickie's personality.  This is such a lost opportunity! As I said above, the plot turns are ultimately predictable, once you catch on to the basic premise of the movie.  Man lies, man lies some more to cover up old lies, and is finally driven to murder to keep everything straight. Maybe some of this would have seemed sharper and fresher if the film moved along more briskly, but instead, everything is drawn out so much that things just get boring. The acting is competent, but no one really shines except for Gwyneth Paltrow.  I must commend Matt Damon, though, for taking this gutsy role -- it certainly cast him against type, and it was a brave career move for him to take it.  The script was not really up to snuff.  Movies like this need sharp, subtle dialogue to keep you interested when the plot can't, but some of the dialogue here was painfully obvious and transparent. I think this movie would have done better if it had been made in black and white during the 1950s.  If made back then, it would have had to have been more creative in disclosing some of its darker sexual undercurrents, which would have made the movie all the more interesting.  The plot of this movie belongs squarely in the '50s, and having it made in the cynical '90s deprives it of a critical sense of genuineness.  It's just like watching the '90s remake of ""Psycho"": even if some of the plot points were there, it just never feels quite right.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
257,ProfDave,"The future of Hollywood, combined in one of the year's biggest thrillers",10,10 March 2000,"Matt Damon is by no means one of those hunky, flash-in-the-pan riff-raff actors, but is talented, dynamic, diverse, and, more importantly, plausible. Putting his award-winning writing aside, he is a magnificent actor, and reinforces that, here.It takes a truly gifted man to play a totally decadent human being that we can still have sympathy for (and even root for). Damon embodies the character, wholeheartedly, and we admire the intricacies, intricacies that exist despite the fact that the character's personality is somewhat bland (and strangely bourgeois; Ripley's sexual orientation seems to come into question, on that note, but that is subtly dealt with, and so it should be; it maintains the enigma that surrounds him).Credit goes to the rest of the cast, as well; Blanchett is, if not dynamic, at least a delightful presence. Paltrow continues to surprise me with her performances (I used to think that she was a flash-in-the-pan; how wrong I was). Hoffman subtly continues to prove what an asset he is to the industry, and golden boy Jude Law is captivating in his own portrayal of decadence.The best contributor to the movie is Minghella, the man who assembles all of these Hollywood talents. Not only is his writing superb (remembering that this is the man who turned Ondaatje's complex novel into that famous '96 Best Picture), but so is the feel of the film, that of a Hollywood classic, resurrected and restored from thirty or forty years ago (and when thinking about it, the cast is well-selected, for they have the aura similar to that of past Hollywood legends). And, of course, there is the insertion of contemporary wit and energy.The film was an absolute delight to see, and is a hands-down masterpiece, a credit to every participant's portfolio.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
258,YouRebelScum,You simply must see this remarkable film,10,9 September 2003,"Although it was compared - generally unfavourably - withMinghella's previous, Oscar-winning effort, 'The English Patient', Iactually think 'The Talent Mr. Ripley' is the better film. Beautifullydirected, with career-best performances from Jude Law, MattDamon and Gwyneth Paltrow, this is an outstanding film in everysense. It's an indication of the film's quality that Cate Blanchett andPhilip Seymour Hoffman appear only in supporting roles! Other writers have covered the contents of the film so I'll restrictmyself to saying a little about two masters of cinema workingbehind the scenes of this movie, whose presence elevated it fromsimply a very workable thriller to something special: Firstly, Aussie cinematographer John Seale, who also worked withMinghella on 'The English Patient' makes this film look bothgorgeous and sinister at the same time. He's taken us intodifferent worlds before (think of his lensing on 'The MosquitoCoast', 'Beyond Rangoon', 'Gorillas in the Mist' and, for a moreoblique yet perhaps more effective comparison, 'Witness') and anyfilm he works on will look nothing less than gorgeous, but his workhere is really something special: the heat and opulence of Sicilyand Palermo and Venice's oft-vaunted but rarely captured sense ofdisquiet all radiate off the screen. Secondly, master sound designer and film editor Walter Murch(generally accepted as the Yoda of sound/editing in Hollywood)imbues the film with a sense of melancholy that contradicts butsomehow perfectly complements the lush visuals. There's onesequence where Tom (Matt Damon) leaves his grisly basementapartment  opposite a butchers in New York, to begin his quest. Inthe next scene, he's arriving at customs in Italy and a crane shotslowly lowers us down into the cavernous body of the customshall. Throughout, Bach's 'Mache Dich, Mein Herze, Rein' from St.Matthew's Passion is playing. It's a quietly astonishing series ofimages and sounds that convey to the viewer, without them reallybeing aware of it, that the character has journeyed from one worldto another. It's also classic Murch, and recalls the famous openingto 'Apocalypse Now' where Martin Sheen - to the tune of The Doors'apocalyptic 'The End' - goes from his drunken suicide-dive in aSaigon hotel room to being interviewed by Army brass. Talking of sound, mention must also be made of Gabriel Yared'shaunting soundtrack, which creates the required mood ofsuspense and melancholy and includes the extraordinarilyunsettling song 'Lullaby for Cain', sung by Sinead O'Connor, thatopens the film. I believe 'The Talented Mr Ripley' is actually a masterwork that, forsome reason, wasn't acknowledged as such. See it soon.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
259,beautiful_suburban_midnight,One of the best movies of '99..,10,15 August 2001,"I went to see this movie after I heard that my friend said it was ""horrible"", and that basically means it'll be a good movie (9 times out of ten, my theory is correct). I thought it was extremely good then, and when i rented it recently, the scene where Ripley holds Dickie in his arms, sobbing in the boat, blood around them.. it sent a chill down my spine, literally.
Matt Damon does a wonderful job in this, and as much as I hate Gwyneth Paltrow, I liked the other acting jobs in this as well. It definately deserved more oscars, but when it was up against ""American Beauty"", well..that's like being up against ""Titanic"".. 10/10",The Talented Mr. Ripley
260,SlayerFaith007,The Misunderstood Mr Ripley,10,26 June 2003,"This film is brilliant, although most people who are either not Gay or dont know squat about Gay history will misinterpret Tom Ripley as the villian of the film. Tom is the victim of circumstance, as a lonely poor desperate Gay man in the 1950's Tom no doubt is in the closet and desperately in need of love, acceptance, and opportunity. Its no wonder he is seduced by the life that Dickie takes for granted. Dickie is the real villian in this film--spoiled, sexist, shallow--its his violent temper that forces Tom to DEFEND HIMSELF--and we learn that Dickie nearly killed a man when he lost his temper years earlier--I applaud Tom for taking the life Dickie took for granted after the ACCIDENT--Tom can appreciate Dickies life more than Dickie ever could cause Tom's life has been one of neglect, solitude, and fear (something Dickie never experienced).  Gwenyth Paltrow is good as the dimwitted, yet observant spoiled brat engaged to Dickie (how dumb can you be to marry a man destined to screw you over to satisfy his own ego).  I love this film--for myself its a feel good film with a tragic ending--again because he doesnt really have a choice (go to jail for self defense or sacrifice just one more person for a live of wealth and priviledge--Tom makes the right choice--there are dozens of men in the world but only one chance for Tom to get what he deserves).

261,jiujitsu_jesus,A film and a half,10,10 June 2005,"It is said that a good movie is one that feels like a sensual and emotional *experience*, rather than simply a visual presentation. A brilliant movie, then, is one that is not simply a singular identifiable experience - it is a multi-dimensional layer of intertwined experiences; individual plots, ambiences and presentation styles, all masterfully combined into a tour de force of a film. THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY is one such movie, a breathtakingly accomplished combination of several potentially separate film experiences. It is at once an ornate and dazzling drama; a multifarious, intriguing and heart-wrenching romance; a reticulate and psychologically manipulating thriller; and, ultimately, an unsettlingly potent psycho-portrait of the American dream. From its characters to its composition, from its symbolism to its script, the entire film is splendidly multi-dimensional, an innovation in the art of direction. Whether it captures you, terrifies you, disgusts you, or all three, or whatever you might make of the film, there is no denying it - THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY is a unique experience, a film and a half.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

That is due not so much to the script or to the actors (indeed, I found Matt Damon not to be the best choice to play the Ripley character) but to the wealth of ideas to be found in the movie. Just two examples: Ripley, after ""becoming"" Dickie, places an antique bust of Roman Emperor Hadrian in his apartment, thus indicating the stage of coming out he has reached so far. To film on location in Venice I imagined to be impossible nowadays. But the movie proves otherwise just by using some very smart tricks, which I enjoyed seeing very much.

If you can't see the homosexual and anti-capitalist overtones throughout the movie, you're either naive or blind.It was one of the worst endings I've ever seen.  I still don't believe the movie even ended, except for the fact I've already rewound the tape and took it back to the video store.  And to think --- the DVD was skipping so bad about 2/3 of the way through that I took it back to swap it for the video so I could see the ending!  When I took the video back, I asked them if they forgot to take the ending off the DVD and put it on the video, because IT DIDN'T EXIST!Maybe Ben Affleck could have shown up and saved the movie like he does all of Damon's flicks.  It could have been ""Saving Mr. Ripley"".  I'm not telling you to avoid the movie, on the contrary, I want you to see it and you will also be left with the gaping hole the movie created where the plot, direction and ending should have been.Maybe it should have ended up in some artsy-fartsy foreign film theatre where you don't understand what the heck is going on anyway.

266,kida_fish,"DARK, AMBIGUOUS, FANTASTIC MUSIC",8,26 October 2002,"The movie is 'beautifully' ambiguous. It is beautiful, not in any metaphorical sense, but it actually looks 'good', on the surface. Everything; right from the manner in which the starting credits are shown (especially the way the movie title is presented) to stunning camera angles, from some great vantage points. The movie is set somewhere in the midst of the late 50's; so every detail has been catered to, in order to create an aura of 'those old days'. Most of the settings of the movie is based in Italy, and the visuals of the place is the stuff of heavens: the claustrophobic 'tiled' roads, the 'out -of -date' and 'uncared for' vehicles, the enchantingly blue ocean, the 'dreamy' houses with grand décor, even the corpulent 'ice - box', et al. It is the most aesthetically pleasing movie I have ever seen, or maybe I have been missing out on good - looking movies. This is as far as one of the aspects of the movie goes, and is a good reason to watch the flick. A better reason to view this motion picture, goes as follows: There is much more to this movie than meets the eye. The plot revolves around the trials and tribulations of a young, small - time con - man, Tom Ripley, who ventures into an unusual business of convincing a very rich and spoilt brat ('Dickie Greenleaf') of this humongous business magnate ('Herbert Greenleaf') to return to his father and stop being a worthless ass. The movie actually begins when Ripley goes to Italy to confront Dickie, as entrusted by Herbert Greenleaf, lured by the promise of a reward of a thousand dollars; then, a lot of things begin to happen, which make up the movie. The picture, basically, throws a light on the various facets of Ripley's persona. Ripley is presented as this very normal, lonely person. He is, however, quite talented. He plays the piano well, and has the unique ability to impersonate people, feign people's hand - writing, signature, etc.; and he uses these qualities to make a living. Lonely, insecure and lovelorn Mr. Ripley instantly finds a liking towards Dickie Greenleaf, when Greenleaf shows a brotherly affection towards him. This attraction turns sexual, and even fatal, when Ripley accidentally murders Dick. Sexually confused, yet calm, Mr. Ripley also finds affinity towards other people: Marge Sherwood, Meredith Logue, and Peter Smith-Kingsley. Muffled, he is; also he is sensitive. A moving scene at the opera succeeds in Ripley, jerking a couple of teardrops. Though he commits three murders, he does feel remorse, especially after killing Peter Smith-Kingsley, in a desperate attempt to save his skin. Also, this is the last scene of the movie, shot brilliantly, with multiple images of Ripley crying, from aptly angled mirrors, which leaves the conclusion of the movie, upto the viewer, to decide. Ripley doesn't like who he is. He uses his feigning qualities in impersonating the rich kid, Dickie, himself, which he quite well succeeds in doing so. All in all, director Anthony Minghella has done a fantastic job in successfully portraying the less pleasing human sides, by using Matt Damon as a guinea -pig. Matt, too does an impressive job in displaying the lesser characteristics of human emotions, quite effectively.The movie has a dark undercurrent and is, at times, also frightening: all this, in a very subtle sense. There is hardly any crappy 'orchestral' music at critical moments, telling the viewers, when to feel any kind of emotion, appropriate for the situation. The feel is quite stolid, adding an eerie effect to the movie. In fact, the movie has a lot of fantastic jazz music, all throughout its duration and adds its own charm to the feel of the movie.An intelligent movie, if you don't prefer a 'depressing' flick, watch it for the wonderful music and the masterful cinematography and choice of locations, and eventually, you will end up liking even the 'depression' of it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
267,kevinathome,If A Man Was A Stereotypical Woman,8,2 February 2014,"Matt Damon did a great job, as usual. It was kind of weird, based on a novel written by a woman, about how Damon's character, with no power, had to make himself interesting and compelling to a man, so that the man would then admit him to his fabulous lifestyle, though still always subject to being discarded on a day by day basis. To complete the ""what if a man had to be a stereotypical woman"" premise, Damon's character seems increasingly gay for the rich playboy. Of course it all goes horribly badly, since naturally a man in that position would turn to murder. As a man, I protest! In fact, I could never have been so clever as the protagonist. Even so, the first half of the movie is unusual, idyllic, suspenseful, with a sense of doom. The second half is Damon's character trying to pass himself off as the playboy. It's plainly doomed and insane, but he just keeps plausibly getting away with it. Lots of suspense, but less and less plausible. My wife figured they should have stopped with the first half. Is this supposed to be an allegory for a woman surviving in a man's world? Maybe so, the novel is from 1955. And of course, he has to give up on love, even betray his lover.Hmm, was somebody a little bitter?",The Talented Mr. Ripley
268,robertrosado,A powerful and disturbing thriller.,10,1 January 2005,"How far would you go to be someone else? If there was someone better looking, wealthier, cooler... what would you give to be them for one day? Actually, forget one day. What would you give to have their life? In Anthony Minghella's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", based on Patricia Highsmith's classic suspense novel, our protagonist is presented with this tantalizing opportunity, and makes the wrong choice.Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a step up from being nobody. He is a piano tuner at Princeton, and lives a shabby lifestyle. He is a mystery man, everyone sees him, yet nobody knows who he is. When wealthy businessman Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) mistakes Tom for somebody else, Tom is handed a ticket to Italy, and given a small task: To persuade Herbert's son, Dickie (Jude Law) to come back to America. When Tom meets Dickie and Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow), his beautiful fiancée, he believes that he has entered a whole new world, filled with jazz, culture, money, and everything else that Tom never had. As time goes on, that dream that Tom has longed for is threatened by Dickie's arrogant personality and hurtful affairs. As an act of self-defense (and rage), Tom brutally kills Dickie. Now, Tom is desperate to make sure that this way of living stays with him, while not getting caught.Anthony Minghella (""The English Patient"") is a filmmaker of rare quality. The films he makes are not only visually arresting, but also emotionally stimulating. His use of color and cinematography is moody, unsettling, and impeccable. Unlike many other filmmaker, his choices always work. In one haunting shot, Ripley closes the cover of a piano. As he steps away from it, his reflection splits into two, illuminating his split personality. His screenplay of Highsmith's novel is terrific. It is filled with horror, light humor, exhilarating drama, and beautifully crafted exchanges. His taut script never loses sight of morbid places it has to go, and the point it has to make. He also throws in some fascinating, sexual undertones between Dickie and Tom.In his best performance ever, Matt Damon (""Good Will Hunting"") is absolutely mesmerizing in the title role. At first, the audience sympathizes with Ripley, given his meek personality and underwhelming existence. As the film goes on, we follow Ripley through his journey, as he evades his friends, and the police. Damon's Ripley is shy, clinging, lonely, and pathetic. A sad character. Through all of the bad things that he does, and all of the lies he tells, we still have no choice but to follow him. And that is because we understand, if not agree, with his motivations.As Minghella himself once said, the most spoken word in the screenplay is ""Dickie"". It seems that, throughout the film's two and a half hour running time, all of the characters are fascinated with Dickie. It's the name on everyone's lips. Jude Law (""AI: Artificial Intelligence"") exudes self-importance, class, and undeniable sexuality. Dickie is an abusive rascal and playboy, but we can't look away from him. Gwyneth Paltrow (""Shakespeare in Love"") is brilliant as Marge, Dickie's long-suffering fiancée. Marge, like Tom, goes through a long and damaging journey. When she realizes that Dickie is missing, Marge is not sure exactly what to think. She likes Tom, so she doesn't really suspect him. Throughout the film, her thoughts shift back and forth, until she comes to a startling conclusion. In one heartbreaking moment, Marge approaches the door of Tom's apartment. She thinks that Dickie is in there, and she says: ""Whatever it is you've done, you've broken my heart. That's one thing I know you're guilty of."" It is a wonderful performance, one that was ignored by virtually every awards group.Cate Blanchett (""Elizabeth"") lights up her brief screen time as Meredith Logue, a spirited debutant. While Meredith does love Tom (actually, she is under the impression that Tom is Dickie), it never occurs to her that she is only a cog in Tom's little game. Finally, Philip Seymour Hoffman (""Magnolia"") is appropriately slimy as Freddie Miles, Dickie's best friend. Freddie might be a bit of a bastard, but he is one of the more honest characters in the film. Freddie knows that something has happened to his friend, and he's not going to stop until he finds out what.In a scene with Peter Smith-Kinglsey (Jack Davenport), a concert pianist and friend of Marge, Tom says: ""I've always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody, than a real nobody"". This is what the film is all about, and this is what the audience must decide on. The eerie and atmospheric score is provided by Gabriel Yared, the arresting cinematography by John Seale (practically a dreamy showcase for Italy), and the smooth editing by Walter Murch. These elements, combined with a stellar cast and Minghella's talent, form a masterpiece. This is a powerful and disturbing thriller, one that I will not soon forget.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

270,doctor_dolittle,A Classic Suspense Masterpiece,10,4 August 2000,"I'm convinced that when you watch this movie you either going to absolutely love it or truly despise it. The Talented Mr. Ripley opens to a group of black lines running up and down the screen, much like the beginning of Psycho, and continues on the same level as the classic all the way throughout the film. Matt Damon gives a chilling performance as Tom Ripley, a 1950's sociopath with a love for the piano. While borrowing a Princeton jacket from someone to tickle the ivories, Tom runs into Mr. Greenleaf who mistakes Tom for a Princeton graduate, therefore associating him with his playboy son, Dickie, played perfectly by Jude Law. Mr. Greenleaf offers Tom $1,000 to go to Italy and bring back his spoiled brat. Being nothing but a poor boy, Tom does not correct the man on his assumption and gladly takes the trip and money. While in Italy, Tom meets up with Dickie and his betrothed Margie, Gwyneth Paltrow, convincing them, as he had done with Mr. Greenleaf, that he knew Dickie from college. Dickie and Tom strike up an instant friendship, and perhaps more, making each the brother the other never had. As the story progresses, it does not turn into a typical slash and gash flick, but a slower-paced, tense psychological thriller, putting you directly into the mind of a truly disturbed man, and in doing so, making you actually root for the bad guy. Tom Ripley is the obvious villain, but you just cannot help but like him. Making Tom so enjoyable is his complexity, and the disgust you feel for the other characters. Tom is confused man with motives that do not depend on revenge or hatred, but love. When Tom meets his socialite companions, he believes they actually care him. Margie puts out an `I'll be your best friend' demeanor while Dickie confuses Tom, who is already flustered by his sexuality, into believing he loves him. Dickie is a spoiled, rude, angry, adulterer, his girlfriend is an overbearing back-stabber, his best friend, is almost as bad as Dickie himself, and then there's Meredith, another pampered, egocentric rich girl. With a group of `innocent' victims like this, it is no wonder that Tom becomes the most amicable. Anthony Minghella combines lush landscape, spine-tingling music, and deliberate pacing to create a chilling classic. True-to-life characters, exotic locations, a conceivable story, and the surprise of homosexual overtones, we are given a film that will, no doubt, go down in cinematic history as a landmark masterpiece. Every performance is right on the money. Matt Damon has that boy-next-door look that really scares you into thinking that anyone could be a psychotic murderer. Where many actors would overdo Ripley by giving him evil grins or wide eyes around every corner, Matt Damon underplays this and makes Tom frighteningly realistic. Along with him, the supporting actors are excellent. Jude Law manages to pull off an American accent to perfection and turns Dickie Greenleaf from a self-centered rich boy into a hated bastard. Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchet are also wonderful in their contrasting female leads, Philip Seymour Hoffman pulls off another great performance as Freddie, Dickie's counter spoiled-brat, and Jack Davenport is incredible as Peter, the only character that is actually ultimately good-natured. Sensational direction, superb casting, and a tight-locked script make The Talented Mr. Ripley one of the 10 Best films of the year. A+! A chilling good time!",The Talented Mr. Ripley

After seeing this movie it is very obvious to me why one one of the characters in the movie was nominated for an academy award! Jude's preformance was impecable. Not only was he able to catch the beauty and charm of Dickie Greenleaf, but also the repulsive vanity and selfishness of the character. Not many other actors, if any, would be able to accomplish something like this. To see the true depth of this character one need only ask himself two questions: 1) Did you hate Dickie Greenleaf? 2)Did you love Dickie Greenleaf? The answer to both of these questions is ""Yes"". This is how multidemensional the character was. All I can say is Jude, Jude, Jude. If you love him (like myself) see this movie. If you don't love him.....you will.My favourite quotes: (Marge) ""It's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, and then he forgets you and it's very very cold."" (Freddie)""Dont you just want to f- them all just once?""        (Dickie) ""Just once?""",The Talented Mr. Ripley
272,FreddieLee04,Damon dominates this strong Minghella movie.,7,3 July 2021,"Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp, even his co-star in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley', Jude Law, all have seem to have suffered from the same audience-inflicted disease as Matt Damon. The diagnosis? They gather acclaim more on their ""good looks"" than their actual on-screen performances. This can lead to some (like Brad Pitt) becoming criminally undervalued actors especially when it comes to awards seasons. The group- that includes Damon- are overlooked and disregarded time after time, and I feel he was simply ignored for his turn as Tom Ripley.We begin the film knowing that Ripley is a smart man. He constantly decieves every person he comes across, applying his fake demeanor and faux grin, a feat which is first seen as he approaches the young Dickie Greenleaf and Dickie's girlfriend, Marge whilst on a beach in sunny Italy. Ripley reminds Dickie how they were both students at Princeton University in New Jersey, and although his memory isn't jogged, Greenleaf allows Ripley to tag along with him as he enjoys himself in Southern Europe.My memory, however, was certainly jogged around 40 minutes into this movie as I realised the range and capability of the lead man here. In just two years, Matt Damon had gone from his relatable Will Hunting to the absolute opposite in Tom Ripley. Feats like this are rare even for some of the best actors. Even the greats like Nicholson, Duvall or Hackman would struggle to navigate their way between the character spectrum- they either stick with the 'madman' character, or the 'down-to-earth' good-guy. To have not even been recognised with an Oscar nomination for his work here, Matt Damon should feel absolutely robbed.Throughout the 2hr19m runtime, I found myself so unbelievable fascinated by the portrayal of Ripley and the character himself, Minghella's movie almost took a backseat, thus making the film a victim of its own success. Had the other characters not felt like they were simply there to put an obsticle in Mr. Ripley's way then maybe they'd have posed a more interesting dynamic on-screen, and certainly would have kept the film rolling.This is superb insight into the mind of a narcissist. If only the rest of the picture could keep up with Damon's intense, captivating and career-best performance. Worthy of a watch.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
273,ah`Pook,"By the time you read this, I will be dead.",2,21 August 2000,"Sorry for so dramatically getting your attention, but I really feel I need to warn as many people as possible. This film is a shocking, diabolical waste of celluloid. The Stultifying Boring Complicated Bland Over-rated Muddled Contrived Endless Interminable Patronizing Obvious Unrewarding Misguided Insensitive Shallow Dispassionate Untalented Mr. Ripley is as bloated as its original title.  While it could be argued that the twists and turns in the plot keep the viewer guessing, it could also be argued that one has to care about what happens in order to guess. And who could care about this collection of spoiled brats portrayed by spoiled brats, playing out their two-dimensional roles of the idle rich and beautiful in 1950's Italy? The only character who doesn't fit into this mould is the pointless Mr. Ripley himself, unconvincingly phoned in by flavour of the moment Matt Damon. Thoroughly revolting from start to long, overwrought finish. It appears the film-makers did not know how to end this travesty, and therefore filmed 6 different endings, each 10 to 15 minutes long, and ran them one after the other. How anyone could care how this stupidity resolved itself by the last two reels is beyond me. A telling credit is that the film was 'edited' (did he actually cut anything or just piece together everything Minghella shot?) by Walter Murch. Murch is a genius with sound, and should have played the strengths he showed designing sound for Coppola and Lucas instead of reinventing himself as a mediocre film editor.I rated this film 2 out of 10... a point each for the performances by Jude Law and Philip Seymour Hoffman, the only cast members who seem to understand that they are portraying human swine. If you like impenetrable, meaningless, unredeemable snoozefests about rich honkies in Italy, but Paul Schrader's ""The Comfort of Strangers"" didn't quite scratch that itch, you may consider watching it. If you enjoyed Minghella's other rubbish, ""The English Patient"" and ""Truly Madly Deeply"", or if you want to gawk at the pretty studs, perhaps you can gleam an inch of enjoyment out of this nonsense.Otherwise, heed my warning: Life is too precious, brief, and fleeting to squander 133 minutes of it on The Talented Mr. Ripley.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
274,johnprestonevans,So Much Talent,9,27 December 2001,"The Talented Mr. Ripley is a splendid showcase of young actors in a richly dark story of obsession, murder and talent.  Director Anthony Mingela dives deep into the disturbed phsyche of Tom Ripley and fleshes out a dreamy 1960's Italian landscape in this twisting tale.  Matt Damon plays Ripley, who seemingly starts off as an innocent outsider, with an everyday lower class life in the big city.  By chance, he meets a wealthy American industrialist who mistakes him for a wealthy prep school graduate and friend of his elusive playboy son Dickie.  Ripley is sent on a mission to bring Dickie back from his lazy, party-all-the-time subsidized lifestyle in Italy. Jude Law is brilliant as Dickie - a spoiled ray of sunshine who carelessly spends his father's money on boats, seaside vista homes and expensive Italian clothes.  His charm and charisma quickely attract the friendship of men - including Ripley, and the desire of women.  His cheerful and ignorant girlfriend Marge is wonderfully played by Gweneth Paltrow.  Ripley begins to obsess over Dickie and his apparently perfect life.  By its title's suggestion, Mr. Tom Ripley is very talented, and begins to use his forgery and impersonating skills to slowly become Dickie Greenleaf.  The film becomes noticably darker in its second half when Ripley assumes Dickie's identity.  Murder and deceit spiral out of control until a shocking and unfinished ending will leave you feeling empty and wanting more.  This is a great film with a not-so-hollywood conclusion.  Final rating 8.5/10",The Talented Mr. Ripley
275,Cubfan-2,"Well done, but",7,26 December 1999,"This is a well-crafted thriller with a marvelous performance by Matt Damon. But I've figured something out about Anthony Minghella's directing style. I didn't care for his ""English Patient"" because I thought the novel was an unfilmable book (which I loved) and that he hadn't pulled it off. But though I liked ""Ripley"" much more, it still didn't spark with me, and I think it's because I find Minghella's approach too detached, even cold, for my taste. The passion was missing her for me, even as I could appreciate the acting and the scenery. Most may not agree with me, but that's just how I feel.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Originally pitched to Alfred Hitchcock, it contains a lot of the elements of suspense and ""psychosis"" that marked Hitchcock's movies. This movie ventures where even Hitchcock wouldn't have dared. The main character, Tom Ripley, is a psychological chameleon.  He has no esteem, and no sense of his own identity, and must 'absorb' the identity of those around him. The viewer will find his/herself rooted to the seat waiting to find out what psychotic behavior Tom Ripley will display next.  A number of good nail-biting suspense scenes also liven up the show, as well as the magnificent cinematography that makes Italy look as good as it ever has in a movie.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
277,Dr. Don-2,Now THIS is an excellent film. Should garner 6 Oscar nominations but probably won't.,10,27 December 1999,"First of all -- arrrggghhh!  Please look up the words ""sociopath"" and ""psychopath"" before using them in reviews of this film.  ""Pulp Fiction"" was full of the former, and Hannibal Lecter is the best example of the latter ever portrayed on film.  Thank you.Minghella, who created a truly remarkable and excellent film last time around, adapting an even better novel by Ondaatje (""The English Patient"", of course), this time has bettered the novelist (Patricia Highsmith), IMHO, with an engaging story worth telling and exceedingly well told.  Matt Damon's portrayal of Tom Ripley fulfills the promise his earlier performances made but never quite materialised.  This is no psychopath nor a sociopath (cf., the scene in the drifting boat with him and the body in repose; the tear in the opera scene; his ""basement room"" that no one can enter but in which he wanders alone and afraid, wanting to give someone the key so they can enter), but a complex, credible human being led astray by greed, envy, jealousy, infatuation and chance opportunity.  Oh, talented indeed, Mr. Ripley, and not the first fine film character whose talents bring him and others to tragic ends.  In the novel(s) Mr. Ripley is more two-dimensional and more indeed psychopathic, in the colloquial sense at least.  Here his character is more rich and hence, to me, both more chilling and more sympathetic.Jude Law's portrayal of Dickie was also superb.  I had less sympathy for this spoiled and arrogant cold fish than for his nemesis -- and that speaks to how well Law played the part -- nuances of speech, gesture and inflection which came not only, I'm sure, from fine writing and directing, but from his own feel for the role and ability to express it.Gwyneth Paltrow was given a much more developed role here than in ""Shakespeare in Love"" and handled it deftly and convincingly. Cate Blanchett in her smaller role was able to convey both the repellent character of the spoiled rich, beneath the veneer of culture, and at the same time the ordinary human need for connection, attention and affection which makes even the idle rich human after all.Smaller roles by Philip Hoffman (who plays creepy but very sharp  chacters very well:  ""Boogie Nights"", ""Happiness"") as Dickie's well, sort of friend; Jack Davenport as Peter (just the scene when he and Tom first collide in the opera house -- when everything was communicated in a couple of glances and gestures -- was enough for kudos) and Sergio Rubini as Inspector Riverini all contributed to the overall acting excellence.Add to this the breathtaking scenery and cinematography and the diverse musical score (jazz, opera, symphonic) and intelligent script writing and it's a thoroughly fine film.The crafting of the last scene on the cruise ship exemplifies the very pleasing attentiveness to detail in this film.I'd nominate Minghella for director and screenplay adaptation, Damon for actor, Law for supporting actor, John Seale for cinematography, Walter Murch for editing.  Costumes and art direction were very well done.I would not give this film all these awards -- there's ""Besieged"", ""American Beauty"", ""The Fight Club"" (yup, that's right), ""Bringing Out the Dead"" and ""The Insider"" to consider (and no NOT the manipulative and simple-minded ""The Green Mile"").  All in all a great year for films after last year, when ""The Thin Red Line"" was way ahead of the rest, leaving ""Gods and Monsters"", ""Celebration"" and ""Central Station"" to vie for second best.IMHO, that is.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Meet Joe Black was great for me, I enjoyed a sit through of Eyes Wide Shut, but this movie is an example of why some books should never be made into movies.  The first hour was great.  I was intrigued with the jazz-filled locales and mysterious characters.  Then I was shocked at how the movie dumps the most interesting character, eliminates the jazz and stoops to a boring game of imitate and evade.  Matt Damon has his moments, but they're wasted on account that there is really no way to get into Ripley's mind.  Words would describe the scenes way better than any stares by Damon.  Also, the other characters seem to be there just make Ripley paranoid.  Really, was Paltrow there just to blow the whistle for Ripley's impersonation of Dickie?  Only Jude Law's great performance keeps this from being a movie of boring people walking around.  Oh well, some points for the beautiful shots of Venice.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

283,zza99tmk,"Impressive visuals and good acting, yet a lack of suspense",5,28 February 2000,"After having seen ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" last Friday I really had some problems how to value this movie. It certainly is a stylish work thanks to the cinematography, the italian location and the wonderful jazz soundtrack. Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Baker Hall gave some good performances, but the ones who amazed me most were Jude Law as Dickie and particularly Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddie: Hoffman was already superb in Todd Solondz' much overrated ""Happiness"" and if I had to pick a single scene to show you how brilliant this man was it would be the one in Dickies apartment, when Freddie senses that something is wrong. Absolutely marvellous! (I look forward to see Hoffman in Andersons ""Magnolia"") And yet, despite of these qualities, I felt disappointed by the film. Gwyneth Paltrow was the only in the cast whom I rather found weak, though to be fair, there wasn't actually much to do for her. For a thriller ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" lacks too much of suspense. Yes, there are some thrilling scenes but as a whole I wasn't that excited. I would say that this film rather works as a drama, but not as a thriller. Having said that, are the comparisons to Hitchcoks works really inapproriate. Minghella succeeds in telling us about Ripleys loneliness and his search for love and affection and doing so without making any concessions to mainstream audiences demonstrates his understatement. Though ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" didn't live up to my expectations, I still regard Anthony Minghella as one of the most interesting filmmakers of today and it'll be exciting to wonder where he's going to next.verdict: mediocre",The Talented Mr. Ripley
284,janesbit1,Hitchcockian thriller is one of 1999's best!,10,30 January 2000,"Alfred Hitchcock often unbalances us by presenting ordinary people in extraordinary situations and by blurring the lines between good and evil. Anthony Minghella has done much the same here in his film translation of Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley.  From the opening credits we are thrust inside Tom Ripley's thoughts with a sense of foreboding as he wishes that it all could be erased, including himself. Matt Damon nails the Ripley role perfectly in 1999's most complex role. Damon plays Ripley as a likable, introverted young man who is adept at imitating others and playing a variety of roles.  When a shipping tycoon thinks that Ripley knows his son from the 1956 Princeton class, he convinces him to travel to Italy to convince his son Dickie to return to New York. Ripley goes, and falls in love with Italy and the leisurely lifestyle that Dickie (Jude Law) and girlfriend Marge (Gweneth Paltrow) enjoy.  He also falls in love with Dickie.  Ripley is having the time of his life, but Dickie grows tired of Tom and the plot grows very dark. Ripley makes full use of his chameleon-like talents during this time. After all ""I'd rather be a fake somebody than a real nobody.""   Minghella has done masterful work here.  The scenery evokes the  mood of La Dolce Vita in the 1950's, the film composition and editing are very tight and effectively done, and he has drawn outstanding performances from Damon and the supporting cast. This film is not for everyone.  Like Hitchcock, Minghella takes you on a filmic roller coaster ride from lightness and humor to darkness and brooding.  Though nothing is explicit, the homoeroticism itself may turn off some movie patrons.  Others will feel manipulated, as you are drawn very deeply into Ripley's character, and this is a very uncomfortable place to be--figuratively in the basement of the soul. The Talented Mr. Ripley is a disturbing movie that will linger in your mind long after the final reel has ended.  You will likely find that it will take a second viewing to catch the layered meanings and subtleties that Minghella has crafted within the film.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Many reviewers have mentioned Jude Law as the ""star"" of the show, and he was excellent.  However, to me, Matt Damon's portrayal carried the movie.  His expressions during moments of reflection were wonderful.  He really seemed to live this character, which helped me through some of the sillier plot points.  I had received many mixed reviews about this film, so I will admit, my expectations weren't that high.  It is a little on the long side, and some of the scenes near the end are almost laughably unbelievable. (The fault of the novel, I think). But overall, I found it very watchable.

Matt Damon gives a performance worthy of winning an Oscar the fact that he didn't even manage a nomination was wrong. He is in every frame of the film playing Tom Ripley without a shred of ego, totally transforming himself.
Tom is a man stuck in a trap of his own making. Someone in love with and seeking approval from his Dickie, who nevertheless ends up killing him and stealing his identity.Obviously Tom does some fairly despicable things so the fact that Damon is able to make Tom's thought processes rational no matter how bizzarre they are and keeps the film together should have been noticedJude Law  is good too since he plays Dickie with a shallowness that is human and not over the top. This film also exposed me to what a good actress Gwyneth Paltrow is I was never overly impressed with her beforehand but the scene near the end where she attacks Tom slowly letting all the rage she has felt at knowing the man who killed her fiance will go free just explode is very impressive.However the main man is Damon and the delicacy of his acting and the consistency of his characterisation made me understand that what happens at the end wasn't such a shock. Basically in killing Peter, Tom is just reacting in the only way he knows how, the Dickie murder showed how limited his capabilities are for dealing with stress.

As time passes, Dickie becomes less and less enamored with Tom, and the two have an argument, which ends with Tom killing Dickie, on a boat, in the middle of the ocean. Tom covers his tracks as best as he can, and begins posing as Dickie, using his passport, clothes, and financial means to better himself. Dickie's long time friend, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who Tom had met while Dickie was still alive, begins to poke around into Dickie's disappearance, but things get too hot for Tom, and he also kills Freddie.Tom pens a suicide note, after studying Dickie's handwriting for sometime, and addresses it to himself, leaving it in Dickie's apartment, which the police later find, and read. No one is convinced that Dickie killed himself, and his Father even goes so far as to hire a private detective to investigate the matters, but he clears Tom later.During Dickie's 'disappearance,' Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport), Dickie and Marge's friend comes to stay with Marge while this is going on. He's eventually introduced to Tom, and the two hit it off, becoming fast friends, as no one suspects Tom. Eventually, Tom and Peter leave together (this is a few weeks later, after no culprit for Freddie and Dickie's murder has been found), on a boat, where he later kills Peter.I found this film quite engrossing.

The great performances here are Cate Blanchett's and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann's. Matt Damon looks great and he isn't too bad, but he lacks mystery. The movie is too sympathetic to his character, which is a pity.

And Anthony Minghella has done that, and some.Every single member of the cast puts in an outstanding  performance making everyone of their characters 3 dimensional.Matt Damon - So aware of the subtleties which show up on screen. To produce them in a performance such as this requires more skill & co-ordination than a surgeon.Jude Law - What a knockout!? He captures the self-confidence that only money & privilege can bring SO perfectly.Gwyneth Paltrow - She has set new standards for the portrayal of the kaleidoscope of emotions Marge feels. Cate Blanchett - When Meredith Logue appears the audience is forced to consider the situation from the points of view of all the characters on the screen. ""Will Tom Ripley get found out?"". Unfortunately this means that for the first few lines of dialogue the audience's attention is not fully on Cate. In spite of this Cate manages to capture both the innocence and longing found in the character and at the same time pull the audience back into reality. Not an easy job, but one she carries off wonderfully.Philip Seymour Hoffman - Oh my god! Is this guy going to be bigger than Nicholson or what? He has hardly any lines and those are so abrasive that a lesser actor would not have made it believable for Freddie to get away with them, but Hoffman lights up the screen and, as Jude Law, drags a concrete and albeit rare character from the world of reality and puts him on screen for us to enjoy. Tremendous.Jack Davenport - With all the above going on it could be overwhelming for a reasonable and rational character to enter the fray. You've seen horror films where the good guy goes to see what that noise was coming from the attic and then promptly gets bumped off? Totally unbelievable huh? Well Peter Smith-Kingsley could have come across in the same way. Davenport however manages to make it totally logical that he'd get to know and trust Ripley and thereby act as the catalyst to his final transformation into a person who acts in cold blood.Add to this the music, photography, locations, directing and editing (you can tell from the trailers & making-ofs that there was stacks left out) this film has catapulted into my top 5 favorites of all time.This film has come just at the right time.

Reluctant and perhaps too embarrassed to deny ownership of the jacket, Tom pretends to know of Greenleaf junior, probably expecting never to cross paths with the man again. However, Mr Greenleaf has other ideas - tired of his son Dickie's (Jude Law), playboy life where he squanders his generous allowance in Italy with girlfriend Marge (played by Gwynneth Paltrow), practically throws $1,000 at Tom to travel there to bring his errant son home.Spoilers: Barely having a chance to refuse the forthright offer. Tom soon finds himself travelling first-class to Europe on a Cunard liner having first educated himself in a crash course of jazz in order to mirror Dickie's own interests in music. However, Tom inadvertently makes an unwise error when he is approached by a rich heiress from the textile industry upon disembarkation in the form of Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchette). Enjoying the illusion of being a First Class passenger he introduces himself as the man he seeks to bring home, again not expecting to cross paths with the mystery admirer again. He thought wrong and so ensues a cloak and dagger plot of maintaining a fake acquaintance with Dickie & Marge and evading Meredith who reappears at certain tense moments in Italy - moments a little too much of a close call.Dickie's recollections of Princeton are decidedly hazy so he takes Tom Ripley at his word when he first enthusiastically approaches him and Marge languishing on an Italian beach and enthusing about the rare coincidence. Marge invites him for lunch and soon Tom begins to covet Dickie's lifestyle and will manipulate the situation in any way he can in order to maintain and prolong their friendship - even after Dickie outgrows Tom and dismisses him as both a leech and a bore.The movie is bursting at the scenes with tense anticipation and yet we as viewers find Dickie (although every inch the charming playboy), a leech upon his father and we route for Tom as somewhat of an impoverished, socially awkward underachiever. He has an almost childlike innocence at times yet he can think adequately on his feet when being forced into corners. He is both to be pitied and yet admired as he manipulates whilst managing to look like a hapless amateur that you want to love and protect. It's one movie where for a long time afterwards you wonder what can possibly be in store for his future long after the credits roll.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
293,tbeard,One of 99's Best,10,31 December 1999,"The films this holiday season have been quite a mixed bag, but one shines far above the rest. The Talented Mr. Ripley, the first effort of Anthony Minghella since The English Patient, is set in the backdrop of gorgeous southern Italy. It tells the tale of a young man, Tom Ripley, who goes to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf, an expatriate son of a wealthy shipping merchant. While in Italy, Tom falls in love with la dolce vita that he is all around him but at the same time so far out of his reach. Brilliant direction and an all star cast truly allow Ripley to shine in what is one of this year's best. The character of Tom Ripley is one of the most complex in recent film history, and Matt Damon delivers a flawless performance. When first meeting Dickie, played by Jude Law, Tom is utterly smitten with the lifestyle that Dickie and his girlfriend Marge, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, live in. Minghella does a terrific job of portraying this fascination that will eventually lead to obsession and even murder. Minghella does not conform to the cookie cutter format of having Tom fall for Marge and simply try to take Dickie's place. Instead, in an ingenious move, Tom's love for Dickie's lifestyle is played off with homosexual undertones. Damon does a great job in admirably taking on a role that could potentially shatter his golden boy image.  Not only does this put an interesting twist on what otherwise could be a great bore, but it also heightens the depth of the character of Marge. Gwyneth Paltrow gives yet another stellar performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley. Her character, Marge, finds herself perplexed by men yet gaining increasing understanding as the film progresses. This allowed for tremendous character development where there would have been room for little. Her entire world revolves around Dickie, so when he disappears she is not simply losing a boyfriend, but her whole world vaporizes. She sees through Tom's lies in her desperation when few others can; yet, her attempts to point him out are ignored. Though the character of Dickie is only in slightly more than the first half of the film, Jude Law is terrific in the role that is sure to thrust him from the Hollywood peripherals and into the industry limelight. Also making a mark with her very small, but still quite amazing role, is Cate Blanchett. An incredible director puts this all star cast to good use. Minghella does great justice to the Patricia Highsmith novel on which The Talented Mr. Ripley is based. He goes further away from the cliched format of a mystery film by letting the bad guy get away-almost. There is a certain insecurity in Tom Ripley, insecurity with who is that drives him to lie and murder. It is a feeling that, deep down, is felt by everyone. Therefore, Minghella, in a way, allows the audience to find themselves rooting for a sociopath. He expresses Tom's pain in a subtle and beautiful manner. When asked by Meredith (Cate Blanchett) if he was with anyone on the boat, he simply replies ""No, I'm alone,"" a desperate cry for help that he knows will not be heard. The film ends. Tom Ripley not only gets away with the several crimes he has committed, but also with a handsome amount of money. However, he is left to pay the ultimate price. He had finally found someone to love him for who he actually way, not who he wanted to be. He had finally acquired all he had ever wanted, but in the process created his own personal hell with the web of lies and deceit he had used to get him there. It is the tragedy of the situation that drives him to destroy the only thing he truly loves. It is hard to go wrong with an all star cast that is directed by the talented Mr. Minghella, yet they take it to the next level. Every person does their part in what ends up to be a hauntingly brilliant view of the darker side of the human psyche.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
294,tbeard,One of this Year's Best,10,2 January 2000,"The films this holiday season have been quite a mixed bag, but one shines far above the rest. The Talented Mr. Ripley, the first effort of Anthony Minghella since The English Patient, is set in the backdrop of gorgeous southern Italy. It tells the tale of a young man, Tom Ripley, who goes to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf, an expatriate son of a wealthy shipping merchant. While in Italy, Tom falls in love with la dolce vita that is all around him but at the same time so far out of his reach. Brilliant direction and an all star cast truly allow Ripley to shine in what is one of this year's best.

Still, if you have the patience to sit through it, you'd find out that it is a very solid movie. If you hate this movie purely because of its length or the mild homosexual suggestions then you should stay home and watch Pokemon on TV next time. The acting was superb, the directing was extraordinary and the scenery was breathtaking at times. Even though I'm not a fan of Matt Damon, I have to admit he's very good in this movie. Also, I like the ending very much and I think it fits the tone and the story line of the movie perfectly.

The picture should have ended when Ripley beats the desiccated brains out of the haughty playboy.

Jude Law and Matt Damon in one film, an intelligent subject matter, and lush scenes in Italy.  And who cares if Paltrow is in it?  Not even she can drag it down, right?Right.  Absolutely, positively correct.  I have never been so captivated by a film in the opening scene, and I have never watched a film all the way through without my mind wondering once, until this.  It was all dealt with perfectly, the cinematography was beautiful, the acting outstanding (Even Paltrow wasn't that bad) and the story-line faultless.  Jude Law, absolutely gorgeous, was the highlight of the film, but Matt Damon still managed to carry the title role off with ease.  What was so interesting about his character was, by the end we were praying with all our heart that he wouldn't get caught.  He might have been a villain, but he was an extremely likeable one.However, I have knocked points off because of the ending.  It was too abrubt, too univited.  I for one wanted more, even if it was some kind of assurance that Ripley was heading for something better.  That said, the ending did leave a lasting impression on me that's hard to describe; when he was crying I really felt his pain.  After all, all of us have felt like an outsider many times in our life, haven't we?",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Jude Law on the other hand, was actually the best actor in the movie. He surpassed them all and overshadowed Damon by a mile.

I always like something that keeps me on my toes, trying to stay ahead of, or at least up with the characters. However, watching The Talented Mr. Ripley, I was entirely uninterested. I felt absolutely no connection to any of the characters, regardless of the actor's performances. I thought that Paltrow did a good job of filling her seemingly pointless role, but that was it. Jude Law had an interesting character, but played it into oblivion. After about five minutes, I felt totally disinterested in his antics. Damon did nothing to make me like the title character, he seemed whiny and idiotic. The plot IDEA was brilliant, but poorly executed. I was confused by Damon's alleged similarity to Law's character. Apparently all he had to do to look like Law was take off his glasses. It's surprising someone didn't notice it earlier. Maybe in 20 years or so, someone will make this movie again, because it has real potential. However, this version is NOT worth your time.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Now, character study movies can be fascinating. So can 3 hr epics. The English Patient was a world-class masterpiece, Mr. Ripley is convuluted.Matt Damon does a great job as Tom, and so do all the other actors, most notably, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Every scene that he is in is just a pleasure to watch.Minghella's direction is great, although at times, it can get a little distracting.Mr. Ripley has something meaningful to say, and is always trying to say a hundred different things, but can't quite get it out.

But I confess that once was enough for me on this one -- it made me too uncomfortable to contemplate a second time.  Of course, this is probably a testimonial  to how good a movie it is, and I'll throw in the towel and concede the point--[there may be a child in my neighborhood who is exceptionally fine at pulling the wings off of living butterflies] -- but I don't ever want to watch it, and I don't want to see this movie ever again.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

There's great directing (Brian DePalma or John Woo), there's OK directing (most movies), but this is the only time I've seen BAD directing.  This movie was horrible. There's no way around it.  For example, if you happen to miss the first line of the movie, then the rest of the movie will not make any sense at all.  Speaking of that, I think that if you start a movie with narration, you should continue the narration throughout the movie, not just stop.  I never quite understood any of Mr. Ripley's motives, nor did I see why he killed so many people.  Maybe I'm not looking deep enough, but I don't really think that I have any want to.

Gwenyth Paltrow also fits perfectly as Jude Law's character's girlfriend who doesn't suspect much of her boyfriend's carefree life style as he is sewing his wild oats behind her back.Having been in Italy for some time in the past, this film brings me sheer joy of beautiful sceneries I remember seeing before.  The score is also excellent.  I wasn't even a jazz fan prior to seeing this movie.  But I liked all the tunes played in this marvelous film.  As a matter of fact, this movie introduced me to jazz music, which has gotten into my liking.I must have seen this movie over and over again within short span of time period, and I can't say that about many movies.  Many people criticize for its ambiguous ending, but must all ""good"" movies have happy ending?  No, the real world isn't always happy, and having an ending like this movie's opens discussion among viewers with their interpretation.  Truly a remarkable film.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
309,InfoBabe,Everything to love in a film,10,6 July 2004,"*****Spoilers!!****Ripley is a sociopath unlike what another poster said.  He has no real remorse and just keeps on killing to continue the life style he stole from Dickie.  And though I am not a fan of Paltrow, I think she was the best actor in the movie.  First she was the sunny, pleasing, not too deep girlfriend, but in the end she was the only one who saw through Ripley.  She knew it and he knew it.  He would have killed her too but was interupted. Freddy knew too but did not survive Ripley's greed.  He even killed his new boyfriend because of complications of meeting up with those who thought Ripley was Greenleaf.  Ripley was a hangers on like we have all run into in our lives; a mooch as Dickie says.  Wealthy persons have radar and it is why they hang out only with others like themselves.This certainly is one of my all time favorites and I even bought the DVD so I can watch it again and again when the mood strikes me.  Extras on the DVD are great too.  I saw Purple Noon again a couple of days ago and I think it pales in comparison to the Damon/Law version.  The latest is so rich in plot, character and mood of 1950s Italy.Ripley's Game could have been so much better with the ""Talented"" director.

He made Damon play that creepy Ripley chap so convincingly, his craving so strongly portrayed, I could hardly believe it, remembering Damon's disastrous performance as the Good Will Hunting.  He managed to make Paltrow look just a little bit overdone, which is a remarkable achievement.  Much has been made of Jude Law's performance (oscar included), and though I really failed to see anything noteworthy, he was alright. Hoffman is brilliant as Freddy. Italian footage is spectacular. Camera is excellent.Yet... half an hour before the end I hated the film so intensely, I was almost surprised to find myself hating it even more in the 30 minutes that followed.  Why? It is abominably slow.  And all the passion is spent on painting the psychological background for the murder in the first part of the film, and none is left even to try to make it convincing or just plain logical. Halfway into the movie you become absolutely sure that Ripley will kill Dickie, yet when he finally does it, you can't believe it.

Most important, though, is the insight it provides into a complex, but human character.  It's difficult not to think about Columbine High School and the pent-up rage that exploded there.  Tom Ripley is not Everyman in his actions, but he is the possessor of an identity problem, a condition prevalent in our society.  What other reason for a ""Fight Club""? Most repress it, even deny it, but it is the responsibility of the artist (author, film-maker etc.) to exaggerate it for our edification. Everyone I have spoken to was rooting for Tom Ripley as they viewed the film, no doubt because they could identify in part with his feeling of being a nobody.  I suspect that the viewers most uncomfortable with the film were in strong denial of their own feelings of inadequacy in our ""other-directed"" society.  I believe that ""The Lonely Crowd,"" by David Riesman was written in the '50's.  An interesting coincidence?  I find the comment that the film had no message intriguing.

Not really a Matt Damon fan, I am now a convert after this excellent performance (definitely tops the mediocre one in Good Will Hunting). I squirmed as Tom Ripley faces discovery over and over again and I appreciate the fact that Ripley is not portrayed as a mastermind who can get away with it at all costs, but rather a troubled man with a conscience and a desire to be loved.I definitely recommend this film to the holiday moviegoer.

318,abettertomorrow,"Brilliant, Underrated",10,25 March 2000,"The Talented Mr. Ripley is the most underrated film of the year. It's a shame it was shut out of the major categories in the Academy Awards. Every aspect of the film is masterpiece level. Of these aspects, the acting may be the finest. Matt Damon heads a flawless ensemble performance with a subtle, disturbing and also not to mention extremely risky performance. His impersonations are downright scary and his boyish looks combined with the twisted mind of Ripley helps create a ""something isn't right"" feeling in the pit of our stomachs. Oscar-nominated Jude Law steals every scene with his attractive appearance and golden charisma which reminds of Cary Grant and Robert Redford. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't perfect but does a good, realistic job breaking down as she becomes more and more suspicious of Ripley. Cate Blanchett is somewhat underused but still does a credible job of acting while maintaining an American accent. And Phillip Seymour Hoffman creates a much-needed downright hateful character in the film.Anthony Minghella is more and more convincing me he is his generation's Francis Ford Coppola. His long, slow scenes and shots and slow, tension-building style of directing in this film is comparable to The Godfather Trilogy. The script's story stays close to the book's, but wisely changes the character's behaviour and tones down the homosexuality of Ripley to rid any unnecessary subplots or doubt of credibility.In the technical department, Gabriel Yared's brooding score still lingers in my mind and deserves the Academy Award, while the cinematography and art direction is exquisite.If you haven't seen the film, do so, but be warned of some shocking behaviour.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
319,Greg Lord,Could Hitchcock have done it any better?,8,17 April 2000,"For those who like tense psychological dramas I can thoroughly recommend this film, for my money one of the best films of the year.Directed by Brit. Anthony Minghella ('The English Patient', 'Truly, Madly, Deeply'), & based on the book by Patricia Highsmith (who also wrote Strangers on a Train', which became a Hitchcock classic), it has a great cast: Matt Damon in the title role, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow & Cate Blanchett.Tom Ripley is a clever nobody with a talent' for mimicry & deceit. He manages to con a rich industrialist into sending him to sunny Italy to find his son Dickie (Jude Law), who's busy living it up on Daddy's inheritance, & bring him back to America.Rich carefree playboy Dickie is everything shy awkward Ripley is not; Ripley not only wants to be LIKE Dickie, he wants to BE Dickie. The way he goes about trying to achieve this is gripping from start to finish, & I won't give the plot away by going into any more detail!Suffice to say that along with the terrific acting, beautiful cinematography & a great jazz score, there are some of the most nailbitingly suspenseful moments in any film I can remember since Hitchcock at his best - & coming from me that's high praise indeed!What I liked most about the film is it's ambiguity  is Ripley diabolically evil, or is he just mixed up? How much of what he does is coldly premeditated, & how much is a crime of passion'? Even though he is a thoroughly nasty piece of work, you somehow find yourself identifying with & even rooting for him, & to me this is the film's triumph. Either that or I just have a few too many dark cellars' of my own!",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Of course Jude Law and Cate Blanchett are stellar, as was Philip Seymour Hoffman, in a small, but important role. But the kudos go to the director and writer.

322,jtdurden,A very good film.,9,30 October 2001,"The Talented Mr Ripley is an unusual film, an eerie tale of jealousy, violence, loneliness, and desperation. Tom Ripley is a man who has, in his own mind, no self worth, no identity, and no substance. His ideas of life and existence depend on how he is perceived by others, and when that is no longer good enough..... Matt Damon is superb as the shy, self effacing Tom Ripley, an outwardly timid, unassuming man who shows little sign of what lurks beneath his pleasant front. Jude Law is also great as the vain, fickle Dickie Greenleaf, the rich boy who befriends Tom, and Gwyneth Paltrow also shines through as the loveable Marge, Dickie's girlfriend. Fans of the Patricia Highsmith novels will not be disappointed, as Anthony Minghella has superbly crafted her excellent literary prose onto the screen. This must also be one of the most skillfully shot movies of recent times, the scenery is fantastic and seldom has Italy been portrayed as such a beautiful country. This movie is definitely worth watching. It is becoming increasingly rare for movies to evoke serious emotions within the viewer, and with The Talented Mr Ripley, there are many occasions where these such emotions are aroused. A very good film.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
323,jon-88,Great acting; Unwise plot changes...,8,25 December 1999,"Well, a decision has been made in transferring the book to the screen which I think diminishes the interest of the main character, the talented Mr. Ripley.In the book, Tom Ripley is a sociopath who murders to achieve a certain class-status.  The genius of the book is that he succeeds completely in assuming the identity of a wealthy spoiled playboy, by scrupulous observation - the book thus says something about the surface-consciousness of the rich; that you just have to look right, act right, and have the cash, and you belong.(Some Movie Plot Points follow - so only read on if you don't care about knowing what happens:)Minghella, the director and screen-adapter, decides to take what was a subtle homosexual subtext and make it completely overt.  To me, this makes Ripley's actions much more obvious, and on some level pitiful - here he murders because of lost love as much as he murders out of envy or out of some psychotic desire to actually *become* someone else... but murder due to unrequited love is something we've all seen before.While the changes in plot points make Ripley more sympathetic, they also make it easier to predict subsequent events, much to the detriment of the film.  It would have been considerably more interesting sailing this ship without having a clear character map to guide us.One last thing about the homosexual angle - it's inclusion muddies the waters in another way...  it takes two to tango, and what isn't clear is how far Dickie goes in returning Ripley's affection.  If Dickie wasn't interested at all, why tolerate Ripley's fairly honest passes?  If Dickie was interested, why treat Ripley the way he does?The direction and acting are very strong (though there were a few camera angles which screamed `I've Seen Hitchcock and Really Liked Him.')  Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the clear-eyed best friend was great. Damon plays this sociopath as a naive child looking for love and acceptance - there's this amazingly well-acted and creepy scene where Ripley does an imitation of Dickie's father, for Dickie - quite a display of acting chops by Damon, who also does a dead-on conversation of Dickie and his girlfriend talking to each other, playing both roles.  Paltrow gives a fine performance, as does Jude Law.
All-in-all, a very enjoyable film.  I just think Mr. Minghella needs to learn that sometimes it's better *not* to provide all the answers.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

I thought it was great.It had a Hitchcockian feel to it, in the story development and the way suspense is spread out in the movie. This is much closer to a ""North by Northwest"" type of movie. Of course, when the general public is used to ""Scream""-like suspense, this could seem as a rather dull and lengthy movie. But the essence of it is more than that. I had a real feel of the dolce vita, so bad that you love the guy's life (young Greenleaf) and hate him at the same time.Photography is superb, and for once, an ending scene that is so un-hollywoodlike most people will hate it!.You won't be overwhelmed, but you won't be deceived either.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

329,Javert-5,"Nice Scenery, Matt Damon Annoying",6,10 March 2000,"Like most other viewers I'd have to say that the scenery of the Italy is very nice. The Director has done a great job as he did with the English Patient.The movie however like most who are derived originally from novels, does not really tell the story how it was intended. The insertion of Kate Blanchette character along with 'Petar' is both annoying and irrelevant. Likewise some of the pro Homosexual vibes,  were over-exaggerated or made up for the movie and had nothing to do with the book. Likewise, the portrayal of Dickie of being a spoilt self centred kid is also a little over-exaggerated compared to the book.Matt Damons I don't think was all that great. He doesen't really have much of a talent in transforming himself from movie to movie. His smile is cliche and annoying. Jude Law in contrast was not bad in playing the role of Dickie.All in all, i don't think this story was made for the cinemas. It is a dry story which is more suited to the print Media than what was attempted in the big screen. This slowness is seen throughout the whole film.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
330,gazelle,A disturbing wonder,8,30 December 1999,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this film going in, and I'm not sure how I feel about it after walking out. I definitely recommend it, yet I find it disturbing in a subtle way.  Mr. Damon is both endearing and frightening, as is Mr. Law;  Ms. Paltrow is fine as usual, and yet they all, including Ms. Blanchett, Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Davenport, seem otherworldly.  I suppose they should be: rich, young, and generally free of purpose, they live beautiful lives in an Italy that could not be more lovely. Marge is a frail blonde angel, while Dickie is a golden, jazz-playing Apollo, and Ripley is a ghost in multiple pale disguises. Mr. Minghella's direction is as artistically provocative as ""The English Patient,"" his last film, but takes a much less leisurely pace.  While not quite taut,  suspense and emotion are not lacking, and it is as thoughtful about the truths of life as some films, like ""The Sixth Sense,"" are about the truths of death.  Law and Paltrow, so distanced from the troubles of life, are the most affected by the deceptions and desperation of Ripley, but it is Ripley who frightens, for his violence comes from turning his pain outward.  Yet, as horrible as he becomes, we can still empathize with him. Most of us have known the anger and hurt of the outsider, and Mr. Ripley could be any of us.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

332,Corinthian,Not for everyone.,7,2 January 2000,"I found The Talented Mr. Ripley to be a fairly decent movie.  A strong cast, excellently directed, gorgeous settings, and a suspenseful plot, with Jude Law delivering both the strongest performance and the most intriguing character.But be forewarned: as with too many films of today, though, the film is marketed as something it is not.  The film is darker, heavier, and slower than it appears to be.  The regular movie-goer may not enjoy it much if they're accustomed to thoughtless swill like Titanic.  And some won't appreciate the homo-erotic undertones, apparently since, well into the movie, they become overtones.  What starts off as subtle allusions become over-the-top, so much so that the audience expects the characters to start shouting ""I'm gay!"" any moment.The Talented Mr. Ripley is long and can be slow for some, but watch it, just for the jazz scenes, for the fantastic soundtrack, and watch it for Jude Law's scene-stealing performance.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The movie, while probably not a thriller per se (there was nothing to make the viewer gasp or jump out of his seat), was suspenseful and, even though a visit to the restroom was desperately needed, this viewer was glued to his seat.  I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
334,nathan19,Duality makes this film an heir to Hitchcock's classics.,9,3 January 2000,"Duality -- the ability to be one person in a certain situation, and another in another -- is the underlying and pervading theme of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley.""  It is a theme that sparks the central conflict of the picture, that influences each of the main character's decisions and actions.  Each character in the film is either pretending to be something else, or playing directly to a superficial identity.  The film unravels each of the character's motivations for doing so, and in so doing strips away the layers of reality we construct for ourselves.  Characters either uncover the explicit duality of their lives (Cate Blanchette's willingness to admit that she travels under another name), or have it uncovered for them (Tom Ripley). When each character is laid bare, when each character is most fully themselves, when each character stops acting and pretending, they are undone.The film presents a main character who does his best to pursue another life -- but he cannot ultimately follow through with it.  We are trapped by who we are, aren't we?  Gwyneth tries to become Dickie's ideal woman, to avoid asking him to settle down, but she cannot -- she wants the home and the family.  This is her undoing -- she weeps in the film, ""I must have pressured him"".  Dickie can't escape the fact that he loves the nightlife -- that he strays, that his attention only lasts as long as the diversion. He says he will marry Gwyneth, but we know that his eye can never stop roaming. This is his undoing.  Dickie's pal -- superficially polite, while snide and arrogant at the same time -- is much smarter than he appears, which leads to his undoing as well.  When each of the characters lets their guard down and becomes who they are, it destroys them.  Each of the characters has a tragic flaw that they try to ignore, or play to, a flaw which undoes the perfect lives they all pursue.The ironic twist is that Tom Ripley is the catalyst for all of this -- yet, his tragic flaw is that he has no flaw.  While each of the main characters has an identity they are running from, Ripley HAS no identity to speak of. He starts out pretending, and he pretends through the entire film.  Who IS Tom Ripley?  Even Tom himself wants to know.  One would think that this would enable him to become the perfect actor -- when you paint on a blank canvas, one would think you can paint anything.  But even Tom, blank as he is, distills down to someone -- even if it is a blank canvas, a ""real nobody.""  And it is not only himself he is unsure of -- it is the entire world around him.  Among his first lines in the film is a line uttered while listening to a jazz record -- he mumbles to himself, ""Can't tell if it's a woman or a man.""  It is this uncertainty that informs the world he sees, and how he relates to it.  Is Tom gay or straight?  Is he evil or good?  Even Tom doesn't know.The film points out that we cannot run from our own darker half.  We are all tempted to become someone else -- anyone who has been made fun of in school, who has longed for the life of the rich and famous, can identify with this The enemy is not without, it is within.  It is this same duality which haunted and tormented so many of Hitchock's characters, most notably (but not exclusively) Norman Bates in ""Psycho.""  ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a worthy heir to that film classic in its ability to get the audience to sympathize and empathize with Tom.  We feel his love for Dickie Greenleaf -- we feel his frustration at being shut out of his life -- we feel the awkwardness of being trapped in a situation that was never intended.  As we watched Marion Crane's car pause in the swamp and waited breathlessly, perversely hoping it would sink and allow Norman's mother to get away with murder, so too we watch Tom Ripley descend into darkness, and when the cops arrive at his hotel, we wait breathlessly with Tom, hoping he will get away.Duality is present within us all... and while we are taught ""to thine own self be true,"" in this film it is only when we are true to ourselves, that true pain comes.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
335,nathan19,A 90s Hitchockian thriller?,9,29 December 1999,"Possibly -- or the closest we may get to one.  The film makes some brave choices -- first, in its decision to avoid the stark colors of black and white which so frequently affect how we see the main protagonist (don't believe me?  See the scene where Ripley and Peter are talking about dungeons -- Peter is clad in black, Ripley in white).  Ripley is not a sociopath or psychopath, but simply a young man, unsure of himself (one of his first lines addresses his inability to distinguish a jazz singer by his/her voice), his sexuality, and his place in the world.  He has made a hobby out of impersonating others.  He is caught in a situation he never intended to be in, a situation that rapidly spirals out of control.
Additionally, the choice to make Ripley homosexual is certainly a brave one, especially by modern Hollywood standards.  The waters of sexual attraction were never more muddied than they are in this film -- Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow both love Jude Law, who loves neither.  In the complicated relationship that develops between Paltrow and Damon, Damon is the mistress to Paltrow's wife-figure.  This underscores the tension that develops between them as Damon tries to incorporate himself into Law's life (and identity).  It makes for a fascinating dynamic that is never explored, since after the murder Paltrow has nothing to do except get more and more suspicious (a tough motivation to play).  The presence of Cate Blanchette's character muddies waters even more -- Damon is no screaming queen, and there is a sense in which as he plays out Dickie's life he is allowed to become a virtual Jekyll and Hyde -- he is both a sophisticated, suave man about town, attracted by and to women, and a repressed, insecure, frustrated homosexual man running from his own conscience.  Is he gay, or not?  Is he a good kid simply drawn in to bad circumstances, or is he a murderer?  By allowing this uncertainty to play itself out without a complete resolution at the end, the film dares to invite its audience to make up its own mind -- a brave standard by any measure in today's climate.The theme of duality also pervades the film, much as it did in Hitchcock's work (""Psycho"" and ""Strangers on a Train"" are two obvious examples).  Shots are constantly framed awkwardly and intentionally -- props, buildings, even whole sides of the city mix together that don't fit.  Dark and white contrast in the frame -- and each character is off-set by one another, no more so than Cate Blanchette and Gwyneth Paltrow.  At one point Damon drives down a road populated with mirrors, which are often a visual clue in Hitchcock's films.The film is finally Hitchockian in its central question -- ""how far would you go to be someone else?""  Anyone who was ever picked on in school -- anyone who has ever idolized the rich and famous -- can appreciate what Damon's character faces in the film.  Hitchcock always peopled his films with characters with whom you could identify with -- ordinary people cast into extraordinary circumstances.  The film puts a mirror up to us and asks, ""how well do you know yourself?""  By placing us in the position of Matt Damon's character, we are forced to ask, ""while these things he commits are terrible, can you honestly say that you wouldn't/couldn't do these things if placed in the same position?""  The film's ultimate question -- ""how well do you know yourself?"" -- is the most profound...and the one it leaves us asking.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
336,marioncap,"Brilliant, terrifying movie",9,24 June 2012,"I was thrilled and terrified by this movie, but also shocked that none of its reviewers seemed to understand it. Almost every review I've read misses the point of Tom Ripley's degrading job at Carnegie Hall's men's room: He worked the job so he could hear great music for free; for an aspiring young concert pianist, it was actually a pretty good job in the 1950s.Nobody seems to have noticed that while Dickie Greenleaf just wants to goof around in Europe, Tom Ripley actually wants to play the piano professionally. Yes, of course he wants to be rich, but he doesn't just want to be rich for the sake of being rich. When Freddy finds him in Rome, he finds him because his landlady hears him practicing the piano at all hours. Tom Ripley longs for the rich life, but he wants it so he can play the piano! His horrible tragedy is not only that he kills the only person who can ever love him; it's also that he kills the only person who could ever understand and embrace him as an artist.

In fact, after a while, since you as the audience get to see his private moments you feel like his confidante and ultimately hate the fact that you are his confidante. It is almost like making a best friends with a innocuous guy and then being unable to get out of the relationship after realising he is a fiend. The guile and the pretences are shown as coming absolutely naturally to him, with absolutely no effort. Jude gets almost a guest appearance, so does Gwynyth and everyone else. They are all supporting cast to this one man show. But they do well with the briefs given to them. Howsoever used to this genre you are (thriller/drama), there would definitely be one gasp you would let out watching this one.

338,ulyssestone,Thrilling but not Jazz,7,17 January 2005,"I saw five Ozu's films in the past week and I feel kind of exhausted, so I paid a visit to The Talented Mr. Ripley. You know, it's like after spending four nights for Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, one might be very like to go to a jazz bar to freshen up. The first half hour of this film really made me felt that I am going to enjoy some jazz, but suddenly that shy guy became a killer! I thought, oh what's going on? What's wrong with him and the whole thing? And as time went by I was more and more into his dangerous game. I really didn't want this film to end because I wonder how long he could hold on. The end is dark because he actually killed a man who really loved him, and had no distance left to run. An exciting film, and what left for one to rethink is the complex of humanity. Maybe I didn't quite catch up with the opening, so I am not sure why this talented guy is so sly and false, it seems that he drops those jazz albums advisedly, but his love towards Greenleaf seems is true. So when I see him playing Bach in Greenleaf's house after he killed Greenleaf, I couldn't help but want to search out something behind his big glasses. Maybe the answer is hiding in our deepest minds",The Talented Mr. Ripley
339,jdavisbruin,Talented is an Understatement,9,30 November 2005,"This is as good as films come and a wonderful period piece of 1950s Europe. Directed and written by Anthony Minghella, the director of The English Patient and Cold Mountain, Mr. Ripley involves the exploits of Tom Ripley, played to chilling perfection by Matt Damon, who initially travels from his native Manhattan to Venice to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the spoiled son of a multi-millionaire. Tom becomes enamored by Dickie's illustrious lifestyle--and perhaps with Dickie as well--but when Dickie tires of Tom, Tom murders Dickie and passes himself off as the millionaire.What makes this movie so wonderful--besides the incredible writing, beautiful cinematography, homo erotic relationship between Matt Damon and Jude Law, and the occasional shots of the two star's backsides--is the stellar cast. Matt Damon is dead on as Tom Ripley. He is boyish, charming, and fragile yet sinister and capable of anything. Sociopaths haven't been played this well since Anthony Perkins in Psycho. What makes Damon's performance more fun is how you never know everything about the character. Is he gay? Is he straight? Is he bi? Is he even aware of what he is doing? Does he feel remorse? You never know. The whole character is an act and an illusion who fools both the other characters and the audience.Jude Law also turns out a star-making performance as Dickie Greenleaf. Jude's a charming man's man and a throwback to the leading men of the 50s and 60s, so he fits this role like a glove, and as we know now he can identify with the womanizing side of his character. Nevertheless, Jude's charisma and charm make it easy to believe why Matt Damon's character would be so taken by him.The rest of the cast--led by Gweneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Seymour Hoffman--is amazing as well. The Talented Mr. Ripley is a sexy, provocative, superbly acted nail-biter. Hitchcock would be proud to see a suspense film like this.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
340,peter_lantz,"Top Notch Acting, Subpar Story...",4,24 November 2017,"I'm apparently going against the grain of most of the reviews on IMDb, but I'm OK with that, I think it's good to have diverse opinions. I had watched this movie in great anticipation as all I've heard is that this is one of the best movies. I'll start with the things I liked. What I liked:All the acting is done very very well, there are for sure some great acting by some AAA actors. Matt Damon and Jude Law and other actors own their roles and are very believable. The setting was amazing as well, and very immersive. What I disliked:I didn't like the plot at all. I think the writers for the movie were confused on where they wanted to take the film. I saw the Matt Damon character eventually taking over the Jude Law's character's life, but I was disappointed with how that all happened. Granted, I haven't read the book, so I don't know the source material, so it probably follows the source material, which I'm sure I wouldn't have been a fan of either. I was wishing they would have capitalized on the abilities of copying people a little more than they did. I felt that was wasted on him trying to cover his tracks, which it turns out he wasn't very talented at. What I was kinda hoping the movie would do was the, Matt Damon's character had been studying Jude's character ever since he'd been there. The letters he was sending were actually letters to slowly take over Jude's life so by the time Jude was about to call it quits, on paper, Matt Damon was Jude Law, and Matt Damon had everything, the money, girl, house, etc. In the end Matt Damon just looked like a creepy stupid serial killer, that wasn't 'Talented' at all and will eventually get caught, because he's dumb. I hated the ending, and while I understand not every story has a happy ending, I was hoping he'd get caught and have the book thrown at him. The whole back story of why Jude's character thrown in there and the investigator giving the wink and the nod to Matt Damon to not say anything didn't work for me. I gave this film a 4 because the actors/acting is the only thing that makes this movie watchable for me. If this wasn't on point, it would have been a 1 for sure.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
341,nms1982,be careful what you wish for,9,22 July 2018,"Tom Ripley is a young, pasty fellow with a knack for imitation (and accumulating skills) and little to no experience of the world outside his neck of the woods when a well-to-do older fellow approaches him about a son living it up in Italy on daddy's money who he wants to come home. Will Tom go over and persuade him to do so, for pay and expenses?Such is the setup to one of my favorite films and among Matt Damon's best, and arguably one of the best of the '90s (though it was released in the final week of that decade). Based on Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel of the same name, the first in a quintet, it is the most faithful adaptation of two - the other being ""Purple Noon."" In this version Ripley, after falling in love with the young man's life and possibly the young man (Dickie), decides to use his various abilities (one of which is an aptitude for homicide) to dispatch him and appropriate his identity. Regardless of whether he loved or was merely infatuated with Dickie one thing about the apparently scrupleless titular character is clear: Ripley does not love himself; who he is, actually is, will not do. Perhaps 'becoming' someone else allows him some temporary relief. But it also opens the door to all sorts of problems, both legal and social - ultimately necessitating more murders.Can the creepy chameleon with a preference for the finer things ever be free of the law's long reach, or himself? Is Ripley incapable of love or is he only unable to not kill those he loves? This film is a superb character study, of an atypical, multifaceted sociopath on the loose in Europe (and with the skills to pay the bills - in someone else's handwriting). Featuring a solid supporting cast that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, James Rebhorn, and Jude Law as a charisma-oozing priveleged type - and helmed by ""The English Patient"" director Anthony Minghella - ""Ripley"" is a thriller/drama that is a cut above.

351,busy-boy,Unwatchable on so many levels,1,16 February 2010,"Matt Damon must have been doing a wonderful job portraying Tom Ripley because, after a half hour or so, I thoroughly hated him and hated this movie with an actual feeling of violence in my heart, as if I had been viewing a snuff film. I got up, leaving my wife with the other couple we were spending an evening with, and walked out of the theater, cleared my head of the images still stuck in it, then walked into a different theater in the multiplex that was showing ""Galaxy Quest"" and happily let this simple comedy wash my brain of any remnants of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" I can name on one hand, with a finger left to spare, all the movies I have walked out on. This one stands out above the rest. (The Money Pit, Blind Date, and Lost in America are the others.

352,sdlewis-3,"Review: ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""",8,2 April 2009,"For years, I had had mixed feelings about sitting down and finding out just why Mr. Ripley was so talented. On the one hand, the good things I'd heard about the film; on the other, my personal dislike for Mr. Matt Damon. Don't get me wrong - he's a great actor, but there's just something about him that makes me not particularly like him. Obviously, considering the presence of this review, the ""good things I heard"" hand won the battle, and luckily for me, it worked in my favor. The film, nominated for five Oscars (including one for Jude Law in a supporting role), was fantastic. The acting overall was phenomenal, especially from Davenport and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has a small but extremely important role. However, the real credit should go to Damon, who truly delivers one of his better performances in this one. Watching Ripley's transformation over the course of the film is breath-taking, and despite the ramifications the character should be suffering, he always finds a way out of trouble (or he just gets ridiculously lucky). I often found myself wondering aloud how anyone could possibly find their way out of such a sticky situation only to be shown that it is indeed possible with the right amount of skill and luck. The movie's a tad long, but it really never feels that way because it really grabs the viewer and takes you on the journey through happiness and bliss as well as loneliness, anger and utter despair. You feel the emotions that Ripley feels, and the film's ability to do so makes it one of the great ones in my book.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

For me, that was one of the most disturbing sequences I've ever witnessed. I ran home, locked the door, dashed up the stairs, and hid under my blanket. I didn't want to talk to ANYBODY after that. It genuinely messed me up inside. I never think horror movies are scary. Monsters are just stupid. The devil ain't real. But, crazy people ARE real. That scene may have been metaphorical, but somehow, I understood it. It opened my eyes to the inner workings of a psychotic mind, and I didn't like it. Nope, that scared the crap out of me. That's true horror, right there. When it all makes perfect sense. When you gaze into the eye of madness. That's why you shouldn't watch that part.

355,Miyagi,I want two hours of my life back,2,10 January 2000,"The Talented Mr. Ripley was probably one of the worst movies that I've seen in recent years.  It was a blatant attempt at being an ""artsy"" movie, and an utter failure at that.  The story line was long and dragged out and never got on track.  I have been left with a million unanswered questions about this film, and to be honest, I'm not in any hurry to have them answered. Here are a few of my complaints:1.  Many of the scenes were totally unnecessary adding to the horrible length of the film.2.  There were references to homosexuality throughout the film, which would in itself not bother me, however, it was NEVER cleared up and left me feeling a little bit uncomfortable.  (To understand what I mean by this see the film, on second thought don't waste your time and money.)3.  Gwyneth Paltrow was her usual bland self.  Will she ever play someone again who is not either rich or British?There were a few bright spots in the film, Matt Damon did fairly well in portraying a confusing and rather psycho, but somehow shallow character.The scenery was beautifulThe jazz part of the soundtrack had a few tunes that even had this non-Jazz fan tapping his feet.All in all I give this film a 2 of 10",The Talented Mr. Ripley

360,jonathancruano,Will the Real Mr. Ripley Please Stand Up?,9,13 May 2020,"Anthony Mingella's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a great film not as an entertainment, because of the different ideas it explores. The movie suggests in subtle ways that protagonist Tom Ripley (played by Matt Damon) might not be Tom Ripley at all. Instead, the protagonist has been impersonating different people for so long that his true identity has been lost somewhere in the distant past. The protagonist appears at the beginning of the film as a pianist playing alongside a female opera singer. He introduces himself to wealthy shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf as ""Tom Ripley"" from Princeton University, but how can we trust anything this young man says? The protagonist is not a pianist enrolled Princeton and therefore it is not a stretch for him to lie about his name as well. Furthermore, the female operate singer is unlikely to challenge the lie. She is covering up for her fellow musician (probably the real Tom Ripley) who for reasons that are unknown to us is unable to make it to the concert recital.Consequently, this movie is really about a person who is a mystery in plain sight. The protagonist's name and origins are mysterious, because he is convinced that his own worth is inextricably linked to membership in the exclusive social circles of the super rich. And throughout this movie, we see the protagonist adopt different personas and assume greater risks as he tries to convince everyone that he has blue blood running through his veins.It is tempting to write off Matt Damon's character as an outlier, given his penchant for violence and talent for pretending to be different characters. Yet this film and Patricia Highsmith's novel might be making a statement about our society. We live in a world of Tom Ripley's or, to put the matter more crudely, phony people. They are the employees and managers in corporations who pretend to appear smarter than they are in order to secure promotion. They appear in bureaucracies and political parties. As politicians rise to the top, they end up living in the land of the platitude. Lastly, there is no shortage of individuals who want to associate with celebrities and the amazingly wealthy in order to elevate their own status. And the overriding motivation for this superficiality is because many people are so insecure about themselves that, at a deeper level, they want to convince outsiders that they are someone else.Therefore, even though ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" comes across as entertaining fantasy, it is also surprisingly familiar. Among the exclusive social circles of the Ivy League elites and the wealthy, an artificial distance is created between these circles and the outsider. Outsiders are made to less worthy, because they do not share in the same status and social norms of the people born into wealth, educated in the best schools, and in possession of privileged networks. The feelings of exclusion and rejection bred by these inclusive social circles are a recurring theme in literary works, such as ""Marriage of Figaro"", ""The Great Gatsby"" novel, and Patricia Highsmith's ""The Talent Mr. Ripley"" (which uses the glittering world of wealth and privilege as the backdrop to murder and impersonation) and are still relevant in the present day. Since the theme of exclusive social circles and snobbery is so familiar, we are almost tempted into taking a rooting interest in the protagonist without a name and his social climbing efforts.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Really.While watching this movie, I kept wondering when it was going to pick up and get moving.  It's supposed to be a thriller, right?  Like ""The Thin Red Line,"" there is no flow, and it's just an endless stream of pretty pictures. So it's impossible to tell when this movie is going to end.  When the last reel came up, I almost had to sneak into ""Bicentennial Man"" to preserve my sanity.  There's only so much pseudo-intellectual garbage I can take before begin to crave sappy drivel starring Robin Williams. Unlike English Patient, there isn't a gunfight or explosion every once in a while to keep us interested.  In fact, this movie really gives us nothing interesting other than some gorgeous locations that filmmakers got a chance to enjoy.

362,mp-14,Disappointing suspenser is too much surface dazzle,6,29 December 1999,"Despite many flashes of visual style, this film misses opportunity after opportunity to be a truly Hitchcockian study of sociopathology.  The scene in the lobby of the opera house, for example, directed by Hitchcock, would have been a genuine gasper.  Other, more obvious gaffes:  the film begins with narration, which never recurs (Where is Ripley when he is telling us this story?  Why is he telling it?  Why have only one line of this narration?); the skyline in the background of the opening scene is modern day.  The film comes vividly to life in scenes where Ripley's buried emotions come to the fore -- in the boat, for example, or in the final scene -- but ultimately Matt Damon is not a strong enough actor to bring this fascinating character to life.  Both he and Gwyneth Paltrow, in fact, seem startlingly amateurish alonside Jude Law, Cate Blanchet, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who are all superbly confident.  The tendency of visual and sound effects to dominate modern movies here invades what could have been a wonderfully complex character study; instead it seems to be a film about photography and jazz.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Cate Blanchett (oh Cate!) shines with her short role;  one of her great follow ups to her superb role as Elizabeth.Minghella shows once again how a story should be told; his direction is quite extraordinary surely an oscar nom for him.

371,SuperCoop,a Classic Film,10,29 January 2001,"The Talented Mr. Ripley was probably one of the most overlooked and under appreciated films of all time.  Anthony Minghella out does his last film (The English Patient) with this stylish, creepy, and all to realistic drama. What drew me to this film was that it had such a flawed lead character never has a film taken a stereotypical ""bad guy"" and made his actions seem so just.  What makes Tom Ripley such a mysterious main character is how we never know quite for sure what's going on in his head until the brilliant climax of this film.  The scene where Tom and Dickie are on the boat is one of the best scenes ever, your mind takes so much in it's hard to believe the scene takes place.  While the plot alone is enough to make this film one of my all time favorites, what pushes it up a notch is it's magnificent ensemble cast.  Jude Law plays Dickie who jumps between being a charming and charismatic best friend to being cold and ruthless.  Gwyneth Paltrow is what holds this film together she is the moral center of the film, and the only one with any idea of what is going on.  Cate Blanchett steals every scene she is in(which is impressive since she shares most of the screen time with Damon). Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Dickie's rich american friend.  Matt Damon gives a performance I don't believe he could ever out do, he plays Ripley on so many emotional levels you slowly begin to understand the complex Ripley.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

However, I digress.Why wasn't I bowled over by this? Simple answer. Tom Ripley may have bisexual leanings but he's not hysterical. The key turning point in the book is a premeditated murder but this adaptation portrays it as a crime of passion. The truly chilling aspect of his character in Highsmith's novel is the ease with which he plans and executes this murder, presumably his first.This threw me completely. I didn't expect the film to be able to get things like Tom's poor opinion of Dickie's Italian but I thought getting the motive right would have been possible.But for the changes to Tom's character I though the film was actually quite good. Philip Seymour Hoffman was superb as Freddie Miles. The opening sequence was a bravura piece of film-making, expertly edited by Walter Murch.

Through the viewpoint of the title character played by Damon, we also see the journey of a sociopath who believes that he finds happiness by assuming the identity of someone else and relishing in that person's lifestyle. The film's aided by breathtaking photography shot on location in Italy, a fascinating yet haunting score (including the jazz), some suspense, romantic intrigue (even the unrestrained homoerotic undertones), a top-notch script, and direction that helps increase interest due to the way the late Anthony Minghella made it.

Starting with the opening title sequence, following with the high-tension-tightly-constructed screenplay, the whole underlined by a deep, warm, both tense and light soundtrack, Minghella created a little cinematic pearl that has little or nothing to envy to The Master.The story of this guy that finds ""his way"" in Europe at the expenses of rich and trustful Americans never disappoints, and keeps you wondering what's he gonna do next.The script has no flaws, and the acting is superb.  This mostly young cast delivered an excellent string of performances, and one above all is Damon's. He definitely gave his best in this picture, and showed us many sides of his craft of which we were still unaware.  Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow are both great, and so is Cate Blanchett, although hers is more of a cameo than a real supporting role.  Hoffman and Rebhorn round up an excellent list of players.Technically also the movie is perfect: art directors and set decorators effortlessly bring us back to the 50's; the cinematography is professional and the costume design excellent.Yared's soundtrack is powerful but not excessive, and can be both dramatic or romantic according to the moment.Overall, an excellent picture that will not disappoint you at any moment and that has its strengths in its script, score, and, above all, acting.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The movie explorers the character of Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a down and out wannabe piano player. Ripley meets the father of Dickie Greenleaf(Jude Law) at a party and the father in turn offers Ripley money to travel to Italy and bring back his son.  What unfolds is a journey into the mind of a sociopath who will do whatever it takes to join Greenleaf's world.Damon and Law deliver top notch performances in this Anthony Minghella directed piece.  Damon's performance is his best date, rivaled perhaps by only his performance in ""Good Will Hunting.""  Law is perfectly cast as the American playboy spending daddy's money in Europe.  The two female leads in ""Ripley"" are Gwenyth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett.  Paltrow plays Marge, Dickie's girlfriend and delivers a performance that is at times bland. Blanchett plays Meridith Logue, an American girl who is also rich.  Her, along with Phillip Seymour Hoffman, are vastly underused in this piece and I would have even liked to see Blanchett in Paltrow's part.The movie, although a bit long and drawn out (much like the English Patient), delivers in the end and should be considered one of the best of the year(near the bottom of my top ten, albeit).",The Talented Mr. Ripley
381,Kritic-3,Intelligent. Riveting. Enthralling,8,30 December 1999,"There is one thing Tom Ripley does not lie about, and that is the fact that he is very good at lying.  In the early stages of the movie, when asked what he is good at, he replies honestly and nonchalantly: forging signatures, telling lies, and making impressions of other people.  The movie begins with Tom Ripley(Matt Damon)lying to one, Mr. Greenleaf, as he assumes the identity of one of Mr. Greenleaf's sons colleagues from Princeton.  From that point on, Mr. Ripley finds himself traveling to Italy to find Greenleafs son, Dickie(Jude Law). As the movie progresses, we watch the gradual yet ingenious identity change of Tom Ripley to becoming a friend of Dickie.  As time goes on, and Tom studies Dickie, he forges a friendship, and ditches his attempts to bring Dickie home.  Soon enough however, Ripley changes his identity again, and it is fascinating and compelling to see it.  Through murders and lies the talented Mr. Ripley has become Dickie.  The movie is a quite intelligent thriller, and it introduces a suitable idea for our time.  It is a story of a man who becomes someone else, and feels that he will be better off that way.  The directing and cinematography are compelling, and the story itself is fantastic. The acting is superb, especially Damon and Law(Paltrow is good too). Ripley is the villain in the film, yet the audience find themselves compelled to side with him. Because of the horrific behavior of Dickie and Freddy(Philip-Seymour Hoffman) we want Ripley to get away with it all.  In the end however, Ripley finds that he is disgusted with what he has become.  ""I thought it would be better to be another somebody than my own nobody"", is how he states it. Ripley finds that he has done wrong, yet the ending opens another undiscovered side of the talented mr. ripley.   ********(8 stars of 10)",The Talented Mr. Ripley
382,hamlet65,Save a few dollars and rent Purple Noon,5,28 December 1999,"This is one of the films; I eagerly awaited this year based upon the excellent first version of this story ""Purple Noon"".  I had my misgivings when I saw the cast, particularly Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon.  Her gopher grin and lack of depth manages to cast a pall on anything she is in. How she one the Academy Award over the brilliance of Fernando Montenegro, illustrates that money and hype will always win out over artistry.  She is a spoiled rich girl with an extremely narrow emotional range.  The roles that are bought for her require the fullness and variety of an orchestra, unfortunately her register is that of a violin's A-string.  Matt Damon reminds me of John Tesh with the somewhat blonde Frankenstein appearance. His level of depth runs the gamut of a goofball smile or a pouting sneer.  I would have preferred someone who can act like Henry Thomas or Robert Sean Leonard.  They would have been able to provide this intriguing character with the multiple layers of emotion needed.  What else can I say but that the movie was a let down.  The only thing that is worth recommending is the cinematography and the supporting performances of Messers. Law and Hoffman. Do yourself a favor and rent ""Purple Noon"", which is infinitely better and has an one of the best endings this side of ""Chinatown.""  Alain Deloin as Tom Ripley exudes charisma that Matt Damon can only dream of possessing.

When you are a grown-up you may develop the attention span for serious films. Meanwhile, you can certainly go see Pokkemon again), the acting is very good, the soundtrack fantastic. But there was something a little less than convincing about the tension. The mood in this film comes across as artificial. Plein Soleil, made from the same novel, kept this viewer at the edge of his seat for more of the film than The Talented Mr. Ripley. Most of the tension in Plein Soleil was created by the lighting and mood of the photography. The Talented Mr. Ripley sacrificed that heightened edginess for a stronger contrast between the sensuality of the settings and the drama.
Is this better or worse? This reader is tempted to back out and say that it is a matter of taste. Both approaches are valid. Perhaps one is better than the other, but strong arguments could be made either way.Meanwhile, it is worth seeing, and plenty of reviewers are saying that it is closer to the novel than Plein Soleil.

384,m. cool,AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!,10,28 December 1999,"Matt Damon delivers a standout performance...that is oscar worthy.  He plays Tom Ripley, a unknown piano player.  When a millionaire sends him to Italy to bring back his son, he discovers a friendship with him.  Jude Law plays the son.  An excellent performance given.  Law also lives with his girlfriend Marge...Damon discovers a passion between him and Dickie (Law)...and if I tell you anymore I'll give it away...just see the movie...you'll love it!",The Talented Mr. Ripley
385,beauvallet,Pretentious travelogue,1,16 March 2003,"Sadly, the views of the Italian coast are more intriguing than the story. Damon and Paltrow somehow unlearned everything they ever knew about acting, for they are sadly miscast here. The script is entirely predictable, and Mr. Ripley is less talented -- and far less interesting -- than many another film criminal. And the pacing is deadly, as I'm coming to expect from this director.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
386,fusskins,How long will Jude Law have to play second fiddle to the likes of Gwyneth?,6,26 December 1999,"First off, I would like to identify myself as one of Jude Law's biggest fans and one of Gwyneth's greatest detractors.  I believe that 'Ripley' should give Law the fame and recognition he deserves(even though i am not looking forward to the media saturation that will undoubtedly follow w/ every entertainment outlet acting as though they just discovered him), dispel the myth that Gwyneth is anything but a moderately talented, Hollywood legacy, trust-fund baby (even though it won't), and convince Matt Damon to rid himself of that hulking little man frame he is so fond of since this movie is the first time i have ever found him mildly attractive.Now that i have gotten all of the superficial stuff out of the way, i will discuss the film.  i must admit that after i fell in love w/ Jude all over again in Cronenberg's 'eXistEnz', i immediately went out and read the Highsmith book and all of the other 4 books in the Ripley series.  Anyone who has also read the series knows that this film varies wildly from the book, but that doesn't mean it is without its merits.  Jude and Matt give very good performances, the cinematography is excellent and i think the subject matter is a bold choice for a holiday film.The problems that i had with it were its overlength (remember when movies were 90 mins long) and the unnecessary addition of certain plots and characters.  Meridith Logue and Peter Smith Kingsley worked as characters in the film but i felt that they took away more than they added.  Because of the time spent on those and the Silvana plot, we got less of a feeling of the claustrophobia of Ripley's situation after 'the deed' was done.  A lot more time should have been spent focusing on the deft way that Tom had to cover his tracks in order to keep from getting caught.  Also, the film all but eliminated the way that Tom actually did become Dickie in Rome.  He didn't cower and sulk all day; he went to parties and introduced himself as Dickie and was quite successful at it.The whole point of Ripley is his amorality.  He was a sociopath and a good one. > i think that Damon did a good job of playing Ripley as sullen and sad, but i think that it would have been more compelling if Ripley had enjoyed himself just a little bit more.In closing, Jude Law should win the Golden Globe if only for his exquisite beauty and for his ability to exude such an androgynously liquid sexuality. Very few actors have that ability and combined with his considerable acting talent, he should be recognized as the brilliant star that he is.  Also, I am having a Golden Globes party and I just love screaming at the t.v.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
387,r2detoo,"Good movie, but doesn't end well at all.",7,2 January 2000,"Overall, I was pleased with this movie.  I thought that the characters were well developed for the most part, but what happens is the movie just stops. There is no finality or sense of completion.  The reason for all of Ripley's actions are fed to you in just one line.  And I wasn't even sure if I caught it right.Still, I would recommend seeing this movie at least once.  It is a fine piece of cinema, and the soundtrack and images are wonderful.  I felt the costumes, backdrops, and props were historically accurate and helped to give a feel of Italy in 1950.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
388,amon_re2,Not a movie for everyone; definitely for those who like a complicated mystery,9,27 January 2001,"The Talented Mr. Ripley is hands down, one of my favorite movies.  Now I know that this might surprise some people, but I have some really good reasons for this, and I hope you'll either agree with me, or see it for yourself after reading this.First off, Matt Damon is really a good, solid actor.  All of his performances are so convincing, and this is definitely not any exception. The watcher can really see his mental state change throughout this movie, and that is key, repeat key in this movie.  I have seen Jude Law once before I saw this movie, and that was in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  He is a very talented actor, with a very suave manner about him, which actually made him perfect for the role of Dickie Greenleaf.The cinematography in this movie is so memorable.  It is unbelievably fantastic, and that is due to the brilliance of director Anthony Minghella. His visions are carried out with magnificently.  The opening credit scene is wonderfully done with the bars coming across the screen.  I have however seen this before in an Alfred Hitchcock film before (if anyone remembers which one, please e-mail me).The script really is well done if you think about what the movie is actually telling.  I know that seems strange, but it really is true.  If you carefully pay attention to what is going on and how Ripley is changing, the dialogue really mirrors these changes.  The shy Ripley evolves into an uncanny calm, unrattled Ripley.  Tom Ripley really is the only character who actually mentally changes during the movie.  Marge (Paltrow) slowly discovers Ripley, but thats not a change in character.  Greenleaf remains the same, as does Freddie and Cate Blanchette's character (her name escapes me).Another reason why this movie is so good:  the music.  Some movies can be made that much better, or that much worse with a soundtrack.  In The Talented Mr. Ripley, the music is made with such feeling and is so perfect for every moment in the movie.  Every little note, whether it be the jazz songs, or Ripley's classical piano, is so in tune with the movie (no pun intended).  I think this movie along with Gladiator have the most amazing soundtracks because of the quality of the music.  For those of you who don't know, The Talented Mr. Ripley was origianlly a book written by Patricia Highsmith in the 1950s.  Might I recommend reading it before seeing the movie.  Highsmith wrote a five book series with Ripley as the main character.  They all are really good, and make you see Ripley in yet another light.  I hope you can gather from what Ive said, that I really liked this movie. It is not for everyone as aformentioned.  It is somewhat disturbing, but please concentrate on the character of Tom Ripley to see how he thinks. Just see the movie and send me an e-mail telling me what you think.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
389,janiceflux,whitewash...,8,20 June 2001,"i knew nothing about this movie before i saw it, and was therefore shocked and enthralled and really liked it.  it was a bit long, and did seem to lose its way a couple of times.  my biggest problem, though, is with how it was advertised, something that i believe needs to be commented upon.  viewing the trailers for this film i was convinced that it was just another ""creepy boy obsessed with pretty girl stalks her and does anything to have her"" flick, which i definitely didn't need more of.  what disturbed me, more than anything within the film, was that it was advertised as such, when it is really about so much more, particularly the extremities of loneliness and desire.  labeling ripley a ""loser"" is ridiculous, i found his character interesting, and definitely unlike the seemingly pointlessly evil young man of the novel. (perhaps highsmith was attempting to recreate camus, but i found her attempt lacking, and i began to wonder why i should care to finish the book.) jude law was excellent, and yes terrifying, as the selfish rich american brat.  i also thought matt damon portrayed longing and solitude quite well.  but the way this movie was advertised still haunts me. hollywood obviously refuses to accept that unusual subject matter will attract anyone.  how sad. *possible spoiler warning* as for the ending, i see why it was necessary, or rather damon was able to make me see why ripley would think his actions were necessary.  just think about it, that is the way his mind works, or the way his mind has started working.  some of the comments i read seemed to dislike the ending simply because it was not a happy one.  my biggest complaint with american films is when happy endings are tacked on at any cost, even when they don't work. i think this one works.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
390,veranjank,A Very Satisfying and Intelligent Movie,8,18 February 2003,"The Talented Mr.RipleyA VERY SATISFYING AND INTELLIGENT FILMThis is a pleasant surprise: an unusually good movie that unusually brings the anti-hero to the hearts of the audience. There have been many such movies in the past; most notable being Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Ripley will join their rank.Anthony Minghella has taken great pains to recreate the 1950's Italy and the spirit of the 50's. His use of music as a continuous thread tieing up the macabre events underlines the essentially restless nature of the three main characters. The repressed homosexuality and the fear of facing the truth are marvellously expressed in the story of Ripley who actually lives the life of another (and effectively kills Ripley's identity in the process). The director is to be congratulated for not attempting a Ripley-is-finally-caught kind of ending that would have completely destroyed the film and diverted the attention to a mere technicality.I would have liked to see some more time given to the depicting of the squalor of Ripley's New York existence, because that would shed more light on Ripley's character; why he did not leave Italy after killing Dickie, why he was attracted not only to Dickie but also to his lifestyle, etc.A very satisfying and intelligent film.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
391,BioChemical,"Without Law's career-turning performance, the film would be lifeless",9,29 December 2003,"In 1996 when Anthony Minghella's infamous 'The English Patient' won all of those Oscars the film world knew that a lot was expected from Minghella in future. This time around he daringly choose to adapt Patricia Highsmith's flamboyant pot-boiler of murder set on the sun-kissed beauty of the Italian coastline. This would be an adaptation breezier than 'The English Patient' certainly sexier.With a glorious cast of Oscar Winners and Oscar Nominee's along with the sweeping grand scale the film was produced upon, the film looked promising and yet we were slightly cheated. When I sat down to watch this film I was watching for Damon's performance as his role was a complex one that if pulled off to a T would have been something rather glorious to witness. Unfortunately Damon doesn't get the audience on his side and we're left wondering who we should be 'going for'.The supporting cast were notably brilliant. Jude Law turned in a stellar perfect performance as Dickie Greenfield (the obnoxious rich boy who doesn't want to return to New York), he impacts so much upon the film that his absence in the later part leaves a great void. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchette turning in scene-stealing, almost cameo-like performances. The real disappointment however was Gwyneth Paltrow's Marge which was sorely underwritten, Paltrow works well with what she has but her character is the real sham of the film. The luscious sweeping scenery of Italy is quite stunning and really makes the film have that little more mmph, along with the cracking soundtrack.'Ripley' looked promising but with Matt Damon's quite frankly annoying performance we were slightly let down. The real star of the film however was Jude Law who rightly deserved his oscar nomination. The scenery is eye-candy but sadly it cannot make up for the less than great film in general. Still worth a look purely for the supporting cast's amazing performances.B+",The Talented Mr. Ripley

I was bored throughout the second half and was praying that the situation would PLEASE JUST UNRAVEL! (like we all knew it ultimately would)This feeling was exacerbated by not following through with devices developed in the beginning of the movie.  For example, early on, we learn of Mr. Ripley's incredible talents; however, he ultimately only puts a sliver of them to use.

When Dickey catches on to Tom's advances, he begins to ignore Tom. Out of anger and jealousy, Tom murders Dickey. The rest of the movie is about how he cunningly covers his tracks.

397,paul_bender,"Muddled, but compelling nonetheless",4,16 February 2000,"Like Anthony Minghella's previous film (""The English Patient"") the visual styling of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is rich and textured.  Mingehella knows how to light a scene and where to put the camera.  Likewise, the performances from the entire cast are fine, including the amoral, sociopathic, and rather creepy Mr. Ripley (Matt Damon).  The performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman (Freddy) is confident, range-stretching for him, and--I think--the finest in the film.  (As a slightly less relevant aside, I must say that I found the Italian scenery magnificent to watch, especially the streets of Rome, the Spanish Steps, and the Bernini fountains.)However, like ""The English Patient"", the plot is so dense (and, I would argue, muddled) that characters and their motivations become unclear as one tries to keep log of details.  (e.g. Where did Peter come from, anyway? He just shows up in the middle of the film, with insufficient introduction, rather intimately palling around with Marge at the opera.)  Now some of this I'm sure is intentional in order to enhance the meting out of this complex tale of mystery; however, I think that Minghella's delivery of drama often mistakes confusion and unclarity for suspense.I suppose that I should not complain too loudly since ""Ripley"" with its gorged plot is definitely preferable to the more common (and annoying) problem--namely, too little plot.  If you can forget about plausibility I think you will find, all in all, that the ride is intriguing and generally compelling.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Paltrow, Law, and Hoffman (as usual) were all excellent as well, perfectly embodying the idle, smug, and almost mindless security of the post Ivy league children of the rich.

Tom is hired by Dickie's father to bring him back to New York-- but when Tom gets sucked into Dickie's glamorous, wealthy lifestyle, there is nothing he wouldn't do to hold on to what he has. Beautifully shot, and very well directed-- Minghella gets fantastic performances out of his whole cast, Jude Law and Matt Damon as the standouts. Epic, sweeping scope-- and though it doesn't quite match the brilliance of Minghella's acclaimed ""The English Patient,"" it is nonetheless a wonderful, worthy follow-up.  Damon's character Ripley is one of the most fascinating in recent memory, completely amoral and yet oddly compelling-- the perfect anti-hero.

405,cinesin,I really wanted to like this film more but.....,7,24 February 2000,"I admire Anthony Minghella's work - especially 'The English Patient' and 'Truly Madly Deeply'. There is something about this man who understands the capacity behind human desire. However, this film left me with a sense of disappointment.To begin with the good aspects - many of the performances were superb. These tended to come from those actors with minor parts such as Cate Blanchett as the airy Meredith and Philip Hoffman as the sly Freddie. One could work wonders with these characters in major roles.Jude Law was great as ever and now seems to be typecast as the opulent bourgeois playboy (see him as - Bosie in 'Wilde' or as Jerome in 'Gattaca').The lighting, editing (Walter Murch), cinematography (John Seale), score (Gabriel Yared), costumes (Ann Roth)  and art/set decoration were wonderful. How wrong can you go with a team like that?The backdrop of Italian piazzas always makes for more than entertaining viewing but somehow not enough to fill the void created by Matt Damon.Now don't get me wrong - I think Damon is a talented actor. However, he has a long way to go before filling Ripley's shoes. Having said that, I think that he was largely miscast as Ripley. For me, I don't believe he was able to characterize the vulnerability (at a post screening Q & A - Minghella said he wanted to express the vulnerability behind the need for acceptance) required in Ripley.As a consequence - if the vulnerability is lost then so too, is the desire to transcend it. In this way, I was never really convinced of Ripley's dark side.Ripley is a complex character and cannot be simplified in terms of 'pure evil' and 'pure good' and this film plays with the viewer who tries unsuccessfully to catergorize Ripley into one or the other. Herein, lies the importance of Ripley's dark side.But how well does this intention work? Sure - I felt sorry for Ripley but never felt repulsed by his murderous actions (media desensitization?). The complexity was achieved on a surface level but had little psychological depth. This cannot be overlooked since this complexity and alienation essentially drive the film.I applaud Damon for taking on an ambitious role but when the fruit isn't ripe - you just don't pick it.  Sorry Anthony - I know you could be reading this but I have come to expect exceptional things from you. Look forward to your next film with eager anticipation as always.

It's a performance of great daring, especially the scene in front of the mirror in Dickie's clothing. Here's the career to watch,  Paltrow seems at first to be window dressing; she's not. But everyone does a splendid job, especially Hoffman. Look for LOTS of Oscar nominations. The original novel is brilliant, but this adaptation may be even better. And don't overlook the superb score.

I felt this adaptation moved a bit slowly, and never effectively delved into the psyche of Tom Ripley such that we truly understood his motives.

We often don't understand why people do the things they do. But there are always circumstances.  And usually ""lost love"" is the beginning. It's important for us to find our way again.I liked the way a colored horizontal bar would appear at the top or bottom of the screen at the beginnning of Talented Mr.Ripley.  It was interesting, because it made Mr.Greenleaf's hair turn yellow.  My friend says that was a style in 50's movies. When I talked to my brother on the phone briefly just before watching the movie, I asked if there was a place where I should shut my eyes.  He said there's a nudity scene.  Well that was quite brief and nothing compared to the two bludgeon scenes.In the same way that the actors created their own reality in Galaxy Quest, Mr.Ripley was acting like Dickey Greenleaf and it became his reality when the hotel desk guy made the connection for him.  It was fun watching him be one person to these people and another person to those people.  You always had to be thinking OK who do these people think he is?  The amazing thing is that Ripley pulls it off so well.  When he gets the trust fund, I just couldn't believe it.  But you can't fool a woman's intuition. SPOILER ALERT The ending is very important.  I bet Ripley could've come clean with Peter, and Peter would've still loved him anyway.  It was clear that Peter was a very understanding person.  After all, he saw Ripley kiss Meredith on the ship's stern and was very calm about the whole thing.  A lot of people spend their entire lives looking for a depth of love like that.But here's the clincher.  Ripley had already killed twice now.  The first time was a complete accident.  The second a little more intentional (to cover his tracks).  Don't forget he was probably going to kill Marge when she found the rings. After so much guilt building up, he began to contemplate murder - even to someone he actually cared about.  I'm just glad he was crying about it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The Talented Mr. Ripley is the first in a series of five novels featuring Tom and is also the one where he is most confused about himself.  The novel was already adapted into Purple Noon (1960), but now writer-director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) takes the basic framework of the novel and creates a compelling character study and a skillful thriller.Highsmith's novel Strangers on a Train was made into a film by Alfred Hitchcock, and it is no far stretch to say that Minghella has created a film that Hitchcock would have made if he were still with us.  All of the elements of Hitchcock are there: guilt, greed, lust, murder, and more guilt. Yet, Minghella's film is not a second-rate imitation; it's the real thing.The plot starts on a case of mistaken identity.  A ship magnate named Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) notices Ripley wearing a Princeton jacket and asks if he knows his son, another Princeton graduate.  Ripley had borrowed the jacket and filled in for another man, but this is of no consequence to him.  He says he remembers him, and the father offers Ripley $1,000 to go to Italy and convince the young Greenleaf to return.  How could he pass up that offer?  Ripley, a classical music aficionado, learns that the young Greenleaf is into jazz.  He spends time honing his jazz recognition skills and heads off to Italy.Ripley meets Dickie Greenleaf, played with the perfect amount of charisma and falseness by Jude Law, and his longtime girlfriend (Gwyneth Paltrow). After the pleasantries, Ripley makes mention of his jazz knowledge, and Dickie suddenly becomes interested.  A friendship blooms.Ripley has never really had a friend before, so this relationship is taken very seriously on his part.  In fact, it may be misconstrued as a homosexual attraction.  There are definitely some appropriate homo-erotic undertones to the relationship, but Ripley is too much of a human vacuum to take notice. Ripley is more enamored with the idea of Dickie than with Dickie himself. Tom admires the man so much, he doesn't even notice what a false person Dickie is.When Dickie's girlfriend and friend come between Dickie and Tom, Tom takes much offense to his rejection.  Tom has already impressed the expatriate couple of his impersonation skills, and after a brutal boat scene, Tom puts these talents to the test.Matt Damon stars in a performance worthy of the character of Tom Ripley. He is equally charming and vulnerable while still convincing us of a darker, homicidal side.  It's one of the best performances of the year.  The rest of the cast is equally accomplished.  Law is superb.  Long after his character is gone, his presence still haunts the film.  Paltrow does a nice job of convincing us she believes her boyfriend is a decent man and will eventually return to her.  The chameleon-like Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Dickie's partner in falseness Freddie Miles, and Cate Blanchett plays a fellow inheritor to family fortune.Minghella's Italy is a creation all its own.  Different locales are mixed together to give a sense of culture and beauty.  It serves as a perfect, contrasting backdrop for the events that will unfold.While Gabriel Yared's score evokes the great Bernard Herrmann (a frequent Hitchcock collaborator), music plays a much more important part in the film. Greenleaf is a jazz enthusiast, and Ripley loves classical music.  Jazz of course depends on improvisation, and we learn that Ripley is a much greater improviser than the stale Greenleaf.  In a film full of grand backdrops and rich characters, it's amazing Minghella would pay attention to such a subtle aspect of the film.  It is the sign a great filmmaker when all the elements are equally important to one's appreciation and interpretation of the film's content.The film opens and closes with a distorted and enclosed picture of Ripley. At one point, Ripley tells a friend he wants to give someone a key to a door that contains the dark parts of himself.  When the door closes on that tormented young man in the final frames, we realize his darkness will prevent anyone from seeing itself.  That paradox is Ripley's ultimate punishment.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
416,tonyle,Oh what a tangled web we weave ...,9,11 December 2000,"-Mr. Ripley- is a well-crafted psychological mind-bender that pulled me in from Tom Ripley's arrival in Italy. Most reviewers believe the storyline to be either ridiculously poor or intensely enthralling; I belong in the latter category. The only fault I see with the movie is the ending, which makes the film feel incomplete.To address the opinions of other reviewers:* The movie is too long - The movie does start off slowly; the first 40 minutes are mainly exposition and set-up for the ""meat"" of the story. After that, though, the story picks up with enough plot points and guileful Ripley machinations to where you're always asking what will happen next, and whether or not Ripley's tangled web will eventually unravel.* ""Gee, aren't I interested in some rich, gorgeous, self-centered schmuck and the dweeb who actually looks up to him. I mean, come on people? Is that America? Are my fellow Americans just dying to be perfect and rich; and nothing more?"" - No, they're not, and the fact that Tom Ripley is NOT what most of our fellow Americans are like is what makes his character so intriguingly disturbing. Also, even though Ripley is a disturbed man, the fact that Dickie Greenleaf is a ""rich, gorgeous, self-centered schmuck"" makes many a viewer side secretly with Ripley in a twist of nefariously guilty pleasure.-The Talented Mr. Ripley- is a film that definitely deserves to be seen and enjoyed.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
417,harpo-25,"Tries to be a Hitchcock thriller, but falls flat.",5,14 November 2000,"Contains spoilers.The Talented Mr. Ripley is Anthony Minghella's attempt at a Hitchcock thriller complete with murder, famous landmarks, and homosexual innuendo, however, the murder is neither surprising nor intriguing, and the homosexual innuendo is just another depiction of the gay predator. The only thing truly enjoyable are the landmarks.While the first half hour is interesting and builds quite a bit of tension as we watch Tom cleverly spin his web of lies, we see the murder of Dickie coming and we know before Tom does that Dickie's identity will be stolen, which slows the narrative to a crawl. The rest of the film becomes ridiculous as we watch Tom plot everyone's death just to keep his secret.The nude male statues and sly looks between the two men do not go unnoticed and is engaging until Minghella outs Tom in the overt bath scene. It becomes disappointing once we see Tom become a murderer several times over. It seems a homosexual still cannot be depicted as anything but the butt of jokes or as a sexual, murderous predator in Hollywood, a trend that dates back to the Universal horror films of the thirties.As a side note, Minghella's post production is strangely sloppy. There were numerous and extremely noticeable flawed voice-overs and strange still frames thrown in to presumably avoid an expensive re-shoot.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Granted, I am being a bit unfair, because it was shown on a private channel with advertisement breaks dragging this thing out to a truly unbearable 2 hours and 35 minutes.I am all for ""slow"" movies.

The direction is confident; Minghella doesn't resort to being subtle on any points, putting the audience right in the face of the characters and their experiences. One gets the feeling that the director knows where the movie will go from the beginning. This is helped by Damon's engaging and startlingly convincing performance as Ripley and a well-rounded supporting cast. Essentially, The Talented Mr Ripley is a carefully crafted, intricate film about an equally complicated but human man at the mercy of his darkest thoughts.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

But I don't know, maybe I really missed it...for me, this film does not have a protagonist that I really identify with and am pulling for during the movie.  The hows and whys Mr. Ripley is such a con man are barely touched and even so...most of the movie I was anxiously watching him sink deeper in his lies and wondering when and how he would get caught...which, if this is the moral of the story, I can certainly accept that.

My conclusion - the most pointless, meaningless movie I've seen in a long time.  I read of comparisons with Hitchcock - what a joke!  There was no mystery, and the only suspense was seeing who was to be next to be bumped off.

The acting by Damon (especially), Paltrow, and Jude Law was phenomenal. I felt sorry for the main character and feared him at the same time. The twists and turns at the end of the movie and the final scene will remain with me for ever. This is a film that I'll use to compare others of a long time to come. Matt Damon's performance is the one to beat for the 1999 Oscar!The direction and cinematography were fantastic as well.

432,Anth-8,A Very Dark Tale,6,29 December 1999,"The Talented Mr. Ripley is a movie that does so many things right...It was beautifully filmed, it was well acted, it had rich characters and a believable setup to the story line. What I think the movie failed to do was provide any reason to like, admire, or wish well on any of the principal characters presented.  Tom Ripley was a very troubled man who envied, lusted after, and then killed another troubled, yet very rich, man.  Dickie, the very rich young playboy whom Tom kills, isn't a very likeable person either. He was full of life in a 50's Kerouac kinda way, but likeable he wasn't. Tom killed one of Dickie's friends(Frankie) who was incredibly even less likeable.  In between all these killings Tom fancies himself a better man for Dickie's girlfriend and also has a Roman affair with another rich girl who remarkably turns up around every corner that Tom does. I left out the lunacy of the hard edged private detective and the idiotic father of Dickie who can't thank Tom enough for being a ""fine young man."" Please, spare me the antihero stuff, it was a sick movie of a glorified serial killer, nothing more.  I was very disappointed in Miramax, they generally never fail my expectations.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

THE FILM HAS GOT COOL STORY, GREAT ACTORS (JUDE LAW, WHOM I ADORED IN GATTACA, WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BY THE WAY) AND AN AWARD-WINNING (i forgot that it was for this cheesy-boring-to-death english patient)DIRECTOR. and so i got in the theatre. thanks God we had the bargain (before 6pm)tickets........Minghella proves he's got talent for inventing cool and intriguing stories, and absolutely no skills to tell them to anyone. just like in case of an english patient, this movie is entertaining for first 30 minutes (and it's something like 160 minutes long!). the actors show nothing interesting as well. award-winning paltrow proves the silliness of the academy award and silliness of the academy members and total lack of acting skills (well, you don't have to be an actor to be a successful....actor in Holywood after all, do you?). award-winning damon is quite convincing as psychopatic mr ripley, but a.minghella doesn't bother to show why he's like that. and that's what keeps your mind away from damon's performance. so there's only jude law remaining. and he's great again! of course, there are other actors too. and i would also name the one playing Freddie. he's really good too! if only i were to name one reason to go and see the talented mr ripley, i would say: GO AND SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL ITALY CAN BE!. but for this, it's probably better to get a NatGeo video tape. or rent a video tape with another cheesy, boring stuff with Liz Tyler and Jeremy Irons (it's all about losing virginity.......i completely forgot the title.......SORRY)!",The Talented Mr. Ripley

In the beginning we're presented Mr. Ripley, who in every aspects wishes to be something he's not. He hopes to conform himself to the lifestyle of Dickie Greenleaf, and in doing so certain grows too attached to something he can never attain. The movie plods on through many gruesome instances and has the audience waiting for the end. I assumed often that the end was near, but no, I was not that fortunate. I had to sit through more of this dull movie. If I was one to walk out of a movie I would have left after about an hour. Instead I stayed.

While not nearly as impressive as Carey in Man on the Moon, I liked Damon a lot in this role.  What really shines is a really strong plot (reminds me a bit of The Usual Suspects and The Spanish Prisoner for different reasons).  The dialog could be improved (one of the things I loved most about The Spanish Prisoner is David Mamet's dialog), but the delivery was excellent.Jude Law was extremely well cast, I'm in love with Gwyneth Paltrow, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is just a great all around character actor with an incredible range (Flawless is on my To See list).  I wish Philip Baker Hall had a bigger role (cameo), because I've never seen him in a role I didn't like (loved Hard Eight in particular -- also with Paltrow).  I'm somewhat luke warm on Cate Blanchett's acting in this movie, though she didn't have too much screen time (don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Blanchett... I thought she should have won best actress for Elizabeth last year).",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Also, a strong homosexual sub-plot takes off for which I see no relevance to the rest of the movie. The movie is loooooong and I found myself looking at my watch and thinking, how much longer? Finally, the ending left me saying ""that's it?"" with the outcome not clear. The movie had great potential, but left me disappointed.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
439,moviebuffcole,"A ravishing, emotionally complex, and heart-rending film of great elegance",10,3 January 2000,"Seeing this gorgeous tango between Damon and Law, I was never less than captivated and riveted. Minghella has fashioned something literate, powerful, seductive, charming, tragic, and beautiful. His casting is nearly perfect. Damon is unforgettable as an amoral but fascinating character whom we even sympathize with by film's end. Law is stunning as Dickie, the man whose life Ripley adores. Paltrow is good, though she is not given a whole lot to do. Blanchett is perfect in a small but pivotal role that only adds to her already impressive filmography. This is a near-masterpiece. Minghella's talent for visual opulence is second to none, and his work here should earn him a directing Oscar nod. The same goes for many others associated with this brilliant achievement. The ending is as unsuspected as it is inevitable, that is, sad and unsettling. In fact, the whole film underscores these emotions. Whereas Highsmith's original novel was cold and sometimes inert, the film makes Ripley much more of a living, breathing character, and as such, a great symbol of tragedy. It may be some time before I forget this intense experience. Certainly one that deserves multiple viewings. One of the best films of 1999.

442,main.smith,Most under-rated film this year!,8,21 March 2000,"Includes possible spoilersOne man with no shortage of talent is Mr. Anthony Minghella, and the man behind the multi Oscar winning The English Patient returns with an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's bizarre novel.The plot follows the fortunes of Tom Ripley, a twenty something American, with forgery his field of expertise. He worms his way into the lives of a rich shipyard owning family, who pay him to travel to Italy to convince their son, Dickie, to return to America. Once there he befriends Dickie, and becomes obsessed with assuming his identity: an obsession with deadly consequences.In similar style to The Beach, Ripley is a very loosely based adaptation, but unlike Boyle's latest, the film doesn't suffer from straying from the original text. In fact, after reading a series of mixed reviews, I was surprised to find this the most enjoyable film of the year so far.Ripley possesses all the typical qualities of a Minghella film, notably some wonderful art direction that captures all the charm of 50's Italy, and some impressive cast performances, which are no doubt aided by a sharp and intelligent script.Much of the talk has been of Jude Law, and although his turn as the sexually charismatic playboy Dickie is Oscar worthy, it's a performance that didn't deserve top over-shadow Damon, who hasn't recieved the credit due for his excellent portrayal of the calculated but very confused protagonist. The supporting cast also offer some competent performances, with only Paltrow prone to a touch of the 'over the top acting syndrome.Ripley's true strength is that it can be enjoyed on many levels. Fundamentally, Ripley is a thriller, but it is also an interesting study of compulsive lying, the deceitful nature of charm, and the turmoil of having no identity. Minghella has avoided the temptation to make this an edge of the seat thriller, sacrificing a degree of suspense for psychological study ,but nevertheless the film manages to maintain a creepy atmosphere throughout and has so much more depth as a result.Ripley, is not a film that will cause nightmares, nor is it a film that answers any questions, or offers any solutions. Instead it's an intelligent, intriguing and very dark insight into the life of a complex character who is at war with himself.

Instead of being on the edge of their seats, the last half hour had us squirming and begging for a merciful end to the film. For some reason, Mr Minghella forgets one of the most important elements of good film-making: pace. Throughout Mr Ripley, the pace never picks-up and stays at a steady slow drag. For a `thriller' this can only prove fatal.Although Matt Damon physically overplays his `deep intensity' so it borders on laughable, it should be noted that Cate Blanchett, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law and Jack Davenport give particularly good performances in this wasted effort.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

450,WhyFjord,A Fascinating Study,8,8 February 2003,"The most surprising element of this film was, to me, its general unpopularity. Ignoring the to-be-expected minority who didn't actually 'get it' or didn't care to 'get it' or genuinely didn't like it, this is by all accounts a very well-made film. The quality of acting, as someone mentioned, is quite high for the WHOLE cast, and this is rather uncommon in today's movie world. Matt Damon continues to surprise us with his real acting ability, and Paltrow proves that she's got the goods as well. The real highlight, for me, was the adaptation and the tone/message/feel of the film. Minghella has crafted a delightfully beautiful and unsettling work of art. And I have a hunch that this darkness, more than any artistic flaw, is the root of the film unpopularity. I suspect that not only was the film not what many viewers expected, but that it was a very difficult film for many to watch. We've become used to blood, gore, death, drugs, abuse, war, and a host of other tragedies, but how many films dare to look inside and explore the dark core of humanity. Ripley could be any of us, and this is frightening. Minghella has given us deliciously, but frightfully, incisive look at ourselves. Highly recommended, but not to be watched casually.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
451,andreasaraouzos,"Vision, Art and Talent",9,25 January 2003,"I read Patricia Highsmith's novel before I watched the film (in fact I was just in time!), not because `the book is always better than the movie' (I am not in favour of such generalisations), but because I felt obliged to be chronologically correct in following the artistic adaptation. Trying it the other way around can only make sense if you can be objective enough or unbiased.Artistic genius is what I'd call Anthony Minghella, who adapted and directed for the screen the latest masterpiece The Talented Mr Ripley. This 1955 novel is Highsmith's first of a number of Ripley stories. Needless to say, after the success of this screen adaptation, the others will follow, however with a different cast and crew and hence, in my opinion, with doubtful success to come. The Talented Mr Ripley is a novel dipped in dense psychology and intriguing human interaction. It is the journey of the aspiring young man Thomas Ripley around Italy and his deceitful engagements brought about by the ---ironically- innocent desire of happiness. The reader is immersed in the raw psychological reality that is sometimes frightfully familiar to all. Admiration, desire, jealousy, hatred, lies. the never-ending change of environment and circumstances, and yet the ever-stable personal fixations, traumas and needs. Thomas Ripley is not to be despised. And although he surely does not provide the example to follow, he is occasionally to be identified with.How masterfully Minghella has simplified the story without losing any density, and in fact making the whole picture better defined than in the book, should be a screenplay adaptation teaching example. A novelist has the enormous advantage of 'psychographic' elaboration and exploration, and Highsmith most certainly excelled in delivering Tom's complex portrait. But then Minghella took advantage of film imagery and dialogue and never lost the complexity and tension of any character, even with economised plot events, which are, in fact, appreciated. Additions and changes such as the impersonation of Herbert Greenleaf, the saxophone instead of painting, the characters of Meredith and Peter, and many more, were really assets to the story on screen. Now, on the slightly negative side, the film suffers the same thing that the book does (unavoidably). That is how the audience (or reader) excitement declines in the second half. Police interrogation and `factual proceedings' in the second half replace a lot of captivating character interaction in a most beautiful environment in the first half. And I did prefer the book's ending. It leaves you with enough question marks for the evening (in cases like myself for the week) but not too many on the other hand, like the film does.The subtlety of the homosexuality element in both film and book is skilfully real and it is only optional whether that is an issue taking priority in the whole picture or not. Finally what I found very interesting, but not necessarily agreeable, was the transformation of the Tom-Marge relationship. The loathing-turned-into-sympathy of the book is entirely reversed in the film. I found the book's version more enjoyable. As for the Marge-Dickie relationship, the book's rather platonic version is more interesting and uniquely real, but I guess the constraints of cinema in terms of audience attraction and box-office performance are too risky to ignore.
The verdict: A very good book and a brilliant adaptation. Matt Damon's weak, innocent and perplexed Ripley is a thriving achievement, Jude Law shines in a most convincing manner, Gwyneth Paltrow always looks fabulous as the tortured victim and Cate Blanchett is simply a delight to watch in all respects. Music and cinematography are beautiful. There is simply no flaw in the cast or production team of The Talented Mr Ripley.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
452,GeirSk,Looking serious while flirting with the superficial,5,23 March 2005,"It's slow in the beginning, but gets interesting after a while. The story didn't take the turns I expected. The acting is very good, the scenery is beautiful, but at the end of the day I was still left wondering whether this was a drama changed into a thriller, whether it was a thriller with a real message or a bizarre story placed in beautiful surroundings, well told.There are clear themes surfacing at different points: does being rich lead cruelty or superficiality, can being false work in the long run, is being what others require a real ground for friendship, does love have to be perfect to go deep? During the film these questions and more turn up, with the character of Tom Ripley as the focal point. However, at the end I was still unsure if the point this film made was really true and with a sense that all the drama surrounding it might cloud the real issues, leaving the film looking deep but only being so in certain strong moments.It's worth watching, but don't be surprised if you're bored at some points, touched at others, entertained but also a bit dizzy when it's done.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
453,mpbyrne-49953,A finely crafted and thoroughly entertaining psychodrama/thriller.,7,20 March 2017,"The Talented Mr. Ripley, adapted from Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel is a fairly unique and delightfully poignant character study of a young underachiever who is in search of an identity as much as he is of in success. This film delicately explores his relationship with an almost disaffected yet charmingly charismatic playboy and his fiancé, and how Tom Ripley, portrayed by a young, charming and genial Matt Damon. Tom Ridley is a remarkably unique character in the sense that he plays an almost anti-hero character longing for compassion, but is unable come to terms with himself and seems to doomed to constantly hide in the shadows of others until he manages to blot of their shadows with his own. I do not want to give away to actual events of the film as they unfold in a satisfyingly timely manner, relying entirely on Damon's character to scheme, manipulate and impersonate his way to innocence after his relationship with the aforementioned couple takes an interesting term. I can tell you that The Talented Mr. Ripley is a well-made film full of strong performances, interesting sets, and intimate dialogues. It's pacing is relatively slow at times, but during those moments you feel like you are thoroughly engaged with Mr. Ripley and his associates, and the suspense and mystery that comes all the more richly after the fine character developments and the intriguing multitude of emotions the strangely likable yet comparably vile characters(with the exception of the woman) experience. Overall, this film is certainly worth watching and kept my eyes fixed to the screen for the full 130 minutes.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The film succeeds on almost every level (except for the fact that there are a few moments where it does drag a *little* bit; it's 2hrs, 10min, but this is a minor complaint, this film is still a 10/10 on my scale)... a lot of visual and auditory symbolism and plenty of mind-candy to keep you thinking.  It starts out with the best of intentions, or so you think, and you have no clue as to the depths of Matt Damon's character until you start seeing how deeply he digs himself and how it seems there is no way to escape from what he has created for himself.  It is fascinating to see the character's ""fall from grace"", and the ending is superb in it's scope and directorial execution.  I want to go see it again.

I did however, think that Matt Damon's characterization of Ripley was not as deep or as complex as it could have been, but I do believe this is the fault of the script and lack of exposition and background on Ripley, and not the fault of the actor.  It is obvious that Matt did the absolute best he could with what was available to work with.

The story is slow, but it keeps you interested because you keep waiting to see what Damon does next, and if he will get caught.  However, after 2 1/2 hours it just ends!!!  It claimed to be a Hitchcock like mystery, and it was doing a heck of a job as a slow character study, but there is not payoff for the mystery itself.  You can assume many things, but all of the classics at least let you know what happened to the character, no matter how twisted he or she was.  This just ends.  Very, very frustrating, and that let down is what you walk out with.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

460,JayViolet,An interesting beginning that ended in disappointment,3,2 January 2000,"The first half of this movie was somewhat interesting.  You sit and wait for something, anything, interesting to happen and this movie does not fulfill any expectations you may have.  It is a slow-moving and dull 2 and 1/2 hours of waiting for the big bang.  The beginning part was interesting...we delve into the life of Tom Ripley, a man who is so unsatisfied with being simply ordinary that he takes on a job that will offer him the chance of adventure. Matt Damon is good in the role as Tom.  But we can never learn why he is the way he is or why the ending offered no sense of closure.  Gwyneth Paltrow is okay as Marge but spends the last half of the movie in hysterics. Jude Law did a fine job as Dickie Greenleaf but that was in the first half of the movie (the better half).  Overall,  ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" was a disappointment.  Expecting thrills and a fast-paced film, what was seen was an overdrawn and dull film.  Don't pay the $9.

What I got was a fumbling, detached liar who barely gets away with hurting other people.  I've heard Ebert and others say it is fascinating to watch the development of Ripley.  I guess I don't find it fascinating to watch the development of a pathetic nutcase! Considering I often root for the villain to prevail (in movies) it's odd for me to hear that others were sympathetic with Ripley, since I really wasn't, especially by the end.On the positive side, the movie is gorgeous, and the acting is top-notch.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
463,Bliss-10,The one and only BEST FILM of '99,10,27 December 1999,"Anthony Minghella's amazing adaptation takes a competent thriller and explores the inner mechanics of this rather conventional genre, turning Ripley into a fascinating and unforgettable character study. Depth is a good thing, my friends, even at the expense of convention. My god, especially at the expense of convention. From the opening shots we are visually informed that this is the story of a man in a psychological prison, and every element of the work reveals this man's mangled inner life. Minghella's hand is revealed early on when an affluent upperclass married couple mistake Tom Ripley for one of them, by his Princeton jacket (borrowed) and the girl on his arm (likewise), establishing an air of assumption that underlines the ensuing con game, suitably set in the terrain of 50's stereotyping. As a gay guy, I can tell you that this depiction of a maligned, self-destructive, deceptive closeted gay man exactly captures the delirious double identity mind games, unrequited affection and emotional murder that homosexual repression necessitates. This is a story of a closet-case who is so malformed from smothering his natural impulses, that even when he finds freedom he destroys it. Gay serial killers are a cliche in cinema, here the cliche is examined and laid bare for all its psychological truth and in the process becomes metaphorical. We are all watching the world from one kind of closet or another, we can see wholeness ahead of us, and yet we know that complete happiness eludes us. You know the natural grace inside, but what do you show the world? Life is a mask, an impersonation of heart's desire. The entire film is about who Ripley is inside - when you realize this, every single moment is essential and perfect and brilliantly realized by phenomenal Matt Damon. The gay stigma is the controversy here, audiences I saw it with giggled and spouted homophobic dismay at any suggestive scene. How disappointing. Beyond the barbarism of their wholly unfounded gay prejudice however, in clear light this film remains a shining memorial to film craft in every aspect and whole-heartedly deserves the Academy's Best Picture, Director, and Actor awards.

In a way, this film is a thematic combination of Matt Damon and Jude Law's best films, Good Will Hunting and Gattaca, respectively.  In the former, as Will, Matt Damon is alone in his search for love and identity.  He is lost and afraid which is why he acts up, and violently at times.  In the latter, Jude Law lends his life and gives his dream to Ethan Hawke.  Living someone else's life is what Hawke does; Damon does the same in this film as Dickie, although his alter ego doesn't volunteer to give him this life, he steals it.  Anyway, the film is suspenseful, shocking, and disturbing at the end.

Any cop would have noticed the put-on, and a private detective who uncovers everything but the truth?  I don't think so.  Minghella knows how to please our eyes, but he picked the wrong script to please our minds.

474,Necro56-3,My Review of The Talented Mr. Ripley,8,1 January 2000,"There have been only a couple of movie villains worth remembering. The legendary Goldfinger, from the Bond movie ""Goldfinger"". Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho"" could be another, if you consider him a villain. But when someone mentions Matt Damon, you don't really picture him being a memorable villain in a movie. That is, until you've seen The Talented Mr. Ripley.The Talented Mr. Ripley begins when Tom Ripley (Matt Damon in his best performance yet), borrows a Princeton blazer to play piano at a rooftop party in Manhattan. Tom tells us in a monolog that the whole thing started with the borrowing of the blazer, and he's right. A rich couple see Tom wearing the blazer and assume that since he supposedly went to Princeton, that he must know their son, Dickie Greenleaf. Tom agrees with them with them on this.The couple are concerned about their son, Dickie, who has moved to Europe and doesn't plan on coming back home. The father of Dickie, Mr. Greenleaf makes a deal with Tom Ripley: They will pay him $1,000 if he can bring their son back from Europe. They will even finance his trip to Europe.Once Tom arrives in Europe, he meets Dickie and his girlfriend, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow). Dickie doesn't remember Tom from Princeton, but he accepts him anyway. It is apparent early on in the movie that Tom wants to ""be"" Dickie Greenleaf. His talent is that he can impersonate just about anyone, from their voice, down to their signature. In an early scene in the movie, Dickie asks Tom what his talents are, Tom replies: Forging signatures, telling lies and impersonating almost anyone.Tom then proceeds to tell Dickie why he has come to Europe. Dickie does not want to go back to America, instead, he and Tom become best friends, or ""brothers"", they start to do things together every day. Then comes along a friend of Dickie's named Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Tom notices that Freddie has come between him and Dickie. That is the furthest I will go into the plot, so I don't spoil anything that I already haven't.The movie works for several reasons. First of all, everyone in the movie gives excellent performances. Even pretty boy Matt Damon, who I could never see as a villain, does a remarkable job of being creepy in his role as Tom Ripley. Gwyneth Paltrow gives another great performance to follow her last one in ""Shakespeare in Love"". The movie is also very entertaining at times, and at some parts, even has you rooting for Tom Ripley, the villain of the movie. I really liked some of the scenes in the movie where someone had almost found out that something was ""up"" with Tom Ripley. I also really liked the ending to the whole movie. But, for every good scene, there was a scene that was too drawn out. It seemed like some of the scenes didn't need to be in the movie. That is really the only complaint I have with it.I think in a few years, Matt Damon's performance will be looked upon as a memorable villain in a movie. We are rooting for him throughout most of the movie. Sometimes I even forgot that he was suppose to be the villain. Maybe its because his performance is so damn good, that I was convinced that he was evil.Overall I think the movie is good, if not the masterpiece that it could have been.

This movie never even came close.  At times during the movie, it was more interesting to watch the people in front of me than the screen. Don't get me wrong, the script could have been made into an excellent movie, but the director seemed more interested in making you feel sorry for people than concentrating on the main plot.  At 3 hours, it was incomprehensibly long, and could have been easily trimmed to 1:45.  I honestly think that a lot of people went to see this movie without thinking about it first.

It is a disturbing and rather intense work of art. Especially that of the actors. I would dare say that if one sits and grasps the film dialogue and the images, they have to consider the fearful display of emotion, ignorance, love, hate, etc.. This film delves into the heart of that nature and if one does not find semblance to reality itself, one has destroyed the sensitivity of truth to emotion itself. This film is not for the faint-hearted and confused. It is to analyze yet make one think. It has to for what is the intention behind film. I shall not impose but I feel all should consider watching the film yet I find so many throwing rocks already.

Nothing happened at all, NOTHING.  The beginning was slightly interesting, but at that point I was not completely jaded by the endless and pointless banter they try and pass for dialogue.  The biggest flaw of the film is the lack of any real action occuring.  People are killed, but it never feels satisfying.  I don't mind a lot of dialogue if it is interesting, but this just isn't.  Watch ""American Beauty"" and then watch TMR to see my point. On this basis I had already concluded that TMR was the most worthless piece of film-making in a long time, but it doesn't stop there.  I beg you not to see this film, it is just BAD.  If you do go, though, I'm sure you will get a chuckle out of the numerous gay scenes in the movie featuring Matt Damon. He can be seen bathing with his friend, cuddling with a dead body, and finally cuddling with his new male friend while they have a deep discussion. These scenes were the only amusing thing in the movie and are great for a few chuckles.  Enjoy!",The Talented Mr. Ripley
485,goofy7,Wonderful movie with wonderful acting,10,24 February 2000,"This is just an AWESOME movie.  The acting is superb, especially that of Matt Damon.  The plot of this movie is so complex and intriguing, and the weird thing is that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy (I least I did).

486,robinsonf,A fine ensemble performance by a winning cast,10,24 February 2000,"First of all, I saw this movie twice, which is a rarety in itself these days.  The actors did what all actors should do in a successful motion picture, or stage play, and that is submit their own egos to the needs of the production.  Matt Damon especially surprised me with his total devotion to the part of Ripley.  Jude Law, once again, proved his talents as an actor by becoming Dickie Greenleaf.  Paltrow and Blanchett also totally believed in whom they were playing and brought that to the screen.  While I have been told that the movie is different than the book, I applaud Mingella for his tight script and seamless direction.  Yet again, we are given a prime example that when violence grows out of a strong plot we, as an audience, accept it.  There was not wasted motion or emotion in this film and I cannot say enough good things about it.  I am surprised that the Academy so overlooked this film.  Go see it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Because I have not read the book I cannot say which film is closer to the novel. The homosexuality is completely left out of the first one. Perhaps this is because of the time the film was made but the story misses nothing. It is even better without this part.WARNING possible spoiler!In the older version Ripley kills Greenleaf to get his comfortable life consisting of his money and the beautiful Marge. His driving force is envy. In the newer version Ripley is plotting on Greenleaf and plays his role even before he meets him. But when he kills him it is because Greenleaf does not answer to his homosexual approaches. This great difference makes the two movies to have very different plots and only some main events in common. The newer one is more complicated in the end and the plot always gives the impression to be constructed while the older one is much more convincing. The older version is better, but this one is not bad at all.6/10",The Talented Mr. Ripley

This movie heavily uses the spiraling lie tactic.  The movie is very slow to start, has fabulous scenery, good acting and great cinematography.

I've read all 5 books by Patricia Highsmith and loved them all. The character Tom Ripley intriques me. I like to think of the Talented Mr. Ripley movie as a totally different story all together since it's so different from the book's version. IMDB doesn't recommend commenting on other commentors but I'd just like to add that you shouldn't compare this movie to modern times as the 50's were very different.I thought this movie was superb, one of my favorites. The soundtrack is brilliant. I can't wait for Ripley's Game (with John Malkovitch) to come out in October and Ripley Underground also 2002.If you've read Ripley's Game there's also a German Film made in the 70s with Dennis Hopper as Ripley and Bruno Ganz as Jonathan.

This is the first DVD I rented that I disliked so intensely that I did not even watch the special features.  It is one of those rare movies that leaves a bad taste in your mouth when the credits roll.This movie is so full of scenes that jump up and down and say ""look at me, I'm a plot contrivance"" that you will be completely exasperated before it's over.  Perhaps if the characterizations were more consistent some of the glaring plot holes and annoyances could be ignored.  The odd thing is the acting is not bad (it is, after all, a very strong cast), the actors are just written into corners that no amount of good acting can overcome. Also, I've never seen the gifted Cate Blanchett given so little to do and so wasted.All the characters are unlikable, either for their behavior or dim-wittedness, and the plot is not clever enough (even though it screams over and over again ""look how clever I am!"") to make up for it.

One hour into this movie and I wanted to end the movie.  But I sat through it and unmercifully,  it last over 2 hours!  Matt Damon is a great actor,  and he played the part very well,  but the rest of this movie was horrible.  The story was ridiculous, the acting other than Damon was below average and I could not keep up with it because it was jumping all over the place.  Matt Damon is Tom Ripley, a master of impersonations and forging signatures.   He pretends to be a student at Princeton and then gets into a situation where a fellow Princeton members father asks him to go to italy and bring his son back.   To make a long story short,  and believe me this is a LONG story....Tom goes to Italy and gets close to this Princeton member named Dickie.

I will not tire you with comments about the characters or the plot but I will say this: Near the end I couldn't tear my eyes away and at the same had the strongest urge to hit the stop button so I wouldn't watch it anymore.

Who cares about any of these people, except maybe Marge? And therein lies the missed opportunity. This film should have been written from Marge's point of view, not Tom's.

The only thing that this movie did for me was to make me feel sick and wonder what has happened to our society. Some movies are dark by nature in order to have the viewer try to identify with or have compassion for someone or something. I am sure there are people that are like Mr. Ripley, but they should be locked away. Hollywood portrayed such a demented character in such a way that they tried to make him look acceptable. It is movies like this that allow people that are very impressionable to commit crimes that otherwise would not have been committed.

I liked how the movie started, the first half was more interesting for me. Some twists in the plots that were not predictable.The movie then exposes Ripley as a bad person (even rotten), who would not think twice when it comes to eliminating anything in his way when he is threatened. He is impulsive and violent and above all, stupid. *Spoiler* How can you kill and pretend you did not do it? Why did you stay in the same country after you did it. And every time when things go back on track, he still stays around not thinking that there are still some people that may recognize him. The first kill was impulsive, the following kills were less impulsive, the later kills were not impulsive at all, it is just plain evil.I liked everything else about the movie except for Ripley's character. The fact that some people liked the movie, maybe means that Mr. Ripley is an OK guy and it was good that he keeps getting away.

503,jpetko01,"Superb acting is what makes this movie a ""perfect"" 8.",8,17 May 2013,"A great example of how movie can be interesting and can involve you and leave you thinking without any special effects, without great script or plot... Lets face it, this movies doesn't have great script, it doesn't have great plot either. Movie plot is interesting and definitely can involve you, yet it is not a breathtaking story with many twists and turns. But there is one thing that makes this movie great, and it is acting. Because of acting this movie is breathtaking an involving and represents one great experience and one hell of a ride.Each character is important, each character is there for a reason and can't be left out. The way Matt Damon carried out his role made me speechless, his acting is superb, at times you can relate to him and feel sorry for poor underachiever Tom Ripley, but then, just moment later he gives you chills and scares you as hell. He's a beauty and a beast in one. And it's not only because of his role, in fact it's mostly because of the way he carried out his role. Jude Law gave the performance without a flaw. Moreover his acting is perfect. He embodied young playboy and adventurer so good that we all could feel what is like to be Dickie Greenleaf even for a moment, singing and drinking in jazz club in Naples or sun tanning and picking up girls on the sand beaches of Mongibello. Other actors were superb too, maybe only Gwyneth Paltrow had some, not bad, but less good moments in movie, but all in all it is a flawless acting.To sum up all characters were played by perfect actors for that role, and when that happens movie can't be bad, indeed, it will probably be as great as this one.There aren't many movies which made me relate to every one of the main characters, good or bad, and for that I give this movie 8 out of 10. To be a 9 or a perfect 10 any movie should have something in addition to perfect acting, such things as extraordinary special effects, mind blowing twists or exceptional plot. In lack of those i give ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" a ""perfect"" 8.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

I had in my mind all the hype from when it was released (Minghella had had recent success with The English Patient) so settled down to watch with anticipation. All throughout this film I was expecting something to happen but it never did. Sure there were some tense - ish moments when there may have been a possibility of Ripley being found out but they came and went quite quickly.The ending was very much a great let down and although it may have been shot like that to provoke thought for the viewer i'm afraid the only thought it provoked in me was ""ay?"".

506,Michael_0036,Perfection,10,13 February 2005,"I recently caught this wonderful film on television, and was delighted to re-visit this almost perfect example of film making. Everything about the film, including Minghella's flawless direction, the breathtaking cinematography and a razor sharp script, combine to form an unforgettable movie experience.Minghella expertly tells a tale that is an equal mix of drama and suspense. It focuses on one chapter in the life of Tom Ripley - A man who, at this stage in the Highsmith novels anyway, is a nobody who yearns for a life better than his own. Opportunity knocks when a case of mistaken identity results in Tom being sent to Italy to bring back Dickie Greenleaf, a rich and spoilt playboy living in the lap of luxury. However, while in Italy, Tom realises that the lifestyle Dickie leads is something that he has long desired. When Dickie tires of Tom's presence, and throws him aside like many other people in the past, disaster strikes, and Tom assumes Dickie's identity...with tragic consequences for all involved.The acting in particular warrants particular attention; Matt Damon gives an incredibly intuitive and multi-layered performance as the conflicted yet driven character of Tom Ripley. Gwyneth Paltrow gives what has to be the most under-rated performance of her career - watching the character of Marge evolve from a care free young lady into a suspicious and eventually terrified victim is breathtaking. Jude Law and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are also perfectly cast and do not disappoint in vital roles.If you have not seen this film already, get it out as a weekly rental at the video store. I can guarantee it will not disappoint. Even film goers that are not fans of this type of genre will still be impressed by the caliber of film-making up there on the television screen.5 out of 5 stars.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
507,catlneedham,Tommmyyyy...How's the Peeping? One of PSH's BEST roles ever!,10,7 February 2014,"So much to love about this movie. From the beautiful locations to the totally accurate glimpse of WASP society, ending finally on just how frightening a bland smile and obsequious nature can be, this film has it all. Great acting by Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Matt Damon.But the best role of all, in my opinion, is the small supporting role played masterfully by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The way he played his character, Freddie Miles, is perfect-- a condescending, jaded, supercilious preppy who has seen (and probably) done it all. Freddie is supremely bored, cynical, and has a real mean streak. When he focuses his golden laser beam of ridicule onto Tom Ripley (Damon), you realize right away (as does Ripley) that the jig is, if not up, then threatened. I squirmed with delicious discomfort whenever Freddie taunts Ripley--my favorite being ""Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, How's the peeping?"" and of course the best line of all, ""I think I'm SAYING it"". Superb.Philip Seymour Hoffman was an absolute genius and never overplayed or hit a false acting note in anything I've ever seen him in. I don't usually feel anything when a celebrity dies more than ""Oh, that's too bad/weird/expected."" When I learned of his death, however, it actually hurt inside. All that great acting we'll never see again.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
508,hrafn-2,"A sumptuous, haunting, disturbing and beautiful film",10,21 July 2005,"I was prepared not to like this film. I'd been told it was only worth watching for the character of Peter Smith-Kingsley, who appears quite briefly towards the end, and that I should probably fast forward through the rest. However, it turned out that I was intrigued, entertained and captivated right from the start.I thought the whole 'is there anything real in there at all?' aspect of Tom Ripley was fabulously done. You do simultaneously believe that Tom is an innocent, loving young man who's swept up in a terrible chain of events that he never planned, sparked off by a completely understandable crime of passion, and also that Tom is a cold hearted, lying git who's so good at pretending to be what other people want him to be that there's nothing real about him at all.Before seeing this film I had no time for Matt Damon or Jude Law, but I was astonished to find both were really good actors. Matt Damon deserves great kudos for being both completely transparent and impenetrable; both open and artless, and also kind of creepy and inhuman. I've never liked Jude Law before, and his character in this one was a bit of a bastard, but as the glamorous golden boy that everyone wants to be with, who they don't see is really quite selfish and dangerous until too late, I thought he was very convincing.I admit that you could have taken the women out of the film and I wouldn't have noticed. And yes it seems unlikely that Ripley could really have got away with it for so long, but that adds to the claustrophobic sense of entanglement around Ripley's character - the sense that there really isn't a way out.I know that people have complained about the ending, but to me it was perfect. Ripley's descent into evil began when he was rejected and mocked by a man he loved who turned out to hate him in return. It was a human, understandable crime of passion for which we could forgive him. He then killed again, but the man he killed was obnoxious, and it was a clear case of self defence - less understandable, less innocent, but still sympathetic.But he has now got into the habit of getting rid of people who are in his way, and at the end he reaches his nadir. Having found the one person you feel he is able to be honest with, able to be himself with, having found a love that appears to offer him redemption - an innocent, trusting young man - he murders him in cold blood, on the off chance that it might solve his identity problems.It doesn't essentially matter what happens now - he was offered redemption but there wasn't enough left of him to take it. Whether he's caught or not, he has finally fallen all the way and there's no way back for him. Finding out whether he was caught or not is really irrelevant, and I don't understand why people get hung up about it. It could not have ended better.And the beauty of it! Gorgeous scenery, fantastic music - it's a feast for the senses. It's been haunting me ever since.Matt Damon and Jude Law have had their share of praise in other reviews, so I'll just finish by saying that Jack Davenport plays Peter Smith-Kingsley as the sweetest thing you ever imagined. In a film whose critics have accused it of perpetuating the 'evil gay psychopath' trope, people seem to have missed the way Davenport plays a gay man who is warm, dignified, gentle, and the only fully likable person in the whole film. Peter would have been worth watching the film for on his own, if it hadn't actually been fascinating in itself.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
509,rvoste,cat and mouse chase for a hidden-in-plain-sight gay guy,8,25 February 2021,"Behind a front layer of being a psychological thriller there's really just a fun Catch Me If You Can type situation going in this movie.The plot outline of this movie reminds a lot of an opera. It has all the melodrama, the love, the murder, the farce, the tension between low and high society, the characters disguising themselves as each other. It's great.But it's a lot more emotionally nuanced than just that. You're always guessing for what people know and don't know, trying to tell by their behaviour. This can only be accomplished with firmly above-average acting performances.What I appreciated about the movie as well were some deliberately odd direction choices that accentuated the main character's bewildered mental state.There's a cute gay couple in here, but the movie plays around a little too much with the queer psycho trope. The main character really isn't as creepy as the movie implies (at least not to me). He's more a tragic hero than an anti-hero in my book, performing desperate acts to get out desperate situations.Didn't like the ending. Felt unnecessary.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
510,PEDRichards,Compelling if Pessimistic Portrait of the Human Psyche and Society,6,11 August 2019,"It may be true that many viewers will focus primarily on the fate of Tom Ripley, the lead character, yet what would be most compelling about the film's mood, along with its plot, would be the Hellish realities of society that contribute to the perpetuation of Tom's freedom, and success. Tom Ripley is an ingratiating figure who develops an infatuation with one Dickie Greenleaf, after being sent on a mission to convince Dickie to return to America, from a sojourn in Italy, by Dickie's father. Hence, the entire film is predicated by, first, the borrowing of a Princeton jacket by Tom, and secondly, by Tom's adept piano-playing, the two of which, together, provide a link between Tom and Dickie and instill confidence, that will remain unshaken, as the film progresses, about Ripley's trustworthiness, in the elder Greenleaf.
The anonymity of not only being foreigners, but of the large cities in Italy where much of the plot transpires is what will allow Tom to impersonate the deceased Dickie in order to, for one thing, take possession of funds provided for Dickie's use by his father. This impersonation will also obscure clues regarding the unsolved death of another American, Freddie, for therefore Tom can become the prime suspect in the mysterious death of Freddie, before what appears to be a suicide note from Dickie surfaces.
There seem to be something like a plot-hole, as we don't see Marge telling Mr. Greenleaf nor Peter about her experience before Peter himself witnesses Tom cornering her against the exit doors with his hand hiding a razor in his bathrobe pocket. Whatever, Patricia Highsmith has said about Tom Ripley, and however she seems to have admired the character she created, such as for being subject to fate as we all are, whilst bolstering his chances at survival, Tom basically froclicks like a hog in the mud, throughout the novel. In this case, Peter's homosexuality seems to blind him to the truth, as he bandages up Tom's hand, after he prepared to stab Marge for discovering that he somehow inherited Dickie's rings, which Dickie swore to Marge he would never take off. We did see examples of how Mr. Greenleaf and Peter, along with Detective MCarron, would have dismissed Marge's protestations that Tom was guilty of foul-play. Stunningly, Mr. Greenleaf proceeds, after sending after his son an apparent peer of his who would, in a blind rage at being rejected in his amorous advances, would bludgeon him whilst he made the mistake of taking his eyes off him, with a paddle, decides to continue to provide bequests from his fortune to the murderer of his son. It's not clear if the elder Mr. Greenleaf is a homosexual himself, and that seems to have influenced, and clouded his vision, as it seems to have in Peter's case, or if he simply despises his son, for his son rejecting him, because society passed judgement on him, or due to some other cause.
It's true that Dickie Greenleaf can be said to have been characterized negatively. He pursues multiple women, and cheats on his girlfriend. He's less-than-an-angel, in short, although that hardly can be Tom's problem with Dickie, with whom he is clearly infatuated.
In a society, where attention is drawn and arguably most concentrated upon mass-shooters, it's interesting to consider a character like Tom Ripley whose creator seems to consider him to be empowered by his own ""talent"" and therefore beyond reproach, taking risks and dealing internally with his own regrets, which he had hoped to share with a confidant, which Tom had hoped would be Peter. If nothing else, the plot of 'The Talent Mr. Ripley' will remind some of us that villains come in all shapes and sizes, and that opportunism can allow persons' to hide a great deal about their pasts as well as their true natures.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
511,jossd23,"A beautiful film, not as stylish as Delon or as methodical as the book but beautiful, beautiful",9,16 January 2006,"I saw the Alain Delon film a year or two before the Damon film came out in 1999. To me at the time, a young film addict, it was an amazing film. My initial thought after it finished was that if i ever could make a film i would remake this one. When i was sitting at a bus stop in Perth faced to face with a poster of Damon under the title 'The Talented Mr Ripley' i was unimpressed. I missed my chance i felt and i decided not to pay any attention to the film, and not to see it. Years later when i was with Shazrina my closest friend i found out she had a Jude Law obsession, an actor who i had not really watched much. She referred to him in Ripley as being a Bronzed God. At this point i had grown an affinity for Damon as well, after re-watching Good will Hunting, Oceans etc.. so i decided to bite the bullet and watch The Talented Mr Ripley. The first thing i liked was the music, the switching back and forth from the jazz and whimsical score to the sadder notes, the darker shadows of the score. I didn't watch the film expecting to see a remake of the Delon film, i knew that this film played Tom as gay unlike the Delon film so i expected it to follow a different set of triggers. I loved the colors in the film... it is a beautifully filmed picture, just like the Delon film, but where Delon is always alone and always expects to be alone Damon try's to be a part of something but fails. To me both movies tell only half of the motivation of Tom Ripley as told in the Highsmith novel. I really enjoy re-watching The Talented Mr Ripley because of its beautiful locations, grand music and well acted characters (but i still fell like an observer unlike the Delon film where while watching you almost become Delon). But this movie was made to be observed, certainly the killing of Dickie and the tension of the continuous escapes by Tom are captivating and well done, but i watch it every time for its beauty. (If it wasn't made meant to be watched for its beauty then why cast Jude Law, huh Shaz?) It's strange to find a murder film that you can relax to. The beauty does tend to over run the film at times. Having said that, one of the best scenes in the film is where the two main characters are in the forefront- when Tom kills Dickie. The camera is a close up shot and the beautiful background is actually pushed to the back.. here we finally see what Dickie feels about Tom and we see what type of a person Tom really is.. its important that we see nothing but the characters and the use of eliminating the beautiful background is done well, if only for a moment.The thing i like about the Ripley story is that despite how beautiful everything looks non of the characters are perfect... Marge is too needy, Dickie is too selfish and Tom is homicidal. There is so much more to say about this and the Delon film, they are both great films but they speak differently, arouse different feelings and reactions. To me neither are exactly like the book so the prospect of making the film again is a possibility for this once upon a time film addict. (though the film means more to me for different reasons..), if you want to watch a stunningly beautiful film with relaxing music and interesting characters, a bit of tension thrown into the mix and you don't want it to be a foreign film or a merchant ivory production than this is your film. To make the film more enjoyable try speaking with Jude Laws fake American Accent for the rest of the day, its fun, try it! 'Marge, Marge! You've got to hear this!'",The Talented Mr. Ripley
512,AFPHS,Too long...,5,29 December 1999,"This movie should have been over 20 minutes after he killed guy #1 (I'm not going to say who killed who). It was nice to see the director develop Tom Ripley into his ""counter-character"", but it was just too drawn out. Even some of the events in the beginning should have been thinned out a bit. The plot was interesting, it was a strong cast, the directing was wonderful, Matt Damon and Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow were awesome, but the movie was too drawn out. I almost got sick of it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
513,DarthRob,Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,1,23 January 2000,"Movies this bad can't have been made by accident. To make every aspect of a movie terrible takes talent (though why one would wish to go out of their way to pursue such a talent eludes me), and it appears the director has such talent. I have been somewhat of a fan of Matt Damon- who didn't like Good Will Hunting?- but I guess everyone has their bad films. Not that he's bad...it doesn't seem he had much to work with. Mr. Damon plays a homicidal sociopathic leach of a human being with a talent for scamming his way through life. He's a sad case...such a sad case that watching this spineless psycho destroy every life around him made me sympathetic for Alex in A Clockwork Orange. The only reason I kept my eyes open and stayed in the theater during this excruciating pain was because I kept saying to myself, ""This can't get any worse."" The director tries to get us to feel sorry for this little whelp. We see his ""sensitive"" side, his locked basement full of demons that he kept trying to give out the key for. This only made me want to vomit even more. I'm kind of Mr. Ripley's violent nature was shown the way it was, because real violence is quite ugly. That doesn't mean you'd like to pay $7 to see it, however. We see all the malice, all the crudeness of it, and the child killing because things aren't going his way, and all of a sudden you wish you weren't there, which is counter to the nature of the art. Definitely a disappointment. Every scene seems way too long, every conversation drawn out. I thought it might get better when I saw Philip Baker Hall (Hard Eight!), but even he seemed to be squirming in an uncomfortable role. Maybe I shouldn't be slamming this movie so hard...it might be better for you to see it's filth for yourself. That, however, would pour a good deal of money into a horrible film, and I think it's crappy that they put Matt Damon in it so every female teen in America would go see it. If you ever feel the erge, decide in favor of being thrifty and put that money toward something worth while.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
514,Leeza-2,It was alright...,5,7 January 2000,"Ok...When I bought my ticket to go see ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" I expected ""..the best movie of the year.."" as many critics deemed it to be.  In my opinion, the movie would have been better if it was a tad shorter.  There were parts where I couldn't sit still in my seat from boredom.  The ending was awful.  On the other hand...it was suspenseful and thought-provoking. Matt Damon and Jude Law gave a great performance each and Gwyneth...well..she gave her regular Gwyneth Paltrow performance that is seen in every one of her movies...nothing special.  In the end...I DON'T think that this film deserves to win or even be nominated for best picture at the Golden Globes, the Oscars or anything else.  I was a little let down by this movie, because the trailer made it seem like it was the most amazing movie ever!

Doesn't anyone have an original idea?  I think it is trying to be an ""Andrew Cannon"" type mystery, but if the audience is privy to all of the information then it can't be a mystery. Just when you think this piece of garbage is over they throw another ""twist"" as if the audience cared about any one of the participants.  And it condones gay bashing.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
516,Oscar-57,Jude Law gives another outstanding performance,10,28 December 1999,"This is an old style murder mystery. The plot is NOT slow and PLENTY happens. Most of today's movies are made to bombard the senses. This movie appeals to the mind and requires an attention span beyond that of a two-year-old. In a movie full of excellent performances, Jude Law (Dickie Greenleaf) and Philip Seymour Hoffman (Freddie) stand out. Law, who has given outstanding performances before in ""Gattaca"" and ""Wilde"" deserves to be recognized for his performance in this excellent film. The audience is as likely to be suckered in by his character's charm as Tom Ripley. Even Gwyneth Paltrow, a highly overrated actress, gives an excellent performance. The film shines against the Italian background and the rhythms of the Jazz clubs that Dickie and Ripley frequent. When Oscar nominations come around, I hope to see this film heavily represented.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Later on, the various developments make you wonder when things started to get interesting. How could this guy foresee all he was going to do ?? The things he is capable of are near absurd, not in physical term, but in psychological ones. He really makes you wonder about the things you yourself would be capable of in turning your live around to what YOU want it to be. The end of the movie is not as challenging as it could have been, but still completes it to make the movie worth while.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
518,Arvid-2,"Great movie, with great acting and incredible sceneries.",8,14 April 2000,"I must say, when I went to see this movie I had high hopes for it. They were fulfilled. Matt Damon is very convincing as a man who wants to be a somebody instead of a nobody so bad that he is prepared to do anything to accomplish it. It really surprised me that he could pull this off. Gwyneth Paltrow is nothing out of the ordinary in this movie though, but Jude Law! What can I say? Personally I haven't seen one bad movie with him in it.Another side of this movie is the sceneries. On this point the movie has to become a classic. Seldom have I seen such breathtaking cinematography. It should have won an oscar. Some argue that this movie is too long. True, but if it were any shorter it couldn't have led to that ending, which I thought was brilliant. I felt very entertained, because it had a great plot and it wasn't nearly as predictable as most movies are today. I give it a 9.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
519,jesk,very good film that does not live up to the hype,8,31 December 1999,"This was easily the most anticipated movie of the Christmas season and it is Minghella's follow up to the English Patient.  Given those parameters, the movie fails to live up to either.  The movie is beautiful as are the actors, and Matt Damon and Phillip Seymour Hoffman turn in excellent performances. With this role, Damon has taken another step to becoming one of the finest actors around.  However, the movie does not provide the suspense it needs to keep you glued to it for the right reasons.  Instead of staring at the beautiful scenery or Gwynneth Paltrow and Jude Law, I wanted to be more involved in the story.  This movie is defintely one to see, but not the movie of the year as i feel American Beauty is.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

The book is a series of events, similar to the one shown, and helps the reader to better understand Tom Ripley's character and maybe even emphasize with him.  The film, on the other hand, does a poor job of summing up Tom's problems by showing one instance and then dragging it out for two and a half hours.  The audience does not have a clear understanding of Tom's character and becomes bored of the slow-paced film.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

522,nyr323,This was a horrible excuse for a movie starring Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow,1,15 January 2000,"This was the absolute worst movie that I have ever seen.  I found it to be extremely predictable and emotionally unbelievable.  The characters were impossible to relate to and the plot line was less than disappointing. Gwyneth Paltrow was the only bright part of the movie, though, although she had so little to work with.  Take my advice, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!

523,benwibble,Tries to be too clever,3,27 February 2000,"This is only the second film I have ever seen in a cinema that I have been tempted to walk out of.  The crying shame about The Talented Mr Ripley is that the first hour is so good.  The plot slowly develops, and watching Ripley's obsession with Dickie emerge is fascinating.The acting from all four main actors (Damon, Law, Paltrow, Blanchett) is impeccable, with Jude Law in particular playing his role extremely well.
(spoiler) Once Ripley is a wanted man, the rest of the film is spent waiting for him to be caught.  I counted SIX possible places where the film could have had a satisfactory ending, but the over-indulgent screenplay chooses to work through all of them.  This makes the film about an hour too long (there were cheers in the cinema when it ended).  My recommendation would be to go see this film, watch the first 90 minutes or so, which are great, and then leave, inventing your own ending.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

I sat squirming in my chair throughout the entire film, not from suspense or interest but from total boredom. This movie never took off, it just sat and sat and went on and on. The plot in my mind never developed enough to pull you into the movie. My wife and I sat in the theater asking one another repeatedly when it was going to end. This was positively the worst large scale film I have ever seen. I do not recommend for any one to see it in the theater nor would I waste money on the video.

I will be surprised if he is not recognized for his work here come Oscar time. The whole film is absolutely enthralling, and it kept me literally on the edge of my seat for more that half its length.

533,cgilman,"A poor, bloated adaptation, miscast and misdirected...",1,28 December 1999,"Having been a fan of the Ripley books for some years, I was hopeful that at last someone had made at least a watchable adaptation of the most intriguing sociopath in modern literature.  So much for hope...There was no point to the silly sub-plots, additional characters and various 'stuff' the film makers added to Highsmith's exceptionally elegant and sparse story.  Perhaps someone felt they had to 'improve' on Highsmith (yikes!) in order to justify their paycheck.  The effect is disastrous, making an interminable film longer than it needs to be.  Worse, now no one can have a whack at it again for 20 years or so!Matt Damon seems like he was willing to perform, but slid into being boring instead of being understated.  The characterization of Dickie as a playboy is unfortunate, but at least Jude Law shows signs of life.  Miss Paltrow's Marge is far too knowing, rather than puppet-like.  We are deprived of the uncomfortable sensation we feel in the book when she succumbs to Ripley's story.  Cate Blanchett does as best she can, with a character that never existed in print and isn't even needed for the film.Ripley is far more subtle than the over-baked re-telling given it by Minghella and Co. For example, why start him off living in abject poverty? Highsmith smartly had him already toying with an underground career when Mr. Greenleaf pursues him, knowing that he went to school with Dickie.  The Highsmith setup makes for a much more interesting 'acquaintance becomes a devil and takes over your life' dynamic.  Further bad choices are made concerning the coup de grace and ensuing action.  The demise of Dickie, THE CENTRAL MOMENT OF THE STORY, is awkwardly contrived, seeming to come from nowhere and feeling out of place rather than organic and plausible. Perhaps this is the consequence of the bad plot leads going before, and poor filmmaking choices that leave the film's texture uneven.Read the book instead.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
534,the_deadbeat,a dissenting view,1,29 December 1999,"be cautious, the following comment makes statements about theme, plot structure and mangled movie making.what does it say about a studio's/producer's/director's feeling for the work they have produced (not to mention the time and millions spent) when they do not take the time and effort to digitally (or otherwise) remove a visible boom-mic. from a shot not five minutes into the film? to me, it says that they don't care. generally, i do not care to post my opinions online, but felt compelled to with this movie. from a technical standpoint, it is a film haphazardly shot and lit without any notion of making it look good. it relies too heavily on the natural beauty of its italian backdrop. why do i dwell on the technical deficiencies? primarily because the story has little to offer. it reeks of self-indulgence, and compounding its slow pacing, long running time and meandering storyline one wonders whether a plot or editor were to be seen anywhere within the vicinity of this project. the one theme the film touches on, attitudes toward homosexuality in the middle of this century is not only glossed over, but is caricatured to the point of non-existence.making a murder movie a period piece and releasing it in december does not make it a serious movie.yuck.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
535,njchuck,All style but no substance,4,3 January 2000,"Here is my problem with the movie. But first, it is a great movie to look at visually. The cinematography is excellent and the locations are wonderful to see. And the story is good too. However, the problem is that the characters are a bore. I doubt that anyone really cares about the fate of Dickie or Tom (or Freddie or the Gwyneth Paltrow character). There is just no depth to any of the characters. I do not think this is the fault of the actors who were all as good as they could be. I don't think they had much to work with.  In a pivotal scene where the relationship changes between Dickie and Tom, the first half of the scene is excellent. Tom  is singing and dancing along with a recording. Enter Dickie...There could have been some major energy here but the scene just went flat and died. The scene started good but then nothing. Sort of like the entire movie.

I sat through the entire thing hoping that something would happen to make the movie entertaining, but all it did was have the same events happen over and over again with no resolution.  It built up a lot of tension, but never releases it.  I blame this solely on the screenwriter, because it was well directed, well acted, and the scenery and music were excellent, but the plot lacked.  I haven't read the book, and probably never read it now.  Even my friends (who like more dramatic movies than I do) were highly dissapointed.  The trailer was very misleading in the fact that this movie is not suspenseful in the least as there is no real mystery to what is going on.

On the outside he appears so wholesome and harmless but if you watch his eyes, they can give you a chill. And I must say that Jude Law, an actor I had not seen much of before I saw this film, also gave a great performance.  He has great charm and you can almost understand why ""Mr. Ripley"" would go to such great lengths to possess his life.

Some might feel that it is too long (and justifiably so) but it is necessary to illustrate that this is the life that Tom Ripley will lead forever and that he has led even before the movie started.  At the beginning, you give him the benefit of the doubt because you don't know him, but at the end you of the movie, you realize why you don't know him, because you have seen Ripley at all, but various manifestations of those he has come in contact with during his life.This is a performance that sets Matt Damon apart.  He was flawless as Ripley, no easy task.  I also enjoyed Jude Law in his role as the spoiled and irresponsible socialite.  He is both likable and unsympathetic.

The movie should have ended about five times before the final scene, (it would have been less boring), but it felt like the editor forgot to edit out the 4 other possible endings and just left everything in.  I suppose that's what they mean by ""thinking man's movie"".  What this movie did make me think about is that everyone in the 50's, with the exception of our tragic hero, were just a bunch of gullible, overly nice simpletons that accepted everything at face value without question, and when someone actually does figure out the big graft, they are labeled crazy and emotionally distraught.One last tidbit that frustrated me with this movie.  One lucky plot twist, where the main character gets out of a situation by a stroke of luck is one thing, but six or seven?!!!  That drove me nuts more than anything.  When that happens, it usually means the movie is priming everything for a good comeuppance, but there wasn't even that satisfaction!  The acting was good, but the script was horrible.

The first time I found her shallow and irritating, but that was the character. The fun part was watching how she did it.

Purists will complain about the additional characters, but the meaning is still the same: how much capacity do we human beings have to do what in isolation might be considered awful things because we are not loved?This film poses dark questions about the human condition. And comes up with a disconcerting answer: that in some circumstances a crime might be logical and understandable.And so I left the movie with a deep sympathy for a character although no sympathy for his crime. And that is unsettling because how can one be sympathetic for someone who commits such evil?Minghella has produced a masterpiece of filmwork and music, with the haunting opening theme with Sinead O'Connor's haunting rendition of ""Lullaby for Cain"", progressing through the rich visual splendour of Italy, and producing a narative of such genius that the story itself flows like the movements of a symphony.My Verdict: True Genius.

Initially the slow decent into evil is interesting and the cast holds up. Unfortunately the plot is as manipulative as any hollywood junk and before you know it youre being led through 2 hours of the ups and downs of predictable murders and narrow escapes. There's not really much reason to like anyone in this besides Phillip Seymour Hoffman's smarmy side character.Also, the old saw of the one character that knows the truth (Paltrow) is used. Why must the movie going population be forced to relive this hackneyed device? To top it all off towards the end theres a syrupy psuedo-psychological explanation of why poor my ripley is the way he is.People also make a big deal about the 'scenery'. Shooting a movie in a beautiful place doesn't translate to good cinematography, which is not remarkable in this film.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

552,substitutiary locomotion,What book were you reading again?,10,17 July 2000,"THIS CONTAINS A BUNCH OF POTENTIAL SPOILERS- INTENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE FILMI am flabberghasted by the reviews of this film I have read here today.  I'm beginning to wonder if I have a different version of the novel and saw a different version of Plein Soleil than everyone else.  Yes, the novel is good, but it could never be made into a film, as Ripley is far less intriguing because he's unscrupulous from the beginning. Plein Soleil is pure tripe, and not half the film that The Talented Mr. Ripley is.Tom's homosexuality is not veiled in the novel as has been suggested by several people;  rather, it is all but plainly stated right on the page, and Tom kills Dickie in the novel because Dickie realizes that Tom's gay and doesn't want anything to do with him anymore.  And he does it in cold blood- he thinks about it before he actually kills him.  The Tom of the film kills Dickie in a panic because Dickie wants to kill him for messing up his face.  And Tom only messes up Dickie's face in a fit of passion because Dickie is making fun of him and telling him that he's a loser and a bore.  And for those of you who didn't pick up on all of the blatant gay innuendo, Tom is in love with Dickie, not Marge.As for Plein Soleil, it is hardly subtle or nuanced, as has been suggested by some.  Rather, it is heavy-handed, totally unfaithful to the book in one of its most important themes (Tom must be gay), and totally mucks up the ending by having Tom get caught.  You may not have noticed, but there are four Ripley novels, so having him arrested at the end of the first would hardly work out for the other three.  And it certainly would be less torture for him, which is really the whole point, obviously.  There is a reason why American filmmakers made films noir, and the French only wrote about them.I think this film is brilliant.  Beautiful scenery and acting aside, the screenplay and direction are marvelous and convey a message seldom delivered so stealthily and expertly.  It's a shame that so few people actually get what Minghella was aiming at here.  Tom Ripley is the quintessential closeted gay young man.  He is not an evil homosexual homicidal psychopath, but a man who is unsure of himself and afraid to be his own person, to the extent that he has no personality.  The ""evil"" that overtakes him is the evil and decadence of his new friends- he is so weak that he allows their personalities to dominate his and he takes on a little of theirs.  He doesn't set out from the get-go to take over Dickie's life;  in fact, the thought doesn't even occur to him until the desk clerk at their San Remo hotel mistakes him for ""Signor Greenleaf.""Then he does what most young gay men do when they first realize who and what they are- he pretends to be somebody he's not.  This is all the more ironic and brilliant because he IS gay, and he's actually pretending to be a real-life other person.  But in order to be safe, he can't ever reveal his true self or allow it to be revealed.  He kills Freddie Miles to avoid being outed as Tom Ripley instead of Dickie Greenleaf, and he kills Peter Smith-Kingsley to avoid being outed as a homosexual.  He is a truly tragic character, because he is doomed to be alone, and doomed to never get caught- he is trapped in the basement with his demons, and even he doesn't have the key to let himself out.  The end of the film is far from disappointing, unless you're one of those people who expects everything to be wrapped up neatly in the end, for the murderer to be arrested and the truth known.  I submit that the end of Ripley is far more appropriate than having him caught- he is tortured by his own guilt and the knowledge that his life is a total fabrication built on death and lies.  He is destined to live the rest of his life in fear of being caught, and that is a far worse fate than spending life in prison or being hanged.
I thought Matt Damon was impeccably Tom.  Jude Law was fabulous as simultaneously charming and despicable. Gwyneth was Gwyneth (one point I seem to agree with a lot of folks on), and Cate was her usual wonderful self. Though I must say that Philip Seymour Hoffman stole the picture- I was rooting for another 7 minutes on screen Dame Judi Dench supporting Oscar win for him, because he was just that good.  This film deserves 11 out of 10, but I'll settle for 10.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

554,krist-7,Beautiful and Disturbing,9,14 March 2001,"""I heard that movie sucked!"" Yep, that's the standard reply I hear from people when I mention The Talented Mr. Ripley. While this movie isn't for everyone, it's tough to deny Director/Writer Anthony Minghella's incredible talent. By opting to ignore the typical devices used to create suspense, he crafted an intriguing psychological study. I've written 2 film papers on ""Ripley,"" and because of this I have needed to watch this movie hundreds of times, yet every time I watch it I notice something new. It possesses so many different dimensions, it's virtually impossible to absorb it all after only one viewing.Jude Law turns out a stunning performance as the charismatic Dickie Greenleaf. In this age when beauty is worth everything, it's nice to see an actor that not only has a pretty face, but the skills to back it up. If there ever is an up-and-coming actor that deserves Hollywood fame, Jude Law is the one.Playing the role of Tom Ripley, Matt Damon also turns out a quality performance. His portrayal of the title character is more reserved than Law's, but in my opinion, Tom's character warranted such a portrayal. The subtle changes in his face, his comparative softness to Dickie's bold character fits perfectly.If you want to see an action-packed flick, go rent something with Arnold Schwartzenegger. But if you're like me and prefer to be challenged by the films you see, maybe you will understand the underlying value one can gain from watching The Talented Mr. Ripley.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

I think the reason this film is so bothering, is that Ripley's problems concern each one of us. We want to be someone else. Life is always somewhere else. We try to reach this far place, but when we get there, it's not so charming as it was, and the long awaited treasure seems to move mysteriously to a new far place. And so, 'each man kills the thing he loves'. Perhaps the homosexual feels this problem - which concerns straight like me as well - more clearly, because his most elementary borders are fluid. He can be anything - but than he kills the thing he become, the thing he loved. (Forgive me my English and my being too philosophical, due to language problems).",The Talented Mr. Ripley

I love the book, it's a fascinating story and Ripley is such an interesting anti-hero, and the author (Patricia Highsmith) manages to maintain the moral ambiguity and never judges or encourages the reader to judge the actions of this monster-hero.But they took a great story, a cast A-listers with a lot of actual acting talent, set it in beautiful places with the most amazing, stylish costumes and sets. And created the most tedious movie I have ever seen. There should have been pace. There should have been a relationship with Ripley where the viewer cannot help hoping he will get away with his crimes even while hoping he will somehow be stopped. Highsmith did this in her novel. It wasn't achieved in the movie at all. The whole cinema sighed in relief when the credits finally rolled. Such a shame. A waste of good talent.Read the book!",The Talented Mr. Ripley

BTW, are we supposed to root for Mr. Ripley? cause honestly, I hated the character since the beginning. Throughout the movie, it seemed to me that the director had run out of ideas and didn't know exactly what to do with the characters, so the story kept being dragged and dragged and dragged to the point of being ridiculous, nothing made sense. Actually, if an alien spaceship with a little green man inside had appeared at the end to kidnap the main character, it would have been more interesting.

It probably wasn't the goal, but it can never achieve the status of original one. Matt is a fine fellow, he's done a good job, but non comparable to Alain. Gwyneth & Jude had a lower standing point and nobody (not really, but...) to compete to, somehow. And they also look too childish somehow. Probably just another Hollywood product when fresh ideas run slow, so they turn back to history.

559,jacqline8,The unlikeable Mr. Ripley,8,9 February 2009,"I just revisited The Talented Mr. Ripley last night after 10 years of not seeing it, and I probably enjoyed the film more than the first time I watched it. But I don't think I need to add any more to the praise that has already, and rightfully, been heaped on every single one of the actors. This was excellent casting and the leading man, Matt Damon, certainly delivered. I just wanted to say that I didn't have the same feelings of sympathy for Damon's Tom Ripley character that other viewers and reviewers here seem to have. I never ""rooted"" for him, like I usually do for the mischievous bad guy in a movie. I found Ripley almost entirely unlikeable, and I was looking forward to him getting caught and punished for his loathsome, leechiness as well as his crimes. Alas, it looks like he gets away with his misdeeds as far as the law is concerned. Fortunately, the author has indicated that Ripley DOES suffer a bit emotionally, even if it's only for selfish reasons. His sobbing while killing Peter was a great illustration of the pain that plagues him because he ""must"" do abhorrent things to continue living a false but better life than the one he was born to.I'm glad they never contrived a sequel. The film's ending was brilliant and disturbing, and that's just where the story should stop... without tying up this character's complex and wounded life in a neat and satisfying package.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
560,patorpey,A failed attempt...,4,20 May 2001,"I was under the impression that this was a clever and interesting film. However, I found this film to be a considerable disappointment. It seems as though this film is Anthony Minghella's failed attempt to assume the role of Alfred Hitchcock. The first evidence of this is the graphically stylized opening sequence and matching closing shot, not uncommon for a Hitchcock film. The subject matter is obviously reminiscent of a Hitchcock piece, such as Vertigo. Unfortunately, Minghella was unable to create a suspenseful and interesting film in the style of the ""Master."" While the acting was adequate, the development of characters was quite weak, with the exception of Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport), and Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn).

Jude Law also does an amazing job, as the supporting actor, and all in all, just great acting all around. The plot is also very good.

It really makes you feel Ripley's attraction to Greenleaf. Jude Law just oozes sexuality on screen while also showing you Greenleaf's heartless and vain side. We feel the rejection and pain when Greenleaf gets bored with Ripley. But we also feel Greenleaf's fear of how Ripley is getting out of control. I actually felt that the Marge character was boring, though. She seems too much like a pawn to me. She gets patted about by all the characters.I had one question about the final scene. When Ripley kills his lover the lover says, ""You are crushing me!"" I can't figure out how this was accomplished. There was no obvious weapon in the room. And I've never heard of someone being crushed to death in hand to hand combat--if he said, ""you're choking me!"" it would have made more sense.Or did he mean he was getting a kick to the groin?

566,htimseregor,One of the stupidest movies to star such a talented cast.,1,23 October 2009,"I was completely shocked to see all of the comments praising this movie.I rented this movie a few years back expecting to watch a fine psychological thriller. What I saw instead was an incredible waste of time. I kept watching, and it didn't get better. So where do I start? Let's start with Mr. Ripley himself (who is actually not Ripley but an impersonator). Matt Damon is a great actor and shouldn't be judged by this role. Actually his acting wasn't the problem. It was the character himself. Most villains are compelling (Hannibal Lecter, Buther Bill). They inspire a sense of dread, and are always interesting. Ripley was not! As noted by Jude Law's character he was boring! His character was terrible to watch. His ability to mimic other people was bizarre and not in a good way. I couldn't get into the character and actually cringed every time he was on the screen. And what about Jude Law's character? Man was he annoying! I spent most of the movie wishing I could slap his face. His death scene was actually my favorite part of the movie. It was extremely funny, and it was supposed to be serious. The only thing good about this movie was Gywneth Paltrow. She was the only one in the movie I even cared about. Take my advice. Skip this one.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
567,jla0890,A simple view,7,24 April 2011,"Tom Ripley who is played by Matt Damon is a man of many talents. The talent that Matt Damon plays very well is split personalities. Tom is wearing a Princeton jacket while he plays the piano at this garden party. A wealthy father walks up to Tom recognizing his jacket talks to him asking if he knows his son Dickie Greenleaf who is played by Jude Law. Once this relationship between Tom and Mr. Greenleaf (the father) was established, Mr. Greenleaf offered Tom a job to go to Italy to convince Dickie to come home. Once in Italy Tom attaches himself to Dickie and Marge this is when Tom's personality changes. Dickie begins to grow bored of Tom and is disgusted by him. Tom goes to great lengths to make Dickies privileges his own. After Tom assumes Greenleaf's identity it's a roller coaster ride to see how well he plays a split personality. Tom Ripley is callous, calculating and amoral. In the course of the film, he lies, cheats, deceives and kills any one who shows hesitation to the stories Tom tells them. Tom is cold, yet the viewers sense this closeness with Tom. We want him to succeed and we applaud him when he finally escapes justice, which isn't the typical outcome in a movie like this. We side with Tom, the audience sympathizes with Tom when Dickie is telling Tom is a leech and he bores him. The theme throughout the movie betrays that Tom does not have the ability to be him self. Tom is an isolated man who his only desire is to portray himself as others. The technique used in this film is very much appreciated by viewers that truly understand the art of filmmaking. One technique that was used in making the film was lighting. The lighting helps make sure the mood and tone of light assistance in telling the story while revealing the character. The lighting was used through out the film. The part in the film that I particular liked was when Tom first arrived in Italy and he was trying to get Dickies attention. Tom's body was so pale, which this contrast with the other tan bodies on the beach. This is to introduce an ""outsider"", which is Tom's attempt to twist his way into the new social network that Dickie has elaborately established. The second technique that was used in this film is angle, which makes the film have a unique style. The scene where Dickie and Tom take their last trip together on the train, it's important that they had a mirror image of Tom smelling and laying his head on Dickie. This part of the film is telling the viewers that Tom is trying to become more like Dickie to make sure when he impersonates Dickie he has every part down. The mirror image is showing the viewers Tom's full facial expression while he smelling and laying his head on Dickie. The angle of the camera allows the viewers to see what otherwise you wouldn't be able to see. The unique techniques that are used in this film are one that makes the theme of the film pop out. Every technique that was used in the film was used to make the film have this persona that allowed you to think until the very end. Making the viewers want the antagonist to win in the end this is because the theme makes the viewers feel for Tom.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

I believe that his screenplay was even better than the original novel (which is saying a lot). Mostly, however, I am impressed with the acting in this film.  Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gweneth Paltrow, and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann are the best ensemble cast (in this movie) perhaps that I have ever seen.  The subtle characterization that each actor put into these characters and the interaction between these characters are like nothing I have ever seen and they took my breath away.

570,madsmichelsen,A Greek Gay Tragedy,10,18 September 2003,"SPOILERS My understanding differs from that of most other commentators in three respects: First, this is not first and foremost a thriller or a suspense movie. Second, Tom does not fit the villain- or even the anti-hero-box. The movie plays like a Greek tragedy, and Greek tragedies rely heavily on the workings of fate. Oedipus was not crook - he was destined to do what he did and could not change that, no matter how hard he tried. Third, the fact that the main character is gay is not incidental, it is central. How can it be otherwise in a movie that is all about identity? Tom's identity is a vacuum. Being a gay man (and one that recognises himself as such, closeted or not) in the fifties from a working class background robs him of an identity, of a home, because there is no place for such a character in 50s American society. Tom's quest for identity, for safe ground under his feet, makes the film an Odyssey - Ulysses is history's first big con man, and the borrowing of the Princeton jacket is pure Trojan Horse. Tom wishes to enter that upper class world because of the prospect that it - in opposition to his current standing - might just have a place for a  sensitive and refined boy, such as Tom. ""I always thought it'd be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody."" Tom says. But Ulysses is nobody - away from home and lost at sea - not in the sense of a ""loser"" but as a man without a home, which is equal to being without an identity. ""We'll make a sailor of you, yet"", Dickie tells Tom. But as Tom penetrates the world he adores and covets, he learns that it does not hold a resting place for him either, and he must keep on moving, travelling, sailing for a safe haven, that does not exist.Tom settles in with Dickie and Marge and slowly assumes their lifestyle. And is happy. And falls in love. With the lifestyle but above all with Dickie. This is where the film's central question comes into play: Can love save Tom Ripley? We know of his sociopathic tendencies, his insecurities, his burning desire for recognition in a hostile world, yet we (I) desperately want him to be saved from all of that. The main reason it fails is because Dickie cannot-will not recognise his own bisexuality. Dickie, like Tom, will not accept whom 50s America tells him he is - the heir to a shipping business - and flees that. But Dickie is constantly on the run, never staying still, trying to forget his identity as ardently as Tom is trying to find one. In the end Tom kills Dickie as Dickie is tearing Tom's newly constructed world apart. He mocks Tom's insecurities and expresses disgust at his love and Tom must kill the one he loves. Tom takes on Dickie's identity - if he can't be with Dickie he can be Dickie - and maybe he even convinces himself that he can right Dickie's wrongs, make the story end the way it should have. But being somebody else is not a way of finding yourself and Tom inevitably makes ""a mess of being Dickie Greenleaf.""If this was not exactly that sort of Greek tragedy with more and more implausible twists and turns, the end would require something of a leap of faith. From one moment to the next everything is looking up for Tom Ripley. He is cleared of suspicion, he gets recognition and money from Dickie's father, Tom even - finally - ""got someone who loves him"". And that is good. But maybe it's too late? Maybe by now he has been so thoroughly corrupted by his actions and surroundings that he can no longer trust in anything, even Peter's love. It is certainly an Odyssey without and end, no Penelope, no Ithaca, and the end of the movie portrays one of the most pitiable creatures I've ever seen on screen. Killing off his one chance of redemption.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
571,jdustein,A movie must see,9,27 January 2014,"The Talented Mr. Ripley is ominous and foreboding, suspenseful and exciting, slow and emotional. The movie has as many facets as Mr. Ripley has talents, and it takes the viewer through an interesting and worthwhile experience. The movie is set in the late 1950s and begins just as Tom Ripley--if that is his real name--begins his grand act of deception. The movie is based on a series of novels written by Patricia Highsmith that are centered on Mr. Ripley. Tom Ripley, who is played by Matt Damon, deceives a man into believing that he knows his son well. That man decides to send Tom to Italy to retrieve his son, Dickie Greenleaf. Dickie, who is played by Jude Law, is privileged and arrogant, but he is also adored by those who know him. His father believes he has been sailing and schmoozing in Italy for far too long. Dickie's father promises to pay Tom's travel expenses and award him $1,000 to return with Dickie. Tom readily accepts the offer. The first scene that intrigued me was when Tom lands in Italy. He meets a pretty American girl named Meredith, played by Cate Blanchett, and he introduces himself as Dickie Greenleaf. I almost did not catch the lie at first, and I nearly forgot about it when Tom says goodbye to Meredith, returns to being Tom Ripley, and goes to meet up with Dickie. Tom pretends to meet Dickie by chance and tells him they knew each other in college. Dickie is with his girlfriend Marge, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, and, of course, he does not recognize Tom. Tom builds his talents for deception while making his way into Dickie's life, but he uses the truth of his mission to gain Dickie's trust. They quickly become friends. Everything seems to be going well for Tom, and it is at this point that I began to empathize with him because of his eagerness to participate socially and his obvious fear of loneliness.As he and Dickie become closer, Tom's attraction for Dickie becomes palpable. At the same time, Dickie takes note of Tom's infatuation and tries to brush him away by spending time with other friends. In a scene that left me shocked and confused, Tom's jealousy and passion overwhelm him while he and Dickie are sailing. They are arguing because Dickie tries to tell Tom he doesn't think that they should be friends anymore, and that Tom should return to America. Tom strikes Dickie with an oar and, after a scuffle, Tom beats Dickie to death. Tom cries as he hugs the bloodied corpse, once again leaving me unsure of Tom's plan--if he even has a plan. Tom's journey truly begins as he starts to cover his tracks and decides that his only option is to attempt to steal Dickie's life. Tom tells Marge that Dickie is just taking time away. He tells those who know him as Tom that Dickie is away, and he tells others that he is Dickie. He cashes Dickies checks and lives in his home. The other characters become pieces in Tom's game and he manipulates them to support his web of lies. Tom murders again when Dickie's friend, who has met Tom as Tom, is on the verge of discovering Tom's ruse. Once again, the murder does not seem predetermined, and Tom does it out of necessity because he cannot stand to lose his new lifestyle. Tom's lies and murders begin to spiral out of control as the police become involved. I found myself wondering if Tom would have to kill everyone in Italy that knew Dickie. I also began to empathize with Tom's delusional scheme because he seems to only want attention and affection from others. Dickie's friends become increasingly worried about his absence, and Dickie's father travels to Italy and hires a private investigator. Just as Tom's evil plan is about to break apart, Tom gets away clean. Tom forges a suicide letter from Dickie, and the police and private investigator come to conclusions that leave Tom innocent. Marge is the only person who suspects Tom, but she has become emotionally distressed and no one believes her. Dickie's father even leaves Tom some of Dickie's trust fund. Tom murders one last time as the movie ends. A man who had become his lover poses one last threat to his discovery because he still knows him as Tom, and others that know him as Dickie are aboard the same ship. Tom smothers him while crying to himself. I found this movie to be thrilling, and honestly, confusing. I could watch it again and again and probably absorb some new, interesting aspect each time. Matt Damon gives a great performance that shows range that I have not seen in his later performances. I wish that I had seen this fantastic work of art earlier, and I am eager to read the books it is based on.",The Talented Mr. Ripley

Jude Law is convincing as the charming Dickie Greenleaf, Gwyneth Paltrow (as Marge) and Cate Blanchett play their roles well but most credit can be given to Matt Damon, who is surprisingly believable as Tom Ripley, a nobody who turns out to be a clever liar and a great impersonator, which finally makes him become Dickie Greenleaf.I would recommend this movie to anybody and not only to Matt Damon fans, because it is really worth seeing.. multiple times.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
573,zanydr18,Suspense,8,18 October 2017,"This is a REMAKE of the 1960 movie, ""Purple Noon"", a foreign film. It starred Alain Delon. I do not know why this is not said anywhere at all! Having seen both, I believe this one was much better. The acting, the plot, the suspense timing and twists done, all coincided well with the 1960 film, but this version outdid the original by far. The only thing else I could say is the 1960s actors were prettier.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
574,rhysowen55,The Talented Mr.Everyone involved in this film,10,25 February 2014,"Just one of those films where every actor (with any dialogue) is given a three dimensional character and plenty of room to show off their acting chops. It's been described as 'a powerhouse of young talent' it certainly was that, with the opening credits listing what is soon to be the cream of Hollywood's talent. Although the film is moderately lauded by those who have seen it and perfect in nearly every aspect, it is not regarded as the classic it should be. Taking many successful risks, for example casting Matt Damon in the psychopathic role he plays is certainly over looked, even though he is regarded the 'nice guy' of Hollywood it is shocking how well he pulls it off. Still giving the role a lot of charisma and empathy. Watch it!",The Talented Mr. Ripley

576,karick,Talented Mr. Ripley,10,15 January 2005,"The best film I've ever seen. Super acting, Super story, Super music, super super super... CLASSIC!!! take your time to watch and join the ride to the early days of the 50th in Italy in this thriller of sex and lies... Some people never have seen this movie because it is not the most commercial movie of Matt Damon. If you can you will feel the sphere of this movie... this movie you can watch over and over again because so many thinks happens, the part before the killing, the days after and... You will think of this movie after you've seen it for some days. Does the father of Dicky knows he did it?... Why he did it again at the end of the movie...",The Talented Mr. Ripley
577,ovationlover,Il meglio?,6,11 May 2006,"A good solid film in its own right, however as an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel it is somewhat floored, and perhaps driven by recent biographical research that have revealed Highsmith's problematic sexual preference. The inclusion of Jack Davenport's character in comparison to the novel, where he does not exist, not only undermines the books paradoxically liberating finish, but is also somewhat hackneyed. As such he appears as an almost transient artificial device in the film, used only so that Minghella can fulfil his own agenda. The explicitly homo-erotic tension of the bath scene early is not only absurd, but badly scripted and comes off as being revealing of the directors trajectory of thought than as belonging in the actual narrative.The overall triumph of the film are some fantastic performances by Damon, Law and Paltrow and the locations fit the bill supremely. To compare films with their books, is a little like comparing apples and oranges. Platitudes aside, the book is one of the finest pieces of fiction I have read, and whilst the film is certainly extremely viewable, the novel left me feeling more fulfilled.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
578,AleckSandr,A truly talented movie,10,16 May 2005,"I have been fascinated by this truly talented movie since I first saw it some years ago. This is the only film which I saw at least 20 times. Every time I watch it I seem to myself simply to be dissolved in it. I feel as if I were an invisible film participant who constantly accompanies the characters......Tom Ripley, the main character of the movie, is an unwanted, poor lad who early understood that it was actually impossible to succeed in life without protection and support. I could sympathize with him. When Tom gets an opportunity to change his life and happens to know the happiness of that glorious world his bad instincts fail him.I don't identify myself with Tom. I could be Peter though. I think Jack Davenport played one of his best roles. The homosexual tendencies of the characters don't scare me and I don't focus on them.The characters of the movie are making their way in the world - that's what we all do - and how they do it attracts our attention.The cast is splendid. It's like a precious brooch - twinkling scattered diamonds and emeralds - every stone in itself is of some importance and is strongly attracted by others.It is a beautiful film. Elegant, dramatic, fascinating, mysterious, exciting...... I really enjoyed every scene. I also liked the fine music so tastefully arranged by the authors of the movie - it fascinated me from the very beginning.In my eyes this film is perfect.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
579,ericka-38681,"Compelling, well-acted thriller with elements of Hitchcock",8,27 March 2015,"Based on the pulp novel by Patricia Highsmith, this psychological thriller combines elements of classic Hitchcock with some of the best actors of the time. Ordinary Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a sociopath who befriends Dickey Greenleaf (Jude Law), a jazz-loving, womanizing golden-boy from a wealthy family. The two cross paths while vacationing on the Italian Riviera. Tom is sent by Dickey's disapproving father to bring him back to the U.S. The two have nothing in common, yet, Tom manages to manipulate his way into Dickey's life and soon Dickey is unable to get rid of him. Like a Hitchcock thriller, this film is filled with plot twists, interesting characters and dynamic scenery that keeps the story rolling until the surprise ending. Also, not to be missed: ""Purple Noon."" Filmed in 1960, this is the French version of The Talented Mr. Ripley and stars a very sexy Alain Delon.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
580,laixiwen,Why do you blame MrRipley,10,14 July 2015,"So many people who have watched this movie think it is Ripley who to blame.BUT I don't think so.As far as I'm concerned ,Dickie is the real murderer.He once gave Ripley hope to climb higher,but before long he abandoned Ripley,leaving him in loss and desperation.It must hurt Ripley deeply.Although Ripley shows a dark side of human nature,what about Dikie?The poor play boy,he never thought about others' feelings.It's his selfish that lead to Ripley's being hurt(mentally),thus lead to other people's death. Don't always blame Ripley,just think what made him that cruel.It's not just simple write or wrong,it's why and how.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
581,mydelsol7,Good and bad,6,8 December 2005,"This movie had great cinematography, superb acting and interesting ideas, but the pacing seemed off and it dragged quit a lot in places. I loved certain parts, but the over all structure of the movie felt weak. I know this is more of a character movie but the plot had almost no momentum at all which lead to a friend I was seeing the movie with to ask me ""If I go to the bathroom do you think anything might actually happen...?"" While every actor did fine job, Matt Damon was particular good, I had not thought him a very good actor before this picture and he rarely lives up to his talent afterwards. I think I may watch it again and would recommend someone else watching it as it is a challenging picture.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
582,sallyp0771,Boring and TOO LONG,1,3 January 2006,"I went to this movie with 5 other people. About half way through the movie we started looking at each other like.... ""Is this as bad as I think it is?"" We MADE ourselves finish the movie. It never got better. We kept thinking.... OK it's going to end soon....But NO SUCH LUCK! about half of the people in the theater left before the movie was over.Watching this movie was pure torture. Plus a total waste of money. It is one of the (if not THE) worst movies I have ever seen.It's too bad really because there were some really good actors in the movie. The story line and script were just horrible. HORRIBLE!It just goes to show you that no matter how many excellent actors you have in a movie... if the plot stinks nothing can save it.",The Talented Mr. Ripley
