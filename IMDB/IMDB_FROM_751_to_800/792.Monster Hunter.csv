0,SnoopyStyle,lower expectations,6,7 March 2021,"Ranger Artemis (Milla Jovovich) leads her soldiers on a mission to find a missing squad. They are hit by a mysterious lightning sandstorm and get transported to another world. It's a world of monsters and monster hunters like a nameless local hunter (Tony Jaa).Apparently, this is based on a video game. I'm not familiar with it. Quite frankly, I'm not familiar with most newer video games but I am familiar with filmmaker Paul W.S. Anderson and his wife Milla Jovovich. Expectations are low and this movie barely clears them. Jovovich is fine. She's familiar with this type of action fantasy but I really wish they didn't have a sing along. Compared with other video game inspired movies, this is fine but that's not saying much. I would like for Artemis to start with better chemistry with Tony Jaa's character. It may be better to keep T.I. for a little longer. I don't know if The Admiral is a character from the game but he really shouldn't speak English. At first, I thought that he came from our world. That would have been better or else, he should just not speak English. All in all, I have no need to watch this again. Once is more than enough.",Monster Hunter
1,nogodnomasters,It is weakest right before it is going to breathe fire,7,28 February 2021,"Army Ranger Captain Artemis (Milla Jovovich) and company are transported to another world filled with monsters. She eventually teams up with Tony Jaa to fight monsters on various boss levels. This is a high octane action film based on a video game. Plot is secondary to effects and fighting. It is a combination of ""Star Gate"", ""LOTR"" ""Rodan"" and ""Fritz the Cat.""Good action film. Nothing more or less.",Monster Hunter
2,paul_haakonsen,Not bad for a movie adaptation of a computer game...,6,16 February 2021,"When they announced this movie, I must admit that I was looking forward to getting to watch it. Granted, I hadn't tried the game, but I was familiar with the game concept.But at the same time, that voice at the back of my head went 'it's based on a computer game', and I must admit that fears of it turning into something dreadful like ""Mortal Kombat"", ""Super Mario Bros"", ""Street Fighter"", ""Tekken"", or such, then I was a bit worried that it would suffer terribly.Let me be the first to say that the movie wasn't as bad as it could have been. Sure, with it being based on a computer game, then the story wasn't really multi-layered deep or particularly complex. In fact, the storyline is so simplistic that you just switch off your brain, lean back and enjoy the special effects.So director Paul W.S. Anderson does manage well enough to turn another computer game into a movie. Thumbs up on that accomplishment. Just hoping he is not going to overkill it and sink it well beyond 6 feet into the ground, as he did with the ""Resident Evil"" franchise.Yeah, this was a special effects movie, first and foremost. And they managed to produce some really amazing CGI in the movie, believe you me. And whatever little was there in terms of storyline, plot and script came in second.""Monster Hunter"" was a movie that had my interest also because of Thai martial artist Tony Jaa being on the cast list. And I will say that he was well-casted for the movie, as he added a very exotic element to the movie with his character and portrayal of the character. Now, with Milla Jovovich you pretty much know what you are in for, and she does deliver what you'd expect from her. The movie also have Ron Perlman on the cast list, though he is not one I am particularly much a fan of.If you enjoy visually astounding action movies where you don't need your brain to be up and running, then ""Monster Hunter"" is the movie for you. While it was watchable and entertaining, this was hardly a cinematic masterpiece, nor a movie that I believe is something I will return to watch a second time.My rating of the 2020 movie ""Monster Hunter"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Monster Hunter
3,zardoz-13,Monsters Galore,5,11 January 2021,"After parlaying Capcom's ""Resident Evil"" into the most successful videogame film franchise in history, coining slightly more than $1.2 billion at the box office, writer & director Paul W.S. Anderson, who penned six of the ""Resident Evil"" epics but helmed only four, has returned to adapt yet another Capcom videogame for the big screen. Anderson has appropriated the fantasy-themed, escapade-oriented, role-playing videogame ""Monster Hunter,"" featuring dinosaur-sized carnivores of every outlandish description on a heretofore unknown, hostile rock of a planet, for his third videogame adaptation. Least we may have forgotten, Anderson adapted the ""Mortal Combat"" videogame as his first big screen actioneer. Anderson's ""Mortal Combat"" (1995) raked in enough receipts to inspire the 1997 sequel ""Mortal Combat: Annihilation."" Since I've never played the ""Monster Hunter"" videogame, I cannot verify the film's fidelity to its source material, but I've heard from those who've played it that Anderson's adaptation is faithful enough. Anybody who has been watching sci-fi/horror movies since ""Alien"" (1979) will recognize the films which Anderson has plundered for this larger-than-life spectacle that is just as silly as it is shallow. No, Anderson veered clear of any ""Sharknado"" homages, but he has preyed on virtually every other popular sci-fi saga.
Just as she fronted for Anderson in the ""Resident Evil"" outings, Milla Jovovich stars here as indestructible U.S. Army Ranger Captain Natalie Artemis. She supervises a UN Joint Security Operation rescue mission when everything goes haywire. Not surprisingly the Ukrainian-born actress is every bit as resilient as she was playing Alice in the ""Resident Evil"" epics. At age 45, Jovovich still looks pretty formidable, even when she is slaying mythical monsters. Anybody who has followed her career knows Jovovich doesn't play weak-kneed women. She'll probably ride ""Monster Hunter"" into her early sixties if it can recoup its $60-million budget. Remember, 64-year-old Linda Hamilton defied infirmity to reprise her iconic role in ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" (2019), so why shouldn't Jovovich? ""Monster Hunter"" will do more for Jovovich's career than for her acrobatic co-star Tony Jaa. Anderson doesn't exploit the Thai martial arts sensation for everything he's worth. Instead, he casts Jaa as an otherworldly alien hunter, christened 'Hunter' by our heroine. Rather than performing his gravity defying Muay Thai stunts from his ""Ong-Bak"" (2003) trilogy, Jaa wields a huge bow and sports a sword the size of a dinosaur's jawbone. Unlike Jovovich's English speaking Artemis, Jaa's character delivers all his lines in an extraterrestrial, gobbledygook dialect without subtitles, so heroine and hero contend with a daunting language barrier. Mind you, they do communicate, but their conversations remain largely monosyllabic. Almost as an afterthought, Anderson throws in a third hero, the Admiral (Ron Pearlman of ""Hellboy"") who looks years younger than he should thanks to a fright wig. Unfortunately, Pearlman joins them belatedly near the end of the film.Since it boasts a PG-13 rating for ""for sequences of creature action and violence throughout,"" this Screen Gems release targets teens and twentysomethings more than mature adults. Of course, some mature adults may still yearn for the movies they enjoyed as teens. Meantime, as incoherent as Anderson's screenplay is, ""Monster Hunter"" amounts to a visual buffet for the eyes with its spectacular CGI laden combat. The variety of monsters is particularly impressive. One critter resembles an enormous earwig with water buffalo horns. This abomination cruises beneath the desert sands of the inhospitable ""New World"" where a Bravo Team of U.S. Rangers vanished during an ominous storm without leaving a trace of their departure behind on Earth after having been mysteriously transported to another planet. Indeed, the gateways between the Old World-obviously, Planet Earth-and the New World-wherever it is--resembles those in both ""Stargate"" (1996) with Kurt Russell and ""Doom"" (2005) with Dwayne Johnson. Captain Artemis' Alpha unit gets zapped by similar lightning and pursues the Bravo team to the other side. No sooner have they landed in the barren, rocky New World than our heroes and heroines know they're living on borrowed time as they tangle with titanic monsters. A gargantuan dragon emerges near the end as their worst nightmare. Initially, a fully rigged, 18th century galleon ship is shown plying a turbulent desert of sand in ""Monster Hunter"" as if they were sailing the briny blue, with their destination a dark, mysterious tower shrouded in clouds but illuminated by lightning that has created an Armageddon. Although Artemis, Hunter, and the Admiral make an invincible threesome, our heroine watches in disbelief as this ferocious dragon racks up a double-digit body count and destroys million-dollar Pentagon hardware as if it were dime store toys.Clearly, Anderson has recycled the monsters from ""Dune"" (1984) that lurked beneath the sun scorched sands. Artemis also tangles with some rapacious arachnids that rival the spiders in ""Starship Troopers"" (1997), and at one point she winds up in a digestive tract sac awaiting death, as victims in Anderson's own earlier ""Alien vs. Predator"" (2004) where similar characters were incubated for dinner. Mind you, none of this supernatural saga makes a lick of sense. Meantime, Anderson orchestrates several colossal battles between our protagonists and their reptilian adversaries with enough gusto to keep us sufficiently diverted for the film's 99-minute length. The casualties are not only suitably violent, but also effusively gory. Despite the sensational CGI wizardry, we know neither humans nor monsters were harmed in the production of this movie. Basically, our protagonists fight the sand monster first, a legion of scorpions second, and ultimately a winged dragon reminiscent of HBO's ""Game of Thrones."" The dragon constitutes the apex predator. Intimidating as these monstrosities are, ""Monster Hunter"" drums up little more than formulaic fodder. Anderson doesn't provide adequate closure since the plot lacks a finale. Indeed, our heroes will have to polish off the dragon in a prospective sequel. Anderson pares the dialogue down to exposition and shuns characterization in favor of brute spectacle. Altogether, ""Monster Hunter"" qualifies as a far-fetched but fair caprice displaying a robust cast and some sterling computer-generated-imagery.",Monster Hunter
4,Calicodreamin,Visually immersive,6,19 December 2020,"The visuals of monster hunter were amazing, great monsters and vivid cinematography. There were quite a few jarring action scenes, but it worked well. The storyline itself left something to be desired, but the acting was decent and good fight choreography. If they made a sequel... I'd probably go see it.",Monster Hunter
5,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Does what it says on the tin, anticipate some negative side effects",6,13 November 2021,"When a small group of Rangers are suddenly teleported to an unknown land, and are attacked by beings not of this world, Captain Artemis(Milla Jovovich, bland but capable, like every other time she appears in one of her husband's movies. Seriously, is she not fed up with that by now? We know she can deliver incredible performances) and Tony Jaa's unnamed role, both having been separated from their group, have to work together to survive.Given the title, it is completely understandable to anticipate the following: Monsters, Hunters of such, and a deadly conflict between the two. And honestly, if that is the only thing that you want out of this, you might just leave satisfied. However, given the writer-director, It is necessary to adjust expectations. I don't know who is keeping Paul W. S. Anderson's career going. Is every viewer of his like me(baffled at how he keeps getting away with this, wondering when he's going to pick up a new bad habit, figuring that he'll probably never make a movie that's actually good, whilst also knowing that each of them will be enjoyable to watch)?Some of his worst traits are in this, and they are more aggressive than even the biggest, meanest creature featured. Probably the worst are the handheld shaky cam, and ""nowhere in the rulebook does it say that a cut has to last more than a fraction of a second"" editing(especially seen in the action scenes). You *will* leave with a headache. Honestly, I have to wonder how many people managed to sit through the entire thing in theatres, let alone 3D showings. Although this might not be the best movie that I've ever seen, I do think it has potential as a feature length disorientation device. Like if a flashbang exploded in extreme slow motion.This has a bit of effective gore(implied for the human characters, detailed for the rest) and a little strong language. I recommend this film only to the biggest fans of the property, and/or the man who deserves most of the credit (and, more to the point, the blame) for adapting it into this. 6/10.",Monster Hunter
6,deloudelouvain,"If you don't like Fantasy don't watch it, if you are watch it, it's as simple as that.",7,19 February 2021,"The ratings for Monster Hunter are too low. Those negative reviews come from people that don't really like the Fantasy genre so you shouldn't pay too much attention to those reviews. I wonder why people watch these kind of movies if they're not into the Fantasy genre? But if you are you certainly will appreciate Monster Hunter. The CGI's are of good quality, with impressive monsters as a result. There's constant action so getting bored is almost impossible. As for the acting it was what to expect from those names in the cast, professional and enjoyable to watch. It looks like there's going to be a sequel and I'm up for it, bring it on!",Monster Hunter
7,siderite,"It started really well, it fizzled in the middle and ended stupidly, but it was still very entertaining",6,17 February 2021,"At first I thought that this is an adaptation of The Doomfarers of Coramonde, which was a pretty formulaic and overly pompous book, but had the same premise: modern soldiers brought to another world and facing magical forces. But no, it is an adaptation from a video game. Still, I didn't know that when I watched the film, so I was pleasantly impressed when it started. Too many characters died at the same time for no good reason, people didn't really act like soldiers, but hell, it's Milla being tough and beautiful in a fantasy world, why complain?And indeed the beginning was great: special effects were good, even if they felt taken from other franchises and pasted here, the fight scenes were good, the horror scenes were good. I really expected something wonderful and was already looking forward to writing this review. However, after that came a section of the film that seemed to be unrelated: characters change location, monsters are different, new characters appear with one that speaks English so a complete change of tone. And then there is a really stupid fighting part at the end, I mean dumb as nails, and the film ends.How can you mess this up so much? Who writes a story about 8 characters and kills 7 off the bat? Who brings other 7 characters into the story and then have them do nothing at all? Who fights with swords and arrows against a creature that can open a tank like a can of tuna? So if I had to rate this film by parts it would be 8 stars, 6 stars, 2 stars. That ending, man... it sucked balls! It felt like someone told Anderson ""Hey! Remember this is a video game adaptation and so it HAS to be bad"". But it could have been so good!I haven't played the game and so I suppose some of the story wa locked in place, but really, how bad can this game be?",Monster Hunter
8,FeastMode,give me more!!!,6,2 June 2021,"This is exactly my kind of movie. I can't boast about how good of a movie it is. But it was fun as hell. If you give me incredible music with awesome monster fight scenes, i will be smiling and i will leave happy.There isn't much in the way of characters, dialogue or story. And the few hand-to-hand fight scenes were poorly done. But it was fast paced with some beastly scenes and beautiful shots. Oh and did i mention all of this was covered with amazing music? I strongly considered giving this a 7 and may on second viewing. I would ABSOLUTELY watch any sequelsnot sure how i feel about the cat tho lol (1 viewing, 6/1/2021)",Monster Hunter
9,westsideschl,Incredible CGI,10,7 April 2021,"One of the best CGI fantasy environments I've seen. The detail; color saturation; 3-D naturalistic movement of the nasty critters, and just a whole lot of them to keep you on your toes. They borrowed scenes from many past sy-fy movies, but did so in quality creative ways. We are given Dune sand monster w/footsteps on sand; above & below ground spider & web chase & entrapment; sand storm w/electrical discharge; dinosaurs (especially the rib cage scene reminds me of ""Pitch Black"") & fire breathing dragons; flaming swords; 3 masted sand schooner; monolithic mysterious structure; ""Guardians"" raccoon equivalent cat; parallel world. Just a very complete mixed bag even the dirt on the characters was real. Except, Milla still has lipstick - not uncommon w/female action characters. Nice adaption from the game.",Monster Hunter
10,The-Sarkologist,A Fun Waste of Time,5,9 January 2021,"A part of me really wasn't all that keen on seeing this, with Milla Jovovich running around killing a bunch of Kaiju, but I was down at the shopping centre to do other things, and since I had some time to kill I thought that it might be a good waste of time. It turned out that it was.Okay, I wouldn't really consider this film to be all that deep and meaningful, and honestly, films like this are never meant to be. However, it is sort of one of those films that you watch if you basically want to watch people, particularly Milla Jovovich, go around killing really big things in really imaginative ways.Actually, it turned out to be based on a video game, and it really shows how much I have lost touch with playing video games because I had never heard of it before watching this film, and doing a little bit of research on it afterwards. Mind you, I get the impression that some Youtube channels will have a field day poking fun at this film, particularly since Jovovich manages to survive a plane crash (in which nobody else managed to, but hey, it's a film).Look, it certainly isn't something that I would encourage people to go out to watch, unless they like the genre, but honestly, there are much better Kaiju films out there, even in the modern era (Pacific Rim is one of them). Yeah, it's fun, it's time wasting, but beyond that it really isn't all that special.",Monster Hunter
11,ops-52535,the nightmare aint over till its over,8,17 February 2021,"An average acted, no more than anticipated story, but with extremely lively and brilliant special visuals and audiographic effets, a score that hums you through the absolute worst jetload noisy parts,and an amazing job done scouting for actual locations.its a film that you should see whatever stars given, my eight is basicly there due to extremely well made audiovisual product, that gives a new dimension to the word superheroism. its short on smalltalk and caracterbuilding, its action en masse, and a sequel has to come, ill look forward to that hope it comes before the grumpy old man fades away.a recommend",Monster Hunter
12,UniqueParticle,Should've been R would've been better,8,28 June 2021,This movie is wildly entertaining despite any flaws. I think the director has done better at the the same time Monster Hunter is great action extravaganza; I think Tony Ja's character was a little over the top and shouldn't fight so much. I've never played any of the games but I should since I'm a huge gamer. Some of the reviews are hilarious I respect so many of them. I really like the creatures and scenes with characters singing. Pretty enjoyable for what it is.,Monster Hunter
13,paulclaassen,"Mindless fun? Nope, just MINDLESS!",2,31 May 2021,"Going into this movie, I expected mindless fun. Only, it was just mindless...Milla Jovovich is back kicking ass fighting creatures - or monsters if you will. From the script to the execution thereof, this was incomprehensible. The fight scenes between Jovovich and Tony Jaa were oh-so-childish, annoying, and painfully American. So Hollywood...ugh! The silly attempts at humor further ruined the movie. So much so, in fact, that I often found it almost unwatchable. There were so many scenes just making up time, that could easily have been cut.The editing is incredibly bad. The visual effects will have you raising an eyebrow. There was so little going on in this movie apart for people running away, monsters appearing, more running, more monsters... I was so bored. I mean, I literally hit the forward button at times!This film is a complete jumbled mess, using bits and pieces of so many other movies. How many movie references did you spot? Transformers. Clash of the Titans. Chronicles of Riddick. Pirates of the Caribbean. Tremors. Love and Monsters. Jurassic World. Godzilla.... wow, doesn't say much for originality, does it? I mean, there literally is no plot whatsoever. It was just a bunch of ideas thrown together. Seriously...?!The ending screams for a sequel. Please not!! Oh, this was atrocious!!!Would I watch it again? No, please no more!!!!",Monster Hunter
14,cruise01,"Big, loud, and a monster fun time that deserves to be seen on the big screen.",10,18 December 2020,"5 out of 5 stars.Monster Hunter is an awesome action monster film and a video game adaptation brought to the big screen. I barely played the game series. But know a little about it. Sure, the game to movie adaptation may have some differences and similarities. Like a character named Artemis (Milla Jovovich) who tries to build her weaponry and armory to fight back against the monsters in that world. Also there are some pretty awesome monsters brought from the games. And a few characters like another group of hunters travelling on a ship. And a fun one thats cat like thats in it for a brief moment.The plot is simple and great for an adaptation. Artemis and her military team mysteriously disappear when they run into a storm that set nearby rune markers. That tranported them to a monstrous world. Where they get hunted. Artemis comes across another hunter (Tony Jaa). Which they bond and become a fighting duo. Trying to cross a desert landscape. Trying to reach a tower which may be a portal back to Artemis world. While she comes across new characters and a couple of deadly monsters.The cast ensemble did great. Milla Jovovich is an awesome actress. And action star. Tony Jaa did a great job as well. Ron Perlman did a good job as another character on that planet.It is an awesome action film. Don't expect a development. Just sit back and enjoy the non stop loud and big action sequences. Director/writer Paul W. S. Anderson did a great job in delivering another video game franchise into a movie. He sure can set up an intense action sequences and never stop. The visual effects and creature design is awesome. The music score by Paul Haslinger did a great job. Making it a fun adventure. I loved Paul Andersons films and his Resident Evil films. He can create an exciting action packed film. Monster Hunter is another step up. It is big, action packed throughout, and does have a cliffhanger ending for a sequel while opening up the doors with the story to where it can go. There is a brief mid credit scene that hints on what is to come.",Monster Hunter
15,eddie_baggins,The exact type of movie promised,5,11 January 2021,"Surprisingly not likely to win any Oscars (unless the visual effects field finds itself in dire need of category fillers), Paul W.S Anderson's big screen adaptation of beloved video game property Monster Hunter provides the exact type of experience you would expect from the man that made his name with the Resident Evil franchise and while its choppy editing, small roster of monsters and weak script leaves much to be desired, there's enough going on here spectacle and adventure wise to make sure the experience here is enjoyable enough to make you not regret a use of your 90 minutes of time.Relentlessly paced for the most part (bar an odd mismatched duo segment that goes for far too long) to maximise the fact we are never allowed to ponder what exactly is happening or who it is happening to, Anderson and his on screen and off screen partner in crime Milla Jovovich push Monster Hunter forward at every moment and from the very first minute of screen-time where we witness a wig-wearing mutton chop sporting Ron Perlman piloting a pirate ship across a desert landscape you should know as a viewer that you will need to turn your brain off should you want to enjoy anything that is likely to come in the aftermath of this initiation into Anderson's event.What follows is bare-bones character exploration, a willingness to dispose of anyone that is standing on two legs and a story that is not even worth thinking about for more than a few seconds (much like the film does) as Anderson and Jovovich throw in some lovingly crafted throwbacks to the video games series and a visual representation of the world that will have fans giddy with glee, even if someone really needed to take those drones away from Anderson who seems to be like a kid in a candy store when it comes to sweeping his camera around without a second thought.In many instances Monster Hunter is one of the most faithful and fun big screen video game incarnations we've yet seen, the films battles with sand monsters the Diablo's and some other various beasts that make themselves apparent as Jovovich's lost in another world ranger Artemis and Tony Jaa's local hunter find themselves teaming up should they wish to survive the unforgiving surrounds of this alternate world are all creatively bought to life and make for some thrilling big screen moments of action.For all its popcorn munching goodness it's a shame that Anderson failed so miserably in the scripting stakes. No one was expecting Pulitzer Prize winning material from the writer/director but there's a lot of suspect scripting going on here and its treatment of some of its characters is quite poor with its odd couple racial differences wearing thin fairly early on with this problem joined by editor Doobie White, who seems to be channelling Michael Bay at his most ADHD in some of the films key battle moments, taking away enjoyment when we can't even tell who is doing what or what is happening to them.At days end despite all its failings and misguided aspects Monster Hunter does enough to make you not particularly anticipate but not hate the prospect of further adventures in the Monster Hunter universe with ample creatures and locales to explore with what one would hope to be more interesting characters and a more polished script.Final Say -If you've seen the trailers, played the games or watched any Paul W.S Anderson films in the past, Monster Hunter provides the exact type of experience you should be expecting and while there's some fairly dire elements to this film, its willingness to embrace its origins and stick tight to being the film it should be makes this a watchable exercise in escapist entertainment.2 1/2 Hershey's bars out of 5",Monster Hunter

Anderson and Milla Jovovich made/produced together. Everybody who watched some of their work (Resident Evil franchise) knows what to expect - a pop-corn action explosion without too much care for story or plot or what people call character development. What you get are what you ordered: fine visuals, lots of action, fighting and stunts, and with Milla Jovovich one of the few actresses that really can do action. What else: Monster Hunter mixes many elements/ideas of well known movies and books. To mind come names like The Final Countdown, Dune, Carter, Starship Troopers, Stargate and a few others. If you like that kind of movies and that mix sounds interesting to you, than Monster Hunter will deliver, if not, just don't bother.",Monster Hunter

That may seem weird to stay but the movie does star Milla Jovovich who stars in the Resident Evil franchise and was directed by her husband Paul W.S Anderson who directed the original Resident Evil and started the franchise. Like Resident Evil this movie is based on a Capcom game. All it needs is a metal sound track.Both Resident Evil and Monster Hunter have this similar set up and delivery that ideally makes it the same plot, but Monster Hunter does have something that Resident Evil does not have, The legendary Tony Jaa. He's not doing his Muay Thai Fury (and I did bat an eyelash when Jovovich and Jaa were deemed equals in a fight), but he got to show us her has personality. An impressive feat if you consider he spoke no English in this movie (Well like in most of his movies but in other movies we are paying to see him kick butt).This flick is pretty action orientated even the slow human moments were fast pace.

The effects are pretty enjoyable, like almost similar to Jurassic Park. Mila Jovovich and Tony Jaa do play off each other quite well, and both are really at action. Ron Perlman is also good in his supporting role. I never played the game in which this is based, but i'm sure it's every bit has entertaining.",Monster Hunter
22,kevin_robbins,This is one of those movies you may be surprised is a guilty pleasure,8,24 May 2021,"Monster Hunter (2020) is a movie the Mrs. And I caught in the movie theatres last week. The storyline focuses on a military unit that while on a mission in the Middle East find some ancient relics that sends the entire unit to another planet and dimension filled with humans trying to scavenge to survive and monsters of all types trying to eat them. The scavengers and military unit will have to work together to make the new planet better and get the military unit back home. This movie is directed by Paul W. S.

The storyline for this was so fun and reminded me of Hellboy, Pitch Black and Resident Evil. Yes, those movies aren't ""good,"" per se, but they're a lot of fun. So was this. The special effects on the monsters were awesome. The fight scenes between Milla and Jaa were amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie for what it was. The kill scenes and infection sequences were brilliant and the movie was way more intense than I anticipated. This is one of those movies you may be surprised is a guilty pleasure.

23,stevendbeard,Good & Entertaining Formula,7,19 December 2020,"I saw ""Monster Hunter"", starring Milla Jovovich-the Resident Evil movies, Dazed and Confused; Tony Jaa-Furious 7, the Ong Bak movies; Meagan Good-Prodigal Son_tv, Saw v and Ron Perlman-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the Hellboy movies.
This movie is based on the Capcom video game and is written & directed by Paul W.S. Anderson-he is known for doing the Resident Evil movies and Mortal Kombat, among a few others. He didn't stray far from the plot formula of the Resident Evil movies, using Milla Jovovich fighting monsters-instead of zombies-in a movie that is based on a video game. Having said that, it is still a good and entertaining formula. Milla is the leader of a group of soldiers-Alpha team-that is looking for her missing Bravo teammates. It seems that Bravo just disappeared and Milla soon learns where they went, after Alpha travels through a wormhole that leads to another planet inhabited by giant monsters. Meagan is a fellow soldier in Alpha team. Tony is one of the first humans Milla runs into on the new planet and Ron shows up later. The CGI looks pretty good and the ending is a set up for at least one sequel-depending on how well this one does-so if you enjoyed the Resident Evil movies, you should like this one, too. After the end credits start, there is a scene involving a hooded figure and a cat.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for creature action and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.
I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",Monster Hunter
24,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Monster Hunter,2,4 April 2021,"2/10 - the only thing that this kind of movie has going for it are impressive visual effects and these looked like they were cheap, 80s style effects done entirely on a green screened sound stage.",Monster Hunter
25,alindsay-al,An Average Big Screen Experience,5,22 June 2021,"There are plenty of films out at the moment and today I managed to find the time to go and see Monster Hunter and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of soldiers transported to a new world where monsters have taken over.Main Character
Mila Jovovich plays the lead character and she is fine. Once she starts to get into the role she shows a bit of personality and has a fun dynamic with one of the other characters. She sells the action scenes well and comes across as a legit action star for sure. But the issue is that her character is so boring and dull, the first act in particular she is unlikeable and it is difficult to turn that around for sure and the film can't do that enough to make this a really good character.Supporting Characters
Tony Jaa plays the main supporting character and he does a good job despite the fact that he barely speaks any English at all. He gives a very physical performance and does a really good job of being our introduction to this world and it is fun watching him on display and the dynamic between him and Jovovich is one of the more entertaining parts of the film. Ron Perlman plays a role here and he just doesn't get much to do apart from being the exposition dump and that is disappointing as he is pretty fun in his role. There are some other decent actors like TI and Meagan Goode and they are completely wasted and are actually annoying characters.Story
The story is easily the weakest element of the film with very little placed on it. The characters aren't really given the time to make the audience care and there isn't much given to what is exactly going on and the depth that is needed. The ending is also really infuriating, it sequel baits so hard and it doesn't have the right to do that and it comes across as more annoying then exciting for future films in this world.Script
The script started off poor, but actually some humour came into it and I did chuckle quite a bit and it helped build the relationship between Jovovich and Jaa which was one of the highlights of the film. But the drama is poor and the film doesn't make the plot interesting enough, it just felt like the actual script wasn't a priority here.Style
This is easily the best part of the film, it looks gorgeous with the backdrops being jaw dropping. The creature design is great with all the CGI holding up really nicely. If you are looking for a film that sees people fighting huge monsters then this film achieves that very well. I love how the weapon and costume design is so over the top and absurd which more films should copy and embrace. The film also has a really intense pacing to it and with the other weaknesses at least it is entertaining to watch.Overall
Overall, Monster Hunter is a very average film. It does monster fight scenes really well and if the amount of care that was put into the style was put into everything else then this could have been something special but it is only worth a watch for people who like large scale fight scenes.",Monster Hunter
26,kirbylee70-599-526179,MORE GAMES ON SCREEN,8,19 April 2021,"To say that MONSTER HUNTER is simply a game turned into more of a science fiction/fantasy film is not enough. First and foremost this movie is an action film. So much so that the first 25 minutes are nothing but non-stop action. Action on two different worlds even! But I'm getting ahead of myself.The movie opens in the New World, a land covered in sand with rock formations throughout. A ship is sailing across the sand when it is attacked by a Diablos, a gigantic scale covered creature that seems part lizard part insect. Tossed about during the attack the Hunter (Tony Jaa) is tossed overboard and separated from his ship.The real world present. A UN military team led by Army Captain Natalie Artemis (Mila Jovovich) is looking for a missing team that went to a dessert area ahead of them. Along the road they see stone markers with runes on them. With nothing but a recording of what took place, they see a mysterious dark storm filled with lightening heading their way, the same storm the recording mentions. As they try and escape the storm they see the stone markers light up and suddenly both vehicles are lifted in the air.The storm has taken this group to the New World but they aren't aware of that. Regrouping and righting their vehicles they head out only to be attacked by the Diablo. Impervious to their bullets they try to get away but not everyone will make it. Seeking cover they duck into a cave for safety only to find themselves surrounded by more creatures, this time a combination of lizard and giant spider. Artemis is left for dead and the others try to escape. When she wakes, she finds most of her team killed.Artemis escapes the Nerscyllas (the name of the lizard/spider combo) and runs into the Hunter who helped them earlier. Neither trusting the other they face off and fight for a while before finally coming to terms. They determine they have a common enemy and their only chance for survival is to unite to take out the creatures of this world. Learning that there is a tower from which the lightning emanates, Artemis determines her only chance for survival, and to return home, is to head that direction and find out what is behind it all.Based on the Capcom game of the same name the movie provides gamers and movie fans of the genre exactly what they're looking for. Tons of action, giant creatures and a puzzle to solve. But also like the games these movies are based on the depth of plot is surprisingly sparse. Little to know background on any of the characters is provided and that which is given is so small that you're not quite sure what you've learned.Jovovich does what she does best which is look attractive in spite of being covered in dirt and taking on all comers in this world. While turning in some solid performances in various dramas it is in action films that she's made a name for herself, most notably the RESIDENT EVIL films. Having made six films in that series it appears that she and husband Paul W. S. Anderson are going to attempt the same success with this film. Yes, the end of the movie does leave room open for a sequel. Director Anderson has plenty of experience in the game to film genre. His second major directorial effort was MORTAL KOMBAT and he directed 4 of the RESIDENT EVIL films.On the plus side the film offers a ton of action and an easy enough plot to follow and not get lost on. On the bad side that plot is thin but then that's never been a concern of fans of the genre. The other negative is perhaps a pet peeve of mine and that's the overuse of CGI. Yes, I understand that a movie like this featuring these sort of creatures must use CGI (Computer Graphic Images) to accomplish making these creatures seem real, but Hollywood in recent years has chosen to litter nearly every film, and in particular the action genre, with far too much of it. So much so that you begin to wonder how soon they'll just make movies with actors at all. Some are already being made by the same people responsible for the graphics in video games.All in all the film was fun and with the exception of perhaps a few words acceptable for most families to watch together. A few scenes are creepy enough that young children might have some problems but an attentive parent can always cover eyes when moments like that pop up. While I enjoyed the movie I'm not likely to add it to my collection. It was fun but not one I'd likely watch repeatedly.",Monster Hunter
27,jewelch,worth watching,7,11 March 2021,"Parents need to know that Monster Hunter is a violent video game-based action/fantasy adventure in which a group of soldiers ends up crossing into another dimension, where giant carnivorous monsters kill the few humans around. The captain of the Ranger unit, played by Milla Jovovich, teams up with a mysterious Hunter (Tony Jaa) to fight the massive. frightening creatures. As in the video games, there's there's violence in nearly every scene, some of it jump-worthy, as the humans try to kill every monster that crosses their paths. Humans and monsters are destroyed by a variety of weapons: guns, grenades, heavy artillery, crossbows, spears, swords, and more. Many characters die: People are crushed, dismembered, burned to death, and eaten. Strong language is infrequent but includes ""s--t,"" ""GD is used ,"" and religious exclamations. The movie is likely to appeal most to fans of the game franchise (who will understand the world-building) or fantasy-adventure enthusiasts. I would have liked it way more without the foul language.

28,lukem-52760,Very Unexpected Awesome Retro Monster Movie.,8,10 November 2021,"I would say that Monster Hunter is the best film of Paul WS. Anderson's since his first Awesome Resident Evil (2002) film. Monster Hunter was a total unexpected blast of action-packed monster madness.I loved it's retro 80's vibe & feel of old monster movies such as Predator & Aliens & Tremors for example & abit of Mad Max: Fury Road thrown in for good measure. The score was awesome & retro arcade video-game sounding.If you want a tough action hero lady then Milla Jovovich is probably the best out there. Milla kicked ass all through the Resident Evil franchise & here she's probably the best she's been as a full-on action lead. Milla plays tough, trained & heroic Captain Artemis who with her team on a mission, get engulfed by a huge sandstorm & magically end up in another world. A monster world where humans are warriors & battle huge deadly monsters that roam the desert land. The setting is ""Mad Max"" & ""Tremors"" style desert landscapes & the movie is totally retro in an 80's style except for the CGI monsters of course but they look Awesome.Milla ends up teamed with a survivor from a warrior team that ride huge pirate ships through the sand as a ship would the sea, the warrior is known as Hunter & is played by the kick-ass Tony Jaa, who is Awesome in this part. The two build a friendship out of survival & make a good team. The Awesome Legendary Ron Perlman (Hellboy) is here too & perfectly cast as the Admiral, leader of the team & ship Captain & Perlman is so at home in this type of fantasy world. Perlman was the perfect choice for the role of the Admiral, that truly was perfect casting & just seeing his rugged face in another B-movie, fantasy type of film is so comforting & just feels right.All the creatures in this action-packed monster flick are all really deadly with spikes & shells & stingers, those are the spider-like scorpion ones & there's huge dragon types & all done really greatly even if they are CGI creations.I totally enjoyed Monster Hunter & it really was a big pleasant surprise.An Awesome retro creature feature with two Awesome leads with Milla Jovovich & Tony Jaa.",Monster Hunter
29,joiningjt,AN ALL OUT ACTION film without all the pompous character building and boring plot crap!!!,10,7 March 2021,I'm soooooooo tired of the slow burn which means BORING movies that take 2 hours for character development sometimes I just want brain numbing CGI action flick with corny funny dialogue. Its obvious from the title what its suppose to be and it does exactly that!! We get GREAT monsters and we get GREAT hunters. To the morons who give this less than a 6 quit watching these great movies and go watch some Shakespeare garbage!! All I can say is BRING on the sequel!!!!!!!!,Monster Hunter
30,Pairic,Great Fun!,7,28 June 2021,"Monster Hunter: U. S Rangers led by Captain Artemis (Mila Jovovich) are transported to a Desert World where monsters co-exist with humans. Artemis and her troops are attacked by a giant horned creature (Diablos) which travels through the sand as if it were water. Gaining shelter they are then attacked by humongous arachnids (Nerscylla). She clashes with a indigenous hunter (tony Jaa)but they come to a modus vivendi as he trains her in the use of his bladed weapons. The monsters are deftly depicted: the Diablos as it tosses vehicles about and proves resistant to machine gun fire, dining on troops; the Nerscylla will evoke arachnophobia as they chase and seize their human prey, just watch Artemis waking up in their meat locker. There are also dragons which spout fire and combat tanks and Osprey planes. The Desert Plant is well imagined with seas of sands, traversed by sailing ships, oasis islands and rocky reefs. Don't know how it compares the game but I enjoyed this adventure romp. Written & Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. 7/10.",Monster Hunter
31,ks-60500,Should watch in cinema,6,22 March 2021,I not feel it's too bad as stated by many reviews. The visual effect and excitement is there and up to very good standard. Watch in cinema for this is what I suggested.,Monster Hunter
32,questl-18592,Attention Hunter,4,27 March 2021,"I'm so torn on Jovovich. On the one hand, she is in some wretched movies and she's not exactly a spectacular actress, instead it feels like she coasts on her looks rather than any real depth of skill. On the flip side though, I have to respect the way she has embraced this nerd culture identity she has taken up and the way she seems to legit be having fun in these movies. Yeah, she's not picking prestige films but she seems to be doing things for the fun and the fans and I can't really knock that.Anyhow, Monster Hunter. It's a video game movie and it feels like one, which isn't a great thing. It never really feels like it's too bothered with things like story or explanations. Instead, it focuses on what people want, giant monsters, crazy weapons and insane fights, which it delivers and delivers pretty quickly too. If you're looking for just straight up action with some interesting visuals, this is definitely going to fit that bill but it's so devoid of story or character or any sort of depth that it's hard to really care about any of the stuff happening.Overall this feels like a huge background movie. There's nothing really worth paying attention to and if you look over every now and then you're probably gonna see some massive monster fights or Jovo leering at someone. It's just a bit depressing when Transformers has a better story...",Monster Hunter

Don't Be An Extra
Monsters Need More Variety
No Story
Skips Much Of the Impressive Setting they Could have Built
No need For Big Names
Action Scenes a Bit Boring and Lacking Cohesion
The Ending for potential sequelSUMMARY:Like a video game in the hands of the modern day audience seldom want little introduction or slow paced stages to open up with. Fortunately, this movie jumps right into the action, taking little time to really introduce anything before the big bad monsters rear their ugly faces. Upon their appearance, the creatures look like a decent match to the video game counterparts, only with a little more coif to their looks thanks to a bigger budget and screen. The Diablos is big, bulky, and daunting in its task to hunt, while the creepy bugs hiding below hold nightmarish creep levels that those with a phobia may be squirming in their seats. Though not the most realistic looking beasts to ever appear on screen, the movie does a nice job of using movie techniques to help amplify the scenes, with nods to Alien, Jaws, Tremors, and some Japanese samurai movies for film lovers to appreciate in their new uses (like I did). Amidst all this movie magic and creature development, the movie manages to find some breaks to allow humor, often in the form of trying to bridge language gaps, some funny insults, and even some unintentional funny moments that made it into the final cut. The famous cat cook warriors are part of the awesome factor in this movie, and are done well as they cook, intimidate, and show off their teeth at the adventures to come. I had wished for more of their appearance, but hey they have to leave something for the potential next movie. As for the action that was promised some of the fights are fitting of the promise though take that with a grain of salt. Beast vs. man fights had some shining moments, but were often one sided bouts with little atmosphere other than destructive carnage. However, a few fights between humans had the choreography that I absolutely loved to watch and was hoping would be superimposed with the rest of the fights, but again they may be working on that in the near future.Unfortunately the spectacles are pretty much the meat of the movie and even that is being generous. Monster Hunter, much like the games, has little in terms of plot and development of characters, with even Jovovich (the main character) having little in terms of background info, goals, or depth to her ""action"" packed role. Tony jaa's signature hunter look has the spirit of the game, but his interactions and tragic past are summed up in one line, but at least better than much of the included cast in the movie. I can say that if you were a secondary character or extra, you did not get much screen time in this movie, for big names Like T.I, Ron Perlman, and several other well-known actors did little in this movie and were almost pointless to be included. The story is pretty absent as well, with little in the way of significant goals, details, or even lore set up to put a point to the chaotic action that is about to unfold for nearly two hours. As for the fight scenes, while some of them work and have some excitement to it, much of these big budget bloated battles have little in the way of pizazz or suspense, at least for me and my buddy. Quick displays of one sided destruction, often end with a quick fix that ironically moves in slow motion that would make Zack Snyder proud. They lack cohesion, and without any explanation are humorous at how useless modern technology is, but archaic weapons that should be hard to swing can deal more damage. In addition, though the creatures are impressive and certainly feel like the imposing behemoths they are supposed to be, but the variety of the creatures we've seen in the games could have been put out in more style in this New World. The exotic sea dragons, the giant bird and snake like creatures, or even more variety of dragon like monsters were all possible choices that could have roared, torn, and challenged our team in new ways, or you know at least made a good ecosystem. The world of Monster Hunter is a living organism in the games, just as deadly as the creatures that inhabit it, but the director's cut corners on this and led to a small montage of passing overheads and simplistic settings to get the job done. All in all, the movie just really did not put its best foot forward to make the world of Monster Hunter come to life, but rather make a cost saving hybrid that lacked the cohesiveness I was hoping for.Overall, Monster Hunter may not be a game with the deepest story or the most unique flavor of style, but the games certainly have a lot more pizazz than this iteration shows. Movie wise there was some potential in this fast paced feature, with creatures showing potential to be truly marvelous beasts, some nods to classic cinema, and a few good references and jokes. Yet, all the splendor of the monster slaying world is lost in the cuts made for this movie. No impressive environments and ecological systems that feel alive, but static pieces that though deadly are devoid of the same energy the game had. Action scenes are a mixed bag of tricks with little suspense, creativity, or similarities to the fights of the games which is just sad given the mess they made. As for the worst part, it's the story and character usage that is awful, with most being not worth the trouble of including in this movie. From my experience, this movie is best meant for home despite the spectacle that they have created. My scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 4.0
Movie Overall: 3.0",Monster Hunter
34,Kamurai25,"""Hey Monster, I Am the One You're Looking For?""",6,19 June 2021,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.I'm not a real fan of the video game, so I think I can safely say that you don't need to know anything from the game other than it has ""big monsters"".The only thing I really see from the video game world is that the characters sort of ""level up"" as the movie progresses. I guess it sort of does world building in the same way by having ""levels"" or areas, but that's much more subtle.The movie uses isolation in several different ways and has some clever uses of limited resources to solve problems, but it is quite a bit of just fighting big monsters.I can't say that you'll enjoy this if you're into Kaiju movies, even though it has quite a bit of creature feature aspects to it.Worth the watch, but not exactly the most substantial story.",Monster Hunter
35,denis888,Awful Cringe,1,6 June 2021,"Paul Anderson must do something with his career, at least, he should stop making similarly cut, (to many cuts), equally looking, terribly sounding, miserably weak movies that flop so loudly they deafen.Milla? Nay, the same resident Evil Alice style, albeit older, but still very funnily silly and with tons of attitude that goes lost.Premises are so laughable, they immediately turn to a real unexpected comedy.The monsters are highly predictable, and the whole zoo looks very much like Space Troopers thing.One thing that irritates mostly is the very tempo of the film - everything happens so fat, there is no time for any character development, no chance for any liking of the heroes and no desire to understand what the heck is all that.Profound lack of humor and childish video game level of drama leave the whole effort very vulnerable and so open to any criticism, one may not even try to be serious.What is sincerely puzzling, is the question - why?

36,Abdulxoxo,As good as a video game movie can be,7,6 June 2021,"Surprisingly an enjoyable movie. Mila jovovich and Tony Jaa has played off of each other nicely. Most of time they can't understand one another and they have to find a natural way of relating and being tuned in together and that made for a good chemistry and a very refreshing dynamic It was also really cool to see how well-matched they were in their fighting styles. The monsters scenes were awesome. The visuals effects, along with the cinematography were noteworthy. The way the movie was shot and the landscapes all makes the movie visually enticing. The plot is basically about two people trying to get home and it's not that bad. However I don't think it's enough to drive the movie all the way its runtime. An hour into the movie, I started lose interest as it gets a bit repetitive. Most of time, it's Artemis and Hunter trying to kill off a monster....unsuccessfully. Also there are some places where the characters should be severely injured but what can you expect from a movie that adapted from a video game.

It's as if they ran out of money so just stuck a 5 minute ending with vibes of a sequel going on tacked on in the cutting room as an afterthought!Its pure action, minimal story and for the current reality tv generation they will probably find it amazing but for me its a hard slog to even give it an average 5/10 but there you go, do not go into this thinking it will blow you away, it will merely give you a light breezing!",Monster Hunter

Here too we are introduced to a crack team of killers who go looking for another elite team who radioed in but then disappeared. Where did they go? What happened to them?

I honestly didn't know that before I spooled up the film and watched it. This film is mainly targeted at gamers who played the video games by the same name. I am not a gamer so I didn't really like it much.I will say the CGI animation and cinematography have high production value. But I didn't see a clear plot in this film, nor do I expect fans of this game franchise to expect one. This is just a fun film for the fans of the game to enjoy.Despite Tony Jaa being in this film, I couldn't appreciate the fighting scenes because this film relies on rapid tight short cuts to create tension. I am old school so I would have preferred wider, longer cuts to appreciate the fighting. Also, the only monsters I liked were the arachnos insect monsters.

47,abisio,Not perfect but really entertaining,8,18 December 2020,"Let's be realistic there are no movies in cinemas. Blockbusters have been delayed for months and the only one out TENET is in my opinion an expensive failure.
Paul W.S. Anderson (the guy behind the Resident Evil movies) decides to release his new video game adaptation on MONSTER HUNTER.
I am not a gaming fan but I really enjoyed the Resident Evil movies; specially the Final Chapter; one of the (or perhaps THE) best in the series.If you expecting gore and terror here you will be disappointed; this is big scale FX movie with some very well made and really terrifying monsters. Some scenes; specially the ones with the arachnids are really scary. Others like the ""DIABLO"" are quite good. The Dragon is fine but resembles to much to Games of Thrones.There is not much story to tell; a group of United Nations force got lost under a storm and transported to another dimensions inhabited but very hungry and very big monsters.The only survivor Milla Jovovich helps the very charismatic Tony Jaa to kill the monsters and escape. By the third act Ron Perlman also shows off and with Jaa still the movie.Milla is not bad (she is the directors other half), but her character is too two dimension. She displays as always her physicals fighting abilities but never get the charisma of Jaa or Perlman.
In term of images; the movie is outstanding (nothing surprising considering what Anderson did with Resident Evil).The as always is open for a follow up which I expect to come.In brief lots of entertainment to relax your mind",Monster Hunter
48,Neptune165,It's about 50 percent grunts/screams/breathing sounds. Nothing makes sense,3,17 February 2021,"So here's a few things. This film was so bad. I was expecting it but it was even worse. The ""martial art"" fight scenes? I was feeling dizzy from all this cut scenes shaky cam. It was not even Mila in that fight, it was her stunt double. Now the world. I loved it, I was really invested in the world. I wanted more story about the world and why are the monsters there and what's going on. I got none of that. My take away was that this was just Resident Evil set in a different universe. Same kind of story. Same dialogue. Same editing. Same over bearing sound effects. Same quick cuts and flash backs. The part I hated the most was them trying to be soldiers. They just make me cringe when they try. After that one big guy tells her that the only weakness is before he breaths fire, she stands there doing nothing while the dragons stares in front of her with its mouth open about to breath fire. This movie was obviously trying to copy the Alien franchise. It was a bad idea to connect the Monster Hunter world to the real world. Honestly, its only job was to be exciting. No story or characters required. But it was BORING. The first 2/3 of the movie is boring montages of the main girl trying to figure out how to kill the Diablos with the ragtag group of military-like personnel to kill a creature they're nowhere prepared for, And then the fight is just boring and lasts 2 minutes. So many things happen that aren't fighting monsters, and they're not even interesting or developing for characters or anything. That Pirate Chef Cat made me loose my mind and It's ridiculous.",Monster Hunter

Indecisive writing, trivial character setups, technical inferiorities; this one massively lacks in each critical aspect. Thereupon churning out a rather fallacious outcome!The core idea or the source material on the whole was enough of an attention grabber. With requisite intuition & sufficing intellect; the end result could have been something else.Alas! it just not meant to be.The primary reason being a dearth of commitment and lousy exploration on its background context! We barely see any exposition regarding these potent creatures or their whereabouts! Albeit It concenter all its focus on personage but has fallen short of establishing those human beings as pronounced constituents of the storyline.The CGI and Special Effects put on a show occasionally; but the same cannot be said about its erratic editing that had negatively affected the overall perspective here. Due to wildly rapid succession of edits, at times; we barely make sense of what is actually happening. An utterly appalling preference coming from whoever decided to adopt such detestable filmmaking.Milla Jovovich and Tony Jaa; apparently two considerable entertainers. And thankfully to an extent, they have been effective as a pair! Deprived of any depth whatsoever; it is solely their charisma working on behalf of their character attributes for the most part.In all fairness, this might have been flat out dreadful had it not known and acknowledged everything it embodies.

55,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,19 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...""Monster Hunter"" pulls no punches - it is an in-your-face action adventure that starts fast, moves fast, and ends fast. This is the perfect film for an 8 to 12-year-old boy to go ""goo goo gah gah"" over and then after seeing it, meet up with his friends out in the backyard and re-enact scenes from the movie. That is probably why I enjoyed watching this one. It appealed to my younger side, the boy still inside of me.Based on the video game of the same name (which I've never seen, much less played), we follow along as a team of U.S. Army Rangers, led by Captain Artemis (played by Milla Jovovich), is inexplicably transported through time to a future world that is ruled by sand monsters the size of buildings. What began as a search and rescue operation suddenly becomes a game of survival as all of their skills are put to the test. After becoming separated from her team, Artemis teams up with a local, a hunter, who is wise to the land and the creatures that live within. Together, they forge a friendship as she tries to return to her own time.I knew immediately from the cookie-cutter plot and cheesy dialogue what I was in for, and hoped that the CG and special effects would be enough to carry the movie - and for the most part, it was. This movie does exactly what it sets out to do, ""Wow"" you with over-the-top action sequences featuring ""cool"" looking monsters and dragons, warriors flying through the sky with blades raised high and battle cries sounding, explosions and plenty of machismo. It really is a comic book, or video game come to life.I had fun watching this. It is exactly what it was billed to be, and worth the time it takes to view it. Milla Jovovich and Ron Perlman are completely in their element here, soaking in their roles with reckless abandon, playing it to the hilt. Nothing is taken seriously and delivered with a punch. If you are looking for a great plot with deep characters, you won't find it here. This is a recommend at 7 stars out of 10. To enjoy it, you'll have to set your inner child free.",Monster Hunter

58,trinaboice,No plot but super cool monsters and tons of action,6,11 December 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This action-adventure movie is based on the video game by Capcom. One of the cast members, T.I., said that it was his youngest son that convinced him to be in the movie because he is such a fan of the Capcom video games. I was curious to hear from real gamers what they thought about the movie and they all agreed the monsters looked awesome. They said the movie is pretty faithful to the original game with some fun fan-service, so that's a good endorsement!As far as the actual movie goes, the fantasy flick was written for the screen and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. That's where the reviews start to head south. The plot is extremely thin, so if you want to just watch an action movie with lots of monsters and screaming, this one's for you. Movies based on video games have been notoriously terrible for some reason. This one will have big fans and haters.There's a joke early in the movie that has gotten this production into serious trouble with its release in China, resulting in its being banned. One of the characters says, ""What are my knees? What kind of knees are these? Chi-knees"". Chinese audiences started posting terrible reviews on multiple platforms to damage the box office sales, accusing the movie of hurtful racism. Pushing their outrage further, the game Monster Hunter: World (2018) received thousands of negative reviews as well within 48 hours. Constantin Film later apologized for that scene, although it is still in the movie.Tip: Eat chocolate while you watch this movie. Just do it.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of profanity
People and monsters in perilous situations
High body count with bloody, brutal deaths
Tons of violenceTHEMES:
All of us have our own unique weaknesses.
Persistence
Hope
Teamwork
Resourcefulness
Self-relianceTHINGS I LIKED:
The movie starts out with a bang...and a crash...and screams. In other words, there is no waiting around for something to happen.
Lots of humor.
I've always loved Milla Jovovich for her unique look and fierce action sequences. I was a little bit disappointed though because she mostly just yells in this movie. Don't get me wrong...she's full-on action. There just isn't very much dialogue.
Really good CGI. The monsters look super scary.
Some cool weapons. I hear that there are some accurate game mechanics that will please the video game fans. I heard that the director actually went to the game designers to see what they thought of the film and they gave him the thumbs up.
If you're going to watch this movie, see it on the largest screen possible.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The big plot? To survive. Seriously, that's it.
Superfast, over-the-top action scenes that make it hard to see what's going on. Within a 10 second period, there are quite a few cuts which is super annoying.
The movie mostly consists of fighting sound effects and screaming. Oh....and monsters.
The singing...not that great.
I would love to have seen more of Ron Pearlman.
A bunch of characters emerge out of nowhere but we aren't told much about them, nor get to know any of them.

Good character interaction between the 2 cultures (although it was a bit ""white man civilized"" at times), which made up for the lackluster plot which was rushed through in the final act.

64,destroyerwod,Theatre would have helped... but oh well... its ok.,5,9 March 2021,"So full disclaimer, even tough i am a gamer and know about the game, i never actually played it. I am also not a fan of Paul WS Anderson for the butchering of Resident Evil, one of my fav franchise.That said, exept the dreadfull editing/migraine indulging jump cuts of the last RE movie, i can't lie but admit his direction is not that bad in general, my issues with him come from his screen writing work.So i never played the game, therefore i can't be mad if it don't follow it or butcher it? So alright i was ready to give Anderson a fair chance !The end result has me perplex... The movie does have very cool visual effects, monsters, and a great dose of action, it rarely get ""boring"" but there is almost no plot. You never really care about any of the characters or what happen to them. This is litteraly the same formula on repeat... Big Monster attack, human weapons are innefective, they use cool sword/magic weaponery and cleverness to take it down, rinse and repeat. Maybe the game is like that, i dunno, so i don't want to trash the movie for it if for once if its faithfull to the game...But as a movie... you watch and even tough cool stuff happen on screen, you rarely really feel invested to it. Remember the third act of Predator? We got to ""know"" the main character, the creature, even if the third act is almost silenced, it mean something. And all the cast of the movie, even the ones with little screen time were developed well and have been interesting. You cared what happened to them. Here all you notice is the poster, who's on it. so they are your main characters, and the rest whatever.So thats why im saying if the movie came out in theatre at least the visual stuff would had been impressive. I remember Sucker Punch, didn't cared for the story but even to this day i remember how cool the visuals were. Sadly due to Covid theatres were closed here and it came directly to streaming/home and despite owning a 49 inches TV it just ain't the same as the big screen for visuals. Obviously if a movie has a cool story who care... but when the movie is solely about visual effects and cool action, well...But hey i could totally see kids really enjoying this movie, and even tough its not the first human on monster movies ever done, its done well when it comes to action and such, so ill give it the median rating. An average 5. Considering its Paul WS Anderson/Milla combo, its much more than i expected !",Monster Hunter

Instead Paul W.S Anderson manages to ruin proceedings with his annoying style of editing.
If the guy ever decides to open his own chain of express hair salons then he should definitely call them 'Quick Cuts!'
Not a single scene in this movie is allowed to flow.
By now and with several 'Resident Evil' movies under his belt you would think that Hollywood was wise to Anderson's terrible approach.
But hey! His movies make a profit. They're crap but they make money!Long time collaborator and wife Milla Jovovich re-teams with Anderson to deliver 'Monster Hunter', yet another video game to movie adaptation.
Milla Jovovich is always watchable and with likeable support from the excellent Tony Jaa, you would expect that the fight scenes will be epic.
Sadly Director Paul W.S. Anderson manages to screw them up too.
Tony Jaa is an expert in the art of arse kickery and can do all the glorious stunts needed to make an onscreen scuffle look legendary.
Shame then that the camera skits around like a Racehorse with an ice cube up its butt!The plot of 'Monster Hunter' is a dumb one but does set the scene for some mindless popcorn entertainment.
We came here to see big nasty monsters and
to give him his dues, here Anderson does deliver.
CGI is splendid and there's some gorgeous cinematography.
Location scouts and set designers should get some bonus pay for their work on this film.
The 4K image is crisp with absolutely no cinematic film grain. HDR is vibrant, this is one good looking movie.
It sounds good too. With low frequency effects being a real treat. The monsters really do stomp and will shake you from your seat. Surround sound effects are very lively making for a rather immersive experience.
Frontal array is wide and detailed with the cheesy dialogue always audible.In 'Monster Hunter'
Milla Jovovich plays Lt Artemis, when she and her team of loyal soldiers are transported to another world they must fight for survival against monstrous enemies.
There's more support from Ron Pearlman who looks like he's just come off the set of his 80's TV show 'Beauty and the beast' whilst forgetting to remove his prosthetics.
Seriously what's with the lion makeup?
In all honesty 'Monster Hunter is a poor film in terms of storytelling, Direction, editing and dialogue.
Whilst the onscreen performers try their best with the material they are given, it can't be denied that this movie will be immediately forgotten.
This is sad really because the 4K transfer and audio quality can be regarded as demo worthy. This is a movie that will flatter your new UHD TV and Home theatre set up.
I just wish Director Paul W.S. Anderson would relax with the quick cut editing and give us a movie that we could actually watch without feeling nauseous.
The climax of the movie sets up a sequel.

70,p-jonsson,I really liked this movie.,9,2 May 2021,"It appears that this movie is either quite hated or quite liked. I guess it is not that surprising though given that it is based on a video game with a very strong following so if the movie is deviating from canon, and I understand that it does, it will not matter how good or bad a movie is.Well, I have never played the game so I am not burdened with Monster Hunter canon so I have to say that I very much liked this movie. It does not really hurt that I quite like Milla Jovovich as well of course. Ron Perlman is also a favourite of mine and I really wish that he would have been in more of the movie. As it was he was only present briefly at the beginning and then a little bit at the end.Anyway, this is a fantasy, action movie of my liking. Clash of cultures, huge monsters and lots and lots of shooting, slicing, kicking and stabbing action. The story is rather simple but not really bad at all. The ships navigating the sand was a bit weird and those huge weapons they were dragging around a bit silly but then those are part of the canon.At first I got a bit annoyed by Artemis and Hunter starting to fight each other and thought, oh no, not another one of those silly, illogical stories again, but that sorted itself out rather quickly. And the bait jokes were rather funny actually.The CGI and the monsters were great, as far as I am concerned. When I first saw the diablos I thought that they had kind of copied the sandworms from Dune but when they, or it rather since we only got to see one actually emerge, it was quite different.The part where Artemis is thrown back to Earth and followed by the big fire breathing beastie is probably not liked at all by the fans of the video games since it is probably not very canon but I definitely liked it. I whish they would have done a bit more surprise, what the f... and mayhem scenes there actually.The ending didn't really leave that much of a conclusion but, unlike what some people seems to feel, I didn't think it was a bad ending. It certainly prepared the field for a sequel and I for one really hope one will come.",Monster Hunter

That and the fact that B-movie actress Milla is in it are sure-fire indicators of a bad movie.
Still, the jungle location straight out of the game, the monster design and visuals are great quality and the adaptation having little to no fan-service are positives. Some action fights are good, at least the ones without cuts every 2 seconds. I also believe they made the right choice of having almost no dialogue at all, because it would have definitely made it worse.All in all, it feels like the first 2 episodes of a TV series.

73,fciocca,"A bunch of well executed special effects, but nothing more",4,22 March 2021,"""Monster Hunter"" has really good special effects and an amazing sound design, but lacks on all other departments. I understand that this is a popcorn movie and from the trailer I was not expecting for sure a deep plot, but please create at least a basic storyline, set a background for characters. Director Paul Anderson just decided to show fight after fight, without adding anything else. It seems to watch a videogame gameplay, where the main character cleans stage after stage, until she gets to the final boss. At the beginning it works and I have to be honest, I liked the two first encounters, but then, it become repetitive and I was extremely bored. Making good and expensive CGI monsters, without creating an appealing story, does not work. We are not in the 80s or the 90s anymore, people want more, and the box office stats, clearly confirm this.There are almost no dialogues, no buildup, nothing is properly explained and I really got lost, because I could not understand what was happening. Why the alternate world portrayed exist? How the portal between our and the monster universe work? Who are the locals inhabiting this place? What are they trying to accomplish? There are tons of plot holes. There are several scenes that are stretched out or completely useless to the story. The film ends abruptly, with one of the most generic and lazy scenes that I have watched in years, setting up for what I presume will be a sequel, that I really hope will never be approved, considering this huge flop.I like once in a while turning off my brain, watching blockbusters. From a technical perspective I have nothing bad to say: combat scenes are well directed, stunts are amazing, CGI effects are stunning, but this cannot be remotely enough to make a good film.

It has mediocre to okay acting, it has a terrible script with uninteresting characters, and some really ugly looking visual effects. I feel like Monster Hunter could've done so much more since they have a lot of source material to work with. For the most part, Monster Hunter was a survival movie, and it then turned into a generic action movie. I think a plot like Spirited Away would've been much more interesting. It could've been a hardcore fantasy-action movie instead of what we got. And when it comes to the monsters, they're not all that great. The monster designs were ugly, and it didn't look realistic. There's this one monster that hides under the sand, but it looks nothing like a monster that would hide under the sand. The monsters from Dune and Tremors look more realistic than the ones here.One of the few things that I did like about Monster Hunter were the costumes and the weapons. Also, the sets were pretty well made. Monster Hunter is just a really bad movie. Fortunately, everyone who made this movie knew what they were making, so at least they had fun with it.

Video quality aside, it feels like watching a direct-to-video action film from the late '90s. Monster Hunter is a franchise that could work pretty well with film adaptations, as it offers a detailed setting but gives you absolute freedom with the plot. Yet, they just went to the usual ""American guys transported to a hostile world"" gimmick. The action scenes are usually the only decent aspect of these films, but here they are so monotonous and repetitive that there is really nothing worth watching.",Monster Hunter

Director: Paul W. S. Anderson
Starring: Milla Jovovich, Tony Jaa, Ron Pearlman etc
Overall rating 22/100When Lt. Artemis and her loyal soldiers are transported to a new world, they engage in a desperate battle for survival against enormous enemies with incredible powers.This film was embarrassingly bad. It had some good cinematography and creature designs. Some entertaining action. Milla Jovovich was good here, she really tried and was let down by the abysmal writing. Some of the set pieces and uses of gore were cool. With a couple of interesting moments and some good Asian representation.BUT where to start with the negatives, there was a complete lack of any form of character background or set up so we didn't know or care about the characters. There was no set up or explanation to the story world or plot. The pacing was incredibly rushed, never letting any of the scenes sink in and making the film extremely clunky and messy. The script was abysmal. There was countless lapses in the logic. There was lazily set up situations just for action that was very forced and, despite being entertaining never stuck the landing due to having no purpose or reasoning to it. There was random characters introduced multiple times that just helped for 5 minutes and then died. The action was very forced. There was absolutely no character development or depth. I didn't care about a single character. There was practically no plot at all with no explanation whatsoever it was just all pointless action. It was tonally off multiple times and actually laughable when it wasn't supposed to be. There was a lack of variety with the monsters. It was predictable, and the final act was messy and lazily set up a sequel.So overall, Milla Jovovich tries her best, and if you forget about everything which is difficult, it looks nice and is mostly entertaining. But there is nothing beyond the surface level. It was embarrassing, messy, lazy, generic, lacked purpose, explanation or meaning and the list goes on. The worst video game adaptation I have seen and my worst film of the year so far.",Monster Hunter

The biggest problem ( in addition to a lack of character development and the end ( setting everything up for a sequel)), is the movie was not fun ( ps. Resident Evil was fun). With a Title of Minster Hunter humor should have been included. Godzilla versus Kong which was a serious monster movie had some humor sprinkled in. ( not to mention characters you can care about). Did I forget to mention the poor special effects, and last but not least, I enjoy looking at Milla but here she was dirty and nothing to look at. ( unlike need I say Resident Evil or Ultraviolet). Tony Jaa's martial arts was the only good thing in entire movie who was any good and for him I give a generous 2 stars.",Monster Hunter
79,aastikhimta,Expected alot but it's trash,3,21 February 2021,So from starting the CGI was not upto the mark. Plus the plot is so weak and boring. Action scenes are also average.

80,flingebunt,Great action driven movie,7,13 June 2021,"This is not a character driven story, or plot driven story, but an action driven story. I love movies with characters and original plots, in fact I prefer them, but there is nothing wrong with a story that is primarily focused on the action.Basically the plot is a group of Army Rangers are out seeking a lost patrol and get sucked into another world where they are attacked by monsters. One person survives (it could be the person on the poster for the movie, but I won't tell you as I don't want to provide any spoilers) This loan person teams up with another person from that world who is also trapped by the monsters, and much monster fighting ensures.Basically, you get original action that drives the story forward. There are lots of bad action movies where the action is just action for action's sake, but here the relationships between the characters are developed through action sequences, as is our understanding of the world. There is no break for pointless dialogue, and this is the sort of movie action fans will love.",Monster Hunter
81,flicklover,It is what it is.....,5,23 January 2021,"I am not a fan of films based on video games. Most action films these days already feel like video games so why would we expect films based on video games to be any better? Because there is virtually NOTHING decent to see in a theater these days I decided to go see this with very low expectations. I know I can see just about anything at home streaming but I still would rather see a film in a movie theater.Story? Forget that!!! Milla Jovovich stars as army Captain Artemis of a squad of soldiers who are in a desert and suddenly go into a portal. They are slaughtered by savage monsters. Jovovich lives and befriends the Hunter, played by Tony Jaa.
Apparently, he is the main character in the video games but the Jovovich character is the main one here. The film has virtually no story. Very little dialogue. A staple of this type of film. Alot of CG monster creating havoc and Jovovich kicking butt. That's it.Monster Hunter is pretty much what I thought it would be. Big, dumb and at best moderately entertaining. I expecting not to like it, but I did enough to have an average time.Grade: C",Monster Hunter
82,mike-c-b,One big fingersign to the viewer,3,6 March 2021,"Great to see Milla Jovovich and Tony Jaa together in a movie, but they are with amateurs.All fight scenes involving Tony Jaa are zoomed in with shakey-cam (which is typically used to make bad fight scenes look good), so you miss all of Tony's expert fighting.All monsters are technically animated expertly, but you miss it all (shakey cam and 1 sec cut scenes), and the drama of first discovering them, as the director just ""throws"" them at you with doom/panic music. The monsters just look menacing towards the camera with no will of their own, like they're posing for a photoshoot, and you're supposed to be frightened because of the thriller music (which is forced on you).",Monster Hunter

I'm in agreement that its non-existent and dialogue is cheesy. However this directors films are mainly aiming to be big budget action packed films. Thats where this film, along with his others that plagued with bad reviews shine. Thats why I still don't understand why people will complain when they should know that already.Back to my review, this movie way exceeded my expectations. The acting cast was good, the cgi was ok, and the action was extreme and relentless. The movie never felt draggy at all either. The only reason why I diddn't give this movie a 10 was due to the ending. I just hate more then anything when action movies have abrupt endings like that.I would def recommend this movie nonetheless to action afficiendos that are looking for something new and exciting to watch that doesn't look low budget like most of movies coming out lately.",Monster Hunter

85,movieman6-413-929510,Paul W.S. Anderson is filming yet another video game series in a bad way.,4,6 December 2020,"Monster Hunter is a new fantasy action film directed, written, and produced in part by Paul W.S. Anderson, the director of Resident Evil and Event Horizon.In the film, Captain Artemis (Milla Jovovich) and her military unit are transported to another world thanks to a strange storm. In this world they are attacked by dangerous, gigantic monsters, which they find difficult to stop with their military weapons. When Artemis meets the mysterious Hunter, she learns that every monster can be defeated in some way. Artemis decides to team up with Hunter to defeat the monsters and hopefully find a way back to her own world.Paul W.S. Anderson closed the film adaptations of the Resident Evil video game series in 2016. With this film he seems to have started a new video game series filming. Most video game adaptations turn out badly and are often more entertaining for those familiar with the video game the movie is based on. Unfortunately, this is also the case for this film, because the film lacks a real story and clear explanation of what exactly happened in the film. People familiar with the video game or playing it themselves can probably understand this movie a little better.Paul W.S. Anderson has put this film together with editor Doobie White in a messy way, just like he did with his last Resident Evil film. The film jumps from short, moving action scene to the next. This only makes the movie more difficult to follow and because the movie is in 3D this can lead to headaches for some people. They also use a lot of unnecessary slow motion effects, to convey the movie more exciting, but unfortunately the slow motion only makes the movie unnecessarily long-winded. The monsters in the film look good, but you can see that they were placed in the film with CGI, so they do not all come across as credible.The acting is not very prominent either, because no character gets a clear background story, structure or further development in the film. When a monster attacks the group and there are victims, you don't know exactly who they were.",Monster Hunter
86,CountJonnie,Rips off too many decent movies,3,22 August 2021,"Paul Anderson has always been polarizing. Yet, he turned me into a fan with Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon and Death Race, because at least he always delivers amazing cinematography, good action and in these cases at least some consistency.But with Monster Hunter all that is gone. Monster Hunter just grabs some scenes that are a blatant rip off from Descent, Pitch Black, LotR, Tremors and so many more. Without counterbalance in the form of comedic relief, enjoyable fight scenes or likable characters (not even Ron Perlman pulls it off), this movie is simply an insult.",Monster Hunter
87,leesimon-26357,I'm ready for this to be the next Resident Evil series,8,24 February 2021,"There's a lot about this movie that was very corny, and I could see people not wanting to stick it through past the first half-hour. Some of the dialogue is pretty dumb, and lazily written. The movie solves this by having more than half of its run time with 2 main characters that don't speak the same language, therefore; no dialogue.
There are some cheesy scenes before the action gets started. However, once the monsters make an appearance, this gets very cool. Just in terms of the graphics alone, the monsters look great, move great and are definitely threatening.
The movie sets up this universe of monsters well, and follows its own internal logic, which is always nice in movies.
If want you are looking for is a monster movie, with scary monsters that look good; this is it. I'm completely in for this to become the new Resident Evil series. I will definitely see this movie again. Highly recommended to people who just want to see ""warriors"" fight monsters. If that's your jam, this is your movie.",Monster Hunter

Milla Jovovich, is all and in every scene, rest of cast hardly used or put to use.A complete disappointment.",Monster Hunter
91,darkreignn,Meh Hunter,5,9 January 2021,"As a big fan of Milla Jovovich, and especially of her ""Resident Evil"" films, I was excited about watching this movie. All I wanted was a big, dumb action film, and in a way I got that, but in all the wrong areas.Let's get this out of the way: Milla Jovovich is great in this movie. She's always convincing as a badass action hero, and in ""Monster Hunter"" she gets her time to shine with hand-to-hand combat, giant guns, and dual-handed swords. It's all pretty cool stuff, and seeing her throw down with impossibly large monsters was, at times, thrilling. However, this leads me into some negatives.A large majority of the action in this movie was unfortunately filmed, or at least portrayed, in darkness. In movie talk, that means they were attempting to save money on CGI. I would've been okay with this if only one or two scenes were shown in darkness, but a large majority of ""Monster Hunter's"" action sequences are shot like this, and consequently, too dark to enjoy. You can't tell what's happening, which is a shame because the only reason you're watching this movie is to watch people fight monsters.That said, when the action is visible, it is stunning. There's a lot of cool sequences with flaming swords, and a lot of slow motion shots of Milla wreaking havoc on her opponents, which I thought was fun to watch. Also, the action is pretty gory, and the movie took some risks for a PG-13 film. Filled with decapitations, impalements, and even a little body horror, I definitely wouldn't let my child watch this.It pains me to say this, but there isn't nearly enough action in this movie to satisfy. A large majority of this movie follows people walking from one location to the next, and there's no way around this so I'll just say it: It's boring to watch. For the first hour or so of this movie, you'll see people walk around the desert - it's so uninteresting visually and thematically that I found myself falling asleep in the theatre.There's also barely any plot in this movie, which would be fine if the action was plentiful, but it isn't. At the end of the film a plot point almost comes into play, and I couldn't help but wonder why that brought up point wasn't the plot of the entire movie; the only thing I can think of is budgetary constraints. This is a moderately high-budget movie, but it feels cheap because of the astounding lack of action, plot, and cost saving techniques in play.""Monster Hunter"" may prove enjoyable to you, and I hope it does. I wanted nothing more than to turn my brain off and watch Milla slice and dice monsters for two hours; the lack of action and poorly lit sequences disappointed me, and in turn, lessened my enjoyment of the film.",Monster Hunter

Infantile
Garbage, Mulan? Mediocre codswallop, but wait a minute, both of those truly terrible movies cost $200 million each, Monster Hunter has a budget of just $60 million & it's 10 times more entertaining & interesting than Wonder Woman 84 & Mulan, the CGI alone blows both of those movies away, yes it's true there's not a lot of story there but that's also true for the other two movies.
Hopefully Paul W.S. Anderson can get a sequel green lighted & turn this into a new franchise",Monster Hunter
94,kevinxirau,A troublesome quarry.,5,18 March 2021,"Paul W.S. Anderson is at it again, adapting a Capcom video game into a live-action film, this time ""Monster Hunter"". Though I never played the games, I've become mildly familiar with the world and famed bestiary, which made me slightly curious on how this would play out. Milla Jovovich stars as Artemis, an army captain who, along with her team, become sucked into the world of Monster Hunter thanks to a portal. Running afoul with the monstrous wildlife, she allies herself with a local hunter (Tony Jaa), learning how this world works so she can return home and prevent the monsters from getting into her own world.Given that this is Anderson we're talking about, I kept minimum expectations after his ""Resident Evil"" series went downhill. Guess he wanted something with a bigger bite. Anyway, the film for me is a mixed bag. If nothing else, the special effects are a sight to behold. The monsters are faithfully recreated from the games to the finest detail; you can practically count the number of scales on them. While sadly very few monsters are featured, they get their time to shine, especially the iconic Rathalos, and are treated as dangerous as they are relentless. The action around them has enough carnage to entertain with gunplay, swordplay, some magic, and utter savagery. At the center are Artemis and the hunter. Despite a rocky start, they develop a decent dynamic even with the language barrier, learning, fighting together, and sharing a few laughs.There are significant flaws. The acting from the cast isn't great, the exception being Tony Jaa who mostly uses facial expressions and few words (plus, Ron Perlman is always a pleasure to see). Most of the side characters are uninteresting even with the horrible deaths due to how little time is spent with them. Paul Haslinger's techno music is repetitive and doesn't fit with this world (it reminded me of the music from ""Planet of Dinosaurs""). Another kink in the armor is the editing. Too many rapid cuts to let the viewer fully process what is happening, usually during the action but it also happens in a few dialogue scenes. A couple of parts went on for too long as well, especially with the multiple scenes of characters being rocked around in rolling vehicles. After a good climactic fight, the film's blatant sequel-baiting ending promises another big fight right after, not letting the viewer take in any finality. Lastly, I'm so tired of film adaptations having characters/worlds crossing over with our own. Seriously, He-man, Smurfs, Sonic, and so many others did this. It's not only getting old, it's just plain lazy. Fully embrace the fantastical worlds, Hollywood!As far as movies based games go, this is barely passable at best. Given the poor reception, I doubt any sequel will be made. Perhaps next time ""Monster Hunter"" gets a movie it'll be under a different director, will have more monsters, and will be set entirely in the world it's set in. One can hope. Either way, this film will give you cheap thrills and little more.",Monster Hunter
95,drunken_munki,"Too many cuts, poor editing",3,5 March 2021,"This movie suffers from the painful rapid firing editing and shaky camera garbage that plagues Paul W. S. Anderson's works, particularly the final chapter of the 'Resident Evil' movie series.I just can't take it any more, I have a similar hatred now for his modern style similar to my hatred for the lens flare and over saturated lighting in J. J. Abrams' movies. Just please stop now. STOP IT.Aside from the obvious, this movie suffers from pacing issues. They somehow made a movie about US soldiers teleporting to a monster world into a boring driveling mess.The music is awful. Most of the time it sounds like two random music tracks were picked and are playing at the same time. It grates on the ears, and it accompanies the absolute mess of choreography that is the action scenes.The acting is terrible, in particular the stunted mumbling delivered from Milla Jovovich is akin to the infamous phoned-in performances from Ben Kingsly in older game to movie adaptations.The plot follows nothing from the Monster Hunter games, which is a waste. I have 100% cleared the 'Monster Hunter world' game, and loved every second of it. Nothing more to add on that, this is completely unrelated to the material therein. They picked up the Diablos monster and stuck him into this movie, big deal. He's like the 6th last out of like 60 monsters, in terms of threat to you or how powerful he is.3/10 I like the concept but the execution is poor and detracts from the idea.

106,Mivas_Greece,"Excellent effects and monsters, great scenery/direction, the beginning of a new fantasy film franchise, something between Pirates of the Caribbean and Godzilla/Pacific Rim",7,25 February 2021,"Fantasy/adventure movie. The amazing Milla Jovovich, after the resident evil film series and the extermination of monsters, returns to a new film and perhaps the beginning of a promising franchise. Monster Hunter, like Resident Evil, is inspired by a series of games. So a special region in the desert, and a peculiar storm, is essentially the gateway to another world dominated by monsters greater than dinosaurs. Milla is leading a military mission where they're trying to track down the previous squad that mysteriously disappeared into the desert without a trace. Eventually, when they are in the storm and transported to another world, they will have to face a variety of dangers/monsters and survive. In the new world, Milla is cut off from the rest of the group at some point and is found by a local warrior there, who does not trust her initially. The whole part of the film where Milla is alone and trying to survive is reminiscent of survival films like Cast Away, while when the archer finds her, it's quite reminiscent of the story about the alien who didn't trust each other, in the movie Enemy Mine. As in the film Enemy Mine, here too, one begins to trust the other, and there is no lack of humor for much of the film. The beginning of the film with the sailboats and the peculiar crews that appear later once again, like the whole hunt, are quite reminiscent of the Pirates of the Caribbean, while the giant monsters are reminiscent of something from the franchises Godzilla and Pacific Rim. Overall, a pretty good fantasy/adventure movie, with excellent work in effects, monsters, very good directing, a simple but interesting script, a mighty Milla as always and a pretty promising sequel. On the one hand it has extraordinary effects and monsters as in the films Pacific RIM 2 and Godzilla King of the Monster, on the other hand the utterly silly dialogues and clichés of these films are absent. May it be the beginning of a new fantasy film series, something between Pirates of the Caribbean and Godzilla/Pacific Rim. Recommended to all fans of the genre.",Monster Hunter

The movie's best attribute is showing us what a hybrid of Perlman and a cat would look like, or a Thundercat version of Perlman. I digress.First and foremost, I have not played the game, though I have a hard time believing the movie is a good representation. Mostly because, it's not really that good. 'Monster Hunter' fails to build it's character or world successfully. They're just there, and thrust into these action sequences with little to no context. It's run time is not overly long, but I thought it ended three times before it actually did, so it dragged on and that's never a good sign. The middle portion of the film was definitely the most dull. Milla Jovovich does an alright job acting wise, the rest of the cast is pretty atrocious. And so many scene cuts, enough already!The monsters, particularly the dragon looked really good. It had a cool little techno theme throughout as well.Current IMDB rating is 5.3, which is accurate.

I do understand that things don't have to be perfectly logic and we just got to accept the events as if it is a game. Unfortunately, this Garbagio doesn't have any common sense, flow or even sensible dialogue.As a matter of fact, you can recreate the movie yourself.

A bit better character development can help.
2. Use the kitty to the maximum for the next one...
3. Better scene development. Some scenes were rushed too fast.
4. Edit better. Some mistakes could've been easily avoided.

Very bad characterization. The plot also was weird and nothing of the fantasy/mythical side of things were explained. Just that it's a different dimension which duh. Then lastly is the action scenes and c.g.i which hands Down made this a extremely fun movie to watch! I watched this in the cinemas and was gripping my seat! The monters are wicked cool and devilishly evil and gross. You get all types of Emersion and chills with the crazy excitement that is surviving the other worldly monsters.

What was this?,4,12 February 2021,"From beginning to end I had no idea what was going on, what was happening from moment to moment, or why any confusing thing that happened occurred.Having never played the video game I don't know what it's about, but from this movie and the title I think it might be about stabbing dragons and dinosaurs with knives.Also judging by this movie the game had no real plot or reason for events, just here's some stuff to stab, now go stab it. So I'm going to assume it was a faithful adaptation of a game that was probably more about gameplay than story.Starring Milla Jovovich as the most kick-ass super powered protagonist in a limp-wristed video game adaptation I was not even remotely surprised it was by Paul WS Anderson. It has literally everything you would expect from him, and nothing else.A popcorn flick at best, just check your brain at the door, or watch it with 5 mates (once the pandemic isolation is over) during a beer, curry and stupid brainless movie night so you can all make fun of it together.",Monster Hunter

Rinse and repeat.Not only was the story a bag full of cliches, but it was so dull. It could barely keep my attention. Everything went at a snail's pace, scenes were long and drawn-out, with barely any payoff. Nothing was really explained in detail, just some 10 second speech, while flicking through the pages of some ancient book. I'm still not even sure what really went down. The film is called 'Monster Hunter', but THEY spent the entire film being hunted by the monsters!But the CGI...oh my, the CGI...it was exquisite! In fact, the best CGI I've seen in a long time.

This movie was poorly directed and has made so many changes with the characters and story. It's portrays it mediocre. The Ranger squad are introduced and sadly they have been permanently removed, taking away what was good. Their is our world and the new world. The dark tower controls a portal by some evil deity. Mila is the only survivor, she meets with the Hunter who doesn't speak English and is horrible at how he treats women. They both hate each other. Only chocolate is what brings them together.The hunter is basically a pirate, and their ship rides on sand. Their is only three monsters who introduced Diablo the sand creature, that spider monster which intentionally kills Mila's Squad, and the Dragon. We have a huge desert, spiders hate sunlight, Diablo patrolling the desert, and the goal is get to the tower. Other than that, we see Hunter's crew, they are great. They only have a few screen time. The final act seems to be choppy. You will see she is either in the new world or the real world, both trying to entertain us, but fails in execution wise. Action is great.

135,sjarja,Well .. that was boring,2,17 February 2021,"Yes, i watched it ... expecting it to be garbage. And, that is why this review should be taken with a heap of salt, because it is most probably a self fulfilling prophecy.I actually did play the game. It was terrible (but for other reasons than the movie .. or maybe not) To me .. the game was a mixture between a grind .. and a boss fight. (and yes, i do play computer games)The story of the game was silly. Think of default but very dumb heroism 101 .. injected with 1000% testosterone .. on viagra.
The guys have muscles on their muscles and a brooding gaze, as well as a past tragedy and a sensitive spot. The girls are either tough as nails .. or tiny japanese school girl types.They all carry rediculously large weapons.
Now about the movie.
Of course .. it is the army! .. instead of what they really do in reality .. here they are selfless, heroic and actually the good guys? even if they are clearly far from home. (no political statement there .. but it is one of those patriotic things that you usually find in Michael Bay movies)The special effects are OK-ish for a low budget movie .. but do not extend over what a normal PC can easily do .. in-engine ... or in more words ... the monsters have poor textures, lacking movement detail (as in muscle work etc.) and move rather poorly. The particle effects are stock and the feeling of size and weight is off.
So what is left? A story that is just so incredibly boring. Been there .. done that ... .I actually like Milla Jovovich. I think she CAN be a good actress (not A list material, but good enough) to be a lead in an interesting story (5th Element)But she is wasted beyond recognition in all those luke warm computer came movies like Resident Evil or now that.
All in all .. this movie was not ""so good its bad"" .. it was just boring. Pointless dialogue, pointless story, bland characters.However .. i am likely not the target audience. 12 year old me may have liked it better? 35 year old me likes more complex movies .. but still watched every crap .. because its 2021 .. and everyone spends their time watching movies.",Monster Hunter

She had her day and now it's time to stop the foolishness of casting her in a role such as this. There are so many other strong women actors who could have been more believable. This also applies to Ron Perlman. C'mon, enough already. This guy is a fossil and should be playing roles like pain in the neck grandpa or annoying uncle who smells bad and wears stupid and loud outfits.Aside from those two mistakes, the film is just trash sci-fi with decent graphics but a disjointed story. It wasn't believable or entertaining. The 5.3 rating at the time of this writing is generous. Don't waste your time.",Monster Hunter
139,Field78,"Surprisingly good, considering it's another game adaptation from P. W. Anderson",8,10 December 2020,"Big movie versions of popular games remain a difficult genre, given that it is still impossible to interactively draw the audience into a story in ways that a game can, but it hasn't stopped Hollywood from trying. Despite a relatively consistent lack of artistic recognition, the prospect of game fans forming a large paying audience for the movie adaptation is simply to hard to resist.I guess you could call Paul W. Anderson somewhat of an expert in the field, since he was the one to bring Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil and Alien vs Predator to the big screen. Yes, I know, AvP was more of a movie franchise crossover (but in all fairness, it was a game franchise long before it became a movie). And yes, there was and still is a lot of hate for what Anderson has done, even though some of his adaptations are about the only ones that have been financially successful (and thus must have their fair share of fans).I'm in two minds about his work: I can enjoy Mortal Kombat as an amusing special-effect-camp B-movie, and for the same reasons, I appreciate especially some of his later Resident Evil movies (the first two remain bad in my opinion); I was okay with the forgettable Soldier, Death Race, The Three Musketeers and Pompeii. Event Horizon and AvP really got panned by critics and audiences alike at the time, even though I really liked them, but both currently enjoy a surprising amount of cult success. Nevertheless, I recognize the weaknesses in Anderson's movies: he can film some decent action scenes, but he isn't the best writer of stories or dialogues. Nor does he have a nose for acting talent: the casting and direction of his (usually cheap and mediocre) actors often provides ample targets for ridicule (yes, that's you, Kiefer Sutherland ridiculously trying to emulate Jeremy Irons in Pompeii).So I went into Monster Hunter with the expectation of another forgettable creature feature with some amusing action sequences at best. But to my pleasant surprise, this is one of his best efforts at writing and filming, because for once he doesn't waste a lot of time with nonsensical plot developments, contrived character depth and forced laughs. In fact, he keeps the plot pleasantly basic, with a team being dragged into a parallel world full of dangers, and not much else in the form of unnecessary plot embellishments.Some find the story seriously lacking but I wasn't bothered by it at all, since it basically unfolds automatically as Milla Jovovich (aka Mrs Anderson) takes us on an adventurous journey of exploration of this strange world, where the danger can come from both monsters and its human inhabitants. No endless clunky expository dialogue, no scenery-chewing villains who are endlessly monologuing; just show, don't tell: we get dropped into the action and have to learn the rules as we go. Sure, it's still a basic pulp novella (or game script) where stock characters are as easily introduced as they are dispatched as moster bait, most of the characters chase MacGuffins that get a minimum of explanation, and the ending has more sequel hooks than your average super hero or slasher franchise, but I wasn't bored for a second. The cinematography of the locations also looks breathtaking, making me often wonder where such places can be found on Earth.What little plot there is forms enough scaffolding for a lot of action that looks surprisingly convincing, given the amount of CGI that was undoubtedly necessary to bring the huge monsters to life (and appropriately yucky, considering that it received the highest rating in many countries). Don't put too much faith in reviews that say that the effects look fake, and that the action scenes are blurry due to a lot of shaky cam and choppy editing. There is a lot of kinetic action, big monster brawls as well as some martial arts (no surprise with Tony Jaa in the cast), but in all of them, I had a reasonable overview of what happened. There is not a lot of dialogue, so the cast doesn't have to rely on clunky lines. Jovovich impresses with a lot of stunt work that (I assume) must have left her bruised and battered, and gives a decent performance for a change (but she is like a female Schwarzenegger for me; I'm never really bothered by her lack of acting skills).This all results in a movie that is spectacular and even tense at times, with some well-planned action scenes and even some black humor rather than the cringeworthy comic relief from some of Anderson's previous movies. For those who like big-budget sci-fi pulp such as Stargate and John Carter, I can highly recommend watching this on the big screen. Especially with 4DX.",Monster Hunter

Also when audience does not get the game it does not get the movie and the thought in some points have been put into. I think they have tried to put a lot of elements of the game into the movie, but they are lacking to bring it over to the audience.The focus of this movie is to suck all the money out of it as possible. Therefore the focus is not to make a great movie but make a serie of movies making it lacking in the story line of the movie itself but as the whole serie and cliffhangers.

150,moorek,Better than paint drying....,3,27 June 2021,"If you are bored, this will keep you entertained for its duration.It has two major attributes. The first is Mila Jojovich who is always a pleasure to watch as long as you are a fan. If you don't like her then you won't like this movie. She plays the same character in most movies (as do many actors) but we've grown to like that character. Secondly it has Tony Jaa. While he too tends to play the same character, it is a character that we usually like as well. In this, even if not speaking English, we grow to like him.PLOT. There really is no plot. The title says it all but to be honest, there could have been more monsters and more monster hunting. Too much time was spent with the main two characters fighting to get to know each other and then defeating the first main monster.CHARACTERS. Other than the two leads, no one has any other screen time. Ron Pearlman has some but not too much. We get some development of the Alpha Ranger Team at the beginning but they are all killed off way too quickly. Some rather needlessly and 2 get captured but we don't even see that. I'd have rather seen more interaction between them and between them and Jaa than much of the filler in the movie.EDITING. Some people complain about the editing of the fight scenes and that is true. Not like a 2-3 second clip in sequence. But then we'll have dozens of images of the vehicles being thrown around with troops inside but nothing happens. However it seems clear that they filmed other scenes that didn't make it into the movie. It didn't flow in several places. Sometimes serious plot holes like how did Jojovich know which direction to go after Jaa was hurt. Or simple like how did Jaa know how to do the high five.

154,MovieWarfare,"To be fair, a monster does get hunted",3,19 February 2021,"Monster Hunter is a movie based on the video game franchise of the same name. I didn't have high expectations for this because it's a video game movie and also because it was directed by Paul W.S Anderson who directed all the garbage Resident Evil movies. I do want people to note that I am not a big Monster Hunter fan as I have only played one game in the franchise ever. This review comes from someone with minimal knowledge of the games, so I do apologize beforehand if I get anything wrong. The Synopsis is ""When Lt. Artemis and her loyal soldiers are transported from our world to the new one, the unflappable lieutenant receives the shock of her life. In a desperate battle for survival against enormous enemies with incredible powers and unstoppable, terrifying attacks, Artemis teams up with a mysterious hunter who has found a way to fight back"". So does this movie provide the fun monster-hunting or is it another movie to add to the bad video game movie adaptions?First of all the monsters itself look great visually. The CGI for these monsters, a talking cat as well, look good and the action scenes involving the monsters are a lot of fun to watch. The dialogue between the main characters Artemis (Milla Jovovich) and Hunter (Tony Jaa) is pretty silly but quite fun. Both of them can't speak the same language as each other, so there are some awkward interactions, but it gave me some chuckles. Tony Jaa himself gives a lovable performance and is the best part of the movie.The story for the two acts is mostly about Artemis surviving and trying to get home. It's simple and works for the movie. The third act introduces a proper plot that explains how someone from the real world went to the monster world. The main characters have to go to the sky tower and stop the portal. However, the ending is honestly unforgivable as it ends anti-climatically. The movie doesn't even end with a resolution of the sky tower and portal, they don't even get to the sky tower!The characters are all forgettable. The main characters themselves barely have enough depth or enough backstory for us to even care. Most of the supporting characters such as the real-world characters are there to just die and that's it. You don't know any of their names or enough about their personality either to even care that they die. There are some supporting characters in the monster hunter world as well, but they are also just there to die as well.The editing of the action sequences is still quite bad. He does a lot of quick cuts and reaction shots for just a second with lots of slow motion. The director has always done this and continues here even though he has legendary martial artist Tony Jaa. The score is also very repetitive and generic with this techno thump to it all the time. The first two acts of this movie are just set in a desert and it looks so visually plain and boring. I don't play Monster Hunter but I know for sure they had visually interesting areas but this movie does not convey this.I also have some nitpicks in this movie. I don't understand how the real world guns and tech can't deal any damage to the monsters but a sword or a bow with a bomb attach to it can? I also don't get why this movie started with a quote? ""It is entirely possible that behind the perception of our senses. New worlds are hidden of which we are totally unaware"". It doesn't add anything to the movie and we don't even know who says this as it doesn't state it.Overall, this movie is just a typical terrible video game adaption. I'm honestly surprised the studio and CAPCOM keep letting this director make movies based on their games. There is some mindless action with some cool looking monsters which might be all some people want. However, I want more from these type of movies and I want them to do the video game it's based on justice. Unfortunately, this one is not the case.",Monster Hunter

Why don't they use them?No bazookas, surface to air missiles, tanks, planes, bombs, etc. ?? ??One guy dropped a belt of hand grenades towards the mouth of one monster, but he missed. And in one running battle, after it was obvious the machine guns and pistols weren't doing anything but annoying the monster, they waited too long to use the bazooka.

If you're expecting a good story. Move along. It kind of feels like the actors were thrown into Australia with no information and told to figure out. Anything and everything can kill you, but can you kill it? Maybe... Honestly, I wasn't invested into this film as much as I would've liked. I didn't look into it much so I though that maybe it might be a good film, but I was wrong.Not too sure what to make of this movie other than it's a pass for me. Even though it's available to rent for like $6 I'd say wait until it comes out on a streaming service.

It has some awful performances, a bad editing and a weak characterization of the characters. You can watch it for the VFX work. It's not a great film at any point, but there's style and creativity in the last act. And while the best moments of the final battle come perilously close to be very good, with great special effects, the story around is very hollow. Indeed Monster Hunter ends with its heroes rushing ridicolously towards a fight with the biggest, coolest beast we've seen yet. I am disappointed.Rating: 5,3.",Monster Hunter

But I try to give these movies the benefit of the doubt because they gave it some serious effort/work.

The pacing of this is slower however somehow things still feel rushed, theres no character development or interest in any of the characters at all, any one of them could've been swapped from one role to another, several scenes from older 70's films make it into the script and then there at a few scenes of unconvincing cgi action.

The ""acting"" was nothing too.
The director is the worst director I've seen in my whole life. And I have seen a lot.
The scene where Milla burns the wound just killed me. First of all it is used to prevent heavy bleeding and to close an open wound, she didn't bleed at all. She couldn't stand up, that's why she did it in the movie and after that she was able to stand up, like unnecesary pain would solve an injury.. Seriously..It is entertaining here and there.This movie could have been a lot more. If they focus on the civilization, the tower, etc. The background of this whole thing with some monsters on their way home.
The book, the ships, explaining things. It would have been a decent movie about MORE. Not just nonsense monster killing.(Even when the plane was about to crash I said only Milla going to survive. How pathetic is that?)To all the people who thinks this movie was any good. If you truly think that this movie is good because it was entertaining at some points, I tell you that we need movie like the majority of the TOP250. Those are good. This is not.

Yes, there were many cuts in the first action scenes and combat scenes that could have been avoided. 1/2 for acting and 1/2 for directing and cinematography.I personally enjoyed this action paced adventure and would likely see the next movie in the franchise if it is made. 1.5/2 from myself.",Monster Hunter

The dialogues were actually witty, including great situational comedies which wasn't expected at all, the music was interesting, typical hollywoodish though, but had good melodies and had some overall game music vibe to it. Acting was also surprisingly good from Mila and Jaa, and the other secondaries, and overall the pacing of the movie was just right... if only it had any plot to work with. There is seriously no other complaint about this movie only that it has no story. And it might have been a missed opportunity for the team as everything else worked pretty well for the movie, this could have been considered even a good movie, like, as in good action/adventure movie you usually go to the cinema to see.I have no idea whether it is a good adaptation for a game as I wasn't playing the it, so from that aspect I have no idea how this movie works, but from overall popcorn movie goer aspect this is almost fully functional motion picture, that works better than any Resident Evil movie.

188,cristinalinderman,A flat unwatchable adaptation.,2,26 February 2021,"* There is 1 post-credit scene *The director Paul W.S. Anderson and crew brought a flat unwatchable adaptation. The story sets when soldiers are transported to a new world with enormous monsters. I didn't expect this film to be this bad, and my perspective is not from a gamer point of view because I haven't played Monster Hunter, and nor I'm interested. I'm very picky about video games, the same director adapted Resident Evil in which I'm a fan and even though he strayed away completely from the video game storyline, the films were still good. Though I can't say that of Monster Hunter because Resident Evil was a film that one could understand and enjoy, targeting also the ones who haven't played the video games. Film adaptations must have two purposes to give the fans, in this case, the gamers, a great live-action adaptation and also to target the ones who haven't played it. This movie failed to do so because the script felt like it was done in a rush without any serious thought to making it great and I would be shocked if a sequel gets the green-light.There was nothing to hold on to, I kept wishing for the movie to be over, and every scene was unbearable to watch. Not even Milla Jovovich could save the film because her performance like the other cast members was not good but the problem was not them because they are great actors, it was the direction and the poorly script. The direction made the actors look like rookies with annoying acting and they had so many ridiculous lines. It was infuriating when an actor said repetitive the name Diablos, it might be some kind of nod for gamers to be thrilled watching those monsters come to life but what it did was aggravate the scene and my thought was ""alright I get it you know the monster's name move on"". The same thing happened with the monster Rathalos, they used it up in a ridiculous way. The encounter between Milla Jovovich and Tony Jaa was the worst part of the film and every scene between them was so awkward and badly written. There wasn't any good action sequence as it was all over the place but on a positive note, the music was incredible.The composer Paul Haslinger brought powerful synth music. His music was the only thing worth it and kept me holding on until the very end. Such a great piece of music that suits any fantasy movie.",Monster Hunter

However, it's Dune, Tremors, Shelob from LOTR, Jackie Chan, Warcraft, Final Fantasy, Jurassic Park, and let me not forget the special/time travel elements. There is no plot, except monsters who want to eat me...run away! And it's also got a weird vibe about how Americans can easily get along with Asians as long as there is a joined purpose. Otherwise, it's all about fighting and perhaps a some level of symbology with the American being female and the Asian being male, but I'm just guessing something possible.

191,lusciousmuffins,"All action, no substance",3,2 March 2021,"This was such a waste of money.
The film meandered through a series of forgettable scenes, all of which were reminiscent of other, better action movies.
The story, such as it was, amounted to a convoluted mess stringing together a bunch of nonsense you honestly could not even care about.The makers of the film also went way too far with the explosions and general mayhem.
Despite having no special attributes, beyond generic badassery, the main characters kept walking away from disaster after disaster that would have killed or maimed them.
While I'm all for willing suspension of disbelief, after you see them shrug off the tenth fatal accident, you can't help but roll your eyes.Oddly enough, the makers of this film also managed to slaughter most of the characters you thought you might actually care about within the first ten minutes, leaving a very shallow well to draw from emotionally speaking. Alas, the two remaining main characters simply could not fill the void left behind.By the time the so called climax of the moving is approaching, quite honestly, you are pretty much eager for the whole thing to end so that you can move on with your life.
Already numb from all the other meaningless explosions, nothing about the finale has any impact beyond the visual effects, which were not special in any way.It's sad and strange that huge budgets are handed over to people who either have no ability to tell a story or no story to tell.
Not sure what the case was with Monster Hunt, only know this movie was a whole lot of fire and fury that had virtually no impact on the audience.In the end, I would have given it an even lower rating, save for the fact that it will probably hold some appeal to fans of special effects, provided they don't mind that the creatures and over the top pyrotechnics are the only things this movie has to offer.",Monster Hunter

It's a film based on a video game, and although not entirely faithful, it manages to do a decent job putting the viewer in its universe. But more importantly, it stands the test of basic plot and character development we expect from any film that has monsters as its main subject.Mind you, in terms of narrative, your expectations should be a little lower than your average film. But it keeps it simple and straightfoward, giving space for what we came here for: action with big beasts. My judgement is based on that therefore, unlike other reviewers who stubbornly fail to see a film in context, and its positive. The beasts are well made, sufficiently monstrous, and well animated too.The plot allows for a few good twists, and the actors sell it well, I'd even call it very well at times. The production value is high, the animation clear and easy to follow (unlike many other CGI fests), the pacing works and the twists too. The theme music is okay, just a little too gamey in its instrument choices, but it keeps us in its universe.If you came for the monsters, you'll have a good time.

198,xiaoli7377,"Dumb Action Flick; Fun Monster Fighting Scenes and Cool Monsters, Cheesy Dialogue and Characters; Decent For Kaiju Fans",6,12 April 2021,"I'll preface this review by saying that I've never played the ""Monster Hunter"" video games off of which this movie is based. A friend of mine that I went to see this movie with had, and he said that he recognized some of the monsters and weapons in the film. I can't say that this is an accurate adaptation of the source material, as the first half of the movie revolves entirely around a squad of US Army Rangers fighting in the Middle East who are whisked away to another universe with ineffective real-world weapons and equipment. My friend said that the movie started to feel like the video game only at about the halfway point.The Rangers are your stereotypical Army hooah soldiers. They call cadence when bored and spout off some cheesy macho one-liners. None of them are very compelling or interesting. At a certain point we are introduced to another cast of anime-looking monster hunters, but they don't receive much characterization either. Milla Jovovich does a pretty good job as a Ranger captain, and her scenes with Tony Jaa's character where they bond over fighting a monster in the desert and surviving are easily the highlights of the film.Definitely not the worst video game movie ever made. Video game movies typically fall on a scale going from mediocre to absolutely abominable, and this one leans more on the mediocre side. You'll have a good time watching it and laughing at some of the banter and bonding of the two main characters, but you're probably not going to leave the theater thinking that this was anything special.

But surprisingly, it turned out much, much better than I expected.The graphics were good, and action sequences superb. It even kept us in suspense during the ""rock"" scenes. A few original ideas where shown in the movie that impressed us. But the downside from this reviewer's point of view is the way the director showed the useless actions of the US Military. It was a mis-mashed tactics and were shown to be totally incompetent. In the real world the real US personnel would have responded differently, specially if they had the sort of fire-power they had, as shown in the movie. Then again movies aren't real world. I guess they were made to act incompetent for the benefit of the movie. What's the point of the movie if the monster can be beaten easily, right?SUMMARY: A surprisingly good semi sci-fi movie with a few original ideas not seen from other movies.

Made well enough, with a few good ideas here and there, not stupid enough to annoy. You won't remember much about it but it was short and you end up thinking ""hey, that wasn't so bad"". Paul W.S. Anderson has tried to reach that comfort of mediocrity for most of his career. There's the occassional bullseye like Event Horizon, but mostly he misses the mark in spectacularly unspectacular fashion. Unlike the later Resident Evil movies Monster Hunter doesn't even have the redeeming quality of being funny schlock - it's just plain bad in an unfortunately unoriginal fashion. It's nice though that someone took up the mantle of Uwe Boll after he left Hollywood.Worst things first: Milla Jovovich looks incredibly bored and tired. I know she can act, I wonder if she remembers though. Same goes for Ron Perlman in his best Son Goku wig, and the nameless extras around him that look like decent enough Cosplayers at a knock-off comic con. The only one giving his all is Tony Jaa. In my opinion he never had quite enough presence or charisma to be leading role material but he's a fantastic performer and easily the best part about this film. I just wish the editors and the DP knew how to show his prowess. I'm glad other reviews also mention the bad editing, I was afraid I was just getting old.
The problem isn't necessarily that it is fast, but rather that it is clumsy, non-sensical, a-rhythmical and obscures action rather than emphasizing it. It kills the impact of every potentially cool action scene. For example: Tony Jaa does one of his trademark acrobatic kicks and there are about 4 edits in one second, in half of the shots he's barely in frame and the fight scene then continues after violating the 180 degrees rule. This is movie making 101, I shouldn't have to explain this to a Hollywood filmmaker who's been in the business for decades. As a viewer you eventually get more used to it but continuity and flow continue to be problems until the credits role.Speaking of which, the ""ending"" is pretty underwhelming even compared to the weak movie that lead up to it. The movie basically just stops (did they run out of money mid-scene?), cut to credits, cut to embarrassing sequel bait after-credit-scene.By far the worst thing about this debacle in my opinion: the creature effects are all great, which can only mean one thing: hundreds of underpaid 3D animators had to slave for months or years of their lives to make this movie. All this talent, skill and dedication for a revival of the worst parts of 90s videogame adaptations.I find it difficult to even dissect this mess in any meaningful way, it's like trying to dissect Haggis. How do you make such an awesome premise this boring and bad? Along with everything else ripped from better movies couldn't they have copied the infinitely more entertaining Reign of Fire too? I get that studios are very desperate during the pandemic but this film belongs on one of those 20 movie dvd packs not on the big screen.I sincerely hope Monster Hunter flops and that I don't have inadvertently contributed to a series of sequels.",Monster Hunter
207,Rainbowbeany,Silly but fun!,6,21 January 2021,"Super fun and silly action movie! The monsters were cool and fight scenes were super fun!

208,tylerrosin,Letdown,4,11 July 2021,This was a big disappointment. Once again Paul Anderson has no idea how to make a movie based on a video game. While I am not a fan of Monster Hunter I know the basics and this has zero to do with the games. The only real positive was the monster designs and some of the action was good but the plot and empty feeling really brought it down. They could a have crafted a beautiful fantasy world and what we got was a water downed barely passive sci-fi movie.,Monster Hunter
209,TheDestroia,Action!,7,20 January 2021,"7/10I liked the action scenes, special effects, the humour between characters, the end battle & post credit scene.Others may not like the simple story & characters.4DX was insanely bumpy.

214,urbanswami,I regret nothing,4,17 February 2021,"After I watched the first Resident Evil film, I swore off Milla Jovovich action movies.
Still I watched all of them. After having seen this latest ""masterpiece"", I had to confront the fact, that Milla Jovovich killing things is a genre in and of itself and it appeals to me.
Like most of her filmography this movie too lacks a story and characters. It's lazy, a cheap string of eye candy action sequences held together by scenes of people getting from point a to point b or just intensely staring into the distance. And that's fine, it's Milla killing stuff, no need to overthink it. This time she kills dragons, so that's new.",Monster Hunter

That guy clearly, obviously, cryistal, help them many times and even saved her from death. Why the hell she's antagonizing him? Maybe because they were in alternate universe, so their logic and brain also screwed up?I'm only about an half hour into the movie and this movie is getting very tiresome.",Monster Hunter

Damn was i wrong! The interaction between the actors was very bad, like there was no actual vibe between them and they hated being there and in terms of writing, very poor! They even made Ron Perlman look like a fool with his dodgy wig!So, you can watch it but its not worth mentioning to good friends but rather mention this kak to people that are meaningless in your life!",Monster Hunter

221,mm-75687,Total garbage,1,5 October 2021,I had no idea what to expect when I walked into this travesty. I was instantly disappointed by the opening scene. A sailing ship sailing across the desert! You have nowhere to go but up from there. Then a huge monster pops up out of the desert to devour the crew. It just goes downhill from there. I can't believe they got Ron Perlman to do this garbage. I hated every single minute of this movie. I am shocked it scored over 5 on IMDB.,Monster Hunter

227,TharsheyN,Surprisingly Good...,7,17 February 2021,"So 7/10 from me, the movies storyline is rather weak and you shouldn't expect much out of it besides. Humans on other world, fight monsters, monsters come to our world, humans fight them again, Milla Jovovich OP at this point and kills them. However I didn't want this movie expecting a strong storyline as it's based of the Monster Hunter video game(which I've never played lol). However it does deliver scary ass monsters, lots of fighting and explosions, a surprisingly cool secondary character that while speaking no English compliments Milla's character quite well. Anyway if you like action and explosions give this a try tho I do have to warn you that there is quite a lot of cuts in the action scenes. Still enjoyable enough but I know some people won't like that.Anyway ending this off just remember...

This movie is very entertaining and a well made scifi fantasy. I did not know it is a game though, so my point of view is solely on the movie making side.Milla Jovovich is well known for low budget scifi like Resident Evil franchises which got worse and worse as it came out, but this movie felt like the quality of Resident Evil chapter that got Ali Larter in it (I cannot remember the title). That one is really good and entertaining for me.The storyline is good. There are dumb bits here and there but forgiveable. I mean, the effects are great, the combination of action and martial arts are well done.Just the ending a bit disappointed but I guess there are planning a sequel I suppose.

245,ReliableReview,Way better than Mortal Kombat,8,4 May 2021,I don't analyze movies for character development plot faithfulness to source material or any such nonsense. Bottom line is was I entertained and most resoundingly yes. I thought this was better than Mortal Kombat which I feel it's a 6.5 and far better than Wonder Woman 1984 which is more like a 5. Just great monster fight scenes and fun goofy chemistry between the two leads. Love the international cast of actors and the monster CGI was well done. With a movie called Monster Hunter you know what you're getting and it delivers. You don't watch a Monster Hunter movie for plot character development logic or narrative coherence. You watch it for monster hunting action and you get exactly that. Awesome!,Monster Hunter

251,cyguration,Frustrating and misused cast of characters,3,22 March 2021,"This movie is difficult to rate because I couldn't decide how low a score I wanted to give it. A lot of it stems from the same problems Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil series suffered from: horrible quick-cuts, nonsensical character interactions, and equally nonsensical plot.I always felt that a Monster Hunter film should have followed a very simple premise like Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii: some young boy from a small fishing village learning more about the monsters that roam his world after the village is attacked.Viewers could have learned more about the world and the way things worked as the boy ventured outside his village, maybe aided by a Tony Jaa-type character to learn how to survive and hunt down the monster that attacked his village. Something simple and heartfelt.Here, we get an unnecessarily convoluted plot about portals and multiple worlds, a handful of characters who have no introduction whatsoever, and some surprisingly above-par acting from Milla's supporting band of Rangers who actually give some shockingly believable performances, especially Megan Goode and T.I (both of whom I didn't expect much from, but delivered more than they should have given the sparse material they had to work with). It's a shame that the rest of the Rangers were misused as much as they were because they were probably the only good thing about the film aside from Tony Jaa and the monster designs.The other problem is that we're supposed to believe Milla's character is as tough and skilled in combat as Tony Jaa's world-traveled, veteran hunter, resulting in a couple of versus match-ups that is entirely pointless and made zero sense.There's also the obvious indications that this is supposed to be a series of films much like the Resident Evil movies, but I thoroughly hope that this is the first and last. While the monster designs look great, Milla's character was neither believable nor properly established, and her being as super-powered as her Alice character from the Resident Evil movies made even less sense here, unless they plan to explore or explain some stuff in the sequels?I need to end this review because I could end up writing all day about the problems with this film, from the awful editing and choreography of the fight scenes (Tony Jaa fans will be thoroughly disappointed at how much he gets his butt kicked in rather humiliating ways) to the haphazard storytelling, to the complete waste of Ron Perlman, to a MacGuffin that apparently will serve a purpose in future films.This movie is a mess, and if you enjoy absolutely brainless blockbuster, Westernized action fanfare, then you might enjoy this nonsense. However, any and everyone who is tuned into the ridiculously low-caliber directing of Paul W.S. Anderson (with the exception of the first Mortal Kombat film and Event Horizon) you will get EXACTLY what you've come to expect from his level of talent (or stark lack thereof).",Monster Hunter
252,NotAFilmCritic101001,"Not for me, but it will have its audience.",4,17 February 2021,"Honestly, this is a bad move, like objectively, this is bad. It's definitely not garbage, but it is bad, there's no doubt about that.Personally, I've only played the game for about 20 minutes (just wasn't for me). However, I feel that if you're a fan of the game you'll appreciate that the films creators have made an earnest attempt at recreating certain aspects of the game. Especially when it comes to weapons and monsters.Now, even with saying that, if you are a fan, I can see why you'd hate this. The addition of the military was obviously there to bring in the average American audience, but I can see why as a fan you'd prefer if they stuck closer to the actual game and fully committed to the world the game presents. I guess the real question comes down to how dedicated you are to the brand. For casual movie goers this'll be a hard watch at times, the story is kind of non-existent for the majority of the movie, and near the end our main character is finally given a motive other than to 'return home.' But by that point, you're probably already bored, because the film really dies down during its transition between the second and third act. And no, it doesn't pick up again after the transition.The movie offers spectacle in the form of humans fighting monsters, but by the third time it was happening I was severely bored. There's a cool moment that has a horror-esque feel to it and involves a body horror element, but even that is short lived. Everyone is acting fine, I guess... lol if you can't tell I'm actually bored retracing the events of the film.The CGI for the most part looks okay, not great, but passible enough that you won't be taken out of the action. However, sometimes, it's like a bad joke.The editing - What the heck was that about? Whoever strung this movie together is insane! It's edited so poorly the person in charge of this aspect should be locked up for good.So, is this a 'bad-good movie' or just a bad movie? Personally, I'd say just bad, but I think for some people it may be the former. I guess it comes down to your definition of a bad movie vs a bad-good movie ('bad-good' is just another way of saying ""it's objectively bad, but I was personally entertained). Mine are:-Bad-good movies: Predators, Elysium, Battle los angeles, lockout... Mr & Mrs Smith (yeah, yeah, i know lol)Bad-bad movies: Independence Day resurgence, The Mummy (Tom Cruise), Battleship, John Carter, Skyline, Enders game, Robocop (2014)If your definition of bad-good movies lines up with mine then skip this, but if it's the opposite watch this film.Also, the ending... LMAO! What the heck was that? It was so cheesy and bad! I just don't get it why they ended it like that. Oh, and if you're wondering, the Resident Evil franchise is definitely better than this... which is saying a lot.Any score between 2 and 5 can be trusted as coming from an objective reviewer. Anything above or below is definitely not free of bias.TLDR; I can see this films merits, unfortunately I found it to be boring and a 'bad-bad movie' rather than a 'bad-good movie.' Objectively it is a bad film though, so regardless of which camp you fall into that much cannot be denied.

253,zenjunkie,Disappointing.,4,3 March 2021,"With a different director at the helm, a decent script and an actual plot, this COULD have been an OK movie.
You'd have thought that Paul Anderson would have learnt a thing or two about directing by now. Sadly not.
If anything his style is worse than ever. Scene after scene has been so ruthlessly cut, the continuity is all over the place. There is no character development and mostly awful dialogue.
The 1st two Resident Evil movies were his best efforts, but since then, everything is just about keeping wifey Milla Jovovich in a job. The camera rarely strays away from her.
I do love a monster movie and this does have a few moments in the 2nd half, but ultimately it disappoints.
And as for the rubbish ending....",Monster Hunter
254,burkholdermicah,You Won't Find Any Good Writing In This Movie.,6,16 December 2020,"Yeah, this movie is really dumb. But good lord, I can't recommend it enough. It is really unapologetically edgy at times, yet it does kinda capture the nature of the games to a certain degree. I found the modern setting to be lacking, since machine guns were not part of the style of Monster Hunter. From a subjective perspective, it's pretty good and it's a solid popcorn film for Monster Hunter fans.There is nothing good about the writing. The writing in this movie is so bad, that it moves literally all over the place and lots of stuff are introduced and you won't even know why they bothered. All the characters in this movie are likable, but they do the stupidest things and bring their team down to a laughable degree. Milla Jovovich's character switches personalities for some reason. She isn't afraid of gigantic monsters, yet she is literal plot armor when it comes to saving her crew. From a narrative perspective, it's hilariously bad.To sum it all up, Monster Hunter is a dumb movie with a lot of things to like from the games and plenty of action for fans of the games to enjoy. If that's all you really came for... well, this is the movie for you.",Monster Hunter

Don't listen to the negative reviews .. they are the same bots who go around complaining about every movie on this platform.I would divide this movie into 4 chapters; the weakest had to be the second one, where there is a certain fighting scene that drags on forever and for no apparent reason. The first chapter impressed me in terms of visuals, the nest design specifically was unique and gave me the creeps. The 3rd chapter was interesting and it introduced a character that was there for the comedy factor of it, leading to the 4th that hinted majorly to a sequel.Monsters design was good and the acting as well, the movie kept me interested and invested from start to end and above all I was super happy to see Milla back on screen!

263,Fenris Fil,Video Game adaptation that forgot it was supposed to be a movie,4,2 March 2021,"I haven't played the games and as such went into this not knowing it was a video game adaptation. I guessed it was however pretty early on because this really feels like watching a video game play through. This film only really has one character and has a jarringly distinct three acts that would probably have been better suited as part of a movie trilogy or TV series than a one off movie (Don't expect a sequel any time soon).The films protagonist is whisked from one action based situation to the next with few chances to catch her bearings and does very little with what time she has between encounters to really develop any kind of personality. In the first act she is joined by her army unit who demonstrate a little personality but are never given the opportunity to make us care about them. Pretty much the first act is there to establish our protagonist. The second act is really where most of the film is and focuses a bit more on the movies secondary character who speaks no English and has has about as much personality as our protagonist. He likes chocolate and is a survivor with bad ass ninja skills. At first he fights with our hero but then they learn to get along to fight the monsters. Pretty straight forward writing but no complaints really, this is the only part of the film I actually liked.In the final act he is barely present and instead we are introduced to a full on fantasy world team (including a random cat pirate) lead by Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman. It would have been nice to spend more time getting to know these wonderful freaks but alas we haven't had random action for at least three minutes so it is on to the ending which seems to have been edited by throwing the film up in the air and attacking it vigorously with a samurai sword. The ending isn't even really an ending. It's just one of those moments where everyone strikes a pose while heading into further action. Honestly I feel like I heard someone scream ""Mortal Kombat!"" moments before the titles rolled.Still, while the movie was bad I did think it looked good. The characters, the creatures and the landscape in general (mostly desert though it is) all look the part and on a $60m budget this is still an achievement. Sadly though this movies legacy is almost certainly going to be in how badly edited the action scenes are. Anyway, if you have played the games perhaps there is something here for you, but if you have not I would avoid this one.",Monster Hunter
264,drfraud-1,What a mess...,3,10 March 2021,"This movie fundamentally fails to capture anything about Monster Hunter universe or games and ends being a cheesy hollywood action flick.It also fails at having a point or knowing what audience it's trying to target. Is this made for action fans? Because the action is sort of bad. Is it for fans of the game series? Because other than surface resemblance there is very little to offer here.Monster hunter universe, if you've never played the game, is a world of peace and wonder with mysterious monsters showing up once in a while and causing havoc - they are not really terrifying nor are they meant to illicit fear by murdering anyone - they are fearsome beasts meant to illicit respect and a sense of awe.
This on the other hand presents them as terrifying murderous beasts that go on rampage murdering everything. That's complete nonsense
As a big fan of the series, I was very disappointed with this title, despite being a fan of the actors and generally enjoying the acting.

265,AngryChainsaw,"Decent movie, but the game is much much better!!!",7,24 February 2021,"A lot of the things in the video game have remained intact and it takes a lot more explanation for people who have never played this beautiful video game, along side with people who aren't gamers at all...
First of all, as a big fun Monster Hunter serial, I look forward primarily to the sequel to the video game ""Iceborn"" which will be coming to PS5 soon, but hopefully on PC too. I'm also looking forward to continuing this movie, since I love action/fantastic movies by W. W., and this movie turned out a lot better than I hoped, because I know how complicated is the game itself, so I wondered how it would explain every single thing in the game to average observer (hunting, assistants in hunting, weapons, monster types, etc.), but director cut it all down in a malicious way it all down in a malicious way, through a journey through dimensions. I'm aware that movie doesn't deserve the grade that I gave him, but as a big fan of ""Resident Evil"" and Mila Jovovich, who cames from the country where I've lived for years (the Serbia), I can't help but resist the temptation and I can't wait for the sequel to this series, both - on my gaming mouse&keyboard and on DualSense controller, but also on the big screen.
Can you remember only of the first movie after the adaptation of the video game ""Resident Evil"", although none of his successors have ever faithfully captivated the video game itself, but I am simply a fan of fiction, both: epic and scientific, and the horror genre itself in all forms of art. And this movie like many others before which are directed from the story of some video games franchise, for the 'who knows how many' time, makes it clear to everyone that the video games that many movies been made by their, are far better than those movies, and I think that one day both video games, as well as photography and comics, will enter in one of the main branches of ART!!!",Monster Hunter

4: All over cinematography is best.
5: You will see too many cool weapons that include the weapons of old civilization & the weapons of the modern era that are best introduced in this movie.
6: The beginning 5 minutes of Monster Hunter were the best. The opening was kind of Wow.Bad Points:1: The plot of the Monster Hunter movie was so thin. There were too many important things that are not explained in the movie. The start of the movie was quite the best but after that, the main characters faced the adventure too soon without even a break of a few seconds which was annoying.2: The movie has non-stop action without a pause even the mythology from the monster hunter video game series is minimized as the heroes are too busy fighting off creature after creature. The all-over movie was super fast.3: There was not much character development to speak of. They don't even show us the character's motives, personalities, backgrounds, etc.4: There were so many cuts in the action sequence. There was not even a second long continuous sequence in a fighting scene.So if you love watching action & monsters movies then you should watch the Monster Hunter movie.

The movie is intended to be a mindless action flick with lots of action and very little plot or character development. I understand many people's negative reaction (especially gamers) to the movie since it's not true to the game (I'm a video game developer). But, I suppose these liberties are often taken when going from one medium to another in an effort to appeal to a larger mainstream audience. I myself would have enjoyed seeing more fight scenes with traditional in-game Monster Hunter style weapons and tactics then military tanks and rocket launchers. But, then again when was the last time Hollywood made a decent movie from a video game and stayed true to the original source? In these endeavors, Hollywood drops the ball more often than not in the same way they usually butcher movie projects inspired from literature.

This movie is action on energy drinks. It often reminded me of Pandorum, which was a seizure risk (in good ways).The CGI, and there's a lot of it, is mostly good, sometimes amazing and sometimes meh. I found myself pulled out of the moment on a few occasions by the excessive and obvious CGI, particularly in the grand landscapes. Is it a complement to say this is a video game quality movie, if I mean a really, really good video game?It's a patchwork of high quality cutscenes with professional actors and dialogue that's...well, it's what you'd expect from a video game, although not quite what you expect in cinema. Cliches abound with lackluster dialogue on more than one occasion. Normally I would ding a rating more for dumbed down dialogue, but this movie chose to lighten the load, swapping most of the dialogue for heart-pounding fight scenes, and it is better off for it. The lack of plot exposition seemed at first like a flaw, but the further the story progressed the more obvious it became that this was a good decision. This is a paper thin video game premise and trying to beef up the explanation could very well have come off dopey and even less believable. Best to just sit back and enjoy and don't think too hard.If you're an action buff, see it.

Slight spoilers belowI guess I do as someone said this was not helpful. If you seen Rein of Fire you have seen the monster/dragon here, exact same, visuals, and vulnerability. If you have seen Pitch Black you have seen the concept, and vulnerability of the spiders, but visually they remind you of the spiders from The Mist, including inflicting the exact same body horror. If you have seen Dune, then you have seen the concept for the Diablo which acts like a sand worm.

I wasn't so impressed with the led character's acting so I felt supporting rolls from T.I , Meagan good and Tony Jaa would help out great in the filming but they messed up this great film by killing our two great characters before the action started...That's a messed up thing to do.I chose to see this film because of Tony Jaa, Meagan Good and T.I but the director broke my heart, my interest went from 100 to 40 after they killed T.I and Meagan Good",Monster Hunter

Movies like this are intended to be wild, escapist rides, and in that, the movie succeeds. And besides, Milla Jovovich has pretty much cornered the market on kick-ass woman roles.Yes, it gets pretty derivative in places, with many things clearly inspired by ""Aliens"", ""Pitch Black"", and ""Predator"", but it does those things well enough to still be entertaining. You also have to set aside a critical eye towards the fight scenes, as neither character would have lasted through the beatings they each took for more than a couple of minutes.

339,MTZink,Stunningly Educational Treatise on Physics And Blunt Force Effects on Human Bodies,5,6 March 2021,"Wow. Beyond the action adventure, an unexpected series of revelations.
S'cuse the long title but, like all complex scientific studies, it takes a few words just to describe what da heck is being discussed. First, should you watch this?1. Stormy Saturday, time to watch a movie. Have Amazon & Netflix but no interest to wade through searching around. Let's Just Get To It. MH on radar for one day; this the day as fit preference mood.
2. Rental not that expensive; shrug. Problematic. If budget tight, wait a bit.
3. Well aware of GENERAL reviews, particularly the negatives about, go figure, not staying close to source material of video game. Never aware of this game so not an issue. Some specific refs, if any, could not be recognized but zero feel one had to be aware of the game to ""appreciate"" this film. Would have no clue it ever WAS based on a game if not reading elsewhere so went in treating it as a standalone piece and no prob there. However, those expecting close homage to the game will be miffed as reviews show, although no idea of scope.
4. Good concept descends into comic book silliness (esp as THEY take it all seriously); about as expected. Began getting distracted towards the end; usual yada-yada action template.
5. Overall enjoyed it w/o being too impressed. Better than wasting time with some others as long as you go into it with reasonable expectations.
6. Speaking of tropes, run time would be 45% less w/o all the slo-mo. Overused; seen before; yeah, we get it.
6a. Lazy writing in places: lots... too many ex machinas. Tired of combat? Just throw up your arms, let the menace approach and wait for the constant unlikely last-second saves. Plot armor galore. Extra points for anyone NOT recognizing the convenience of Mila grabbing up a field medical pack seemingly stocked with only two flares and a... excuse me? Can of oxygen?
7. Gosh, not even to the revelations on physics yet. On the major logic sides, the biggest WTF grew with the basic WHY DA HECK DO THESE MONSTERS CARE ABOUT THESE TINY MONKEYS RUNNING AROUND? Not a biologist but not an idiot, either. Thus:
7a. Corn Flake Obsession? Consider ANY monster; particularly the horned sand thingie. Size of an average small town library. Thousands of tons? Equivalent of a person being obsessed with hunting down individual corn flakes. LESS than that in mass comparisons. Spends more energy roaring than the nutrition possible in a tiny person. Chasing gnats. Not worth the effort. Further: holy hanna, if that's a living beast, WHAT usually fuels it? What is its normal prey? Large animals have to eat a lot daily so ? and again why waste time on mobile crumbs?
7ab. Ok, rant engaged. Another thing(s): Except large mammals in obvious threat or defense displays, WHAT insect, reptile or other creature wastes time in posing for last-second roars/menace before snapping up the prey? Once that was pointed out I see it in almost all monsters. Recall those nature films? Say of a spider pouncing on a grasshopper? Half the horror comes from the silent, instant attack. Contrast the trench bug attack in King Kong; brrrr! They just saw the meat and went for it.
7abc. As above with the spider colony: swarms of elephant-sized craboolas chasing down crumbs, wasting exponential energy for no conceivable reward to make it worth it. All moot tho, I guess... if the creatures are just extremely annoyed with humans. But still.Now the physics/human body revelations. I guess working all those years in ICUs, ERs and ambulances really gave me the wrong impressions. All those patients got hurt, maimed or killed through their own ignorance, I guess, or outright refusal to bend the laws of physics when needed. I feel chastised and schooled. To wit:
1. One... two... five? Lost count of the relatively high-speed (or high altitude in one case) vehicle rollovers. Throw in an Osprey crash and it's obvious I underestimated the ability of the human body to walk away unscathed. Blunt force trauma / deceleration impacts; all overblown myth.
2. Inertia, momentum and gravity are variable according to need/plot.
3. These folk make Legolas look like an amatuer with stock, apparantly cast iron, wrist-mounted, high-speed retracting grappling hooks specifically designed for yanking the discerning monster hunter up to horned head or shoulders. Without the pesky total separation of all arm/shoulder joints from the 0 - 60mph sudden acceleration, to say nothing of the eventual stop. Highly underrated; listening, Pentagon? (Right now in Africa: ""Wow. That's a pretty big water buffalo. They're mean. Elephant gun?"" ""Nah, it'll be fine. Gimmie the steampunk rocket grapple. I'll just zip up to its head with my flaming sword."")
4. Unnamed maybe-Asian dude buddy demonstrates the proper method of getting flung off a furious towering monster (radar read 72mph) about thirty yards through the air to violently impact with a rock spire, force of which deflects him another thirty-forty yards across/twenty feet down to then smash into the axle of an overturned Humvee... and just ending up with a small facial rug burn. Oh. It HURT but was fine and dandy after the normal period of sleeping it off. Silly surgeons. Why not just wait and let trauma victims ... um, self-repair? Treating physical trauma is meddling in natural processes.In end: Comic book movie. Just fine if taken with that salt; all effects well done and special kudos for the ?sandships? at beginning; points off for not doing more with them. Heck, that would be a better movie.
Cheers. Rant disengaged.",Monster Hunter

And I took away another star for a bunch of Rangers being motivated by an officer by ... all joining in to sing a song in a combat zone. Those two scenes were so ludicrous as to be offensive to anyone who has ever served. I literally cringed. They were early in the movie and I came close to turning it off at that point.

But this is called Monster Hunter!!This is trying to be something different and it fails on each count. When you sell the movie on a cast of soldiers battling monsters in a desert, it fails when all the soldiers die in the first 15 or so minutes to the same monster over and over again.Think pacific rim meets tremors, but without the big robots.

359,orgrabbit,Great B Movie,6,16 April 2021,This is destined to be a cult classic. For the first 30 minutes or so I was not impressed by this movie at all. Every cliche is tossed out at the viewer and it dares you to take it seriously.

Can't really fault it on any of the technical aspects, but it's not like it stood out either.Story wise, as expected, it wasn't anything spectacular. However, as an adaptation from a video game to a movie, well, it was about as effective as the movie to video game adaptation of ET.Not a bad thing to throw on and experience once while board with time to kill and you can play on your phone or walk away and come back to it.",Monster Hunter

The set up could've been a whole lot less...The beginning feels like it should just be a stand alone prologue short. Tony Jaa doesn't get to shine as much as Anderson spotlights Jovavich. In fact, the prologue cast had more potential character development-wise before being plot deviced.",Monster Hunter

That is pretty shameless.,Monster Hunter

This movie is fun and that's what it needs to be. The game you hunt monsters and I'll Be honest the story for the games Is ehhh. This movie gives you more of a survival feeling and I love that part! I also love how brutal it is. I think it could be cooler if it was rated R so that some of the deaths were more gruesome but it still does a good job and had me saying ""oh wow that was brutal"". Go in looking for a movie that is action from beginning to end and you will like it. I see a lot of people saying the cutting is everywhere. Personally I didn't see that. Also with my review I saw it with my wife and her friend who both came out of the theater saying they really liked it and started asking me questions about the game. Don't over think the movie. This movie is better then the last few resident evil movies but is the same type of deal. Go in because you wanna see some action and be entertained!",Monster Hunter

This is mostly just people fighting monsters, and occasionally each other, and as far as that goes it's not bad. Good special effects and scary monsters are the meat on a minimal skeleton of a story but that's really all you need to enjoy the almost non-stop, (and sometimes tedious) action. Don't look for any deep thinking here, but the alternate-world idea is fun, and the cat creature is REALLY cool, although he's in it only briefly in the latter part of the movie.

Once there they are faced with unimaginably huge creatures which aren't affected by their guns but they keep on shooting anyway. Milla is perfectly cast and believably strong in the lead.

I suppose the animators wrist must have gotten tired.Please tell me there isn't going to be a sequel unless it's the Thundercats origin story.Best scene in the film is the post credit scene where the CGI Cat joins the fight.

Verbatim designs which for us was fun- identifying moves, gear, monsters, and characters. As an extension of the game we love= fabulous. Milla Jovovich is a badass as per uushe (usual) and the military song they sang my husband recognized from rotc. That to me is an insight to something I have no knowledge about (military stuff) but was a little extra that I personally find such a passionate addition.

What bothered me the most was the editing, it's just cut after cut after cut, it's worse than a Michael Bay movie. The movie cuts so fast you can't see anything. There's no character progression whatsoever and the most interesting characters have barely any screen time. I found the monsters very uninspiring as well, the creators had the entire MH-universe to choose from and this was the best they could come up with?!I wouldn't necessarily recommend this movie, but I guess some people can enjoy such mindless nonsense.",Monster Hunter

There's nothing special here, it's a man vs. monster movie. The story is basic. The effect are good. The actors do a fine job with what the got.

It extends as far as Milla and group get stuck in storm, which some how wormholes them through to a different world. Where they fight monsters. The end. Yes, really.I'm not mad after seeing it though, i knew this was exactly what it was going to be. One day maybe they will surprise us and add some kind of a story to these movies and maybe even twist.

Which was the base premise of the games.What I do know, is that EIGHT minutes into the movie I'm already sick of being riddled with cliche one liners and false sentiments such as the man looking at the photo of his family. All of this is supposed to mean something, but since you JUST ""met"" (still don't know who they are) these characters, the attachment isn't there. And just leads me to believe he isn't going to live right away.Then there's the person putting their tag on their boot ""so they know who I am if my head gets blown off"". Uhh,... I know it's a thing,... but what if you lose the boot that is so loosely tied.Then you have Milla Jovovich's character putting a ring into a box. MEANS NOTHING TO US AT THIS POINT. So you can assume that someone either died close to her, or was part of ""bravo team"".I know I am biased toward this film already, because in my opinion Milla Jovovich can't act worth a damn. The first RE movie is where I believe she peaked, then it went downhill RAPIDLY. Her acting is so FORCED, especially so in this movie.The cinematic's were pretty good when the film wasn't so dark you couldn't tell what was going on, or shaking so bad that you felt like the cameraman had Parkinson's (low blow I know, but it truly felt like that at times).The end was an absolute joke,... and to be frank this whole movie could've been done in 40ish minutes and instead was dragged out over a hour and a half that made it FEEL like three plus hours. I can't count the times that I kept checking the clock expecting more time to have passed.They should have kept the movie in the MH world and left the RL concept of it out and the movie might've had a better chance.I wanted to like this movie because the trailers looked amazing.

The actions, when shot good, are so similar to the games that it feels like you are watching a live action game. This point is when I decided, that I'll like this movie.
The plot is: survive. The ending is one of the most abrupt ending.
The monster battles are worth it. There are some fun scenes here and there. Also, whatever they show us in the trailer is in a way the first 15 mins and the entire movie. The end is where the actual plot will start.
If you are not into mindless action, don't watch it till the time they'll make the sequel with complete story.
If you are a fan of Predator, watch this.
Cinematography is really good when the wanna show the monsters and the world. Action sequences are filled with a lot of cuts at place, you might like that or dislike.
This is as much of a Tony Jaa movie as this is a Milla Jovovich's.",Monster Hunter
425,AnotherRandomReviewer,Outstanding move...if you like utterly stupid movies,1,2 August 2021,"I don't think I've ever seen a movie reveal how bad it was going to be as quickly as this one. In literally the first 10 seconds, it hits you with some blithering stupidity and continues on from there non-stop from there. To top it off, the movie doesn't even have an ending. It ends on a cliffhanger. Just freaking unbelievable.Some people were saying this might be good as a kids movie, and I suppose it would be if you're ok with your kids watching people get gored to death or eaten alive.I don't usually go out of my way to comment on bad movies but when you see a film that takes it to a whole new level then I've got to say something.",Monster Hunter
426,slashism,Nice fantasy action movie,9,5 October 2021,"Much of the movie is pretty much the title. Great visuals and action sequences. Milla plays her signature action parts well, good acting as usual. Some of them are similar to resident evil. The movie ends paving the way forward for a sequel. The soundtrack could have been more coherent or better in some way I can't quite pin down. I give it a 9 because its entertaining and lives up to its title.",Monster Hunter

428,kadijamarie,Why Would You Expect More?,7,10 May 2021,"His movie was good for what it was, a video game adaption. For just under 2hrs you get to immerse yourself into a fictional world, with fictional people, and fictional creatures... basically what all video games set out to do. The cover poster has a big monster and a woman who looks like she's been through the ringer on it. So why would you expect more??? This is a good film if you want to kill time, watch something action packed, and just enjoy some fantasy. Most of the bad reviews sound like they came from people expecting a blockbuster or a new franchise film which is easy to assume seeing Mila Jocavic is the star but even she looked like she did the movie just to pass the time between serious projects. Some of y'all don't know how to have fun and it shows.",Monster Hunter

Within a very few seconds of the first fighting scene I knew this movie had the same director as the last resident evil movie, just because it's so many cuts, there are not even a second long continuous sequence in a fighting scene, annoying as hell to watch and I can't for my life fighter out how anyone can sponsor this director for an action movie, it's always the same...",Monster Hunter

For those of you who actually have a good taste in movies and are passionate in all kinds of genres, you can easily compare this movie equal to Attack On Titans anime series (the hardcore action episodes), or even Avengers Infinity War.

It gets better, although not much. Gone are the days of monster films full of suspense, where you have to wait until at least half way through the film before getting a proper look at the monster(s). CGI has meant we are thrown in at the deep end like a Michael Bay film.
The pirate cat bit was weird, although Jovovich did a reasonable job in the lead role.
Not a classic...!!",Monster Hunter

435,meshman-07200,Had no idea this was a video game,6,10 July 2021,"So that explains the cheesy, lame early 80's video game music. It was lame back then and still stands the test of time. It ruined Thor Ragnarok. Anyhow, I generally liked the movie, the CGI and monsters were great and it's always good to see Ron Perlman doing this thing. The movie itself was a bit on the weird side and a left a lot of splainin' to do. Where is this place? Where did the portals come from in the first place? How does a sailing ship sail on sand? They kind of just ended the movie before the story was finished. But not horrible, a good time waster to watch.",Monster Hunter
436,adinathdr,"A decent start for most,",5,25 March 2021,"Well what drove me to this movie was the cast. Milia Jovovich notable for Resident Evil, Tony jaa (Tom Yum Goong), Ron Periman (Hellboy). The first phase of every sci-fic movie is about a situation in a mysterious world. The second phase is the justification/exploration of the world. The second phase usually fails to meet the audience expectations. Just like that,
THe first phase was real good. And i personally enjoyed every frame of it,
Including the hand to hand combat of tony jaa and milia jovovich. However, one has to understand that, the movie is inspired from the video game. And when all the characters enter the plot, and the movie unfolds the world more,
It wasn't much appealing for some of the viewers who are not used to the video game.",Monster Hunter
437,enadyo,First half is bad. Second half it's OK,3,18 March 2021,"There are some unnecessary scenes, such as training to hand to hand combat just before they fight a giant monster.
She dies, but she revives, with not even one, illogical at least, expanation.
Monsters are killed by knives but not from explosive.
People are get thrown from wigh above the ground, yet they don't brake any bone.
On the good side:
The second half is better as it concerns the plot.
Mila is gorgeous even after her 3rd birth.",Monster Hunter
438,alexanderwayne85,Extra unrealistic B movie....,2,27 February 2021,"The number of monsters are a little over the top ... like where are they getting their food from when they live in the desert? Having a few gigantic monsters, sure but not like hundreds upon hundreds all in the same place? Not very well thought out. Pretty unrealistic. Just not even fun to watch..

439,laszlo-699-738438,A hot mess that was left out in the cold,2,17 February 2021,The editing that feels like a bad 70s horror movie as do the special effects.The downfall really is the creature. If its 30 meters away and moves at double the speed of our protagonists surely it would catch up with them eventually. But not here. We see it randomly placed throughout the hectic scenes.It doesn't respond to bullets nor explosions even though it has eyes and soft tissue eg. tongue. Bullet and explosion proof eyes? Very Darwinian.And lastly if it isn't even bothered by your bullets perhaps stop shooting and run? Not the smartest of soldiers.,Monster Hunter

Artemis as a new character? Wrong. Only one out of the 10+ native characters being shown during the entire movie? Yes Tony Jaa is good, but there were also other important characters to bring, which could have deepened the lore instead of going for the purely ""superficial"" action aspect of it. Give us story, content, and take it easy on the action.

So i went into this movie not expecting much beyond to be entertained.This movie was very entertaining. The acting of course was solid. Mila is always good in what she is in even if the movie is crap. The movie does a good job keeping to the look of the source material Minus the weapons. I'm sorry they are just to damn small. But that being said they are practical so there is that.The plot of the movie was good. I like the whole 2 world aspect and the travel. It make sense. So was this a good movie? I would say so. If you go in expecting a 1 to 1 from game to big screen then you will be disappointed. If you go wanting to be entertained and to see some big monsters you have killed 100s of times. Then you will be entertained.Check it out,Monster Hunter

Also I wouldn't say the movie is completely progressive but The mila character the movie follows was beaten and thrown 100s of feet with barely a scratch all in the same day/hours, she was basically invincible to which physics does not apply. That being said it had soo soo much potential and the monsters (other than the ones that just looked like confused dinosaurs) were cool to look at.

1)Character development
2)New writer/director

460,davidcbabsthurgarland,Unwatchable,2,17 September 2021,"The very fact that this film chalked up a $16 million loss should tell U everything you need to know. This movie isn't even deserving of the time I'm putting into this review, despite the review being negative. Monster Hunter is formulaic garbage with some of the worst directing and dialogue you're likely to come across. I almost switched it off when Mila's character couldn't walk on her injured leg (appeared to be a compound fracture) - so she emptied the gun powder from a bullet onto an open wound and ignited it by bashing two random rocks together, thus creating a spark (Bear Grylls eat your heart out). She then, through the magic of cauterizing a wound with gun powder, is miraculously able to put weight on the leg and run and fight. That's some next level gun powder. And thank god flint stone is so widely available in monster land..
Perhaps most offensive of all is the following - If you've got a modern day BEAST of a martial artist in Tony Jaa, why use 35 different cuts to edit your fight scenes whilst simultaneously using the dreaded Olivier Megaton-esque shakey cam? It blows my mind that a director would waste Tony Jaa like this. And Mila..poor Mila. She can act. She's a bad arse in her own right.. but some of the dribble that erupts from her mouth is down right depressing.Yeah the monsters look kinda cool..but ALL modern day monsters look cool. These monsters didn't do any particularly cool 'monster stuff'...they just 'got their monster on'.Paul W. S. Anderson, sadly, is giving his critics more ammunition with this film. He's done a deplorable job behind the camera. It's like they did one-take shots for all the scenes and just thought, ""ah f*#k it. Close enough."" I'm starting to think ""Event Horizon"" was a true fluke. But it's likely a reflection of how good the script was, not Anderson's direction.I won't waste anymore of your time berating this movie. Suffice it to say - IT'S UNWATCHABLE. Two stars. One for Tony Jaa because he's a legend and the second for the monsters. They deserve better.",Monster Hunter

We both were not expecting much out of this film but really wanted to see it as it looked fun enough. It WAS a fun film with good production value and a fantastic lead duo. Clearly everyone involved understood what kind of film they were making so everyone just committed to that direction and it worked.Yes there is almost no story to speak of.Yes characters make seemingly illogical or out of character moves to advance the plot.Yes 98% of the cast you either see for less the 3 minutes or gets killed so fast you don't get time to care about them.Yes the ending is total sequel bate.But it was fun and I was not watching the clock while watching the film. The CGI looks really good and there are some genuinely creepy to actually scary moments. Milla and Jaa play well off one another and the lack of taking to one another on screen is not an issue and honestly probably improves the film.

497,nincompoopian,Dull and empty monstrosity,4,16 February 2021,"Full disclosure: I haven't played the Monster Hunter video games. This adaptation from visionary director Paul W.S. Anderson sure left me utterly disappointed. It's a full-bore monster romp that is heavy on action but thin on plot, dialogue, and character development. Beneath its dazzling visual effects and cool monster kills lies a badly written script filled with characters whom we don't get to know on a personal level. The movie's well-acted, however, with Milla Jovovich (Anderson's wife/frequent collaborator) once again playing a spunky heroine in her husband's own movie.Overall, Anderson's take on the series feels half-baked. The eye-popping universe set forth by Anderson is undeniable, but the movie is ultimately dull and empty for me to recommend.",Monster Hunter
498,brian_liska,Rough edits and lacking the writing it deserved,4,17 February 2021,"Someone rewrite and edit this movie so it has a plot and likable characters. As a long time fan of the games seeing some of the monsters in their oversized glorious debut is fantastic! This is the only reason this 1 star movie got a 4/10.
That's the good, awesome monster battles with unique creatures and fantastic combat scenes.
The bad.... pretty much every other aspect. Zero character arcs, zero secondary character development, the first 58min of the movie was uneventful and can be completely skipped. It should not be a solid hour into the movie before introducing all but one of the secondary characters, and after introducing them give zero information or show any aspect other than a head nod to the games with their costumes. That was a big oof.
Second half (should be called true start) of the movie is quite good, beautiful locations, interesting monsters show up to give some lived in feeling to the scenery, still lacks dialog, lacks any idea of character arcs, and then abruptly jumps straight to the final showdown.This game was best suited to be a TV series like The Witcher or Sherlock, couple episodes per year and give the world time to develop instead of snap cuts through time rushing to show the few monsters and location the writing team saw in the game trailer.",Monster Hunter

This one I just wasn't too sure of, I basically exclaimed ""WHAT?!?"" at the end of the movie and that is not a good ending to finish on for any movie!!! I mean yeah there probably will be a sequel which I will welcome but I feel this film was too short and the story is seriously lacking. It's just fight after fight after fight with a bit of vague explanation, a lot of invented words and some strange characters. This could have been so much more. It was clear that a lot of money was spent on this leading to some good cgi effects but after using up all their ammo, the final ""boss"" comes along and the movie ends. Cmon. I've given it a generous 7 as I was entertained but as is this will just be a film not to be remembered when it could have been a really good film. If they had added a bit of story to this it could have been the next Jurassic Park. As is it just felt like watching an hour long trailer to a story that could have been great.",Monster Hunter

Each scene is an action scene with the exception of a very brief character building montage in the middle. The film as a whole is a little campy, but it has a character in the way it executes its campiness. Thr writers didn't focus too much on complex characters all around, which is perfect because this is an action vehicle to watch a couple of humans battle ridiculously big and seemingly unbeatable monsters. Really no need for compelling characters.The monster fx are awesome, and there's a good plot structure.Hopefully we'll get a sequel someday even though the coof prevented this from really claiming any financial success.",Monster Hunter

513,gbanoon,It's ok at best,6,4 December 2020,"I went and watched this with no knowledge about Monster Hunter. The beginning looked very promising. But then it got a bit worse, for example: I got introduced with a couple of American soldiers working for the U.N. They did not have proper introductions what so ever, even the main protagonist did not have one. All I knew was what their names were and that they went through the storm and after that got stuck into a world wanting to go home, eventually seeing them being killed shortly after they entered the world.I felt the story was a little bit all over the place. I found it hard to understand some parts since they were explained very little. The only thing I got was that Captain Artemis needed to get back home. The pacing wasn't really right as well. Some moments were really dragged out so long that it felt unneccesary. Like the fight with The Hunter. And then the interesting bits like destroying the tower at the end, got ended abruptly.But on the more positive side: the fighting scenes were really enjoyable and the CGI wasn't really that bad at all. I did feel wanting to see more of the world, but maybe that's for a sequel. Because the majority of this movie takes place in a desert environment.",Monster Hunter
514,colphughes,Totally exhausting to watch,1,19 June 2021,"The cinematics and CGI certainly took the lion's share of the budget, but for the story, they must have scratched around the back of the sofa for pennies. The movie is shockingly full of nothing considering it has been in conception since 2012. While the constant monster fighting will appeal to fans of the game, it was utterly exhausting to watch. It clearly aims to set up a series of movies and at the same time failed to establish a good backstory or any reason to want to learn more. I hope they already have the budget for a sequel, with good writers, otherwise I doubt there will be any backers after that.",Monster Hunter

And Does it deliver action? Definitelly !
This was not meant to appeal to average people, those who have no idea about the game. To be able to watch the movie you would first need to play the game to understand it. They introduced the lore and just enough information about the game throughout the movie so the action would not slow down.
The movie could had been more complex with much more dialogue and wonderfull lore behind ancient civilisations, story about the new world, monsters and the eco-system, and simply much more, but than again it would have to be at least 2.5hours long and i do not think they wanted that. This is what you call, a taste.
They are poking to see if and how much would people like to see this world come into cinema, so if you do not want us to enjoy more of the monster hunter, lowrate the movie out of hate and spite, because you did not play the game and you simply expected something else.

Just because you didn't like it doesn't mean it's deserving of 1 star. A lot of work has been put into the film and the actors deserve more credit.The film is in the 5 to 7 range.

556,andrew782,Easily the best movie of 2020,9,8 March 2021,"Whats not to like? Top notch special effects, decent monster designs, pretty good script (starts off like Aliens, then screamers, Dune with a bit of dragons layer all rolled into one. Tries to be original but evident. However, as a fun, action packed family sci-fi that has just enough humour to keep you wanting more, it's got it all. Watch out for the little bit mid end titles. The only bit that spoilt it for me and the family was the man-cat. Reminded me of puss in boots in shriek and in my books was unnecessary and cheesy but luckily only lasted a few seconds but like I said did spoil the credibility of the movie a little.
Make no doubt, this is a must see movie and for once is 100% better than the trailer made it look and was action packed from the start to finish. Do watch!",Monster Hunter

No long buildup before the action starts, the movie jumps right in. The monsters are big, mean, loud, and very realistic CGI, nothing like the ones you see on Comet channel or the other cheesy Sci-Fi TV channels.Story is minimal, but that not why you'll see this movie, even without much of one it was still fun to see, and finally see on a big movie theater screen with the appropriate surround sound system.You'll have to ignore some of the physics impossibilities, the first big monster ""swims"" thru the sand like the scorpion in the first Transformers movie. And apparently the old sail ships can move thru the sand too. And the Hummer mounted big machine guns don't seem to bother the monster much, but big!! knives do.And trinaboice's comment about the Chi-knees joke in the movie, getting thousands of bashing comments, really?? Hardly an insult, people are just way too wimpy these days. People are looking for things to be offended by these days.

We know generally where the story generally is gonna go and what the production team want with it, world building, characters set up, opening opportunities for a few sequels. But with all that in mind, the movie bit off way more than it could chew and turned supposedly one feature film into a 103 minute pilot episode.

The rest of the movie is just a bunch of cast off parts from other monster movies. Who writes this stuff? Maybe they figure the audience for this movie is 10 year old boys. I could see this having some promise with some decent world building, but the effort was not put into that at all. It was just ""Peril-escape-fight-dumb Dialogue, repeat""If you could fast forward your way through the insipid dialogue and the ridiculous interaction between the two main characters, it's probably worth the watch if you got nothing better to do.

I can see why the property would make for a good film. Hunter giant monsters seems like something that could be made into a good film, but Anderson is not the director to do so. There is a fight scene between Jaa and Jovovich that is cut so quickly that my brain didn't even register what the hell was going on. Why would a director hire a man known for long take martial arts fight scenes only to cut his fight scene down to poop? This just goes to prove that Anderson is not a good director. He may have been at the start of his career, but after he started doing the Resident Evil films, he fell into a pattern of trying to make schlock while also trying to give the audience a seizure. The editing kills any momentum this film had going for it and makes the film rather dull.

Honestly, if you went in to this movie expecting anything more than a bombastic, OTT, CGI-laden monstrosity with just enough story to justify smacking giant monsters with giant swords, then that is on you, my friend.There's a cinephile in me who really wants to set Anderson on the low shelf, resigning him to the resting place for schlocky creators and cotton candy flicks. But then I stop myself and ask, 'is it entirely fair?' Surely there must be a place in the world for the Andersons of cinema.On one hand, movies like this will probably never net anyone a prestigious award amoung the fimeratti. On the other, Anderson is 100% aware of the movie he's making from start to finish. It's cheesy. It's fun. It's a spectacle, and it has no aspersions about what it is at any point. There's just enough story to give everything a reason, just enough character development to make the audience care, just enough budget to allow for some overall decent FX. Mostly. There are some parts where to CGI swings dangerously close to cringe territory.Perhaps it's possible to give films like this high marks, while allowing them to land on a different scale. A 7 for a film about historical social movements would be very different from a 7 for something like Monster Hunter. Neither film is similar and we expect vastly different things when we walk into each. One can earn respect and inspire dialogues, capturing a moment in time, shining a light on painful moments from our past while asking us deeply cutting questions about our present....and the other can feature leather-clad Ron Perlman, leaping through the air while brandishing a bone sword easily twice his size. That's Monster Hunter, in a nutshell ... except with less Ron Perlman and more Tony Jaa and Milla Jovovich.I got the distinct impression that, not only do Jaa and Jovovich work well together, but they had an absolute blast on set. The chemistry is palpable and leads to some genuinely cute moments of character interaction. There's even a bit of expectation subversion to be found, which distracts from some of the heavier barrages of trope.Is the film going to knock your socks off? No. Will it touch on difficult social issues or ask biting questions about the human condition? Ha, good grief, nope! Not even a little bit. It's probably not even going make any big turns you don't expect. What it will do is give you a damn good reason to pop some corn and settle in for 90ish minutes of good times.It's a lightly-plotted CGI romp through a fantastic world where tiny humans don massive plot armour to battle yet more massive monsters.

They had nobody in the fanbase in mind when they made this crap. I could write a book on reasons why but I won't bore you with all my complaints. In a nutshell the movie spends over half of your time in just pure unnecessary fighting scenes between Artemis and the Hunter just to have them randomly become friends over product placement chocolate.

Very typical of movies and was not the best part at all. But soon enough the action comes and it comes hard, Mila and T. I. play a great duo for the entry of the plot and without spoiling anything T. I. does a phenomenal job with his scene in the caves. I also want to mention the level of action and skill from Mila and Tony Jaa at the beginning which made this epic as soon as it started with the fight sequences. There are some calm parts and even a hilariously wigged Ron Perlman which made me laugh and question the point of his hairdo but someone clearly insisted it stayed. Would've been a perfect movie if it weren't for a few blunders it's still an amazing movie and a must see. I really wish I saw this in theatres, too bad they were shutdown due to Covid.

So, for the next hour or so, they'll develop a friendship, but you still won't learn anything about the place, because they can't talk to each other, but hey, you don't have to, there are monsters trying to kill they and swords that catch on fire when you want, then why explain anything?And that's when I stop paying attention to the film!Apparently, Ron Pearlman saves her ass from starvation, and he speaks English because ""yes"", and explains something about a tower that opens portals between worlds, and there are other flying monsters that want to kill her so bad, that they travel to ""our World"" to do so, but she just won't die, because we will have a sequel to explain all of this

There's a fight scene between Milla and Tony Jaa that is absolutely illogical and stupid. I realize the sole purpose was for Tony to fight. It made the movie very stupid from that point on. No one would ever do what he did in this situation, and on top of that he just betrayed his previous actions just a moment ago. This took me out of the film completely. Ridiculous. So stupid. What was the writer and director thinking? Obviously not much. The movie doesn't get better after this. But again, the monsters are pretty cool.",Monster Hunter
636,dan_isacsson,Enjoyable first experiment,6,6 March 2021,"This will be a fairly short review and I'm going through a few key aspects that are stuck with me after finishing the film.The value
So, as for why you would want to watch this movie it comes down to three core aspects for me. The movie is not a masterclass in directing but it is a good first experiment to showcase just how broad the options are when it comes to making a Monster Hunter movie. This one barely scratches the surface, has passable dialogue and enjoyable moments barely without trying. That's pretty encouraging to see as I hope other filmmakers will look at this and take it in all kinds of directions. It may sound as critique, but I am actually happy the first movie we get from this franchise (there has been an animated series and that's about it) has such a small setting. A majority of the film takes place in two locations, and while plenty of material could be cut down I wasn't expecting some masterpiece so this is quite well within my expectations and because of that I had a pretty good time.
Apart from this, you also have some thoroughly detailed monsters and being a fan of the franchise I love how they embrace teamplay here and give the monsters plenty of time to shine. It doesn't always follow logic, but when the pitch was ""a military squad gets sent into the Monster Hunter universe and one becoms a dual-wielding blade hunter"" I can't really say they didn't tell us so.
Finally, this movie is really easy to digest. If you're looking for something medium-rare, feel-good and that won't have you question much you're in for a good ride. I personally only really reacted to scenes that were too long maybe once or twice. If you're stressing out prior to watching I would presume your experience might differ but I was in a pretty good mood coming in and it wasn't ruined one bit by the movie. Instead I found myself chatting up some folks, taking shots of the film and small-talking. Pretty much what I expected.The cost
A flaw of the film is definitely, as others have pointed out, the directing. I found that the shots would often jump around way too much, much more impact could have been felt if they had more confidence in their execution. The choreography that goes along with it isn't great either, but it does the job.
The music is lacking some of the Monster Hunter vibes I like. A few missed opportunities for music fan-service here, I really hope it wasn't a matter of missing the license or something of the sort.
On another note, the games have very little to do with gender. Why does this matter for the movie? Because unlike the games where, sure you have some gender stereotypic roles, anyone can become a hunter and nobody really talks about why a woman should do this or a man shold do that. Here, however, it's unnecessarily pointed out how someone is ""like that despite being a woman"" and it feels tacked on as if a reaction to our times. It's just a small thing though, for those looking for an easy ride it won't be a deterrent.I won't give it higher than 6/10 because it's just a good ride. A 10/10 has to floor me, stun me. It's enjoyable fun, and if you think you'll like the movie based on the features I mentioned under ""The value"" you probably will.",Monster Hunter
637,waqman,Don't know how they made they trailer looks so good with a movie so bad!,3,22 February 2021,"I gave it a 3 because WIll Ferrel was in the movie even though I don't know how could say yes to something like this.

641,neolestat,5.3? Really? Fans of the Game Should Be Loving This!,8,1 March 2021,"As PWSA did with the Resident Evil films he stays FAR more true to the series than ever. Sure it's got some wacky story about our world and the Monster Hunter world colliding but would it really have been possible to make this film with at least some grounding in our world.I enjoyed this as much as I've ever enjoyed a Resident Evil movie. If not more. From the ship at the beginning with it's crusty old Elder captain and a fan service Handler to the Oasis and the Rathalos fight it's like watching Monster Hunter World come to life.Milla Jovovich plays Artemis as well as she ever played Alice and Tony Jaa's Hunter and the MHW weaponry are spot on.If you've never played the games, grab a bowl of popcorn and switch your brain off and watch an enjoyable Kaiju fil while we wait for Godzilla vs King Kong. Citizen Kane this ain't and it's not meant to be. Fans of the game should get it totally, especially if you have played th games over the years and not just jumped on the MHW bandwagon.This is absolutely definitely worth a higher rating than 5.3 (which it was at the time of writing). It's a fun movie and that's all it's meant to be. No-one compares the MCU with any Alfred Hitchcock movie, and all they are are popcorn movies too. Don't be so harsh on this... I for one am already wanting a sequel. There is far more to tell and far more Monsters in need of a Hunter or two. I hope Artemis replaces Alice now that PWSA seems to be done with Resident Evil.

642,ckelih,This movie is a mess,1,17 December 2020,"This is probably Mila's worst movie.
She cant happen to find one decent script no matter what she does.
First of: The logic:
Marines shoot first and ask later. They act like dump lunatics. Nothing they do make sense, its like watching a horror movie and one guy says he is checking the basement and you are like ""Oh god, ok he is dead next!"". They are in no threat but as soon as some stranger appears on the top of a cliff, they start yelling ""ENEMY!"" and start shooting! Like why? What is wrong with you?
Mila has to yell ""ceasefire"" multiple time until those lunatics stop shooting for no reason.Dialog: They are talking out what you as spectator are thinking, which is utterly annoying and lets you think they make everything as if even a 10 year old needs to understand what is going on right now.
She is asking:""What is this thing?"" Obviously nobody knowing an answer to that.
Someone saying out loud:""What happened to them?"" Nobody obviously knowing an answer to that.Camera cuts: You know they had to fake action scenes when there are a lot of cuts and this movie has thousand of cuts. They do that when the actors dont have the physical ability to perform in the action scenes believable. So they do a lot of cuts so they can cut out the parts where you see their performance is not meeting the performance a soldier or marine should have in that situation.
Its a mess and it hurts your eye. You cant follow propery. You feel like being in a club with an stroboscope.
Timeline: 30minutes in the movie and the plot can be written down on one page A6 letter.

Everything he does, though logical, gets a disgusted response from Mila's character. She speaks for him, instead of trying to communicate properly through hand gestures and symbols. Like, there's sand everywhere, they could draw symbols to explain things to one another, but no. We just get an English speaker constantly saying ""I don't know what you're saying"" and ""never mind"" when he doesn't understand her.If Mila is suppose to be the audience's surrogate, surely she'd try communicating in other ways to find out more about the world she's been dropped into. We don't even get a hint of lore or the wider planet because of the pointless language barrier.Other characters of colour that speak the language of the world are also only given lines when they are made to seem rude. No other lines to build character or conversation. Everything is about Mila and no one exists outside of her.Ron Perlman speaks English, which is labelled as the Language of ""our world"" (Earth), but he apparently didn't bother to teach his crew English to help them when communicating with people from our world as they get dragged into theirs.The writing and issues around language are just a mess...such lazy and boring writing that repeats the same issues and shots over and over.",Monster Hunter
648,DanteLeonhart82,Very good movie with a simple but entertaining story.,8,17 February 2021,"I liked it quite visually, it has good shots and I also liked the soundtrack. Perhaps it feels like a somewhat cliche story and it seems like an episode of a story where the characters are in the typical desert and have to survive the monsters, for example like the Riddick movies or an episode that I remember from Hercules by Robert Tapert and Sam Raimi.
After all it is entertaining and interesting because of the style of telling the story most of the film since it does not depend much on the dialogue but rather on the visual aspect.

The soldiers don't have ANY RELEVANCE on the plot, they all die on the start, so why put them in?? What is the point of the army in that movie if their weapons dont even cause damage? Just for die? Everyone who playied MH knows that they are resistent, but not armored against .50 caliber.But ok, they all die, the MC find a native and they start fighting for no reason. OK!Then they kill diablos and find their friends. OK!
They fight against Rathalos and them the MC and Rathalos are teleported to our world, AND Rathalos destroy the soldiers who was in our world, again, militarly weapons are useless.
On the end they kill Rathalos, the portal open again and a new monster appear traveling the portal, so they rush against that monster and the movie ENDS! WTF???? IT JUST ENDS! Looks like they get tired of filming and decided to just end the movie like that!!So lets point here: that movie had two chances to be a good movie.
First chance: be loyal to the MH series history and NOT PUTTING USELESS AMERICAN SOLDIERS. A girl new girl who are learning to hunt and face a problem (Rathalos) would be cool, loyal and pleasant to watch.Second chance: we have the american soldiers, but its ok, their weapons cause great damage to that monsters, we have good fights with tons of explosions, they die but causing a big damage on monsters.
On the end, when Rathalos teleport to our world, he would face tanks and jets like F-22, F-15 and F-16, would have a great fight then the jets would win using missiles on him. Not a cool plot, but visualy pleasant to watch and would make more sense than one dragon just destroy a entire squadron like roaches.

If you pay attention though, you'll catch the mix of flavors that make it unique.It opens with a bit of G.I. Joe (the recent movies, not the cartoon), has some heavy notes of Riddick, and a hint of Pirates of the Caribbean. Once you get into it, you'll notice the savory flavor of Enemy Mine, and get a Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil aftertaste.Some Hellboy flair (due to Ron Perlman's small role) and a pinch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon wire-work add some real depth for the connoisseur. There's even a tiny, but recurring bit of Hershey's Chocolate in the mix.Now take all of those complex, classic ingredients and mix in the basic premise of the Monster Hunter video games. This ingredient is the most important - mainly because it's the title of the film and the whole point of the movie.Unfortunately, this last flavor is the hardest to swallow. Whenever you notice it, you are reminded that video game movies usually taste bad. There is no exception here, the video game elements taste gamey - like spoiled Apceros meat.It's too bad that the main source material ruins this otherwise entertaining movie, because without the ridiculous slaps in the face of video game un-reality, the other ingredients would taste pretty good.

Which fails terribly. 1st thing you notice is that the characters are in a 7x vehicle rollover, no one wearing seatbelts and they are all fine. This sets the tone for the show.
Milla is useless as a lead, as usual. She only seems to get lead roles when her husband makes the movie. Coincidence? nope!
nothing about this movie is good, and the that sets up a sequel that is never going to be made is just pitiful

My gripe with the action scenes is the constant cutting of the scenes. No one sequence is more than a few seconds.The REAL weekness of the movie is its pacing. It spends 1/3 of the movie setting the scene. Next half is showing Alice mk2's relationship with the native hunter grow and them defeating a spider and sand monster. The remainder throws at whirlwind pace, what happened to her and others, where they are and amazingly a gang lead by Ron Perlman go to do battle with a dragon that gets sucked back to our world... ALL of this happens in 20 minutes. So from slow paced to ""hurry and get it over"".

In the way where you gonna be asking yourself have I seen this scene in another (Maybe even with same actors) movie? It brings nothing new to the table. Main character has same ridiculous amount of fresh makeup on her no matter how dirty she gets, same as the resident evil movie was in that sense. The action cuts are abrupt and annoying. The story .. there isn't one, and if there is it's so hollow that I can't tell you what it was. And all the characters look like washed up bums on the bottom of a bottle in a ran down non profit theater.I mentioned Resident Evil up there, well you are basically watching same thing just with bigger creatures and less plot. I feel like Mila didn't get out of the Resident Evil movies when it might have done good for her, and now she only has one role. I actually decided to give this movie a shot because of her, but found nothing fresh or entertaining here. Stopped watching at maybe 85% of the movie.

As far as calling the plot thin...well that's being extremely generous and the acting isn't great but then maybe that's due to the virtually non existent plot.
Maybe it did get better after I turned it off but I was basically almost half way through with no improvement in sight.
I don't need plot or decent dialogue to enjoy mindless action as is proven by my enjoyment of the Fast and the Furious but this was just atrocious, go buy the game and play it, its probably got better dialogue, action and engagement...this is trash.",Monster Hunter

Mila Jovovich is express trained away and a few moments later she is already better than the ""hunter"" ,she is now ready to rush and kill the only 2 monsters of this movie.I haven't played all games but I played the first one back in PS2 long time ago and even I know that the ones show here are easy hunts. the last ones were the fataly who was a big badass dragon and there was another who was a bigger lizzard with no wings , the name was similar to an Asian tea :P3 stars for the monsters , -7 for killing the pace",Monster Hunter

I like a variety of Milla Jovovich films, though not a fan of her sad, dark, dreary, depressing ""first person shooter type"" RE video game films. This movie, seen on the big screen, was very enjoyable! The main character I can see being in the Ripley/Sara Connor/Trinity pantheon. I was really surprised at the literal quality/look of the film, bright outdoor sunny scenes, mix of fantasy, sci-fi, and ""modern"" world military action, practical and CGI stunts, effective use of slo-mo, and the story (even if slight), of forces joining together to fight monsters. I might not play the video game, but I am happy to watch any future, quality, films from the franchise. (Full disclosure, I graduated college with a film degree, and, though I spent a couple years in the peacetime 82nd Airborne, my bother spent 5 years in the Rangers, and my uncle was peacetime Special Forces, none of us spent time off-(or on)world fighting monsters.

733,danielseanclark,Dazed and confused from the hammer that was pretending to be a film,1,25 February 2021,"Spoilers!!!!I'm not sure how to sum up this film, at the start a lot happened and i was a little excited. Ron Pearlman steering a ship through the sand being chased by a monster. Loads of characters jumping around and doing stuff not really sure what the stuff was but the cuts made it look pretty frantic and exciting. Man falls over board clutches sand so we know he isn't getting back on the boat. Cut to a squad of Rangers in the desert fighting a lighting storm, there was character development Mila was there as the leader, there was a woman who could drive another man who could drive a different vehicle and some other men who were gruff. Cue Stargate that zaps them somewhere else with sand and a rock. tunnelling monster appears shoot shoot run people die, I yawn and the survivors find tunnel. Spiders everywhere who scared of light, lots of in the dark action some of it you can see most of it it's like the character development blank. Mila dies but it's the beginning of the film so she comes magically back to life. Meets man from boat who has an enormous bow and can survive (character developed). Mila and man fight forever both inflicting wounds that would kill any real person. Both find they like Hershey's Chocolate (having eaten it myself can't quite work out why) work together kill spider, kill tunnel monster and then walk to oasis. Ron Perlman remembers he is in the movie and saves them from dinosaurs. We then introduce characters from boat, there is girl how has goggles and Batman's grappling hook, a cat chef because well why not and Captain Ron sadly not the Kurt Russel one, he can speak english apparently who studied the language from some one else who was kidnapped by the storm. So it's not off to the tower to kill some dragons from
Game of Thrones, teleport home, kill the dragons again with Tanks and Helicopters to help though obviously they get trashed because tanks are not quite as good at killing dragons as swords and arrows. Then finally in the most optimistic please make a sequel they all jump at the last dragon hoping to make this a cinematic universe. Hopefully reading this has let you know the film so you you can rescue 2 hours of life back. Ron and Mila, I loved you in your other work but wow hope you got a good pay check",Monster Hunter

I couldn't actually watch some of the main fight scenes because the cuts were every second jumping all over the place.With better direction I think this film could have an absolutely fantastic film. I am sure people will agree and disagree with my review which is fine, but i'm honestly not sure how I feel about it after my first watch. I think ill end up watching it again over the next few days and might update my review based on a second screening.Don't want to say too much around the storyline but I did enjoy the ending, there were a few scenes towards the end I couldn't have guessed which was a nice surprise.Overall a 5* just for the action, if there wasn't as much action as there was i'd have dropped this further. As i said though, this may either go up or down depending on my second viewing.Would recommend watching it once if you like action/monster movies, just make sure you're comfortable and awake before you head starts spinning with every cut scene! ha.",Monster Hunter

749,wwptsxh,60 Million dollar flop.,1,19 June 2021,"The movie had such great potential given its roots. However it is obvious that the movies makers did no true dive into those roots.This movie is nothing but an hour and forty four minutes of some delusional frat boy nerd fantasy. With maybe about a half hour at most of dialogue. The film completely relies on the creatures. You never get more in depth about said creatures.The viewer never gets to understand anything about the other world say for there is some humans and creatures and at some point there was ancient civilization.The ending of the movie is just as bad. With the death of a powerful creature and then the emergence of another powerful creature and our hero disappearing to a portal with new companions to fight it. In other words you ride this hours long battle scene that claims to be a movie. To its end only to have the ending phoned in with the most basic closure imaginable.With a budget of sixty million. It comes as no surprise that this film only made a little over forty million at the box office, and to this reviewers mind those numbers have nothing to do with the global pandemic. However, it has everything to do with bad production from start to end. At the end of it all do not bother with this film and go rewatch an old favorite.",Monster Hunter

758,dja-26954,I own the MWH Game. Overall reviews are fair - it's a popcorn movie!,6,22 February 2021,"I have the game, I love it, but I think the portrayal into film adaptation is pretty bad. I get the feeling that the director must have seen A gameplay video on YouTube and decided to turn it into a movie, thinking, he understands the game main story chronicles .In the movie, there is no background development on why this is happening i.e. the introduction of the travel stones and why they are there?, moving on, the character, to be killed of quickly, are given no life story (even if they are about to go as quickly as they came in), almost as if the director doesn't want to care - and wants to just dive into the Hunter vs Monster mish mash!!I don't get it, how can a Rathalos take out a whole US army? In the GAME he can be hurt by, well... almost anything, there is even a gun type of weapons that you can choose from, and Oh the weak spot isn't when ""it's about to breathe fire"" it's his head, wings and tail - which can be severed ( in the game to craft for materials). Still referencing the game, he is HARD to kill due to his attacks and is one of the toughest wyverns to fight, made me use up quiet a few of my health potions and antidotes - yes - he has poisonous claws. (From Me to You = info for a non-gamer/ reader).In the movie, the hunters are scared, like tall frightened bunnies with no feels or expression to say they have ever been on a monster hunt - let along being called one!! I saw them as a bunch of trainees, untrained, (with cool outfits), unwilling to do a job they cannot do anyways ..... so will end up being burned alive.My thoughts for the director - Action should have not been in cuts, fights should have been developed with major monsters e.g. injuring a monster then chasing it down, then ending it with an epic scene, instead of doing, few romantic hit and miss scenes then 1-hit-KO = Dead Rathalos! Also character development, e.g. who are they? Why are they here?, GET an understanding to MHW (Monster Hunter World) either keep story inside the MH world or if you want to try something new, then ask the fans, and FINALLY, and probably the most important one, HIRE SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY PLAYS THIS GAME!!Overall - I enjoyed the movie, it's great if you like monsters flicks.",Monster Hunter
759,ralphhelm-69745,Because it's fiction doesn't mean it has to be totally unrealistic,4,16 February 2021,"There was plenty of CGI, plenty of monsters, plenty of action ... and that was the most believable part of the movie.I know, I know, we live in the era where gender is everything. But having worked with real Rangers in sh**ho**s around the planet, there is no way ANY of these movie soldiers would even pass a normal infantry bootcamp .... not to mention ranger school. Until now - and only because of gender again - only three ranger tabs where given out to female candidates. Women call this a success, soldiers call this a ""quota"" or ""politics"". So no, Multipass is not a credible ranger ... or even a soldier to start with. And no, her physical condition is not at fault, but her looks and demeanor. If not The Rock should have been an elite soldier in Doom, too, but even with his physique he totally failed. And if anyone has the misfortune to have had a roll-over car accident or got punched in the mouth knows that whatever they show in this movie is physically (like in physical science) and medically (as in how the human body works) IM-POSSIBLE. How do you make Fantasy believable? If you add it to reality. Take away reality, then your Fantasy becomes unbelievable. Even magic in movies works often with rituals, formulas and follows physics of fire, ice, electricity, gravity etc. Here we are at Chris-Pratt-talks-with-dinosaurs fantasy level.And don't even get me started with the plot holes, unnecessary fight scenes for the sake of showing action for no reason. Someone wrote he/she loved the film because it's so close to the source material .... well, we obviously have not played the same games. Costumes an weapons looked correct (and like beginner equipment) and even some monsters were included. But that's it.
Paul W. S. Anderson has quite a few very good films under his belt: Event Horizon, Soldier, the first Resident Evil and why not the practical-fx action movie Death Race.

The scene when Artemis (Milla Jovovich) finds the key, rolls it in her fingers, and then kisses it, reminds one of the infamous Ring of Power in the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit Trilogies. The Diablos are very similar to Diablo, the eponymous game from Blizzard, while Rathalos is featured in diverse video games and films. The ship that sails in sand has yet another likeness to the Si Wong people who travel the sand using sand-sailers featured in the Avatar franchise. Ron Perlman (as the Admiral) has a small part to play in the movie and a hair style that reminds the viewer of the 1987 Beauty and the Beast.

771,Rithrius,Let a fan make the movie next time!,2,8 July 2021,"You can summarize what's wrong with this movie in one word: Tone.Monster Hunter is first and foremost a colorful and joyful game. In the game's overall story, massive communities of hunters all over the world thrive on the monster hunting profession. When they go on a hunt, they live for the excitement it gives them. They'd gladly rush a monster head-on because that's just what their culture is all about. When it comes down to it, Monster Hunter is supposed to be a somewhat light-hearted but exciting joyride.The movie treats it like it's a dead world with people struggling to survive, dying left and right, depressed and on edge. Almost as if it's some kind of apocalyptic future. How can you call it a Monster Hunter movie if you can't even get the tone right? It's the most important ingredient of any movie adaptation. It is very obvious that Paul W. S. Anderson had no idea what he was making a movie about.Out of all the things that bothered me, that's probably what ties all of its problems together. It was written, directed, and performed like it was just another Resident Evil movie.",Monster Hunter

The directing leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the opening scenes. The producers seems to have been inspired by a lot of classic scenes, taken directly from Bruckheimer, Michael Bay, and the lot, and there are some major influences from other Blockbusters as well.That being said, it´s not a terrible movie.If you´re at home, you´re a bit hungover, and it´s breakfast time, this is an excellent, braindead, visually stunning movie to watch if you can find it at your prefered streaming service.Maybe not cinema material, unless you´re in for an IMAX ride just for the sake of the special effects, but it´s definitely worth a watch.

Paul WS Anderson does not know how to direct good action, he just crams in as many cuts and different camera angles as possible which makes it a chore to follow what's happening rather then just enjoying it.

you know at last what reason for what happen at the movie start but it needed more characters for the fight.
it got brilliant ideas when fighting but I think the last one in dragon monster was similar to the ending in movie hot to train your dragon 1.
no many events in the movie but the sub scenes is some how long and stressing and be on nerves.
the cooperation between the two heroes took long time to happen.
too many sci fi and graphics at the end.
I recommend if no other good movie from your favorite actor on cinema and definitely it is not a Christmas movie but a week end friend gathering one. I liked the suspense and the thrilling and the cat - very funny cat should have been had more time in the movie - but I hated the too many graphics and the small number of cast.",Monster Hunter

823,drtimelord,Horrible Adaptation,1,21 December 2020,"This movie is horrid as an adaptation of the games. The movie makes the world to be a ""survival of the fittest, no fun allowed"" setting when that's not Monster Hunter. The hunters don't kill to survive, they do it because it's fun and because they need to occasionally. Sure, there is the occasional threat of an elder dragon but it's still light hearted up until the climax. The movie.. is not that. It lacks the charm the games and even books have.Spoilers:
At the end they bring in Gore Magala, one of my favorite monsters from the series. But only as a cliff hanger and no build up. In Monster Hunter 4, he's the main antagonist with what feels like a rivalry with the player. But in this, there's no build up, no fun, and no mention of the Frenzy Virus, GORE'S STAPLE. This film lacks humor, charm, and tries to tell a story that's Monster Hunter only in name.",Monster Hunter

A really dissapointing thing was the scenes that were cut like every 2 or 4 seconds. Even when they faught the monsters, it wasn't even a long scene that would make the fight more dramatic.

All we got was a badly made stretched out episode of a tv show. This film would have been an incredible tv show as a format. The film ends at a big cliffhanger and it doesnt even resolve the plot to begin with. The acting was horrendous, the pacing too. The first half of the movie could have ended in about 20 minutes instead it stretches for about an hour and 10 minutes. Such a shame. I say kill the sequel and turn it into a tv show.

It reminded me of the last Resident Evil movie with how many cuts there were in the action scenes, which Mila Jovovich also starred in. I don't see how they didn't learn their lesson from that. Within a 10 second period there are 8 to 10 cuts which make the action scenes hard to watch, and most importantly enjoy. With this being an action film I can't recommend spending money to watch since the action scenes are ruined by the amount of mind numbing cuts in them.",Monster Hunter
849,lxvanxschaik,"Well, it's not good...",5,9 December 2020,"I knew what I was in for watching the trailer. It's schlocky, has a paper-thin plot and mediocre acting at best. Going into it with these expectations, I can honestly say I had a good time?Yes, it's a terrible video game movie. You can't convince me anyone asked for this. Yes, Paul W. Anderson makes this to show off how pretty his wife is (I don't super blame him, Milla Jovovich is hella fit). Yes, I can imagine how people who like the game are going to be upset.Personally, I'm not super attached to the franchise. I'm also a fan of hating on terrible action movies like this. So yes, I had a good time. Don't pay to go see it in theatres, wait for it to wind up on a streaming platform or get it on Blu-Ray or something. It's /fine/ for a dumb movie with explosives.NOW. Spoiler territory:This movie feels like someone had three different movie ideas they kind of try to fit together. It starts as kind of a horror movie with the military, where all of them are picked off by the Diablos (big angry sand swimming horn monster) and Nerscylla (Scorpion/spider pricks that will haunt my nightmares), with some hints of body horror (said scorpion/spider pricks laying eggs inside people). Then it transitions to kind of a buddy cop thing where Artemis and the Hunter get to know each other and ""bond"", and finally it becomes kind of a fantasy adventure when Ron Perlman swoops in. It's disjointed, but at least it keeps going. It didn't feel like it dragged... for the most part.I did not care for the fact they kept going back to the Nerscylla. Not only because I am very jumpy and every second with them on screen is spending time in jumpscare-central, mind you. At some point it felt very drawn out and kind of annoying to have to keep coming back to it. I get it. They're terrible gross monsters and we hate them and they're gross. Could we not instead have spent more time hunting other monsters?Downside number 2: there's only like... three monsters. Diablos, Nerscylla, and Rathalos. Now, I'm not super into Monster Hunter, but when I went into this I expected more monster hunting. It didn't really feel like that at all. The fights we get are nice and action packed, sure. I'm also of the opinion the monsters all look pretty good. No complaints on the CGI here. I just... kind of felt disappointed there wasn't more of them, and that we instead spent so much time with the Nerscylla.I don't want to spend too much time on the controversy. I'm sorry this was offensive to many, and I understand what was insensitive about it. I'm also sorry for the people who made the games for getting bashed for this though? Bash the movie, please! It's not very good and if you feel triggered or upset by it for whatever reason, voice that opinion! I just don't understand why an unrelated piece of media also needs to suffer just because it shares a name.Anyway, that's my two cents. It's a dumb movie; if you're aware of that going in, you'll be fine.",Monster Hunter

851,jasontopshot,Bad movie all around,3,11 December 2020,"This is a niche movie that fails to appeal to the mainstream audience and monster hunter players alike. The story would still be just as good/bad if random scenes in the movie were swapped around. There lacked any continuity and impact between basically anything. Cgi and monsters were decent, but that's probably about it. For hardcore monster hunter fans the weapons and combat were god awful as if they maybe watched a trailer for the game at most without really understanding what the combat is like. There were multiple attacks that straight up don't exist in the games but would have been very simple to substitute with ones that did, it just felt lazy. Overall no redeeming qualities other than well animated monsters, but even then there weren't very many. Also one of the monsters in the trailer showed up for like 5 seconds and they were clearly just baiting us but too lazy to give it a proper scene. Casting was decent except for the admiral, he wasn't very admiral like. Unfortunately a lot of the cast didn't get much screen time at all.The two short quests added to the game as promo for this movie had a better story in its few minutes than this entire movie did in a couple hours. My expectations were extremely low but somehow were still not even close to met.",Monster Hunter
852,semvb,Damn!,10,12 December 2020,This movie was far more than i have ever expected! CGI was fantastic!! Monsters looked really good and the actors where really good.

But I watched this in 4D and im still in shock of how good it was! This is a must see for CGI fans!,Monster Hunter
853,tonnyf-52852,Captures the essence of the video game,9,28 February 2021,"As the title says, this movie isn't about some convoluted or well-thought plot.Instead, what it does have is this:1 - Diablo and Rathalos, presented accurately, with their powers, animations, sounds, movements and even environments.2 - Accurate weapon styles, just like in the game - although to be fair, they could have given a bit more screen time to the Switch Axe3 - Accurate costumes, actors looking similar to their in-game counterparts4 - Monster fights that are true to the game, down to Diablo walking a little bit sideways just before you pump him with some tranq shots and Rathalos letting out a little smoke to signal that he is exhausted.As someone that just saw ""Bleach - the movie"" and was appalled at how little they cared about Inoue, Rukia, and the general idea of the characters - except Ichigo, this movie adaptation of a videogame is a solid 9/10, and is exactly what I was hoping for.If you never played the game, but enjoy the movie, I sincerely recommend getting Monster Hunter: World, and you will find similar action scenes, only this time you will be the one in the main character shoes, and it makes it even more enjoyable. Also, as an inside joke, normally you can and should solo a Rathalos, but Mila and Tony were probably under-geared and had low-tier weapons. :DThank you for a great movie that I really enjoyed for what it is, a solid and respectful adaptation of one of my most beloved videogames.",Monster Hunter
854,thaddbanks,"""Most faithful video game adaptation"" Yeah right try worst video game adaptation",1,15 December 2020,"So this is actually the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen, and the worst part to me is there are still monster hunter fans legitimately defending it.So first off you never really even get a good look at the monster cause the editing is so jumpy and erratic and even when a shot lingers it's super zoomed in so you can't see the monster., so even people who are just going to see the monsters are gonna be disappointed.Second all the weapons are way to small except for maybe the bugstaff like the admiral has a switch axe and it's like the same height as him. Also he keeps doing this move with switchaxe that looks like the elemental discharge for charge blade where he slams the ground and a huge shockwave goes out.
And every weapon just has the inexplicable ability to light itself on fire for no reason.Third every monster save for rathalos is essentially killed in one blow and even rathalos kinda. No cool fight choreography with the hunter dodging around the monster nothingthe proportions for monster are everywhere like we knew the main monsters were gonna be too big but they couldn't even get the scale on small monsters like cephalos right.Fourth they kill rathalos in the most generic kill a dragon way possible. You know that thing where dragons like have gas in there bodies so someone can just through like a firecracker in its mouth and the dragon explodes which is exactly what Artemis does.Miia jovovich's character is the biggest Mary Sue I've ever seen. I swear to god she trains for 1 maybe 2 days and ends up kicking way more monster butt than any of the actual hunter characters in the movie. None of the monster hunter universe characters really add anything to the ""story"" they are literally just there to pad runtime they could not be their and the movie would be essentially the same. Tony jaa just speaks jibberish the whole time and occasionally has a martial arts duel with Artemis so she can look cool. The handler does literally nothing, and the admiral just shows up punches Artemis in the face and takes em to the tower. The meowscular chef is also in the movie for like maybe 30 secs. There's no other palicoes either so enjoy him while he's there.And finally and this tics me off to no end gore magala is barely and I mean BARELY in the movie at the very end for one final scene where Artemis, Tony jaa, and the admiral all charge at it and the movie just cuts to the credits.Like wow it's one thing for a trailer to be misleading but the trailers for this movie were intentionally manipulative, and made to try and bait people into seeing this with false promises.Please for the love of god don't waste your money I sure glad I didn't.",Monster Hunter

Its literally nothing like the games its literally an entire movie about highlining the actors cast in the movie. Absolutely nothing about the games or the lore from the games its 100% about the Hollywood talent here they have done 0 to bring new audiences to the series this movie would mislead people more than anything and that's exactly what we all feared.The main protagonist is shoved down our throat and we have no idea who the person is she has nothing to do with the games at all like zero why is she so forcefed to us like go away i have no interest in you just give me well crafted monsters and memorable fights. This movie does nothing to appease the fans of the game. Its only to appease Hollywood shills and feminists.I cant give this movie a realistic score as i am a fan of the series and this should not be called monster hunter. Its not a monster hunter movie. Its just not. Id give it 0/10 if i could because its called monster hunter but it has literally nothing to do with the series. Avoid it at all costs if you are a fan.,Monster Hunter

Waiting for the sequel",Monster Hunter

878,kamkamsabahi,"Not so bad, not so great.",6,20 January 2021,"If you come from playing the Monster Hunter games, such as I did. I was super excited to see an adaptation from the games and see my favourite monsters on the big screen.Unfortunately, this movie didn't reference much from the games, really on just Rathalos and Diablos that are from the game are shown in the movie.They spent way too much time in the desert scene and not enough on backstory, they spent wasted so much time showing off how big their CGI budget is and not enough on lore.If you like screaming, monsters, and non stop violence, I'd recommend this movie for you.
If you came from the games, this just isn't it, so many cut scenes and they included some random dragon in the end that didn't look like anything from the series. (I was really hoping for Nergigante)CGI - 10
Characters and Story - 4
Relevance to the game - 2
Entertainment - 6(But seriously where is Anjanath)",Monster Hunter
879,timdavies-60534,I'm surprised how many people actually like this movie,2,21 January 2021,"I have been playing games in the monster hunter franchise for almost a decade now and as soon as I heard about this movie I knew it was gonna suck. Video game movies typically are horrible, but I thought as long as they nailed a few things I'd be fine with it.
To start the monster CGI is surprisingly good for this low budget film. Diablos, Rathalos, and even Gore Magala looked good on screen. But my issue is with the lack of diversity. I understand that most of the budget went into the few monsters we got, but we only saw 4 large monsters and none of them interacted with each other at all. In fact the main characters had to kill Nerscylla (giant spider) at one point to use it's venom to paralyze Diablos. Don't get me wrong this is a part that I would say worked well, but they could've set up an awesome scene with a Nerscylla fighting Diablos and paralyzing him that way.
Also, that is the ONLY scene where the hunters are strategizing to take down a monster. In a movie titled monster hunter I want more monsters hunted. The fight against Rathalos has zero strategy or thought put into it and it culminates to ""kill bad dragon"". They give Rathalos a weak spot in this movie which I'm fine with because the monsters in the games all have parts of there body that are weak, but they made it INVINCIBLE unless you use it. Literally this thing wouldn't die. I only have a problem with this because Rathalos from the games is a mid tier monster at best in terms of difficulty.
Also the fact that the male hunter can't speak English is annoying and while it leads to some funny moments ends up making the film longer than it needs to be. Also the scene of the main characters fighting made no sense to me either, the movie is called ""monster hunter"" not John Wick.
Most of the character design was ripped straight from the most recent game ""monster hunter world"" and it's stupid. They look dumb and simplifying the design would have been for the best. It's funny how they're willing to add things like dimension hopping and modern military to monster hunter, but don't take a risk in changing the designs of characters that look dumb as hell in live-action.
Obviously, there is no story to speak of here which makes me mad that there weren't more monsters to enjoy, as a long time fan of the franchise I am deeply disappointed in this film.
Please don't see this movie if you're a monster hunter fan and play the games, if you know nothing about monster hunter maybe watch this for free at some point in the future if you get a chance.",Monster Hunter
880,stephenmrjones,Terrible,2,17 March 2021,"They used monster hunter as the title to get more clout, nice cgi and good cast, but milla was invincible again like every other film her husband directs. not worth your time unless you never heard of the monster hunter game franchise and enjoy mindless action",Monster Hunter

This felt like a poorly made thesis film that only focused on the monster fights.

Great scenes from the game, the fights filled the screen, one right after the next. Theres no romantic subplot as this is just pure, raw military action. Unfortunatly theres the infinite magazine that comes from hollywood misunderstanding firearms, and several incogruities with modern tech, but other than that this was a well built monster hunter movie.",Monster Hunter

898,dxw-38392,an OK popcorn movie if you just want to kill some time,3,21 February 2021,"Any of the monster hunter fan would agree with me, this is just another typical Hollywood film formula where a man and a woman deserted out of nowhere, starting a bond, trying to survive, typical hollywood stuff, but thats not how monster hunter universe works, its about challenging bigger and more powerful monsters, upgrading your equipment, killing monsters so the local ecosystem dont get overrun by big monsters and destroy the food chain, they didnt even catch the spirit of monster hunter, i doubt the directors and writers ever played monster hunter before, how are you gonna make a good movie thats adopting a video game if you never played it, it makes me so mad as a monster hunter fan, also, the constant cut actually gave me discomfort, im not sensitive to light or anything, but the beginning where they fall off a cliff in sandstorm almost give me nausea, overall, its an ok film if you never played monster hunter before, just another typical hollywood film, no plot, no depth, a pure popcorn movie, with some great cgi, the only reason i give it 3 star instead of one is how well their cgi are made, altho the ratio of how large monsters are compare to human is little off, feels like its 10 times bigger than in game, so yeah, not recommended",Monster Hunter

Hunters in the game are civilized and don't go like ""CHOCOLATE"" and ""MMMMMM"" also if they are going to have favorite monsters why did they add the handler? She is so hated and the entire movie I was hoping she died. (No affence to the actor) and they could have added so many more favorite monsters like kulu-ya-ku and barioth. Also I have loved the game for their cat people the Palicos. But what the heck was that thing the called the palico it looked like rocket the racoon went on steroids and killed the entire MCU and what was with the acting like ""omg almost the entire squad was killed and we almost died I am terrified what do we do?!?!?"" Then the main character went "" you are a soldier"" then it was like ""ok"" and that is it. One last thing... they could have added the music from the game like I thought I was watching the movie then it turns into tron like what is with the cyber music?

That said, Its a Fun Popcorn Flick with some alright Special effects and some Toe Curling Imagery. The story gives you no context however and it gets right into the Action which feels somewhat Souless at times. It really does feel like for for first 50 Minutes of the film nothing that matters happens. Some of the Acting leaves a bit to be desired at times but TI and Milla Jovovich are certainly the highlights there. Ultimately there is some accuracy in the Lore and It does have some Monster Hunter Feel to it and All of the monsters are well designed and true to their form. The final battle was quite a twist I can say I didn't see coming and it leaves the door open for a sequel which...if we're being honest we will probably never see.

The Monster Hunter games are a joy because they bring quite a bit of silliness along with their crazy monster fights but this is just so focused on violence.Wheres Poogie??? The most important character in any Monster Hunter game! Why are some of the characters speaking english and others aren't? Why would you put that godawful hair on Ron Perlman? Why would you pick Ron Perlman for this role anyway? He looks so out of place here.The story is weak, we could have been fighting monsters instead of spending 15 minutes waiting for Mila to tell Tony that she wasn't his enemy.... especially right after he rescues her.... this is monster hunter not mortal kombat. And why does Ron Perlman punch her in the face and imprison her? whats the point of that?I did appreciate the chef and his cooking scene, this was the most true to the game part of the movie and best part. I was glad to see the handler at least show up, but wish she had an actual role in the story.Overall, it was still fun to watch, but they could have made it so much better if they had focused more on the silly, fun, friendly side of monster hunter, and less on the violent, dark and unfriendly part that we see here.

935,abyssalshadows,What do you expect from a Paul Anderson movie?,3,22 April 2021,"Paul Anderson to me is easily the new age Michael Bay. No real good acting, horrible script, nonexistent plot, but a lot of mindless explosions and decent CGI. I have been a Monster Hunter fan for OVER 15 YEARS at this point. Playing since 2nd Gen and sometimes buying consoles entirely so I can try the new gen games as they are released worldwide, but this movie is complete and utter garbage. As soon as I saw that Milla Jovovich was being starred as a main actress I was already in my head going ""God either this movie is going to do decently or flop so hard that it turns people away from Monster Hunter forever"". I digress, As I approached the seats of the theatre to a bunch of other nervous nerds like me with my friends, we were greeted by the most epic opening and I was getting excited because it actually looked like Monster Hunter's world... but then the charm ended when it went to the most cliche plot to a movie you could possibly make. Like really? Why are we making a movie based on a series with tons of hours worth of lore and hidden story with an Alice in Wonderland meets Call of Duty like experience? Capcom has around 20+ hours worth of interesting lore going from the Great Dragon War, to the new stories of the New World in Monster Hunter World, and the best this idiot director could do is put the American Military inside of a rabbit hole to the Monster Hunter universe? Come on man. Let's just be reasonable here. But, alas it gets worse. I knew this director couldn't resist making wet dream shots of his wife. Like, I don't care about all that, I just want to see some live action monster hunting... Where is the Hunting Horn? Where are the Long Swords? Where are the Light and Heavy Bowguns? Why is Ron Perlman using a Switch Axe and somehow creating fire by slamming it on the ground? Heck, he never even switched the switch axe from axe mode to sword mode. When Tony Jaa gets the Insect Glaive (or I assume that's what it was at the end considering that's the only weapon I know that allows you to helicopter around in), where's the Kinsect? There are also weird weapons that I never even seen before, like the broken sword Tony Jaa was using after the fight with Diablos, and the one that Ron Perlman gives to Milla Jovovich at the end. She'd have been much better off with the Light Bowgun and abusing the rapid fire.Throughout the movie there are so many plot holes that you could play connect the dots and make a 3D outline of the Rathalos. But it doesn't stop there... it doesn't even follow the actual lore of Monster Hunter's Universe. The ancient civilization DID exist, however, they didn't make some portal to another world. They died off from Fatalis, the god of Elder Dragons, which is why the ruins of Castle Schrade exist, and where it's unironically where you face off against Fatalis in most of the games he's featured in. The Ancients used to enslave the Wyverns, which is what created the hatred of Fatalis, who despises the other monsters for being so weak to allow humans to enslave them in order to make an anti-dragon super weapon called the ""Equal Dragon Weapon"". Instead of capitalizing on so much good lore to work with, they create this hot mess. This movie was going in so many directions it's like it didn't know what it wanted to be, from a Boots Hit the Ground military movie, or a Monster Hunting movie, or just a generic action movie. Please Capcom, don't greenlight another movie for this moron. He's clearly never even played the games to understand any of the actual mechanics or the lore behind the games.",Monster Hunter

It's not an Academy Awards contender, nor a movie that will go down history as a classic. Despite that, it's a pretty good experience. I've create my account to give this review because the movie deserves better than its current rating.The plot is kinda generic (or some would say ""thin""), but the monsters, action scenes and fights are really cool. The different nods to the Monster Hunter franchise with references and eater eggs are also really nice. There are no real ""downtime"" as the movie is filled with action.I recommend it. Dont go in expecting a genre defining movie or "" James Cameron's Avatar "", but it's nowhere near as bad as some people would like to make you think. Break the popcorn, sit comfortably and give it a go. I'll most likely check it again in a few years. It's a pretty good experience, even for a Paul W. S. Anderson's movie ;)",Monster Hunter

Have to say, in this one, he's more like the runner-up of a Comic-Con Anime costume contest..

What else do you need? Maybe some popcorn, nachos and a large coke.
This is the equivalent of a Fast n Furious movies for nerds, (you) the movie expert, can b*tch all day about how this kind of movies offer no storyline, no character development nor backstory and just no clear storytelling. But deep down, you know that you enjoyed this movie with all its explosions, and if you haven't watched it, you will enjoy it.Monster Hunter comes down to huge monsters with awesome-ish CGI that rival even those of modern kaiju movies, comparable to Godzilla (2014), Shin Godzilla, Pacific Rim 1&2, it delivers, that's it, it just delivers.Big exciting monster fights and cool characters with cooler scences, and I won't even start with the references to the game, but if you enjoyed the game, you'll love the movie, which, btw, the games don't have backstory nor character development, so, it stuck to the game fairly good.If you want a steak with some salad, a glass of whiskey, then that's fine.

972,kevroberts90,"Low expectations, high enjoyment.",7,26 October 2021,"When I first saw the trailer my initial reaction was an eye roll and a heavy sigh as I thought sarcastically to myself ""Oh great, another video game based movie directed by Paul WS Anderson staring his wife"", a natural reaction after enduring the Resident Evil franchise.I picked this up with the mind set of maybe it'll be so bad that it turns out to be enjoyable in some way. As someone who played the games endlessly back in the day, I was intrigued to see how the monsters would look and if they'd include any of the more bizarre elements.In the games you create your own avatar to play as as you explore the world, so having a character not from the monster world to act as the audience surrogate makes sense, if not a little basic. The film does a decent job of setting up monsters so it doesn't feel like random monster fight after random monster fight, an example would be when first arriving in the monster world we see the remains of a group of soldiers cooked well done, this sets up this movies big threat.The chemistry between Milla Jovovich and Tony Jaa is incredible, a highlight of the film and keeps things interesting in between the action set pieces, it also adds some genuinely good humour. The costumes and props in the film are amazing and taken straight from the games. The idea of harvesting from monsters to create gear to use in hunts does exist but isn't the focus here, thankfully, because grinding for gear in the games was very time consuming and would not make for great on screen entertainment.Not sure how I feel about the ending as we've seen Anderson do this exact ending before in Mortal Kombat (1995). I didn't need the sequel bait to leave me wanting more as I was fully onboard by the time the 3rd act began.Monster Hunter is not a classic, however, I do see it becoming a cult classic in years to come. Easy to watch at the expense of a lot of the lore of games but not entirely overlooked. It hits all the expected marks for a fantasy film and has some charm of its own. I went in with low expectations and came out with confusion over the hate this film gets. If you're on the fence, give it a chance, like myself, you maybe pleasantly surprised.",Monster Hunter

983,Liev2W,"An average blockbuster, but a must see for Monster hunter fans.",6,4 December 2020,"I'll first start off by saying that I'm a big monster hunter fan. Monster hunter is directed by Paul W.S Anderson and stars Milla Jovovich as the leading role. Comparing this movie to his previous films it's clear that it's actually miles better.(which isn't a hard thing to do considering how bad his previous movies have been) Yes, he still can't hold a shot for more than 2 seconds and overuses shaky cam. But it's a big improvement over his previous movie: Resident Evil: the final chapter.(which I couldn't even finish watching because of the way it was edited) Overall this movie is alright, really it's nothing special. But as a Monster Hunter fan I loved it. This is due to the nature of the games and story, which the game doesn't really have. So it's quite interesting to see how he manages to fill in the story of which is sparsely shown in the monster hunter games. What I loved is the amount of fan service the movie had which I do not want to spoil. From re-creating shots from cutscenes of the games to having a couple of well know things that are in the game, it brought a smile to my face. Now let's discuss the elephant in the room: the US military. I feel like this part of the movie is not even that bad, and it doesn't take long before they get rid of the military aspect of the movie and go full on monster hunter. I did feel like the movie really grazed over any development of any characters which makes them really disposable. The rest of the movie has some alright action scenes with many great visuals. (considering the 60 Million budget) I was really surprised by the visuals and locations. They actually look real and are by far the best part of it. Also the creatures are really accurate to the games and move and sound just like them! My biggest gripe with this movie is the climax, or lack of one. The movie doesn't really feel like it can stand on it's own and is my biggest gripe with it.SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW!So after they defeat Rathalos in the movie, a Gore Magala shows up and they start a big battle.(which is built up as a finale) But then the movie just ends!? I am absolutely mind boggled to why they would make a choice like that. The movie lacks any closure or any final feeling act. I can't imagine that any director would be satisfied with an ending like this.So please go into the movie knowing that the Rathalos fight is the finale and set your expectations to that. Anyway....So if you just want to see some awesome creature designs and some decent fights. this movie is for you!As a normal movie i would rate this a 4/10 But as a monster hunter fan i would rate it a 7/10 Which is why i am rating it a 6/10,because for me it was above average.(And a masterpiece for Paul W.S Anderson standards) Thank you for reading, and Happy Hunting!",Monster Hunter

Then it ends on a cheap sequel hook.It seems like a survival flick for the two main characters, building to a battle with the dreaded Diablos which has been plaguing our heroes from the beginning, then when that's done with half an hour to go they bring in a host of supporting characters and some big epic world-saving mission which doesn't get properly resolved.It's a classic problem with video game movies and cheap action movies, especially the 'two world's collide type'But if you're bored and don't give a damn, it kills a couple of hours.",Monster Hunter

1001,darkbowser-63724,"Bad, even for a genric monster movie",1,24 December 2020,"Short and sweet, this movie was both a disappointment from the perspective of a fan to the Monster Hunter series and from the perspective of a brain-numbing popcorn flick. First off, it's as generic as you can get in any monster of sci-fi movie, except every sound effect and film shoot felt cheaper than usual. Aside from the CGI of the monsters, the movie looked almost stop-motion in how it constantly switched between shots and panned out between every scene. The effects with the lights were seizure inducing while every punch surprisingly had the generic bone crunching sound bite added to it. Unfortunately the backdrops and costumes looked poor and were shot in a sandbox for 90% of the movie, which was specially sad since the series is known for it's colorful and interesting armour/weapon designs. From a fan's perspective the intro was surprise culture shock to players and promised a different movie until it cut to the title scene and replaced with army soldiers. From that point on it was as by-the-book as you could get. (SPOILERS FURTHER ON) All the unique culture and world building from the games were ignored as the focus was put onto the director's wife surviving with a Hunter who is treated like a savage and insulted with blatant advertisement from Hersey's in a scene that uses the classic ""foreigner eats American food"" trope. All but one soldier is slaughtered in the first 20 minutes and any other characters from the ""game world"" aren't introduced until the last 20 minutes with no development. Only 3 momsters make their debut with some classic fauna shown in a few second scene later. The ending trashes the lore of a popular flagship monster Gore Magula and used as an obvious setup that begs film studios for a sequel. At the end of it, it was sad seeing another Capcom IP be poorly adapted and represented at its one shot in Hollywood. The film was so poor one can't even enjoy it as a summer monster movie without seeing through its paper-thin production quality sadly. There are better monster movies out there to watch.",Monster Hunter
1002,ruthanne-37022,If you know the game you'll enjoy,9,26 January 2021,My whole family plays monster hunter and we thoroughly enjoyed the movie. We hope it is the first of more and that people that don't understand the game and gave low ratings don't stop it from happening.,Monster Hunter
1003,moosewhisperer-99195,Military adviser,4,4 April 2021,"Hire a military adviser next time. If you had one for this film, never hire him/her again. To many errors to list here.",Monster Hunter
1004,jay-43002,This is the definition of Hollywood .,1,6 March 2021,"First off I've never reviewed a movie, but I am so disappointed with this movie that I had do say something somewhere. I'm about half way through as we speak, if you're a fan of the video game.... do not watch it. I don't know what they were thinking. Mila jovovich for one does not belong in this movie, all they did was add a diablos and slap the name monster hunter on it. The first 60 seconds of the movie so far has been the only thing that felt like monster hunter. I'm not even sure I can finish it tbh. It's a shame that such a creative and awesome video game was turned into a typical Hollywood movie.Tony Jaa is awesome and makes a cool hunter though.",Monster Hunter
1005,ladyfish-15725,The hell did I just watch?,4,19 April 2021,"Listen, I looooove monster movies. And this one does not disappoint in the monster playing field. But I was genuinely left saying ""wait, what?""That being said, a young boy would absolutely be thrilled with this movie.",Monster Hunter
1006,nova-29056,Resident evil look a like,4,13 April 2021,So disappointed it was like watching resident evil great actress but wrong lead I was hoping it would be like the game but instead it wasn't it would of been better as a tv series rather than a movie less than 2 hours not enough time to create a good story for a franchise like this.,Monster Hunter
1007,sodoshitanaka,"Not great, but not terrible",5,18 February 2021,"This is a middle-of-the-road fantasy adventure, with some pretty average CGI and wooden acting. Not the worst thing I've seen, and rates about the same as the Dungeons and Dragons movie or Eragon. The wire-fu was poor (Every time Ron turned up, for instance) but Tony Jaa was fun to watch when fighting, but his acting was... not great. And poor Mila, at least she tried. Watch Tremors to get a better 'burrowing monster' movie.",Monster Hunter
1008,thomkhall,Wow. Just wow.,3,31 December 2020,"Movie had monsters and people killed them before the monsters killed them first. Except the ones that got killed first. Nice dragons. Also, space. Yeah humanity. Movies are so good with popcorn and beverage.",Monster Hunter
1009,jeanstout,Best vfx movie ever...,10,5 January 2021,"Every monster and alien movies are silly and created under low budget. But this... omg. I salute you Paul Anderson 👍 love all your movies, death race, resident evil sequel etc. The best GCI / VFX. Great good. Worth buying the ticket 🎟",Monster Hunter
1010,marsdenj-05532,An Insult.,1,5 August 2021,Way too much slow motion.Plot? Literally none.The thickest level of plot armour I have ever seen.As a fan of fan of the games this is an insult and frankly a spit in the face.,Monster Hunter
1011,jackieb-26149,Had so much potential but didn't make it.,4,19 December 2020,"As a monster hunter fan I'm disappointed but not surprised.
The movie started out ok but killing off the squad so quickly and then dragging on for almost a good hour before getting to rathalos. Basically 3 monsters one that I didn't recognize but you also have diablos and 'greater' rathalos. Of course you have gore magala but they only show them for a good 30's that's it. The action in the movie seemed very short. Not great writing, acting wasn't all to good either.
If you plan on going to see it just wait till it's on dvd to be honest or on a 3rd party website it's not worth your money.",Monster Hunter
1012,o-zyosborne,Fun movie let down by the edit,7,7 January 2021,"The movie was entertaining. For what it was it was written well enough and I enjoyed the acting and soundtrack (great game feel. Loved the soundtrack)
It had way to many cuts per action scene making things hard to follow and let's down the actors performance.
If recut the movie allowing breaths in the action and this movie would be a much much better film. All in all. If you want an action monster killing movie. Go watch it.
Just know the editing sucked",Monster Hunter
1013,jaironalava,The visual fx are the best,9,1 March 2021,"Poor history, Little funny, entertained, and very impresionist visual fx.... I recommend this movie",Monster Hunter
1014,mikanuutinen-56636,Could be the worst movie I've ever seen,1,21 February 2021,"No story, all the characters get killed off within the first 15 mins. No dialogue, awful fight scenes and no reason to keep watching. I forced myself through the entire movie and I'm writing this review to hopefully stop anyone else from doing the same thing.",Monster Hunter
1015,fernc-31416,Acting still exist ?,1,12 April 2021,Just TI in this film makes it a no no... worst acting ive seen by bunch of adults acting like teens..,Monster Hunter
1016,faight-24557,what kind of knees are these?,1,7 December 2020,"It is very hilarious for the director to choose a naive joke to entertain the public. Though the film is not that bad, but some metaphor is horrifying.The US soldier give the poor native asian-faces some chocolate as gift, this may insinuate that US soldier gave chocalate to Japanese after WWII, considering the MH is a Japanese game in the beginnning.Else, the 'kness' joke has a double satire, Chinese people and George Floyd. What a silly talented screenwriter....-what kind of knees are these?
-I can't brea...theeee...",Monster Hunter
1017,braummkni,Very bad,1,1 March 2021,The actress is very bad. Should replace with male actor,Monster Hunter
1018,yurihyuga-62682,Don't waste your money,1,29 December 2020,Original game more betterSame like Resident evil movie 👎👎👎👎👎,Monster Hunter
1019,pups-32370,Cool Monster's,7,14 March 2021,"It starts out slow, picks up a bit, goes slow again then heads up only to stall. The monster's in this movie are very well done and Milla always provides the action. Just a shame Perlman has to ruin it. The man can't act! His character looks utterly stupid! An from this point on it feels very rushed to get to the end. It's an obvious set up for a sequel to which I hope they put a tad more effort into it an take it from an ok movie to a great movie.",Monster Hunter
1020,vtjw,Great!,10,17 April 2021,Great fantasy! I like it!. Anderson does it again.,Monster Hunter
1021,aamrgomez,Loved it!,8,18 February 2021,Great fun and special effects were top notch as well. Hope there will be a sequel!,Monster Hunter
1022,donbag,Bland with good special effects,4,29 August 2021,"Story doesn't pull you in at all, only the special effects draw your attention away from your mobile phone which you will inevitably be browsing as the movie becomes background noise.",Monster Hunter
1023,nightowlron-90183,Excellent actions. Highly engaging fights,9,11 January 2021,Well not everyone needs a mind-challenging movie. This is for people who seek for pure enjoyment after a working week,Monster Hunter
