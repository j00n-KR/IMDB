0,SnoopyStyle,magnetic debut for Eva Green,6,2 September 2015,It's 1968. Matthew (Michael Pitt) is an American student in Paris to study French. He ends up spending his free time watching French cinema. He meets twins Théo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green) at the Cinémathèque Française protesting the firing of Henri Langlois by the government. Matthew stays with them while their parents are away. They spend all their time together and then the student riots begin.This was the first thing I saw from Eva Green and she is completely magnetic. She owns the screen. She even exceeded the veteran at the time Michael Pitt. It's a big debut. The mixing with the old film clips would have been great except I recognize only a few of them. This meanders too much for me. It's lazy hazy summer of love.,The Dreamers
1,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Movies of the Year,10,19 July 2005,"In 1968, while living in Paris for learning French, the nineteen years old American Matthew (Michael Pitt) meets the also film lovers, amoral and incestuous twins Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) in the ""Cinémathèque Française"" in the Palais de Chaillot and they become best friends. They stay together in the twin's apartment, while many social protests are arising on the streets of Paris.""The Dreamers"" has been released on DVD in Brazil a couple of months ago, and it certainly is one of the best movies of the year. The story conflicts the dreams of three youngsters, who breathe and see the world through the cinema, and the reality of life, on the social movements on streets of Paris. The stone through the window of their apartment is a metaphor of the awakening of Isabelle and Theo. The direction is superb, the cinematography and camera are amazing, the erotic story having the background of true events is delightful and the performance of the cast is perfect. The beauty of the unknown Eva Green is very impressive, and I really recommend this outstanding movie. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Os Sonhadores"" (""The Dreamers"")",The Dreamers
2,Tweekums,Two hours in the company of people who weren't that interesting,6,18 June 2012,"In the summer of 1968 American student Matthew is in Paris; he is spending a year there to improve his French; he is also a cinephile, spending much of his time at the Cinémathèque Française watching films old and new. Also attending are twins Isabelle and Theo although they don't talk to each other until the man in charge of the cinema is fired leading to protests by his supporters. During the protest Matthew gets talking to Isabelle and later gets invited home for dinner. It is raining so he ends up spending the night in the spare room. The next day Isabelle and Theo's parents depart for a month long holiday and the twins invite him to stay. It is clear that Isabelle and Theo aren't like most twins; they have a relationship that is almost incestuous. They spend their time discussing films, enacting scenes from films for the others to guess and when they can't expecting them to perform forfeits of a sexual nature. It is one such forfeit that begins Isabelle and Matthew's sexual relationship. While this is going on the city is in turmoil but the trio barely notice as they are so wrapped up in their own world.What you think of this film will largely be down to what you think of the three main characters; if you find them interesting people to be with you'll probably love it; if you find the to be pretentious bores you won't; unfortunately I found my self leaning towards the latter camp. I suspect it would also help if you have a good knowledge of the films they reference. This isn't to say the film isn't well made; I liked how their actions were intercut with clips from the films they were referencing and thought the actors did a fine job portraying their characters. There is a fair amount of nudity and sexual activity that some viewers might find excessive although it is for the most part dealt with in a very matter of fact way; filmed in the way one might film a clothed person rather than being coy or attempting to eroticise the nudity... there is one scene that might shock though when it becomes clear that is was Isabelle's first time. Overall I'd say this is worth checking out but be prepared to be disappointed... however you might just have the opposite reaction and love it!",The Dreamers
3,moonspinner55,"Let's Face the Music and Dance...a great deal of dancing, but not much facing the music",2,24 July 2011,"An American student, studying French abroad in 1968, attends the Cinematheque festival in Paris and becomes involved with incestuous brother and sister twins--both of whom profess to know a great deal about film, yet spent far more time dallying together in the nude. Screenwriter Gilbert Adair, adapting his novel ""The Holy Innocents"", seems to have concocted a sexually-twisted variation on ""Jules and Jim"", though the banal end results aren't even that inspired, really. Director Bernardo Bertolucci attempts a (winking) correlation between cinema and ""real life"", but a juxtaposition of the two might have been the more thoughtful approach (especially since reality to these children represents nothing more than facile desires). When did Bertolucci go from exploring the sexual psyches of grown-ups to the bare-bottom romps of petulant, wet-lipped, masturbatory teenagers? In the central role, young Michael Pitt cannot escape his physical resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio, and his weakly-agitated performance destroys whatever illusions Bertolucci may have had in creating a sedative amalgam of politics, sex, and the movies. Fabio Cianchetti's cinematography is beautiful, though even he can't disguise the ciphers at the center. *1/2 from ****",The Dreamers
4,Quinoa1984,"the first beauty of a film I've seen in 2004- it brings back memories of 'Last Tango', and of the joys in great cinema in general",10,13 February 2004,"(Possible spoilers ahead)Bernardo Bertolucci's latest work, The Dreamers, displays his brilliant knack at creating an enticing character study (and, like Last Tango in Paris, an underlying theme is that of American ideals vs. Parisian) and with the mis en scene skills of an artist not losing his touch. He tells the story- or less a story than an observation- of a young American named Matthew (Michael Pitt, proving he can pull off a lead performance), who is off in Paris to study, but is head over heels for cinema. He meets twins Theo and Isabelle (Louis Garrel and Eva Green), with free-spirited personalities who are also rabid cine-philes. Matthew is invited to stay in their house, where they live with their parents, and while they are off on vacation, the three get to know one another more, both with movies and with sex.The sex which is in the film is considerably more graphic than other films out now in theaters, but it's no more or less explicit or terrible than that in Last Tango. What's highly of interest is how Bertolucci films scenes involving release through the almighty orgasm- one scene, for example, in which Matthew has a 'forfeit' in a movie question and is to have sex with Isabelle, is handled (without sounding cliché) beautifully. There's a sense of realism in every sense, both in Matthew and Isabelle, and with Theo, who barely seems to mind as he cooks eggs. The end of the scene is a shocker, but not an absurd or offensive one- it'll certainly wake a viewer up, if they aren't already. There's a lot of talk besides the sex, but it is definitely not boring- and it holds minor parallels to modern times (staying indoors and inside the escapist wonderland while there is real danger in the outside).Along with the characters- who are delivered vividly by the three leads (who call back to the French films they mention, like the wonderful Band of Outsiders or Jules and Jim)- there's Bertolucci, who interweaves their situation inside an apartment through most of the film with that of the riots of 1968 in Paris (involving films and/or communism) and with other films, like Breathless, Scarface, and even Top Hat. And, as I mentioned, the camera work is, basically, without a flaw - with Fabio Chianchetti by his side, Bertolucci captures his actors in shots that are psychologically perfected. His sensibilities with the techniques are in the mind-set of a new-wave filmmaker (since, of course, he came out of that era), but since it's a nostalgia piece it gains a higher level. There are a number of ways Bertolucci could've made The Dreamers boring, but none of them happen. Add a soundtrack that pulses with the times (if you like classic rock you'll love it), and it's an impressive feat. And what a fine opening, by the way.",The Dreamers
5,wes-connors,The Naked Truth,6,24 December 2010,"In Paris for the spring of 1968, cute California exchange student Michael Pitt (as Matthew) meets magnetically sexy twins Eva Green and Louis Garrel (as Isabelle and Theo). The young threesome come together via their love for old movies, and mutual attractiveness. Call them sexy cinephiles. When the twins' parents take a month-long holiday, Mr. Pitt is invited to stay over. The trio discuss old movies, as director Bernardo Bertolucci expertly initiates star ""cameos"" with Garbo (as ""Queen Christina"") and Ms. Green memorizing bedrooms. While well-stacked Green puts on a ""Big Brother"" record (an advance copy?), the guys debate Chaplin versus Keaton. Pitt picks Buster, while Mr. Garrel favors Charlie. They run Godard's ""Bande a part"" (1964).The three drink a lot of wine and walk sexily around the house, undressing, while student protesters gather outside Mr. Bertolucci's visually beautiful film misses the mark in a couple of crucial areas. The Parisian place is perfect, but the 1968 appearance isn't; led by Pitt's long-in-the-front modern hairstyle and Green's untimely make-up, the players never really look like they have much to do with the heavily evoked setting. You can't dig it. Only Garrel looks like he could've been there. With supplies so low on bell bottoms, chain belts, and Nehru jackets, ""The Dreamers"" should have used a more modern setting; but, looks aren't everything. Most importantly not too ""groovy"" was the decision to cut writer Gilbert Adair's sexual experimenting between Pitt and Garrel, while leaving in the tease; this is the critical blow, and it hurts the intertwined trio's relationship considerably.****** The Dreamers (9/1/03) Bernardo Bertolucci ~ Michael Pitt, Eva Green, Louis Garrel, Robin Renucci",The Dreamers
6,Boba_Fett1138,Greatly directed and acted.,8,8 January 2007,"I watched this movie without really knowing what to expect. The previews were rather vaguely on what the story was about and what the movie its overall style was. I'll admit that the only reason that made me see this movie were the two actors Michael Pitt and Eva Green, who are two great young new rising stars.What I got to eventually see did not disappointed me. It's a greatly told and intriguing original story about three young film buffs, of which two are twins, in Paris who are drawn toward each other and start to develop an unusual relationship, of which the love for cinema forms the basis. The undertone of the movie is sensual and erotic. Often the images themselves say more than a thousand words. The story is told with mixed old movie classic footage, that the three of them try to impersonate. They breath, eat and think movies. Yes, the movie sounds definitely 'art house' like and it also is an art house movie but its way more accessible than I make it sound.Guess you still have to be a movie lover your self to appreciate the movie and its story and all of its art but then again I don't think that any 'normal' 'regular' movie watchers would decide to watch this movie in the first place. At least I can't think of any reason why. In essence it's a movie about movie lovers for movie lovers.The movie is beautifully directed and it chooses to tell its story really from the view point of the three main characters. It provides us a view in their lifestyle and helps us to understand them, without ever really literally explaining anything. Like I said before, often the images themselves say more than a thousand words. The style of directing gives the actors a lot of room and opportunity to shine. That also happens in this movie, for Michael Pitt, Eva Green, Louis Garrel all deliver a very powerful and heavy performance, plus the three of them work great and very naturally together, especially in the nude sequences.Yes, the movie is filled with lots of explicit nudity from the three main actors and I'm not just talking about a couple of chest shots. So be aware of that before watching this movie, if you know you can't handle it or feel uncomfortable with it. Big kudos to the three main actors for having the guts to appear in the movie that way. You want see anything like this in an Hollywood movie, I can assure you that. But the nudity in the movie also serves a purpose and it's used as a tool to tell the story with and show the bonding and relationship the three of them start to develop over the days.There are times that the movie goes a bit too over-the-top. After all, it remains an independent art house movie. It doesn't make all of the sequences work out as effective or understandable. Some moments make a redundant impression and other moments are not developed well enough, such as the homo-erotic references about the growing relationship between the two male main characters. I think it's a missed opportunity that this wasn't developed any further in the movie. It remains shallow and only features some vague references. It could had provided the movie and its main plot with some intriguing and original sensual layers.Visually the movie is great and it knows how to capture the mood and atmosphere of '60's Paris. The sets are nice and the cinematography effective.It's not really a that relevant or thought provoking movie to watch, so by no means its an essential viewing in my opinion but when you do decide to watch it, you most certainly will not be disappointed. The movie is definitely original and movie buffs will surely know to appreciate it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Dreamers
7,trashgang,some shocking scene's for the easy offended ones,7,13 June 2016,"I came across the name Eva Green a few times in flicks and series. And by doing so I noticed she didn't had any problems with nudity. Due coincidence I came across this flick directed by Bernardo Bertolucci know to make shocking flicks. Anybody can remember Last Tango In Paris (1972). The sex scenes were shocking for the time being.And I must say that Bertolucci is still able to shock the world. Here we have a brother and a sister doing all things together even sleeping together naked but not having sex. When a new student Matthew (Michael Pitt) arrives in Paris they got friends with them and quickly he moves in their house getting involved in the weird world of the brother and sister. For example the brother has to masturbate while the sister is watching, once he came she's wiping his juice off the wall. Weird indeed. But not only that, she has to make love with Matthew while the brother is watching. Being a virgin blood is involved and that can be shocking due the things they do with the blood, or sitting in bath with the two and having her periods. So, shocking scene's indeed.It was Eva Greens her first flick and she goes full frontal for a lot of times even with close-ups of her private parts. Not for everybody due the theme but for lovers of old flicks. The main part is the fact that they are dreamers and are imitating old flicks and those flicks are edited into new shots. So on that part it looks marvelous. Weird flick but what could you expect from this director. Beautiful shots, perfect editing and of course shocking in some parts.Gore 0/5 Nudity 3/5 Effects 0/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",The Dreamers
8,christopher-underwood,Superb and almost faultless film,10,28 March 2006,"Superb and almost faultless film that sweeps you along with it's intelligent script, beautiful cinematography and tremendous soundtrack from the period. Set in Paris in 1968 this is so not about the riots although they provide a counterbalance to on one hand the perceived wisdom of the parental generation and the abandoned lifestyle of the new. We get a most evocative picture of the time but Bertolucci seems to be coming down a little heavy with the notion that the oldsters bankrolled the kids' excesses which achieved nothing. But then perhaps he's right. The film perhaps loses a little of it's assuredness towards the end but maybe the ambiguity is intended. Certainly the downbeat ending is appropriate and we can reflect on the fun we have had before with all the strange sex and wondrous film referencing complete with those delicious clips. Simply marvellous with some wonderful lines and sequences. Intoxicating.",The Dreamers
9,siderite,Strange enough to either like it or hate it,7,29 September 2005,"I didn't like it. :) It was too French for an American audience and too American for a European one. It was too sexual and unconventional for our parents, yet full of references to films that only they could possibly remember.In the end it felt like an interesting but boring project. I mean, Eva Green was pretty cute, although not particularly beautiful, but I've grown past the age when every film with nudity seemed interesting. The plot was certainly original, but I couldn't really relate to any of the characters. Maybe I'm a prude or something. The wife liked it, though, she found it exciting, even. I can't rate it above average.",The Dreamers
10,namashi_1,Caters to a niche audience...,4,1 March 2010,"Based on Gilbert Adair's novel The Holy Innocents, Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Dreamers' is a weird film about violence, sex & incest relationships. As my summary says, this one caters to a niche audience.'The Dreamers' is a boring film, and it does want it to be. Bertolucci has made remarkable films, his work is truly amazing. but 'The Dreamers' is amongst his weak efforts, he does bring in a lot of SEX & Nudity, but fails to leaves you awe-struck, which he mostly does in all of his films. Plus, due to the strong sexual content, it limits it's audience completely.Coming to the acting department, Eva Green steals the show with a fantastic performance. She's so natural, She's so much at ease from start to end. Michael Pitt is terrific. Louis Garrel is excellent, he matches up-to Green and Pitt in each frame.On the whole 'The Dreamers' disappoints, re-visit some other film from this prolific filmmaker!",The Dreamers
11,StevePulaski,An act of dire cinetimacy,9,20 June 2012,"NOTE: This review is constructed based on the NC-17 version of the film. I'm not sure how the R-rated DVD cut differs.The Dreamers is an exercise in something I like to call, cinetimacy. Cinetimacy is the act of blending cinephilia and eroticism into one film, naturally. I obviously made that up on the spot, but it's truly what I was thinking about during almost the entire film. Blending the love and passion for two things, film and sex, so nonchalantly and engagingly that, after a while, you forget you're watching people's fantasies.Some films exploit sex and some make it indulgent, like ones' particular fantasy (cough, cough, Paul Verhoenen's Showgirls). The Dreamers make the act strangely classy, and doesn't overcompensate its importance. It is a well-acted, intensely written French piece, directed by acclaimed director, Bernardo Bertolucci. His applied elegance quickly turns The Dreamers from possible exploitative fodder to a wonderful, sensuous work of art.We are greeted with Michael Pitt's, who appears to be a cross between Leonardo DiCaprio and Emile Hirsch, character Matt, a young, naive American foreign exchange student who is touring France during the time of heavy economic rebellions in 1968. A young cinephile, Matt finds he spends most of his time in the movie theater, immersed in a screen projecting high-art to its patrons, while they sit back in their lush red seats and smoke up a few. Matt soon meets Isabelle (played by the beautiful Eva Green) and her brother Theo (Louis Garrel), both of them, also, into very artistic French pictures. In their spare time, they like to intensely act out movie sequences for each other and then ask what it is from. If they get it wrong, they will take the ""prophet,"" but to them, that options doesn't always seem like such a bad thing.They hang out, become closer, until Matt realizes that Isabelle and Theo like to have sex with each other. They enjoy the pleasure and the sensation that comes out of it, and their incestuous desires aren't for what viewers might believe. Not instant gratification, but for the simple excitement and escapism behind it. Matt becomes one with them, choosing to move in with Isabelle and Theo, and embracing this life of difference, wrongness, yet rightness.The picture is photographed with luxurious takes, extremely beautiful cinematography, and some of the most enhancing colors this side of a Wes Anderson film. With repeated viewings, I can see nuances becoming more prominent, events becoming more significant, and minor little details, such as things found scattered around the film, to be more apparent and lively. This is the kind of luscious Italian film I've been searching for, sort of like the Suspiria of a different genre. A film that can tamper with a genre so much so that it could be labeled as ""transgressive,"" and you feel that you've witnessed something miraculous for reasons you can't decipher.Pitt, Green, and Garrel ignite remarkable on-screen chemistry, and the things they had to commit to in the film are astonishing and real. The sex isn't as hardcore as some are embellishing. They are rather, should I say, detailed, but there's nothing here that should shock the most optimistic and open-minded viewer. Especially one familiar with Italian cinema. I can easily see why it merited the NC-17 rating; the MPAA has always had an uncomfortable time with intimacy conveyed cinematically, yet let so much go unnoticed and undisturbed. At least Bertolucci didn't cop out to an R-rating.Perhaps the title references the idea that these three teenagers are living in their own world, outside of the violence, chaos, and catastrophe going on right on their doorstep. Perhaps it tries to inform us what could possibly happen if we go down the wrong road of rightness, yet feel so entranced as we do it. Or maybe it is just showcasing how intimacy can really effect judgment. Whatever it's doing, The Dreamers does a damn fine job doing it. The more you love cinema, the more you love nuances, and the more you love craft, the more desires the film will fulfill.Starring: Michael Pitt, Eva Green, and Louis Garrel. Directed by: Bernardo Bertolucci.",The Dreamers
12,=G=,A Bertolucci pet project,7,14 July 2004,"""The Dreamers"" is all about three young adult upscale hippy types who languish in a flat in Paris in the late 60's and talk about cinema, politics, sex, and other stuff while sharing some first experiences. Two are brother (Garrel) and sister (Green) identical twins (or so we're told) who have an almost metaphysical bond and the third is an interloper (Pitt) who falls in lust with the sister. There's little plot to this slice of young adult life flick which seems to be more of a Bertolucci pet project than a commercial product for the masses. Less than engaging and much less than compelling, ""The Dreamers"" immerses itself in the esoterics of the place and time to the exclusion of anyone who wasn't there then. Beautifully filmed and masterfully crafted with some young actors doing superb work under difficult circumstances with plenty of graphic nudity and sex, ""The Dreamers"" will play best with aficionados of French cinema, Bertolucci fans, etc. Those who are squeamish about sex/nudity should pass. All others, be prepared for a marginally interesting watch. (B)",The Dreamers
13,KineticSeoul,Not all that enjoyable but understandable when it comes to even today's dreamers,6,6 January 2012,"The title basically says it all, this movie is about 3 characters that just dream and talk about going places and doing stuff but does nothing. In another words they are just a bunch of talkers and not walkers, talkers that does some weird perverted stuff with each other. The movie takes place in the late 1960's in Paris. The only thing I basically found to be interesting is how the characters are movie buffs and live in there own world and the way they view the world with there own ideology. I also found some of the movie trivia parts and how the characters try to relive some of the movie scenes to be of some interest but not much. Also the main big thing that might be going for most viewers or the payoff for some is probably the full frontal nude scenes that feature Eva Green. The relationship between the three characters is very odd and out of the ordinary, you will just have to watch it to see what I am saying. One thing that I could understand in this movie was how so many people talk about there ideology and making a difference but go in a different direction without noticing it. I found this movie to be not all that enjoyable but it's completely understandable for even today's dreamers.6.3/10",The Dreamers
14,dromasca,very good film about one of the important years of the 20th century,9,30 July 2004,"1968 was an important year in my life, and one of the most important in the 20th century history. I was 15 then, and I was living the events of that year with the intensity of a teenager. That was the year of the young people in West taking the streets in a fight against the post WWII establishment, a fight that failed momentarily, but led to the change in Europe history and institutions that is felt until today. That was the year Dubcek tried to reform Communism from inside in Prague - he failed too, but the Iron Curtain fell two decades later. America was fighting a war in Vietnam that much of the world opposed, this does not seem to have changed! Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King were assassinated that spring - it looks like half of the history of the 20th century was concentrated in one year. That was the time of the Beatles, of the hippies,  Jimmy Hendrix and Janis Joplin were at their finest hour. Looking back this was one of the best years of my life, and this is one reason for me to love this film. It is  a good film by itself I believe - it has sophistication in describing the relationship between the three young people, it makes important points about the relationship between cinema and life, between  the revolution in theory, or in the bedroom and the revolution in the street, between American and European cultures, between violence and pacifism. It is wonderfully acted, well developed, and with very little overhead.  It has a lot of cinema quotes from other movies, and at least one scene (the bathroom tube scene) that will surely become a quote for the decades to come. Thanks Bertolucci, for the best film about that amazing year and the young people of that time. The film gets a 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",The Dreamers
15,Irishchatter,"Yeah, I kinda got bored of the movie........",2,4 April 2016,"I know its meant to be a weird threesome movie but, I think it was just too long and too fussy. I think the sex should've been kept to a minimum with this one. I mean, i have seen erotic movies where there is a lot of sex scenes but they were in perfect timing, this movie didn't in my opinion.I think having Michael Pitt as the American student wasn't a great idea. The writers were just too busy thinking of him as ""Leonardo DiCapro"" but he isn't DiCapro like! If they badly wanted him to be involved on this, they should really have made him grow out his hair and not wear those hideous costumes. They looked as if he was gonna get squished in them at any moment, like whenever he appears on screen! Or, they could've at least waited for DiCapro to finish his current film then. That would mean he would be able to continue to be involved on this film with Eva Green & Louis Garrel!Every actor was good looking on this but the storyline and the length of the film unfortunately, was not!",The Dreamers

17,Bored_Dragon,How I fell in love with Eva Green,10,16 February 2019,"Bernardo Bertolucci has always been one of my favorite directors, but with this film, he bought me for all time. ""The Dreamers"" is a film that I saw many times and I've never found the strength nor found the right words to describe and analyze it. This is an example of movie magic, and magic cannot be explained. Or maybe I do not want to try, fearing that by analyzing I could spoil my love for this movie. A strong story, perfect atmosphere, great music and a very good feeling for details. ""The Dreamers"" is full of references to many famous movies and, as my movie experience grows with years, every time I watch it the experience is getting stronger. Eva Green is fantastic and it's hard to believe that this is her first movie role. I'd be lying if I said that her nudity and sex scenes had no influence, but mostly I was fascinated by her overall appearance and a powerful presence on the screen, and this fascination holds me for fifteen years. The first cadre of the scene where she mimics Venus de Milo is one of the most beautiful erotic photographs I have ever seen.10/10",The Dreamers
18,johnnyboyz,"Never really very interesting, although made to look more-so due to the levels of nudity; The Dreamers skims from bit to bit demanding attention but garnering very little.",5,17 March 2011,"It was Peter Greenaway's film entitled 8 ½ Women in which he had his characters observe, whilst watching the Fellini film from whence the title took its inspiration, indeed ask, as to whether film-makers actually formulate works of art within the medium of cinema, or merely recreate their fantasies and put it all up there on screen when it comes to producing their latest piece. If the two slimy and shady, but disturbingly cultured in their own right, characters from said 1999 film in said scene were latching onto something then 2003's The Dreamers is a pure and unadulterated examples of Bernardo Bertolucci's fantasy made flesh; a fantasy splashed across the screen for all to observe. The film, about similarly cultured and European-based people whom are unable to control their sexual urges but do enjoy a good talk about high-art, is a quite infuriating and quietly grotesque piece about characters we either do not particularly like nor particularly pity flitting about in a hotbed of politics; love-making and cultural studies. The film unfolds in late 1960s Paris, a lone male American in Michael Pitt's Matthew is a child in a sweet shop; an exchange student living out in France with its capital city as his back garden venturing to and from anywhere he pleases. The scenario carries with it a sense of the fanciful, a lone young male old enough to be where he is by himself but most probably not yet really old enough to know any better; he's miles from home with nary an individual to keep an eye on him, his love for films quenched by a Parisian cinema showing everything that he likes and that sense of being caught up in something political or thoroughly important, what with numerous riots at the state's system, seemingly flanking him wherever he goes. Young Matthew's situation appears to get better before it even hints at getting any worse, even if he doesn't necessarily mind when everything comes off the rails around him, when he meets a stern-faced and quite adventurous young French woman named Isabelle, played by Eva Green in her screen debut. They meet through a battling of censorship or ill-advised government intervention when business linked to the cinema they all frequent faces some serious sanctions; Isabelle dragging him back to her home during which time he meets her brother Theo (Garrel) and the parents. Thence begins Matthew's ever excitement escalating, ever morally decaying Parisian misadventure with these people; people whom are typically French because they're cultured, frank in their attitudes to sex and nudity, philosophical and have the ability to garner frequent access to cheese-boards; thence begins Bernardo Bertolucci's fantasy of being a much younger man in a city such as Paris and into the sorts of things he's into; doing the sorts of things he's doing and meeting the sorts of people he's meeting. In an earlier draft of the screenplay, Theo may very well have been Isabelle's live-in lover; the manoeuvring of Matthew into a firmer relationship with her made easier by transforming him into a conjoined twin rendering everything a much less tasking exercise and allowing the disturbing nature of the frank relationship they all share to resonate more than it might. The three come to hang out with one another, bizarre games and challenges outside of the apartment lending equal time to indoor dares further-still leading onto some rather stark relations; their dialogue coming to form unrealistic exchanges more broadly linked to that of disagreements on certain film directors and accomplished musicians, unrealistic in the sense young adults with such immature attitudes to the world around them would be unable to engage in such conversations. Any statements here on young adults whom are seemingly yet to have completely move away from any adolescent tendencies still being of a 'smarter' ilk back in the day not ringing particularly true, contemporary garbage in the form of whatever you like not being around to pollute or distract them around or not. In the long run, the overwhelming sense of Pitt's character a nondescript template for a young man's dream to be pleasantly lost amidst a foreign culture; able to hold a conversation and having access to the sorts of people within the film, is simply too much to banish. This, with numerous and grating instances of the film's use of stock-footage as characters inexplicably speak of cinema; philosophy; Cahiers du Cinéma journals and various philosophical ideas whilst managing to worm in what appeared to be a mite of André Bazin's writing, not to mention a spin on a famous Sir Winston Churchill quote, is just annoying in its self-gratuity. The whole thing somewhat reeks of pomposity, its daring attitude in regards to its sexual content and frank nudity that ironically bare all but only serve to cover up most of its short-comings; its overall ambiance having it more often than not resemble barely much more than a series of lusty fabrications, the film's title may well be The Dreamers but the piece is mere fantasy.",The Dreamers
19,filipemanuelneto,The birth of a star.,5,14 July 2017,"After watching this movie I got the feeling that the strongest point of it is the participation of Eva Green, in her first movie by coincidence. The whole story is about three young students who are in Paris: two are French and are brothers, the third is an American and is doing an exchange to learn the country's language. Chemistry between them is intensified by their interest by cinema. From then on, the film beggins a series of debates (a little insipid to normal public but curious to the experts and movie-goers) about cinema, with cameos and tributes to several films and actors. Here, sometimes, its necessary to know cinema and to have some cinematic culture in order to follow everything. Then, as the events of May '68 take place, the three are getting more and more intimately involved. Sex is a structural part of the story from the beginning, its introduced very well by the sensuality and eroticism of Eva Green and isn't ugly or sinful, as in many films usually ends up becoming. However, full nudity scenes are many, can hurt sensibilities of more modest audiences and advise discretion before watch the movie.This film is about revolutions, hopes, yearnings, dreams, sex and cinema. Everything is mixed, everything is a vehicle for dreaming, for the estrangement of reality. But if it weren't for the absolutely fantastic performance of Eva Green, seductive, strong and mysterious, the film would not have half the interest or quality it has.",The Dreamers
20,howard.schumann,A gorgeously filmed ode to cinema,9,16 February 2004,"Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers is a gorgeously filmed ode to cinema that captures the pulse of Paris in the late 1960s, its bravery and idealism as well as its ambiguities. Based on The Holy Innocents, a novel by Gilbert Adair, The Dreamers joyously recreates the time of burgeoning student political awareness, sexual liberation, and heightened interest in world cinema. Interspersing clips from films such as Shock Corridor, Freaks, Breathless, Top Hat, and Mouchette with movie scenes reenacted by the characters, Bertolucci conveys a passion for cinema that allows a new generation to experience the glory days of the movies and the feeling of revolution in the air. Bertolucci is not intimidated by taboos and there is a lot of simulated sex and full frontal nudity that has resulted in an NC-17 rating but, beyond the squirm factor, none of it seems very shocking anymore. The film begins as a large protest is gathering over the firing of Henri Langlois as director of Cinematheque Francaise by Minister of Culture Andre Malraux. During the protest, Matthew (Michael Pitt), a blond twenty-year old Californian studying in Paris meets twins Theo (Louis Garrel), a young French student and his sister Isabelle (Eva Green). Isabelle, wearing a red beret, has chained herself to the Cinematheque gate but it is soon apparent that she is only playing at protest. Theo and Isabelle invite Matthew home to meet their father, a famous poet and mother, a British intellectual. When the parents go on vacation, Matthew moves from his hotel to share their elegant Paris apartment and the group embarks on a voyage of self-discovery that includes every variety of experimentation you can imagine and even some you cannot.Most of the film takes place inside the apartment. They drink vintage wine, smoke herbs, talk about revolution, have sex, talk about movies, then have more sex, all to an ingratiating soundtrack featuring artists such as Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and The Doors. The twins, who Matthew discovers sleep together, express their erotic fixation, playing mind games seeking to discover who has the most knowledge of cinema with the loser having to undergo a ""forfeit"", a form of sexual punishment. Theo and Isabelle play the role of sophisticate to naïve Matthew. ""You Americans don't understand your own culture"", Theo says to Matt. ""No wonder you never got the point of Jerry Lewis"". Matthew is awed by his friends' seeming worldliness but is shocked when he discovers that, for all her posing, Isabelle is a virgin, a dreamer playing the role of sophisticate.
There are scenes to warm the heart of every cinephile. In one exhilarating sequence, the three friends try to beat the record from Godard's Band of Outsiders by running through the Louvre. In another, Isabelle imitates the memory scene from Queen Christina as Bertolucci brings in the soundtrack. They argue the merits of great performers from the past such as Keaton and Chaplin, but for them cinema seems to be divorced from real life, and they appear unaware of the increasing politicization of the films of the French New Wave. Consistent with its title, The Dreamers is about young people who would rather dream than act. Afraid of being committed to anything outside of themselves, desperate to feel important, they are in love with the world in their head not the one outside their window. Theo talks about Mao and the Red Guard and is all for revolution except when it means taking some form of action. They try to exclude everything outside of their comfort zone, but life has a way of objecting. It is only when the world intrudes in the form of a political demonstration that comes crashing through their window do they get a powerful wake up call that may just have saved their life.",The Dreamers

22,freemantle_uk,"Eva Green Naked, what more do you want?",7,17 August 2008,"The Dreamers is a very strange film, looking at sexual and social relates and taboos, politics before and during the Paris Student Riots in 1968.The film focuses on Matthew (Michael Pitt), an American university student who was in Paris to study French. He has a love of film and it was a cinematheque linked to a museum. When the cinematheque was forced to close he befriends twins Isabelle and Theo (Eva Green and Louis Garrel). As the film goes on Matthew discovers that Isabelle and Theo's relationship is twisted and on the verge of being insectial. For example Isbelle and Theo share a bed together, and both play a game which the other has to guess a scene and if they can't they have do a forfeit. Matthew slowly falls in love with the twins, having a relationship with Isbelle, but also questions the twins relationship at times. He does also get involved in their activities, such as sharing a bath with the twins.Throughout the film it looks at sexual relations and politics. It also looks at a twisted relationship between the twins. However, because of the period the film is set in politics could not be avoided. Theo is a Maoist and during the film there is debates about revolution, warfare, pacifist, socialism, social issues and Vietnam. Matthew does argue with Theo over politics. There is also many cultural references throughout the film, there is debate on who's better, Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton (I personally favour Hendrix). There are also film references, such as the Freaks and Scarface (1932). A really good scene in the film is when the characters of the film try to copy a scene from Bande à part, where they race through the Louve. During that scene it cuts from the characters from the Dreamers and the scene from Bande à part.The film was well acted and does raise questions for the audience. The direction was decent and the script was okay.This film is very controversial and there are scene that will shock, even me who is use to and like some controversy. There is a lot of sex and nudity and could edge to close to porn. But this film is decent.",The Dreamers
23,ackstasis,"""Only the French would house a cinema inside a palace""",7,19 August 2010,"My first attempt at a Bernardo Bertolucci film was 'Last Tango in Paris (1971),' but the battered old VHS self-destructed on me long before the infamous slab of butter made an appearance. That film, of course, was both celebrated and condemned for its frank sexuality, and 'The Dreamers (2003)' was similarly introduced to me as a controversial, sexually-driven drama. Such a description misses the mark entirely. Bertolucci's film, set during the 1968 student riots in Paris, is the director's tender love-letter to the art of cinema. As a city falls apart amid civil unrest, one element remains constant: those wonderful cinematic moments imprinted on celluloid, resonating with audiences even decades after they were captured. To illustrate their timelessness, Bertolucci frequently juxtaposes his favourite movie moments with similarly-framed shots from his main narrative, emphasising their relevance even in contemporary times.Yet, there is also an additional level at play – a self-criticism of sorts. The film's resident cinephilics, brother and sister Theo (Louis Garrell) and Isabelle (Eva Green), often talk of social revolution, but nevertheless spend most of their time engrossed in the cinematic past. When Theo ultimately joins the student riots, discarding his romanticism in favour of Molotov cocktails, I wasn't sure how to respond: was it a betrayal? Or was it the awakening from a dream? Bertolucci reflectively and affectionately captures the milieu of the late 1960s counterculture, a time of social and cultural upheaval. The three main actors – including Michael Pitt as an American student living in Paris – are convincing in extremely gutsy roles, and the gamble paid off for at least one of the trio: Eva Green turned out to be the next Bond girl, and a very memorable one at that, in 'Casino Royale (2006).'",The Dreamers
24,meeza,Sexdreaming,7,6 September 2004,"First and foremost, 'The Dreamers' is not based on those optimistic Miami Dolfans who are somehow convinced that the Fins will make the playoffs this year. Sorry Fins! 'The Dreamers' is a dreamy, revolutionary, exotic, controversial, incestial film that is definitely an eye-opener. Legendary Director Bernardo Bertolucci's story of a young American's relationship with a couple of expressive French twins will evoke some wet dreams in you. 'The Dreamers' is based in France during the late 60's youth cinematheque revolution. It is an off-based true story. Michael Pitt stars as Matthew, the introverted American college student who is an avid film buff. In his cinematheque excursions, he befriends Isabelle & Theo (Eva Green & Louis Garrel) the French sexually fried twins who must have done a good share of french kissing during their childhood development. What transpire from this triad group? Is it a 'menage a' trios' 60's style? I will not answer these intriguing questions. However, I will state that the film was rated a 'Can See 17', I mean an 'NC 17'. One of the most enlightening aspects of 'The Dreamers' was the love our main characters share for the cinema. Their lives revolve and are controlled by it. However, what I found to be nightmarish of 'The Dreamers' was that these characters at times tended to be displayed as ignorant play puppets except in the scenes where they expressed cinematic analogies & inquiries. Even though it was a pleasurable viewing, the sex of the film did not present any insightful messages of our protagonists. However, Bernardo I am not trashing your flick. As your legendary 'Last Tango in Paris', it was bravismo of you to direct 'The Dreamers'! But please 'dream on' if I would list this film as one of the paramount films of the year. *** Average",The Dreamers

Mathew (who was born to understudy Dicaprio but is still enticing in his vulnerable but verile performance as a wannabe aesthete) is our audience surrogate to discover the strange, less than familial world of the Twins as they laughably try to be intellectuals (have I been there), binge on much more famous movies and (of course) SE BAISER.For all its stylishness and weird conversations, the affect can seem somewhat naive and fragmented without much real drive plot-wise. But I've decided I like this aspect.It's a snapshot of people who seek to keep a dream alive, one that needs to fill an empty reality, a dream of peace and love that must eventually end.

26,Chris_Docker,"Sex, film history and politics (or soft porn for socialites)",8,6 February 2004,"The DreamersIt was the May and June of 1968 in France. Student uprisings were occurring in many countries, frequently in response to the U.S. war in VietNam, but in France the situation was more complex and more embracing. Amongst those taking to the streets were cinephiles, protesting over the way film was distributed and also its political content. French New Wave cinema was born, led by such people as Godard and Truffaut. Riots broke out and strikes ensued. Godard and Truffaut both received a beating in the mayhem and fights (which involved tear gas and Molotov cocktails).The film's story starts just before all this. A Californian youth (Matthew) meets up with two fellow film buffs (Theo and Isabelle, who are brother and sister) and they become close friends, united by youthful hedonism, a bohemian, revolutionary spirit, and a love of cinema that spills over into elaborate games and dares, testing each other's knowledge of movies. The film's elements include the developing sexual challenges between the three main characters, the atmosphere of political unrest and uprising, and a detailed questioning of various cinematic trends. A backdrop of some of the best sound recordings of the time (Hendrix, Pink Floyd, The Doors) uses analogous developments and confrontations in music, characteristic of that period. Director Bertolucci (of Last Tango in Paris), also pushes at the boundaries of censorship with the sexual themes and degree of full frontal nudity (censorship was a major issue in French cinema in the late sixties  today it is U.S. distributors that are complaining about the nudity in The Dreamers). There are also political dilemmas represented by the pacifist Matthew (who feels he has been lucky to dodge the draft) and the French siblings who preach love but allow their left-wing sympathies to not rule out violence. In an interesting debate about film, or viewing one's life as a film, Theo expresses admiration for Mao's red army and what a wonderful film that would make  but Matthew points out that in such a film everyone would be extras, no-one would be special'.The final mix in The Dreamers is a heady cocktail for serious film lovers, but not mainstream by any standards.

Then the three youngsters decide to bring their relationship to a more, uh, intimate level...Movie-buffs are gonna love the first half of the movie, where the protagonists' (and the director's) love for classic films is visible in every frame (the debate about the greatest comedian ever - Chaplin or Keaton - is brilliant), while in the second part the sex takes over, though still connected to cinema (the first sex acts are punishments for losing a homemade movie quiz), and it's pretty graphic lovemaking indeed (but what would you expect from the man who gave us Last Tango in Paris?)...A very interesting and well acted movie, although it's slightly disappointing that Bertolucci doesn't give us more than a glimpse of the riots which should have had a more important role, given the time and place the story is set in.

As tales of foreign dislocation go, this runs circles around ""Lost in Translation,"" and ups the erotic ante to a place so casual that some mentalities may be downright uncomfortable with the lack of sensationalism present. In what is essentially a scaled-down variation on Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim,"" director Bernardo Bertolucci places American student Matthew (Michael Pitt, full of marquee-icon beauty) in Paris, where he meets up with Isabelle (the luscious Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel), whose ambiguous relationship runs the gamut from siblings to twins to lovers; the trio become enmeshed in a love triangle that extends for a month, in the midst of the escalation of military operations in Vietnam and a Communist uprising in France. Bertolucci opens with images of outcry against a blacklisted filmmaker, and concludes with a less-than-convincing paralleling of political protest (the axiom that ""all art is political"" given an overly literal connotation). The at-times distracting political aspect, however, is a minor complaint in what is, at heart, a hypnotically engaging account of three mysterious teens in the midst of their sexual awakening. ""The Dreamers"" is, as another critic has already stated, a wonderful valentine to love--and to cinema itself.",The Dreamers
33,rbverhoef,"Good, but I was not really able to connect",7,9 May 2005,"'The Dreamers' is a beautiful film, no doubt about it, but I never really connected with it. It is directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, set in Paris in 1968 against the backdrop of the cultural revolution. It has explicit sex scenes, great performances and beautiful images. It is about sex, politics and cinema, and for me most of the joy came from the parts about cinema.Michael Pitt plays Matthew, an American student in Paris, who spends most of his time with going to the movies. There he meets twins Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel). He is invited to their place, has dinner with their family (their father is a famous French poet) and when the parents leave for a month he is invited to stay with the two. Soon he learns the relationship between is not a normal one. They play little games where they ask questions about films and when the other does not know the answer he or she has to make up for that. Theo has to masturbate in front of a Marlene Dietrich poster and later Isabelle has to make love to Matthew, who must play along as well.In between we get images from what is happening outside, and it is not strange that the film has its crucial moments right there. But for me the most interesting moments really are when Bertolucci intercuts between his characters who replay scenes from films and the real film they are dealing with. We see Jean-Luc Godard's 'À Bout de Soufflé', Tod Browning's 'Freaks', and Rogers/Astaire musical 'Top Hat'. Then we go back to the characters in their dream world, their movie world, with only Matthew who seems to realize they have to wake up at one point.I loved these moments. I loved the images I saw, I admired the performances very much, but I never really felt anything for them. Sometimes I was reminded of Bertolucci and his 'Last Tango in Paris', another film with graphic sex scenes set in Paris. That film also had characters I did not like very much, but they were well acted and it looked very good. Qualities like that it definitely has, so if you can connect to the story (maybe because you are a little older than I am) you will probably love this one. I liked it.",The Dreamers
34,rosscinema,A look back by Bertolucci,8,22 February 2004,"This is definitely a film made for those of you that were lucky enough to be a film goer in the late sixties and early seventies when film was considered an important art form. This story takes place in Paris, France in 1968 when Henri Langlois who was the founder of the Cinematheque Francais was ousted and this started a chain of violent riots between the supporters of Langlois and the police. At a protest rally an American student named Matthew (Michael Pitt) meets Isabelle (Eva Green) and after chatting she introduces him to her twin brother Theo (Louis Garrel). They invite Matthew to stay with them in their home while their parents are away for a month and it doesn't take long for him to discover that Theo and Isabelle have a strange and unique brother/sister relationship.*****SPOILER ALERT*****The three of them spend their time talking about films and politics and they start to play games that involve sex. Isabelle loses a game and Theo tells her to have sex with Matthew who is reluctant but goes through with it and finds out that he has taken Isabelle's virginity. After time passes Matthew starts to think about his role as a pawn in their sex games and how different they are in their attitudes dealing with certain issues.This film is directed by the great Bernardo Bertolucci and it's easy to see that he has a personal passion and fondness for that certain time period. The film is a real treat for serious movie buffs and the characters here frequently recite lines of dialogue from other films. Also, this film inter-cuts from the actions that the characters are engaged in to clips of older films that mirror what is taking place. Bertolucci does a good job of recreating the mood of the times and the attitudes that the youth had during those chaotic years. Even though I do admire this film I do think that Bertolucci is trying to recapture a moment that he mastered in ""Last Tango in Paris"". This story greatly resembles that film and it's almost impossible not to make some sort of comparison. Eva Green gives the films best performance and she displays both strength and maturity that is rare for a relatively unknown actress. Watching her career develop will be an interesting one to watch. As is the case with most of Bertolucci's films there is a requirement for an abundant amount of nudity for both female and male actors and this has me think about the casting of Pitt in the lead role. Pitt is a good young actor and he deserves lots of credit for allowing his genitalia to be shot in a close-up but he doesn't really possess screen presence. Since most American actors will not do full frontal nudity I suspect Bertolucci had very little choice in which actor to cast in the lead. Even if it seems obvious what Bertolucci is trying to recapture I'm still grateful that we live in a time where there are still a few filmmakers around to remind us that film is an art form and should be made accordingly. It's been over 30 years since ""Tango"" came out and you have to ask yourself what went wrong since then? This is a gutsy and intriguing piece of work that would seem common place in the early seventies but now your hard pressed to find an audience that is sophisticated enough to view this for what it is.

I know it will be visually beautiful, deep and meaningful. Even when he is not completely successful  his films are difficult to forget. It applies to ""The Dreamers"" (2003)In this film, Bertolucci returns to Paris of 1968. His First Tango is as shocking as Last one  it received NC-17 rating for very open scenes of nudity, masturbation, sex, and the hints to incest. But it is not just about sex  it is about film itself. It was the time when Pauline Kael said, ""Bertolucci and Brando have altered the face of an art form"". It was the time when a crowd in Chicago would line up under umbrellas on the sidewalk, waiting in the rain to get into the next screening of Godard's ""Weekend."" It was the time when movie makers became the Artists. It was the time when closing down of the famous Cinematheque Francais in Paris by the government started the student culture riots which became the part of youthful rebellion all over the Western World.Young American, Mathew, a devoted movie buff (Michael Pitt who by the opinion of several reviewers looks like cross between Leo DiCaprio and Macaulay Culkin. I found him looking more like young Roger Ebert would've. ) becomes friends with two French students and fellow movie lovers, twins Isabella (Eva Green, in a star making debut) and Theo (Louis Garrel) and accepts their invitation to stay with them at their apartment while their intellectual parents are away for vacation.All three are big fans of movies  they not only talk about movies, they live their favorite scenes. ""The Dreamers"" is Bertolucci's love letter to cinema, and his irony toward people taking it so seriously that the real world is ignored.When Matthew moves in with the twins, the result closely resembles ""Last Tango in Paris"". Much of the film's second half occurs in that apartment, as insular as Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider's more than thirty years ago. Flirting becomes passion becomes dark and dangerous games to see how far someone will go. The difference is that the kids of ""The Dreamers"" are not as complicated and interesting as Paul or Jeanne (especially Paul, one of the greatest performances by genius Brando).With this wistful ode to sex, cinema, and the heated atmosphere of the '60s, Bertolucci has proved that he is still on the top of his game.

In that we were...well, let's use the word dreaming."" The film starts with Matthew's love to Cinema and how in those days there was a real passion for Cinema and Paris was the perfect place for Cinema lovers like Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut and Claude Chabrol. But later the film centers in only one house. The two brothers are dependents from each other and they have a very strange and unique relation. Matthew first is impressed and confused but soon he will be one of them. The big love between the three will be all they need so they will forget about the world, literally. But soon they will awake from their ""dream"" and realize that the world is still there, so they must deal with the reality of 1968.The time in which the film is set is just amazingly used with these three characters and there are many memorable moments that every true Cinema lover will appreciate. From discussions about who is funnier between Chaplin and Keaton to recreations of famous scenes from films like ""Bande à part"" and the original ""Scarface."" And the music of The Doors, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin is just amazing. I love a lot The Doors and the song ""The Spy"" is just perfect for this film.About the cast: the three main roles are played in a great way.

For young college kids in Any Campus, USA, that would be like letting the cork out of a well-shaken bottle of beer: all that gold liquor would come spewing out in an orgy of bacchanalia and you'd have any combinations of American PIE, PORKY'S, and ANIMAL HOUSE. Not in Paris: these young kids are true idealists in every sense of the word; they are in complete love with the theories of cinema, directors (Theo, in one scene, quotes: ""Nicholas Ray is cinema.""), and the love of reenacting scenes from their favorite films.Of course, such reenactments come with sexual overtones, and this threesome play with more than their minds: their own sexuality comes into play. Isabelle is a little more than taken with Matthew, but is bound to Theo in more ways than she can possibly, truly understand. Matthew has discovered them in bed together, naked, and later Isabelle has Theo perform a sexual act ""as if he were alone"" while she and Matthew watch. Indeed, there is a deep incestuous streak in her relationship with Theo, and she even prides herself in saying he has been ""inside"" her often. However, a game in which Matthew must forfeit and gets almost raped by both Theo and Isabelle into having sex with her -- in which they discover her picture hidden inside his shorts in a compromising place -- discloses that Isabelle may have been a virgin all along: her blood, which later arouses her and Matthew as much as it has her shed tears of womanhood, is the smoking gun.However, there is a moment when Theo makes it quite clear that Matthew is an outsider and that even when he has been ""inducted"" to be one of them (Bertolucci includes shots of FREAKS as a key element as he does with other movies to enhance a mood, or a parallel sequence). Matthew, despite this sudden warning, glides along, getting deeper and deeper into his threesome, until a moment comes when Isabelle has decided to end it all, herself, her life and that of her brother and her friend. It made me wonder if she was aware that perhaps she couldn't have them both -- that a part of her would be bound to Theo, and that other part of her, the more carnal aspect, the one which had made her a woman, would want Matthew. It's a disturbing moment, placid, perfect, and dangerous, but one in which the outside world literally comes crashing in... ending their acquaintance, possibly in an irrevocable manner.Bertolucci is, as always, a subtle storyteller who knows the type of movie he is making. The music is fantastic, classic rock at its best, deeply rooting it in its year. The sex is graphic -- there is full frontal nudity on behalf of the three leads. I don't believe this is shocking -- violence, to me, certainly is -- inasmuch as necessary to tell such an erotic plot, and to establish the intimacy between the three. The way they interact is as if they'd known each other forever -- a closeup in which Matthew exchanges ideas with Isabelle while his head rests above her private part is quite moving and devoid of titillation. Ditto for a scene later in the film which introduces Isabelle, topless, wearing black gloves, in front of a black background, looking like a living Venus de Milo. While Theo, off screen, enjoys sex with another girl and sparks her insane jealousy, she allows Matthew to enjoy her own body as well.Will people think Bertolucci has lost it? I don't think so. He has never shied away from sex in his films and erotic scenes are intrinsic to the story being told. THE DREAMERS may not quite break grounds, but it is an important movie about an important time in cinema and today no director in Hollywood seems to have what it takes to make this kind of film without calling too much attention to itself. Such a thing is what makes THE DREAMERS a film for people with special attitudes -- or Europeans -- sex is a natural thing, something which is a part of these characters, and not an excuse to show hard bodies on screen. It's a great little story, deliberate, and somewhat ambiguous by design, bookended by spurts of violence and those notorious riots.",The Dreamers
38,Lady_Targaryen,"When Politics, sex, films and books are all united.....",6,12 August 2006,"Based on Gilbert Adair's novel'' The Holy Innocents'', ''The Dreamers'' is a very different movie from the conventional ones I am used to watch. Isabelle and Theo, the twins, has a very intimate relationship for brothers that I don't understand very well and Matthew, their new American friend (and lover) starts to accept the way they are and fall in love with both of them. One thing I need to complain about the movie, is the hypocrisy that I read in the trivia section, saying that if they show Matthew's and Theo's relationship it might have been ""too much'' for the public, but Theo and Isabelle, that are brother and sister, can sleep together and have the most unusual behavior of all. I don't agree with that and if I needed to choose something that would ''shock'' someone, an ambiguous relationship between brothers would be much more shocking then a gay relationship.Anyway, Matthew is a young American exchange student that came to Paris in order to study French. The year is 1968, and he easily become friend of the twins Isabelle and Theo, since they three love to watch movies. As their friendship grows, Matthew learns of the extreme intimacy shared by Isabelle and Theo and enters into their world. First he falls for Isabelle for later also love Theo, and the three seclude themselves from the world, falling further and further from the reality of the 1968 student riots.",The Dreamers
39,stensson,Time goes by,3,22 February 2004,"It's sad to see. Bertolucci was one of the most influential film makers in the 70s. It seems like he never left that decade. ""The Dreamers"" is not all right.It's 1968 and a twin brother and a twin sister will be alone in their parent's Paris apartment. They invite an American student to live with them. They are dreamers, while the riots go on outside in the streets. Yes, there is also some sex here and the twins are almost incestous.Bertolucci seems to be saying: -""Look at these great young people and watch how they approach life and death! Learn from them"" That's not an interesting view. Not if it is done like this. The 70s are over. Is Bertolucci the last one to know?",The Dreamers
40,Spuzzlightyear,Beautiful Dreamers,9,26 June 2005,"Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Dreamers' is a movie that just made me DIE. A total salute to the movies that he loves, blending in with ooh-la-la ménage-a-trois featuring an American tourist and 2 French siblings. The American and the siblings get along famously, and next thing you know, the American has moved in with him, getting into some rather interesting situations. This whole thing takes place in Paris in 1968, during a protest of the Cinematheque Francais and the catastrophic general strike that followed it. All of which Bertolucci replicates beautifully in the film. The cast, which is led by Michael Pitt in a role originally thought for Leonardo DiCaprio and Jake Gyllenhal. Yeah, right.. Dream on. Let me tell you one thing, this movie wouldn't be half the movie it is without the risks Michael Pitt takes in this. He's laying it all out (literally) in the movie for us to see. His sometimes tricky relationship with the two Frenchies and his quest to understand them is sometimes painful to watch, and Pitt is quite surprisingly excellent in the role, the two French actors playing the siblings, Louis Garrel and Eva Green, are quite believable as the siblings, and their relationship with each other is quite detailed in this. OK, as you can tell, I have tried not to reveal, you know, the naughty bits about the movie.. (eg, this film GLORIFIES INCEST! IT HAS MALE NUDE SCENES!) There. I've covered the topic. Now, will you just see the movie? It's so good.",The Dreamers
41,hall895,Certainly unique,6,31 May 2006,"It is safe to say you're not going to see many movies like The Dreamers. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is somewhat hard to say. This movie certainly has a lot going for it but it never quite seems to come together. It's undeniably interesting, at times bordering on downright fascinating. There are enough moments of brilliance to make you think this movie could be something truly special. But in the end The Dreamers falls just short of greatness. Good, certainly worth seeing and discussing, but not great.The Dreamers is set in Paris in 1968, a very interesting time in a very interesting place. The seeds of revolt were being sown, demonstrators taking the city by storm. Surrounded by this maelstrom of activity are the three main characters this film will follow. Michael Pitt plays Matthew, a young American ostensibly studying in Paris who actually spends most of his time watching films at the Cinematheque Francais. There is where he will first encounter fellow film buffs Isabelle, played by Eva Green, and Theo, played by Louis Garrel. Isabelle and Theo are twins who are very close. Disturbingly close as Matthew will soon find out when the twins invite him to move into their apartment while their parents are away. As Matthew is drawn into Isabelle and Theo's world he can't help but feel a little uncomfortable and the viewer may well feel a little uncomfortable as well. Suffice to say this is not what one would call a normal relationship and just how unusual this relationship is will be depicted rather explicitly.The Dreamers is certainly not for the prudish but if you can get past the explicit portrayal of this rather unusual relationship there is much to recommend the film. The three lead actors, who basically have to carry the entire film, all do a fine job. Especially noteworthy is newcomer Green who tackles a role in which all inhibitions must be tossed aside. A unique plot device in which these three film buffs act out scenes from great films while the original scenes themselves are inter-cut adds a rather unique and enjoyable touch. So there are some very good pieces to work with here but in the end it leaves you wanting more. With all that is going on outside in the streets of Paris the somewhat bizarre story unfolding inside the apartment doesn't quite hold up. It was a time of great change in Paris but for much of the film the main characters seem oblivious to that, stuck in their own little world. These three characters have an interesting and certainly unique story to tell. But you're left with the sense that in being so focused on one another these three figures, and by extension we the audience, missed out on the events of the time which truly mattered.",The Dreamers
42,aciessi,"From Paris, With Love",9,5 November 2015,"What a wonderful movie. The Dreamers is a love letter to the French New Wave, with all the spectacular erotica that Bertolucci can offer. It's a celluloid porno.. literally speaking. Finally, film fetishism and hardcore sex meet at last. The performances from the trio of lovers are outstanding and brave. Like all of his movies, Bertolucci asks for nearly everything from his actors, and every time, it never fails. Clothes come flying off. I always seem to respond very positively to art house films that veer towards pornography. It's not because I get a thrill out of it. There is something so powerful and intimate about sex on film. Sex is the most private, vulnerable state of the human experience. Through the sheets, we see our characters completely unravel. Granted you have to be a good actor for this to work. If this were entirely the case, than every porn movie would be up for an Oscar.",The Dreamers
43,gregsrants,"Ultimately, forgettable",5,8 February 2004,"Bernardo Bertolucci's obsession with France and sex continues in his new film The Dreamers, not likely to make it to a theatre near you.  The film takes place in 1968 Paris and at press time, the director and the studio were not backing down from their final cut of the film, and therefore, The Dreamers will be released with the kiss of death NC-17 rating for its strong sexual content. The Dreamers follows the lives of three young adults with a love for cinema and a distinct and insatiable sexual appetite.  Louis Garrel and Eva Green play Theo and Isabelle, a brother and sister who meet American Mathew, played by Michael Pitt (Murder by Numbers).  Together, they embark on a sexual journey of borderline incest and peer pressure brought by various movie trivia games.  There is no denying that Bertolucci likes his sexual content.  Go through his filmography, and you will see film titles like Last Tango in Paris, Stealing Beauty and Il Conformista.  All may be films you have heard of or even seen, but their original cuts are harder to find this side of the Atlantic.  The Dreamers therefore, falls nicely into his niche.  After Mathew moves in with Theo and Isabelle, it is not long before we see the three engaging in voyeurism, and eventually explicit sexual acts. Bertolucci does not shy from the nudity, and audiences are subjected to every body part that can possibly be exposed, in full frame close ups for extended scenes.  There is not much meat to the overall story.  The three begin a journey that eventually leads to nowhere and with each group not learning or growing despite their exposure to each others ideals.  But I guess that was the point.  To show the differences between American and European views on sex, and the stubbornness of each culture to accept the norms or values of the other.Like Last Tango, The Dreamers does not have a huge supporting cast.  The characters spend almost all their time inside the Paris apartment vacated by their parents, telling stories, taking baths and drinking wine.  Lots of wine.  The act like children, and it is because of this that you may find it hard to connect with any of the characters.The Dreamers is mostly a forgettable film.  Although the cast does some charming work and the visuals are as stunning as any Bertolucci film, it is not a film that you will long remember once you leave the theatre, and although there is plenty of nudity, Bertolucci has a knack of throwing it at you so often that you become numb to the fact that the costume designer got a free ride.   It's hard to believe that this was the same director that swept through the Academy Awards with The Last Emperor 15 years ago.Michael Pitt is the lone standout and I suppose he thought The Dreamers would be for him what Stealing Beauty was for Liv Tyler, that being a talked about, but little seen title that must wait for late night cable before there is an audience.  For his sake, I hope that he is correct and his scenes are not for the internet x-rated sites alone.",The Dreamers
44,TheNorthernMonkee,"well made, but incredibly pretentious and superficial",5,2 June 2005,"SPOILERS In the modern world the definition of 'student' is clear. Expected to drink a lot, do no work and have strong political views, the notion of students as revolutionary thinkers is as strong now as it used to be.In 1968 perhaps the most famous student revolt of all time took place. In Paris, France, thousands of students, upset at the apparent evilness of their Government, rose up and rioted. Based on a doctrine of socialism and flying soviet flags, the students thought with their minds and fought with their hearts. Ultimately though, like most students of today, you find yourself wondering how many truly believed in the philosophy and how many merely wanted to appear intellectual or fit into a group.Based upon three students in Paris at the time, ""The Dreamers"" appears to demonstrate the way in which cinema obsessives of the time would hide themselves in closed worlds whilst sprouting doctrine as if it were truth. The film is actually incredibly beautifully shot and contains a superb soundtrack. Ultimately though, with a weak conclusion (a sturdy message, but no resolution), an over use of sex and a message almost pretentious in it's portrayal, the film fails on many levels.Matthew (Michael Pitt) is an American studying French in Paris. Devoting a lot of his time to the cinema, Matthew is overjoyed when he makes friends with brother and sister Theo (Louis Garrell) and Isabelle (Eva Green). As the three begin to spend increasing amounts of time together, Matthew finds himself drawn into the closed and self contained life of the pair, whilst simultaneously feeling stuck on the outside. As the old phrase said ""Twos company, threes a crowd"".Shot beautifully by Bernardo Bertolucci, ""The Dreamers"" gives the impression of being incredibly thought provoking and powerful. Set at a time of civil unrest and featuring three well acted performances by an unknown cast, the film has all the makings of a true classic. It's a shame therefore that it just doesn't work.Arrogant in quantity, ""The Dreamers"" is one of those films that people feel they are intellectual just by watching. Watched either by people think they are clever or by those who like the idea of the large amount of nudity (of which there is an excessive amount), the film never really gets to grips with the issues at hand. Yes it makes bold statements, and yes one or two of these are truly amazing concepts (Matthew pondering a lighter and his final speech to Theo are highlights), but for so much of the film you find yourself hating these characters and the story. It is just so superficial that it is hard to take seriously. The film acts like just by sprouting the occasional word of wisdom, you are intelligent. It is, for lack of a better choice, an intellectual soft-core porn film. You see nudity, you see even more nudity, and yet that's OK because one of the characters has just said something profound. No! Gilbert Adair is probably a nice man and writing ""The Dreamers"" he probably truly thought he was creating a piece of cinema to go down in history alongside some of the films he covers. Unfortunately though, he just doesn't get the balances right.Impressions of ""The Dreamers"" are also not helped by Adair's weak finale. As one predictable event unfolds, history begins to take control of the event. Then the character Matthew makes an amazing speech, only for the film to then conclude thirty seconds later. The script could, and arguably should, have continued for at least twenty minutes more. Conclusions aren't reached, plot lines aren't tied off, and the story just finishes with another sign of arrogant beauty. It attempts to leave a poignant finale, but instead you find yourself wanting to slap the writer and director for not working together to properly conclude the piece.It's hard to know why this film deserves to be praised. Increasingly arrogant throughout, the film tries to trick it's audience, just like most of the characters, into feeling intellectual just for watching a piece of cinema. If you talk to someone who thinks they're smart, this is one of those films which they will praise. Like Nietzsche is for books, ""The Dreamers"" is for cinema. It's a chance to show intelligence without actually having any.""The Dreamers"" is arrogance personified. Vain, ignominious and superficial, the film is not well written, and is definitely overly laden with sex. Still, despite all this, it is still occasionally beautiful to watch. Creating tributes to classic films, the occasional camera work by Bertolucci is a joy to watch. Unfortunately this one bonus just adds to the problem that the film is both pretentious and superficial. You should watch this film, but only so that you can shout down any 'intellectual' who tells you it's good.",The Dreamers

He loves cinema and he does watch movies a lot. One day outside the theater he meets ISABELLE (Eva Green) and THEO (Louis Garrel), sister and brother who also love cinema. They start being friends and after a few days THEO invites MATTHEW to stay in their house. He accepts. In the beginning everything was ""normal"" but then, suddenly, MATTHEW gets shocked when he finds out the ""special relationship"" this brother and sister have He gets involved in their ""way of life"" and falls in love with ISABELLE. An unusual love triangle begins This movie is provocative, intense, unusual and remarkable. These are just some adjectives that can describe it, but it's a lot more! It mixes issues like politics, cinema, love, sex, friendship, incest, betrayal, freedom, but most of all it's an exercise to test our closed and standardized occidental minds, because it pushes to the limits some canons which are ""sacred"" in our current society! I think that many will see this movie as wrong, perverted or even a sacrilege, but I think it's just an exercise to test your moral concepts. It's an exercise of free-will and the search of the inner-truth These characters live their world on their own way, never caring too much about rules or about the moral concepts of society, but on the other hand they feel oppressed by them, especially ISABELLE.The acting is very good. Eva Green is an excellent actress but she's also gorgeous, a true hymn to women's beauty, and I'm quite sure we will never see her again as we see her in this movie! I would like to mention the soundtrack either which is excellent, including too many songs from that period, from some French artists, Jimmy Hendrix, etc.It's provocative and unusual, but it's a remarkable film indeed",The Dreamers

47,lawprof,"Imperfect But, Nonetheless, an Important Bertulucci Film",7,7 February 2004,"Bernardo Bertulucci has a solid place in modern filmmaking.  A genuine iconoclast, he has produced movies of lasting value although, perhaps, of more interest to serious cinema lovers and film academics than to a wider audience.Bertulucci's vision of film is that of a political activist in a director's chair.  Film to him matters for far more than its transient entertainment value.  Bertulucci has stated that ""cinema is the true poetic language"" and in ""The Dreamers"" he has gone further than in previous efforts to unite a love of film with his heartfelt belief that it encompasses and presents the realities of both personal experience and political change and turmoil.The year is 1968.  It was, as I well remember as a military intelligence, General Staff Army officer in the Pentagon, a disturbing and troubled year. Anti-war demonstrations, often violent, racial unrest leading to major upheavals in America's cities, Resurrection City, distrust of government and the political process, the ""Police Riot"" during the Chicago Democratic Convention - these and other events were the fragile tinderboxes of widespread dissent.  But compared to France, the United States was experiencing unpleasant but ultimately absorbed and defanged behavior The country's youth, a minority of them, demonstrated, a few committed major crimes and most cared about futures in which they believed.  Racial bigotry and discrimination produced some change, not enough but not so little as to sustain recurring rioting.In France the Republic came close to falling as first students and then workers battled police with a fierceness that threatened social and political stability.  Three characters in ""The Dreamers,"" each a devoted cinephile, fall into an unusual - and for some audience members today unsettling-  menage a trois as they try to reconcile a love of film with a Paris of threatening disorder and violent change.American Matthew, played by a dreamily listless Michael Pitt, is using his student deferment to study French.  At a demonstration protesting the government-ordered closing of a major movie theater devoted to    the full range of film history, he meets beautiful Isabel, Eva Green, and her brother, Theo, Louis Garmel.  A friendship quickly develops and the siblings invite Mathew to their parent's spacious but cluttered apartment, first for a meal and then to stay while the parents go on holiday.Theo disdains his author/father and behaves like the petulant child he really is.  He fancies himself an intellectual but Bugs Bunny has expressed deeper thoughts. Theo is the stereotype of the ""don't trust anyone over thirty"" character of those days.Matthew realizes that Theo and Isabel are unusually close for siblings.  In point of fact they have a physical relationship, the depth of which is never fully revealed.  Matthew is drawn into explicitly shown sex with Isabel, the reason for the rare NC-17 that is the movie's rating (I.D. was actually checked at the ticket booth and anyone looking south of age 25 had to proffer acceptable documentation).  Too many reviews of this movie emphasize the incestuous relationship to the exclusion of more important themes.The trio acts out various tableaux based on questions about classic film scenes which are interspersed throughout the game-playing which is a central part of the siblings' interaction.  However sensational the sex scenes are to some, Bertulucci's key success is showing the insidious transformation of harmless games into a coda for sexuality and political belief and action. For Theo, film is a reality that transmogrifies his world view.  An increasingly credulous, and sensible, Matthew is madly in lust with Isabel but when Theo asks him to consider China's Great Cultural Revolution as a glorious film with Mao as director and millions as the cast he knows something is amiss with his friend.In the Bertulucci tradition of a film within a film, the three-way sexual relationship is both an encounter with and a retreat from reality.  But the world can't be kept at bay forever as Bertulucci shows in the final scenes.Hardly a perfect film, ""The Dreamers"" is, once the sexual explicitness is relegated to its proper place, a homily about how film matters but that it may not always be a safe harbor for its devotees.  The non-physical relationship of the three young people is far deeper and more interesting than the erotic aspect.There's little chance a movie with an NC-17 rating will be in many theaters or play long in those where it is booked.  But anyone serious about the relevance of a vibrant cinema owes Bertulucci a careful viewing of ""The Dreamers.""At the end of the trailer there was a magnificent absurdity (this can't possibly be deemed a spoiler).  We're all used to being assured that no animals were harmed during filming.  This one proclaims that ""Indigenous trees were planted to offset the release of carbon dioxide during filming."" Political correctness to the nth degree.7/10.",The Dreamers
48,BlackJack_B,A beautiful but difficult film to understand.,7,23 August 2005,"Bernardo Bertolucci, the Oscar-winning director of The Last Emperor and who also helmed the controversial Last Tango In Paris, doesn't do his best work here but this film is certainly a lot better than the usual stuff churned out by Hollywood.Michael Pitt plays Matthew, an American who is escaping the Vietnam War by going to school in Paris. He is in love with cinema; he spends all his free time going to movie houses watching the most daring work of avant-garde film makers in art houses. One day, there is a protest outside a government building and he meets a woman named Isabelle (Eva Green). He gets friendly with the bilingual Isabelle as her mother is British and father is French. Later, he meets her brother Theo (Louis Garrel). All three happen to share a very serious passion for films and a perfect fit as friends. Matthew lives in a small apartment and is offered the chance to live with the siblings as their parents are taking a vacation.Before the parents leave, Matthew sees that these siblings are unlike any he's seen before. He notices them sleeping together in the same bed naked and that they shower together. He also learns that they love to re-enact scenes from their favorite movies for kicks and he is pretty much egged on to join them in fear of them turning on him. However, he also notices that they play explicit games of dare that involve humiliation when someone fails to guess the movie scene being acted out. At one point, Matthew loses a game of dare and is forced to have sex with Isabelle and that's where the three of them start spending a week of debauchery while the 1968 French Student Riots rage on.The movie shows people who use cinema as a means of escape; a place where they can get away from the realities of life. They re-enact their favorite moments from films to be able to fulfill their fantasies as they get off on it. However, they are left ill-equipped to understand the nuances of the real world and are forced to live in isolation.The movie is pretty good in the first half but it slows to a crawl in the second and becomes very convoluted and excessive. Still, the acting is very good with Pitt, Green, and Garrel delivering good performances. I would be remiss if I didn't say that Green looks beautiful; her mother is Marlene Joubert and her sexiness was passed down very well apparently. You've got to love that scene where she is hand-cuffed to the building and asks Matthew to remove her cigarette from her lips. When he does, she lets out a cute little yelp as if it hurt her. Priceless.This film isn't for everyone but it is a good change of pace from the usual. You might need to see it a few times to fully understand it, though.",The Dreamers
49,braddugg,One of the sexiest films that pays tribute to films and film buffs.,8,8 September 2014,"One of the sexiest films that pays tribute to films and film buffs.Aficionados is a rather nice term of a buff as I learnt through movie many years ago. Firstly, thanks to my friend Raghuveer who let me know of this film and since that happened nearly 5 years ago, I watched it multiple times. When I revisited this film yesterday, I loved the whole of it again. A film buff (Mathew) in Paris meets friends, a brother (Theo) and a sister (Isabelle) and they talk films, make out and face reality.It's a movie that makes a comment on how different is life from movies, we just can't be dreaming for a better world, dreaming about movies, living movies. Reality is a choice while in movies, the actors have choice. The last scene is all about that is what I believe.Set in 1968 and mostly shot indoors, the art direction is good nevertheless and the cinematography sets the mood perfectly. Camera takes it's time for making us settle to the characters which are idiosyncratic and Matthew seems to be trying in touch with reality while Isabelle (Eva Green) claims herself to be purist and thus, does not even watch TV. Theo is another film buff and he is an introvert as it seems, he rarely gets out and is stuck with his sister most of the time. The music plays it's part in bringing the sound of 1968 alive, and though this si set in Paris, we hear to English songs more than the French. Now, on the whole this movie seems to be actually more about the sexual tension between the three characters than about their passion for films, as I figured out. It can also be termed as incestuous as brother and sister have fun too. There are lot many scenes, not one that point out their tension and what they desire from each other, yes there are scenes about their favourite movies, like who is good, Keaton or Chaplin and glimpses of few very old good movies, even French movies and about Truffaut too, but all are just leads to what happens between the three. Surprisingly, when their parents find out that the three have 'made out' they stick to silence and that surprised me each time I saw this and has now made me realise that it's the best thing they can do.All in all, it's a great film by Bernardo Bertolucci and a 4/5 would be apt for the sexiest tribute to films, just wish it was more about films than sex.",The Dreamers

The main characters are a young American student who has come to France to study film... and a very unconventional brother and sister who recruit him to their offbeat lifestyle. All three are obsessed by film (as many young people were in 1968... the glory days of the avant garde)... and also with the concept of breaking rules and societal taboos. With their parents away for the month and the flat to themselves, bets are made on film trivia and the penalties for not identifying a particular moment from a particular film become more and more shocking. Only leaving their home to watch films, the trio are basically oblivious to the growing trouble in the streets... until finally they can sit passively no more. Very intriguing concept and the acting is fine... but ultimately I thought the conclusion fell a little flat... the transition from sexual hedonism to political activism didn't really work for me... it all seemed a little abrupt and could have been explored a little deeper.

51,alainenglish,Eva Green shines in a wasted opportunity,7,30 April 2007,"Watching Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers"", I thought it had something in common with another movie I'd seen earlier this year: ""Three"", starring Kelly Brook. Although stylistically, the two movies are poles apart, they do have one thing in common: they are both showcases for a glamorous female star dressed up as proper movies.There is a political backdrop to this story, about the student riots in France 1968 but this is largely pushed aside. The characters involvement in it bookends the film at the beginning and brings the story to a logical if not altogether effective ending.The story concerns Matthew (Michael Pitt), an American exchange student on a placement in France. He meets two siblings Theo (Louis Garrell) and his entrancing sister Isabelle (Eva Green) who share his love of classic movies and invite him to stay at their apartment while their parents are away on vacation. Completely smitten by Isabelle, Matthew is increasingly drawn into the pair's illicit, incestuous private world where film trivia quizzes descend into sexual and psychological mind games...Without doubt the film's star is future Bond girl Eva Green. Anyone who liked her in ""Casino Royale"" will absolutely love watching her here. It is not for nothing that Bertolucci has described her as ""so beautiful it's indecent"". I've compared this film to ""Three"", but unlike Kelly Brook, Eva Green can act. Her best scene is a short sequence on the streets of Paris with Matthew. Her expressive deep blue eyes convey the tragedy of her character: she's drawn to this idealistic young man, but she's hopelessly bound to her brother, a union that will eventually be the undoing of her.I wish Bertolucci had featured more scenes like this and pared down the often painfully (and I do mean PAINFULLY) explicit sex scenes. He could have tied the central story better in with it's backdrop and significantly broadened the audience. There's nothing wrong with nudity in a good movie if it is used well, but overdosing on it the way Bertolucci has here makes the effect anodyne, and turns the film into little more than slick-looking pornography.Eva Green is a bewitching actress, but with a complex political background that simply isn't drawn on enough, I came away feeling that the movie was a wasted opportunity.",The Dreamers

Very memorable.In fact, this film is full of very memorable scenes. And when I say that, I do not even think about incest scenes. One of them is when they find a photo under his penis! Oh my god ... that was ...something! I read FAQ here where they say that the role of Mathew was intended for Leonardo Di Caprio. I don't think that I would be ready to see Leo's penis up close and personal like this ! Hahaha.Must say that 'the French touch' to this film was great. All three main roles were really convincing.

This film is a prime example. Innocence corrupted? No way. In spite of Pitt's wide blue eyes and bee-stung lips, his character is probably more corrupt from the beginning than that of either of his friends, given that he takes advantage of them relentlessly and plays into their weaknesses with relish.As I have not read the novel on which the film is based, I can only guess something vital that might have redeemed the film version is missing. Nothing seems fully developed or believable. Rien de rien. Perhaps ""dreaming"" is mere nostalgia on the part of the film's creators for all those things they wish they had done, or done better, in 1968. I can certainly identify with that.Incidentally, I viewed a cut that was definitely ""NC-17"" and found its sexual bits as pandering and dull as those in ""Tango.""

Matthew (Michael Pitt, Hedwig and the Angry Inch), an expatriate American student, bonds with a twin brother and sister, Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel), over their mutual love of film--they not only quote lines of dialog, they act out small bits and challenge each other to name the cinematic source. Matthew suspects the twins of incest, but that doesn't stop him from falling into his own intimacies with Isabelle. As the threesome becomes threatened, Paris succumbs to student riots. The Dreamers aspires to be kinky, but the results are more decorative than decadent; nonetheless, the movie's lively energy recalls the careless and vital exuberance of Godard and Truffaut.",The Dreamers
55,tccandler,CINEMA SEX MUSIC POLITICS PHILOSOPHY,10,16 July 2004,"""Le Français... C'est la langue du cinema!"" - Bernardo BertolucciIn the Parisian Spring of 1968, protest and and political unrest was in the air. The same was true in many parts of the world at that time, but Paris was very much the center of change... politically, culturally, artistically and sexually. Bernardo Bertolucci vividly recreates this time and place in his latest film, an erotic, sensual and hedonistic dream immersed in the heart of this revolution. 'The Dreamers' is a gorgeous film about three idealistic young students who while away the hours and days in their vast Parisian apartment talking about love and sex, war and politics, morality and films. And just outside their windows the world is changing.Matthew (Michael Pitt) is quiet, bordering on shy. He is a polite and unassuming nineteen year-old American studying in Paris who spends most of his time at the Cinémathèque Française, which was the center of artistic passion at the time. The devoted patrons of the cinémathèque were cinephiles of the highest order and were utterly devoted to their favorite films and directors. He makes friends with Théo and Isabelle, ""some real Parisians"" as he tells his Mother on the phone. Théo (Louis Garrel) is an elegant rebel who feels passionately about almost everything. He doesn't get along with his father but still accepts monthly checks from him to support himself. His twin sister Isabelle (Eva Green) is a romantic idealist and an intellectual, overflowing with cinematic drama, as when she mimics Greta Garbo in 'Queen Christina'.The three of them stimulate and inspire one another. Théo broods about everything and challenges Matthew on various topics. They get into heated debates about Chaplin versus Keaton, Clapton versus Hendrix, and war versus pacifism. Matthew is a pacifist who truly believes his mind is more powerful than his fists. He is more accepting of turmoil than Théo, who feels a more urgent need to be noticed and heard.Isabelle is a sensualist... Wanting to touch, taste and feel everything she can, sometimes all at once. Her sensual inhibitions lead her and her brother into very unusual territory. They sleep in the same bed every night. They kiss each other softly, the way lovers do. It is as if they've known only each other before they met Matthew. And they are oblivious to the oddity of the nature of their relationship.In one early scene, we discover that Isabelle and Théo challenge each other in a little cinematic trivia game where one has to pay the ""forfeit"" if the answer is not provided. When Théo misses a question, Isabelle makes him masturbate in front of her and Matthew. A while later, they involve Matthew in their games, and when he is unable to deliver the correct response, they order him to make love to Isabelle. Their group dynamic is fascinating, if somewhat bizarre.To some degree, these three characters are living in a dream world while holed up in their apartment. But the inevitable intrusion of the outside turmoil always lingers. And in one scene, late in the film, that intrusion is a shocking wake-up call to both them and us. And in a very real way, that outside turmoil saves their lives. The reality of their situation overpowers the romanticism and they are forced to grow up and confront the real issues of the world.At first, one suspects that these three friends will face the world together. However, it is the differences between Matthew and Théo that lead to the destruction of their threesome. And it is only then that we see Isabelle's loyalty was never really in question at all.Perhaps it all sounds rather cryptic. But that is the nature of Bertolucci's work... Maybe that is true of all great directors. There are always layers peeling away to reveal new layers.Bertolucci's direction is masterful. He is able to tell a very basic story of three friends being sexually playful and intertwine it with questions of morality and political intrigue. He weaves in some lovely references to classic films, some overt and some very subtle. There is a lovely scene where the three of them race through The Louvre in exactly the same way as was done in Jean-Luc Godard's 'Bande à part'. He intercuts his film with footage from Godard's classic. He does the same when Isabelle mimics Garbo. He also gives subtle nods to 'The Third Man', 'Breathless', 'Mouchette' and 'Blonde Venus'. I also love the inclusion of footage from Chaplin's 'City Lights' as they debate Chaplin and Keaton.There is one truly magnificent scene in 'The Dreamers' that I must make special note of. Our three main characters are all squeezed into a bathtub, soaking away, as they debate the merits of war versus the consequences of going to jail for desertion. As their debate fizzles, Bertolucci uses a tri-fold mirror to capture all three faces in a way that would be logistically impossible otherwise. Many directors have used mirrors to great effect throughout the history of film-making, but this was brilliantly original. The scene continues as they all doze off into a lazy deep sleep.The performances are delicate and finely tuned. Michael Pitt, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Leonardo di Caprio, balances his role carefully between wide-eyed naiveté and intellectual pretension. In essence, he plays the blank slate for the two engines of the story, Theo and Isabelle. It is a breakthrough role that will hopefully lead to more great choices. Louis Garrel delivers a nice turn but seems to be overshadowed a little. The screenplay never really requires him to break out of his shell. Perhaps his role is slightly underwritten.The standout is Eva Green. She announces herself as a new star with this brave role. It is a brilliant performance that requires her to bear more than just her naked body for the bulk of the running time. One gets the feeling she was rubbed emotionally raw by this film. Her character is the type who feels deeper, loves deeper and hurts deeper than the others. If she chooses, Eva Green will be a huge star over the next decade or two.This glorious film is definitely intended for cinephiles. It is for all those who are often labeled pretentious by the hoards of average moviegoers who only seem to describe movies in two ways, 'kicks ass' or 'sucks'. 'The Dreamers' is intellectually stimulating, artistically intriguing, politically relevant, sexually charged and subtly profound. I recommend it strictly for those who already know the way to the local art-house theatre without having to look up directions on the internet.Unfortunately, this type of film doesn't merit must-see viewing for most moviegoers anymore. But it is the type of film that would have had ticket lines around the block in the streets of Paris in 1968. Times have changed and more people are eager to see 'Matrix' sequels these days. It's kind of sad really. But there are still a few million of us in this world who are eager for this more weighty material. It's just that we aren't as likely to run into someone else who is willing to discuss it with us.'The Dreamers' is not a film designed strictly for entertainment, although there is a lot of fun to be had. More than anything though, it leaves me steeped in thought about so many things and it has me wistful and nostalgic for a time when this type of film was more the talk-of-town than the latest CGI action-fest or teen-queen high-school fairytale. 'The Dreamers' represents real cinema.",The Dreamers

57,grahamclarke,Bertolucci declares bankruptcy,1,25 September 2006,"It's often the case that directors who in their youth created memorable films loose their touch with the passing years. Sometimes they become casualties of the expectation generated by their reputations; a case in point the fiasco of Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Others creative juices have sadly run dry as with Woody Allen shamelessly reprising his shtick (""Anything Else""), without realizing just how irrelevant and out of touch he has become in his depiction of a young generation of which he clearly has little understanding.It's been a while since Berltolucci has made anything with any real impact. Longing for the fame and notoriety that came with ""Last Tango"" he chooses to return to Paris and to prove just how daring he still is in dealing with sexual taboos and on screen teenage nudity. It's genuinely pathetic. He is an artist gone bankrupt.Bertolucci was once capable of creating complex and compelling movies such as ""The Conformist"" and intense melodramas (""La Luna"" - my personal favorite). It's inconceivable that he could turn out a film so completely bogus. There is not one frame that rings true. The screenplay is filled with the most appalling lines. It would take three far better young actors to make any sense of this garbage. That Michael Pitt almost gets by is in itself a miracle. Louis Garrell and Eva Green are totally inept. But the fault is hardly theirs.So much is wrong with ""The Dreamers"" that one hardly knows where to begin. The ridiculously spruced up Parisian streets look more like MGM back lot and even the costumes look silly. As far as characterization goes, well it simply non existent. There's not much acting either, just endless posturing.There is something very disturbing in the on screen nudity of the three young actors. The question of nudity or on screen sex is totally dependant on context. While a film like ""Ken Park"" is no example of fine cinema, one cannot argue that the sex and nudity is out of context. In the context of this non story peopled with non characters; watching the nudity one feels tainted in being coerced to participate in a dirty old man type of voyeurism.There is no redeeming feature to ""The Dreamers"". It's like the very first effort of an inexperienced young, ambitious and most definitely untalented director.A stinker if there ever was one.",The Dreamers

59,bbhlthph,A reverie about the realities of life,8,2 August 2010,"If, like me, you have reached the age when you need assistance in understanding how today's young people behave, watching a North American movie production may help you. However if you want to understand not only how they behave but also why, what they are really thinking, and how they regard today's world, then you may get more help from one of the better European or Asiatic films, and ""The Dreamers"" might provide a very good starting point. If you recognise any need to become more aware of the factors contributing to the evolution of the society of the future you have few other options, but you might also be helping to reduce the generation gap and its associated stresses that have led to much recent street violence. My generation has no obligation to accept the judgements or wishes of a younger generation, but it has a real responsibility to at least understand them; young people today are very ready to discuss and defend their beliefs and this needs to be encouraged.My apologies - I am writing a review - not preaching. Films like ""The Dreamers"" are less common in North America than in Europe and therefore tend to finish up more controversial here where far too much attention has been paid to the sexuality in the film. Not this but the more appropriate thoughts above came to my mind when I started commenting on it for IMDb. This film nominally follows the inter-relationship between three young people with an intense love for the cinema, an American student in Paris at the time of the 1968 student inspired street riots and French twins of a similar age. But this only provides a background against which its director Bernardo Bertolucci used the individual frames and sequences to build our appreciation of both the intensity and the shallowness of the beliefs that motivate his principal characters. It is easier to follow this film if one is a movie fan - flashbacks from classic films called to mind by one of the characters are used to set moods or changes of emotion. Street activities and even their layout or architecture are built into the fabric of the film. It would take many viewings before a critic could develop a full understanding of the message the director is trying to convey. Quite correctly this was an NC17 film in the US and Canada, much of its imagery would merely be confusing or disturbing to anyone younger, apart from this its very frank portrayal of the sexual interactions between the characters has also proved disturbing to many adult viewers. It is certainly not a film with universal appeal, although it is extremely rewarding for those viewers open to its attempts to probe the generation gap. Isabelle and Theo, the French twins, initially appear to their very conventional American friend Matthew to be modern radicals in full tune with the many concerns about society that young people were feeling during this period, and he willingly allows them to induct him into the various causes the rioters were attempting to promote. But gradually as the film runs we see him becoming disillusioned. He starts to appreciate that circumstances have led the twins into an over-close relationship which has begun to dominate their lives, so that despite lip adherence to these various progressive causes they are really becoming addicted to a personal lifestyle that is essentially self destructive. The film's ultimate message is obviously subject to the interpretation of the individual viewer, but in essence Bertolucci very gradually shows the twins as parasitic, they are not producing but are becoming conspicuously greater consumers, and this is clearly intended to be a parallel progression to that of the street rioters who initially have many very genuine concerns, but whose behaviour evolves in a way which makes their protests increasingly ineffectual. There is no future in anarchy as it rejects the very concepts of compromise and working together which provide the only basis for eventual progress.No film attempting to convey such an ambitious message could totally succeed, nor could it hope to appeal to all filmgoers. Anyone planning to view it should at least read some reviews first to prepare them for what to expect, and if it does not sound the type of film they would enjoy they would be wise to stay away. But for those prepared to view it both closely and sympathetically this film can be a very rewarding experience. The credit for this must be shared between the director and the three young principal actors. Theo is played by the son of French director Phillipe Garrel and his background may have made it easier for these three actors to achieve the confidence in Bertolucci which must have been essential during the filming of some of the more intimate sequences; but all three of them have a remarkable maturity and offer us superb performances.The film is based upon an original novel by Gilbert Adair. He also wrote the film-script so it should reflect the intentions of the original work fairly well; but I still want to read the book to assess whether Bertolucci has merely attempted to recreate it as a movie; or if not how far he has gone in re-interpreting it. Meantime my tentative rating for ""The Dreamers"" is 8 stars.",The Dreamers

Matthew (Michael Pitt) is an American student, studying French and going to cinemas to watch old films. At a protest rally he meets the beautiful French girl, Isabelle and her brother Theo. All three immediately become friends and they talk and share their thoughts on cinema and life. Throughout the movie, Matthew becomes suspicious that Theo and Isabelle are carrying out an incestuous affair when he sees them naked in bed together. Things get crazier and crazier as they reenact scenes from movies and Isabelle and Matthew start a sexual relationship. The ménage à trois, already turbulent because of Theo and Isabelle's obsessive and unbreakable relationship, comes to an end when the events of 1960s France finally comes to them, whether they're hidden or not from them.This movie features a lot of explicit nude scenes that should leave a real sensual feeling for the audience, despite the dysfunctional relationships, and a good description in the way certain people view the world.

I was so taken in by the images that I saw on the screen and I just had to see this.  I have only seen The Last Emperor of Bertolucci and always knew of Last Tango in Paris but never had the pleasure to catch it. I managed to get my hands on a copy of The Dreamers and expected great things from it and that's what I feel I got.   Films like these are not always appreciated by your average film buff but they are by your average artistic fan.    Matthew is an American in Paris exploring the depths of movie making and getting to know the French Culture and along the way he meets Theo and Isabelle, two siblings that are different to every brother and sister in the entire world.   Matthew inhabits into the life of Theo and Isabelle and slowly becomes intrigued and scared of what he wants and knows. The more the film goes on the more the story unfolds and become stranger and stranger.  Matthew I find to be a very human character.  He starts off very shy and when meeting people for the first time he does his best not to step out of line so he can fit in but the more you get to know him the more his personality opens and his concerns on how Theo and Isabelle live their with one another.The film is almost perfect in every way and is very mellow to watch.  I couldn't find a flaw throughout the entire film and I found myself wanting to drink wine afterwards.  I didn't though but because of what they show and what they do it makes you curious to try thongs even though drinking wine is not a spontaneous thing to do but I am making an example of it.   Michael Pitt looks more like Leo Dicaprio the more he gets older and in long shots of Matthew you can't tell either apart, but Pitt is an excellent actor and shows that in The Dreamers.  Eva Green is perfect and more perfect.  She has to be one the rarest beauties in films at the moment as she is just so beautiful especially when she is naked.   Louis Garrel is somebody I have never heard of before but will look out for him in the near future as he has the gift to very far especially in French cinema.  The soundtrack makes the film all the more watch able as the likes of Dylan, Joplin, Hendrix and The Doors ring out in the back drop of the movie with even a Michael Pitt's own version of `Hey Joe' in the bath scene.    I wouldn't take much notice of people who dislike The Dreamers.  I think they just can't handle that there must be lot's of nudity and shock value to make a film like this and this is a Bertolucci film and as much as he tries to out do his own movies he has just added to it.

62,Ronin47,Loses steam in the second half (**1/2),6,6 March 2004,"""The Dreamers"", Bernardo Bertolucci's NC-17 rated movie about sex, riots and film in 1968 Paris is a meaningful and worthwhile film. In fact, parts of it are so good that when it loses a lot of steam in the second hour, it hurts.
Matthew (Michael Pitt, from ""Bully"" and ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") is an American student in Paris, a film-lover at a time and place where being one (and seeing films by controversial New Wave directors like Jean-Luc Godard) was actually a political and revolutionary gesture. He meets attractive French twins Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) who are also young and have similar interests. Matthew is staying in a hotel but his new friends Isabelle and Theo invite him to stay in their large house while their parents are away. In this house over the next few weeks, with a student riot brewing in the streets outside, the three of them engage in various sexual games with one another, pushing each other further and further. Matthew is highly put off at first by the creepy, nearly-sexual intimacy between the twins, but at a time in history where ANYTHING outside of the norm feels like a revolutionary gesture, he is swept along, exhilarated by any opportunity to push the boundaries. The first hour of ""The Dreamers"" is excellent. The period detail, soundtrack (including lots of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin), cinematography, acting...all is nearly perfect. So it's a shame when it becomes repetitive and flat for much of the second half. Unlike a lot of reviewers, I don't have any problems with Michael Pitt's performance. I think he portrays the initially blank, impressionable Matthew quite well. The film is pretentious and sometimes slow-going in that second hour, but when it works, it's gripping and damn good. A story of three students, emotionally adrift at a time of swift social change, eagerly pushing cultural and sexual boundaries but perhaps unprepared for the consequences, this is not a story you get at the movies very often. One thing is for sure, it's for adults only. The NC-17 rating is well-earned, and the sex scenes here will take all but the most mentally prepared art film aficionados quickly out of their comfort zone.It's disappointing in the end, but has enough powerful moments to be well worth taking notice of.",The Dreamers

64,jrfranklin01,Unsure Point,4,19 March 2005,"""Dreamers"" is a film about an American exchange student in France who is caught up in the cinema of the time (1960's). He meets two French siblings who share his knowledge and passion for cinema. They wallow in their decadent and misguided lives while Paris is lashing out at the artistic community.Michael Pitt plays a look-alike Leonardo DiCaprio as the American exchange student (Matthew) in France. His awkwardness seems genuine for his age and feelings of separation as an American in Europe. Eva Green and Louis Garrel play Isabelle and Theo, the two French siblings. Their relationship is something of a disgusting oddity, where incestuous themes float throughout the film. Their openness (sexually, etc.) make be acceptable for the French, but is sure to make any American crawl. In fact, this film pushes the envelope with American audiences in some of the sexual portrayals, especially of Isabelle losing her virginity on a kitchen floor. Amongst the trio's intoxicated conversations, there is some insight and truth to be found, most particularly with Matthew. But his inadequacy keeps him subdued and timid most of the film. The ending is probably the only time at which he appears to take a side or stand up for himself, although it's evident early in the film that his perspective on life is different from majority.I asked myself at the end of the film what the point was. Other than showing the interactions of a bunch of young people in odd scenarios, I was unsure of the purpose. If think it did a good job of making me feel like I was actually witnessing the three main characters' lives. It even took me back at times to how young I once was. But ultimately, the genesis of the film has a stranger meeting two locals, becoming an intimate part of the lives, and then fading back into the crowd to become a stranger again. Their very youth must be what the director was trying to impart with the title. Although, I saw less dreaming and more chaos of a bunch of insecure individuals living on ""apartmental"" island in Paris. 4/10",The Dreamers
65,max von meyerling,Dodging the 68 bullet once again,7,30 January 2004,"Make no mistake, The Dreamers is better than a not bad film. Its pretty OK but still something of a disappointment. The film is supposedly set in Paris in the Spring of 1968 and begins with footage of the battle for the Cinematheque Francaise both original and recreated. Instead of staying in the streets the film retreats to the interior of a grand apartment where the three principals spend most of the following film. It reminds me of the film 1969 (1988) in which while the world around is exploding in crazy ways the principals can only watch from afar as they work out their own personal what used to be called hang-ups.The story concerns a pair of Anglo-French twins and a fresh faced American who moves in with them when the parents go away for a months vacation.There is some strong resemblances to Cocteau's (and Melville's) Les Enfants Terrible (1950). The real disappointment is that once again the cinema has failed to tackle head on the situation of the sixties and the cultural revolution. It is a topic assiduously avoided by mainstream cinema and here, again, merely toyed with by the art cinema.I remember during the summer of '68 Godard sent, with a huge amount of fanfare, a film purporting to be straight from the streets of Paris. It was shown at Lincoln Center and turned out to be one long un-subtitled shot of some students at Nanterre University discussing who knows what. Just to show the audience that he, Godard, knew just what the audience had come for there were occasional flashes of almost subliminal cuts of Parisian Street Action. The audience revolted and someone shut down the film by turning on the lights and causing the screen to ascend to the flies. (The leader of the revolt and stopper of the film was your correspondent.) The theoretical idea might have been that this is what Godard had planned all along- to get people away from the passivity of being an audience and into the streets.Unfortunately most of the audience had already been struggling in the streets of New York and wanted to see what had happened in the streets of Paris. Again, if there are any young people genuinely curious about what it was like in 1968 THE DREAMERS will let them know in only the most oblique way. Cineasts (presumably among the older generations) will enjoy themselves whatever. I still want to see an honest delineation of what it was like in that terrible and wonderful year of 1968. This is just more prevarication and obscuration. Then again if I had found myself in a huge Paris apartment with two young, attractive and willing playmates maybe I would have let the revolution go to hell too.Another great disappointment with the film is the way it get right up close and personal to the subject of bi-sexuality and then criminally, timidly, avoids the whole topic. Apparently it was part of the original story in the book as well as in life. This might be due to commercial considerations, the objection by the management of the star Michael Pitt, or else Bertolucci felt uncomfortable with the parallel which might be drawn with his private life, assumptions caused by drawing attention to his collaborations with his wife Claire Peploe and her brother Mark. Whatever the speculations might be, taking us right up to the edge and not going past was something of an anti-climax. That might be a fitting eulogy for Berolucci's career, so often getting closer to a really important idea than anybody else but then suffering a crisis of either the heart or pocketbook and pulling away leaving the finished product somehow incomplete.

66,anthonyf94,The thin line of reality,8,23 September 2019,"""The dreamers"" shows the days of three guys during '68's revolution in French, lived in a kind of Comune, among sex, wine, music, poetry and political thoughts. The narrative aim is to reflect on the strange equilibrium between two twins with an incestuos relationship and an American boy that live the complicated journey to become part of this group. His presence, and his love with the girl, makes the pathological rapport between Theo and Isabell risk to destroy itself and it is reveals how the ratio of the movie is in this freak triangle and the irrational necessity to not broke it. All the things of the world have to be collocated inside the law of this fictional triangle; so the movie is a collage of mentions of other movies and, or through imitation games or in real cinemas, the scenes are in alternation with other old movie scenes. Finally Matthew becomes really part of this triangle but the final shows silently the falsity of this relationship: the dreamy world isolated from the reality that the guys created is an illusion against the material world made of violence and political fights.
Beyond the undisputable beauty of music, atmospheres and photography, this movie reflects also on the separation from reality and of the maniacal aim of construction an alternative, maybe impossible, world.",The Dreamers
67,andre-71,lyrical story with beautiful actors and a message,8,11 February 2004,"I liked this film a lot. It has a lyrical story explaining the way strange ideas can prosper in a trouble-free upper class society. Part of that is the inclination towards erotic experiments. Particularly those have been portrayed in an amusing way. The latter half of the film was a little weak here and there, but I still give it an 8/10.",The Dreamers
68,commandercool88,"Beautifully exotic, ravishingly artistic.",9,7 July 2008,"'The Dreamers' is a mood, a state of mind. A film so alive with raw sexuality but with a story that pulses with intellect and poetry, director Bernardo Bertolucci has crafted a perfectly thoughtful and compelling work of art. An ambitious project that seeks to balance politics with sex, 'The Dreamers' is wildly successful no matter how off-putting it may seem at first glance.With the politically turbulent landscape of Paris in the 1960s serving as the film's backdrop, 'The Dreamers' transports us to a foreign time and place and immerses us completely in all its beauty and rage. It slowly lures us into its grip of maze-like hallways and incestuous relationships, and it's difficult not to watch in complete awe. An intoxicating and lush piece of film-making that hides nothing from its audience.Michael Pitt, Louis Garrel, and Eva Green bare themselves to the camera, vulnerable as they evolve and transform before our eyes. The material may seem wildly inappropriate, and to an extent it is, but Bertolucci has found a way to combine these many elements in a way that's sheer wonderment. A glimpse into a past that many of us never experienced, 'The Dreamers' gives us a lot to think to think about, not to mention a lot to look at. Take it in, experience it. This is a masterpiece for the senses.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",The Dreamers
69,bbbl67,what a train-wreck!,5,25 September 2004,"Oh my god, what self-indulgent tripe! The director is just basically listing his favourite movies and trying to recreate scenes from them here. That's the basis for this entire movie, but that can never be a basis for a movie! In order to keep the interest level in the movie up, he just throws in some nude/sex scenes and some random rioting for the violence.The movie may have been set against the backdrop of the 1968 Paris riots, but what have those riots got to do with the rest of this movie?There's a scene in there where Matthew explains how film directing is like watching a train-wreck. Such an apt description of this very film.Give it a pass, this film has nothing interesting to say. It just thinks it does.",The Dreamers
70,Daniel Karlsson,Godard and Hollywood,7,10 February 2004,"Well crafted. The movie connections are a delight for movie lovers, especially fans of the French New Wave, such as myself. What I most dislike with the film is the American boy. Seen in many Hollywood films all the way back to Capra's days, focus is on a very shy (especially for his age, if he would be in his early teens I would find it more plausible) and insecure boy over 20 years of age, satisfied with his state of life - undesperate despite the fact that he has no friends, with a golden heart - the angel of good moral himself who has the right answers for everything, and then comes this beautiful girl and falls in love with him (the girl taking initiative and leading him all the steps to sex of course - well doesn't happen every day, I doubt it ever happens in real life), suddenly everyone starts to like him and he's a 'winner' in the end. Sort of a 'the kind nerd wins'. I just can't buy that anymore. But ok; this isn't a typical 'kind nerd wins' movie, but the those annoying elements were obvious, from the initial beginning to the end, when Matthew speaks about that they should ""fight with brains - not guns"".Otherwise, we have a few pretty beautiful scenes photoed with colorful and sharp film, and the text intro and the last scene, that fades to black and white during Piaff's song (which fitted extremely well there), stand out. Apart from that the cinematography doesn't impress too much. The sound fits well. Garrel managed to satisfy my view of a typical Paris-1960 young man, frequently smoking. Could have been without the incest, made the movie aim for a little too much perhaps, although the combination of two men and a girl was successful. Eva Green was pretty good as well, I particularly liked her imitation from the Dietrich film. Also the Louvre-race is a treat.I feel that Bertolucci missed something about Godard's highly intellectualism. This film is definitely on a lower level than Godard's films, regardless of epoque in his life. Very little classical music, art, quotes, philosophical material, poems...but on the other hand I guess that's not the intention of the film. The script is ok but not by any means impressive. A caleidoscope and nice treat for film buffs rather than a perfectly-framed masterpiece. Hopefully, it might also help introducing the New Wave to the modern audience.7",The Dreamers
71,eklavya-cwk,Whats the POINT of 'something different' !,1,2 February 2015,"The Dreamers, a name to signify that the dreams are different from reality. Agreed well and also that this movie is cohesive cozy and captive film making (for....). But I wonder the need.The movie is a complete alternative of p*rn but still the director has descended it in the mainstream cinema. Well and good for the crew. Now many prestigious critics and portals praised the film for its great cinematic and directorial technicality, which anyone can do if he understand the technicality. But the thought that captures me is what was the point of making something different.Whenever one wishes to say 'hello' he will usually wave his hand or shake but what if he says 'hello' with one hand over 'his @' and other hand making a puppet face of any animal like a Deer. The thing is why wasn't some other alternative script chosen as a theme for the actual moral. This film depicts extremely filthy sections of a dirty mind which I think has lost its creativity. Whenever something different is to be done, being a responsible artist, it should be done in such a way that it can elevate the mental virtues and ideas of the viewer rather than just hypnotizing him in fantasy of life and logics too.Can't judge the film myself, didn't appreciate the movie at all, but just wonder. This film is a or may be a fine example that how Wasted(Demon) things can have Useful(Blinding) effect on the Brain(an Artificial Stuff) which can justify anything which it enjoys.",The Dreamers
72,alexandermangoldt,Nice ideas but tedious in the end,7,17 February 2006,"I very much liked the scenes in which the three protagonists copy famous scenes of film history. I really thought that this had something to it and I really believe that Bertolucci loves the cinema. Like the way one of his film characters explains the Charlie Chaplin scene, in which the former blind girl touches Chaplins face for the first time and makes the audience see Chaplins face for the first time as well. That I liked. But the story itself about the incestuous siblings and their American friend was rather flawed. I really think that directors make it too easy for themselves when thinking that a good film requires nothing more than a few nude scenes, a few tits and a young boys dick to make it interesting. After half an hour or so I knew that this was a dangerous ménage à trois but then the story just went on in those lines and developed nothing new or extraordinary. It just went on and on with little sex games, conversations becoming more and more uninteresting and a somewhat faked fatality. As to the parents of the siblings: I think that they are an accurate image of the 69 parent generation. How they just let their kids be and don't interfere with their lives at all. How they think that it is a good way of educating kids and don't realize that their kids are led astray. That was good. It makes books like Houellebcqs Particules elementaires comprehensible.",The Dreamers
73,ks4,Poetically brave and challenging.,8,13 May 2004,"Matthew is a young american student in france, his passion for movies leads him into Theo and Isabelle, two twins that shares his passion, they quickly build a deep friendship and Matthew gets invited to stay with them while their parents are gone. However once he gets settled with them he discovers sides of both that he had not expected. While they spend their time talking and playing, the riots of Paris 1968 goes on in the ""real world"".This is a very brave film in the way it has been build, but it is also a complicated movie that will leave you both confused and thinking, it's beautiful and it can almost be described as cinematic poetry, however this poetry also makes it a difficult one to relate too.After seeing this film i am confused in what i feel about it, the movie feels very divided, and some times it is an extraordinary brave and experimental film, other times it is confuing, and at some times boring too. It's really a hard movie to understand because of the poetic feeling it gives, it's like reading a poem where some of the lines doesn't make sense, but i guess that could be an advantage as it can be seen more than once. I feel the strength of the movie is the way it challenges and explores like no american or typical mainstream movie would do, the often use of nudity and raw sex scenes would never be seen elsewhere, and even though it may annoy many people, Bertolucci portrays the scenes very beautiful and they never seem like dirty scenes, the most impressive scene is the one where Matthew and Isabelle have sex, never have a full sex scene been portrayed in such a beautiful and realistic way on screen. And there are many examples of this.What brings the movie is first of all the very slow storyline, it barely moves at all, the whole 2 hours are pretty much circulating around one thing, which is the way these 3 youngsters spend their sparetime, it's an mysterious movie that really brings up interesting situations a lot of times, but other times it simply gets too slow and gets a little boring. Another partly negative thing is the understanding of the movie, as I earlier mentioned the movie is like a poem, if you have problems with a few lines the whole deeper meaning may fall apart. I wouldn't say i did not understand the fully deeper meaning of the movie, but i think each individual will understand this movie differently, due to the complex way it has been made. But i honestly think Bertolucci wanted it to be like that, a movie that will leave you thinking about many things, but i think what it really is about is finding yourself in a world where there are 6 billion people looking like you on the outside.The movie is very well directed, a solid directing and you can clearly see the trademarks of the director, one thing i noticed was the floating camera. The floating camera gives a feeling of being there, it is mostly used in the first part of the movie where Matthew learns more about his mysterious new friends, it gives us a feeling of curiousity towards these two new persons. Two persons whom we soon discover have more to them than showing on the outside.The acting in the movie is solid. I usually don't expect much from new and coming actors and actresses that i have not heard about before, this was also the case for this movie. But the acting is really good, Michael Pitt and Louis Garrel really gives an above average performance, great to see that there are still new actors who can take over when the old ones will be gone. But the star of this movie is Eva Green, what a mysteriously and unique performance, and what a brilliant casting, she is unique, beautiful and most importantly interesting, erotic and challenging. Also i give props to all the three main characters for their brave and realistic portray of nudity and the complications of sex among unexperienced youngsters.As i said earlier this movie is very complex, it's hard to understand, and i could probably talk about it forever, but i got to stop somewhere. I think the movie is definetely worth watching, it's very artistic and does indeed stand on its own feet, it takes chances you don't see many movies take, and it's all done very well. On the negative side i think the movie sometimes get too complex and slow, but overall i don't regret seeing it, and i think that i will be seeing it again due to the complex story, it will probably bring me new thoughts when i see it next time.6/10",The Dreamers

I watched in disgust as most of this ""movie"" unfolded, waiting for the story to take some kind of dramatic turn at least...since the audience is being subjected to so much sickness, I thought the film-maker at least ought to compensate and make it a satisfying movie-viewing experience. But NO! I was in for a disappointment. The movie has absolutely NOTHING to offer. It is just a collection of some of the most disgusting scenes/ideas that you can ever imagine(or perhaps cannot).A sister watching her brother jack off, in a masturbation scene that takes painfully long to end? The brother watching his sister being f.u.c.k.e.d. by their American friend...and later touching where it bled?? Or how about that scene where the brother goes downstairs to get some food from the garbage and they actually eat some of it!! And to what conclusion? Zilch! Even the political movement (or its influence) is almost negligible. What is shown is only the three central characters' love for cinema and their so-called ""sexual awakening"". Gosh...gimme a break!! OK..I must admit that Eva Green looks great..she is perhaps the only thing watchable in this tripe! Not that incest is something I've seen in films for the first time...but there are other stories/films which have shown it or handled it in a much better manner than this worthless piece of s***.

That was a time of change in which culture was still strong enough to get people out to the streets to demonstrate. Beyond all this, Bertolucci focuses on how young people are discovering each other, with a capacity of wonder, freshness, intelligence, ingenuity, sensuality that adults usually do not have.  The movie has that unmistakable flavor of the experience of youth which leaves its mark and is never forget.9,5/10",The Dreamers

Brilliant soundtrack but hey it was not written by Bertolucci, just picked by him. And then of course Eva Green's birthday suit splashed all over your screen. Not that it's unpleasant to look at, but it does not turn this pretentious, pedantic film into a good one. Claiming - no less - to change your outlook on life forever, this ultra realistic work focuses on a game of the characters who live for and by cinema, and have the superficial and shallow approach to life that two characters, the father and the son also share... happily living a life of luxury where ""a poem is a petition and a petition is a poem"" while keeping away from the riots of 68 and indulging in pleasures that in themselves are in contradiction with the views they have on life and politics.

Here, the experienced cinematographer not only summarizes many movies that marked the birth of modern cinema, as well as maneuvers a contrast between the tensions of that decade and the journey of intimate discovery by three young persons, stirred by the events of their time. Highlights for the leading trio, that skilfully dominate the 'spicy' moments, but specially Eva Green, embodying a dissimilar 'femme fatale'.An outstanding movie with wide cinematographic influences and references, that are in a certain way, a bit of what Bernardo Bertolucci is as a film-maker.",The Dreamers
81,el_nickster,La grande bombe de puanteur.,3,31 March 2005,"Translation: big stinkbomb.This movie is best described as pseudo-intellectual and pseudo-erotic crapola. Set in Paris in 1968, it is the story of an American exchange student who gets into a love affair with an eccentric brother and sister at the time of the Free Speech Riots. Although the main characters are all supposed to be passionate film buffs, ""The Dreamers"" gives no hint of the kind of intellectual or artistic movement that was behind the unrest of 1968. This is really just an incongruous backdrop. The main characters like to recite movie lines and ask each other trivia questions, but that is the extent of what we learn about their passion for film. So, that is the pseudo-intellectual part.When I say pseudo-erotic, I guess it is a matter of opinion. The French brother and sister have an incestuous love going on that is the movie's real focus. If incest is an exciting concept to you, then this film may strike you as highly erotic. The starlet is naked throughout the entire film, too, and that's erotic to most people who are into girls. However, for me it went no farther than any old ""skin flick."" To sum it up, ""The Dreamers"" is like a bad imitation of ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"": an attempt to make the same kind of sexy love story set in the backdrop of political unrest.

82,PenOutOfTime,What 'The Dreamers' is about,6,28 August 2007,"'The Dreamers' is a film that may easily be misunderstood, because while the human interaction and dialog that composes the plot of the story is amazingly 'natural' in the sense that one word or action flows from another, it is not self-evident why the story itself is told, nor is it clear what it means.The trick to understanding 'The Dreamers' is to understand that the characters, students in 1968 Paris, are intended to represent the whole class and generation of French students of the day. 'The Dreamers' is a rather critical assessment of the French students of that era, and of their political efforts.One does not expect so controversial a film with so much edgy content to have such a conservative heart, but the erotic and edgy content in 'The Dreamers' is like a piece of exotic lingerie, designed to titillate, but ultimately fated to be draped on a very prosaic bourgeois frame. While the film does not condemn its characters for transgressing (a term much favored by the director Bernardo Bertolucci) the behavioral standards of society, it dismisses the broadly revolutionary activity of 1968 as immature and ultimately dangerous, and dismisses the events of 1968 as only being useful as a youthful transgressive excursion; ""sowing your wild oats"" in effect.All this leaves three basic problems with this film. First, even the liberally minded may well be disgusted by the moral tone of the film. Second, the film cannot be fully understood without extensive knowledge of the events of 1968, and for so important an event, France 1968 is obscure. Many, although not all, people will find the film to be lacking in purpose without understanding the underlying meaning. Third, if you do understand the film, and understand the events of 1968, there is an excellent chance that you will not favor this particular interpretation of the era, generation, or movement.On the other hand, there is no question but that 'The Dreamers' is a masterful piece of film-making, skillfully shot, with astounding direction and acting. While an amazing amount of dialog and activity is sly commentary on the revolutionaries of the day, such subtle propaganda is enough to make one question the forceful and bombastic tone of more commercial and mainstream films, and the criticism is subtle enough that it is not disruptive.This is certainly a complex film to evaluate, but I can give some advice on how, or whether to watch it. This is a film that will appeal to film-buffs more than it will appeal to a general audience (indeed it is ABOUT film buffs, and contains many tribute scenes). Anyone who would be disturbed by the controversial moral tone for which this film is famous, should be advised that the sophisticated nature of the film does not obliterate the matter.If you do wish to see this film, the DVD version of the film has special features that contain useful background information that helps to explain the film, although in keeping with the French ""New Wave"" film movement, the background information does not force this meaning explicitly upon you.",The Dreamers

It's a sophisticate's film about the dangers of self-indulgence and the disassociations (from reality) that can happen when these things go too far. It's certainly not a film for everyone, with plenty of graphic sex and nudity to steer away the average moviegoer (especially in America), but it certainly grabs the viewer's attention and never lets go until the very end. One has to hand it to the actors for taken on such a bold and often taboo story and characters.The film is a cinema lover's dessert. It's filled with references to the French New Wave, and clips and homages to old Hollywood song and dance pictures. I'm glad it took me this long to see it, otherwise I would have never recognized these references, as I just recently started exploring French New Wave cinema within the past couple of years.""The Dreamers"" is also a film about what is hip and cool, and how such personifications often contradict or become a shallow shell of what was originally intended. However, this is also a small problem I had with the film overall. It never seemed to be quite sure of what it was trying to say or do (as were the characters, I suppose).

Bernardo Bertolucci sets up this sort of tribute to the French cinema that composed their New Wave with directors such as Godard or Truffaut or actresses like Anna Karina or Jean Seberg. The thing is Bertolucci din't make neither a movie that would fit in the 60's, neither a movie suiting for the lovers of the Nouvelle Vague. He created this very confused teenagers, probably old enough not to be called teenagers. A couple of twin brothers, Theo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green), carrying a very strange relationship, touching delicate sexual issues and sharing a huge love for contemporary cinema with an American studying french in Paris, Matthew (Michael Pitt). It's quite possible that Bertolucci used this two sides to oppose our present to theirs (the 60's), Matthew representing our paradigm, rational, cool and defensive, against the brothers, creative, singular and passionate. The movie then goes on describing a week or two following the moment they met each other while the brother's parents go on vacation leaving the house for their non sense. Non sense that kind of reminds you of Godard, mixed with the loose but hollow commentaries.

Don't know why anyone had trouble with the actors, they seemed quite real (as my memory of that era serves), with Michael Pitt reminding me, quite vividly, of an old acquaintance or two. 
Even the suggestion of incest is off-putting, but this is the storyline. The nudity was refreshing, hey this was the late 60's and among a pretty wild trio.  Even movies of that period was very frank in their use of nudity, e.g. the terrific Women in Love. The movie remembrance scenes were a highlight for me, ""Queen Christina"" especially welcome.  POSSIBLE SPOILER!! Pulling this down to a 9 (still a mighty fine evaluation): the frank use of nudity for the sister, but only a small dose for the men.  And come on, the missing element, although highly suggested, was the lack of any real sensuality between the two men (although you can almost feel the desire between the guys, but Bertolucci, of all people!, chickened-out).For a limited audience who will likely enjoy the warm, wacky, wondrous nostalgia.

The story revolves around the inability of Theo and Isabelle to break away from their incestuous relationship, excused by, they say, the fact that they were conjoined twins. You are left asking whether they are, Bertolucci continuously alludes to the matching marks on their upper arms, or to the fact that they do not appear to be. Theo and Isabelle are truelly dislikable, vain and self-obsessed, and as Matthew is increasingly drawn into their world you pity him for his inability to stand up against their pompous self-importance instilled in them by their parents liberal intellectualism. Including the clips of movies is as much for the name-that-movie parlour game addicts as is including the sixties sound track, but they do strengthen the direction the movie follows as all three characters main point of reference is movie history. Excellent little vignettes concerning such things as who is the greatest clown? Chaplin or Keaton, are included. And Theo's assertion that the Chinese revolution is just like a movie is shot down in flames by Matthew - these soldiers have but one book and seem to be nothing more than extras on a film set. The sex, although fairly strong, is never gratuitous, and is seen more as a way for Isabelle to break free from the relationship she has with her brother. The ersatz revolutionary Theo plays out the revolution in his head while drinking red wine and talking movies. In the end Matthew begins to see him and Isabelle for what they really are, vainglorious do-nothings. When Matthew argues with them that violence is not the way forward as they man the baracades, Isabelle has to choose between the two of them, and chooses her brother, yet you are still left with the feeling that this is merely a badge of honour for the pseudo communists.Whiffs of Band a Part, Les Enfants Terrible, even Repulsion are there. This is a fantastic movie, and all credit to Bertolucci for giving us an insight into the movies and time that made him the director he was and is.",The Dreamers
89,JasonSmithRoberts,quality movie,10,30 July 2021,"'The Dreamers' is Bernardo Bertolucci's bizarre and fascinating (if not altogether successful) distillation of the radical '60's mentality. Since the film is set in Paris in 1968, the radicalism naturally takes the form of perverted sexuality and extreme cinephilia. Leave it to the French to be exploring l'amour in all its myriad possibilities!",The Dreamers
90,KDCarson,At least it had a lot of nudity!!,8,14 June 2009,"***Spoilers*** I sometimes wonder if certain film makers like to drop some poo like this onto a plate, stride boldly out onto the streets holding the platter with both hands, and and politely present it to the world with a wan silly smile saying, ""Hey look I'm a genius!!"" That being said, it's not a terrible movie. It does have the saving grace of nudity and some interesting intellectualism. It's very character driven and goes deep into the psychology of the three young people in the movie. Also some gross out scenes are provided such as the American spitting in his room and the food scene which are supposed to make the story more realistic, (probably should have been left out.) But this is in the neo-realistic style so I guess those scenes had to be in there along with all the other mind candy (or drivel, depending how it strikes you) to tickle (or nauseate) your intellect. Still they tried to make something with a cut above the average in smarts for this film and succeeded on some levels. I gave it an 8 out of 10 (primarily because you get to see so much of the girl.)",The Dreamers
91,btodorov,Les enfants terribles of 1968,8,27 March 2004,"Like all Bertolucci's movies this one too is exquisitely beautiful, though this time the spectator is required to be strongly nudity-tolerant in order to appreciate it. I am not sure, however, whether the message, if message there is, is sufficiently clear. The plot was definitely not a love story, not between Matthew and Isabelle anyway; it was not about decadence either, since even if their behavior was scandalous, neither of the three young people could be accused of depravity or falling into vice, on the contrary, all three of them were progressive and surprisingly innocent in many ways; it was not about overwhelming eroticism since none of the three appeared in any way to have succumbed to the call of the flesh and change his/her way of life; it was not even about ""going beyond"" in a Jim Morrison-ish or Jimi Hendrix-ish way (even if the Doors and Hendrix were mighty present throughout the whole movie). So what was the movie all about? To me the whole story makes sense only in a strictly French context: against the background of the famous book by Jean Cocteau, Les enfants terribles, which ends in a glorious apotheosis of a menage a trois including a brother and a sister, or possibly that of Michel Tournier's Les Meteores discussing the life-long love relationship between twins... In fact, through the mouth of the Californian Matthew who eventually refuses to fall into the inertia of his two friends' self-complacence and self-sufficience, Bertolucci apparently disagrees with Cocteau. But then, possibly in an attempt to make the movie more appealing, and more comprehensible to people who have never read Cocteau, he shifts the emphasis to the conflict between violence (the Parisian twins) and non-violence (the American boy). What do these have to do with the forbidden love between brother and sister? I am obviously missing the point.",The Dreamers
92,returning,A tawdry and wasted experience,4,5 January 2005,"For me, watching this film felt like eating fast food. I was able to feast on the name-drops and felt a kinship with these young cinephiles. But the lack of real substance left me feeling slightly uneasy when it ended.A film about film(s) needs to parallel them in a more clever way than mere imitation. The Isabelle/Mouchette comparison exposes how weak the use of these ""flashbacks"" really are. Mouchette is profoundly human, we rarely see more than her face or her hands. She seeks redemption, has inexplicable outbursts of anger, but also moments of spontaneous compassion. Isabelle is none of these things. But she isn't de-personalised enough to make this an apt antithetical comparison. It's lazy film-making, name-dropping for the sake of name-dropping. The ""Freaks"" reference had the most potential, but they chose not to pursue it.The film could have been saved with a more worthwhile look at the riots and the politics behind them. We get about three lines from Pitt's character before he is shut up by a naked Isabelle and tossed into another ten minute sex scene. This isn't the visceral experience it makes itself out to be, ""Tango"" was a great example of film through sensuality, through distant perception. Not so here.2 out of 5 - Bad outweighs the good",The Dreamers
93,FedRev,Political and sexual awakening and a spirit of revolution,10,15 February 2015,"Set against the backdrop of the 1968 student riots in Paris, The Dreamers is a film of political and sexual awakening during a time when a spirit of revolution was in the air. Matthew is an American exchange student who meets two siblings, Theo and Isabelle, shortly after arriving in Paris. The trio bonds over a shared love for cinema, and the film is laced with numerous references to film classics and the French New Wave, making it in some ways a film about film. But it's also a film about revolution and breaking established social boundaries. Living in a large house while the sibling's parents are away, the three central characters engage in ideological struggle that reflects the social turmoil going on outside. Theo is a Maoist who supports the student's radical demonstrations while Matthew believes their efforts are futile. Simultaneously Matthew and Isabelle develop a sexual relationship that Theo must come to terms with. In the end, the varying ideologies of the characters come to a head and they are each forced to make a choice about the direction of their lives. The film is passionate and alive with a revolutionary spirit, and at the decisive moment, it upholds a radical approach. Michael Pitt, Eva Green, and Louis Garrel each turn in exceptional and brave performances in this film that is directed with subtly and nuance by Bernardo Bertolucci.",The Dreamers

Watchable enough sex/friendship film is most interesting when the characters are talking to each other about movies and politics, or re-enacting movie scenes to be guessed by the others under penalty of some kind of embarrassing punishment, less interesting when it tries to become a character study, as these characters are ultimately as empty as the lives they lead and the political clichés they expound.

95,hamass-mujadid,Looking Yourself in the Mirror,8,14 March 2015,"I had watched The Dreamers a very long time ago, but it was just nude clips on DailyMotion; I never realized that a movie with NC-17 could have any aesthetic potential, so I thought, ""Why bother going through the whole piece?"" Now that I was ahead of the ""hetro erectus"" phase, I watched The Dreamers again, this time whole of it, and I swear, I didn't have any interest in watching those scenes while I was just in the initial stages. This implies that the movie was made for a whole lot of reasons, but nudity was not one of them. Audacity and explicitness might be. The Dreamers dreams high. It talks about world at a small-scale and minuscule level, it talks about the every-day interaction patterns, and what these patterns symbolize. It talks about the cognitive confusions, dilemmas, predicaments, and everything baffling about this world. It talks about how not every individual agrees with the norm, in fact, doesn't even agree to them being norm. Such individuals consider their lives resembling superficiality, and consider themselves agents of it. They associate every move and variation of their life with the one elsewhere. The Dreamers bring such people to reality. I'm an authority because I'm too, on so many levels, exhibiting the same views of myself. The script isn't something that only true movie and media lovers will understand and like. For others, it's just three beautiful people in France talking and doing crap for ninety-something minutes. The Dreamers talks about incest, because for the people it talks about, it is one of the sexual relationships that have gone awry from the main course of socialization; it's not considered a norm, while it should be. Incest is just like any other physical bond. You see, the movie uses sexuality, and nudity as agents of vision, not pleasure, which fags of modern-day drama do. The Dreamers uses ordinary people in ordinary circumstances with extraordinary personalities. These personalities are not the tycoon, magnate ones; they're only commonly uncommon, if that makes any sense. The Dreamers elucidates what's the figment of my imagination (reality while I'm fully submerged into that phase) when I'm listening to Marriage of Figaro or Mozart in general. I'm stuck by the same gust of dreaming and Lego-making when I listen to him, or watch a sentimental movie (not just romance, I mean even Interstellar hit me pretty badly.) The Dreamers provides several links, connections, references, causations and correlations to movies, behave in certain ways reminiscent to those performed in the movies (that's when I started loving Eva Green. Still do.) Eva Green was out of all three, much better in reflecting the theme of the movie. The others just played their part I'd say. Verdict: Don't watch it if you're even a mild-philistine. You'll know if you're because all philistines don't know what philistine means. I know that was patronizing; I'm like that sometimes.",The Dreamers
96,dickback,It's about cinema and it's about sex: my two favourite things ever :-),8,9 March 2005,"Exactly. This movie is about cinema and about sex: how could it possibly be wrong? :-) But yes, I admit I'm too biased to judge it fairly. But the beginning monologue is just captivating: why do you sit in the first row, at the cinema? To catch the images when they are still fresh, and before than the others - oh yeah!Take a horror movie: maybe it's a great film, but hardly ever you'll dream, you wish you were there - right inside the movie. Well, with ""The dreamers"" it could be the opposite: regardless from the quality of the movie, you watch it and just wish you were there - living with those beautiful people, in such a stimulating environment, culturally and politically.In other words, you see ""The Dreamers"" and you start dreaming. Well, of course that does not make of it a great movie, necessarily - but it's a pretty good start, I'd say.Yes, the movie is about love (lust, maybe, sex), but also about getting along well with people who are right for you. Not friends, not necessarily friends, but interesting folk, who maybe won't last forever, but who help you in doing what you like, thinking what you think, going where is good for you. And I'm not saying that the cultural environment and the people depicted in the film are the right ones for everybody, but what I say is that watching this film made me feel I'm missing the right company, the right people around me (I'd say, a sort of cultural loneliness), exactly in the same way of when you see a love story and start dreaming about your soul mate. When Matthew writes to his mother and says ""you'll be happy to know I met the right people"", well, I just envied him. The right people, so rare nowadays.",The Dreamers
97,surenm,A Heterosexual Film Cleverly Disguised as a Bisexual Wet Dream,6,7 February 2004,"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*If you're bisexual or gay and you don't want to be, this anthem of unashamed nudity is the film for you.It is of high interest to me at least that in a world where individuality is praised over all else that such conformist filmmaking still exists to the extremes seen in ""The Dreamers,"" especially for such an art house piece. One cannot discount Bertolucci as a filmmaker, his craft is superb and his technique unsurpassed, but his sexual politics are highly questionable. 
This is probably the closest I have ever seen a film teeter-totter on the edge of having real bisexual characters, yet carefully making sure to never cross into that ""dangerous"" and ""forbidden"" territory.  One could say the same about its incestuous brother / sister couple, for he never ""entered"" her, so technically they didn't really have a sexual relationship, so by this logic they basically weren't really a couple.  And Michael Pitt never really did anything with Louis Garrel so basically they were both straight, except that they liked to be naked a lot and take baths with each other, against the ""hot"" backdrop of the '68 Paris riots.  What kind of message is this film sending?  That it is okay to lie naked and so intimately close to other members of the same sex just as long as you don't touch them in any way that might be considered sexual?  Or that one would go too far by having a brother and sister make out or worse make love on screen?  But implying that they do, except actually they don't, is okay instead? 
This is very confused filmmaking when dealing with sexual politics and it sends mixed signals; a kind of very strange, conservative, and conformist message to the art house scene.  My opinion: if you're going to make a film about a boy that falls in love with a girl and a boy, whether they are brother and sister or not, then make that film.  Don't make a film pretending to be a film about a boy that falls in love with a girl and a boy but only makes out with the girl.  This is a highly pretentious and cold way of treating a potentially beautiful concept.Interestingly, the way the sexuality of the three-way relationship was treated mirrors the way the Paris riots where treated, they were utterly glossed over and unreal, they felt like an overtone to a movie about a hopelessly romantic yet sexually mature heterosexual American boy falling in love with a confused little French girl who just happens to live with her weird heterosexual Siamese twin brother.  And they all love to sleep naked next to each other.  It is unbelievable how a film about love, sex, and the beauty of openness can be so utterly cruel, closed-minded, and conservative. If you like your sex and history the way you like your toast, buttered on one side only, then enjoy this bitter piece of celluloid chocolate.",The Dreamers

99,cs100,All dreamers must eventually wake up,6,10 March 2004,"My rating:  6/10There are two types of dreamers in `The Dreamers':  the three main characters, who create their own interior world and prefer to view the outside world by watching classic 1930s cinema; and the socialist street revolutionaries of riot-torn 1968 Paris, who attempt to overthrow the political and economic power structure.  `The Dreamers' focuses more on the former than the latter, and Bernardo Bertolucci is careful to leave his film open to interpretation, but ultimately the dream world of the three main characters is shattered by the realities of life.  The film ends before resolving the outcome of the second set of dreamers, but we all know our history.  Some may think it a shame that the dreamers fail, but others like myself will view it as something that has to happen, if the dream is unrealistic and unsustainable.The relationship between the three main characters is unlike anything that I've ever seen portrayed on film.  The twins, Isabelle and Theo, are almost as close to each other in young adulthood as they were during the nine months they spent together in their mother's womb.  Matthew, a U.S. student studying abroad in Paris, inserts himself into the middle, and when he receives early indications that portend the depth of the relationship between the twins, he does not run away.  To me, this required too much suspension of disbelief, but I'm certainly aware that others have different proclivities.  If Bertolucci's intent was to show a high degree of separation between his three dreamers and the rest of society, he certainly succeeded.The three dreamers have some, but ultimately too little, awareness of their separation from reality and the unsustainable nature of the world they create.  While sympathizing with the revolutionaries in the street, they actually are the ultimate materialistic consumers:  they produce nothing that they consume (neither food nor art), and when the money their parents provide runs out, and they've drained most of the wine cellar, the harsh realities of life set in.  Rooting through trash heaps isn't the answer, and the choices that they leave themselves in the end (self-annihilation or nihilism), I believe, show just how flawed their ideal world is.  My interpretation is that this lesson also applies to the other set of dreamers, the street revolutionaries, but those who even today sympathize with the views of those revolutionaries will reject this interpretation.`The Dreamers' is very voyeuristic, and Bertolucci puts his three leads through some incredibly intimate moments.  All three leads are quite good, with Eva Green in particular deserving special notice for a completely uninhibited performance (at least the two male leads had each other's example to follow).  It's hard to come up with an accurate overall rating for this film, because I think there will be a widespread variance in how different people react to both the storyline and the images.  Read the reviews carefully, and if it sounds like something that interests and won't shock you, then give it a try.  My middle-of-the-road rating is mainly due to my not being terribly interested in the type of relationship formed by the three main characters.",The Dreamers
100,ztruk2001,An open love letter to the cinema,9,9 April 2005,"It isn't surprising that many people have been thrown off or wierded out by Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers. This is the man who directed the great 1972 film, Last Tango in Paris, which threw out the rule book concerning what could be talked about and shown regarding sex in a non-pornographic film. The Dreamers isn't as revolutionary or shocking for it's day as Last Tango in Paris was, but it's every bit as daring and provocative. It is Bertolucci's homage to the movies themselves and the people that spend an infinite amount of hours in darkened rooms watching them. For us psychopaths out there where movies are more than a religion, myself included, The Dreamers lets us know we are not alone, however it also informs us just how alone we might be. Film is the greatest art form because it can be the most collaborative with many people's vision or the most individual. It combines music, sound, photography, acting, politics, religion, entertainment, fun, and everything into one package. What else other than the movies allows the beauty of a person who's been dead for a hundred years to shine forever? Long after all the Presidents are dead and long after the frescos of Michaelangelo have tarnished away, and long after the pyramids have eroded, we'll still have film. We'll still be able to watch Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Audrey Hepburn, and James Dean as though they were still alive. In fact as long as people watch their movies, they are alive. It's this sory of mentality and obsession that Bertolucci both praises but also warns the dangers of in his film The Dreamers. Michael Pitt (Matthew), presumably summoning up Leonardo DiCaprio with his performance, plays an American exchange student in Paris in 1968 during the student riots. He is pretty much a loner, an outcast, and misfit - both free and restrained by his undying love for film. In Paris he meets a pair of French siblings, a brother and sister played by Eva Green (Isabelle) and Louis Garrel (Theo), who share his affections towards the cinema and immediately befriend him and adopt him as one of their own. It's ironic that they choose to coronate him with the lyrical quote ""He's one of us! He's one of us!"" from Freaks. Perhaps they see themselves as freaks. It's a deep movie and it throws many curves at the audience which will push people's ideas of what is morally correct and incorrect to the extreme. The Dreamers breaks many taboos. Mostly the incestuous relationship between a brother and sister, who feel as though one another are their only true companions in life. It doesn't shy away from nudity, both male and female. Together the three of them, Matthew, Isabelle, and Theo form an emotional and sexual bond through their love of movies and their common feelings of being misplaced in the world. The Dreamers is a damn fine movie that might be difficult to appreciate because of its content. Something I really enjoyed was seeing the clips of the different movies in the film when the characters talked about them and played games revolving around the films. Breathless, Top Hat, City Lights, and Scarface are a few of the movies that are featured in The Dreamers.",The Dreamers

103,Foxterrier,"complete crap, frankly",2,15 March 2004,"I've never been so harsh in a one line summary, but there it is. I had a feeling within the opening minutes that oh-oh, I've made a mistake here. I'm kicking myself now for not sneaking out of my seat and into the theatre next door.Forgive me, but even if a story is wholly fictional, a yarn from end to end, you still need to BELIEVE in it, and it's characters, in order to enjoy the tale. With this one I couldn't, not from the first frames.
That's not true. I did enjoy the opening titles, the way the names appeared and disappeared like dancers within the steel lattice of the Eiffel Tower. But right after that, as soon as ""Matthew"" started telling us this fake memoir of what he supposedly did in Paris in 1968, my internal bulls--- meter spoke up like a rude child. ""You're not Matthew, you're some actor in a French movie directed by some guy with a big ego and a whoop-to-do reputation, and the year is 2003 not 1968."" Naturally I waited for story to get involving so as to shut up my internal little kid, but it didn't and he didn't either.Moving ahead now, let me just say that the lead actress is pretty. Very pretty. Embarrassingly so. And when she says of her brother Theo, ""he is always inside me,"" well, that pretty much speaks for all of us. Like one of John and Bo Derek's classics, two hours spent watching Isabelle prancing around in and out of her negligee would probably be both terrible yet...very worthwhile. Spoiler warning to future husbands: there's not much in the way of secrets left to tell.But the rest of this crap is crap. I've never seen a French movie try to look French before, but this one does. I've never seen a poet look more like hapless clerk from a hardware store, but their father does. And I've never seen two actors playing brother and sister who are so clearly pretending. You can feel it. The two sisters in ""In America"" FELT like sisters, not just because in real life they are. To me, the relationship between Isabelle and Theo just doesn't ring true.None of this rings true. And now I've spent more time writing this bad review than I did watching the stupid film.

104,MartinK75,Engrossing piece of nostalgia,9,31 May 2005,"The Dreamers is a lush, beautifully shot tribute by Bernardo Bertolucci to a famous moment in Paris' 20th century history, cinema and youthful sex. In 1968 Paris, intriguing film buff twins Theo and Isabelle meet fellow movie fanatic and somewhat naive American exchange student Matthew at the Cinematheque Francaise and invite him to stay with them in their parents' apartment whilst the parents are away on holiday. Over the next few weeks, the twins open Matthew's eyes to a new, closeted, decadent way of life whilst Matthew forces Theo and Isabelle to examine their own shortcomings with a view to change. The Dreamers is one of those movies where nothing much really happens for long stretches but the film held my interest throughout and I did care about the three lead characters and what would become of them, something very much to the director's credit. The use of actual footage from old movies intercut with shots of the main characters acting out the same scenes was inspired and a joy to watch, particularly the run through the Louvre from Bande a Part. The only disappointing aspect of the film was the ending which I thought was too abrupt. I was also unconvinced by the decision of the twins at the end to join the rioters; it was a surprise to find that they cared so much or even at all. For the vast majority of the film Theo and Isabelle live with Matthew in a very isolated menage-a-trois, seemingly blissfully unconcerned about the unrest on the streets outside. That aside, this is an absorbing, well acted film, benefiting from a carefully chosen and very apt soundtrack, a good mixture of American rock of the period and French standards.",The Dreamers

A story of the coming-of-age of an American boy, a story about love and attraction, a story about being young in 1968 Paris, a story about positive uncorrupted America versus intellectual and cynical France, and most of all a story on the contrast between private dreams and public dreams at the height of Europe's sixties students revolution. I think Bertolucci tried to put too many things in the movie and some aren't fully developed - great acting though.

107,honeybearrecords,Observers of the Band of Outsiders,9,11 March 2005,"The first time I saw this film, I really felt like it was made for me. You can probably understand why. First of all, Paris, May 1968, you know what goes down. Second, three people brought together by their love of film in the '60s. I was at the edge of my seat slack jawed. It's the kind of movie I wish everyone could appreciate and made me desperate to find someone to talk to that could understand this movie the same way I did.The story follows Michael Pitt though your identifying with him as a main character comes and goes. He is a young student studying for the year in Paris in 1968. He meets two fairly affluent twins, Theo and Isabelle, whose poet father and British mother are going away for a while. They meet at Cinematheque Francaise, which was the most important place at the time for film lovers. It's where Truffaut, Chabrol and Godard and others would come to discuss film. It was the essentially the birthplace of Cahiers Du Cinema. The first time we see Michael there, they are showing ""Sock Corridor"" and we get to see some of the key moments of one of Sam Fuller's greatest works.With their parents away, they invite Michael to move in with them. They are intrigued by his intellect and his encyclopedic knowledge of film. From there they live a life half in and half out of film constantly quoting and referring to films such as ""Breathless"", ""Freaks"", ""Blonde Venus"" and one of my all time favorites ""Mouchette"" while the director encourages them by switching from the three characters to the actual film footage seamlessly. In one amazing sequence, the trio reenacts the classic scene of Anna Karina and friends racing through the Louvre in ""Band of Outsiders"". The three are determined to break the films record of nine minutes and 45 seconds. Bertolucci switches back and forth between the original Godard film and his recreation to dizzying effect. For fans of the film, it's titillating and decadent far beyond any of the sex the film (as well as director) is known for.Sex is a big part of the film as the twins try to be aloof, but are as ultimately affected as Michael. During one of their many film quizzes, Michael is drawn into having sex with Isabelle. Only when they're done does he realize that for all her freeness and sophistication, she was a virgin. It is one of the few moments when she is completely emotional and not playing a part as she cries in his arms.The twins themselves are trapped in what can best be described a Platonic incest. This is where Bertolucci starts mining in familiar areas. His exploration of sexuality and un-discussed areas of possibility have been a theme in most of his twenty or so films. I first remember being fascinated by ""Luna"" when I was a kid. I had been in love Jill Clayburgh for some, probably Oedipal reason. In that 1979 film, she has an affair with her teen son. While moody and erotic, the film was dealing with such a taboo subject; it seemed like know one knew how to describe it other than surreal. It really wasn't. It was very real only dealing with an area of sexuality in a mostly objective manner.The backdrop of the film is Paris in 1968. I've probably written too much about this already. The student over-population in Nanterre mixed with their isolation outside of Paris mixed with the boredom of being a student while the world was erupting lead to massive political upheaval. By May, the students and workers were together having brought the entire country to a standstill. It was the closest thing to revolution in Europe since the Spanish Revolution. The three characters in this film don't represent what was really happening in the streets and that is probably a good thing because a lot of the film's success is its hands off attitude towards politics. Mathew is smug in his bourgeois ideas of non-violence and his fear of collectivization. Theo is completely dogmatic in his ill-informed Mao-ism ignorant to the fact that he is from the bourgeois and has totally alienated himself from the street battles happening daily. Isabelle lives for her brother and is ultimately un-phased by the world outside of their apartment.Bertolucci, for me anyway, is sort of hit or miss. It's fascinating to me that a man that can make ""The Conformist"" and ""Last Tango In Paris"" could also make ""Besieged"". It's hard to separate analysis and my deeper feelings about this movie. It's a love letter to May '68 and it's beautiful.",The Dreamers

What I'm saying, I guess, is that I expected to be shocked and I wasn't. What I liked about the movie was the fresh breeze that brought because of the different, unfamiliar subject for me - the youth of late 60' and another approach on evolution and discovering oneself, throughout the perspective of a twin brother and sister couple and their American friend. All of this involves a lot of sex, games, wine and movie talk, which are delightful. But it feels like there could have been more to it, more changes, more dramatic evolution. I enjoyed a lot the old movie scenes and the way Bertolluci intercalates them with the actual movie scenes. All the visuals seem descended from a beautiful painting especially the ones in which Isabelle is involved.",The Dreamers
110,Close_The_Door,This is by far the most disgusting and annoying film I have ever seen,1,25 January 2006,"I absolutely agree with the lady who wrote the comment having this object, this is why I take it as mine too.My friends and I went out of the cinema and flew to a pub not to remain with the memory of two disgusting boring useless hours.I had the precise sensation that Bernardo Bertolucci felt like making a porno film, but couldn't do it shamelessly, like Tinto Brass for example. Well, after watching ""The Dreamers"", my esteem for Tinto Brass boosted. Tinto Brass has the courage to make films about healthy, fun, enjoyable sex and pays his due for this, not being considered a ""great"" film-maker. Whereas ""great"" film-makers like Bertolucci or Kubrick shield their disturbed fantasies by the ""cultivated cinema"" illusion, gain prizes and kid us all.Incest is the clue of the film, the morbid relationship between a brother and a sister who can't grow up and have normal connections. A few disgusting scenes of having a bath with a menstruating girl, deflowering a menstruating girl (while her brother MAKES AN OMELETTE), sadomasochistic sex etc. Where is the connection with 68's revolution? Where is poetry? Does this film have a point after all? I felt duped while watching this film and consider myself as a normal IQ person. Boring disgusting useless film.",The Dreamers
111,baron-9,No nostalgia for me,5,22 February 2004,"Like Roger Ebert, who loved this movie, I was a child of the 60s, and was in Paris briefly at the time.  Although I watched a lot of movies, I guess I was not a film buff like these characters.  The photography was great, but the references to all the old films left me thinking, ""So what?""  And the sex scenes seemed like bad porn - if there is such a thing as good porn.  They just weren't arousing.  (When I think of poignant sex scenes, I always come back to Warren Beattie and Natalie Wood in ""Splendor in the grass,"" which conveyed the pain of NOT going all the way.)  So, many people loved this movie, but I hated it. For 60s nostalgia, Woodstock comes closer, but I haven't seen anything really all that close yet.",The Dreamers
112,carlos.virgile-3,Remembrance of things past,6,17 November 2003,"So much expectation could only lead to disappointment. What happened to the talent of Bertolucci? Is he the same director that made The Spider Stratagem, The Conformist or Last Tango? It is sad to see someone that represented a vision of liberation, of creativity, of intellectual rigour to have lost the touch of genius. Even his trademark directing style, the composition of the shots, the brillant camera movements and the sophistication of the editing seems to have been totally lost and replaced by middle of the road Americanised blandness. It is understandable in all creative artists to reach its peak and to gradually lower that very level of groundbreaking work. But to get this low? The Dreamers feels fake, forced, opportunistic, poorly acted, it doesn't flow naturally, using and appropriating itself of every cinematographic detail that would give it a feel for authenticity and credibility in the name of an homage to the Nouvelle Vague.A cocktail of Goddard, Truffaut et al that in spite of its attractive packaging fails to delivered the goods. It is not only the very essence of what the cinema d'auter was trying to achieve in'68 that is missing but also the real spirit of the Paris revolution, the search for a better order, idealistic as it might have been.The central characters and the context in which they live never seem to mix. They are like two different systems running in parallel but separately. The political and social context becomes a backdrop, a place and a moment but nothing more than that. The characters motivations, neither their political or sexual rebellion never brought into the surface of the story. They seem to be spectators and not participant of what it is happening outside, an audience in many ways similar to that of the Cinemateque film buffs they are. There is no holly innocence in these ""enfants terribles"" but mere stupidity.Perhaps Bertolucci had this in mind and it was his intention to show this light commitment of the petit bourgeoisie and the futility of their social and political pretensions.Also the role of their parents seems false. Their attitude when coming back to find a kind of domestic Jules et Jim scene in their living room seems more appropriate to post-liberated people brought up after the '60s that real French middle class parents at the time, even accepting the characters intellectual aspirations.In spite of these comments and quite a few longueurs in the script the film is still enjoyable to watch. There is an aesthetic voyeuristic eye in Bertolucci's film and who can not but enjoy being inside a rather grand Haussmanian Paris apartment with three beautiful young things inside shockingly walking around in the nude. If this was the intention of its possible commercial appeal the success de scandal is guaranteed.",The Dreamers

114,vernoncoffee,Film Buff Challenge for those of you who like Dreamers as much as I do,9,28 November 2006,"The Dreamers has two separate themes; the first is about the 1960s, in the West, though the eyes of youth: most particularly in Paris; the student movement, the cultural revolution; sex, drugs and cinema. The second theme is CoA (coming of age): a private world that an exceptional brother and sister have made, and into which they invite a kindred spirit, an American student. The themes intertwine, but they are distinct, which creates the richness of the film as each theme provides both background and motivation in the other. I think most critical reviews miss the mark when they lock on to one aspect (usually centering on the sexuality) and overlook what else the film is saying. And just for the record, when it comes to the subject of incest, granted Theo and Isabelle take adolescent sexual exploration to the extreme; but in my opinion the film is clear that when Isabelle has sex with her new boy-friend, she is a virgin. Theo and Isabelle were simply consistent in their shared enthusiasm of exploring life together; the problem is they tended towards the excessive everywhere.I find The Dreamers Historically Interesting, Deliciously Nostalgic, Sensuous, Sexy and Impetuous. So here is a film buff challenge for those of you who like it as much as I do. I made up a list of the films referred to in The Dreamers and watched them as a group, most of which I had not seen before; then watched The Dreamers again. It made it that much richer, (for example you understand why the sultry Greta Garbo so desperately wants to remember the details of that room and then you see how the apartment has become that same kind of fleeting refuge for the three students). Then there is Bande a Part, by Jean-Luc Godard; watching it on DVD along with the exhaustive reference notes in the extras, in my opinion The Dreamers is one long homage to Bande a Part. So here is a list of the 13 films for you to enjoy in themselves and added texture for The Dreamers:Shock Corridor, the Cameraman, Breathless (a bout de souffler), Top Hat, City Lights, Band Outside (Bande a Part) Blonde Venus, Freaks, Scarface, King Kong, Queen Christina, The third Man, Les Enfante Terrible.",The Dreamers

116,ikonoklastik,Pretty good film.,8,19 February 2004,"(some spoilers) It's not a masterpiece but it certainly is good. Quite good, actually. The theme behind the film revolves around the idea of the relationship of a person to the world and the place love has in that relationship. The presentation of the idea was pretty much standard: it began at the dinner table directly following the character introduction portion of the film. The topic there was that, from the macro point of view that God may have of the world, it is beautiful and orderly regardless of how chaotic it may seem on the inside. The main characters proceed to live in a fantasy world where everything is beautiful and there main focus is cinema and sexuality. But that eventually breaks down. The story articulates that people cannot see things through the eyes of God and chaos, pain and loss will always be part of your life. Any attempt at concerning one's self solely with art and love is terminal and will end with a return to the confusion of reality. The character Matthew foreshadowed this idea in the beginning when his voice-over said, as he and his newfound friends strolled lakeside, that he never wanted that evening to end. The whole philosophy of the film is expressed predictably but very nicely and is packaged in an attractive box of beautiful editing and cinematography and succeeded in subtly, almost as a light aside, putting art on a divine pedestal. I think there may be important commentary channeled through the history presented that I did not pick up on because I didn't live through the events to understand the nuances. And that would only add to the depth of the film. Although I feel Bertolucci is purposely making his films racy for the sake of shock and his own amusement, it was a very enjoyable movie to see (not the raciness; the movie). 8/10.",The Dreamers

Dreamers portrays the free love lifestyle that I heard everyone else was living, but that I never actually saw. An American in Paris, Matthew is taken home by a French brother and sister and finds himself being seduced by the impossibly beautiful and smokingly sexy Eva Green-with the full cooperation of her brother, Theo. Strangely enough, he resists Isabelle (Green) to the point that he actually offends her. I felt that Matthew kind of let us American boys down by his reaction to a nude Eva Green offering herself to him. Matthew eventually joins in the fantasy and the fun, but there is a constant tension between Matthew and Theo, and between Matthew and the whole set-up. Frankly, I found Matthew's character not believable compared to how most guys his age would react.",The Dreamers

119,FilmFanatic09,The Dreamers,9,4 December 2006,"The characters of ""The Dreamers"" love movies. They pass their time quoting them, reenacting scenes from them, and debating age-old questions such as the merits of Chaplin versus Keaton. When at the cinema, they make sure to sit in the rows closest to the screen. Why? So the images will reach them before anyone else, while still fresh. If this strikes you as illogical, perhaps ""The Dreamers"" isn't the movie for you. This is a film about film lovers and will likely be most appreciated by lovers of film in return. The basic narrative follows Matthew, a young American (the boyish Michael Pitt), who is studying in Paris during the late 60s, the time of the student riots. The film does a good job of setting up the loneliness which engulfs him in this foreign place, so we are quick to understand why he so eagerly accepts the offer to stay with French twins Isabelle and Theo (Eva Green and Louis Garrel) he has met at- where else?- the cinema. As the three take up life in their spacious Parisian flat, vacated by the twins' parents while abroad, Matthew senses that something about these two is a bit off. It isn't long before he is aware of the incestuous undertones constantly present in the twins' interactions with one another. In attempting to confirm that their relationship does have some degree of limitations, Matthew questions Isabelle, receiving the chilling response, ""He is always inside of me."" It may be reassuring to Matthew, as well as many audience members, that no, these characters never sleep together in the literal sense. What is at work here is something much more difficult to explain. The film handles it well. Eventually, in an attempt to break Isabelle out of her self-inflicted dependency on her brother, Matthew asks her on a date, which proves to be the most joyfully innocent moment of the film. From here, things turn slightly ambiguous and the film opts to relinquish the personal, in favor of a more political ending. It is interesting to note the closing credits run over chanteuse Edith Piaf's ""Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien"" (No, I Regret Nothing). If we knew whether or not this was chosen in irony, a lot would be explained. One can't help compare ""The Dreamers"" to Bertolucci's other Parisian-set exploration of erotica, ""Last Tango in Paris."" That film contained two lovers who were very much dead inside. ""The Dreamers"" contains three who are filled with youthful exuberance and have seemingly endless passion for things such as politics and the arts. Both films are frank and graphic in how they depict sex. As a matter of course, both stirred much controversy. I suspect many people will watch ""The Dreamers"" already expecting to be incensed by it. That is their loss. For those who are willing, ""The Dreamers"" can be a changing experience. What exactly it changes, however, is certainly bound to vary from person to person. Perhaps it will force you to reconsider your political outlook. Possibly it will alter how you view societally unacceptable relationships. Conceivably it could lead you to the realization of just how great an impact the films have on some people and their existence. Or maybe it will change your stance on who really was better: Chaplin or Keaton? Side note: I found it endlessly refreshing to find a film where characters spoke in their native language when appropriate, and the audience was forced to make-do with subtitles.",The Dreamers
120,ichapman,Acting straight?,1,9 February 2004,"Asked to explain the almost total absence of the homoerotic element of his novel, screenwriter Gilbert Adair has cited the need for the three main actors, who are heterosexual, to feel 'comfortable' in their roles.One thinks back to the generations of gay lead actors and actresses who managed to convince audiences of their attraction to co-stars for whom they can have felt nothing.  This particular skill is known as ACTING - a skill apparently not expected of the pampered little darlings here.Not that they looked particularly comfortable, anyway, in their protracted cavortings.

Otherwise, mildly absurd, highly pretentious nonsense only relieved (!) by bouts of beautiful young things being all naked and sexy for the camera.Very shortly after I spotted what the game was (and I'll leave that for you), I fell asleep. When I woke up, they were still quoting lines from movies, having lots of sex and being very daring in a bourgeois kind of way.The film does succeed in being very French in an overly-stylised fashion, but only if you think that 1968 and Satre is what it's all about.

122,thehellhole,"Mr.Bertolucci, you dirty old man",1,4 April 2007,"Mon dieu, ""The Dreamers"" is one crappy art-house movie! It's highly self-indulgent, pretentious and offers nothing except a glimpse on Eva Green's luscious anatomy (and some bare butts and small sized wieners for the more female male out there).The story is paper-thin and laughable at times. The ""shocking moments"" in the movie (rubbing menstruation blood in the face, incest, masturbation while someone is watching, etc..) all feel forced and do not serve the story at all. There are more subtle ways to show that the main characters are deranged and decadent than wanting someone to shave pubic hair as a proof of love.Here's the basic outline of the story: naive American student meets French twins while protesting at the cinematheque in Paris. They invite him to live with them at their flat while mommy and daddy are away on a long long trip. The three create their own world of rebellion and decadence and screw everything up in the end.There were two hilarious scenes I really could enjoy: 1) ""The Dreamers"" are out of money and food, so naked Theo (the twin bro) puts on a jacket (nothing else) and goes straight for the garbage can in the backyard to find something to eat. I literally could not stop laughing!2) Isabelle (the twin sis) finds daddy's paycheck and realizes that their parents visited them while they were sleeping naked in the tent, so she decides that they have to commit suicide because of the shame. She takes a hose from the kitchen to kill the boys and herself with gas. But SUDDENLY there's a riot on the street, they all wake up, Isabell has to change her plan, quickly puts back the hose and tries to act casual.The characters in ""The Dreamers"" act ""highly illogical"" as Mr. Spock would say. This fact combined with the impression that all three are arrogant morons, who think ""Well, f*** up the system, cause daddy is going to fix it!"", makes the story really offensive. I'm in my late 20ies but I wanted to kick them all in the nuts, except Eva Green, mainly for anatomical reasons.If you want to see an interesting film about incest, dysfunctional relationships and consequences watch ""The Cement Garden"" or way better, read the book by Ian McEwan.",The Dreamers
123,Hertsmere,Insipid,2,12 January 2007,"An unfortunate by consequence of the film is that Eva Green's nude photos are available everywhere on the Internet. Like other actresses, Eva Green will find with the passing of time, as her looks fade, that her decision to appear nude will come back to haunt her, as any new theatrical or film triumph will lead to renewed interest in her nude photos.She will learn the bitter lesson that there is more to being an actress than getting your clothes off and boobs out.The sexual relations of three main characters serve to expose their thoughts. For instance, when Theo is shown to masturbate it is in the context that the one he loves the most, his sister, seems to be growing away from him and he can see the development of a relationship between the newcomer and his sister that excludes him.The film is disturbing for the hinted unnatural relationship between brother and sister, a relationship that borders on Incest. The chaos in ordered family relationships mirrors the chaos on the streets outsides as France experiences the turbulent May 1968 days of the student revolt.As for Bertolucci, the phrase that comes to mind, in regard to him, is ""dirty old man"". What exactly is the artistic merit in close ups of the male sex organ ? Gratuitous nudity does not signify a great film.Sex is only interesting as an active pastime, watching other people have sex is boring.The more artistic a movie is, the greater the separation from common sense.",The Dreamers
124,PurityofEssence100,Tragedy of a Ridiculous Director,1,4 March 2004,"Even by today's standards Bertolucci's films of the early 70's, The Conformist and Last Tango in Paris, are powerful mixes of seductive Italian movie making with a fiery, if pessimistic, brand of Marx's Freudian politics.  
Now three decades later Bernardo returns to scene of his great triumphs to see if he can't turn one more cinematic trick.  His new film The Dreamers shouldhave had a lot going for it. What couldn't you do with a three way sexualencounter staged in Paris in the midst of May '68?  And the fact the story's three young `dreamers' are also cinema buffs should provide for an interesting twist or two, plot or otherwise.  But my God, what on Earth was the great Italiandirector thinking?  This movie is singularly awful.  Two hours of pointlesspretentious masturbatory (literally) drivel!  The film's underlying problem is not technical; it's not the acting, staging, or even the directing.  Some of the sets, like the kids' tent, are actually quite beautiful.  The problem of the movie isconceptual!  Bertolucci thirty years along has absolutely nothing original to say about people or politics, music or art, sex or life. Which is ironic given that the historical setting of The Dreamers is May '68, probably the greatest revolutionary moment of the past fifty years.  May '68 is the historical moment out of which the notion that the authority of the state had so ingrained itself into the conscious and unconscious discourse of the culture that our modern way of life, which prides itself on being `democratic"" and free, is now mired in a horrible situation of unfreedom.  More than anything else this modern state of unfreedom, this end of the `Enlightenment', has been THEproblem for critical thinkers of the past half-century.  But you won't find anything than more than a wisp of that historic problem here.  For the Dreamers May '68 is a time to remember the way we were, a sentimental education, in which thecharacters argue in the most uninteresting and almost banal terms aboutmovies and music (Hendrix was better than Clapton!), while exploring theiradolescent sexuality.  And I really didn't think it was possible to make sex seem so boring.  But there it is.

Sure the world and film have become mechanical, and when anything different shows up we call it art, and are relieved. Just as the rarity of diamonds bestows them their value, originality and anything daring gets an applause. Still, you don't see the culinaries of France suddenly turning to cannibalism. What a stupid movie.In short, I hate this movie so much I can't even comment on it. A political message? More like, Bertolucci is so down and out that he needs to find young actors to exploit and get attention, because nobody is interested. One can only hope that these potentially talented people don't end up with the same fate that struck the heroine of Last Tango, which for years later children threw blobs of butter at in the street in mockery, whenever they saw that poor actress who once dreamed of greatness but instead got bathed in dripping wads of cholesterol buy cruel little children-herods. Last tango, was also deemed a masterpiece, but its just a porno too.And oh yeah, this is supposed to be about the sixties and revolutions. Notice the use of Jimmy Hendrix in the trailer, and the black turtle necks. What a degrading experience it was to see this. Just because its different (not Ben Affleck) don't believe its art.

At first seemingly casual, later on rather compulsive, the behaviour of the twin brother and sister, matched with the young Californian student absorbed me totally and drew me into the atmosphere of Paris 1968. The riots and strikes claiming to be the cultural revolution for the french, the love for European and American films (Bertolucci didn't show asian films here, like the works of Ozu or Satyajit Ray), the need to free oneself expressed in sexual and political freedom, it's all fresh and new again here.

Revolution breaks out and the world seems to be in a critical turning point, but inside the four walls of an apartment, three youngsters experience their very own revolution.Yes, it's true. In the year 2004, one of the best cinematic experiences is offered by Bertolucci. Many are those who'd thought that he had nothing more to give, but with THE DREAMERS, the creator is reborn and next to his heroes he witnesses again the passage from adolescence and innocence to the age of responsibilities. A great fan of cinema himself, he doesn't hesitate to pay a number of tributes, just like Godard used to do in the past and Tarantino very recently. As he puts his view into the eyes of his protagonists, the girl and the boys seem to live inside the movies they adore. They're playing with lines from known films, they imitate characters, they put themselves into the sequences they love.Despite their young age, all three actors not only do they show that they're worth of starring in a Bertolucci film, but they also go even further giving in every scene the necessary vividness and realistic tension. Ignoring the cosmogony taking place in the streets, they surrender to their own cosmogonic changes, to the wild sexual awakening, to the game between friendship and love, pleasure and pain. Eventually they commit themselves to the struggle between the game itself and real life. And that's where the heroes violently return in the thrilling final sequences in order to face their duty towards history.THE DREAMERS is by far one the best motion pictures of the year, so daring but at the same time so energetic that seems able to touch anyone as a pure and romantic confession of a great filmmaker.",The Dreamers
129,brockmporter,Not a very good movie,3,25 August 2005,"This movie struck me as the sort of movie that would be considered ""Artsy"" because it was about people who have no connection to pop culture, and do things that are quite depraved rather unabashedly. In this case they are young, idealistic film (NOT ""movie"") buffs, who have the added bonus of being extra-artsy by virtue of being not only European, but in fact French. The story is not particularly gripping, nor are the characters at all sympathetic.Matthew, the American boy, meets two twins he finds fascinating, but who frankly come off as weird, guarded, and strangely off-putting. Nonetheless, they welcome him into their odd world, where they are basically having an incestuous relationship. What happens is then described by many as a ""sexual awakening"" but is in fact a rather poorly disguised voyeuristic look into some very unrealistic fictional characters.The twins, Isabel and Theo, turn out to be very shallow and snooty, but motivated by some sort of need to prove how deep they are. (Artsy!) Isabel then loses her virginity to Matthew basically because Theo dares her to. They then spend the next few days ""making love"" (which is the arty French-guy term for the fairly grotesque acts of depravity and incest that are going on here), until they run out of food and begin to eat garbage. See?? The stark humanity of sex and suffering? Artsy! This is ART, guys! In the end, nothing continues to happen until a riot breaks out as a result of the French people not being able to watch ""feelms"" anymore, by which time I found I didn't really care whether these people lived or died, and was mostly upset that I had missed ""The Daily Show"".",The Dreamers

131,dragicakosir,Life is but a dream (?),10,15 February 2019,"The history repeats itself? I don't believe it. It's rather that we, the people, repeat the mistakes of our ancestors. The film is a series of scenes charged with sexuality, drugs and egoistic love. Shocking ideas that have launched in my mind an avalanche of thoughts and notions - some kind of an inventory of my own life and the life of the whole that transcends me, i.e. the mankind.
It's been many, many times that we tried to save the world by means of physical love, being the most familiar one to us all and the easiest one to get to it. However, this path has already been trodden. How many times so far and how many times it needs to be trodden yet? The path from the greatest union, i.e. physical love, to the biggest retreat form the man and mankind - fear, hatred, violence. As if the hatred would increase by the act of making love and release by real love.
Each war is getting worse, and in consequence it leads only to the doom of civilization. In times of freedom the differences between people grow, while in war times they diminish - at least, or unfortunately, mostly due to the number of the dead. Thus, we build on the mistrust, on the humanity as a whole, we build on illness; we build on all that what in fact nobody wants. In other words, we pull down our world. The Creator made me big, humankind makes me small. I was created a man, not the humankind. I am a brick in his foundation, not in the global religion.

132,seishino,A disquietingly beautiful film,10,28 October 2006,"To steal a metaphor from the movie, The Dreamers is like watching your parents have sex through the keyhole of their door. It disturbs you, sometimes so deeply that you want to run away. But it is so real that you can't stop watching. And as you watch it, your view of the world changes a little.This is not an easy movie. It starts out lighthearted, innocent, and 2-dimensional. But as it progresses, it gets deeper and deeper and the characters get more and more complex. Uncomfortable aspects of the people are brought to the forefront. While it doesn't bask in hedonism like most Hollywood films, it doesn't shy away from any controversial subjects as long as they're the reality of the people.You don't have to be in an open relationship to identify with the situations the characters find themselves in. Taking place almost entirely with three people in one large house, it's amazingly acted, wonderfully heartfelt... If you are strong enough to watch it, The Dreamers is well worth the effort.",The Dreamers

134,sarwatesm,Confusing,7,19 May 2012,"Bertolucci is considered a vary good director and I have seen some of his other works like Last Tango and Stealing Beauty, but somehow the storyline is always complicated at times which does not reach to conclusion or leave you somewhat confused at the end.Dreamers is otherwise superbly filmed but at the end it does not reach anywhere. Though fine acting by Eva Green as Isabelle, Michael Pitt as Matthew and Louis Garrel as Theo. The background of 1968 Paris when the students took to streets works wonderfully and the passion for films amongst the young lead characters is interesting. The sex though filmed in length does look mild. So overall it is good viewing experience and certainly worth watching. 7 out of 10 from me",The Dreamers
135,canperincekster,Raw anti-violence message,6,1 July 2016,"Overally, it was not a bad movie. Cinematographically it was a good movie, the camera angles were impressive sometimes. The idea giving references to the movies was creative and significant for the movie's course.However, I think, the story was weak. There were disconnections in the story. The plot does not fulfill the expectations of the audience. Compared to the other movies of Bertolucci, the messages given were hazy and loose. Other than that, I did not like the political messages -which were really given too clearly- of the movie such as the idea that favors individualism over collectivism, or raw anti-violence discourse. In the last scene, the movie establishes a cause and effect relation between the violent behaviors of the protesters and the intervention of the police forces. Therefore, in a way, it justifies the police intervention and damages the political legitimacy of the protesting side.",The Dreamers
136,yakupkonars,I think this one gave me wings at last.,10,4 March 2006,"I think this one gave me wings at last. After I watched that movie, I witnessed another dimension and aim of the art of cinema; seeing what you want to see and not trying to judge the morality of it just for two hours. Many audiences consider the movie as an erotic one, which is close to soft porn. I do not think that Bertollucci' main purpose was to sexually satisfy the watchers by showing the CLOSE relations between three teenagers. Beyond that, the movie underlines the basic idea and aim that prevailed during the 68 period: free spirit, by using these teenagers's love of cinema and partly NAKED relationships between. The director shows his respect to this period by putting many flashbacks from some movies like Godard's Bande a Part. We all know that Bertollucci has always been close to the leftist views. Like other films of Bertollucci, this one also had its share from his political and philosophical opinions, under the combination of a deep love against the French culture. In Turkey, the name of the film translated as 'Dusler, tutkular ve suclar': 'Dreams, passion and crimes'. Although I do not like using a translated name of a movie instead of the original one, I think it successfully summarizes the movie. Our characters Matthew, Isabelle and Theo are living in a dream world. The twins constructed it maybe after birth and later Matthew involved. Everything was perfect first, and then a passion full intention starts between Matthew and Isabelle. We can think Isabel and Theo as a single being, physically separated mentally joint. This situation prepares a base for the criminal side of the story. They believe what they see and fit their opinions. The twins do not want to change in fact. After Matthew involved we may say he forced them to change rapidly in an unplanned way. I want to say that definitely this is not a popcorn movie. Do not watch it with your parents or girlfriend. However, it is a must-see and a good opportunity to have an idea of the political and cinematic atmosphere in the late 1960s.",The Dreamers

I have a list of movies I want/need to watch and for some reason this was on it. I could not remember for the death of me why so I decided to give it a go. Lately I've been watching quite a lot of movies and I'm trying to watch these sort of artsy ones more too so when it comes to that - it did not dissappoint. As for why it was on my to-watch list, I realized during the tub scene that I saw a gif on tumblr once regarding a certain part of it and thought I should give it a go.
Through the whole movie the scenery was great. Loved all the city shots, rooms cluttered with trash that all fits together, the constant flirting - actors with each other, with the audience, with the scenery. It definitely gives of some sort of a Sleeping Beauty (2011) vibes.
Overall, I'd say it was good. Seemed natural in a way I can't even explain (even though not that many things were ''normal'' in the whole picture).",The Dreamers

A word of caution to parents there is a lot pf nudity in this and that includes some full frontal scenes. My only regret in this is a film about zero inhibitions should certainly have none, but, that is not the case. While there is plenty of sexual innuendos between the to men there isn't much displayed. In the end *I* felt as betrayed as Pitt's character must have and felt disappointed by the end - which is why I gave it eight instead of ten stars.

I think it was attempting to be profound, but succeeded in being as I have already described it. It is about three teens who become involved in the Paris riots of 1968. That is a great story and the acting is not bad. However, It just did not work at the deeper level. I did not identify with the characters and most of the time I just found them silly and pointless.
I also think we were supposed to be shocked by the naked scenes, but we've seen them all before, and if we've seen Baise Moi then we've seen much, much more. The three main actors were okay but nothing to write home about, these being, Louis Garrel, Michael Pitt and Eve Green. Anna Chancellor was a non-event. It was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci so it should have been better I suppose.I wanted to really like this filmm as I love the films from this era, Klute, etc. I also love the Piaf, Joplin and Hendrix soundtrack. However, whilst Fonda, et al, seemed as if they were really angry and attempting to say something, the actors in this film felt, to me, like spoilt kids from the 2000's who were part of the rave and drug scene.

I was switching the TV programs, but nothing interesting was going on. Then, I saw a girl chained to a gate and a boy watching her. They started talking. I started watching. That's the first time I saw ""The Dreamers"". I was mesmerized by the story and the characters. I enjoyed every scene of it. After that, I just wanted to watch the film again and again and again! I bought the DVD and watched it at my heart's will. Isabella was so stunning, Matthew was so innocent and Theo so vulnerable: I loved them even more with every new watch. But then, I found out that there is a book called ""The Holly Innocents"" by Gilbert Adair and I just had to have it. But, I couldn't find it anywhere for years. Then, one day, searching something on the Net I found the book by the same name as the film, ""The Dreamers"", and there were Isabella and Matthew on the cover. I bought it and read it like no book before and I loved the story even more. Thanks to Gilbert Adair for writing the book and the screenplay, thanks to Bernando Betrolucci for directing this film and thanks to Eva Green, Michael Pitt and Louis Garrel for playing the three characters that after Harry, Ron and Hermione are my absolute favorites.",The Dreamers
141,apavel-1,those were the days,5,24 March 2004,"Deeply disappointing 'comeback' movie for Bertolucci as we were all led to believe that The Dreamers was his masterful return back into 'Last Tango' territory and abandoning his US-friendly big budget mainstreams.  But we were wrong. The king is dead. This limp, uninspiring tale of cinema-loving siblings that befriend an American writer, is bland to the extreme. Eva Green has a face that belongs on a cinema screen, and a body to match, but she just can't act.  Michael Pitt is marginally better, but he gets very little in return from his female counterpart to act otherwise.But it's Bertolucci who depresses the most.  Where is the flair, the bravura, and the style of his masterpieces 1900 and Il Conformista. And where is the eroticism needed to ignite this film.  Still nestled within Brando's camel overcoat it seems.",The Dreamers
142,petabit,Rewards a second viewing,9,1 May 2010,"I admit, the first time I saw this, back in 2004, I was just enjoying the sexual romp and Eva Green's body. This time I was way more impressed with the cinematography and the character development. And yes, all three of them develop! The character arcs only become apparent if you listen to the French dialogue carefully as well as the English. But do watch it again with a French speaker and try. Here's how it strikes me: Matthew begins as a deep thinker with a strong moral sense, but rather detached from the world and submerged in movies and images. His lovely Asperger's-influenced speech to the Father about the lighter's proportions and the interconnectedness of all things shows where he begins. He is convinced that there is a moral right and wrong, though not quite committed to which is which.Theo, by contrast, is an idealist in his own mind, but has no intention of actually living or dying for his ideals. He prefers to wax passionate in private about his convictions, which are based on fads of the moment and whatever propaganda seems most beautiful to him at the time. Matthew challenges Theo to live his convictions, but Theo angrily refuses.And Isabelle is a narcissistic baby, obsessed with movie images and acting them out, seeing herself always from the outside, and desperately in need of love. She is the driver of all the action up until the window breaks.Originally, Isabelle sees attractive young Matthew as completing the cocooned relationship she and Theo have built. He will be 'one of them', and enrich and legitimize their forbidden love. Theo buys into her idea, enjoying the interplay of ideas with Matthew and attracted to him too, and using him as a surrogate for the sex he'd rather be having with Isabelle but has denied himself.Matthew quickly grows up though. He loves them both but sees that the twins can never 'grow up' while wrapped in each other. Isabelle cannot live without her brother's love, and cannot live if it's discovered either. Matthew tries a traditional one-on-one relationship with Isabelle, and Theo counters by bringing home his own girlfriend. Isabelle feels betrayed and breaks down -- her true love is Theo, a reflection of herself. Matthew realizes he'll always be an outsider to them. Isabelle and Theo have a touching mumbled sleepy private conversation in French where she insists that she wants nothing but Theo's love, forever, and exclusively.Waking first and realizing her parents have seen them, she attempts a romantic, movie-scene painless murder-suicide for the three of them. Again, she would rather die than grow up.When the window breaks, reality intrudes in every way, and each character suddenly grows up. Isabelle abandons her suicide, hides the evidence. Matthew realizes that the violent demonstrations are meaningless violence and renounces them. And Theo shoos them all outside to join the street demonstration.The ending is perfect -- Theo pulls Isabelle away from Matthew, who refused to fight. Theo and Isabelle begin the riot and huddle together in the center of the violence, ready to die, as Matthew walks away. Theo has responded in the only way he can -- both to Matthew's challenge to live his convictions, and Isabelle's insistence that he never grow up or leave her. Wow.",The Dreamers
143,josepharrocha,Sex and Never ending Revolutions,10,23 December 2003,"One thing is sure, this is one of the best films made in the lasts years. Bertolucci is capable of showing a very high artistic level ( from the photographic point of view for example )and telling the never ending and and wonderful story of the lost innocence, the firsts sexual acts and the limits of the friendship. All this could be useless without a context like the Cultural Revolution in 1968.

However, the sex scenes in the movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I am in no way a prude, in fact, the dirtier the better, so I couldn't put my finger on what had disturbed me so much about this film. At least not until I signed onto this message board and read what someone else had said. That's when a light switch clicked. Never in my life have I watched a film before where young actors were so exploited. I found myself actual cringing several times throughout the movie, as well as mouthing WTF several times. I felt like a freaking voyeur. The French can call it art all they want, but I just call it disgusting.",The Dreamers
145,tom-1203,Smug nonsense,3,15 July 2006,"At first it looked like this film could be fun but its shortcomings were so blatant that after about the first half hour the only enjoyment you can get out of it is by carping and criticising and making witty sideswipes to your friends (opportunities for which are plentiful).The French student riots of 1968 are established as the backdrop at the start of the film, and are crudely re-inserted at the very end. Through the main body of the plot that background's completely irrelevant, except that sporadically one of the main characters will read out a few lines of political philosophy to each other.The main plot is an awkward ""three's a crowd"" sexual coming-of-age story, where the wide-eyed American Matthew, naive to the point of self-parody, inserts himself into the incestuous relationship between two Parisians. Isabelle, as is typically the case in this sort of set-up, isn't really a protagonist but gets pulled between the two men who act as poles. The thing that offends me about the whole incest story is not, like most people who disliked the film, that I've got a moral objection, but the fact that it fails to develop in any way. We've got Theo, straight out of a nineteenth century opium den, being withdrawn and arrogant, and when he can't get his way through intimidation occasionally tries to strangle people. Then we've got Matthew who is distressingly earnest and comes up with sickening things all the time along the lines of ""we're all connected"", ""love is the greatest force"" but apparently has no objection to sitting in the bath with Theo having smug, ill-informed political debates and throwing menstrual blood around.None of it makes any sense. Isabelle and Theo are testing the boundaries of sexual norms in their corrupt bohemian boudoir and they choose to involve the completely incongruous Matthew. Why? - because he likes films, you see, and they need someone to run around the Louvre with them. Predictably Matthew, who thinks this is all larks for a while, soon enough tries to persuade Isabelle that sleeping with your brother is well, pretty wrong, you see, and girls your age should be going out with a boy to the cinema, drinking cherryade and paying for it by putting out a bit in the back row. But Theo, who's read about Mao Tse Tung don't you know, isn't to keen on this injection of capitalist bourgeois morality separating him from his big-breasted sister.So what does the film turn into - it's basically Matthew trying to make a 2-hour porn film with Isabelle, but having to appease Theo by occasionally getting into the bath with him and making arguments so desperately crass that Theo looks like an intellectual. Really this is an appalling hatchet job of a film, I've seen pornos with better characterisation and more subtle socio-political debates than this. Each of the three stars I've given belong to a part of Eva Green's (Isabelle's) anatomy.",The Dreamers

It was filmed in a very interesting layout, scenes interspersed with classic film imagery. Beautiful acting done by the young cast and not to mention brave. Movies should all be more like this, less afraid to show natural parts of life, aka, sex and nudity and such. Hopefully one day it will become more acceptable to show this than violence. What is more offensive in the end?...This film also had amazing music with it. Everything from Janis Joplin to the Doors. I also liked the fact that it had both English and french and it was set in Paris. It just added a nice change in scenery. It's easy for a young person to identify with this film because the characters loved going to the cinema and quizzing each other about popular movies.

148,juliolopeznavarro,Bertolucci has done it again!,9,1 July 2006,"Movies such as ""The Last Emperor"", ""The Conformist"" or ""Last Tango in Paris"" have remained as classics of contemporary European cinema. Although it may seem too soon to declare ""The Dreamers"" as a classic, it contains enough credits to assume that it will possibly stay in the mind and heart of contemporary audiences. What seems most interesting in this movie is the fact that you can tell it's a Bertolucci's movie. Through characters, situations, use of music, shots, photography and - most of all - the main thematic concerns, this movie is part of Bertolucci's universe. The story sets in Paris in the agitated days of the Cultural Revolution and talks about the intellectual and emotional relation between a couple of twins and a young American, the three of them being movie buffs. The movie reminds some other movies by Bertolucci, specially ""Luna"", in which he also tells a story of incest. I wouldn't recommend this movie to very sensible audiences since it is sexually explicit and too aggressive for conservative minds. Movie fans, however, will love it. There are plenty of references to great cinema classics that will drive movie goers crazy. Bertolucci's followers will be the most satisfied since it offers opportunities to relate it to his previous movies.

The graphic nature and scenes in this film show how far Bertolucci will go to create a great film. The relationship between the three characters is one of love. Not only between Matthew and Isabelle or Theo and Isabelle, but between all three characters. The love scene in the kitchen. The masturbation scene (which I am sure secured it's NC-17 rating, that and the nudity). All in all a great piece of not only film, but art in general.",The Dreamers

The movie is set in France, and follows an American student on exchange there. While the first twenty minutes seemed to have some direction, it pretty much lost it after that. There was little to no discernible plot line. It seemed like a bunch of guys sat around smoking cigars, then snapped their fingers, ""Oh! How about we show some more full frontal nudity!"" ""Yeah, yeah, that would be cool."" ""Wait, how about we just have them be really kinky and hang out in their house for the next hour?"" ""Yeah, that would be cool."" Now, one would think that all of this nudity and sexuality would be interesting. Regrettably, even the sex got boring. It was totally pointless. The only reason I can really see why people would like this movie is because they are mindless drones who follow the masses on what is hip and cool to like.

A prime example would be Devil in the Flesh with the show all oral sex scene or Last Tango in Paris (explicit for its time). The Dreamers is like those, a ""High Porn"" movie that lacks any plot or story that anyone would actually care about, yet has enough nudity and sex with a couple of attractive people that movie critics lacking the balls to go to a porn theater will get off on.

But even if we disregard this, the fundamental problem is the place in cinema history that the Dreamers wants to claim for itself. The film is psychologically vapid and devoid of any cinematic virtues. Basically, it's layers upon layers of decadence. Not only does it fail to pay respect to the films it references, but it does not even have the self-consciousness necessary to place itself in any kind of relationship to the tradition of cinema.

The female lead is a perfect natural beauty, and the male leads look and act young enough to feel very real. The movie is very earthy - possessed of a lack of shine and polish that makes it a wholly more satisfying experience than it could be with more sunshine and clean underwear.By far the best aspect of this movie, though, is the feeling of purpose that comes through the story - you envy the characters their direction and idealism.

This proves to me that the most naive people in the world about movies are, and have been for some time, film critics.Simply show these critics some nudity, European (in this case, French) mores, and sexual perversion, and voilàyou have an artistic film.To those of you who have been duped into thinking this film is great, let me assure you that I understand this movie completely and, yes, still think it's horrible. It's not artistic; it's pretentious, smutty, and shallow. The characters are not courageous rebels, they're reprehensible, self-centered deviants. Don't get me wrong. You could make a good movie about reprehensible, self-centered deviants. Just don't try to pass them off as cutting edge or courageous.And I'm not even talking about the incestuous sexual perversity. I'm talking about the characters being plain old boring and reprehensible. Just as an illustration: near the end of the film when the parents return home to find their two children and guest naked and passed out in a tent inside the apartment, amidst stinking garbage, empty wine bottles, and bodily fluids they couldn't be bothered to clean up, these parents leave their children (and guest) another check to further purchase the indulgences that have led them to their present situation. When the girl (I can't call such an immature, self-centered egomaniac an adult.) awakes and finds the check, (realizing that her parents were there and saw them in the state they were inI put this explanation in for those of you too unthinking to realize this movie is pretentious claptrap) what is her solution to this unacceptable level of accountability suddenly thrust upon her? Why, not only to commit suicide by turning on the gas and breathing it in herself, but to try to murder her brother and American lover. Does anyone else see a serious character flaw here?

163,vksharma2,Dreams are void,6,28 March 2006,"The name of the movie is very apt. As one watches the movie one feels that all characters of the movie are dreamers. Starting from the father, a poet who living in the house with his family does not know that his twin son and daughter living under the same roof are having a relationship bordering on taboo which as per the confession of Isabella if become known to her parents, she will kill herself and on finding out in the fag end of the movie that their relations have been exposed to the parents, really enacts the suicide. So father is a dreamer with his dreams flowing out of his pen- for him, poem is petition.Dreams being cut off from reality are always comforting and so the father withe his poetry.Dreamy poetry makes him a renowned poet. Isabella and Theo, twin brother and sister, in a living example of Yam and Yami the Indian mythological figure where sister Yami courts her brother Yam to acqisce to her yearning for physical relation with her,her argument being they were in coupulating position for nine months-are living a life which borders on general accepted standard of immorality as found by their American friendwho enters their lives. She lives with her brother sharing his room with no hold barred so far as activities termed as personal and private- Siamese twins mentally co-jointed - by the confession of Theo her brother.She maintains her room immaculate with no intrusion permitted including indulging sex with her friend Mathew. she does not want her room, a veritable dream chamber to be disturbed. Her brother, Theo, is also dreamer - dreamer of revolution which will come just by mental exercises like reading and discussion with her sisters and father, by quoting famous lines- a sort of mental masturbation which can be self fulfilling but can not be reproductive. Theier American friend Mathew is more pragmatic and worldly though finds common denominator with the brother-sister duo in cinemasthique, all of them being film buffs. This is one dream which Mathew shares with Isabella and Theo. The Riots of Paris - students revolt, Molotov cocktails are also a part of larger dream cherished by the student community who without any ideologically organized movement are driven by dream of some kind of revolution they will usher in, which they themselves know not. Isabella after knowing that their relationship has become known to the parents and after failed suicide attempt joins her brother in Molotov cocktail ceremony who all of sudden realizing that to fulfill dreams in to reality requires some kind of action, goes out full throttle and makes himself a part of larger crowd of dreamers. Acting wise, Isabella tops them all as her role is quite difficult to play, involving interplay of innocence due to her under exposure of the world reality and on the other hand, an awakening especially the sexual one which comes by the ageing process. Dominating Greyish hue in the movie reinforces the dreamy ambiance of the house. A very good movie to watch but one should not expect much intellectual problematizing- after all dreams are void.",The Dreamers

And I found it a great surprise. I´m just 18, so I saw some films of the nouvelle vague but i can´t be emotionally involved in may´68, because before the movie I hardly knew things about that fact. In the film it´s just the context, because the story itself is a love-sexual triangle quite ambiguous; different of most cinema love triangles, out of the topics. The actress Eva Green is just superb on this movie, the two actors are good as well. I think in the next years we will hear talk about them, spcially the girl and the american.Bertolucci mixes the movie with excerpts or classical movies, specialy nouvelle vague ones. And it is a thing I love about the feature, because it really deals with the context. The script is brilliant, much more critic than it is expected, with intelligent questions.About sexual scenes, they are very brave and reallistic, but quite interesting.  It is far from porno, scenes are exciting, very well made, not just sex. They are very explicit, but i wouldn´t censure the film for the US, it´s not for children but it is not a subversive film. Te soundtrack is just brilliant. The final song from edith piaff (non, je ne regrette rien) is the best Bertolucci could have chosen. I give it 9/10",The Dreamers
166,ad_nauseum81,a missed opportunity,6,9 February 2004,"Set against the vibrant background of Paris in the Spring of 1968, The Dreamers tells the story of three young film students; their lives and (not surprisingly) their dreams. Despite the tumult and ferment taking-place on the streets, the movie's narrative centres around the complicated relationships between brother Theo (Louis Garrel), sister Isabelle (Eva Green) and their newfound American friend Matthew (Michael Pitt).When their English mother (Anna Chancellor) and rich poet father (Robin Renucci) leave them in charge of their comfortable middle-class home, the siblings invite Matthew to stay with them. Sensing a kindred spirit, they involve him in their re-enactments of classic film scripts, and increasingly bizarre mind games. Cocooned in their own little world, they are for the most part oblivious to the social upheaval going-on around them. Police sirens wail outside, whilst inside the self-styled cultural revolutionaries mouth slogans like they've been plucked from the script of a really cool film. Eventually they come to a realization of sorts, but.well I won't spoil it.The Dreamers mixes many of the distinctive Bertolucci trademarks. The unabashed censor-baiting of Last Tango in Paris meets the sumptuous cinematography seen in Besieged. But for all its flashy camerawork, often slick scripting and some fine performances (especially Garrel), it somehow manages to disappoint, because the viewer is left wondering what the point of the exercise is. Maybe the lack of a point is the point, but I really can't be bothered trying to work it out.",The Dreamers
167,jonross-1,Love or Lust?,8,17 January 2005,"Bernardo Bertolucci's erotic thriller breaks the boundaries with this peculiar story of a twin brother and sister and their relationship with an American in the late 1960's. Though the acting and cinematography are well done, the symbolism of the story reminds me too much of Edgar Allan Poe's masterful short story ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" that is if you substitute vampire craving for sexual craving. After all is said and done the story is somewhat predictable halfway through, the foreshadowing is blatant and this takes away from what almost was a great film.

168,spuddybuddy,"Provocative and engaging, but ultimately disappointing",6,20 January 2009,"Bertolucci picks a volatile time and place - Paris in the late sixties - and follows three young, bohemian and idealistic characters in its midst. There's a lot of potential for romantic and political intrigue. The problem is, these characters choose remain aloof to their milieu for almost the entire film, preferring to hole up in a labyrinthine apartment to pursue a unique brand of hedonism.The best scene of the film is when Matthew is first invited to dinner with the family. The political position of each of the characters becomes very clear, and Bertolucci subtly undercuts each of them, driving home the point of the film. But after that, the bulk of the plot revolves around the threesome's erotic diversions and petty jealousies, inter-cut with scenes of the street protests in a seemingly arbitrary fashion.The film deserves credit for a nostalgic portrayal of Paris in the sixties, as well as delightful camera-work, intimate and voyeuristic, peering around corner after corner in the apartment to find new eye candy for the viewer.Overall, however, the film fell short for me; it fails to properly situate its characters in their context, and deprives them of enough emotional depth to make their trysts more than surface entertainment. 6/10",The Dreamers

This movie makes you wonder (unfairly perhaps) if Bertolucci's long-time collaborator, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (absent from this film) was actually responsible for the unforgettable images in Bertolucci's earlier movies.

Set in 1960's France during the French riots, a young American student is befriended by a brother and sister who happen to be Siamese twins. They are all linked by the common interest in old movies which they act out during outtakes of the actually films they are impersonating. It looks like Bernardo Bertolucci is paying an tribute to the by gone day of early film. This however is not the point of this film or is it? The story unfolds where by the young American is invited to join the twins at their home while their parents are away .Here they make their own rules as they experiment with their emotions and sexuality while playing a series of increasingly demanding mind games. The sexual content in this film will not appeal to everyone involving incest and long scenes of male and female nudity.To try and understand this film can be very confusing nor is it easy to see what Bernardo Bertolucci is trying to explore other than innocence and sexual freedom mingled together. He takes you for a ride that is slow and uneventful leaving you with a bitter sweet feeling of asking yourself what was the point of sitting through 2 hours of this film.",The Dreamers

The movie would have benefited from a solid plot instead of being a seemingly unconnected series of scenes. If you are looking for a movie that presents you with strangeness then this may qualify but if you want one that involves, or conveys a message, then this is probably not for you.

To my disappointment this movie lived up to none of my expectations. First of all, the best movies tell the best stories and The Dreamers contains no central story and really no plot what so ever. The graphic sexual nature of the film is neither an artistic expression of the human body, nor is it overtly pornographic, but simply exists as does the rest of the film, with no point and no effect. The Dreamers attempts to include classic elements of cinema, such as Charlie Chaplin films into the storyline, yet these brief inserts add little to the already under developed characters. The Dreamers is not an offensive film, but certain parts seem to attempt to get a reaction out of the viewer in an offensive way,such as when Michael (The American) wipes period blood all over Eva Green's face after they have sex and continues to kiss her while her brother looks on. This scene would not bother me in the least if it added something to the story or over all feeling of the film. The same goes for when Eva Green has her period in a tub that they all share and her and Theo attempt to shave Michael as a sign of trust. This movie has nothing to do with the French Cinema, the revolution or the late 60's or really anything else. I wouldn't watch this film again if I was paid.",The Dreamers

It's amazing, the difference it makes being able to hear each syllable as it's spoken as clear as a thought in your own head. With this in mind I found the dialogue a little pretentious. Also I found it easy to predict a lot of the dialogue which is something I dislike about a lot of films. The nudity shocked me. Not because I'm repressed or 'innocent' but because it's steps over boundaries as if they were pieces of gum on the pavement. It happens! BAM! An erection right there, so close you can nearly smell it! This didn't bother me as such, in fact I admired the actors for their courage and passion for their art to perform so outwardly. So far (over an hour in...probably more) I like it a lot. These are my opinions. I am not a critic. You can probably tell this fact from reading this drivel. In fact I dislike critics with a passion.

Ah, the young, naked bodies and the nearly tense student riots in Paris circa 1968. And it was free, because I would have been disappointed if it had been on Pay-Per-View. The plot was weak. Sanka when I could have used an espresso. But the lighting and photography were effective, nostalgic, and artistically coherent. A high-five to the art director.The sprint through Le Grand Louvre was fun but too short. And I enjoyed the old film references. The soundtrack rocked but those same great songs have pitched too many films and products by now because they are so successful. Take a risk with something else from that rich musical era.Now, don't get me wrong. As a red-blooded heterosexual, I appreciate a fine feminine form. But Eva Green's (cough) enhancements, kind of ruined it for me. Isn't she supposed to be a romantic innocent? She looked more like cybernetic Annika Hansen, the sexy Borg. Who keeps advising young actresses that they'll go nowhere unless they take to the knife? How old is Isabelle? Besides, imperfection creates character. Duh! For me, this was the fatal casting flaw. Worse than Michael Pitt who will continue to grow with better scripts. Otherwise, Ms. Green had a fine performance.Don't read my next comment if you don't want me to reveal the only unpredictable twist in the movie: I was pleasantly relieved when the suicide attempt was foiled by the student riots.

Bourgeois, loving, permissive parents who can't help but want to escape the numbing adolescent experimentation and naivete of children who are stuck in their dreamworld, working out their plan, their order, in childhood games, parents who, above all, leave the checks by the front door; it was the parents (to whom all the wrath of youth was initially aimed in the sixties - until world leaders became ""mommy and daddy"" - that is) who, in large part funded the sixties and it's rebellion, risk, and ultimate folding back into the wider culture of the world, into a synthesis; those of us who threw ourselves at that time period are now recalcitrant half-children, half-adults, we face the same world problems as our parents, addictions, wars, lethargy, some new solutions, we now grow older and ""wiser"", but we can look back, and i hope ultimately with something approaching fond wonder at the parents who stood aside as we took our now notorious shot at our new order.This film speaks on so many levels! It is a film about film, about youth, dreaming, about growing from dream to reality, about sex, about love, about the adventures of youth, their distinct smells, tastes and feel, about death; metaphoric death as children die into adulthood, as the world forced us all to do in that glorious, infamous time in history.On a more personal note, I can't consider my life truly complete until Mme.

So far so good. As the reel unfolded I managed to identify four (4) points of contention that could double as 'worries' [i.e. arguments/points relevant to the undoubtedly turbulent setting]1. The pseudo-philosophical ramblings of Matthew (Michael Pitt)  in the avec parents dinner where a Zippo(tm) lighter serves as the vehicle of a wholistic expose [we're all part of a bigger plan, everything's in total harmony etc.]Interesting. [heh]2. An evocation of Vietnam in a dialogue between Theo [Louis Garrel] and Matthew. Again, simplification at its best. Americans kill villagers vs. Americans are obligated to join the army. [Similar to Southpark's ""Drugs are bad...mkay?""]3. A critique of communism that would make Western cold war propaghandists stutter. (Mao as the director of a cast of ""extras"" etc.)
4. A vague 'respect' for Cinema [note the capital C] that materialises in the 3D pictionary the characters enjoy playing [in the form of ""guess the film"" etc]. So long for French film theory and critique [film theory was incedentally at its peak around that time];)Even if we disregard the setting (afterall, it could have been set in 80s Paris for all that matters) and focus on the story itself [the three lovers etc] we see the dynamic of this threesome numbed; just when their relationship is about to get out of hand Matthew makes sure to remind Isabelle [Eva Green] the merits of monogamous ""dating"" and sharing a glass of soda etc. 1/10",The Dreamers

I thought it was very slow and didn't have much dialogue. It showed plenty of nudity and I thought it was very confusing. Perhaps it is just not my type of movie. I only watched it since I know someone who really liked it and recommended it to me to watch. He said it was one of his favourites. I agree that the main character who was supposed to be an American did not sound like an American at all. It seemed like he had a foreign accent. Perhaps if I knew French history around that time period, it would make more sense to me. But if you're looking for a movie to sit back and relax and enjoy, I would definitely advise you to get something else to watch. This movie was depressing since I saw no bright or positive side to it. It made me fall asleep and I was waiting for something to happen in the movie, but nothing ever did happen.",The Dreamers
196,blueaznmonkey,Good direction of horrible content,3,20 April 2005,"I purchased ""The Dreamers"" shortly after seeing a preview for ""Kingdom of Heaven"" which is going to be released on May 6 this year. After noting the preview and it's obvious promise for a good movie, I noticed that one name just didn't ring a bell amidst Ridley Scott's all-star cast. Eva green.Through IMDb.com research I discovered that this move - ""The Dreamers"" was probably her only other notable film aside from the yet-to-be-released ""Heaven."" I decided to buy ""Dreamers"" in an effort to know Eva Green a little better. Well - you get to know her, as well as her two male companions - more than just a /little/ better. In fact, the three bear all in this content-less, mind-numbing film about the sixties counterculture in Paris.Reading official critics' reviews of the piece, I was expecting a fascinating, dreamlike portrayal of the era with deep emotions running through intelligent political discussion, passionate love-making, and heart-warming growth of relationships.What I got out of the film was much to the contrary. All political discussion is pointless (the main character's answer to the Vietnam War is that soldiers should listen to Jimmy Hendrix, not Clapton). Fabulous. The intimate scenes were so un-poetic that they were not even gratuitous - but meaningless. There was no passion, no anticipation, no emotion - it was like cupboard doors swinging against the pantry walls in every love scene- which were shot seemingly for shock value alone (""My goodness! those people are nude!""). And furthermore, there is no character development. You are thrown into a movie where the main characters divulge into sex and we are given no real explanation nor desire to watch any of those scenes.In the end, ""Dreamers"" is like a bad horror movie sequel that is centered around showing the nude human form through incestuous and dysfunctional relationships. The story is weaker than weak, and the movie only exists for its controversial imagery. Definitely not a Mark Twain-worthy movie, where controversy meets poetry and the two yield a marvelous piece of artwork.No - in actuality, I just finished watching it for the first time and I have a sick taste in my mouth, and an odd feeling in my gut. With the unholy brother-sister romance, the would-be philosophies, and the abrupt conclusion clouding this film, I am left disgusted. Bored and unimpressed after the first third of the movie, I can't give it a higher rating than just that - 3/10.Better luck next time Bertolucci, but movie goers want content.As for Eva Green - I will now consider ""Heaven"" to be your first real movie, definitely not ""Dreamers""...",The Dreamers
197,deelilian-1,Ingenious film-making? are you kidding me?,1,18 June 2005,"I want to comment on Mr. Roland's 'review' on this film that's pasted as a primary user comment on this site. What are you talking about, sir? Beautiful film making? Yes, Bertolucci has employed a few ingenious cinematography tricks, but the film is utterly pointless. Like someone who has too much to say (or too little), the message, the plot, the POINT of the entire film was lost, awash in masturbatory gestures (pardon the pun) of an aging, decaying, film maker. Mr. Roland, it is a shame that you sang such high praises to this motion picture, JUST BECAUSE the smörgåsbord of monumental scenes from classic masterpieces managed to pull a veil over your eyes, disguising the failure of this film as a piece of artwork, worthy of an audience's ATTENTION! wake up! As for me? that was '2-hour-period of my life that i would never get back'.",The Dreamers
198,killall777,Great....,10,5 May 2005,"I think this movie has to be one of the best I have ever seen. The way it depicts these teens, in this dreary house, doing all these taboo things, is genius. I watched this movie last night on a movie channel, very late, and I couldn't take my eye's away from it. Very great film.On a second note, I think this movie only got an NC-17 rating because of the way the twins were so Inces....They wouldn't let me use the world I want. Not many flicks show things that far into the so called, ""Macabre"" nature, and America apparently wasn't ready enough for it give it an R rating.I just find myself wanting to hang around these kids, wanting to run through museums, Wanting to talk about politics, wanting to eat dinner with there family. THAT is what make's this film great.",The Dreamers
199,datflyboy,great movie,10,20 May 2005,"this was a truly great movie, i enjoyed it from start to finish. i think it was very creative and well put together. as a very artistic free thinker i loved it. i know many may not get it though, and i know some may not see past the nudity and some of the content. i think these all tied in well with the story however. even more than this movie being great. the story was great as well. loved it! the characters in the movie were well rounded and the director should be credited for that. the political twist of the student riots also added a nice touch to the movie. the ending was the only thing i was disappointed in. it left me wanting more. i guess that isn't a bad thing however. i just wanted to know what went on to happen.",The Dreamers
200,Yousef_Sediq,Europe in America,10,25 September 2019,Its a fantastic experiment what Bertolucci did in this film .. cause what the film have from truely European cinema soul,The Dreamers
201,ddranginis,Dreamlike Bertolluci Vision against violence of '60s,10,17 June 2005,"I found the contra-positioning of the nearly feral innocence of the twin's and Mathew's characters set in the turbulence of 1960's Paris to be intriguing. Bertolucci sets up parallel environments of the ""revolution in the streets"" (effected by news-footage) and the coming of age or rebirth in the characters' lives. Innocence faces reality on both a cultural as well as a dramatic stage. The film's tenor and mood mirrors well its title of ""The Dreamers"" as it lulls viewers into a quiet though inwardly provocative dreamlike state. The sex scenes are tasteful and artistic as is the cinematography. Great film. It's a keeper.",The Dreamers
202,siebold,Excellent movie with superb actors,10,10 July 2005,"Yeserday I saw this film. I hoped it would transmit the feeling of the '68 and the film did. Not only the menage a trois but also the surrounding atmosphere of Paris and the streets have also been really fantastic.The sex-scenes of two of the three main-actors has been really realistic and often quoted as reality and not acting. From my point of view great parts of the film focuses on the relationship between the three characters which has the result that a great part of the ""real"" history has to be reduced.Otherwise displays the relationship of the three figures the feeling of the time and their participators.A really great movie of Bertoluci.Siebold",The Dreamers
203,fifdtx,Why did Isabelle Scream for Theo all of a sudden?,10,24 December 2017,"After watching the movie, a question is circling around my mind. I'm wondering the most about is, why did Isabelle start screaming for Theo all of a sudden while she was going to do it with Matthew? She even pretended like she didn't know Matthew at all, as like was a stranger! 
Does anybody know the answer?",The Dreamers
204,renatoborda,When to Be Young Was Very Sexy.,9,1 March 2018,"In the spring of 1968, three planets -- Sex, Politics and the Cinema -- came into alignment and exerted a gravitational pull on the status quo. In Paris, what began as a protest over the ouster of Henri Langlois, the legendary founder of the Cinematheque Francais, grew into a popular revolt that threatened to topple the government. There were barricades in the streets, firebombs, clashes with the police, a crisis of confidence. In a way that seems inexplicable today, the director Jean-Luc Godard and his films were at the center of the maelstrom. Other New Wave directors and the cinema in general seemed to act as the agitprop arm of the revolution.",The Dreamers
205,poojaganesh-02688,Oh! Eh.,7,18 September 2018,"The Dreamers is a story about three youngsters in the 60s France with cinema, sexuality and radicalism running through their veins. Matthew, an American exchange student is initially thrilled to have found Theo and Isabelle and is convinced about the passion for cinema they have. The siblings seduce Matthew into a life-like fantasy they have created for themselves dripped in decadence and disregard for a life carved of traditional notions of self, family, sexuality and nudity. Or as their father would say ""... that what provokes, not transforms"". They imitate art, failing to notice and sometimes even choosing to overlook the realities of a world of which the very same art is born. They do not understand that the magic, the passion and mysticism they live by is not very much separate from the passion in purpose, solidarity, faith, ambition... things they reject with such ignorance. And with ignorance comes fear; fear of confronting the new, the unfamiliar. Matthew. Matthew enters their world with questions and a curious mind. He thinks, appreciates and speculates.Witnessing Theo and Isa's relationship on his first night, he does not form a judgement on them on grounds of popular morality. He believes in their shared love for art and the sensibilities that are inherent in people who appreciate it. Which is why he is open to exploring the relationship they build, trying to make sense of it all, hoping to be a part of what he is willing to, but doesn't necessarily understand. Theo. Theo is the hollow image of the person Matthew thinks he is. Unlike Isabelle, Theo is not unaware of the follies he has built his life on. Everytime he converses with Matthew he understands what he knows deep inside but consciously chooses to ignore it, because it's easier. It's easier to look at the world through a window of privilege and status, and tailor your own twisted version of ""radicalism"" rather than confront your inability to contribute to or transform the society you so heedlessly abandon. Theo is threatened by Matthew because he sees this. In the scene were they argue about a certain ideology, Theo tries to strangle Matthew but feels drawn to him instead (Bertolucci really missed an opportunity to explore that dynamic) which is very different from the kind of attraction Isabelle has for Matthew. However his comfort and Isa's selfless companionship are too precious for him to gamble with. It could never be the three of them.Isabelle- Isabelle is the stake. She is an extension of Theo, an accomplice, but not his counterpart. She does not bother herself with Theo's philosophical ramblings nor does she hold any opinion of the world outside. She is unaware and is thus free of any internal conflict. Although she is an exhibit of Theo's influence, she is a traditionalist at heart. Isa's room, her shame at the thought of her parent's finding out, her being a virgin until she meets Matthew, show that Isa is not her brother. When Matthew comes into her life, Isa is caught between two halves. She has a chance of redemption. So why does she not take it?In what is a very poorly written third act, Theo and Isa break free from the impediment that tries to bring sense into their world; a world where they defy defy defy without reason, without thought, where passion is the product of madness and violence. Theo and Isa will always find a way back to themselves. With each other to back their delusions they will never have to face change. Matthew does not judge Theo and Isa for their choice to live a life, unconventional. But he judges their choice to turn a blind eye to what true passion and art stands for. ""A poem is a petition, a petition is a poem.""Filmmaking wise, I liked a few things, didn't like a few. For one, Eva Green (ugh, goddess) is clearly not a mature actress. Probably because this was her debut film. So well shot, aesthetically pleasing, three drop dead gorgeous human beings on screen. I am not culturally informed to give my opinion on the debates between Theo and Matthew, but they were so obviously the cringiest bits. A little style over substance issue, but I loved the style so no one's really complaining. It would take a lot to shovel out and read into things to construct character sketches in our minds. It would've been easier if we got to see them do something interesting instead. The ending was terribly rushed and actually very embarrassing to watch. I wish they'd explored the last act to it's full potential. But, such a lot of hate for this movie among cinephiles with people too eager to call it softcore, pretentious art house, pseudo intellectual hogwash... I really don't get it. I had fun! 7/10",The Dreamers
206,moltovivo,The Dreamers,9,25 December 2005,"A fabulously decadent return to a familiar French art-house theme. Think Jules et Jim and Zabriskie Point stuck in the city of dark lights with a little incestuous pinch of The Royal Tenenbaums.This is a film - yes, film not movie! - in which the subject matter plays a major role. The visuals (characters) are stunning, but no glitzy camera tricks or clichéd pans of the city (Paris). What a torture it must have been for the director to give a sweeping helicopter view of the riots but he managed it spectacularly, giving the film a more intimate, realistic and sensual feel.A lot of subtlety here. EG. The sister plans to kill all three of them by pumping gas into the room, but it takes a little while for the viewer to realise what she has in mind - and to not let a beautiful image be wasted on the slower among us the brother later says ""What's that strange smell?"" just to clarify, when the window is broken and she rushes to put back the gas hose.",The Dreamers
207,aindri,some magical moments carefully unfold through words,8,1 January 2006,"'dreamers' is one of those movies that makes you sit back and review it in your head.And though the controversial content of the film makes you wonder how others will receive it,for me some of the conversations in the film will remain immortal. its an insightful film,the characters portray their maturity, through age and conditioning in a beautiful way. Matthew, for one internalises his sensibilities to perfection and comes up with some very touching lines. specially the scene where he is first brought home by the twins and he is lost in his thoughts.. when he is disturbed by their father.Mathew, innocently brings out the story of isabella's lighter on the table and how it matches the pattern on the cloth, lengthwise and other fantastic geometric details that the 'cosmic world' unfolds amongst us. the universally acknowledged truth about how we love others' parents but our own, then again our grandparents seem the best. the film requires certain maturity from the viewer,and knowledge of cinema. i like the intercuts in the film which take you through actions in classic cinema, like godard's breathless and vera chitilova's daisies. i like the mild ambiguity in the film,it leaves behind the scent of France and its time of the riots. if i could describe the film in words,then it would be:floral( mostly isabella's diaphanous gown) red( the time she loses her virginity to matthew and the communist movement happening in Paris at that time) mouldy green(theo's corduroy jacket over his naked body,the interiors of their apartment). the transleucent overlap of skins on velvet and the film posters on the walls. its a beautiful film.for a 'film buff' its worth a watch.",The Dreamers
208,reelty10,Excellent Movie!,8,3 April 2006,This was an excellent movie in my opinion. The acting was so intriguing and the plot was great. I must say that some of it was weird but you have to love this movie. It is so different from anything you'll ever watch. I also have to add that the whole idea of this movie is great. How could someone come up with this? I just feel that everything about this movie pushes the envelope and it's always good to watch movies that are out of the ordinary. If there's any doubt in your mind about watching this movie....you should take get rid of it.The only reason I gave this movie an 8 is because I found it to be a bit confusing.,The Dreamers
