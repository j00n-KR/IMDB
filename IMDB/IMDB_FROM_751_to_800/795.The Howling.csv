0,TheLittleSongbird,A werewolf film with bite,7,10 January 2019,"Have an appreciation for horror and had been interested in 'The Howling' franchise for a while, with the first film being highly recommended. Also know that werewolf films have been done well on film, the obvious example being 'An American Werewolf in London' (over 35 years on and that film is still a classic). So decided to continue my ""watching and reviewing all films from horror franchises"" quest, and did so with 'The Howling' series.While not as good as 'An American Werewolf in London', not quite a classic and not without imperfections, 'The Howling' managed to be a highly effective and solid film of the genre and as an overall film. If asked whether it seems like it has held up well, my answer would be it seems as though it has. It's entertaining and has unsettling moments, while also being surprisingly well made and made by someone with a clear love for the genre with quite a number of affectionate touches. As far as 'The Howling' franchise goes, this is by far the best having found the follow-ups a very mixed bag. When it comes to films centred around werewolves, it's also one of the better ones.'The Howling' may take too long to get going, with a relatively uneventful first stretch, and is not without its dull spots.Regarding the acting, it is variable with Christopher Stone looking as though he was not very interested in his role or the film, his acting resembles that of sleep-walking. Dee Wallace fares much better, she is appealing and looks engaged but she is not without her not so good spots, particularly in some of her reactions.On the other hand, 'The Howling' does look great. There is a lot of atmosphere and it is very stylishly photographed, the secluded setting also adding a lot. In this regard though, faring best are the pretty amazing special effects/make-up. The score looms ominously very effectively and Joe Dante directs with an assured hand, never ill at ease or losing control of the material, and with clear affection of the genre.Standing out too are the sharp and witty script, a very successful attempt at turning genre cliches on their heads and doing things fresh with them and some quite decent characters that don't bore or annoy, some named after horror incons such as Freddie Francis and Terrence Fisher. In particularly the second half when things do properly get going, there is a suspenseful and unsettling atmosphere and actually did think there were some nicely timed scares. The werewolf transformations are highly imaginative and look great even today. Although the acting is variable, the horror stalwarts involved fare very well, they are accomplished and clearly know what they were doing. John Carradine is the clear standout here.In conclusion, solid atmospheric fun with bite. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Howling
1,Leofwine_draca,One of the most knowing - and fun - modern werewolf movies,6,2 August 2016,"This movie did for werewolves what PIRANHA did for, er, fish...it treated the monsters in a bloody, but not over the top, way. It's a masterful blend of comedy and horror, mixing in the chills and laughs at equal measure. The great thing about watching Joe Dante films is the amount of in-jokes you'll find in them. Even if the film is bad, you'll still enjoy yourself trying to spot all the cameos and references to older horror films. Luckily, this film is good, so there's a lot going on to enjoy. Made in the early 1980s, this was one of the two big werewolf films of the time, the other being AN American WEREWOLF IN London. Both films were famed for their state-of-the-art special effects. I think the effects here have the edge, slightly, as there are far more of them. Artificial bladders and a lot of rubber are used to create the werewolves, which are very effective (if slightly comedic).While the plot is not particularly strong, it really sits in the background while the jokes and horror moments come thick and fast. The acting is average, but benefits from the veteran presence of Patrick Macnee, Kevin McCarthy (who starred in Dante's earlier PIRANHA) and John Carradine, in one of his last well-known film roles (he died 7 years later in obscurity). Carradine is particularly pleasing as the hunter who has a classic line; ""You can't tame what's meant to be wild, Doc. It ain't natural!"" The special effects are of course, excellent, and Dick Miller is on hand, as usual, to give support. Roger Corman and Forrest J Ackerman turn up in classic cameos, and some of the characters are named after directors of famous horror films (Freddie Francis, Terence Fisher). We also get to see a clip of THE WOLF MAN on TV. Joe Dante, who directed, is obviously such a fan of the older horrors that it makes his films shine. One of the most knowing of modern werewolf films.",The Howling
2,SnoopyStyle,Dee Wallace rules,7,16 October 2013,"TV reporter Karen White (Dee Wallace) is on a sting for serial killer Eddie. He leads her to a backroom peepshow in the red lights district. She's attacked but rescued by a couple of cops. She's haunted by the attack and goes to a retreat with her husband Bill (real life husband Christopher Stone). Meanwhile Karen's colleagues researching Eddie find disturbing things about the serial killer.I love the start. It's a powerful move to have the lead in danger right away. Dee Wallace is a strong actress and she's amazing in this. If anything, this movie needs more Dee. She's a simple victim here. It's a minor mistake to have the investigating separated from the main character. It would be more suspenseful to have Karen White do the investigating.The special effects are passable for the times. 'An American Werewolf in London(1981)' is far superior in the transformation. The ultimate final state looks good. The animatronics and the costumes look believable. The problem maybe that the Robert Picardo transformation was too extended. More isn't always better. They should pick the best parts and let the audience imagine the rest.",The Howling
3,Prismark10,American werewolves in America,5,31 October 2018,"Two notable werewolf films were released in 1981. American Werewolf in London became an instant classic. The Howling attracted a more cultish following.Directed by Joe Dante, The Howling includes sly references to previous werewolf films and his regular stock of actors such as Kevin McCarthy, Robert Picardo and Dick Miller.It starts off with television reporter Karen White (Dee Wallace) looking for a shady serial killer called Eddie in the seedy part of the city who has been taunting her. Karen gets attacked by him at the back of a sex shop but two cops shoot the assailant dead.Karen is haunted by what she saw of the killer and is sent to a remote mountain retreat run by Dr Wagner. However the people in the country keep back a transformative secret. Meanwhile Karen's colleagues find out something disturbing about Eddie that also links him to the same area that Karen and her husband has gone to.The film lacks Dante's dark humour. It starts off as a gritty dirty thriller before the werewolf story kicks in.The special effects go from pretty good to bad as we get some terrible animated scenes of wolves. Dee Wallace is just there to be a scream queen, I think her part should had been bolder.",The Howling
4,claudio_carvalho,One of the Three Best Movies About Werewolves of the 80's,8,1 December 2004,"In a red light district, the TV news reporter and anchor Karen White (Dee Wallace) is bugged by the police, investigating the serial killer called Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo), who is molesting her through phone calls. There are some troubles with the transmission and the police officers lose their track. She stays alone with Eddie for a while in a peep-show cabin, when two policemen find them and shoot Eddie. Karen becomes emotionally disturbed and loses her memory, and after a consultation with Dr. George Wagner (Patrick Macnee), she is advised to withdraw to a colony kept by Dr. Wagner in the countryside. Karen travels with her husband Bill (Christopher Stone), and she realizes the place is a nest of werewolves. 'The Howling' is one of the three best movies about werewolves, coincidently all of them made in the 80's: John Landis's 'An American Werewolf in London' (1981) and Neil Jordan's 'The Company of Wolves' (1984). 'The Howling' is a classic in the genre, with magnificent special effects and make-up, and an excellent story. I bought the recently released Brazilian DVD, and unfortunately there are no extras. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Grito de Horror' ('Scream of Horror')Note: On 22 July 2013, I saw this movie again on an imported DVD full of extras.",The Howling
5,mark.waltz,"It takes patience, but entirely worth it!",8,6 October 2021,"You have to wait a good 45 minutes before the first werewolf to appear, but it is definitely worth the wait. Then when you begin to see the transition of one of the residents of the small community into a werewolf, it all comes together, and it is great horrific stuff. Dee Wallace is a Los Angeles journalist suffering from the trauma of a horrific encounter while on a story and goes to rest with husband Christopher Stone in the country where her social circle is revealed to be hiding their secret lives as werewolves. Wallace finds out the hard way, and the viewer finds a few chills during that time.Yes, some of the visuals are clearly graphic, but the subtlety of the film makes it as good as the original werewolf movies and that makes this a classic of the genre. Horror film veteran John Carradine, in one of his thousand horror movies, is memorable in his first scene as a drunken residents threatening suicide by jumping into a fire, yet later revealed to be one of them toothy blood thirsty creatures. You've also got Slim Pickens, Patrick McNee, Margie Impert as the local nymphomaniac, and as Stone's boss, Kevin Mccarthy. The film is filled with tension, especially in the second half, and I found it a completely enjoyable film with a few incredible ""wow!"" moments.",The Howling
6,gavin6942,A Very Subtle Film Whose Subtlety Was Lost On Me,5,8 October 2006,"During a werewolf feature night, I rented ""The Howling"" hoping to be exposed to one of the horror classics in a very positive way. Since I enjoyed Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"", ""Innerspace"" and ""Homecoming"", I figured this would be an easy task. But I was more bored than anything.The story begins with a woman working undercover who is attacked in a booth at an adult store. She and her husband leave the area, only to enter into a den of werewolves.The film had some big problems for me. The biggest being that as far as horror films go, this one lacked a lot of things one expects from horror. The werewolves do not appear until much later in the film, leaving more than the first half for some other story that seemed to me to have very little connection to the horror theme (though I admit I did not pay as close attention as I probably should have).The other big problem is that I did not know the film would be laced with subtle horror homages. The film ""Slither"" had many horror homages, but was very enjoyable even without them. This film seems to rely heavily on the audience getting the in-jokes I missed. I didn't notice the characters were named for actors who were in werewolf movies. I didn't see the photo of Lon Chaney. I didn't notice the copy of the book ""Howl"". And the man who digs for change (Roger Corman), was unrecognizable to me (unfortunately and rather ironically, as I consider Corman the greatest horror director of all time). Catching these things would have made me squeal in delight.The film had good moments. A passionately love scene was well-done. Early on we also see a violent porn film, which I think made the film more gritty and disturbing than many horror films of its time. And there is a werewolf transformation sequence that is very long and very heavy on the special effects (before the days of CGI). The werewolves in general looked great, not unlike the ones in ""Dog Soldiers"" but without the stilts.I guess I expected more humor from Joe Dante, but this film definitely deserves a second chance from me. Until that time, I give the film a middle of the road rating: neither good or bad.",The Howling
7,lee_eisenberg,E.T. phone wolves...,10,30 March 2006,"Right before she played the mother of a boy who befriends a certain alien, Dee Wallace played reporter Karen White, who after an accident gets sent to a rehabilitation center inhabited by werewolves. It sounds like a simple plot, but ""The Howling"" is a Joe Dante movie, and Dante always knows how to make these things really neat. Since this is a Joe Dante movie, Dick Miller, Kevin McCarthy, and Robert Picardo all make appearances. Also making a brief appearance is John Sayles, as the morgue director. I guess that as long as there are stories of werewolves, there'll be plenty of movies to make about them.So order it rare...",The Howling
8,jboothmillard,The Howling,7,14 August 2009,"I must admit firstly that I didn't pay the fullest attention for the first twenty to thirty minutes, until it really got thrilling and gruesome, that is when it got good, from director Joe Dante. Basically serial killer Eddie Quist (Star Trek: Voyager's Robert Picardo) is on the loose, and after nearly being killed by him in an adult video store, news reporter Karen White (E.T.'s Dee Wallace) is told to take a vacation. She discovers Eddie was killed in the forest by the cops, and that he was part of a small community, so she hangs around there with husband R. William 'Bill' Neill (Christopher Stone). This of course if the big mistake, and all events that have happened previously make sense, because Eddie was part of a pack of werewolves, and obviously anyone who goes near them will be either torn to shreds or become one of them. Also starring Patrick Macnee as Dr. George Waggner, Dennis Dugan as Chris, John Carradine as Erle Kenton, Slim Pickens as Sam Newfield, Elisabeth Brooks as Marsha Quist and Gremlins' Dick Miller as Walter Paisley. I think it was as soon as I saw the transformation scene that I was fixed, and as more and more werewolves the horror really picks up. I have to say though it is meant to be a comedy horror, I only giggled at one moment, and it was near the end, but never mind, it's still worth a go. Very good!",The Howling
9,Woodyanders,Terrific 80's werewolf horror winner,9,16 March 2017,"Traumatized news anchor Karen White (a strong and sympathetic performance by Dee Wallace) goes to a remote rural retreat for therapy and recovery that turns out to be a front for a werewolf colony.Director Joe Dante keeps the engrossing and entertaining story moving along at a zippy pace, crafts a nicely spooky atmosphere, and provides a wealth of witty in-jokes. The clever script by John Sayles and Terrence H. Winkless pokes wickedly amusing fun at pretentious self-help groups, glib pop psychology, and the sensation-driven media. (Sayles also has a hilarious cameo as a talkative morgue attendant.) The fabulous cast helps a lot: Patrick Macnee does supremely smooth work as folksy shrink Dr. George Wagner, gorgeous brunette Elisabeth Brooks burns up the screen with her sultry portrayal of alluring and uninhibited vixen Marsha Quist (her campfire nude scene rates as one of the single most hot moments in an early 80's horror movie), and Robert Picardo cranks the skin-crawling creep factor up to eleven as vicious serial killer Eddie Quist plus there are fine contributions from Christopher Stone as Karen's easygoing husband Bill, Dennis Dugan as the nerdy Chris Halloran, Belinda Balaski as the spunky Terry Fisher, Slim Pickens as the amiable Sheriff Sam Newfield, Kevin McCarthy as tough boss Freddie Francis, John Carradine as crazy old coot Erle Kenton, and Dick Miller as feisty occult bookstore owner Walter Paisley. Rob Bottin's fearsome werewolves and elaborate transformation set pieces are still impressive and persuasive. Kudos are also for John Hora's moody cinematography and Pino Donaggio's spirited shivery score. Worthy of its cult classic status.",The Howling
10,BA_Harrison,Shapeshifting fun.,7,8 July 2009,"After a near fatal encounter with a serial killer, intrepid TV reporter Karen White (Dee Wallace) travels to a remote coastal colony in order to recuperate, but is horrified to discover that the other residents are werewolves.Almost three decades after they first hit the silver screen, An American Werewolf in London and The Howling still have horror fans debating over which is the better werewolf film. Permit me, if you will, to put an end to all of the petty squabbling: American Werewolf kicks The Howling's hairy butt and anyone who disagrees doesn't know jack about horror! Not that I don't like The Howling—au contraire, I'm a big fan of Joe Dante's tongue-in-cheek lycanthrope flick—but to compare the two is ludicrous: Landis' movie has the better script, more likable characters, Nazi monsters, unparallelled transformation effects (that aren't sneakily hidden by shadows), and best of all, it has Jenny Agutter getting fruity in a shower! The Howling is totally devoid of naked Agutter. Case closed.Of course, even though Dante's film cannot hold a candle to Landis' superior classic, it's still well worth checking out: an excellent cast (including John Carradine, Dante regular Dick Miller, Patrick Macnee, Robert Picardo, and Kevin McCarthy) give decent performances (although Dee Wallace should've taken a leaf out of Jenny's book and stripped off!); there's plenty of creepy goings-on in a fog shrouded forest; the make-up effects, by Rob Bottin, are mostly impressive (just a couple of weak models and a few too many bladder effects let things down a tad); and the whole shebang has a wonderful, twisted fairytale atmosphere that really helps to deliver the chills.A rather silly ending, in which Wallace turns into the Shaggy DA in front of her disbelieving TV audience, sadly ends proceedings on a weak note, but if you've already seen American Werewolf a million times, and really cannot face watching Jenny Agutter getting all wet and steamy again (extremely unlikely, I know), then The Howling should make a reasonable alternative.",The Howling
11,paul_haakonsen,An extraordinary werewolf movie...,7,15 July 2019,"I think this is the second time I've seen ""The Howling"", and finally getting around to making a review of it.Despite this movie being from 1981, then it is still a werewolf movie that packs a punch even in mid-2019. Sure, the special effects are weathered and wearing signs of early 1980s, but when you keep that in mind, then the special effects in ""The Howling"" were actually quite phenomenal for a movie from 1981.One thing that didn't really make much sense was the scene where Karen White (played by Dee Wallace) came up close and personal, face to face, with a man changing into werewolf. Sure, I get that the scene was there for the audience to enjoy the transformation scene from man to beast, and for the special effects team to showcase their craft. But the scene took 3 minutes, and all the while Karen White just stood a foot from the transforming man and gawked at him, when she could have managed to escape and gotten a relatively good head start. But no, she just stood there and watched for a whole 3 minutes - yeah, that makes perfect sense.The storyline in ""The Howling"" is straight forward, and it is so simple that you can just lean back in your seating of choice and enjoy the movie. I don't really recall the movie actually being as enjoyable as it turned out to be, now that I watched it again in mid-2019. And for a werewolf movie, then ""The Howling"" really is a definitive MUST watch.The was quite an impressive cast of actors and actresses in ""The Howling"", many of which might have had small roles, but still were familiar faces; such as Kevin McCarthy, Patrick Macnee, Slim Pickens, Robert Picardo and Dick Miller. Needless to say that the movie was so well carried by Dee Wallace.I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Howling"" and it turned out actually better than I remembered it. If you haven't already seen this werewolf classic from 1981 by director Joe Dante, then you should definitely take the time to do so if you are given the chance.",The Howling
12,Quinoa1984,"sometimes funny, often scary wolf movie with amazing make-up fx",8,13 October 2009,"The Howling and An American Werewolf in London were both released in 1981, and both include some of the finest werewolf make-up and special effects one will see in any horror movie. This today still I note this, that's how impressive both films are at it (and indeed Rick Baker worked on this one for a short while before transitioning over to 'London'). Fans and admirers can argue about the merits or flaws in each film - neither one is entirely perfect - but they are both solid films. In the case of Joe Dante's effort, with the help of co-screenwriter John Sayles, his film mostly trumps comedy for horror. This isn't to say that little moments of hilarity or just random absurdity sprout up from time to time. He creates with his crew such an immediate effect of atmosphere that everything else that comes with it works that much better. It's a creepy little movie.It's about a newscaster (Dee Wallace) who got a kind of close encounter with a serial killer, whom she tracked down for a story to a porno shop and who nearly killed her until the cops come and shoot the man/thing. But then she keeps getting visions of what she saw- or didn't see- and is told by her doctor to go up to ""The Colony"", to relax for a couple of weeks and sit in on some therapy sessions with other people who experienced a similar occurrence. She also goes with her husband, which for him turns out not so well as he's attacked at night by a wolf... which, in turn, makes him one. What we see, and what makes for a nice twist on the conventions of werewolf movies, is that the people don't need to wait for dark or even a full moon to transform, and it's pretty hard to kill it without silver (that last convention still sticks, though to a great result late in the film).What unfolds at this ""Colony"", and in the newscaster's friends' search to find out more about these werewolves and how to kill them, is intriguing stuff, and it's filmed by Dante often with a clever knack for shifting between satire and serious horror. There's a scene at a bonfire on a beach when Karen first comes to the Colony, and we see an old man muttering to himself that he can't go on and threatens to do himself in. This scene is almost funny just by how the guy playing the old man acts and speaks, but it's not a funny scene in the slightest. And when it comes time for Dante and his main make-up guy Rob Bottin (one year before working on The Thing) get to showing what these creatures look like, it's spine-tingling and sometimes bizarre (i.e. werewolf sex scene).If it suffers from anything it's sometimes an almost too-much reliance on in-jokes (sometimes it works like with the Big Bad Wolf cartoon on TV, but a copy of Howl on a desk is a little much), and not the firmest control of the narrative early on in the film (the first ten minutes seem sort of shaky until Karen gets into the porno store). When it gets to the Colony it sticks to being weird and terrifying, and for all of its acting being over the top (Slim Pickens) or flat (Dee Wallace) what counts is its tone and mood. It's more self-conscious about its genre than parody, and it displays how wonderful a filmmaker Joe Dante was right before his big hit with Gremlins.",The Howling
13,tavm,Joe Dante's The Howling has plenty of scares throughout,8,20 April 2007,"Earlier this week, I saw An American Werewolf in London in its entirety for the first time in my life. Now I just saw another werewolf movie from 1981 from beginning to end in my first viewing: The Howling. With direction from Joe Dante and a script co-written by John Sayles, this flick was almost as awesome as the John Landis' England-based comedy-horror pic. Dee Wallace, who would later be better known as the mother in E.T., is fine as the television reporter who is recovering from an unpleasant encounter with a serial killer as she and her husband (Christopher Stone) take in a retreat in the woods with a community waiting there for them. Many effective werewolf transformation scenes abound although some may take so long that you want to laugh after a while. Still, good support from Robert Picardo, Dennis Dugan, Kevin McCarthy, Slim Pickens, Patrick Macnee, John Carradine, and in cameos, Roger Corman, Sayles, Forrest J. Ackerman, and frequent Dante regular Dick Miller as Walter Paisley, a name he first used in Corman's A Bucket of Blood. Great use of scares throughout up to the ironic finale. So give The Howling a try with maybe An American Werewolf in London as its second feature...P.S. Like AWIL, there's references to The Wolf Man with clips shown on a television screen and a picture of Lon Chaney, Jr. in a cabin somewhere.",The Howling
14,BandSAboutMovies,Near perfect,9,21 October 2017,"The Howling is a movie in love with movies. Watching it, one comes away with the purest of joy, a celebration of past horror movies to come without ever talking down on the past, like worse movies such as Scream. In a year that also gave us the seminal An American Werewolf in London and the near forgotten Wolfen, it still stands out as something unique and different while whore heartedly embracing the past.In Los Angeles, KDHB news anchor Karen White (Dee Wallace, The Hills Have Eyes, E.T., Cujo, Critters, Popcorn, The House of the Devil) has become he story, as she's being stalked by Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo, Legend, The 'Burbs, Innerspace), a serial killer who leaves behind a smiley face as his calling card. Cooperating with the police, she becomes part of a sting operation to catch him inside a scummy, scuzzy, 70s porn theater. He forces her to watch a video of him raping and killing a girl, then makes her turn to face him. Whatever she see freaks her out so badly, she suffers from amnesia. Just before Quist can kill her, the police open fire, killing him.Karen's therapist, Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee, John Steed from The Avengers) has a private resort named The Colony where he sends his patients. She and Bill, her husband, schedule a visit and meet all manner of insane folks, like Erle Kenton (John Carradine, star of more movies than this article will ever be able to catalogue), an old man who keeps yelling that he wants to die, and Marsha Quist, a sex maniac who tries to seduce Karen's husband. While trying to run away, a wolf attacks him.Karen's had enough, so she calls in her friend Terri (Belinda Balaski, who has appeared in nearly every one of director Joe Dante's movies), who connected Eddie Quist to The Colony (me, I would have guessed that since his sister is there).Read more at bandsaboutmovies.com/2017/08/04/the-howling-1981",The Howling
15,Coventry,You can't tame what's meant to be wild!,8,11 November 2004,"Joe Dante's The Howling is a superb film handling about the coolest creatures in the horror field: Werewolves!! Unfortunately, this sub-genre isn't really packed with masterpieces so that's an extra reason to particularly praise this one. Plot, screenplay and acting are terrific! The Howling contains several very creepy and atmospheric moments while the special effects and the make-up are outstanding (that transmutation scene!!). It may look like this film starts out a little slow and out of its horror-field but you'll soon forget about this during the second half of the movie. And, after witnessing the overwhelming finale, I'm pretty sure you'll regard this like a true genre-highlight. The Howling can depend on a clever crew and a more than devoted cast. Dee Wallace is quite impressive in her role of Karen White. She's a journalist suffering from a trauma after she nearly got raped and killed during an undercover assignment for the TV-news. As some form of therapy, she and her husband Bill join a bizarre spiritual movement called 'The Colony'. Karen soon gets the impression that something is not quite right in this group and that several members have animal characteristics. Other than a very entertaining and well-elaborated film, The Howling also is a purely ingenious tribute to other genre-classics. Joe Dante brings homage to Universal Pictures (The Wolf Man, WereWolf of London) as well as too Hammer Studios (Curse of the Werewolf) and a whole lot of titles directed by his mentor, Roger Corman. This simply is an excellent film, period. Over twenty years old by now but it still looks fresh and adequate. It has everything: tension, atmosphere, a bit of gore and a grim sense of humor. If you're interested in purchasing all the fundamental films that made the horror genrethen add the Howling to your list!",The Howling

17,hitchcockthelegend,"A secret society exists, and is living among all of us. They are neither people nor animals, but something in-between.",9,2 November 2015,"In the name of good television, newswoman Karen White (Dee Wallace) forms a bond with serial killer Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo). But when the meeting of the two arrives, it nearly proves fatal and damages Karen psychologically. Her psychologist recommends that she spend some time with her husband out at a remote convalescence resort, but once there it appears all is not as it seems.A truly great Werewolf movie, one of the best in fact, The Howling - in some eyes - has lost some of its bite over the years due to countless sequels and imitators, but its importance never dims. It often gets forgotten that The Howling changed the werewolf DNA for the better, it invented its own hairy beast as it were, refusing to copy past treasures from the olde classic era. But director Joe Dante shows the utmost respect to those who had previously eaten at the Lycan table, naming many of the characters in his film after directors of Werewolf movies. Nice.Another thing forgotten, due in no part to the release of An American Werewolf in London later in the year, is that Dante's movie often has tongue in bloody cheek. It is happy to be a parody of the sub-genre of horror it loves, while some of the comedy visuals are deliciously and knowingly dry. But this is a horror film after all, and it so delivers in spades the frights and nervous tremors, even sexing things up as well. These Werewolves are completely bestial, and in human form enjoy having their secret other halves. This is just a colony at the moment but domination of all humans is most definitely appealing and on the agenda.Horror fans will sometimes stumble across a debate about effects wizards Rob Bottin and Rick Baker, who is best? It really doesn't matter, both are geniuses of their craft. Bottin is in the chair here, while Baker served as a consultant before doing his thing on An American Werewolf in London. The transformation sequences are superb and still hold up today as brilliant craft work, no CGI cheap tactics here. No sir. The Howling is scary, sexy and funny, and knowing Dante - maybe even political. A joyous Werewolf film whose impact on horror should always be respected. 9/10",The Howling
18,Theo Robertson,Will Probably Appeal To Werewolf Fans MoreThan Casual Viewers,6,22 May 2005,"This is a highly regarded movie amongst werewolf fans but I've never been overly impressed by it . I was disappointed by THE HOWLING after seeing it on video in the early 1980s and the fact that I saw AN American WEREWOLF IN London shortly before seeing this does the movie little favour either I think the problem lies in John Sayles screenplay . Go getting journalist ( strange how all journalists in movies are noble crusaders . Real life is entirely different ) Karen White is attacked by a serial killer narrowly surviving and goes off to a rural commune to recuperate . The audience instantly know who these people really are and whats going to happen next . It's not so much telegraphing a screenplay , it's more like making a terribly predictable one . The only reason I wrote a spoiler warning to this review was to guard my back but this is probably unnecessary since it's revealed fairly early on that the people living there are indeed werewolves so there's little in the way of surprises THE HOWLING isn't a total loss because the make up and transformation effects are well done and Patrick Macnee gives a touching performance as Dr George Waggner and there's a really scary moment featuring Eddie the serial killer when he reveals himself to the hero . But despite all this the movie is doubly disappointing when you realise director Joe Dante and screenwriter John Sayles were responsible for PIRANAHA a couple of years before , one of the most entertaining tongue in cheek horror movies ever made . With THE HOWLING they fall back on naming characters after directors who have made werewolf movies and use post modernist dialogue pointing out that a corpse doesn't get up and walk out of a morgue which isn't all that clever or witty",The Howling
19,Hey_Sweden,"""You can't tame what's meant to be wild, Doc. It ain't natural.""",8,29 July 2012,"The werewolf genre had laid dormant for a while, to be successfully and memorably revived by this film and ""An American Werewolf in London"" in 1981. Using the Gary Brandner novel as its basis, it goes off in interesting, unexpected, and intelligent directions, adding fascinating layers to the story. Screenplay credit is given to John Sayles and Terence H. Winkless, with Joe Dante, one of many graduates of the Roger Corman school of filmmaking, in the directors' chair.The story has a prominent TV newscaster, Karen White (Dee Wallace, in her first top-billed feature film role) traumatized by the attack of a serial killer (in a porno movie booth, no less) and sent to the woodsy encounter group retreat run by eminent psychiatrist Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee). What Karen doesn't know is that her attacker, Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo, in a hell of a film debut) and virtually everybody at the retreat is a werewolf.Of course, going by the first 40 minutes or so of this film, one may not know it's a werewolf film, which is one of its strengths, as it builds its mystery. Going against the grain of classic werewolf films, Sayles, Winkless, and Dante don't portray their werewolves as tragic victims but evil, primal beings that would rather be adhering to werewolf tradition and feasting on their human counterparts. In Sayles' own words, these are monsters that completely unleash their Id. In addition to its genuine scares and suspense, the film also has an incredible self aware humour about itself - without resorting to cracking jokes - with many of the characters named after men who directed werewolf films. There are other wolf references as well - Wolf brand chili, a copy of Allen Ginsburg's ""Howl"", etc. The film is much like ""American Werewolf"" in the way that it can have one laughing while functioning as a true horror film.The cast is just amazing; Wallace and Belinda Balaski are lovely and appealing as always (with Balaski figuring in what is one of the major set pieces of the film), and Dennis Dugan, Christopher Stone (Wallaces' husband), Kevin McCarthy, John Carradine, Slim Pickens, Picardo, Noble Willingham, James Murtaugh, and Kenneth Tobey adding to the fun with their appearances. Co-star Elisabeth Brooks is extremely alluring as nasty temptress Marsha. Sayles himself and the legendary Dick Miller offer side splitting cameo performances, and Corman himself turns up as a man at a phone booth.A very young Rob Bottin, recommended for this project by his mentor Rick Baker, supervises the stunning makeup and creature effects; both men can take credit for two very impressive man into werewolf transformations in their respective films. The werewolves here are bipedal, but more wolf than man and pretty terrifying. Wonderful music by Pino Donaggio, typically excellent prop work by art director Robert A. Burns, and ingenious closing credits (with a little bonus after said credits) all also combine to make this enjoyable and worth discovering or revisiting.Followed by seven (to date) inferior sequels.In conclusion, it's hard not to be amused by any film that includes the hilarious quip, ""Screw this 'channel your energies' crap!""Eight out of 10.",The Howling
20,Doylenf,Make-up: 10--Script: 3--Acting: 3...,5,1 February 2008,"Only until midway through THE HOWLING is there any real hint of danger or excitement in the werewolf scheme of things. Up until then, we have pretty blonde DEE WALLACE advised to seek rest and relaxation by a doctor (PATRICK MACNEE) who thinks a trip to a country retreat will soothe her nerves.Of course, what he neglects to tell her is that the resort is creeping with werewolves and she's a newspaper woman who will soon have quite a scoop for her target audience of TV viewers. We know that she'll have a scoop because at the end of this messy horror film, the final horror twist is the one we suspected would be pulled at the last minute.DEE WALLACE tries to look alarmed in her big close-up reaction shots but looks as though she's just having a bad day away from the office even when a werewolf is breathing down her neck. PATRICK MACNEE does nothing to make us think he's doing anything more than wasting his time in this poorly constructed exploitation film for horror fans, and JOHN CARRADINE is almost unrecognizable as one of the foremost character actors of movies during the '30s, '40s and '50s.Believe me, you have better things to do with your time than expect anything more than some good glimpses of Rick Baker's expertise with make-up for the transformation scenes. This is one poor excuse for a horror film and doesn't set any standards for things to come in this genre.",The Howling
21,preppy-3,An almost classic,8,19 February 2002,"TV newswoman Karen White (Dee Wallace) is traumatized by a meeting with a psycho killer in a porno shop. A pompous doctor, George Waggner (Patrick Macnee!), invites her to ""The Colony""--a woodland clinic of his to help her get over the shock. Karen and her husband Bill (Christopher Stone) go...unaware that there are wolves roaming around...This is a full throttle horror-comedy with an emphasis on the comedy. It's almost as good as ""American Werewolf in London"". It's fun, has sharp dialogue and constant wolf references (a copy of the book ""Howl"" is seen on a desk; people watch ""The Big Bad Wolf"" and ""The Wolf Man"" on TV). Also The Colony itself is just gorgeous and beautifully atmospheric. In the day it's clear and bright--at night the fog rolls in and it becomes really creepy. Also it playfully injects horror clichés in the movie (I got a big kick out of the sequence in which Karen and a friend get lost in the woods, their flashlight goes out and there's howling in the distance...). It's ALMOST a classic.The problems are many, but the main one is that the film isn't scary--when you see the werewolves they look pretty pathetic. This is supposed to be (partially) a HORROR film--it doesn't help when the main monsters look silly. The transformation scenes look lousy too--but this was over 20 years ago. The story is sort of vague (why does Dr. Waggner invite her to the colony in the first place? It puts her in danger!) and there are plenty of dead spots. It seems too long and it's only 90 minutes! Also Wallace and Stone are not good actors--Wallace's reaction to finding a dead, bloody body is very poor and Stone sleepwalks through his role (although he does very well at a campfire sequence--you'll know it when you see it).So, it has great atmosphere, some very good laughs, John Carradine and some very good cameos (Dick Miller, Roger Corman and Forrest J. Ackerman holding a copy of his magazine ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"") but it's VERY light and insubstantial--you want to see a real movie after this. Nevertheless, it's worth seeing but not the classic it could have been.",The Howling
22,poolandrews,"Overrated Werewolf film, average at best as far as I'm concerned.",5,16 January 2005,"T.V. newswoman Karen Stone (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) has been contacted by and agreed to have a private meeting with a wanted L.A. serial killer Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo), she decides to use herself as bait to trap him with the police's help. Things don't go according to plan however. Before receiving a phone call from Quist in a public call box to let her know where to go and meet him her electronic equipment fails and the monitoring police lose track of her. Quist tells Karen to go to a porno shop and wait in a booth in the back. Violent pornography plays on a screen as Karen is attacked from behind. Two policemen (Kenneth Toby and Steve Nevil), having managed to re-locate Karen, burst in and shoot Eddie dead. Karen is traumatised by the event and cannot remember parts of it and decides to visit Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee) who did a profile on Quist and was recently a guest on her T.V. programme. He suggests that she and her husband William 'Bill' Neil (Dee Wallace-Stones real life husband Christopher Stone) take a break from their careers and visit the secluded retreat he has set-up that is known as the 'Colony'. They agree and head off to the Colony which is situated on the California coast. At night Karen begins to hear an eerie howling noise. Meanwhile two of Karen's journalist friends and colleagues, Terry (Belinda Balaski) and Chris (Dennis Dugan) locate Quist's apartment and find some very strange drawings of half men half wolf creatures. They investigate further and discover that Quist's body has disappeared from the morgue, eventually the trail leads them to the Colony. After Bill has just rejected the advances of Marsha (Elizabeth Brooks) he is attacked by a large unknown and extremely aggressive animal. Soon everything is revealed and Karen finds out the sinister truth behind the howling noises, who Eddie Quist really is and the real purpose of why the 'Colony' was created. Directed by Joe Dante I was very disappointed by this highly thought of film, I just can't get that excited about it. The script by John Sayles and Terence H. Winkless based on the Novel by Gary Brandner is very slow to start and is full of in-jokes and references. It picks up a little for the last half an hour or so but overall I just wasn't particularly interested in anyone or anything by this point. Why is it that a werewolf can punch through a car roof but can't escape from an old wooden barn while it's burning down? The one thing this film does have going for it is some excellent special make-up effects from Rob Bottin and his team, Rick Baker who did the equally excellent effects for An American Werewolf in London (1981) has a credit as consultant too. The transformation scenes are impressive although there isn't a lot of blood or gore, in fact I can't really remember any. There is someone with half their face burnt off with acid and a chopped off arm and that's about it, but it's definitely the transformations that steal the special make-up effects show. There is a scene where two people start to turn into werewolves as they have sex, which is kinky I guess. It's generally well made and looks OK. The acting is fine and there are a few familiar faces in it, there's an extremely old looking John Carradine who can barely walk, Slim Pickens as the local Sheriff, Dick Miller plus director Roger Corman and screenwriter John Sayles also have small cameo's. This is also the only film that has the closing credits running over a shot of a burger being cooked on a grill, at least I think it is. Generally quite slow but there are a few good sequences in here if you stick it out to the end. Not too bad, but not brilliant either.",The Howling

Her therapist Dr. George Waggner (an excellent Patrick Macnee) send her and her husband (Christopher Stone) to recuperate at a secluded California resort called The Colony. What Karen and her husband don't know is that The Colony is, in fact, a werewolf commune.Joe Dante's quirky direction is terrific. He fills the screen full of genre in-jokes and references, adding an extra layer for fans of werewolf movies to enjoy. The script comes from John Sayles and is witty and exciting with a little bit of everything thrown in. Humor, horror, mystery, sex, romance, action -- I'm not saying the film knocks it out of the park on every front, but at least it's in there swinging. Makeup effects artist Rob Bottin outdid himself on this one. The special effects are excellent. The transformation effects in movies like this and An American Werewolf in London have yet to be surpassed, despite all the CGI crap we get today.In addition to Wallace, Stone, Picardo, and Macnee, Joe Dante has assembled a fun cast of recognizable faces to movie fans. Dick Miller, John Carradine, Slim Pickens, Kenneth Tobey, and Kevin McCarthy all appear as well as several cameos from others. But a special mention should go to two actors who, in most reviews I've read, don't get enough praise. Dennis Dugan and Belinda Balaski as Karen's friends who try to help her get to the bottom of things. They both give enjoyable, likable performances. In many ways, they outshine the two leads.The Howling is one of the best werewolf movies of all time. It's a fresh, original film with magnificent effects, fun direction, great script, solid cast, and a nice score by Pino Donaggio.",The Howling
24,grantss,Okay,5,20 December 2019,"Reasonable werewolf movie, though the bar is set pretty low in that genre. Plot is better than most horror movies.

They packed everything into the last third to last half of the movie. It finished strong but considering the weak start, strong is relative. I had issues with the slow start and I had a real issue with one particular scene.
I know this can now be considered an early werewolf movie but there is something that I can't forgive or overlook. Why in the world would Karen (Dee Wallace) stand there to let Eddie (Robert Picardo) go through his entire metamorphosis before doing anything? Sure, as a viewer I want to see such a transformation, but as a viewer I would also like to see someone act appropriately. Was she so transfixed that she couldn't move until he was done? Was there an off-screen bargain between the two that she shouldn't move a muscle until he took his final form? Whatever the reason it was unacceptable. Seeing as how long it took for the werewolves to mutate it seemed like during that period would've been the prime time to escape. I'm just saying.",The Howling
27,evanston_dad,Will Do as the Werewolf Movie Against Which to Judge Other Werewolf Movies,7,31 March 2008,"Probably the definitive werewolf movie.When looked at as a whole, ""The Howling"" isn't one of the scariest films ever made, but there are individual moments in the film that certainly rank among some of the scariest from other films. Most notably is a scene in which a reporter is just on the verge of uncovering the mystery surrounding a werewolf colony and is attacked by one of the wolves in a deserted office. The creature design is spooky, even if many of the makeup effects owe their look to ""An American Werewolf in London,"" released the same year (big year for werewolves, apparently).Dee Wallace, who was the go-to actress for playing ordinary heroines in 1980s horror and fantasy films, makes an especially cute werewolf.

28,Uriah43,A Werewolf Film with a Certain 80's Quality to It,7,12 August 2019,"This film begins with a Los Angeles news reporter named ""Karen White"" (Dee Wallace) following certain leads into the identity of a serial killer known simply as ""the Mangler"". As it turns out, her main source is a suspect by the name of ""Eddie Quist"" (Robert Picardo) who entices her to meet him at a pornographic movie theater for more information. The meeting takes a horrific turn, however, as Eddie attacks Karen but is shot and killed by police officers near the scene. Severely traumatized by this event and suffering from amnesia Karen goes to a therapist named ""Dr. George Waggner"" (Patrick Macnee) who recommends some rest and recuperation for her at a scenic retreat known as ""the Colony"". Figuring that it would help both her and her husband, ""Bill Neill"" (Christopher Stone) they subsequently drive up the coast to spend some quality time there. Yet even though things seem fine at first, things take a bizarre course not long afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good werewolf film which took full advantage of the special effects available at this particular time. Also worth note is the manner in which some humor was mixed in here and there which added a certain 80's quality to the film as well.

31,kannibalcorpsegrinder,The better of '81s werewolf movies,10,6 April 2016,"Shaken up following a bizarre confrontation, a newswoman is taken to a colon of like-minded individuals out in the woods only to quickly get the feeling something strange is occurring in the area and tries to prevent herself from succumbing to the truth.This one is such a lot of fun that there's not a whole lot really wrong here. What really makes this one stand-out is the fact that there's a decided and enjoyable devotion to suspense along the way as it really settles into a pretty chilling tale along the way. The mis-direction at the beginning with the stalker angle and how it all confronts itself in the adult-theater gives this a great start, especially with the way it subtly hints at the change through the shrouded fog of the booth hiding it perfectly and requiring the need for the trip to the woods which is where the film really gets going here. From the constant otherworldly wolf-howls constantly echoing throughout the woods, the discovery of the slaughtered animals with inhuman wounds and the growing realization of the impending turn that it creates a rather frantic and chilling set-up here for the truth to come out really well. Even the other efforts here to bring the werewolf angle out, the investigation into the attacker and his connection with the colony out in the woods leads to some great fun here and leads into another really strong aspect here with that coming out in full-force on the great attack on the colleague out in the woods. With the pieces coming together nicely and the chasing throughout the area leading to a great scene that finally lets the truth be known, it sets up the film's utterly iconic and centerpiece sequence in the confrontation in the office here turns into the greatest transformation ever done. This shows the whole transformation in agonizing detail, starting with a close-up of the yellow eyes and the starting of the fangs to appear. From there, the face begins to get hairier and hairier, the eyes yellower, and the fangs more pronounced changing to get more dog-like and the snout begins to form, getting longer and longer with the face blackening. Finally, we get the body to change into a more wolf-ish form, and the best on-screen werewolf transformation is complete into a very fierce and evil-looking monster. This film's werewolf is the design that I hold closest to the official design of a werewolf ever. The design gives it a totally evil presence and it looks ready to rip the throat out of anyone who is unlucky enough to see it. That is a lot more threatening than a person who becomes a werewolf and is struggling with the curse of being one. With the action at the finale at the barn here they confront the creatures once and for all making this a wholly exciting old-school throwback finish where they're seemingly surrounded by creatures on all sides, it gives this a lot to really enjoy here over the lone flaw here. The only complaint here is that the werewolves are seen too close to the end to really make an impact. The threat is always there, but not once is a werewolf seen up until the end. They needed to appear more in the film. Beyond that, there's some debate to be had over the greatness of the effects, but no one will ever deny that this is one of the genre's landmark films.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, sex scenes included porno-movie footage, and scenes set in a porn shop.",The Howling

It is also one of the first (if not the first) to do an on screen transformation scene not using the old frame by frame technique. The story has a female reporter traumatized after she helps the police track down a serial killer. A friend psychiatrist sends her to a retreat known as ""the colony"" to help her unwind and get to the root of her problem. Well lets just say her first impulse was right as she really seems to think her and her husband are out of place in this retreat. I would agree, I do believe I would have left after seeing the first little beach party where the guy about to throw himself in the fire seemed the most sane. For the most part this movie has a bit of a slow setup, but once it gets going near the last 20 or thirty minutes it really gets going. The werewolves look rather good, there are a couple of scenes where they appear to be nothing more than cartoons or something, but for the most part they look like working models. There is a bit at the end which puzzles me as it seems to add humor into what was otherwise a movie that wasn't trying to garner laughs. However, for the most part you get a rather nice horror movie with lots of stars, something of a rarity this day and age.",The Howling
35,trashgang,a werewolf classic,8,29 November 2012,"The Howling has become the father of the new werewolf flicks in the heydays of the eighties. But there was another masterpiece that sadly came out just after The Howling was released, An American Werewolf In London (1982). Why I'm saying this, because Rick Baker, make-up and special effects was involved in both of them. American Werewolf started earlier then The Howling but had financial problems so Rick started with The Howling but when the director of American Werewolf(John Landis) heard that news money was raised and Barker left The Howling to give it towards Rick Bottin. Rick made it a movie with excellent effects and became notorious surely after The Thing (1982).The Howling wanted to do the werewolf transformation in one shot but money prevented it to become that way. American Werewolf did it. But The Howling was the best known werewolf flick.Although being a classic I prefer American because things starts of immediately. The Howling takes almost 50 minutes before a werewolf comes in and the effects become clear. But I must say that the last 40 minutes are worth watching. What a delight to see.The acting was rather good and the way it was filmed (advised by Bottin to use shadow and not that much of lighting) gave it a creepy feeling. A lot of memorable names are here to see but one that was becoming the next big thing was the werewolf Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks). She was noticed because she went full frontal here but her career was suddenly stopped by cancer, she died age 46.Mixed feelings because it isn't a good movie the first 50 minutes but it's a classic for so many reasons. Still, I gave it an 8 for the effects alone. Still, not that gory for a werewolf flick made in the heydays of slashers.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",The Howling

It veers from excellent to very average, from pure poetry to mundane TV quality but the fact that there is the TV backdrop lets this low budget movie off the hook in my opinion. I love the humour and whilst I wouldn't want to suggest the humour is overdone in American Werewolf in London, I certainly feel it is more focused in this film. The cinematic references are sweet and one thing I noticed this time was a copy of Ginsberg's Howl laying by a telephone - made me smile anyway. The transformations are excellent, for me they go on a little too long but then I guess they are the money shots. Talking of which the early porno shots are more extreme than I remember, maybe the UK release was once censored a little. Although the bleak horror of these early rapid shots of a girl tied to a bed are not quite matched by the later horrors the potent images remain throughout the film's duration ensuring a slight edginess even when the humour might be inclined to soften the terror effects. Super tight little horror with just enough humour and I must not forget just enough seriousness too, thanks to Patrick Macnee's occasional reminders of the 'beast of man'. Splendid.",The Howling
39,siderite,I do hope the book is better,6,2 August 2013,"I've begun watching The Howling with high expectations, as someone described it as ""one of the 2 best Werewolf movies ever made"". Unfortunately, he just might be right, but that is not saying much. Probably the spike in quality is caused by the movie being a book adaptation and I do hope the book was a lot better.Now, don't imagine the movie is very bad. For an 1981 movie with werewolves, indeed it is good, but it has that feel of a money grabbing movie studio doing an adaptation after a money grabbing publisher selling books of a certain type. You've all read those books: somewhere in a small American town, where everybody knows each other and there is dark secret, a city dweller comes to shake up the status quo. Probably Americans read a lot of these books, but I've had it up to my furry neck and my pointy teeth with this kind of bull. It is boring, pretentious and most of the time rehashing similar stories that were probably good when they were written but have now dissolved into lameness.Bottom line: I am sure I have seen this movie before, when I was young, but except the scene at the end, which had its share of drama and societal satire, I did not remember one thing while watching it again now. It is a mostly forgettable movie, with unsympathetic characters and a rushed story so that it can cover the entire book.

All those computer effects today got to you!"". Believe me, I've heard it. I don't even think that computer effects are that impressive. I'd rather watch this than the ""Hulk"".

41,blanbrn,"A horror classic. That's creative, spooky, and just a feel good howling of a time!",7,2 September 2008,"Finally after many years I decided to watch this early 80's horror film classic. I must say overall I was well pleased the film is spooky and the special effects with the werewolves is very creative as the makeup is certainly a thumbs up from Rick Baker. And director Joe Dante did fine as he kept this film on a good path with the story and setting both being interesting choices. Dee Wallace stars as Karen White a sexy Los Angeles TV station reporter who's assigned to follow the story of a local serial killer who's been terrorizing the streets especially the L.A. red light districts. So upon her investigating one night she goes out on the streets and she goes into a world of adult book stores, massage parlors, strip clubs, and novel shops. Only finally Karen goes into a booth of nude peep shows that also shows snuff and sex torture films. As tips she's received from a strange voice has lead her here. After this encounter in the booth she becomes traumatized as it was near fatal with the apparent serial killer being in the booth. It's then upon advice from Karen's doctor she takes time off to a northern California mountain retreat called ""The Colony"". Only the people here seem very strange and different as these woods and wilderness have howling cries this bloody nightmare turns into a howling gore feast! Overall great horror film of the early 80's the chills and wolf makeup was grade A it really looked scary and spooky and the story is well done for a horror film it all makes for a howling good time!",The Howling
42,MovieAddict2016,"Not scary, not fun and just very campy and dated",4,23 May 2005,"I'm a fan of Joe Dante's work. ""Gremlins"" is a brilliant film and one of my favorites; its campy humor worked to great effect, it was pretty scary in its own silly little way and all in all it just worked perfectly. ""The Second Civil War"" is a great underrated satire of politics and war and ""Toy Soldiers"" isn't given much credit, but I liked it for what it was.But sometimes Dante stumbles. ""The Howling,"" in 1981, was a cash-in on the success of John Landis' ""An American Werewolf in London"" -- and it's distinctly familiar in its camp humor, human transformations, and even directorial style. This was before Dante had carved a name for himself and it really does just seem like he's copying Landis.""... Werewolf in London"" isn't a great movie but compared to this it does look a great deal better. ""The Howling"" involves bestiality, incest, and other uncomfortable subjects and its special effects -- which, at the time, were considered impressive -- are really poor. About three minutes is spent on one transformation, and nowadays it's just really boring. (Although I must say I prefer this stuff to CGI, it's still used too prominently and just isn't as cool as it thinks it is.) The humor is nonexistent. It's just a really cheesy movie with bad acting and Joe Dante has made far better films since. ""The Howling"" is generally considered to be some kind of ""classic"" of the werewolf genre (there's a werewolf genre??) but I can't classify it as such -- I was hugely disappointed.",The Howling
43,Rainey-Dawn,Good 80s Werewolf Flick,9,10 April 2016,"This is one of the better horror films out the 1980s - it's a popular werewolf film for a reason - it's good. Basically a colony of werewolves, a man that knows how to handle them (for awhile) and investigative reporters - makes for a very interesting werewolf flick.The only thing I did not like about this film was Eddie Quist's transformation - that bubbling head effect. It kept bubbling instead for far to long instead of simply transforming. I didn't like that in the 80s and after watching it again I still don't like it. Otherwise the transformations were good - the other werewolves.Eddie Quist was a very scary character - really the very beginning of the film made him extremely scary. His obsession with Karen White is sickening. This guy is one disgusting psycho.I can easily recommend this one to werewolf fans and horror fans in general.

45,sddavis63,"One Of The Best ""Modern"" Werewolf Movies",8,1 July 2011,"I suppose that you could call ""The Howling"" campy fun, but it's really much too good to be called ""campy."" This is actually a really good werewolf movie, filled with a lot of chills that does make you jump on a regular basis and is full of for the most part very well done transformation scenes. It's marred just a little bit by a plot that struck me as strange (yeah, I know, it's a werewolf movie so what would I expect) but overall there isn't very much to complain about.Dee Wallace (who may not be a ""big name"" but has remained amazingly busy in Hollywood over the years) was pretty good as TV news anchor Karen White, who is sought out and attacked by a serial killer. Traumatized by the event, she and her husband Bill (Christopher Stone) head off to ""The Colony"" - apparently some sort of rehabilitative community hoping to help her recover from her experience. Unfortunately, her horror has only just begun, as she soon discovers that the whole place is populated by - wait for it - werewolves, who the doctor in charge (Patrick Macnee) has apparently been trying (and apparently without much luck!) to civilize so that they can ""fit in."" So not only do we have werewolves, they're werewolves who are sort of undergoing therapy for rejection issues! (You have to love a movie that kind be really, truly scary a lot of the time but can still give you a chuckle when you think about it!)Now, this is rather bizarre. Since ""Doc"" knows what's going on, why does he send Karen up there? And, if he had a reason for sending her up there, why not tell us what the reason was? It's a bit strange - but, again, it's a werewolf movie! One also has to mention the extremely beautiful Elisabeth Brooks as one of the most alluring - shall we say - werewolves that you're going to come across in any movie anywhere. Brooks doesn't seem to have done a whole lot else of note, and she died tragically young, but if you see her as Marsha in ""The Howling"" you'll definitely remember her!Fans of the werewolf genre will love this. Of that I have no doubt. (8/10)",The Howling
46,thesar-2,Howl Some More,8,11 February 2011,"I actually had two new surprises, from a 1981 film, as I revisited what I always labeled as my ""Favorite Werewolf Movie of All Time,"" The Howling: it's not, in fact, my favorite, and (ARE YOU KIDDING ME?) The Doctor (Robert ""The Doctor"" Picardo on Star Trek: Voyager) is the sex-crazed werewolf, Eddie, that sets the whole movie into motion?OK, that reveals that I am a die-hard Voyager fan, but it also states how this movie keeps impressing me after all these years.A lot of avid werewolf fans love An American Werewolf in London when I barely liked that feature. Picture it: I was a kid, I had little patience. Okay, I still have very little of that ""quality"" but I needed to see the werewolf and soon or I would be busting at the seams. And American simply takes too long – especially when the man becomes aDOG.So, I always loved and was always faithful to (the original and you better stay, STAY far away from the sequels) The Howling because it gets me what I wanted the most: the anti-dog (stand-up) werewolf and quicker.Unfortunately, I realized something with this viewing: This movie ALSO takes a bit to get to the goods. There's an enormous set up that I had (as an adult now) little patience for, as well. The problem is: the version I watched overand overas a kid, was the edited TV version.When I watched this now, it was the DVD, with nothing edited out and it took more than half the relatively short horror flick to produce the werewolf. Now, that said, when it did appear, it was Fantastic. So much for the CGI of today that literally mocks what a ""real"" (meaning, what I consider to be a MAN-WOLF, a standing man who turned into a wolf) werewolf looks like.What we have here is: News Anchor, Karen (Wallace – later known as Wallace-Stone) is investigating brutal attacks and agrees to meet Eddie who readily attacks her while changing into a werewolf. She doesn't fully realize this as a rookie cop shoots and supposedly kills him.Shaken and stirred Karen agrees to a mountainside retreat under the guidance of Dr. George Waggner (Macnee) with her husband. Unfortunately, she's unwilling to partake in sex, and Marsha (Brooks) is. And unfortunately for Karen, her husband is willing to partake in sexwith Marshaand a quick bite, transforming him into a werewolf.Scared, Karen calls her news station friend, Terry (Balaski) up who, along with her own husband, has been researching ""the beast within."" Once it's realized this group of spiritual healers at the retreat aren't up to actual healing, it's time for heroism, escape and the story of the century.The reason I realized this is not my favorite werewolf movie is because, frankly, Jack Nicholson's Wolf, is actually an overall better made film. While The Howling gave me everything I absolutely love about the myth of the ""wolf-man,"" i.e. a man that resembles a wolf, albeit a 6-foot-tall one, Wolf had better acting, story, dialogue, etc.That said, I will always cherish this film. It had comedy and a lot of tongue-in-cheek references (please tell me you noticed the dozens to other films.) And when the movie finally got going, half-way through, it was fierce. In fact, the mid-section of horror/attacks is some of my favorite werewolf attack-scenes in any movie to date, let alone any When Animal Attacks film.",The Howling
47,gridoon,Way overrated. Nothing special.,5,12 January 2000,"""The Howling"" is a highly overrated horror movie. Apart from its great special effects, it really has little to recommend it. It isn't particularly scary, or clever, or original, and it's totally forgettable. Even its spectacular effects are often awkwardly presented, in various set-pieces that run on too long, because they are clearly designed just to showcase those effects, not to further the story. The direction is often awkward, too; in the first 20 minutes, it's hard to know what's going on, and the fast cuts in the editing are TOO fast to have any impact. As for the cameos and the movie references, they can't save the film. Are we supposed to know what John Sayles looks like or which are the names of 1950's werewolf b-movies?",The Howling
48,lost-in-limbo,You can't contain that inner beast.,6,18 April 2006,"Karen White is an investigative TV reporter who suffers a nervous breakdown after a horrific encounter with Eddie Quist; a serial killer who gets gun down in front of Karen. To recover from this incident; she and her husband head to a remote psychiatric retreat run by Dr. George Waggner. But while there she becomes even more on edge, as Karen suspects that there are weird things going on at this camp with the woods coming to life with constant howling and one of the women there is getting real close to her husband. Meanwhile, back in LA her work buddies Chris and Terry continue their investigation into Eddie and come up with some unusual revelations. When they go to check out his corpses, the body is gone.I don't know, but never really got the hype that surrounded this flick. The first time I watched it was somewhat unsatisfied. The next time it was slightly better, but I just couldn't put my finger on why its held up so high, as again I was still left a little unimpressed. So, third time around my thoughts are still the same, but I probably got a bit more from it now than from my previous two viewings. That's not to say I think now it's a grand piece of entertainment, more so a mildly riveting exercise that has it's pluses and minuses.The film paired up director Joe Dante and screen writer John Sayles again, after their collaboration in the incredibly witty, 'Jaws' knock-off ""Piranha (1978)"". ""The Howling"" goes for a sinister outlook in its contemporary take on the werewolf genre and Sayles' thoughtful script steers mostly away from the clichés associated with Hollywood werewolf films. Here it sticks with the true mythology (being able to shape shift whenever) of the lycanthropy. The one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb is the overabundance of in-jokes, satirical humour and references to old flicks. The sharply, sardonic humour seemed to hold a great rapport with the seriously morbid approach Dante went for here. What did get on my nerves though, was the plodding mid-section, which just didn't draw me in like I hoped. Well, I actually found the sub-plot with Chris and Terry investigating Eddie to be far more interesting with some unexpected developments than the main focus on the leadenly, dramatised interactions between Karen and her husband Bill with the strange occurrences at the medical retreat.After the relentlessly, seedy atmospheric build up within the first ten minutes, the story slowly dragged for quite a bit. That's until it makes way for an anxiety packed final half hour with one or two memorably, jarring scenes. Although, I found the climax somewhat anti-climatic. When it wants to be suspenseful, it is. I just wish there was more of it. Since the undeniably grimy atmosphere is perfectly, high on mood and when it shifts to its forebodingly, foggy woodlands its hard to escape the nightmarish feel, especially at night with eerie howling. The scenery is simply top-notch. Now I just wish the characters followed the same suit. Honestly they were mostly a unlikable lot that I didn't I care for one bit. Actually, I enjoyed the support roles more than I did of the leads. Belinda Belaski and Dennis Dugan as Terry and Chris were sturdy in their performances and gave their characters a little bit of solidarity. Robert Picardo nails it down as the slithering, monstrous Eddie Quist. There's a neat cameo from Dick Millar too. But the rest just didn't do anything for me. Dee Wallace was rather unconvincing and predictably uneven in her performance I thought. The same for Christopher Stone as her husband Bill Neill. Patrick Macnee seems lost at sea as Dr. George Waggner.What made the film has got to be the cracking special effects by Rob Bottin! I really liked the towering werewolf designs. But it was the transformations that caught the eye with the repulsively, petrifying body morphing. The convincing detail that went into it is exceptional, but I thought at times it did take away from the overall effect by going on for just too long. The light in those scenes and sometimes other sequences was extremely poor I thought. Even the editing is kind of choppy and there's a odd inventive camera shot amongst the orthodox frame shots. Sometimes I thought the zooms got to close to the action, where we don't always get a good look of what's happening. But the score just felt out-of-place and basically corny. The film does have a sleazy tone and there's a grisly werewolf attack here and there.Even though I found ""The Howling"" to be rather unsavoury as a whole, but there's a definite backbone that holds the film together with its wry humour and gruesome make-up effects.",The Howling
49,bowmanblue,I should have watched this sooner,5,9 October 2014,"This may be an odd comparison, but I couldn't help think about The Godfather when I was watching The Howling. After over thirty years I have only just got round to watching this horror 'classic' - just like I only watched the Godfather the other year. I'm afraid I disliked them both.I didn't hate them, I just didn't view them as the 'classics' they were both hyped to be. I can see why they have that status though. They are both very good, however, after over thirty years, other films in both their respective genres have copied them to such an extent that I felt like I'd seen both films already (and done better/more modern).I'll bet if I watched the Howling (and the Godfather) twenty or thirty years ago, I would have been as awestruck as everyone else. However, I found The Howling a little boring. Not much happens in the first half an hour. Then, when the werewolves do come into it, you can already tell who's who and any 'plot twists' that are going to come. The effects are good - for their time. Granted you can see they're anamatronics when compared to today's slick computer-generated effects, but they're still good.The Howling was obviously a great horror of its day, but, after watching nearly thirty years of other werewolf movies, I'm afraid I'll stick with Dog Soldiers (although I'd probably take The Howling over a topless Taylor Lautner).",The Howling

54,tomgillespie2002,"A combination of great writing, incredible special effects, and a director with gleeful affection for the genre",6,14 October 2012,"The Howling was the first of a cycle of werewolf themed horror films in the early 1980's (The Beast Within (1982), The Company of Wolves (1984, and Silver Bullet (1985)). Two other specific sub-genre pieces were released in 1981 (An American Werewolf in London and Wolfen), and could be seen as simply a product of film economics and bankable trends. Whilst financial reasons are fundamental to film production, innovations in other fields also contribute to this sudden vogue for lycanthropic themes. Prosthetic special effects had been transformed, particularly in horror cinema, by such films as Jaws (1975) and Alien (1979) (or even the inventive puppetry work of Jim Henson's creature workshop), which opened the door for a new generation who would elevate the craft of monster effects, bringing a more realistic, and fantastical vision to the screen. Even into the 1970's, the werewolf transformation was still created in the same way than 1941's iconic The Wolf Man, with a series of dissolves, adding fur and fangs progressively through the shots. The modern werewolf movie was to begin that horror trend to show everything. Filmmakers now had the ability (with the incredible skills of the likes of Rick Baker, Rob Bottin and Stan Winston) to show the transformation from man to monster, in visceral detail.Rick Baker was originally drafted to provide the special effects for The Howling, (he had to leave due to a commitment he made with John Landis for An American Werewolf in London), and was replaced with Rob Bottin, who did an incredible job. Aside from the effective transformations in the film, director Joe Dante's and screenwriter John Sayles (who previously collaborated on Piranha (1978), infuse the story with their combined knowledge of horror cinema, along with some humour. Dante represents that first generation of film geeks. His knowledge of cinema is encyclopaedic and his knowledge through referencing is displayed explicitly on the screen. Many of the characters are named after directors who had historically filmed werewolf movies (Freddie Francis, George Wagner, Terrance Fisher). The characters are also aware - within the film - of the conventions of werewolf mythology, which has been learnt from being within an increasingly film literate culture, perhaps an early use of post-modernist pop-cultural reflexivity. Coming out of a trend for more gritty, realistic horror (a cycle begun with Hitchcock's Psycho (1960)), and during the horror saturation of the slasher sub-genre, The Howling begins in the underbelly of society, Dee Wallace plays a television news reporter (Karen White) who has been conversing with a serial killer. She meets with him in the seedy back room of a porn shop. The opening feels more like a ""dirty"" slasher like Maniac (1980), with it's pseudo-Scorsese mean streets, that a monster movie, an opening that was utilised when advertised - the posters and trailers rarely alluded to the ""beastly"" aspect of the story. After the trauma Wallace endures from her meeting with Eddie (Robert Picardo - the serial killer), she is advised by her doctor Wagner (Patrick Macnee), to spend some time at a rehabilitation resort that he runs. Writer Sayles re-wrote the original script that had been adapted from a novel by Gary Brandner, and change it significantly, and brought in the same satirical charm that was in the Piranha (1978) script. Sayles came up with the idea of the resort, the kind of self help group that was prevalent in the 1970's.After the failure of the hippie ""revolution"" at the end of the 1960's, and the people's disillusionment of our institutions and governments resulting from incidents such as the Kennedy assassinations and Watergate, many of the lost generation (generation x) were looking for something spiritual, something other than reality. Many groups of ""New Age"" spiritualist and pop-psychologists were formed, in sometimes sinister forms. This kind of congregation would quite often be corrupt, and fuelled with sexual oppression. And what the victimised Karen finds at the spiritually enhancing resort is an archaic hive for the neurotic species of wolf. In this coven, the wolves are outsiders, on the fringes of society, and is a diminishing group who's relevance in the modern world is narrowing - they are struggling to function in this age. No doubt a comment also on the relevance of this Universal Monsters icon, having lost its ability to scare some time in the 1940's.A combination for great writing, incredibly effective special effects, and a director with gleeful affection for the genre, The Howling is a very well constructed horror film. It moves from the grindhouse ""realism"" of it's opening to the revelations of the creatures with consideration, creating a natural narrative structure. It is the equivalent of Robert Rodriguez' From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), which suddenly changed the genre from crime to vampiric horror. Despite the incredibly low budget, produced and distributed by AIP (America International Pictures), the stylish cinematography and editing, the film still holds up today, and is far superior than many of the werewolf films being made today (The Wolfman (2010) or Red Riding Hood (2011) for example). It's just a shame about all the sequels - six in total, which inevitably lose much of the sharp, satirical script and a collection of great character actors (including Kevin McCarthy, Slim Pickens, John Carradine). And what the hell; it's a lot of fun to watch.",The Howling

Sure, some of the humor and in-jokes were a little off-putting, but the Drama more than made up for it. And that transformation... It actually looked- and FELT!- like bones and tendons were rearranging themselves, that skin was being stretched to its limit(s). Proof enough: Eddie Quist was screaming his a-- off...

The Vampirella bimbo has a really dark magnetism and the transformation was so realistic that as a child, I put my hands over my eyes and followed the scene with my ears! In other words, I think that no other horror movie has mixed so much this genre with erotica.But the movie isn't only that and it's evident that there is a book behind because there are a lot of innovative ideas (as werewolves trying to adapt to modern life, leaving hunting to turn into almost farmers). Another theme is the power of television as it's the feeling of all filmmakers of Spielberg generation.The cast made of familiar faces with unknown names is good and Dante is truly a great visual storyteller: he has a dynamic style while pacing slowly his story (as with his Gremlins).Finally, as the production finds great outdoors location as well, this cheap movie is truly a good one and gives a new vision to an old myth.",The Howling

The direction is great. It has a feeling of old monster movies mixed with 80's Slasher craziness, and even some comic book references.

This is a dark movie in all the sense of the word.Please, watch ""The Howling"" because it's probably the best Werewolf movie in twenty years and because it's an important Horror movie from the 80's. The movie starts directly to the point. A brave t.v. reporter (Dee Wallace Stone) meets with a serial killer known as ""Eddie"" in order to get important information that could lead to solve the mystery of a killing spree in the city. When she meets him in a XXX store, he tries to attack her but police quickly shot him before. This traumatic events lead our heroine to seek the help of a psychologist who recommends her some rest in a special place he owns. Along with her husband, Wallace's character go to that place just to find fatal fates. As time passes, and many strange things occur, she suspects that something is just not right. The ""community"" is very weird. This community is a Werewolf community which has members such as serial killers, sexy vamps, and even old men among it's members. What is the mystery about the community? Who can help our heroine? Could it be that human society has something to do with it?

Some really funny scenes, good gory effects, and a tone that is perfect for its mixed-up story.  One of the best of its breed.",The Howling

62,jzappa,The Pulp Fiction/Kill Bill of Horror Movies,7,29 May 2010,"The Howling demonstrates Joe Dante's penchant for exploitation aesthetics, ironic revision and the subversive critique of genre staples, the combination of the sensibility of a cartoonist and a social satirist. It escapes me why this film is seen as no more than a werewolf slasher pic even by respected critics, because in a sense, it did what Scream did fifteen years later: self-deconstructing. It is not about the plot. It is about itself. It comments on all the conventions it happily plays upon itself. The violence, gore and werewolf metamorphoses are disarmed by the ironic way Dante utilizes and annotates them. He inserts countless in-jokes and references, often veiled and subtle, not just to movies and TV like with The Big Bad Wolf in The Three Little Pigs but also concerning characters eating Wolf Brand Chili, the momentary glimpse of a copy of Howl by Ginsberg, mention of DJ Wolfman Jack, characters with names like Terri Fisher, which could be a reference to the British director Terence Fisher, who did direct a film called Curse of the Werewolf. The focus of this extremely hip post-modern wolf man movie is mostly on the humor, satirizing pop culture and the self-help craze, gaining comic effect even from some of the special effects.But it goes much much deeper than merely being reference-happy. What is really clever about The Howling is its pervasive visual references to a variety of media forms and aspects of popular culture themselves. We see cameramen, bystander-like TV sets and movie posters galore, we go behind the scenes of a network TV station. There is stop-motion animation and puppetry as well as special effects by Rick Baker and Rob Bottin that were state-of-the-art at the time. A silhouette of one of the monsters is obviously a cartoon animation (not unlike in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein). John Sayles (who co-wrote the blatantly metatextual script) and Roger Corman have cameos. Dee Wallace-Stone plays a Hollywood TV news anchor who is being stalked by a serial killer. In cooperation with the police, she takes part in a sting to capture the killer by meeting him in a scuzzy porn theater, where he forces her to watch a film of a young woman being raped, before she sees him emerging from the shadows. The final scene is a brilliant diametric reversal of this scenario in terms of the role of what's really happening, what's happening on the screen, and in what way horrific reality is stopped by bullets.The brave anchor nonetheless submerges the memory of the tremendous sight which she cannot accept, so her therapist, Dr. George Waggner, named after the director of The Wolf Man with Lon Chaney and Claude Rains, sends her and her husband, Bill Neill, a thinly disguised reference to the director of Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, to a secluded countryside resort for treatment. As expected, the colony is chock full of oddball characters, and eventually werewolf sex, frightening shapeshifting and silver bullets abound. But all this elemental and earthy stuff takes place outside of the reach of mass media, at least to some extent, so a TV news anchor returning from this experience is going to want the world to know! But how can she? In a society surrounded and inundated by all kinds of bright, flashing mass broadcasting all the time, how can she make them truly connect and believe her claims no matter what she shows them?As befits a real B-grade horror flick, the leads are all basically interchangeable. Most of the more solid moments are left to the character actors, played by B-movie vets like Slim Pickens, John Carradine, and Dick Miller, as well as Patrick Macnee, who plays Wallace-Stone's shrink. I tend to nix comparisons to Tarantino because his fans tend to write off a lot of interesting filmmakers as QT wannabes, but this movie was made long before Tarantino burst onto the scene: The Howling is like the Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill of horror movies. It's a post-modern pastiche that arrives insisting it is the real thing to some degree, casting all the right people, playing its own creative variations on a classic old-hat plot device, engulfing us with reminiscences of other movies and media like it and at the same time giving it a real-world edge. The Howling so consciously plays upon fantasy and allusions to midnight movies of yesteryear and werewolf lore, and reintroduces common, prototypical features of style. And there is always something about that self-aware quality that frees us from taking it seriously and we have so much more fun with it.",The Howling
63,videorama-759-859391,A bit of howling anger.,7,7 March 2021,"On some levels, this cultish film (I'll use cultish as a lower word for cult) sort of disappoints, especially for those gore hounds, craving blood, a bit in limited supply here. The Howling, and there's been a few terribly spawned sequels, goes more for suspense and thrills, and sometimes this effectively works. The story has you reeled in from the start as a talk show host (horror icon Wallace, in that score of horror icons, we know) is the obsession of a serial killer, whose claimed a few women victims. Wallace, being the cheese, in an attempt, to trap him, well, it goes awry, where Wallace is attacked by a, you know who.... she passes out, awakens with no memory of the prior incident. At the suggestion of her collegue (Macnee) she and her husband, de-stress out on the farm, of shady middle aged folk, where everything of course is not what it seems. There are a few dead patches, where the interesting, thick premise of story, is kind of muddled in it's handling, and the result, is sort of incoherent, uneven flow. The cover of the film as you can see, is an eye grabber, and sadly The Howling, doesn't live up to the same excitement and color, for reasons, most mentioned earlier. Some moments fall flat, with dead patches like I said. It's biggest flaw to me, is it's lacks that excitement and punch. we see in other werewolf movies. Not to say this is bad. The film is very well made and Wallace's strong acting presence, makes the film more engaging. With tighter plotting, an even, and clearer flow of story, these are the things that greatly fault it too. Cute frying, credits ending, not for vegetarians, either.",The Howling

Now here comes ""The Howling"". I was too young to see this film at the time. But I heard on how good it was. A great cast was put into the film, and it did just fine. Dee Wallace plays a reporter who uncovered a story which seems to have a sinister secret. After the attack at the adult store, she gets severely traumatized. When her boss takes her and her husband(Christopher Stone,1942-95) to a private resort so she can recover from the incident she was in. Unbeknownst to her, the resort has a secret, and so does her husband. One of the members of The Colony, Marsha Quist (Elisabeth Brooks,1951-97) the nymphomaniac seduces the husband with beastly results. Then there's a attack by a animal. When Karen(Wallace) calls her friend to come by, she calls her boyfriend to warn him about The Colony. Not only the man who was shot in the adult place a member, he was also, a werewolf. Everybody in the resort are werewolves. After they were wiped out by the boyfriend and Karen, she would go back to work and warn the media about werewolves and their existence. She would become one of them, after her own husband attacked her. Questions asked,""Is it real? Or special effects?"" I'm not telling... This movie was great. I think it topped, the other werewolf film. It can bring out the wolf in you! HAHAHAHA!!! But seriously, I enjoyed it! 5 stars",The Howling
66,FiendishDramaturgy,A deserving cult classic.,8,7 January 2004,"There are few fence-riders where this movie is concerned. Most fans of the genre of Horror and of the sub-genre of WereWolf movies either love this movie...or hate it.Let me begin by saying that I admire this movie very much. I enjoy watching it, and the two subsequent sequels. In my opinion, after the third Howling, they got stupid, hokey, campy, and just plain bad. Also, let me warn you that this movie is dated, slow, and has large blocks of uneventful moments where even the most base character development is not being utilized.But, with that having been said, the story is a good story. It is poorly executed due to the large slow spots I mentioned before, but the story was a sound and well-written one. Everything does not just magically come together. The reporting team there as moral and emotional support for ace reporter, Karen White (Dee Wallace), is working very hard to put it together. Their discoveries do not come easy, but rather as a result of hard work, open-mindedness, and diligence. Not luck.The cinematography is mostly unremarkable, except for the scene in which Bill is attacked. The filmography is beautiful there, with the moonlight streaming out from behind two great trees, and the scene between is clear and lit by a beautifully brilliant silvery moonlight. Very good stuff.I also loved the use of The Wolf Man, 1941 with Lon Chaney, Jr. as a source for information in their research. This is an instance in which a movie used a real movie to quote, rather than some made-up movie. Wes Craven's use of this element was highly praised in the Scream Trilogy, and yet, here it is, twenty years earlier.This production also features a cameo by Forrest J. Ackerman, movie actor with credits in over 20 B-grade horror flicks, and a very good (if somewhat over the top) supporting performance by John Carradine.Naturally, most fans of the horror genre want to compare this movie to An American Werewolf in London. That is, of course, like comparing apples to submarines in that the former is a B production, with a small budget and the latter is a much larger funded project at exactly TEN times the budget. The Howling had a 17M return from a 1M investment, while AWiL had a 30.5M return from a 10M budget. Let's see...17X the investment/3.5X the investment. I'd have to say ""The Howling"" is the big winner, here, as far as profit goes. I use profit as a measuring stick, because it seems that profit is all Hollywood cares about anymore. Art and artistic expression no longer seems to be the point of film making these days. But for the sake of art, I loved both movies, this one and its competitor. The make up artistry used here was excellent, and actually worthy of the story. That, along with truly professional performances by Dee Wallace and Christopher Stone, make this an enjoyable and memorable film, which I have recently added to my DVD collection.All in all, I consider ""The Howling"" to be a benchmark film in the sub-genre of werewolf movies.It rates a hard-won 7.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Howling
67,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: The franchise film.,7,26 September 2004,"The Howling (1981) is the overrated horror ""classic"" that is responsible for burying the werewolf genre. Oh yes, during the early 80's the werewolf was nearing the end of being a staple in horror films. The films of Jacinto Molina (Paul Naschy) marked a long run and a renaissance of werewolf films from the late 60's until it's demise during the early 80's. When Senor Molina had a hard time getting a werewolf film off the ground, the writing was on the wall. But in Hollywood, the love fest with werewolf movies hadn't run it's course. Films like this one and American Werewolf in London redefined this dying genre incorporating state of the art f/x's (courtesy of Rob Bottin and Rick Baker). Instead of a rebirth, the genre died a slow death thanks to the many cheaply made and badly executed films that came out after this one (dare not speak of the horrible films that followed this one bearing the name Howling).The Howling tried something different but the results are a mixed bag. I would rate this movie highly except it's responsible for making a half dozen sequels which range from mediocre to down right unwatchable. The effects are remarkable and the film is full of familiar faces and cameos from people in the biz. It's perfect as a stand alone film. If you love this movie please stay away from the sequels. You'll never forgive yourself if you watched them. Trust me, I wished I never did. I fell on the sword so none of you have to witness the horror. I have seen them all and I wouldn't wish that upon my biggest and nastiest foe.Recommended for horror fans.I repeat, stay away from the sequels!!",The Howling

69,dee.reid,"""The ""Howling"" - A ""Howling"" good time at the movies!",8,21 October 2016,"The 1981 Joe Dante-directed horror-thriller ""The Howling"" is a much, much better film than I remember it.Maybe I should try to explain that statement.You see, when I was in high school about this time 14 years ago, I went through a phase of consuming every piece of horror movie heaven I could get my hands on. One of the titles that made it into my circulation was ""The Howling.""I had first heard about ""The Howling"" through John Landis's landmark horror-comedy ""An American Werewolf in London,"" which was released later on the same year as ""The Howling""; ""An American Werewolf in London"" was the other in a trio of high-profile werewolf movies released in 1981 - that film, ""The Howling,"" and ""Wolfen."" And when all is said & done, ""An American Werewolf in London"" won the first competitive Oscar for Best Makeup in 1982, and that film remains my favorite werewolf movie ever and nothing I've seen has topped it.But what about ""The Howling""? Yes, ""The Howling."" ""The Howling,"" when I first watched it, I honestly was not that impressed. Perhaps the reason was because I expected it to be a horror-comedy like ""An American Werewolf in London."" And why shouldn't you expect ""The Howling"" to be a horror-comedy - it WAS directed by Joe Dante (the 1978 ""Jaws"" clone ""Piranha,"" 1984's ""Gremlins,"" and the 1989 Tom Hanks comedy ""The 'Burbs""), after all. So while ""The Howling"" does have some small comedic bits here & there and does, in fact, actually end on a punchline (in addition to containing a lot of in-jokey references to the werewolf movies of the past), it is, by & large, a straight-forward horror film, and a rather thrilling one, at that.Based on Gary Brandner's 1977 novel of the same name, Karen White (Dee Wallace) is a well-respected, well-known Los Angeles TV news anchor who is attacked by serial killer Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo) one night. Quist is killed by the police when he tries to attack Karen in a seedy downtown adult video store. Instantly traumatized by the event, Karen and her husband Bill Neill (Christopher Stone) go off to the ""Colony"" - sent there by pop psychiatrist George Waggner (Patrick Macnee) - a quiet seaside resort located somewhere up the California coast, for some much needed rest & relaxation.But something is not quite right about the Colony. Aside from some of the slightly bizarre characters she meets there, including a seductive black-leather-clad nymphomaniac named Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks), Karen is troubled by some strange ""howling"" noises she hears at night, to which Bill is highly skeptical of. Meanwhile, Karen's colleagues Chris (Dennis Dugan, who would later become a director of several blockbuster Adam Sandler comedies in the '90s) and Terri (Belinda Balaski) uncover a shocking connection between the deceased serial murderer Eddie Quist and the Colony...""The Howling"" is a thrilling film. Of course, the reason you go to this picture in the first place are those special effects. Yes, the special effects that were created here by Rob Bottin, who was a protégé of Rick Baker; Baker was originally given the job of doing the special effects here, but left the project to work on John Landis's ""An American Werewolf in London,"" and entrusted everything to Bottin. (Rick Baker won the first Oscar for Best Makeup for his work on ""An American Werewolf in London."") But just because Rob Bottin had been entrusted with ""The Howling's"" special effects, that does not automatically mean that he was inferior in any way to his mentor and close friend. In fact, Bottin's effects here are on par with Baker's Oscar-Winning work on ""An American Werewolf in London""; it's disappointing to know that Rob Bottin's special effects weren't even nominated alongside Baker's because the werewolf transformation sequences here - utilizing air-bladder make-up effects and latex applications - like Baker's work in ""An American Werewolf in London,"" are eye-popping and still hold up 35 years later (and still blow away many of the CGI-laden horror vehicles of today).""The Howling"" is an excellent horror-thriller to see again after all these years, and I'm thankful to have been given a chance to re-evaluate my overall opinion of it. Yes, I do enjoy its companion piece ""An American Werewolf in London"" much more, but I'm glad that I can watch the two movies and still see them as two completely different works of werewolf-horror, from two incredibly talented directors who know how to make us scared one minute, and have us laughing the next.8/10",The Howling

However, I found it rather disappointing. Not a poor film - no, not at all - but certainly not a fabulous one as so many viewers seem to suggest. Perhaps you have to be hooked on the whole werewolf sub-genre in order to get a blast out of a film like this? There are certainly some compensations to be found, including enjoyable performances, clever in-jokes and spectacular werewolf transformation sequences, but The Howling just doesn't deliver the requisite scares and is too cliché-ridden for my liking.TV newscaster Karen White (Dee Wallace) helps the police to lure in a serial killer, Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo). However, the scheme goes awry and Karen escapes a nasty demise by the skin of her teeth. Plagued by nightmares of her recent ordeal, she is advised by her psychiatrist Dr Waggner (Patrick Macnee) to go with her husband to a quiet retreat called ""The Colony"" for recuperation. The retreat seems quiet and relaxing enough, and is certainly a long way from the hustle and bustle of regular day-to-day life, but Karen still feels uneasy. Karen's husband tries to convince her that it's just a result of her fragile mental state, but gradually she begins to fit together the truth behind the retreat. It seems that all the residents are werewolves - among them the terrifying Eddie Quist himself - and Karen's only choice is to join them or be devoured!Director Joe Dante had already earned a small cult following after his comedy-horror ""Piranha"" a couple of years before, and with The Howling he gained more fans for his semi-camp take on the werewolf genre. However, for me it simply isn't in the same league as some of the other legendary horror films (The Exorcist, Don't Look Now and The Omen, for instance, are all a huge deal better) - heck, The Howling isn't EVEN among the best werewolf films ever made (The Wolf Man and An American Werewolf In London are two for starters that are far superior). In The Howling, the plot seems too predictable and Dee Wallace, in the key role, is inadequate. Real scares are missing - replaced by an unhealthy reliance on special effects. Admittedly I thought the special effects were good, especially for the era, but they alone can't make up for the telegraphed plot developments and the lack of a genuinely tense and unsettling atmosphere. The humorous use of character names that sound like old horror actors and directors (e.g Fred Francis, Jack Molina, Terry Fisher, etc.) is a nice touch, and Pino Donaggio provides an effective score, but on the whole The Howling only rates as an average entry. It has its army of fans but for the life of me I can't figure out why.",The Howling

75,ferbs54,A Howling Success,7,15 November 2008,"So it would seem that ""Wolfen"" wasn't the only quality film dealing with werewolves that came out in 1981. That same year, Joe Dante, with ""The Howling,"" delivered what is in essence a gift to all horror fans. His werewolf picture features some truly frightening monsters, several of the most impressive transformation sequences anyone could desire, and a cast that is itself a tribute to the classic horror pictures of the past. In the film, we meet TV news anchor Karen White, appealingly played by Dee Wallace a year before ""E.T."" would make her a household name. After a traumatizing run-in with a serial killer, Karen and her husband (played by Dee's then real-life husband Christopher Stone) go up the California coast to rest and recuperate at The Colony, an alternative-lifestyle, group-therapy retreat of sorts run by a pop psychiatrist (the ever suave Patrick Macnee). At this late date, I don't think I'm spoiling the party too much by stating that The Colony's residents are a pretty, uh, hairy bunch of folk! Dante directs his film skillfully, and although he reserves most of Rob Bottin and Rick Baker's remarkable FX for the final third, the viewer is constantly afflicted with a feeling of unease, leavened by much insider humor. That great cast of horror vets--including John Carradine, Kevin McCarthy, Kenneth Tobey and Dick Miller (hilarious as antique bookseller Walter Paisley...the same name he sported in Roger Corman's 1959 quickie ""A Bucket of Blood""!), plus cult fave Slim Pickens and appearances by Corman himself and horror editor Forrest J. Ackerman--is truly a godsend, and some likable newcomers, such as the late Elisabeth Brooks, with her Angelina Jolie-like good looks, and Robert Picardo, who few will recognize as the holographic Doctor from ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" make significant contributions. When I saw this film in the mid-'80s, I remember thinking how strange it was that Dennis Dugan, who I knew only as a weasly putz from an old ""M*A*S*H"" episode, should wind up being the hero here, but such indeed is the case. Watching the film recently, for the first time in well over 20 years, I was struck by how much I remembered of it, and indeed, some of the picture's set pieces are truly made to stick in the memory. Though followed by five in-name-only sequels at this point, all of which are supposedly pretty lame, the original ""Howling"" is surely the one to go for.

76,Jonny_Numb,unbelievably overrated,3,12 November 2005,"To avoid being pelted with a bushel of tomatoes, perhaps I should say right off the bat that I have never been a fan of werewolf movies, and therefore have always had a reflexive passivity towards them. ""The Howling"" piqued my interest mainly because of a glut of laudatory reviews from horror fans (and while I certainly fancy myself one, I will also say that the opinions of the masses often contradict my own), the direction of Joe Dante (who would fare much better with the ""Gremlins"" films, plus a segment of ""The Twilight Zone Movie""), and its position on Bravo's ""100 Scariest Movie Moments."" And while I tried not to let these factors build up my hope beforehand, I couldn't help but be let down by ""The Howling""--here's a movie without a single memorable character, a plodding storyline whose twists can be seen a mile away, and a tongue-in-cheek attitude that seldom yields laughs. Bland blonde Dee Wallace (""Cujo""; ""The Frighteners"") plays a reporter menaced by a stalker; after two cops shoot the stalker down in a porno booth, Wallace is menaced by memories of the incident and sent to an isolated seaside rehab clinic where--you guessed it--the stalker is the head of a colony of lycanthropes. While the concept bubbles over with possibilities, ""The Howling"" feels lazy and indifferent, only coming to life during the drawn-out transformation scenes (excellent FX work by Rob Bottin). Veteran B-listers Dick Miller, John Carradine, and Slim Pickens fare well in small roles, and careful viewers will catch cameos by director Roger Corman and Mick Garris. Unfortunately, these tiny details are just that--tiny details. And they certainly don't obscure the fact that ""The Howling"" is one of the most overrated films in the annals of horror.",The Howling

For me, the acid test of this kind of movie is the monster, and make-up effects genius Rob Bottin creates fabulous, cartoon-inspired, hairy, snarling, bipedal, fanged horrors straight out of Little Red Riding Hood. They are terrifying, absurd and visually stunning; there is a moment where Balaski pulls a paper file from a drawer and a werewolf hand enters screen right and delicately plucks it from her which is one the most deliciously scary horror movie moments ever done. I also love the way this film is all over the place thematically; the first fifteen minutes come on like a sleazy urban nightmare, then it turns into an adult fairy-tale. It plays as a straight horror flick but it's also an absurd satire of TV news, self-help therapy and communal living. Wallace's intense, straight-as-an-arrow performance should be at odds with the sly jokes and outrageous situations, but it's not - it just all gels seamlessly. She's backed up by an amazing support cast - Balaski is just sensational as the intrepid Terry, Brooks is every teenage boy's fantasy come true and her last line is a corker. Macnee, McCarthy, Miller and Pickens are lovable old pros, Picardo is unforgettable as the depraved killer and the iconic Carradine is terrific in one of his last great roles (the first shot of him is fabulous). And don't miss Sayles' cameo as a dogmatic morgue attendant. Dante directs with an assured combination of technical prowess, classic horror suspense and shocking imagery, pulling the very best movie possible from all the tools at his disposal. The showpiece werewolf transformation scene is truly stunning, but the movie is full of action, suspense, evocative shots, amusing observations and hair-raising moments. John Hora's camera-work is dynamic and dreamlike, exactly the right mix of light and shade to squeeze the emotion out of each scene. I adore monster movies, and this is one of the best; though some have come close (David Thewlis in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban), nobody for me has yet bettered the lovely lycanthropes in this picture. See it with the lights out.",The Howling
78,vertigo_14,Silver Bullets My Ass! (spoilers),7,13 August 2004,"'The Howling' is one of my favorite werewolf movies (ranking somewhere just under 'Brotherhood of the Wolf' which lends to both a great story more than special effects--most were painfully noticeable CGI). Travel back to the days of scream queens and animatronics and you have what I believe to be one of the best werewolf movies ever (or at least of the 1980s titles).Dee Wallace plays Karen Stone, a TV news anchor who was reporting on a mysterious serial killer named Eddie Quist (played by Dante film regular, Robert Picardo). She becomes traumatized by something she witnesses during a freaky visit with the elusive Quist. Unable to shake the nightmares, she takes a break from work and heads upstate to a retreat in the mountains with her husband Bill (played by Dee Wallace's then husband, the late Christopher Stone). But, the retreat is no peaceful setting and most of the residents are quite eerie. Especially cabin neighbor Marsha (Elizabeth Brooks) and her creepy cannibal brother, T.C. (Don McLeod). Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Karen's coworkers, Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terry (Belinda Balaski) are on their own scavenger hunt, investigating deeper into the bizarre and creepy persona of Eddie Quist, leading to a discovery of why The Colony residents are so suspicious. In the age of animatronics and latex handywork, Rick Baker and his special effects team (yes, other people can do movie magic besides the famous Stan Winston studio) provide the awesome visual wizardry that make this (and many horror movies of the 1980s) so fantastic. We see a lot of human-to-werewolf transformations (and some obviously animated human-to-werewolf transformation sequences), which is always a good quality for modern horror movies. With Joe Dante directing, expect to see a lot of Dante cast regulars, including Robert Picardo as Eddie Quist and big screen horror favorite, Dick Miller (who is nearly always cast by Dante and is paired up with Picardo again in the Dante horror comedy, The 'burbs, as the garbagemen). The cast has some pretty notable people for it's day (besides Dee Wallace who is well known in the genre). While American Werewolf in London, released the same year, is most known for it's terrific special effects sequences, it is not the best werewolf movie of the 80s simply because the story isn't all that entertaining (and often becomes too long) because it's too simple (two hikers get lost in England, one killed by a werewolf, and the dead friend floats around in purgatory trying to warn his friend that he, too, is now a werewolf since he was bitten by the same creature). That's what distinguishes the Howling, one of the major werewolf productions of the 80s, from American Werewolf in London. The fact that The Howling offers a more entertaining story and characters (and the wacky soundtrack) that will really leave you with a disturbing feeling (what is it about these weirdos at The Colony and what does it all have to do with Eddie Quist). This is quite a different werewolf tale as well, though it has elements of the old 50s horror movies (like old, wise locals warning people newcomers to beware of something evil about the town). But, for the most part, it is an original, entertaining story, with super special effects.",The Howling
79,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Classic Werewolf with an Interesting Premise,9,2 October 2019,"This was a film that I actually had not seen until I was already out of college from my recollection. I know I watched the sequel when I was with my cousin and that film had me thinking this was going to be wilder than what it was. Oddly enough though, I think I saw another of the sequels too when I rented it from the video store after seeing part two. I will also be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan of this one the first time I saw it. I gave it a rewatch for a horror movie challenge I'm doing as it filled a couple categories for me. The synopsis is after a bizarre and near deadly encounter with a serial killer, a television newswoman is sent to a remote mountain resort whose residents may not be what they seem.We start this off with seeing a screen and hearing different conversations in the background. One of the reporters is Karen White (Dee Wallace). She has been receiving calls from Eddie (Robert Picardo). We see his apartment and learn he's a serial killer. He is intrigued by Karen and she agrees to meet him. Back at the studio, they are running a sting operation with the police. Her husband is R. William Neill (Christopher Stone). He is upset with how they're running it as he doesn't feel she is safe. The news station is run by Kevin McCarthy (Fred Francis). Currently on the air is an interview of Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee), who is kind of a new age guru that has just released a book.The operation runs into some problems and they cannot hear Karen's conversation with Eddie. She is told to go to a local porn shop and to meet him in one of the booths. She does and he comes in behind her. He starts to change, but it is dark and she can't really see what is happening. Two cops come in and save her by shooting him through the door.Karen attempts to get back on the air a couple days later, but she freezes up. At home Bill tries to make love to her and she can't. She is having nightmares and having PTSD to what happened. That is when Dr. Waggner recommends she go to his retreat to rest up. Bill is also invited to come with her.While this is going on, Chris Halloran (Dennis Dugan) and his girlfriend Terry Fisher (Belinda Balaski) are looking into Eddie. They find his apartment and see some weird drawings of him where he looks like a wolf as well as one of Karen. They also see a drawing of a bay and all of these are quite good. They're led to a bookstore and to books on the occult.Karen is leery when they get to the retreat. Some of the other residents there are quite odd. Erle Kenton (John Carradine) is an elderly man who tries to kill himself that first night. Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks) takes a liking to Bill. There are also Donna (Margie Impert) and her husband Jerry Warren (James Murtaugh). It should be pointed out that Bill also doesn't eat meat and this retreat seems to have a wolf problem.Now there is actually more to this story that I decided to hold back, because I do think this should be experienced. I will admit, after this second viewing my thoughts have come up on this one, for the reason of what they're trying to get across.The first thing that intrigued me is Dr. Waggner. This film is really playing on the new age healing that was popular in the late 70's. There is this commune like retreat that these people are going to and there's just something not right about them. It is kind of hippy-ish. Marsha lives there and she really isn't on boar either. She is an in tune with nature person and also a nymphomaniac. There's an interesting angle with her and Bill, but it goes even deeper than that.I also found it intriguing that Karen wasn't raped, but she is having similar reactions like she was. I wouldn't be surprised to learn in the novel that she actually was and the movie didn't want to go that far. Regardless, I don't want to diminish what happened to her, because it is traumatic. Her PTSD is straining her relationship with her husband and they are really out of sync. It makes a lot of sense why he becomes interested in Marsha as well. I definitely felt bad for her so it adds another level.Now I never really stated what this about, but if didn't know, it is about werewolves. I've really wanted to read the novel to see how close they are, because I love the idea here. Having this retreat where they are living away from people is great and they're trying to find a way to adapt to a modern society. Those that are this creature though really believe they are superior and shouldn't adapt, but make humans be their prey. They're also bipedal and can change whenever they want to. I like that they are even showing the Universal classic The Wolf Man as kind of a meta way of filling in the back-story.I will admit that the first time I saw this, I found it to be boring. I had it in my head that it was longer than what it was and was shocked to see that it is just over an hour and half. I think now that I analyze films more, that really helped me here. We don't get a lot of werewolf action, but that is not to say that there aren't things going on behind the scenes. This is really kind of slow burn into a solid climax for sure. It still builds tension as the mystery is built and then solved. I really like the ending and the implications of it, especially since people don't believe what they're seeing. This is fitting for today and the politic climate we are living in.I'll shift this to the acting, which I thought was pretty solid. Wallace I think is great here. When I think of her, this is one of the films that pop into my head and I really like how she plays the role. She is broken by what happens to her and it affects everything around her. I like what she decides to do in the end as well. Macnee is also solid as this doctor who has an alternative way of handling things. Dugan and Balaski are both solid. I found the latter to be very attractive as well. Stone is fine and I thought McCarthy was funny. I liked the cameos by Carradine, Slim Pickens, Noble Willingham. I also thought that Brooks and Picardo round out the film for what is needed.Something I've been waiting to talk about is the effects, which are really good. It is interesting this came out the same year as An American Werewolf in London as two of the best in this subgenre came out so close to each other. I like that the werewolves are different here. We get a pretty solid transformation later in the film. I don't think it's as good, but I definitely think it worked. The blood and gore we do get works as well. I should give a shout out to Rick Baker who worked on this one. It is also shot very well also.Now with that said, this film I'm definitely glad that I finally gave it a rewatch with a critical eye, because it is much better than I remembered. I think it has some interesting concepts going on and some underlying issues it is exploring. The acting really help to bring this to life and the creature effects really make them seem real. The rest of the effects were solid. I don't know why I thought it was boring, because it was definitely paced in a way where the mystery builds and the climax gives us the creatures we want. The soundtrack really didn't stand out to me, but is also doesn't hurt the film. I think this is really good and one of the better werewolf films out there.",The Howling
80,Samiam3,All the better to eat you with,7,28 June 2009,"I'm running out of things to say about movies like The Howling. Once again, I am relatively impressed with filmmakers like Joe Dante who can make do with very little money, yet The Howling shares the same weakness as many of its predecessors and followers, lack of story, acting and characterization. Maybe I'm being a bit too demanding, I am indeed aware that The Howling is meant simply to entertain in a creepy horror tradition, and at this it does a fairly good job.After a traumatizing encounter with a serial killer, a young newswoman and her husband take a road trip to a rehabilitation center in the coastal wilderness run by the famed Dr. Wagger. It soon becomes apparent that something creepy is lurks within the area, something that howls and eats human flesh, is it human or animal, or both?There are two problems I have with The Howling. Firstly, there are more supporting characters than the story can deal with. Much of the cast does virtually nothing until the last twenty minutes. Secondly, the story runs by a little too quickly. The film needs a couple more scenes in which to flesh out the characters or build up conflict. Overall the movie is relatively suspenseful, though not as much as I think it could have been, and the creature effects are competent for a low budget. Therefore, The Howling is an acceptable little horror flick, offering decent b-movie monster fun, no more no less.",The Howling
81,Sherazade,Undoubtedly the inspiration for Michael Jackson's 'Thriller',4,12 January 2013,"The special effects were as good as can be expected of a movie made in 1980/81 but other than that is was poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted (especially by the female actors/characters), poorly edited and there were way too many inconsistencies and plot holes. Werewolves movies were to the 80s what Vampire movies are to us now, some were good and most were bad. I would recommend this movie only to people who are fans of some actor in the film and want to see every film they've ever acted in or for those who want to view it for nostalgic reasons or if you're like me and the movie was before your time and you just want to see what films of this genre looked like that back then.",The Howling
82,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Classic werewolf movie,8,15 March 2014,"Intentionally over-the-top werewolf horror/ satire, about a TV news reporter in LA, who is sent to a wilderness retreat to recover from a traumatic event. Once she and boyfriend get settled in, she slowly realises that nearly everyone is a former werewolf movie director, who turns into a werewolf when the become, shall we say, ""excited,"" and they want her man to join them.The makeup effects during said transformations still look good after all these years, and the film has a lot of intentional humour, as well as transitioning well from the sleazier side of LA, in its opening stages, to the peaceful(?) and quite, foggy woods where the remainder of the action is set.The worst part about this film is that it was followed by some of the worst sequels ever produced: part 2 (in then Czechoslovakia) might be good for a few unintentional laughs, but otherwise is terrible; part 3 (in Sydney) begins well, but quickly goes down the toilet after the first 20 minutes or so; part 4 (in South Africa) is coma inducing; part 5 (in Hungary) is the least awful of the lot; part 6 is heavy handed and depressing; part 7 is an unwatchable anti-movie.",The Howling
83,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Howling""- A shaky but competent werewolf-thriller. Enthralling despite its faults.",8,23 January 2017,"The odd thing about Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf-thriller ""The Howling"" is just how far removed at large from the franchise it spawned the film is. With eight sequels of a decidedly sub-par quality to its name, it'd be easy enough to condemn and dismiss Dante's movie as ""just another piece of schlocky 80's horror."" But that would be doing it a great disservice. Truth be told, while it's not quite the classic its cult audience may build it up to be, ""The Howling"" is a consistently competent and entertaining affair. A good horror film despite some admittedly large faults in the production and a few moments of shaky storytelling. And a heck of a lot better than it's increasingly ridiculous sequels might hint at.Dee Wallace stars as Karen White, an LA news reporter who is being stalked by an infamous serial killer. She agrees to take part in a scheme with the police and act as bait to draw the killer (called ""Eddie"") out of hiding. While the plan works and Eddie is killed, Karen is emotionally scarred by the event and begins to suffer amnesia and night terrors as a result. Her therapist sends her and her husband Bill out for a getaway to a therapeutic resort so she can get the help she needs to move on. However, things quickly turn sinister. The other residents of the resort are acting strangely, Eddie's body disappears from the morgue, and strange animalistic noises echo in the night... Soon, Karen will be forced to face a dark and dangerous presence in a fight for survival!Based on the popular novel and adapted by John Sayles and Terrence H. Winkless, the film is quite fascinating and often enthralling with it's plot developments and clever handling of tone and setting. Characters are all well-defined and there's a good sense of pacing that keeps the proceedings moving along. Director Dante, better known for features such as ""Gremlins"" and ""Explorers,"" does an excellent job, especially considering this is one of his earliest films. He creates a fantastic and oppressive atmosphere but also inserts a very subtle sense of comedy and playfulness with his subtle additions. There's some really nice in-jokes and some fun nods towards the old- fashioned cartoons that he so loves, and his camera-work is just a ton of fun and very quirky. The effects are for the most part also very good, especially when placed in the perspective of its time. The iconic transformation sequence still holds up to this day!The actors involved all do exceptionally well. Wallace is just a joy as our heroine, who is realistically portrayed in her psychological torment and is endlessly likable and identifiable. Patrick Macnee adds a nice sense of class with his role as Karen's counselor and therapist. Future Adam Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan does well in a supporting role as a co-worker of Karen's who is on a quest to help investigate the mysterious circumstances that are occurring. The late Elisabeth Brooks is seductive and frightening as a nymphomaniac who is obviously in on the dark goings-on. And the wonderful Robert Picardo wows in a supporting role as the serial- killer Eddie, who is so delightfully slimy and cruel, you can't help but love to hate him.However, despite all the praise I've sung, I do have to admit that this is a film of quite a few flaws, and I don't think it holds up quite as well as some other films of its era. To start, it's incredibly dated and has sort-of a kitschy quality when it comes to the way some scenes and effects are handled, which creates a bit of a rift for the audience. There's some bizarre directorial choices made that will leave one scratching their head, such as the insertion of an absolutely unnecessary and poorly animated shot in the middle of a key sequence that sticks out like a sore thumb. It's just ludicrous. Certain plot-points and twists are telegraphed from a mile away with no subtlety. And I can't help but feel that the final act (which I won't spoil) is a bit of a patchy mess that doesn't quite add up and has some bizarrely tonal shifts that may turn some viewers off.Still, those flaws can't change the fact that for the most part, ""The Howling"" is a resounding success and a very strong film. Solid direction, excellent performances, a fascinating storyline and for the most part top-notch effects make it a memorable and exciting horror experience. While the sequels it produced were often laughable and failed to come close to matching its quality, this original release remains a cult-classic for a reason. And so, I give Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" a very good 8 out of 10.",The Howling
84,m-47826,To each their own...,6,24 September 2021,"To me The Howling is a better movie than AWIL. I like the story better, and characters too. The creepy atmosphere fits perfectly the cheesy 80s tone. And that transformation scene is frightening. The opening scene is unsettling and I had nightmares of the Eddy Quist character, turning in the darkest corner, of the peep show booth. And Karen (Dee Wallace) reaction and face expression, were easy to relate to. The movie stalls with the whole Colony introduction, and everything leading up to the « sex in the woods » scene. But it helps for the setting of the scenery. Granted, the finale design of the werewolf is not of the nicest effect, there too. Can we say werekangaroos? But the attacks and chase scenes still get you. The finale showdown in the barn, is where it gets pretty silly, but not in an idiotic way. The thing with The Howling, is that the dark humor is never exaggerated or meant as true comical reliefs. So the scare remains intact. The last scene is intentionally sarcastic, though, and is a great conclusion to the movie. Unlike American Werewolf in London, this one is not trying so hard, and just do. Which makes it more efficient and my personal favorite for the genre. See which one is yours...",The Howling
85,Fernando-Rodrigues,Scream of HORROR,6,22 July 2021,"Extremely underrated. There are some minor flaws though, such as conveniences (the killer being related to the colony, for example), some weak performances, and the script loses its rhythm at some points (by hiding the creature until the 3d act and focusing on other plots, for example). It's not the best in werewolf horror, but it is definitely a classic.",The Howling
86,ODDBear,Good Werewolf flick,8,14 May 2009,"Somehow the werewolf mythos has only been sporadically successful in the horror genre. Of the old horror films; ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" have somehow come off better then ""The Wolf Man"" franchise and the concept of werewolfs didn't surface again until 1981. The old Hammer films successfully revived both Dracula and Frankenstein and a lot of horror films have dealt with vampirism and badly conceived monsters in the sixties and seventies.However, 1981 was a good year for werewolfs. ""An American Werewolf in London"" probably has more following than ""The Howling"", but I've always preferred this fright fest to the John Landis classic. One thing, though, that Joe Dante and John Landis have in common here; the both infuse their horror tales with big doses of humor. Here, Dante cleverly mixes old footage of Lon Chaney's ""Wolf Man"" and old cartoons (a frequent Dante thing) as a bleak forecast for what's about to happen.Another thing he does well here is mixing in a bit of social satire spoof (maybe he watched George Romero's Dead films) when he created a self help group in a recluse colony (which of course is where the werewolfs can enjoy their nature freely).But overall, ""The Howling"" is a pretty effective horror film. The werewolf transformations still look impressive and the final look of the creatures is still wonderfully creepy. The humor works well here and this is overall a fairly well written movie. It's got a knockout opening act and it maintains it's atmosphere fairly well throughout. The Colony is a beautiful setting for werewolf mayhem and some set pieces are terrific.Dante's direction is first rate and it's a shame he veered more into comical horrors (but I still love his Gremlins films). Performances are fine; Stone is always the same but Robert Picardo, Dick Miller and Kevin McCarthy are entertaining in their small roles.Good werewolf films are few and far between; but ""The Howling"" is a keeper and comes highly recommended for horror buffs.",The Howling
87,MrGKB,Thoroughly effective low-rent lycanthropy....,7,8 August 2012,"...and despite its failings, still one of my all-time favorite werewolf movies, Joe ""Piranha"" Dante's direction and John ""ditto"" Sayles' script are a hairy blend of E.C. Comics and a certain post-modern sensibility; this time the wily shape-shifters congregate at a rustic seaside retreat run by a new-agey shrink (Patrick ""The Avengers"" Macnee) who brings our heroine (Dee ""The Hills Have Eyes"" Wallace) there to ostensibly deal with the PTSD (as we millennials now call it) she's been suffering after an attack by one of the colony's more recalcitrant members (Robert ""This was my foot in the door!"" Picardo). Naturally the good doctor has an unorthodox sort of therapy in mind, and ultimately things don't quite work out for our lead, or her hubby (Christopher ""in real life, too!"" Stone), or a co-worker (Belinda ""I'm yet another Dante regular!"" Balaski), and ultimately the not-so-good doctor and most of his lupine cohort. The film is chock full of in-jokes & genre character actors, seasoned nicely with magnificent fx work from Rob ""where am I now?"" Bottin, and topped off with a requisite nubile femme fatale. It was a complete breath of fresh blood for a cinematic monster staple, paving the way another genre favorite, John Landis' ""An American Werewolf in London."" Both films have ardent fans to this day, and truly one is hard-pressed to say which is the more successful in accomplishing what it sets out to do. I tend to favor the more polished Landis film, but ""The Howling"" remains a quirky pleasure. It's hard to argue with a genre classic that includes the likes of Dick ""Bucket of Blood"" Miller, Slim ""Dr. Strangelove"" Pickens, Kevin ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" McCarthy, Kenneth ""The Thing From Another World"" Tobey, and John ""count 'em!""

This is one very slow developing story. First if you can become a werewolf by bite or scratch the world would be overrun with them. This one does have them as shape shifters and therefore not tied to the Hollywood stereotypical full moon only ability to change. I will admit that when they started the transformations it was done very well for the time period, no CGI there. Then you have reporter who shows up with (gasp) the magic silver bullets! There is goof here as he first jacks a bullet in to the chamber when he gets out of his car and then again when he is in the office. I do like when he shoots one of the werewolves that has the girl, they rest just stop and stare for a second. See what happens when you are supremely overconfident in your ability to be harmed? I do like the end where she changes on TV and then is shot and killed in full view of the audience. Of course few will believe!!!!",The Howling
89,jluis1984,Brilliant werewolf film!,8,17 March 2007,"Shapeshifters, the mythical creatures able to transform their bodies from human to the one of an animal, have been an important part of the world's folklore since the origin of mankind. Among those legendary creatures, werewolves have always been very popular, evolving to the point of being nowadays an icon of horror fiction thanks to the movies made about them. George Waggner's ""The Wolf Man"", starring Lon Chaney was probably the most influential of all, as almost single-handedly it created the basis for the modern werewolf's myths; however, in 1981 three movies appeared that revolutionized the werewolf in film, giving the creature a brand new set of fangs: Michael Wadleigh's ""Wolfen"", John Landis' ""An American Werewolf in London"", and this movie: Joe Dante's ""The Howling"". The fresh and original spin that these three movies gave to the werewolf's myths has proved to be enormously influential, and it's safe to say that 1981 was the year of the wolf.Dee Wallace plays Karen White, a journalist who has become the new target of infamous serial killer named ""Eddie"" (Robert Picardo). Working with the police in the case, she gets traumatized after a near fatal encounter with the killer (which ends with the police killing Eddie), so she is ordered to take a vacation in order to recover from the shock. In Dr. Waggner's (Patrick Macnee) colony, she finds some tranquility and relaxation, however, she also finds that something is wrong with the other inhabitants of the resort. Unfortunately, she can't count with her husband Bill (Christopher Stone), as he as been seduced by one of them (Elisabeth Brooks), breaking their marriage; however, this will be the lesser of her problems as she unveils the secret behind the Colony's existence and the true nature of its inhabitants.While the movie is based on Gary Brandner's novel of the same name, it has to be said that most of the film's charm comes actually from writer John Sayles (Dante's regular collaborator), who took on Terence H. Winkless's early screenplay and gave it his very own touch, adding a subtle spice of black comedy and nice tributes to the history of werewolves in film. However, not everything was changed from the novel, as Brandner's erotic and brutal re-imagining of the werewolf is still overtly present in the story, giving the film its characteristic sleaze. The plot is very well developed, playing with the natural mystery and suspense of Bradner's story, although it's safe to say that it lacks good development of several supporting characters. Still, it can be said that while different, John Sayles's version of ""The Howling"" is a nice adaptation of the now classic horror novel.Right after directing three of Roger Corman's better known cult classics from the 70s, director Joe Dante arrived to the project with his very own idea of what he wanted for the movie. Dante shows in ""The Howling"" a big talent for creating haunting atmospheres, as well as a complete understanding of the satirical tone of Sayles' (another of Corman's former protegés) script. Cleverly using a wide variety of special effects (from Rob Bottin's awesome make-up to different kinds of animation), Dante makes a wonderfully film that certainly looks better than movies with bigger budgets. However, in a film not everything is about good special effects, and Dante knows it, so he keeps his monsters hidden during most of the film's runtime, in order to effectively showing them up in a couple of remarkable climatic scenes.While nothing surprising, the cast as a whole is very effective and truly better than the average for horror movies. As Karen White, Dee Wallace delivers a very good performance and carries the film with dignity. Christopher Stone is one of the bad seeds in the cast, as his performance is probably the weakest of the movie, and actually hurts the film. Dennis Dugan and Belinda Balaski play Karen's friends, and both are excellent in their roles, specially Balaski. Among the supporting cast we find excellent performances by Patrick Macnee, Elisabeth Brooks and Don McLeod. Legendary actors John Carradine and Slim Pickens appear in small but memorable roles that like most characters are named after horror legends. Overall, one could say that despite some exceptions, the cast is quite good and manage to shine despite some poor development of minor characters.Like the ones used in Landis' film, the special effects of ""The Howling"" are without a doubt some of the most celebrated works in this filed, and certainly one of the highlights of the movie. While a bit too dark (and oddly with that glossy, shiny look so typical of the 80s films), cinematography by John Hora is appropriate, as it gives the story a nightmarish surreal look, similar to the one given to 1941's classic ""The Wolf Man"". Pino Donaggio's original score for the movie is good, although sometimes too eclectic, with some parts working perfectly while others feeling definitely out of place in the story. Sadly, even when ""The Howling"" is definitely an almost flawless film, it has earned a terrible reputation due to the awful quality of its sequels, which have gone downhill ever since ""The Howling II"" was released. Among horror fans there is always the question about which of the three werewolf movies of 1981 is the truly best, and while personally I feel inclined to say that ""An American Werewolf in London"" is the one, Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" is, in my opinion, a very underrated classic that despite the constant release of bad sequels, has kept its magic intact all those years. This film is really top-notch horror, and a movie worth to check out, not only for horror fans. 8/10",The Howling

It was filmed and released the same year as was An American Werewolf in London my number 2 favorite werewolf horror film this is the third one that I love to death!A hip, well-made horror film brimming with film-buff jokes and amazing wolf transformations!This is still one of my favorite werewolf films, it isn't a great movie but the effects, directing and acting are really solid. Now, I do admit that there are a couple missed opportunities regarding the werewolves screen time-wise, like they could've shown some earlier in the film. But still, it's a pretty good film. This movie got a several sequels which I don't care for but I am going to give a second chance to see Howling II: Stirba - Werewolf Bitch (1985) because it has a good theme score.He film is about a television newswoman (Dee Wallace) sent to a remote mountain resort after a fatal incident with a serial killer, unaware that the inhabiting residents are werewolves. First and for most this is THE werewolf movie that started it all Besides American Werewolf in London (classic by the way) but this is a true werewolf horror. What a cast!!! The lovely delightful Dee Wallace oh my god, she was everyone's favorite movie mom (ET) The special effects (c'mon people for its time 1980/1981) great editing, amazing creepy music, weird people, a very secluded setting.. werewolf's!! Need I say more!! Anyone who knows horror films understands ""The Howling"" was a ground breaking film, and not just for the cutting edge SFX (for the time) that still holds up today.What I love about this film is beautiful actress Belinda Balaski as Terry Fisher who sees the island that a serial killer (Eddie Robert Picardo) drew, she run to the cabin and she fight off the werewolf, she chopped a werewolf's hand with an ax what a shocker. In this movie you have a pack of werewolf's who kill's people and Dee Wallece has to fight for her own life. I love the transformation of werewolf's in this film, I love the character Chris Halloran (Dennis Dugan) shooting werewolf's with a silver bullets. Chris bolts werewolf's inside of barn and together, Karen and Chris pour gasoline all around the barn and set it on fire and kills the rest of the werewolf's this a bad ass scene and the best one in the movie!I love the howling in this movie, Karen and Chris are surrounded in the car by group of werewolf's and they hardly escape. Karen is bitten by werewolf wow I love this movie. I love the music score by Pino Donaggio and mostly I love the acting by Dee Wallace.The film won the 1980 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film while still in development, and was one of the three high-profile wolf-themed horror films released in 1981, alongside An American Werewolf in London and Wolfen. Over the years, The Howling has accumulated a cult following. Its financial success aided Joe Dante's career, and prompted Warner Bros. To hire Dante (as director) and Michael Finnell (as producer) for Gremlins. A franchise consisting of seven sequels arose from the film's success.The Howling (1981) is my second personal favorite werewolf horror slasher film in the horror genre I love this movie 10 out of 10 it is wisely scary and it is also intelligent film.",The Howling
91,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Nicely done,7,7 July 2008,"Horror is one of my favorite genres due to the fact that many of it's stories have interesting subtexts. A sort of story just beneath the story that you are watching. A good and well developed subtext makes the film deeper, and prevents it from being pretentious since if you just want to have fun and watch a monster movie, you can go right ahead. ""The Howling"" is that type of monster movie - one that can be watched for pure fun and tension, but there are a few interesting subtle things that might strike you and cause you to re-watch the film... and notice more of them! Naturally, giving them away would be spoiling your fun, so I'll leave that to you.On the surface this is also a pretty good movie. Featuring some great creature effects that still look better than most CGI. There is key scene of human-to-werewolf transformation that lasts around 2 minutes, maybe more, that is the pinnacle of the film's special effects. Slowly but surely we see muscles expanding, teeth growing, and of course, lots of hair! It is a great moment and a great example classic special effects. Though I am not so sure I'd just stand and watch for 2 minutes as some guy turned into a werewolf right in front of me! But that's not important, what is that the film entertains and even provides a few twists and spares the excess see all too often today. --- 7/10BsCDb classification: Ages 13+ -- violence, sexual content",The Howling
92,Ben_Cheshire,Joe Dante got it right with Gremlins. This one? Not so much.,1,26 July 2015,"Big fan of Gremlins, and always heard tell of how good The Howling was. Problem was I'd never been able to get more than 30 mins into it without something annoying me so badly I had to rage quit. Well, I finally got through it. Right to the end and yeah, it isn't for me. Not sure what the budget was on this thing, but man oh man does it look bad. Its shot with soft lighting, and not enough lighting, and most of the time looks like Vaseline was on the lens. I think its a technique to mask the low budget special effects. Also, the famous transformation scene which I finally got to goes on for like two minutes too long and isn't that interesting. I prefer the Rat in From Dusk Till Dawn, at least he doesn't mess around. Having recently watched E.T. again I think I've identified my major problem with The Howling. Poor Dee Wallace, who also plays E.T.'s mother, is on screen most of the time, and she's just not a good actress. She's more convincing here than in E.T. but really she just doesn't sell any of it. And that really pulls a picture down when your protagonist, your anchor, just doesn't convince or draw you in. So, yeah. While probably landmark in 1983, The Howling is one I've always struggled to get through, tried to force myself to like, but at the end of the day its a movie its not homework, you don't have to like it. If I had to pinpoint the other main thing that frustrated me about The Howling it would be that the actual werewolves don't do get to do much. They spend so long transforming its like that's all they're good for. Its pretty funny when you think about it. Again, a question of what was possible with the special effects, but earlier films did more. Nosferatu (1922) and Dracula (1931) are incredible to this day. The Howling (1983) is not. Its funny, maybe the genre just isn't for me. I can't think of a single werewolf movie I've liked except the remake to American Werewolf, and that one probably just hit me because I saw it at the right age, in the cinema. Maybe there's a time for werewolves, and you only get one chance. Its like falling in love.",The Howling
93,RonellSowes,No Comparison,4,30 September 2021,"The Howling has definetly one of the more original and unorthodox spins on werewolf flicks, but like a great deal of movies with unusual loglines it doesn't have much else to offer than its premise.The entire picture feels only half thought out and as if there were two stories for the same concept that were finally mashed together into one. It does a poor job of establishing its lead(or any of its characters) or direction, and the entire pace of the movie jolts between dragging and rushed. All the while, with the style and quality of a made for television movie from the seventies.The Howling was released at around the same time as An American Werewolf In London and the two have been endlessly compared since. I hardly see a comparison. AAWIL surpasses The Howling by every measure(somehow even visual effects) and offers so much more than this movie ever thinks of. If you've never seen either, skip this watch the other.",The Howling

Karen's doctor (Patrick Macnee) convinces her that she and husband Bill (Christopher Stone) should go through his treatment at ""The Colony."" Strange things start to happen as soon as they arrive. Could Karen be cracking up or is there something sinister going on in the secluded resort?Like most movies from the 1970s and the 1980s, ""The Howling"" is a slow- burner. This isn't one of those horror films that starts with a bang, keeps a frantic pace, and goes out with a bang. It slowly establishes its plot and characters and gives the audience a little at a time until the climactic and shocking end. Things might move too slowly for today's impatient audience. I even found it tedious at times. The scenes get choppy throughout and it seems like director Joe Dante was rushing things at some points.Rob Bottin's special effects for ""The Howling"" are still just as effective today as they were in 1981. The werewolf transformation scenes are unnerving and quite detailed. One transformation takes what seems like three to four minutes. It's all about attention to detail when it comes to Bottin's practical effects and animatronics versus today's obsession with rapid fire CGI scenes of metamorphosis.""The Howling"" does feature quite a bit of the usual unnecessary nudity found in 1980's horror films. However, this time around director Dante attempts to justify it by analyzing our need to let the beast within out, mostly through sexual and physical acts of violence. The doctor, played by the late Patrick Macnee, convincingly regurgitates a lot of ""primal scream"" mumbo jumbo throughout the movie.Although it's a bit slow and takes some time getting started, great special effects and interesting, albeit hokey, social commentary set ""The Howling"" apart from the normal monster movie fare.",The Howling

The screenplay is pretty strong, but I think you just have to tell Joe Dante what kind of picture you want and he'll make it. Great score by Pino Donggio and solid cinematography from John Hora. Rob Bottin's special effects and werewolf make-up's are outstanding.

Joe Dante's dark and unique horror story is a different take of the Lyncanthrope myth other then your basic Hollywood retelling of the stories. The Werewolves in this movie can change at anytime and not just during the night, Rob Bottin's make-up effects are amazing and still is today. Joe Dante's direction is fantastic even the performances by Wallace with John Carrdain, Slim Pickens and Dick Miller.

100,LoneWolfAndCub,Way better than expected; one of the better werewolf films,7,17 March 2008,"I have never been a fan of the werewolf sub-genre, in fact, there are only three other werewolf films I would rate highly. 'The Wolf Man,' 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'Dog Soldiers.' After ages of putting this one off I finally bit the bullet and put it in. I am glad I did. Joe Dante's 'The Howling' is not only a great werewolf movie, it is a really good movie. Featuring a great performance by Dee Wallace, some excellent transformation scenes and gore and some genuinely weird settings this is a a genre-defining movie. My attention was immediately drawn from the start and not once was I looking at my watch or waiting for the end. The story is interesting and is very evenly paced and the creepy woods setting (with some atmospheric fog to boot) kept me tense throughout. Moreover, when the first transformation scene occurred (during sex by a campfire!) I was even more engaged.Joe Dante's direction and sly sense of humour probably helped this movie quite a bit, though. Especially with the ending, which was tragic and although out of place (for me, anyway) did suit the movie. Overall, 'The Howling' was surprisingly good and features one of the coolest transformation scenes I have ever seen! 3½/5",The Howling

It's about to become a hairy situation!Writer John Sayles (who does a humorous cameo as a morgue attendant) makes The Howling a clever and deeply spooky picture with some nicely tongue-in-cheek humor. The story references lots of old-school horror movies, notice how many of the characters in this movie are named after directors of old werewolf films. Dante lends some well-crafted direction, giving the movie a truly haunting atmosphere. He builds some great suspense and the occasional good shock. The art direction by Robert Burns is also quite good, making for some creepy settings. Rob Bottin's makeup FX are impressive and frightening. Pino Donaggio's music score is splendidly dramatic.Dee Wallace Stone does a strong performance as the film's troubled heroine. Patrick Macnee, Dennis Dugan, Belinda Balaski, and Christoper Stone are also good in their supporting roles. Elisabeth Brooks and Robert Picardo make for some truly scary villains.Along with Landis's great American Werewolf in London, which ironically came out the same year as this film, The Howling ranks as one of the very best modern werewolf movies!**** out of ****",The Howling

From cool and for the time advanced transformation scenes, clever and imaginative visuals to good soundtrack and decent acting. But where ""Howling"" fails is where it's main strength should be. Lead heroine isn't really that memorable and while you do feel sympathy for her, you never really feel too scared for her. There isn't really that feeling of dread or even a long and nerve wrecking chase scene. I liked Terry far more than Karen and would have liked her better in the main role. Also, problem with horror movies including monsters is that one day it will look old and not really scary and that is understandable and the movie shouldn't be bashed because of that, but in the same time we have to admit it isn't scary. I give it 7/10 and I DO recommend it, because it really is crafted with love and care and you will enjoy it, because it is, after all, a good and fun movie.",The Howling

This was Joe Dante's first good movie, he later went on to do ""Gremlins"" and ""Innerspace"".  Dee Wallace gives a decent performance, shes very cute with longer hair.

Poor John Carradine, his arthritis is really bad in this one. There are some minor character issues and without giving it away the ending was less then perfect.

Hoping to conquer her inner demons, she heads for The Colony, a secluded retreat where the creepy residents are a little too eager to make her feel at home. Also, there seems to be a bizarre connection between Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo) and this supposedly safe haven. And when, after nights of being tormented by unearthly cries, Karen ventures into the forest and makes a terrifying discovery. Now she must not only fight for her life... but for her very soul!...Based on the novel by Gary Brandner, one has to say the The Howling is one of the best werewolf films ever made and as a horror film is just a pleasant viewing experience from the nostalgic '80s. Joe Dante works his movie perfectly, giving us creepy situations, funny moments to enlighten the audience and a cast of whos who actors mostly cameos from well known genre actors like Dick Miller, John Carradine and a cameo by Roger Corman to veteran actors like Patrick Macnee, Slim Pickens, and Noble Willingham, and you cant leave out Robert Picardo as the psychotic Eddie Quist and the late Elizabeth Brooks as his sultry sister Marsha Quist, also Dee Wallace and late husband Christopher Stone do just fine as our two main leads. But, what really makes The Howling shine is its special effects started by Rick Baker who left for An American Werewolf in London (1981) and finished by Rob Bottin, while most of the stop motion effects used look outdated today, the transformation scene is still nasty and bets the hell out of any CGI crap seen today. The film itself isn't loaded down really with violence, even tho its a horror film its there, but, you can tell they were trying to go into a classic horror format instead of the blood and guts routine, but, there is some good nudity from Elizabeth Banks character. My only complaint about the movie in general is that it takes awhile to get going at the beginning, but, stay with it and I promise you you'll will love it. All in all, The Howling is just a all around good horror film and a great werewolf film, it is often compared with Joe Landis An American Werewolf in London (1981) which probably is a step higher, but, lacks the grittiness as Landis film is meant to be a horror/comedy. Fans of both the horror and werewolf genres should definitely check out both titles, if not your missing and real treat. Also for reading fans I've read the book and it is very good I recommend it if your into reading.",The Howling
107,charchuk,One great scene does not a good movie make,4,13 May 2007,"I really didn't like it. Werewolf flicks are usually my thing, but I found this one rather silly and oddly paced. I also didn't catch the supposed tongue-in-cheek humour at all. The story is rather weird, and really doesn't fit the film at all, and the acting is uniformly terrible. There's no hint of character development or even shades of anything more than slight stereotypes, and thus it becomes just another slasher flick. Also, by the time this film starts going, it's nearly over, as there's too much build-up and not enough payoff. The makeup effects are admittedly impressive, and the much-ballyhooed transformation scene is quite a treat to watch, but one great scene does not a good movie make. The end is kinda cool, I guess, but, again, doesn't fit the film. It's not terrible, but it's not that good either. Quite a disappointment for me.",The Howling

Oh, there are some cheesy track-through-the-cocktail-party setups, and the movie really should have given us a few minutes to get to know Dee Wallace BEFORE she became a nervous wreck. But I like how the husband is this mustachioed vegetarian lunkhead, basically useless, and I like how good old John Sayles' script combines werewolves and encounter groups without making it into a Metaphor for Society or anything. It's just a smart jape - evidently Dante's specialty - as evidenced by the preponderance of movie insider gags, including characters named David Hewitt and Sam Newfield and a cameo where Roger Corman checks the pay phone for change. The effects are great. And it's lovely to see Carradine in a quality production, the old coot looks like he's having a really good time.",The Howling

110,mnpollio,One of the last great werewolf films,8,30 January 2012,"After a drought of werewolf films, 1981 saw the arrival of two very successful werewolf films with The Howling and An American Werewolf in London. For my money, I have always found The Howling to be the more inventive, ambitious and satisfying of the two films.As the film opens, L.A. has been victimized by a series of brutal murders and the perpetrator has offered to meet with frightened TV news reporter Dee Wallace. The police sting goes slightly awry with the killer ostensibly dead and Wallace shell-shocked from the ordeal. TV psychologist Patrick Macnee recommends that she ""recharge her batteries"" at his quaint woodsy retreat dubbed ""The Colony"". While Wallace and husband Christopher Stone deal with their new surroundings and the eccentric personalities at The Colony, friends/work colleagues Dennis Dugan and Belinda Balaski continue the investigation into the killer and find it suspiciously leading straight to The Colony.The Howling seems forever doomed to be unappreciated when compared to the later An American Werewolf in London. Although it opened first and broke ground with its werewolf transformation sequences, AWIL came later and got all of the glory and Oscar love. The effects here are nothing short of amazing and the fact that decades later they seem infinitely more impressive than the crummy CGI transformation effects propagating wildly is even more of a tribute to them.The film boasts a solid, literate screenplay filled with quirky humor by the wonderful John Sayles. The humor is such that it never slows the film down and does not necessarily need to be commented on, but sharp-eyed viewers and film aficionados will have much to chuckle over without the chills being compromised. Joe Dante's first-rate direction is also a plus. He provides some great atmosphere - whether it be the seedy porn shop where Wallace and the killer first meet or the mist-shrouded lonely woods filled with who-knows-what creeping terror. There are a number of good jolts and suspenseful sequences. The film also crafts some incredibly appealing characters - with the downside being that something dreadful seems to happen to far too many of them.The cast is great. Old pros like John Carradine, Kevin McCarthy and Slim Pickens are on hand, usually playing characters named after directors of past werewolf films. The normally humorous Robert Picardo is terrifying as the demented killer, Eddie. Elisabeth Brooks is both sultry and menacing as the literal man-eater Marsha. Macnee is truly inspirational casting as the pop psychologist who knows more than he lets on. As the central characters, Wallace, Stone, Dugan and Balaski are all sympathetic and appealing. Balaski's mid-film duel with a nasty werewolf is especially adrenaline pumping and it is a shame that the actress has rarely been given a chance to shine in other roles.Watching the film more than three decades after its premiere, it is amazing how well it holds up - both visually and narratively. For my money, this was the last great werewolf film and the subsequent imitators (not to mention an army of increasingly laughable sequels) come off as so much detritus.",The Howling
111,benoit-3,Oh so inept...,1,29 August 2003,"I know there must be some perfectly acceptable reasons why a film like `The Howling' was financed and produced and was considered at the time it came out a good film by at least some people. But these reasons hardly seem believable in retrospect. What I saw on the DVD edition that came out this week is a third-rate, somewhat pretentious (despite its low budget) student film, very mediocre acting, photography reminiscent of a never-ending soft-focus Miss Clairol hair conditioner commercial, an absence of spectator involvement, pace, story arc and character development (nothing happens until minute 42 of the 91 minutes), so-so special effects and irritatingly inept attempts to quote Hitchcock's editing and Bernard Herrmann's music. I could go on but the gist of the thing is these were the longest 91 minutes I have ever cringed through in front of my television, mostly because of the incredibly shallow characters and their lack of motivation and despite a timid attempt at soft porn, half way through the picture, which does not even succeed in sustaining interest for more than a minute. In other words, a film very much of its time, that doesn't age well, and a harbinger of many, many even worse gore for gore's sake pictures to come. Besides which, 1980 must have been the very worst year in a long time for ugly hairdos, unflattering clothes in dismal pastel shades, ugly interior decorating, ugly graphics, ugly design, ugly cars, slack-jawed acting and ugly, meaningless, inarticulate dialogue. The real question one must ask oneself is how could such an inept film have been made in the very same year and on the same subject as `An American Werewolf in London' which has everything that is lacking from `The Howling'  mostly class, believability, suspense and atmosphere - and looks positively timeless by comparison.",The Howling
112,Thrashman88,Werewolf Terror,8,29 September 1998,"The Howling was a surprisingly good horror film which combined humor with some decidedly gruesome violence. Rob Bottin´s transformation make up was pretty outstanding, not to mention downright scary. A lot of people argue about which werewolf film was better; either ""The Howling"" or ""An American Werewolf in London"", both of which were released in 1981, about 5 months apart from each other. Although ""American Werewolf"" was a landmark (receiving the award for best make up, the academy´s newest category), the impact of being ""first"" cannot be denied. This was indeed, despite the humor elements, a very scary movie that still holds up quite well even today. Pino Donaggio´s music score is richly symphonic and terrifying.

115,TheRedDeath30,One of the Best of the 80s,10,30 October 2016,"I am a horror connoisseur. I watch a whole lot of horror movies. My favorite mini-genre of horror is the werewolf film. I have been obsessed with werewolves since I was a little guy. Unfortunately, I probably can't even come up with 20 great werewolf movies. Though Hollywood has glutted us with vampire and zombie flicks, the werewolf remains a rarity. I believe part of that is the struggle people seem to have to craft a unique werewolf story. The other part is the challenge of presenting a believable werewolf makeup that looks good. Joe Dante was able to accomplish both of these things (with help from Rob Bottin, of course).Dee Wallace (who is gorgeous in this movie) is a news reporter who has been receiving phone calls from a serial killer named Eddie Quist. She helps the police to set up a sting operation to try to capture Quist, but it doesn't go as planned and she is almost killed before the police save the day and kill Quist (or did they?). Now, she has memory blocks and nightmares, so her shrink advises her to go to a new age camp to get the help she needs. Only there is much more to this camp that it seems and it might just be a village full of werewolves.What Dante does well to begin with, story-wise, is to avoid the origin story. This was a prerequisite of most werewolf movies before this, that all followed the blueprint created in WEREWOLF OF London. Hero gets bit by werewolf, hero becomes werewolf, movie focuses on the tragedy of his/ her situation. Literally, they pretty much all followed that blueprint until THE HOWLING. By bringing us something fresh, Dante brought something new to the formula that has helped it to stand the test of time.Dante, also, crams this movie full of easter eggs for fans. Beginning with the casting choices. Kenneth Tobey (the hero of THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD) is a cop in the beginning. Patrick Macnee as the doctor. John Carradine as an aging werewolf. Slim Pickens as the sheriff. Even more so are the myriad werewolf references. Go through the list of character names and you will notice that almost all of them are named for directors of classic werewolf pictures. The backgrounds are full of little wolf references, from the books they read to the chili they eat, it's like a Where's Waldo of werewolf lore and so fun for a werewolf nut like myself to dig through each time.The makeup is maybe my favorite werewolf design of all time. Most early films used the ""hairy guy"" approach (think WEREWOLF OF London or THE WOLFMAN) where we get a guy on two legs with some extra yak hair. There was the cheap way out of using an actual dog (THE BEAST MUST DIE) or even AN American WEREWOLF IN London uses a creature that is basically just a dog. When I imagine a werewolf in my nightmares, neither are the monster I see. It should be an almost perfect amalgamation of the two creatures and THE HOWLING gives us that. Rob Bottin created something damn near perfect for this movie that I still haven't seen topped (DOG SOLDIERS comes close). If I have one nitpick it is the ears, which are too large, but I'm being too picky now.The film keeps the action tight and the suspense at a maximum. We start to realize that there are more than one monster in these woods and it adds a terror of not just the werewolf(s) at the door, but the very fact that the heroes are up against an entire colony, adding that one vs all mentality that brings a whole new level to the plot complexion. It all wraps up in one heck of a climax.There are weak spots, brought about mostly from the limitations of the budget. The animation in the sex scene is really bad. It was bad then and looks even worse now. The claymation used in the final chase is, also, very obvious. It's not EVIL DEAD bad, but it's not good either. Still, these small moments do not take away from the mastery of the special effects on display in this movie.It's a shame that the movie will, really, forever live in the shadow of AN American WEREWOLF. Being released in the same year as what is, admittedly, a superior movie it never got a fair shake, but this movie remains one of the 5 best werewolf films of all time and one of the greatest horror films released in the 80s.",The Howling
116,zmaturin,An American Werewolf in a Crappy Movie,1,22 October 2001,"This tedious and dull movie from the director of ""Small Soldiers"" stars the perpetually-depressed-looking Dee Wallace-Stone as a TV news anchor who is attacked by werewolf in a porno theater (not to be confused by the superior werewolf in a porno theater scene in ""An American Werewolf in London""). Professor John Steed recommends she go up to his groovy commune for character actors to recover from her trauma, despite the fact that it means spending time with John Carradine. Nothing of any interest happened for most of the film's running time until a lengthy werewolf-transformation scene full of masturbatorial shots of sub-par make-up effects and an over-abundance of air-bladders (""An American Werewolf in London"" features a much better transformation scene). Once the wererabbits show up things get a little better and the final scene is really good, but not so good as to excuse the lethargic and pointless first hour and twenty minutes of this stinkburger. It does have a lot of fun actors, most reduced to cameos, including Patrick Mcnee, Kevin McCarthy, Roger Corman, Forrest Ackerman, Dick Miller, Slim Pickens, Robert Picardo, and director Joe Dante himself. Also includes a scene where people's knowledge of werewolves is taken from Lon Chaney, jr's ""The Wolf Man"" (you know, like in ""An American Werewolf in London"").",The Howling
117,happyendingrocks,"A smart, sexy, and genuinely scary horror classic that still has plenty of bite",9,17 October 2012,"The werewolf is sort of the neglected middle child of the horror monster hierarchy: gifted, unique, and brilliant, but eternally overshadowed by its dad the Devil, older vampiric siblings, mummified Egyptian stepsons from a previous marriage, and kid brother zombies who are always getting into trouble and keeping the family distracted. Of course there have been great, even legendary, films with lycanthrope antagonists, but that particular sub-genre is rather limited in scope. However, despite the admitted paucity of competition, I can still say with absolute certainty that The Howling is the best movie about werewolves ever made.It makes sense that the film heavily references The Wolf Man, the eternal Lon Chaney Jr./Universal Monsters staple, because The Howling is executed in a way that clearly reveals its acknowledgment of its roots in the traditions of classic horror. The pace is restrained and meticulous, the atmosphere is a character in itself, and despite the film's utilization of creature effects that weren't even dreamed of in Universal's genre heyday, good old-fashioned ensemble acting is what truly drives the action in the piece. If this description makes The Howling sound like a dry production more suited for the theater stage, don't misunderstand me; this is bloody and ferocious fare that will greatly please fans of visceral horror. But it is the taut and well-crafted story, not merely the FX, that make this such a gem, and director Joe Dante is seasoned enough here to allow a gradual and steady immersion into the film's world before bowling us over with Rob Bottin's peerless set-pieces, which have all the more impact when they take command because of how effectively the movie has teased us with tantalizing glimpses throughout.Though the creatures are understandably a feature attraction here, the main focus of the plot is on news anchor Karen White, who has become the fixation of deranged serial killer Eddie Quist and agrees to be used as bait as part of a police operation to capture him. Quist is seemingly killed during her harrowing and macabre encounter, and Karen is subsequently haunted by bizarre dreams and fuzzy, repressed recollections of what actually occurred that night. When she heeds a pop psychologist's suggestion that she and her husband should attend a therapy retreat he oversees at a secluded commune, the getaway does anything but assuage her trauma. Instead, Karen encounters odd and subtly menacing locals and the titular unholy moans emanating from the fog-shrouded forests. It doesn't take long for us to learn that the commune is located at the nucleus of the hunting grounds prowled by a pack of malevolent predatory beasts, and after Karen's husband is seduced and transformed by a sultry lady wolf, her and her visiting reporter friend begin to uncover the sinister secret of the commune.I'll refrain from stepping up on my soapbox to deliver an impassioned soliloquy about how CGI has ruined the art of special make-up FX, but those who appreciate the magic of the wizards who revolutionized the art-form in the late '70s and early '80s will find the work of Rob Bottin here absolutely awe-inspiring. The climactic transformation scene is delivered unflinchingly and in real time, step by grotesque step, and the result is an indelible sequence that remains far more impressive and enthralling than anything modern film-makers handling the same material could ever cook up on a computer. The gore is used sparingly for maximum impact, but whenever it arrives, the results are stunning and gruesome. Perhaps most importantly, the werewolves themselves are a thing of fearsome beauty to behold, monsters that resonate as wholly believable extensions of the established mythology while still maintaining an innovative stroke of originality that makes them belong to this film alone. These creatures aren't merely big wolves, they are eight-foot tall bipedal killing machines with fangs and claws capable of tearing people to shreds, a skill that they demonstrate with acute proficiency during the course of the movie.The performances are all excellent even when the roles veer into the melodramatic, and the presence of one of the power couples of '80s horror, Christopher Stone and Dee Wallace (later Dee Wallace Stone), as well as a marvelous extended cameo from beloved genre vet Dick Miller, will delight fans of the era. Both the gritty, sleazy streets that open the movie and the isolated location housing the commune complex are perfectly presented and utilized, the clues to the greater mystery are unfolded with the taut grace of a top-notch thriller, and the film as a whole feels like an entirely plausible representation of ancient folk lore-based creatures existing in a modern world.The denouement falters slightly since Bottin's best tricks have already been displayed, but the sentiment of the finale is striking enough to end the saga on a dark and tragic note. If your love of the genre goes back to its natal days, be sure to stick around after the credits too, where you'll find a nice coda that bookends the homage to The Wolf Man present throughout these reels.The Howling is, in my estimation, not only the finest and most enduring lycanthropy fable in the canon, it's also quite simply one of the best horror films of all time. Don't skip this one.",The Howling
118,MonsterVision99,Pretty good werewolf movie.,8,19 October 2017,"""The Howling"" came out around the same time as ""American Werewolf in London"" and its often compared to the Landi's werewolf film, and I think its kinda of unfair, I enjoy ""Werewolf in London"" more than I enjoy ""The Howling"" but ""The Howling"" still manages to be a really effective and fun horror movie.It may not be as memorable or as riveting as ""American Werewolf in London"" and it may be dull at times but its mostly entertaining, the effects are amazing, it has good performances, its well directed, well written and its well paced. It takes influence from many werewolf films and blends all those elements together to make something original, something all great filmmakers do.overall, a great werewolf movie, its almost as good as ""Piranha"", quite amusing and engaging.",The Howling
119,ryan-10075,Great Funny Werewolf Flick,8,4 November 2019,"This might be if not my favourite werewolf movie is right up there on a very short list. Joe Dante after scaring audiences in going into the water (much like Steven Spielberg before him) with PIRANHA he was given the chance to direct a werewolf movie. Based on a novel by Gary Brandner, which I have read and I must say the film is (and this is rare) way better than the book. Screenwriter John Sayles (who also has a cameo in this film) was brought in to rewrite a script by Terence H. Winkless. What he did was add wonderful humour, characters and nods to horror that werewolf fans should enjoy.Dee Wallace plays Karen White, who is a news reporter. Wallace I think does a great job in the role and is really able to effectively play the character she is portraying. She is on the trail of an LA serial killer called Eddie Quist (super creepy and dark portrayal by Robert Picardo). She is almost killed by Quist, so her shrink Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee) suggests she go to a retreat where he sends some of his patients for treatment. So, Karen along with her husband (played by her real-life hubby Christopher Stone in a great performance) to the retreat. Problem is this is where the Quist family lives along with a gang of werewolves.I really do think this early 80s horror flick is wonderfully lit, excellent use of fog and also has some awesome music from Italian composer Pino Donaggio.1981 was the year of the werewolf movie as John Landis' AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (which is generally held in an even higher regard by most) and WOLFEN came out that same year. Rob Bottin did the effects for this movie and I think only 21 at the time shows how marvellous he was at creating special effects as this was I think the very first on-screen transformation into a werewolf in film history. Now some of the effects in the film have not aged the best, but some stand wonderfully as they did when the film was first released.There are also some cameos in the film such as Dante's old boss Roger Corman, Famous Monster magazine founder Forrest J. Ackerman and future horror director Mick Garris. Also has quite a great cast including Dennis Dugan, Kevin McCarthy, John Carradine and Slim Pickens to name a few.So, if you are a werewolf fan, enjoy some humour mixed in with your horror and like the old ways horror flicks were made with effects I would highly suggest watching this film. Sadly, followed by an endless parade of bad sequels.",The Howling
120,quaseprovisorio,it starts slowly but it's pure fun at its conclusion,8,23 March 2020,"I never understood why joe dante's movies are so unfairly rated here. Not even a 7? Most of his movies are great, they show how passionate he is about cinema, how he wants the viewer to be engaged and fascinated about what he's seeing. The special effects are great in general, and we're talking about 1981. It starts slowly, not in a boring way but a bit slowly, and it builds the atmosphere throughout the first hour. The last half an hour it's just pure fun that you see with a smile in your eyes, laughing and being scared at the same time.It's just that type of movie where you get what you're waiting for, and your expectations are in place. Joe Dante knows how to build an amosphere, how to make the characters scary but not terrifying and mostly what i really love about it is how he's committed to the amusement of the audience. I liked this one as much as an american werewolf in london. It's not my favourite joe dante movie (i think matinee still wins) but it's cinema gold. Go and check it, it does deserve it. Dante is one of the most underrated directors ever,",The Howling
121,brefane,You won't be howling with laughter.,4,31 October 2005,"Watchable, but disappointing. I expected the film to be more tongue in cheek. The Howling is short of wit,invention, scares,suspense or compelling characterizations. Except for the special effects, gore, and nudity;this feels like a made-for-TV movie. Yes, it is a B movie, but that doesn't excuse the unimaginative direction and the generally uninspired acting. You don't really care about the characters and they are often frustratingly and unbelievably clueless. I'm not a fan of An American Werewolf in London, but it was more sophisticated, had better FXs, and appeared to be professionally made. In comparison, The Howling seems amateurish. Unfortunately, little about The Howling is really memorable; it pretty much evaporates like the phony mist featured in the film.

122,freaky_dave,A Very good werewolf film,8,11 March 2005,"The Howling was a monster movie that was a pleasant surprise for me in particular. I loved the story and the setting which works perfectly for the werewolf myth. The special effects were astounding for their time, and most people who love horror movies still remember those effects 24 years later. Joe Dante's directing of the movie is slow at first but quickly picks up pace during the last half, starting with an incredible scene around a campfire. For those who saw the movie, you will know what scene I'm talking about. The acting could've been better, but I guess it's adequate for a movie like this. It's better than the acting in all of the Friday the 13th films put together, and I'm sure most will agree with me on that point. Along with An American Werewolf In London, The Howling is one of my all time favorite werewolf films so far. Neither one is great, but both are enjoyable nonetheless, with The Howling edging out American Werewolf In London in my opinion.",The Howling

Patrick Macnee is a doctor that has a retreat unbeknown to anyone is that it is for werewolves. Dr Waggner suggests that reporter Karen White ""Dee Wallace"" and her husband Bill need a time-out in the retreat. It seems that a killer is obsessed with her. This killer is shot and killed apparently but his body disappears. Denis Dugan is Karen's friend ""Chris"" and fellow worker at the studio and plays detective into the mystery of the killer and Karen. One very clever moment happens as Chris is watching an old movie and on the phone he is told that Karen's husband has been bitten by a wolf, Chris turns his head to the words of an old gypsy telling Lon Chaney Jr alias Larry Talbot that any man bitten by a werewolf will become a werewolf. The howling scenes of the killer changing into a werewolf is truly an ""eye-catcher."" Chris didn't tell the killer that his gun is loaded with ""silver bullets"" provided by Dick Miller, much to the displeasure of the werewolf. Supporting actors are wonderful also Slim Pickens and John Carradine as werewolves and Kevin McCarthy as TV director.

125,Casey-52,Classic werewolf movie that deserves a re-release,10,11 March 2000,"I have raved about Dee Wallace before in my ""Hills Have Eyes"" review and I will here again. Dee Wallace is definitely one of the Top 10 actresses in horror/sci-fi/cult films EVER! Her girl-next-door looks, her signature voice, and her pert acting skills make her what could be the blueprint for THE horror film heroine!Anyway, ""The Howling"" is a film that any horror fan should see at least once. The movie is filled with quirky in-jokes for the serious horror movie buff, including appearances by legends such as John Carradine, Patrick Macnee, Dick Miller, Kevin McCarthy, and Forrest J. Ackerman. I have heard that Roger Corman makes an appearance, too, but I have yet to spot him. I just wish that Carradine and McCarthy had gotten more screen time!Scenes to watch for: the stalking of Belinda Balaski by a werewolf intercut with similar scenes from a cartoon; a nude sex scene between Christopher Stone and Elisabeth Brooks; the transformation of the serial rapist/killer Eddie to his lycanthropic alter ego; and the right-out-of-left-field trick ending! Believe me, you will NOT expect it! While ""The Howling"" does not have tons of gory werewolf murders, the special effects are top-notch and stand up well today, the acting is all around fantastic, the scenes in the woods (both day and night) are wonderfully sinister, and the storyline (a TV report goes to a psychiatric retreat) is something unique and is carried off well given that this is a werewolf movie! The opening sequence set in sleazy downtown L.A. is unbearably tense and could fit into any psychopathic thriller!Worth a look if only once, some horror fans will be put off by the somewhat sluggish pace, but the majority of fans will be far from disappointed!",The Howling
126,smellthecult-com-1,"A werewolf, she says.",5,9 February 2010,"Highly regarded cult classic that doesn't really stand up to scrutiny. Joe 'Gremlins' Dante's stab at a werewolf movie is a confusing affair. In every regard, this should work. It's smart: smarter than your average horror movie, and that's a fact. 12 out of every 9 psychologists confirm it. The effects are great. Dated? Yes but, unless you are the kind of slack-jawed dimwit who believes that 'there wor any gud filums mayd befour ninekeen nineky free' that shouldn't be an issue as, you know, special effects were possible before the advent of CG freakin' I.There's a decent line-up of cult luminaries, including Dee 'Critters' Wallace, Patrick 'Avengers' Macnee and Robert 'Voyager' Picardo. The story is above par, too. Yet, somehow.....some....how, it doesn't hang together particularly well, and you find your mind wandering off, thinking about other things. How many olives can you fit into your mouth in one go? If Macnee were wheelchair bound, would he have still worn a bowler hat in The Avengers? All sorts of things that are nothing to do with the movie. I've already touched on them, but another mention must go to the special effects, which are truly outstanding, and acted as precursor to the Oscar winning effects from An American Werewolf in London later that same year. The effects alone elevated this by one skull rating, else this would have hit a 4 for me. I know, I know, fellow cultists, I am an unmentionable arse-sheriff, but there it is.

Soon they discover this isn't any weekend retreat but a coven of evil from which they are unlikely to escape. I have to say that Dee Wallace's acting isn't that great but the supporting cast is fairly good and they make up for it at least a little. The best part of this show is watching the transformations and special effects and of course the ending is wild and awesome one of the few horror endings that will actually surprise its viewers.

129,bayardhiler,One of the All Time Werewolf Greats,9,24 October 2014,"Anyone who's ever heard the howl of an animal in the dead of night has probably asked themselves, 'what was that?' and perhaps more importantly, is it outside my window! If this has indeed happened to you, then 1981's ""The Howling"" won't put you at ease! It all begins on the mean streets of Los Angles with local TV reporter Karen White on her way to meet a vicious serial killer named Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo) who's reached out to her. After a terrifying encounter with Eddie in a darkened room and a police shoot, you can probably see why Karen's a little strung out. So on the advice of renowned psychologist Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee) she and her husband, Bill(Christopher Stone) head up to a secluded, counseling sanctuary known as ""the colony"". All seems well at first; the people are friendly if not slightly odd to some degree but still friendly enough. But just when she's settling in for the night that's when the howling begins. Soon enough, we discover that the colony is actually a place for werewolves to get away from the civilized world and these aren't your Lon Chaney type wolves that have to wait for the moon to be full. They are the primal beasts within all of us, waiting to be unleashed onto the world. Will Karen and Bill make it out or are they destined to be victims of the howling?Directed by Joe Dante (""Gremlins"", ""Pirana"") ""The Howling"" came out at a time when werewolf films were all but dead. There hadn't really been any real hits like 1941's ""The Wolf Man"" in decades and most studio heads considered the werewolf premise corny and outdated. Needless to say, ""The Howling"" forever destroyed that idea. Based off of the novel by Gary Brandner, the story strips away all talk of the full moon belief (Which was never part of the original werewolf lore to begin with. The whole notion of the full moon was created by Curt Siodmak when he wrote the screenplay to 1941's ""The Wolf Man"") and instead presents the werewolves as simply shape shifters who have a craving for blood every now and then. This makes them more evil and powerful since there are no limitations to where and when they can transform. All of this is directed masterfully by Dante, who is able to create a spooky and foreboding atmosphere and for a second make you believe that all talk of beasts in the night may not sound so ridiculous after all. I would even go as far as to say this is his best work. The script is cleverly written to include not only horror but a few inside jokes for those who know a thing or two about werewolf flicks.And as for makeup, this isn't your grandfather's werewolf flick. For the longest time, Hollywood werewolves looked like a guy with a hairy football glued to his head (No offense to Lon Chaney and the guys at Universal). Here, the werewolves look exactly as they should; big, hairy, mean beasts from the pits of hell. Rob Bottin must be congratulated all the way for his work here, especially when it comes to Eddie's transformation sequence which has to rank as one of the best transformation sequences ever. All of the actors and actresses play their parts well, which goes a long way to making films of this type into something special. Dee Wallace proves she is by far one of the actresses when it comes to getting into character and being scared out of her mind when playing Karen. Christopher Stone should be congratulated for his role as Bill, who badly wants to help his wife but is unsure just how. Patrick Macnee of ""The Avengers"" fame is delightful to watch here as the good if not slightly unconventional doctor, as is Robert Picardo as the disturbing Eddie Quist. Rounding out the cast is the beautiful but sadly deceased Elizabeth Brooks as Marsha Quist, John Carradine, Slim Pickens, Dennis Dugan, Noble Willingham, James Murtaugh, and many more who I just don't have space for. In the end, ""The Howling"" is a everything a horror film should be: Spooky, scary, unsettling, and able to stand the test of time. This film, along with ""An American Werewolf in London"" of the same year, probably saved the werewolf genre from extinction and still is one of the all time greats of its kind. There were a bunch of sequels after this one, but none of the ones I saw could hold a candle to this one. It's a real testament to the quality of work Dante and co. did on this. So without further adieu, lock all the doors, shutter all windows, and settle in to watch a modern horror classic. P.S. Might not be a bad idea to keep some sliver at hand in case you should hear the howling outside your bedroom window!",The Howling

But mostly it carries along nicely enough. Rob Bottin is a master of course. This is still a top 3 werewolf transformation, maybe numero uno.

131,jrfranklin01,Not Bad for It's Time,6,8 December 2004,"I first watched The Howling when I was a tot and, of course, remembered it being far scarier than when I watched it again the other day. In a film like this, produced in 1981, it is important to remember that this was when costumes were the norm in creating a horror film. There wasn't any or little C.G.I. (computer-generated images). I think because of this, directors and producers and the rest of the crew had to pour more labor into the film. It was something of an art to create gripping costume effects (like the severed arm in one scene of The Howling). Today, some of you would probably laugh, but please consider the times. Back then, some of the werewolf transformations shown in this film were considered top notch (albeit ""American Werewolf in London had the crown for best werewolf transformation). As to the plot, you can see old familiars like Patrick MacNee and Dee Wallace (probably best known as the mom in E.T.). Elizabeth Brooks caught my eye (for obvious reasons, especially her nude scene in the film) and I was surprised to find that her career ended prematurely due to cancer at the age of 47. There isn't much depth to this movie. It starts out bizarrely enough with a news anchor trying to get close to a suspected killer. She goes to a porn video store and witnesses something that gives her amnesia of the incident. MacNee suggests she go to a retreat he has in the mountains to unwind. She meets a bunch of strange characters there with her husband Bill. Soon after, howling sounds are heard and the attacks begin. Pay close attention to the 80's special effects of the werewolf transformations.I had a few flashbacks of the B-type movies back then with the intense fog they put into parts of the film and the scary organ background music. Even I laughed for a minute. But ""The Howling"" is a classic for its time, despite what may seem like ""cheesiness"" by today's standards.

Like a real werewolf, the film starts human but ends as a beast. I think it's a nice, little touch. The change of story is one of the good aspects of this movie.I also enjoyed the effects. They are very good for it's time. They might look a bit cheesy or fake now, but don't take it too seriously. The end results look fine enough.

137,thelastblogontheleft,Worth it just for the transformation,8,25 November 2017,"Director Joe Dante wasn't known for much in the horror world besides his 1978 film Piranha when he dove into The Howling (based on the book of the same name by Gary Brandner, though it apparently bears only a slight resemblance to the original story) a few years later. It was one of many werewolf movies to crop up in the 80s (others include An American Werewolf in London, Teen Wolf, and The Company of Wolves) and certainly one of the most iconic. Its financial success was instrumental in him being chosen by Warner Bros. to direct Gremlins just a few years later.The story centers around Karen White (Dee Wallace), a news anchor in Los Angeles who is being stalked by serial murderer Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo in his very first movie role). She works alongside the police to lure him to a porno theater where he is fatally shot after revealing his true form to her. She suffers amnesia after the encounter and her psychiatrist (Patrick Macnee) encourages her to take a leave of absence to his secluded resort in the woods — called The Colony — with her husband (Christopher Stone) so she can rest and regain her memory. While there, she realizes this group of psychiatric patients all have one thing in common, and it's not their doctor** SPOILERS! **A huge part of why I loved this movie so much was how self-aware it was — almost satirical at times. It is filled to the absolute brim with references, homages, and cameos. Roger Corman appears as a man waiting outside of a phone booth, while Forrest J. Ackerman is seen at the occult bookstore holding a copy of his own Famous Monsters of Filmland. There are endless subtle hints by fellow patients at The Colony — ""I sleep like the dead"" or ""I figure another five years of real hard work and maybe I'll be a human being""– or workers at the morgue — ""he didn't get up and walk out on his own"" — or even Karen's own husband — mentioning several times about how he tries to stay away from meat, but voraciously inhaling exactly that when their friend Terry (Belinda Balaski) comes to visit, mentioning ""I get hungry enough, I'll eat anything!"". There are several cans of Wolf brand chili spotted throughout, a copy of Allen Ginsberg's Howl and Other Poems casually laying on a desk, Bill reading ""You Can't Go Home Again"" after he's bitten, a TV playing the Looney Toons episode with the Big Bad Wolf. The list could go on, but I loved all of the little references here and there.The special effects are, understandably, one of the main things this movie is known for. Rick Baker (Squirm, Men in Black, Videodrome) was originally in charge of the monster makeup, but he actually passed to work on An American Werewolf in London (and created easily the best werewolf transformation of all time) and left his assistant, Rob Bottin, to work in his absence. Bottin already had The Fog under his belt, and rocked this job as well.He clearly learned well from Baker but had his own distinct style — Eddie Quist's transformation scene is one of the most terrifying things I've seen in a long time. The skin on his face bubbling like it was about to explode at any second, his hands stretching to impossibly thin fingers, his eyes rolling around in his head shudder. I couldn't look away. Probably the only downside to that scene, if I had to come up with one, was how calm and unaffected Karen seemed — she sticks around, looking on quite casually, for the entirety of his gruesome change before she finally retaliates. I also enjoyed Bill's transformation scene in the woods (though that was very brief), as well as the severed arm of a werewolf attacker transforming back into its human form.I think, most of all, I loved the humanity that this movie brought to the werewolves. The duality of their persona can be disappointingly understated at times, but this film brought to light how conflicted some of them may be. Clearly some of the werewolves have a desire to get back to the ways of the past — ""you can't tame what's meant to be wild, Doc — it ain't natural"" — but some, maybe most of all Dr. Waggner himself, want to find a way to keep their urges contained. Him blurting out ""thank God"" as he's shot with a silver bullet was subtle but so meaningful.The greatest example of this was the ending itself. Karen, knowing she was bit and doomed to a life that she was so disgusted by, still wants to do the only thing in her power to try to warn others so they don't fall prey to the same beasts. Her willingly transforming ON LIVE TELEVISION as a single tear rolls down her cheek (and then being shot dead as families at home and drunks in bars watched, wide-eyed) was just the coolest damn thing and all of the viewers barely batting an eye, chalking it up to advanced special effects, is as relevant today as ever.Absolutely one of the greats, both for werewolf movies and horror in general.",The Howling
138,Mulliga,Dante's tribute to the werewolf movie - A worthy companion to American Werewolf in London (spoilers),7,2 November 2003,"Joe Dante, most famous for the creature feature ""Gremlins,"" is obviously a big-time werewolf fan. ""The Howling"" is littered with references to werewolf movies and werewolf movie actors (Lon Chaney Jr., anyone?), in addition to being a good werewolf movie in its own right.The makeup effects displayed here are roughly equal to Rick Baker's famous work on ""American Werewolf in London"" (Baker was a special effects makeup consultant on ""The Howling""). We get another real-time transformation from man to beast, and it looks pretty good, even by today's standards.The story is a bit dodgy, and slightly off-pace with too many lingering shots of the woods outside the Colony. The acting is mostly crisp, with standout performances by Karen White and a young Robert Picardo (yes, THAT Robert Picardo of Star Trek Voyager fame). ""Bright Boy"" himself, Dennis Dugan, isn't bad either.When put to a direct comparison, I'd say ""American Werewolf"" edges out ""The Howling"" by a tad.

139,unakaczynski,One of the best werewolf movies ever made.,8,14 November 2005,"The HowlingEasily one of the most historically popular werewolf films out there deserves some attention, right? Well of course. And since lately I'm getting more and more into werewolf films, I figured it was high time I actually bought this one and reviewed it. This, along with American Werewolf in London, were the two films that revolutionized werewolf movies and transformed them from just some guy running around bein' all hairy and strangling people. On top of it all, we have Joe Dante (Piranha, Gremlins) directing. Good times will be had by all!This film revolves around a news anchor-woman who is helping the police track down a serial killer, made all the easier by the fact that he's taken an interest in her. Well, everything goes just awful and she ends up traumatized. Her shrink suggests she and her husband take a comfortable, soothing vacation in a community that he's a major part of. Of course, the movie is helped along by the fact that the town just happens to be chock full of werewolves who can't seem to decide whether to eat these new people or have them join up.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--We've got some beautiful and unique looking werewolves here. The first one we have a very clear view of, in the doctor's office, almost resembles some creature that's part wolf, part man, and part cat. It just kind of had that feel--not that it's bad, I liked it.--Interesting story, one of the better ones in the world of werewolves.--The acting is pretty good, one has to consider the fact that a lot of actors just don't take these kinds of roles seriously enough. So finding a movie like this where they do is quite nice.--Naked transforming werewolf sex scene by a campfire. Hmmm... maybe this should be the Memorable Scene....--Average amounts of violence--more a suspenseful werewolf film than a visually disturbing one. The gore, while only occasional, is really good.--Nice mystery story wrapped up in here.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--Decent music, somewhat average for these kind of movies.--Dee Wallace-Stone's acting occasionally isn't quite up to par, shall we say...--One werewolf transformation sequence is actually animated--like with cell animation and it doesn't look very good. It's brief and small, and doesn't detract from the film's overall quality.--Dee Wallace's friends in the movie really seem to adopt the notion of werewolves rather easily--I would think it would be hard to accept that idea... oh well...The Bad:--Some two-dimensional characters.--This film is in a series notorious for it's much crappier releases, but that's really about all there is that's not to like.The Ugly:--Robert Picardo (the hologram doctor from Star Trek: Voyager) plays the ultimate bad-ass werewolf--and boy, his face doesn't look good all charred with acid...Memorable Scene:--Robert Picardo's werewolf in the Doctor's office. Oh, and that werewolf transformation sex scene. That was pretty hot.Acting: 8/10 Story: 9/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character Development: 8/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 8/10 (some less than fancy stop-motion, and one bit of obvious animation) Nudity/Sexuality: 4/10 Violence/Gore: 8/10 (Average amount, but very high quality) Sets/Backgrounds: 9/10 Dialogue: 7/10 Music: 7/10 Writing: 8/10 Direction: 9/10 Cheesiness: 1/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 8/10 A horror must-see.

If you love horror and werewolves, definitely check it out. Unfortunately, there was far too much tongue-in-cheekiness for me - and absolutely no scares. More importantly, I was disappointed that Sayles' story wasn't executed better on- screen. The concept was wonderful, but it fell flat with overly long scenes in some cases and outrageously short ones in record time. Worst still, I hate lengthy werewolf transformations that has a frightened character just standing by to watch the entire (ho-hum) process before they become dinner. Silly.Rob Bottin's special effects were fantastic, though some of the ""bubbling"" was over-the-top.

141,tstudstrup,Why is this turd a classic?,1,9 February 2017,"Let me start by saying that for a movie that only last 90 minutes, nothing happens for the first 40 minutes. Some news woman helps catch and kill a serial killer. And she has nightmares about it and is send to a retreat for therapy. But the retreat is really a place were werewolves can be free. And she is send there unknowingly to be bitten and turned herself. It's that retarded.The effects are laughably bad, especially considering An American Werewolf In London came out the same year and The Thing came out the year before. Both movies with effects that still look good today, nearly 40 years later. And considering Joe Dante, who made Gremlins, just 3 years later, also made this, it's down right embarrassing.There are two very long scenes where two people are turned into werewolfs. And when they're done turning they look like people in bad Halloween werewolf costumes. It seems like those scenes are only there to show off really bad special effects makeup.In the second turning scene it takes what feels like 5 minutes for the guy to to turn and the heroine of the movie just stand there and looks at him instead of getting away while she has the chance.The acting is pretty bad and the only interesting scene is when two people have sex and then turn into werewolfes, because the woman is hot and shows her tits.SPOILER OF THE ENDING AHEAD.Eventually after being saved by a colleague, who kills all the werewolves, the news woman is bitten herself. She then transforms, on live television, to warn people about werewolfs. She looks like Catwoman with fur in her face. And then she is shot and killed by her colleague.

142,terrible2,The beast of the best when it comes to werewolves,10,4 December 2005,"In 1981, horror movies were on the verge of their greatest comeback. The 1970's gave us Alien, Jaws and the Exersist, but we had lost the creepiness of the classic ""Universal"" monster films, such as Dracula, The Mummy and (my personal fave) The Wolfman. Pop culture had come to know the werewolf as a guy that hadn't shaved in a while and grew fangs. Joe Dante had a different idea. I was a freshman in high school in 1981 and some friends and I played ""hooky"" from school and went to see The Howling. After about 10 minutes I was so scared, that I actually found myself wanting to go to math class. Dante's film is full of suggested terror, although once he shows you, he never lets up. Karen White (Dee Wallace) is a popular newscaster who has managed to catch the eye of a serial killer. She decides to help the police trap him, but unannounced to us is the fact that the killer has a secret... A very dark secret. After a terrifying encounter, Karen and her husband Bill (Christopher Stone), take a long needed vacation. A retreat colony up in woods is their destination and the townsfolk (including the late, great John Carradine) are just normal everyday people who welcome them with open arms. As the days go by, strange things begin to happen and we realize that the colony is actually a colony of... Anyway, the visuals are great and this was long before the computer generated crap that they throw at us these days. Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo) is the resident bad dude or (wolf) as you may, and has one of the most classic transformation scenes I have ever witnessed. His sister Marsha Quist (Elisabeth Brooks) is definitely the hottest werewolf I've ever seen, and the cast is rounded out by Sheriff Newfield played by the one and only (Slim Pickens). The Howling certainly revolutionized the modern werewolf which has come a long way since Lon Channey Jr wore an afro wig and a pig nose, and there's not a lot of werewolf stranglings in this one. I have seen every werewolf movie ever made (literally), and The Howling has always remained my favorite, with An American Werewolf In (London)comming in at close second. If you have never seen this classic film, I urge you to go rent it, turn off the lights and pull the blanket up tight under your chin (for faster head covering action). You won't regret it, after all werewolves were meant to be big, ferocious, violent beasts that rip their victim apart. Nuff said.",The Howling

144,Teknofobe70,A werewolf classic.,8,6 April 2005,"Director Joe Dante's infamous cult horror movie was released just a matter of months before ""An American Werewolf in London"", and both are generally regarded as being the most memorable werewolf movies ever made. But has this one aged as well as it's more well-known cousin? Well, it's certainly still original. Karen White, a news lady, is lured into a trap by a psychopath which involves her going into a sex shop, being made to watch a violent porno and then witnessing the man changing into some kind of monster. She is left emotionally-scarred by all this, in a very Hitchcock-ian way, and so a respected psychologist suggests she spend some time as his secluded retreat called ""The Colony"". As it turns out, the colony is the last place on Earth she wants to be, and both Karen and her husband becoming increasingly unnerved by it's occupants and the strange creatures that seem to stalk through the woods at night.Some have said that they actually prefer this film to ""An American Werewolf"", because it's a pure horror film as opposed to a horror-comedy, and thus they rank it as the greatest werewolf movie of all time. There are a few moments of subtle comedy here, but not as obvious as those in John Landis' own film. Also, you could argue that in some ways this is a more intelligent movie, which is really about ""the beast in all of us"", as Dr. George Waggner states at the beginning. It's a psychological thriller, and a well-structured one at that.""The Howling"" is one of Dante's best movies. It's certainly the one that got him noticed as a director, and just a few years after this he made ""Gremlins"" and became an even bigger cult horror icon. This is actually an early movie for him, which is impressive as it shows many signs of an experience and confident film-maker at the helm. The sets are fantastic, as is the lighting and the general atmosphere and pacing of the movie. The script is fairly tight and no longer than it needs to be, and the many references to werewolf movie history are subtly slided in to satisfy the film buffs. For example, there's a character named 'Jack Molina' -- a reference the average movie-goer won't get, but any werewolf movie fan is likely to. Various other characters are named similarly, but I'll let you get those yourself.The acting is for the most part pretty decent. All of the leads handle their roles well, and watch out for John Carradine in a small but memorable performance. I was especially impressed with some of the special effects on show here. The transformation sequence is at least in some ways on the same level as ""American Werewolf"", and this was released several months earlier. It may have something to do with the fact that Rick Baker briefly worked on this project before moving over to the other, and so some of the same ideas may have been used.For genre fans, this movie is pure gold. Others may find it a little cheesy or a little dull in places, but what the hell do they know? :P",The Howling

When it comes to special effects, every artist has his or her own trademark, everyone knows that Rick Baker concocts a mean looking Gorilla, as that is his speciality, and he has carried that trend through many a movie.Likewise, the same can be said for the work of Rob Bottin, another genius in his chosen field. If you never saw his name attached to movies like 'Legend' but you witnessed the many wonderful creations on show within the movie, you identify instantly that work you see with that of the artist who placed it all together.This is a horror movie, that carries all before it.

Dee Wallace plays Karen White, who is traumatized by a rapist. Her psychiatrist advises her to go to a vacation area in the woods. She brings her husband and two friends.

For once, characters who run up against werewolves don't have to go and find an old person to explain the plot to them because they actually live in a world where werewolf movies and tv shows and books etc exist.There are plenty of injokes, from casting John Carradine, Roger Corman, Forry Ackerman etc to naming most of the characters after directors or previous werewolf movies, but this is only part of the movie's appeal, instead of seemingly being the whole point as is too often the case in low-budget horror movies. The script is clever and witty, the characters behave intelligently most of the time, and it's well acted and well directed.Perhaps most importantly of all, Rob Bottin's creatures are the most impressive werewolves I've ever seen. Rick Baker's work on An American Werewolf in London was superb and equally groundbreaking, but when you finally saw the monster it didn't look like most people's idea of a cool-looking werewolf. Bottin's designs are fantastic, and the transformation scenes are as good as Baker's.Some people have commented that The Howling is a dumb movie that doesn't make sense. They've either accidentally seen one of the sequels, in which case, yeah they're all appalling, or else they weren't paying attention. Or they're on crack or something, I don't know. What I DO know is that all the good werewolf movies since can be counted on your left thumb. And there weren't a lot of good ones before it, either. I give it 10/10.",The Howling
159,epeteet,Top Notch Werewolf Flick,8,13 December 2008,This is a great Werewolf movie. The plot is basically about a news reporter chick who gets assaulted in a porno shop which causes her to black out and have weird visions. She's so tripped out by the incident that her psychiatrist sends her to a loony camp out in the boonies. Shortly after going to the camp a bunch of cool werewolf sh*t happens. That's all i'm gonna say about the plot. What i will say is that this movie has some killer special effects and gore. It's also got some really nice nudity! Major bonus! Sure it takes a long time to build up but once it does its well worth it. It also has a great atmosphere. I haven't seen the sequels yet but the first HOWLING is a great movie. The director went on to make TWILIGHT ZONE THE MOVIE and GREMLINS (two other great movies). Anyway if you dig werewolves this is a must see as well as American Werewolf In London.,The Howling

161,KnightLander,A howlin' good time,7,5 November 2005,"When I was in second and third grade, I was OBSESSED with werewolves. I loved ""The Wolf Man"" when I watched it, and when I finally saw ""An American Werewolf in London"" in fourth grade, it became one of my favorite films. There was only one werewolf movie I'd never seen: ""The Howling"".I could have watched it, mind you. But I put it off. Because although I am fascinated with the werewolf legend, it just so happens that the animal I fear the most ... is wolves. I thought ""The Howling"" looked extremely scary, so I put off watching - until this Halloween, when I received it for a gift. So, at last, I sat down and watched the last major werewolf film I needed to see.The film stars Dee Wallace as a popular Los Angeles newswoman who is involved in a near-fatal incident with a serial killer (Robert Picardo). A respected psychiatrist (Robert Macnee) sends her to a rehabilitation center called ""The Colony"", located in the Californian forest. Wallace believes there's something weird about the place as soon as she arrives - but once she begins to hear the howling, she believes there may be something deadly lurking in the forest ...The only Joe Dante films I'd seen before watching this were ""Gremlins"" and ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"", both of which I enjoyed very much. Dante directs this film with an obvious love of the genre and of the classic horror films. It really enhances the movie. The cast is good, but the only two performances which really stuck out to me were that of Patrick Macnee and particularly John Carradine. I thought it would've been nice to see Carradine's part expanded. I also thought it was good to see Dick Miller, though I couldn't place what else I'd seen him in at first.I thought that half of the time, Pino Donaggio's soundtrack was good, and the other half of the time I thought they made the film seem hokey. I loved the film's ending tune, though.The highlight of the film is indisputably the spectacular special effects by Rob Bottin. The scene where Robert Picardo transforms into a werewolf has been rivaled only by the transformation in ""An American Werewolf in London"", and ""The Howling""'s transformation may be even better. The effects really made the film for me.The film's script was nothing really original, and the movie was at times quite clichéd. But that's part of the fun of it. All in all, ""The Howling"" was not as scary as I expected it to be, but I enjoyed it very much and would gladly watch it again, if only for the special effects. Werewolf aficionados and horror movie lovers will have a howlin' good time.",The Howling

I know these 2 movies came out pretty close together and are always compared with each other but I just don't see why this is so widely praised. Sure the visual affects are pretty good for its time but the story is kinda weak and not so serious script maybe as the other film.I feel like all the high reviews are from people that watched it when it first came out and love it for nostalgia more than anything.

164,mr_waterfall,Howling 1 is the best werewolf movie ever dispite others hate on it.,10,25 March 2018,"Horror movies are very picky in hands of others. Why it makes it awesome? It has agood base, for 1. It has a news lady that is in a mission on a guy that has killed people. To meet at a booth, then ends up at a porn place. The guy is behind her durning filming nad starts changing she is so terrified. Can't remember, her at first loving man shes with is so understanding, she talks to some Doc guy to go to a little colony, everyone is pretty much nice, but has a spooky side. Vibe. Now the points. 1) The werewolves look awesome their on their hind legs, big jaws, the best looking i ever seen. NO joke. 2) Unlike other werewolf movies , you can see them changing in many times, their mouth moves out, and claws coming out, it looks like real effects on their face changing boiling looking the graphics look so real! 3) Great characters, and great story mode as in Example 1. The way the colony changes has DIck Miller in it, the best person in it comes into save day. The music is freaky, the atmosphere is freaky, just everyone has something to complain about. I love werewolv movies, but none no matter if Dog Soliders or Howling 2 was not bad, and afew others i give a ok or 2nd best on comes close to this, it has everything spooky area, spooky music the werewolves changing so realistic unlike any i ever seeen ever. The way they look their big mouth, big ears. LOng legs, Others looked way more costume some were on it yes or could tell others it looked so real good. The best even if not liked like it should be.

The last third of ""The Howling"" is pretty entertaining, though. There is a suspenseful chase, a shootout and bit of gore. But you'll have a hard time taking all of this seriously. It's just a bit too sleazy and plain. Some scenes are trash-tastic: werewolf sex, yay! The sequence where a man transforms into a werewolf is epic: The special effects are impressive and scary up to this day.The most interesting part of ""The Howling"" is its ending: It is cynical and genuinely funny.

166,AloysiusWeasley,"Trust me, there are better things to do rather than waste time watching this movie...",3,23 October 2007,"*SPOILERS!* I came here to read the reviews for The Howling before I decided to record it on AMC (to watch later, since it was on rather early). Let me tell you, this movie was DREADFUL. For starters, I'd heard great things about the story, plot, and special effects. Not so! I watched it with my Dad, and one of the first things he said was ""What, was this movie from the 70's?"". It only went downhill from there. There was a scene where the edges and wrinkles of the rubber glove was clearly visible when one of the werewolves reached through a broken wooded panel to reach the woman. There was a campfire sex scene - the initial transformations were all right, but then the camera moves back to about 20 feet away, and it is the fakest, WORST computer effects I've EVER seen! The f/x are all right by the time the woman and the remaining officer are in the jeep, trying to escape (the jeep won't start, of course), but still really nothing to write home about.On to the plot and the actual story. I'd read all about how it was so 'original' - wrong again! It begins with a blonde reporter who gets attacked by a psycho while covering a story. She talks to the police, then goes out for a rest at a getaway set up by a reasonably charming psychiatrist - needless to say, pretty much the whole town there is inhabited by werewolves. Now, let me tell you - the movie ran for two hours, but I wish I'd just started watching about 45 minutes in, because everything before that is stupefyingly boring. It can be summed up by ""Wah, wah, bimbo's scared, gets comforted by boyfriend, lets go for a vacation."" They wander around once they get there, and if you're looking for an even remotely spooky set in the wilderness, think again.The action starts pretty much when the boyfriend gets bitten (while he's wandering around in the woods at night by himself, unarmed *eyeroll*). It lasts for all of 20 seconds, and he then stumbles back to their cabin. It's now too painful to recall this horribly boring movie, but let me tell you this: there's a cabin that's supposed to be scary, but the hides hanging on the wall just makes it look like a hunter lives there, though the wind chimes made of bones were a little unsettling. Also, even though they're bone, they still jingle as though they were metal chimes. Yea. Oh, while we're on the subject of out-of-place noises, when the werewolves howl, there's also a yowling cat howl in there too. Who knows.Seriously, this movie is not even remotely scary, nor gory, if that's what you're looking for. The goriest thing I recall is when one of the women cuts off the arm of one of the werewolves with an axe, and that *may* inspire a nose-wrinkle of distaste, at best. (And no, I've never seen Saw or Hostel or any of those strictly gore/torture movies, so I'm not speaking from a severely desensitized POV). We gave up on trying to take this movie seriously about a half-hour in, and did what we do best when confronted by a movie this bad - we have our own little Mystery Science Theatre 3000 with it.Anyhow, let me just warn you once more - this movie is REALLY bad! Honestly, I gave it three stars because I enjoyed immensely the scene, props, and acting in the bookstore scene, and for the abrupt improvement of the f/x in the 'trapped in the jeep scene'. I don't know why there's such a lack of werewolf movies, but if you need a fix, let me recommend American Werewolf in Paris (or London), or Underworld.",The Howling
167,slayerholmes,"""We should never deny the beast in all of us...""",10,18 July 2007,"On the other hand, that's exactly what we ought to do as ""ever-developing"" human beings. Every one of us yearns for peace, unity, friends, love... And look how far we've got, nothing has changed except at some point we did lost our fur and fangs. Werewolves are in fact gotten ahead: they don't kill their own kind. (Well, at least it's not suggested in the movies of the genre.) Someone might think I give this sort of film too much credit and meanings, but it's affected me so much over the years that I must have at least some werewolf-blood in me...This is so much better film in every possible category than An American Werewolf In London, that it's absolutely beyond me how any horror-fan could think otherwise; while in the latter the dream sequences are also very good and the moments of carnage in the end memorable, even those pale in comparison. And what comes to humor, the acting, photography, mood, and ESPECIALLY the horror scenes... it's a clean sweep. AAWIL's worst problem still is the mishandling of werewolf-legends: full-moon is needed but silver-bullets are not. So it's like shooting a rabid dog in the end...Howling has it's tongue-in-cheek-approach in many ways of course too, but comedy never gets in the way of real horror. The jokes are directed mainly for film-buffs as inside-ones, many of them requiring several viewings to get. And those werewolves: there are hordes of them and they are COOL. Once again, compared to AAWIL: the key transformation scene (the wolf virtually bursts out of this roaring mad-killer-Eddie) truly rocks while in the other it's a joke. Nicely done but still.So how come this classic rates only 6.4 in IMDb? Well, first of all one needs brains, sense of humor and maturity to fully enjoy it, unlike the garbage in the style of The Hills Have Eyes etc. (6.8!!!!). Then I've always thought that, although this was in my knowledge kind of phenomenon in its release year, people have forgotten the movie. AAWIL has a cooler title and always had more recognizable covers, posters and so on... therefore while everyone even today seems to have at least heard about AAWIL, no-one has seen The Howling.

168,wolfbeast,One of the best early-day werewolf movies,10,6 August 2006,"From the same year as American Werewolf in London, I guess this movie caught the shadow of that blockbuster everyone knows, and is therefore not very well known. However, the special effects are great for this movie, and even though not as focused on the actual transformation, the werewolves in this movie are excellent. Even paying attention to making them digitigrade (toe-walking) and generic body shape that people never saw before (older werewolf movies always had the very human looking shape to them).The plot itself is quite rich for this type of movie, with some twists here and there. Unfortunately quite a few (too many) sequels of this movie were made that really aren't worth watching, but this (first) one is certainly one to watch.

You've been warned.If you want to convince people that werewolves exist, the best way to do that is NOT to shoot your only evidence with zero warning.

So, it was with great anticipation that I met this movie, hailed as one of the best of the genre. I was prepared to be disappointed, because Hollywood doesn't usually do werewolf movies very well, when it does them at all.But this was just terrible. Horrible, horrible pacing, stilted acting, and special effects that I suppose for the time were good, but now are absolutely laughable. Not to mention the weird attempts at humour that destroy any mood at all. Is it campy, or earnest? Everything just seemed very superficial. It was like a badly written episode of the TV show McCloud, 'McCloud Meets the Wolfman' or something.Now, it didn't have to be this way. The film that really started it all, The Wolfman, STILL holds up. And the special effects are worse, but it doesn't matter, because it creates a great atmosphere, tells a great story, and never lets up. The best take on the genre in recent years is the Ginger Snaps series, from the Canadians.

172,bdeyes81,"The Original 'Hip, Post-Modern Horror Movie'",10,4 November 2001,"When I first saw The Howling, it was via the film's original videotape incarnation (unfortunately I missed out on the theatrical run). At the time, I thought the film was bizarre and rather overrated. Of course, I was only seeing part of the film; the video was so dark and murky that I could not see what was going on most of the time. It was not until years later that I watched a  `cleaned up' cable presentation and realized what a good movie The Howling really is. Perhaps the better the image, the more enjoyable my experience, because seeing The Howling on DVD I was finally able to fully appreciate its greatness. Karen White (Dee Wallace) is a Los Angeles reporter suffering from nightmares, panic attacks, and frigidity as a result of a botched undercover mission to trap a serial killer called 'Eddie the Mangler'. Karen's psychologist, Dr. Waggner (Patrick MacNee), advises her to stay at `The Colony', a self-help village that he operates. She and her husband Bill (Christopher Stone) travel to this secluded sector in Northern California for a week long `therapeutic vacation'. Before long, though, Karen starts to sense something is very wrong in The Colony. Her nightmares are becoming more vivid, and are now incorporating images of her husband and of people staying in The Colony. She hears howling in the night, and finds a mutilated cow in the woods. Meanwhile, back in L.A., Terry (Belinda Balaski) and Chris (John Dugan), a young couple who work at Karen's TV station, investigate the death of Eddie the Mangler for a news special the station has planned. Eddie's body disappears from the morgue, and they investigate further, only to discover that he was obsessed with werewolf mythology. When a panicky Karen calls Terry to tell her that Bill was bitten by a wolf in the woods, she rushes to The Colony to offer comfort and further her investigation. At this point, I will say no more. Of course you can probably figure out where it is headed, and if not by this point in the film you will know exactly what is going on. But The Howling is a film full of twists and turns and to spoil even one of them would be an injustice to first-time viewers. I have not seen enough werewolf movies to recognize every homage paid by this film, but apparently most of the characters are named after werewolf movie directors. Additionally, an expository scene from The Wolf Man plays as Terry learns that Bill has been bitten by a wolf, and a cartoon adaptation of The Three Little Pigs is cut into a scene of a woman being cornered by a werewolf. And there are a course an endless roster of genre cameos; Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers), B-movie king Roger Corman, and Joe Dante regular Dick Miller, to name a few. Sound familiar? Sixteen years before Scream was even a reality, The Howling invented the `self-referential scary movie' sub-genre. In fact, the humor laced throughout the film is generally the most celebrated element of The Howling. It was certainly among the most influential; contemporary classics like Evil Dead, Fright Night, Return of the Living Dead, Re-Animator, and of course Scream owe a debt to the road paved by this film. The humor may be the most widely regarded facet of this film. However, in the end this is a horror movie, and a damn scary one. As much as I love the somewhat similar An American Werewolf in London, I give The Howling the edge largely because it never gets carried away with the comedic elements. Joe Dante, who at this point was best known for the cult classic Piranha, updated werewolf folklore by applying it to two of the more popular horror trends of the time: female paranoia (Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives, Suspiria) and fear of non-urban environments (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance, The Hills Have Eyes). Dante makes the most of these two thematic elements, while also cultivating a classic, spooky atmosphere rarely seen in post-Psycho horror movies. Dante also manages to tap into primal childhood fears of the dark, the woods, the fog, and The Big Bad Wolf. In fact, some of the film's most terrifying scenes make their mark because they so aptly recreate images from Little Red Riding Hood and The Three Little Pigs. Looking back, it really is shocking how ahead-of-its-time this movie was. Not only did it turn the mirror on horror films of the past and present, but it also offered a shockingly accurate, post-Network glimpse into the media. From what I have read, the novel The Howling by Gary Brandner is vastly different, particularly in this regard. Instead of being an author (as she was in the book), Karen is a reporter, and this allows Dante to explore the notion that the American public was so desensitized by 1981 that television had to resort to extreme shock tactics to maintain viewership. Yet even more innovative is the similar viewpoint that people were also too sophisticated to believe anything even if it happened right in front of them. In a time of unprecedented cynicism and complacency (not to mention being the era of `reality shows'), Dante's message is more relevant than ever.When The Howling was released, it was extremely well received by critics and became a box office hit. Dee Wallace went on to play the mother in E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial (prompting one of the funniest lines in Scream). Joe Dante went on to direct the blockbuster Gremlins. And special make-up effects man Rob Bottin went on to such films as The Thing, Total Recall, and Se7en. As the cast and crew were busy moving on with their own successes, The Howling did not get its inevitable sequel until 1985's loosely related (or so I have heard) The Howling II: Your Sister Is a Werewolf. Over the next ten years The Howling would amass a total of six sequels, many of them barely released in theaters or sent straight to video. I have intentionally avoided these films, but from what I understand they give Amityville a run for its money as the worst horror franchise of them all. In fact, The Howling IV: The Original Nightmare, is actually a remake of the first film! Normally a string of ill received follow-ups harms a film's reputation, but in this case, it may have actually strengthened it. More than two decades after its initial release, The Howling remains one of the most enduring horror films of the 80s. My Grade: A+",The Howling

I did see an American werewolf in London though. The special effects/werewolves in this are amazing. But the characters are too far away from what they were in the novel. In the book, everyone in Drago pretty well keep to themselves. In this they're all patients of Karen's psychiatrist. It isn't like that in the book. Also in the book the rapist of Karen isn't a werewolf and is arrested at the beginning. In this he is and worse yet they took the character Marsha from the book who seemed like she was related to gypsies/magic users and made her the rapist's brother. I hate that. They also changed Karen from a regular woman working in a hotel to her being a news reporter. The worse offense is getting rid of the character Inez Polk who Karen meets after she arrives in Drago that lives in the next town over. Instead she's replaced by 2 different characters who in the film Karen has known Karen for years. I will say Marsha was played by an unbelievably attractive actress but she pales in comparison to book Marsha who seemed a bit more intimidating.

The special effects are decent, and the pace is fine, and there are some nice surprises and jokes at the end. The characters were so uninteresting, though!  Dee Wallace is absolutely horrid as the female lead, and isn't given much help from the stereotypical characters that surround her.  I never felt that Wallace's character and her husband (played by Christopher Stone, her soon-to-be husband in real life if I'm not mistaken) actually cared about one another.  They simply seemed like pawns being pushed along by the simplistic script.Cliches abound in the movie as well.  Believe me, you WILL get sick of fog by the time the film has run its course- there is enough of it to fill 3 normal horror movies!  Also, the werewolves, when they finally appeared looked comical.  Like a cross between a wolf, a rabbit, and a velociraptor from Jurrassic Park (they have long ears and equally long and then legs that were not present on any wolf I have ever seen).  There is some good suspense involving the newswoman and a pursuing werewolf, but when the filmmakers have the chance to really knock your socks off with a good jolt of surprise, they chicken out.  There are several key moments that could have been scary, but were misused.All in all, American Werewolf in London, and it's sequel/remake American Werewolf in Paris are much better movies.

While the special effects and acting are above par for an early-80s horror movie, all of the novel's elements of mystery and suspense were foregone in the interest of gratuitous gore.As a fan of the era and the genre (I snuck into MANY slasher flicks in my flaming youth), I found this film about as forgettable as the equally abominable ""Mortuary"".Do yourself a favor - go to your local used book emporium and treat yourself to Gary Brandner's paperbacks instead.",The Howling
179,user-11512,The underdog v.s. An American Werewolf In London,7,8 November 2006,"To be honest I enjoyed this rivalry werewolf flick that went against the release of An American Werewolf in London. The more horror movies the better it keeps competition fierce which both heightens the level of fear soaked horror films and causes greater effort and creativity to outlast each other. Although I believe An American Werewolf in London (AWL) tops this film with better effects such as the dead haunting ghost victims of the American werewolf, this film utilizes a different and also scary plot line. The werewolf effects in this film all but equal those of AWL> The Howling introduces the idea of werewolves having bases in nature and wondering into cities during its cycle, a scary thought for anyone from the city or from the city and visiting the woods, as if they weren't already petrified of Jason voorhees now they got howling werewolves too. The one differing werewolf feature in The Howling compared to AWL is the apparent timing in which the werewolves change over, i wont ruin any secrets. If you enjoy werewolves and/or have seen An American Werewolf in London i recommend this film as a alternative and supplimental hit, after all this film spawned 5 sequels compared to only one sequel for AWL. Also the director of this film brought you both Gremlins and Pirhana, both semi-serious horror flicks that gathered underground praise, The Howling follows suite and does not disappoint.",The Howling

181,ReganH14,A really great werewolf movie,8,14 January 2019,Whilst American Werewolf in London is usually considered the best werewolf movie I do prefer The Howling only because I find myself being able to go back and watch more times. Still AAOL is still great just I like this one more.The movie tells the story of a new reporter Karen White who goes to a retreat after an attack by a serial killer who she was meeting as part of a sting operation. Once there she begins to hear howling in the night for which her husband tries to calm her. While back in LA two of Karen's friends begin to look into werewolves when they find drawings of them in the dead serial killers home. But only he isn't really dead.This was Joe Dante's third feature film as a director and this is where I think he really hit his stride with his work. The movie is a horror film but also mixes in some comedy without going over the top as well as references to old werewolf films. The movie was adapted from a book but only loosely though depending on who has read the book that may have been a good thing.One of the strengths of the movie are the performances. Dee Wallace plays the lead role well as fragile women trying to recover after a traumatic event. Christopher Stone does good as Karen's husband and both Dennis Dugan and Dante regular Belinda Balaski play there parts well as Karen's friends who being to look into the retreat that Karen is staying at. Other mentions also go out to Elisabeth Brooks and Robert Picardo who play Marsha and Eddie Quist probably the best actors who play the werewolves.Another strength of the film is the practical effects work done by Rob Bottin. The werewolf transformation is really great and while people tend to compare this to AAWIL I tend to not purely books the movie had much less money and time and with what they had it is still brilliant and holds up well unlike the CGI crap of today. Another positive is the score by Pino Donaggio which really helps the wood of the film and is one of my favorite soundtracks.Overall The Howling is a great if not underrated werewolf flick that I think spends too much time under the shadow of AAWIL which deserves more praise.,The Howling
182,TORSO!,"Colorful, inventive horror gem",10,18 October 1998,"This terrific horror-comedy holds up extremely well today, far better than almost every other genre attempt of the 1980s.  Possibly Joe Dante's most entertaining film (although many would probably argue that ""Matinee"" is the superior achievement), ""The Howling"" plays fair to both film lovers (who will appreciate John Sayles' movie reference laden screenplay,  Dante's stylish direction and John Hora's colorful, Bava-esque cinematography) and horror fans (who, while ignoring the film's overall quality and parodistic elements, will get off on the still excellent make-up effects and gore scenes).  A great cast humanizes Sayle's jokey script, with Dee Wallace and Dennis Dugan actually managing to add some emotional power to what should have been an utterly tasteless finale.  And its amazing what technical wonders Dante and his talented crew were able to accomplish on such limited resources (the film was made for well under $2 million, approximately 1/5 of the budget for John Landis' inferior, disappointingly conventional ""An American Werewolf in London,"" released at approximately the same time). ""The Howling"" is so much more than merely the best werewolf movie since the 1940s; it's a witty, inventive, deeply satisfying entertainment, ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" of the 1980s.  (NOTE:  The poorly made, in name only ""sequels"" to ""The Howling"" are aimed squarely at pure gore/horror fans, who have always loudly professed confusion regarding the satire and humor of Dante's original; for them, ""Howlings 2 - 7"" are clearly better than the first installment of the series.)",The Howling
183,theTRUTH-hurts,Classic!,8,27 February 2006,"This is one fun werewolf movie! Dee Wallace stars as Karen, a brave TV reporter who goes undercover to catch a serial killer. Traumatized by almost becoming a victim to that hairy sicko in a peep show booth, and suffering a bout of pseudo-amnesia, Karen and her husband (Christopher Stone) go to a backwoods communal living retreat run by pop psychologist George Waggner (Patrick Macnee). The patients there act even stranger than Karen had anticipated, but little does she know that the place is actually a haven for werewolves! Starting with character names (a trend that would soon wear out its welcome in the genre), this film is bursting at the seams with inside jokes horror fans will appreciate. The cast is also a horror fan's dream come true, with great contributions from Kevin McCarthy, Dick Miller, John Carradine and many more. And then there are the awesome werewolf transformation scenes designed by Rob Bottin that have brilliantly withstood the test of time. The tone here is much different than John Landis' classic An American Werewolf in London (released the same year), but both films are funny and scary in equal measure and stand individually on their own merits.On the pedestal of werewolf films, The Howling falls somewhere right below Universal Studios' outstanding 1941 chiller The Wolf Man as the best of all time.",The Howling
184,Whatt,Praise,10,2 October 2002,This werewolf movie ties with American Werewolf in London and Ginger Snaps as being the best were-beast movie ever.

185,NormAbrams,The best werewolf movie ever,10,15 February 2003,"Edges out ""The Wolfman"" (1941) (with Lon Chaney Jr. and that old Russian or Hungarian lady) as best werewolf film I've ever seen. Great scares, a good cast, a witty, often humorous script and superb makeup by Rob Bottin make this the best in a generally weak horror sub-genre.Also distinguished as having the absolute worst group of sequels ever made to a successful movie. Each one is uniformly worse than the next. In fact, as good as the original is, the Howling sequels are the polar opposite - each one is a bigger, steamier pile of doggie (or wolfie) poo than the previous. Everyone involved in those cinematic abortions should be forced to sit through them until their uncreative little heads explode. Almost as good in the werewolf genre is Jon Landis' ""An American Werewolf in London"" from the same year. Also check out ""Dog Soldiers"" (2002). They openly ripped off ""The Howling"" but at least did a fine job of it!! Well worth a rental!",The Howling
186,DjangoLeone,The Opposite of Good *spoilers*,7,5 June 2005,"I am a fan of werewolves though I really don't know why anymore. The majority of werewolf movies are really not very good. While perusing the horror aisle at my local chain rental place, I saw a copy of Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" which I had heard was pretty decent. I heard wrong. The acting is awful, especially by our heroine Dee Wallace who has probably been in more horror films than anyone else from 1972-1990. There's not even a real werewolf until more than halfway through the flick. This movie was really just an excuse to showcase makeup effects. Apparently when fighting a werewolf it is impossible to fight them while they are metamorphosing. I laughed out loud when it takes Eddie, the rapist/murderer werewolf with horrible hair, 15 minutes to become a werewolf and as soon as he's done, Dee Wallace immediately throws acid on him. Was there no opportunity to throw it before or during the change? I also wish to thank the filmmakers for subjecting us to werewolf sex in the woods. That was just peachy. It was neat to have John Carradine and Kevin McCarthy in the same movie but did it have to be this one? At the end when Patrick Mcnee gets shot and says ""Thank God"" I nearly applauded because he now was free of this waste of time. Good job John Steed. Avoid this movie unless you want a good laugh.",The Howling

This film is a masterpiece! It's transformation effects more than rival AAWIL, plus they're done by Rob Bottin who goes on to do The Thing (I know, what an amateur!)

This alongside Gremlins is Joe Dante's finest hour at the movies. Pino Donaggio's great music also gives the film an ambience that few other horrorpics have achieved. Though many others hold John Landis wolfpic as favorite, I have to disagree. Sure, the first 15 min. of that movie was masterful in setting the mood, this one keeps it throughout the entire movie.

I had never seen The Howling, but had read so much about it, so I was excited following its DVD release and watched with fervour.How upset I was, by the poor writing, the awful acting, the careless direction, the shoddy story line, and the dramatically stayed special effects.

Howling is as funny as AAWIL but latter has a reputation of being a comedy-horror.One funny trivia: TH specifically emphasize that shapeshifting occurs deliberately anytime, day or night regardless of the moon and silver bullets are a must(which is indeed a Hollywood bolony) to kill the beast whereas AAWIL focus on moon's effect and cycle to turn a man into a howling killing-machine and using silver bullets is nothing but a ""joke"".",The Howling

It's not as frightening as it is tense due to the backdrop, the location itself gets your imagination running overdrive. You could picture yourself in the woods thinking is someone or something out there watching me! The human body count is low, but, you probably won't notice because the story is so good. By the way, this movie has some great one liners, I think the best is ""See what your friend did to my hand!""",The Howling
194,dancingcancer41,awesome werewolf flick,9,15 February 2005,"This is an excellently crafted piece of work from former Roger Corman student, Joe Dante. I won't go much into the plot, but it involves a news woman who gets attacked while in a porno shop viewing room. To get her mind off things, a psychiatrist recommends she goes to his private retreat to be treated. After that, spooky happenings and strange deaths start occurring. This film has great direction and great atmosphere and mood. The lighting and use of fog is excellent and really hightens the spookiness of the film. One of the best werewolf transformations is shown in this film, rivaled only by the one in An American Werewolf in London. Although this movie starts out slow, the tension keeps rising and keeps you interested in what will happen next. The spookiness doesn't always lie within the content but also the claustrophobic feeling and the uncertainty of who you can trust. A very good movie, highly recommended.",The Howling
195,jehanzebshahzad,"Yep, worked for me",7,5 January 2020,"If you are looking for something which makes sense and is logical, then this movie is not for you because the story had many loopholes. At one point, you just start questioning the sanity of the characters because no sane person would stand and watch a dude transform into a werewolf especially when that dude is having you for his dinner. Apparently, the protagonist gives a big fat F to common sense and watches the whole thing instead of running away from a beast but then again, you expect these kinds of decisions to be made by the lead in a horror film right?
However, this film did entertain me and most of the credit goes to the makeup artists because the werewolf transformations were extremely good. You expect a good werewolf and a good tranformation scene from a werewolf movie and this film successfully meets your expectations. Also, I liked how they removed the whole ""tranformation in a full moon only"" thing because that absolutely made no sense. I mean shapeshifters are shapeshifters because they can shift into other shapes whenever they want to right?
To summarize, this film is definitely for the people who don't take the storyline seriously and just want to see a werewolf. Also, did I mention the scene where the wolves have sex?😂",The Howling

197,boechsner,No Contest,3,19 October 2003,"Well, I rented both The Howling and An American Werewolf in London, and was all set to judge for myself which is the better werewolf film of 1981.  I watched The Howling first followed by An American Werewolf in London.  I was shocked at what I found.  First of all there is absolutely so contest, An American Werewolf in London is by far the better of the two.  I could not believe how horrible The Howling was.  Frankly, I think the weakness in The Howling was first and foremost the story itself, but I also believe the direction was pretty weak as well.  It's as if they discovered a ""cool"" new way to show a werewolf transformation and then show it over and over again to the audience in a strange case of overkill.  This reminds me of the low budget horror film of 1975 called The Devil's Rain, in which they had a technique where characters actually appeared to dissolve, and showed it and re-showed it again and again, tiring the audience.  The Howling does this as well.  However, I must say that the movie is actually not bad, right up until the story shifts to ""The Colony.""  This shift for some reason created disinterest, probably because it seemed too ""Friday the 13th-ish"" in this woodsy setting, but also because there is nothing that makes the viewer give a damn about any of these characters.  An American Werewolf on the other hand is by far better.  The humor injected into that film makes it even more horrific.  The one transformation scene was sufficient, and overall, this movie scared me, The Howling bored me.  The viewer become attached to the main character in London and thus producing an even greater sense of horror in that you didn't want this to happen to him.  Also, each of the dream sequences were brilliant that led the viewer to unwilling come to the conclusion that fate was inevitable.  Bottom line:  Skip The Howling and see An American Werewolf in London.",The Howling

199,glazos,Top of the line production,10,11 September 2002,"In 1981, Joe Dante was about to come up with a twisted horror tale about people's spirits inhabiting wolves' bodies. But he made his mind up and on second thought he went for the werewolf thing thus getting quite an achievement in the sub-genre under a limited budget. Even if special-effects are slightly better in An American Werewolf in London, one cannot deny that the final product in The Howling is far better. An American Werewolf looks more like a big rabid dog, whereas the wolf-people from the Howling resemble the ancient characters from Middle Age depictions.The story is campy, yet the movie is amazing and innovative in many regards, like the F/X department with the inflatable masks to turn mouths into muzzles, before John Landis' film. Werewolves enjoy being mutants, unlike the typical tale of the man cursed to become a beast in full moon nights. It even went to the extent making these creatures transform at any time of day or night.Most of all, The Howling accomplishes its goal by creating a good suspense atmosphere in which a legend told so many times is given a surprisingly new treatment in Hollywood standards. The first movie to bring a twist to the old Lon Chaney's tale.Very worth watching, especially now that is has been released on DVD.",The Howling

Acting is great. And the plot is very very good. I watched this film about 6 years ago and i loved it (i was scared too). I watched now, and i was still excited and i loved the movie. When i saw people morphing from human to wolf and the same backwards i almost vomited because it was so realistic looking. This movie is a lot better then ""Dog Soldiers"" well the movies have lots of differences but still the wolfs are more realistic looking..

202,juniusoliver,So Under rated!! This movie is the real deal!,10,21 March 2006,"What some of the younger viewers, by that I mean the 18-24 year olds seem to forget is for early 1980's the effects and dark nature of the story was revolutionary. This movie was shot in 1979, where most of the heroines survive at the end.Unfortunately we all know that isn't the case with this movie. To give some readers some insight into the book, the author basically wanted to comment on the dark nature of human beings and our gradual desensitized outlook on pornography and violence. Mankind (in the story and in our reality) is becoming steadily and increasingly more violent, and as result more sexual. He's trying to create a link between sex and violence, although it maybe be an old notion, he's right on the money. In addition the world that he creates is totally believable. I totally got this element of the story and therefore realized it was a metaphor for the beast, or monster that lies within us all. I think Joe Dante does an excellent job of bringing the darkness of the characters to life. Remember what sets this werewolf movie apart from the others of that time, is that the main werewolves are not ashamed of their demonic nature. In fact Eddie, TC and his sister Marsha all revel in the monstrous behavior. These aren't your father's werewolves a.k.a Lon Chaney. In the Curse of the Werewolf, the Werewolf is seen as a sympathetic character similar to that of a tragic romantic hero. There is nothing tragic about these werewolves. They love who they are and aren't trying to fit in. That aspect of the film scared the pants off me when I was 10. Most of us are used to seeing werewolves as self-hating and self-loathing but Dante flipped the script and decided to make them very self-absorbed and self-accepting. I guess that was his dark satirical spin on ""getting back to nature, psycho-babble"". I hope some of the younger viewers will re-examine the under-lying themes of the movies and somehow get a better appreciation for the film.",The Howling

The only reason a gave it 4 stars instead of 2 is because of the special effects which are quite well done for their time. I totally agree with people who say the storyline is very slow. You won't be missing anything at all if you'd skip the first hour. This may seem a useless comment, but I really don't have very much to say about this movie, since it's neither awful nor something special. It's just mediocre and boring.

I had to sit and watch this as many people went on about it being one of the best Werewolf films ever created, it shines above all the others, leaves An American Werewolf in London(AAWIL) in its shadow, a masterpiece not to be missed. WELL, let's stop that right there. How anyone can put this horrendous movie in the same light as AAWIL seriously need to give their head a wobble. The film runs for 90 mins and 80 mins of that is pure waffle, endless boring chat and needless scenes of utter nonsense that leaves you totally bored. The Werewolves were mostly at the end and what happens is not worth the 80min before it. The funniest scene has to be Dee Wallace transformation into that can only be described as Bungle from the UK childrens series Rainbow it was hilarious, the affects are not too bad considering its the 80,s but still the movie is trash, it has all the hype and no payoff, AAWIL leaves this trash in the bin where it belongs, anything from Wolfen to Dog Soldiers is far better than this. No doubt that this film has become a cult movie and usually that means its bad and this is a prime example of how not to make a Werewolf movie. It's boring, bland, badly acted and over rated. As for blood and gore that's pretty much non-existent which is odd for this genre.if you love this film then well that's your choice but i couldn't find one redeeming quality for this rubbish and to think its just been released on 4K makes me laugh even more as nothing in this film warrants a 4K transfer worth looking at.

First off, their hips weren't moving during the actual sex, at all. Second, the transformation itself was done with cheap cutaways and silly grins to show off terrible faux fangs.Third, isn't transformation supposed to be PAINFUL? This movie takes quite a few liberties with traditional werewolf lore, and this does not work out well for the film. FInally, the shot showing the finished transformation is so laughable, I spat soda through my nose when I saw it- that effect looked horrid in the 1940's, when it was done on Black and White monster movies!
