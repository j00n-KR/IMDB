0,TheLittleSongbird,Disappointing,4,7 January 2012,"This was a movie I wanted to like, with its cast and great idea, and also that I loved The Sixth Sense and liked Unbreakable very much. Shyamalan has definitely done worse than this though with The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender(I'm watching The Village as we speak and presently it is difficult to judge whether I dislike it or not), but this was a disappointment. Signs does have some good values, such as a genuinely tense first fifty minutes or so, very good cinematography and score and credible turns from Joaquin Pheonix, Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin.However, what promise Signs did have is almost completely squandered around the halfway mark. Shyamalan's direction is uneven here, first it's alert and tense and then it became lazy and lethargic. The script has an uneasy mix of cheesy and maudlin, the characters generally are underdeveloped and the story either suffers in the second half from also being underdeveloped or even worse not making much sense.Although Mel Gibson has done worse performances than this I found his performance rather laboured here, doesn't help that his character doesn't engage or that some of the worst dialogue is with him.What disappointed me most about Signs was that after such a good start, it is spoilt by scenes that come across as too mawkish and over-sentimental than genuinely poignant, creaky flashbacks that severely undermine the suspense and the truly ludicrously melodramatic ending. Not to mention some glaring and even in some cases unforgivable plot holes, particularly the aliens being killed by water.All in all, disappointing. I liked the performances, visuals and especially the tense, spooky atmosphere created at the start, but it just got lazy. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Signs
1,bkoganbing,Seeing The Small Picture,8,27 November 2009,"During the course of the film Joaquin Phoenix's character remarks that the situation they're in seems like The War Of The Worlds. It certainly is, but the small picture of it.Whereas H.G. Wells wrote on the grand scale about what nations and governments were doing to fight an alien invasion, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs concerns itself with the small picture, what is happening in one tiny corner of the world, to be precise Bucks County, Pennsylvania and very specifically Mel Gibson and his family.One day farmer Gibson who used to be a minister woke up and found that his cornfield had been systematically decimated and a precise geographical pattern was laid out that could be seen from the air. He concluded it was some kind of prank which would have been the normal reaction of anyone. But when reports of the world wide similar crop defilings and then sitings of shadowy alien figures than the world is in a crisis mode.But the world is on the back-burner for Gibson. He was a clergyman but gave it up after the death of his wife who was hit by a drunk driver. He's got his own issues to deal with if he can get himself, his children Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin and brother Joaquin Phoenix through the ordeal. All this without knowing how the world in general is coping. Gibson and the family can only speculate and that's where imaginations run wild.I have to say that Mel Gibson does a thoroughly good job as an everyman caught up in a global crisis. When War Of The Words was made by George Pal in the Fifties, the leads Gene Barry and Ann Robinson were scientists who had vital information for the survival of the world. The globe is still at risk in Signs, but Mel and his family can't worry about that, just in keeping themselves alive.Signs is thinking science fiction ranking up there with the best work of Ray Bradbury and John Heinlein. It's both entertaining and engrossing, you can't ask for more from a film.",Signs
2,Leofwine_draca,Religious drama meets alien invasion,7,21 December 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most consistently interesting directors working in Hollywood today. He first came to prominence with THE SIXTH SENSE, a top-notch horror flick, and followed it with UNBREAKABLE, a top-notch science fiction flick. Although I haven't seen THE VILLAGE yet, SIGNS makes a slight change of direction for Shyamalan. Although on the face of it, this combines both horror and science fiction elements, the actual alien invasion in the film takes a firm second place to the main thrust of the story, charting Mel Gibson's lack of faith coming from the horrific death of his wife.This is a human drama through and through, very much focused on the human mind and family relationships, and what makes it so effective is the acting. Gibson is decent, as always, and the kids – especially Rory Culkin – are surprisingly good as well. Best of all, though, is Joaquin Phoenix in support; he's the best here I've ever seen him, delivering a confident, assured, very human portrayal of his character and never stepping into the limelight, instead standing back and letting the focus lie with Gibson. Films focusing on personal religion and the topic of faith tend to be somewhat preachy; they're very difficult to do successfully, but Shyamalan manages it, making this a thought-provoking, sometimes uncomfortable voyage through the human mind. It says something that he cast himself as the driver who killed Gibson's wife; the subject matter is very mature and intelligent, subtle and most definitely not in your face.Of course, this is supposed to be an alien invasion flick, so what of that? Well, all the trappings are fine (crop circles, blurry UFO footage, weird radio signals) and the script is both witty and pleasingly referential to previous genre fare. The aliens themselves are the classic Greys, popularised in the likes of THE X-FILES, and there's a wonderfully disturbing moment when one is captured on somebody's video camera. Shyamalan hides the aliens, always skirting around them, and as such he keeps the movie realistic and believable. There are some excellent suspense sequences, notably the alien-trapped-in-the-pantry shocker which is great stuff; the great news is that it gets even better for the finale, which is a new spin on the old NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD plot, as our protagonists board themselves up in their home to fend of the aliens. It's so well shot, in fact, that it manages to be scarier and more eerie than Romero's film! Compare the basement scene in this with the equivalent in Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS and you'll see how Spielberg has just lost the plot these days.However, the final denouement for the alien is very disappointing, very Hollywoodised, and I have a feeling that the climax went against Shyamalan's own personal wishes. The film would have been much better just leaving the aliens unseen and in the dark, but no, we get a cheesy heroic-style action ending, which is completely laughable, with CGI effects that just don't hold up to scrutiny. Ah well, you can't get everything, and this ending is the only thing that mars an otherwise perfectly-made movie.",Signs
3,SnoopyStyle,going so well until the last 5 minutes,6,7 September 2015,"Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives on a corn farm outside of Philadelphia with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), his kids Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). Local man Ray Reddy (M. Night Shyamalan) had caused a traffic accident that killed his wife and he stopped being a priest. He discovers a crop circle and other strange things keep occurring. Bo thinks something is wrong with the water and puts glasses of water everywhere. Then aliens invade.There is no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is a good technical director. He creates some great tension. He peppers the movie with little comedic moments. It's a great little non-explosion filled alien invasion movie. It's a tense fun little horror movie. And then the reveal happens. The movie goes into disbelief. Honestly I try to excuse it from time to time but there are no excuses. Somebody must have noticed the problem but I guess nobody was willing to challenge Shyamalan back in the day.",Signs
4,Hitchcoc,It's Almost There,8,24 March 2006,"I mostly like this movie because the terror is presented in a subtle, weighted way. We learn more about the characters than the threat. Obviously, from the beginning, Mel Gibson's character is carrying around some big guilt and big inertia. So when the threats begin, he can't get off the mark (sort of like the guy in The Patriot). As the signs begin to appear, it is up to him to regain his faith and want to move on. The horrible incident with his wife has made him move away from god. What is missing for me is the uncertainty of what the threat is. It's obvious ""what"" it is but not ""why"" it is. When the movie concludes, we are left wondering where we will go next. It reminded me a little of Hitchock's ""The Birds."" Is there more out there and who are they and what do they want? Why are they evil and why did they decide to threaten us. Still, like most of this director's movies, it is beautiful to look at and works on most levels. Gibson is back and forth with me. I never have doubted his acting ability. At times I'm not sure what he wants out of a film.",Signs
5,claudio_carvalho,The' War of the Worlds' of the Beginning of the Twentieth-First Century,7,28 July 2003,"Minor SpoilerGraham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a recently widowed farmer and ex-Father. He is grieving due to the death of his wife in an accident caused by a car driven by a neighbor. His son and daughter, and his young brother (Joaquin Phoenix) live with him. One day, they find some mysterious signs in his cornfield and along the movie they will realize that aliens are invading Earth. In 1953, the tale of H.G. Well was greatly adapted in the screen in 'The War of the Worlds'. In 1996, we have basically the same story, in 'Independence Day', using lots of special effects and a computer virus (instead of an influenza virus) to defeat the aliens. Now, M. Night Shyamalan presents us basically the same plot, replacing the virus by water, but in a different perspective: inside an isolated farmhouse, with a very few special effects (basically sound effects), showing a simple family frightened. In the end, I found it a nice Sci-Fi movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sinais"" (""Signs"")",Signs
6,classicsoncall,"""Is it possible that there are no coincidences?""",8,11 February 2019,"I didn't care for this movie when it first came out, when I saw it on the big screen. I wasn't doing IMDb reviews back then, so I revisit those films prior to fifteen years ago that I might have seen but never commented on. My initial reluctance concerned how the story line veered off from a psychological thriller into a sci-fi flick, without considering the context of 'Father' Graham Ness's (Mel Gibson) insight into his 'two groups of people', who he defined as those who looked at luck or coincidence as confirming either their own hope versus fear. People with hope view coincidence as a sign that someone is watching over them, while those with fear feel that they're out in the world alone and on their own. Graham fell into the second camp, his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) felt comfortable in the first category.The entire story in my estimation, hinged on the way Graham was scarred by the death of his wife in a senseless accident. Unable to come to grips with any logical reason for that to occur, Graham withdrew from the clerical life and gave up on his belief in a just and loving God. What director Shyamalan tries to do is close the circle on Graham's faith by indulging in 'signs', those little moments and occurrences in a person's life that seem to have no meaning in and of themselves, but when viewed in a larger context, have a way of coming together to resonate in a person's life. So we have 'see', and 'swing away', the two vital elements Graham needed to employ in order to save his son Morgan (Rory Culkin) from the deadly grasp of a vengeful alien being.Now in terms of a personal sign, I had to get a kick out of little Bo Hess (Abigail Breslin) and her fickle taste in water. There are times my (now ten year old) granddaughter will tell me she doesn't like the water she's about to drink because it 'tastes old', or because it was lying around in a glass for a while. I try to wrap my head around the idea of water tasting 'old' and I can't do it, so I'll have to take her insistence as a means of tapping into some power I'm not aware of. Someday it might come in handy for, I don't know, an alien invasion or something along those lines.",Signs
7,lee_eisenberg,"a ""sign"" that Shyamalan's work may have been deteriorating",4,18 April 2006,"""The Sixth Sense"" was great (I literally did not see that ending coming); ""Unbreakable"" was passable (I didn't predict the ending that time either); ""Signs"" was dragging at best. It might have been slightly better without all the religious stuff. And anyway, if the aliens are allergic to water, how were they able to enter our atmosphere? And if they can travel through space, why can't they open a simple door? As for Mel Gibson, I heard that ""The Passion of the Christ"" was basically an anti-Semitic screed, so that weakens Gibson's appearance in any movie. And no doubt Joaquin Phoenix is a lot prouder of ""Walk the Line"" than of this. Just why M. Night Shyamalan - who plays a larger role here than he usually does in his movies - had to do this, I'll never understand. ""Scary Movie 3"" may have been ridiculous, but at least they spoofed this movie.",Signs
8,jboothmillard,Signs,5,18 December 2006,"When I saw it in the cinema, I thought it was one of the creepiest films ever, and made me jump quite a lot, that's without the flashbacks of course. From director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, also appearing in the film as Ray Peddy) the story revolves around ex-Reverand Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) with his farm and family, his brother Merril (Joaquin Phoenix, brother of River), son Morgan (Rory Culkin, brother of Macaulay), daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin). His crops have been taken down, and from a birds-eye-view, they could see that something is making ""signs"", or crop circles. As they wonder further about this incident, they later get closer and closer to other life on the farm and in other parts of the Bucks county. Also starring Cherry Jones as Officer Paski and Patricia Kalember as Colleen Hess. The scenes in the basement were the most tense in the cinema, the flashbacks to Graham's wife's death get in the way, and the small moments of comedy fit in okay, a good science fiction thriller. Worth watching!",Signs
9,ccthemovieman-1,Lower Expectations Helped A Lot,6,20 May 2007,"I had the advantage of hearing nothing but bad things about this film before I saw it, so my expectations were low. Often times, I am pleasantly surprised after hearing all those negative remarks. I'd include this as another film ""better than I expected, ""but not good enough to watch a second time. The second half of the film, I was told, was extremely hokey but I found it okay, although I could see where people would say that. However, I just watched it as a piece of entertainment, nothing else, and appreciated the sharp photography, too. In other words, I didn't read into anything with the story which so many others have seemed to do. Mel Gibson plays Hollywood's favorite type of clergyman: the kind who has lost his faith. That is, until, the strange turn of events at the end of the movie.Hey, it's an entertaining movie, with good suspense and very little offensive material. This is the typical M. Night Shyamaian movie, which means it does a good job of hooking you into the story but doesn't always give you a satisfying ending.",Signs
10,Tweekums,A crisis of faith and an alien invasion,7,16 November 2015,Protagonist Graham Hess is a former priest who lost is faith after the death of his wife; he lives in rural Pennsylvania with his brother Merrill and children Morgan and Bo. Strange things start to happen straight away; overnight a series of giant crop circles appear in his corn field and his dog suddenly becomes violent. At first he assumes the crop circles were the work of local youths but soon the TV reports that similar patterns are appearing all over the planet. It isn't long before everybody becomes certain that they are a precursor to the appearance of aliens; the question is will they be friendly or will they have sinister intentions.While this isn't writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's best film it is still entertaining. Early on there is a good sense of mystery as we wonder what is the cause of the strange events and even when the TV reports that aliens are definitely behind them it is possible to wonder how reliable these reports will be at least to anybody looking out for Shyamalan's inevitable twist. There are plenty of other things to wonder about; why does the young girl Bo leave glasses of water around the house and do Graham's wife's enigmatic last words have any real meaning to mention just a couple. While the film isn't really scary there are plenty of tense moments as well as some pretty funny ones. The cast does a decent job and it was nice to have child characters that weren't overly precocious. Some people will have a problem with the ending but I think if it is possible to accept a plot involving invading aliens it shouldn't be impossible to accept a resolution with a religious dimension. It was interesting to see an alien invasion film from the perspective of a small family group that decides to batten down the hatches at home rather than following those involved in fighting the aliens or a family caught up in a mass exodus fleeing the aliens; this gives the film a more intimate feel as for the most part it concentrates on just four characters. Overall I'd recommend this to any fans of Shyamalan's other films.,Signs

Another paranormal entry for writer-director Shyamalan , this is an eerie and mysterious movie depicting the tale of an isolated home , confronting the surprising mystery that lies just outside its farm , as a family lives under the control of some bizarre beings , until a revelatory twist . It explores the strange implications of a 500-foot crop circle that mysteriously appears at the location . M. Night toys with religion and other thoughtful ideas , but at times , he buries them under an illogical and rather unpredictable tale . Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan got a good feel for the intriguing as well as terrifying , at times , story . Focusing here is on security , self-preservation , frightening to unknown and conservatism , as revealed in the tale of a rural location . M. Night delivers a nice filmmaking and , as usual , he shows an important scene set in a basement , such as : in this Signs (2002) : The family is in the basement when the aliens attack , the same as : The sixth Sense (1999) : Malcolm is in the basement when discovering important plot information; Unbreakable (2000): David discovers his strength in a basement ; In The Village (2004), when they are in the cellar or basement Ivy discovers that Lucius really does care for her . Similarly , Car crashes play pivotal roles in all his films : Cole reveals his gift to his mother during a traffic jam in The six sense (1999), David ""loses"" his football abilities in a car accident in The unbreakable (2000), and a sad death in a bizarre car accident in Signs (2002 ). Here Mel Gibson as Reverend Graham Hess who questions his faith and even leaves the church gives a very good acting . Main cast and support cast are pretty well , full of young and veteran players such as : Cherry Jones, Patricia Kalember , and of course , Joaquin Phoenix and M. Night Shyamalan himself . A main draw is the cast as newcomers : Rory Culkin , Abigail Breslin ; all of them put in great performances .Rousing and thrilling soundtrack by James Newton Howard who frequently works with Shyamalan for the musical score . As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Tak Fujimoto . Well written/produced and directed by Night Shyamalan . The motion picture was well made by Night M Shyamalan , writing , producing and directing , though being some claustrophobic and slow-moving . M. Night delivers his first period piece putting the entire cast through a creepy story of extraterrestrial invasion , retelling with several surprises . Competently produced by Night Shyamalan himself , many of his films involve pivotal roles with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them and with children always having family problems . Night usually puts in a scene from one of his childhood films that marks his first attempt at the same kind of movie. The Sixth Sense (1999) includes the ghost story Nightmare on Old Gulf, The unbreakable (2000) includes the action movie Millionaire, Signs (2002) includes the monster movie Pictures , and The Village includes an untitled period piece. Night Shyamalan is an expert on fantastic and Mystery films plenty of Intelligence and thought-provoking issues as proved in : ¨Signs¨ , ¨The village¨ , ¨Lady in water¨ , ¨The Incident¨ , ¨The sixth sense¨ , with exception for an extreme flop as critical as boxoffice : ¨Airbender¨. Shyalaman usually shoots in Philadelphia , this is Shyamalan favorite location . Night is an avid comic books fan , which was made in this film that along with ""Unbreakable"" , ¨Multiple¨and ""Glass"" belong to the top-notch trilogy starred by Bruce Willis , Samuel L Jackson and James McAvoy. And this ¨Signs¨that forms a trilogy of three supernatural thrillers, The sixth Sense (1999), Theunbreakable (2000), and Signs (2002), all of them grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide. Rating 7/10 notable . Well worth watching . Better than average .",Signs
12,moonspinner55,"A big commercial package, engrossing and sometimes hugely entertaining",7,17 June 2006,"A widowed ex-minister in Pennsylvania, living on a farm with his kids and his ex-ball player brother, believes the crop circles on his land (as well as the ones profiled on the news) may be indicative of something other-worldly. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan, who understands commercial movie-making these days as well as any other filmmaker, tends to get bogged down in pretensions, but where his dialogue is sometimes gummy, his characters are complicated and relatable. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are wonderfully convincing as the brothers unexpectedly caught up in the supernatural, never letting their lived-in relationship hit a false note. Shyamalan is terrific at staging a big scary moment, and any of the sequences involving Gibson and his family are enjoyable, but the more intimate, two-character scenes stall the momentum (particularly one involving Shyamalan himself as a co-star). Still, with all its faults--and a too-literal final act--""Signs"" knows how to get reactions from its audience, and it is clever and canny if not quite hair-raising. *** from ****",Signs
13,blanche-2,not your typical sci-fi thriller,8,12 November 2002,"If you went to this movie expecting a typical sci-fi thriller, you doubtless left disappointed.  If you went to this movie to see an M. Shamalayan Night film, you probably loved it, as I did.For me, the sci-fi aspects were a device to explore the lost faith of the Mel Gibson character, a man who had abandoned the ministry after a tragedy struck his family.  The film asks the questions, are we alone in the world (and he's not talking about aliens) and is there such a thing as a coincidence?  In one particularly striking scene, as he talks with his brother, Gibson's bitterness comes through.I happen to think there's a place for spirituality in film and I love Night's take on it.  I also like his old-fashioned type of film-making, the way he pays hommage to the greats and the way he surprises us.  Night believes we don't listen enough, and if we do, there are messages abounding for us.  I'd rather see this than a pretentious, dark, depressing film that pretends to say something.",Signs

Gibson is also a farmer. The movie gets started when extraterrestrials startle Gibson's family, by turning their Pennsylvania cornfield into ""Crop Signs"" - aka ""Crop Circles"".Soon, these ""Signs"" are popping up all over India, and the world. Presumably, the designs are signposts for motherships - it's difficult to understand what logical purpose they would serve, as an alien spacecraft would be too technically advanced to use them... maybe, then, they are merely alien pranks. Or, they could be sent from God, to help Gibson re-harvest his faith ""Signs"" borrows its basic plot from H.G. Wells' ""The War of the Worlds"" - a frequently tapped well.

15,BandSAboutMovies,Before the decline,7,8 June 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan has made some sort of a comeback after years of being a punchline, but at this point in his career, he was still doing pretty well. This is probably his most crowd-pleasing movie, the tale of a minister who has lost his faith rediscovering it in the wake of an alien invasion.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is that man, living with his former baseball player brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin) on a farm in Bucks County, PA. The death of his wife has caused him to disappear from the world, just in time for ominous crop circles to show up all over the world and right in his cornfield.In addition, animals begin to turn violent and the family is forced to kill one of their dogs when it turns violent. Then, tall dark figures begin to chase them, similar to a harrowing report of aliens showing up at a child's birthday party in Mexico City. This scene, shot by M. Night with a cam corder, rank as the best he's put on the screen.The family barricades themselves in the house, battling an alien that looks to kill them all. Who knew that the glasses of water that Bo leaves all over house would be used - along with a baseball bat - to destroy that invader? And who could guess that these aliens, who were smart enough to make it to our planet, could be defeated with water? It's a little too easy, if you ask me.That said, this movie is filled with suspense. It's one of my wife Becca's favorites because as a child, she would often leave drinks all over the house and used this movie as a defense for acting that way.",Signs

There are a couple of scenes that come close to making you *#^S your pants. Mel Gibson plays a widowed farmer and former man of the cloth. When crop circles show up in his corn fields as well as multiple sites around the world, shattered faith is put to the test. His brother(Joaquin Phoenix) a down on his luck minor league home run champion comes to live with his recently widowed brother and two children. There is the little boy with asthma and a daughter that has a phobia concerning drinking water. Screen time for the alien visitor is not much, but down right creepy. The budget must have been spent on Gibson because the E.T. was mainly in the shadows and looking like a Halloween costume contestant. Tension is high and yes you do have to wait and wait for the suspense to flop out at you. All in all, I really liked this as compared to say... ""SPIDER-MAN"". Watch the skies!

17,hitchcockthelegend,"Now then, swing away Merill, again.",7,6 October 2012,"Signs is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin and Cherry Jones. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.Still reeling from the death of his wife, former man of the cloth Graham Hess (Gibson) lives and works on his farm with his two young children and younger brother. When the family awakes one morning to find a huge crop circle in their plantation, it is asked if it's a prank or the sign of alien contact?I don't know if M. Night Shyamalan discouraged the marketing of Signs? Where evidence very much pointed to it being an alien invasion movie for all the family to enjoy? But Signs is anything but a family alien invasion movie. The trailers were deliberately vague, there was a mystery element hanging over the picture and with the Shyamalan CV already boasting the phenomenally successful The Sixth Sense and the divisive, but very moody, Unbreakable, hopes were pitched somewhere between excited and intrigued. Gibson on board, and Phoenix as well, good selling points without a doubt. However, Signs is a grower, a film that pays better dividends on further viewings once armed with the knowledge of what sort of theme drives it on. Yet it still frustrates greatly and you can see why it proved so divisive.Shyamalan's movie is primarily about faith, the loss of such, the alien visitors are merely a component of this theme, they act as the catalyst that takes Graham to the pinnacle of his voyage of discovery. The meditations on faith and grief are subtle initially but they drive the picture forward, but then Manoj Shyamalan slips into sermonising and his picture strives for a huge ending to justify it, which unfortunately never arrives, this after having been tickled and baited by the mystery of what the aliens want, friend or foe? Questions leap out such as will the Hess family come through this latest crisis in one piece? And will this ""invasion"" marry up with the director's thematics that he is so keen for us to open our hearts to? The answers to these questions are mixed, and take further viewings to digest fully. That is if you can forgive the downright idiocy of the alien visitors in the first place?The last third has killed the film for many, which is a shame given the excellence on offer in the first hour. Shyamalan's camera is wonderfully fluid, his mise en scène is ace and he garners wonderfully low-key performances from his cast. While as much as his critics hate to acknowledge it, the director has a brilliant knack for building suspense, the ability to draw the viewer into his world, playing on our basic inquisitive nature. That he hasn't delivered on his promise, both here with the finale to the film and later in his overall directing career (though this writer personally loves The Village), is hard to argue against, but there is major talent there buried in his egocentric/confused make up. Elsewhere, James Newton Howard's score is channelling Herrmann and Fujimoto's photography is sublime, this really is a beautiful movie to look at.Definitely not a family film, and not really an alien invasion film, with it showcasing both the good and bad aspects of its director. Yet still compelling and pretty enough to warrant a second viewing me thinks. 7/10",Signs
18,Theo Robertson,"Moody , Atmospheric But Far From A Masterpiece",7,28 December 2005,"!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! There's a lot to commend M Night Shyamalan's SIGNS for . It's not often we see such a moody atmospheric thriller about an alien invasion and I will praise this movie later . However Shyamalan shots himself in the foot by the way the story is told Crop circles appear outside the home of the Hess family and after Graham Hess and his brother Merril find out that it wasn't caused by local pranksters Graham's son Morgan comes up with the answer - It was done by aliens . He knows this because he read a book on the subject . Obviously everyone else in the world has read only one book - The same one as Morgan - because as soon as crop circles appear round the world it's the leading story and can mean only one thing: The aliens are coming . And sure enough just like everyone has predicted lights appear over Planet Earth's cities which herald the start of little green men come to wipe us out If someone told you crop circles were signs on an alien invasion how would you react ? Exactly but at no point does anyone question a possible invasion because it's taken as read by all the characters in the story which starts to become ridiculous when the world's broadcasters start interrupting programmes showing the world wide phenomenon of crop circles . Let's be honest here jet liners crashing into sky scrapers is a good reason to interrupt TV shows with 24 hour news reports but people finding crop circles all over the world is not There's one other thing : Ten year old Morgan seems to be channeling the minds of Newton , Darwin and Einstien . Listen to this kid's dialogue "" Everything people have written about in science books is about to change "" and there's several more instances of this . You can't take this child seriously or believe in him as a three dimensional character Make that two things : Why would aliens invade a planet whose surface is composed of 70% water ? Isn't the human body two thirds water anyway. Oh and how does Graham's neighbour know that the aliens don't like water anyway ? Better make that three things because if the subtext is about rediscovering ones faith then why is everyone certain of an approaching invasion ? Surely for this theme to work then Graham should have been shouting from the roof tops that aliens don't exist only to be proved wrong . If he's wrong about aliens then surely he's wrong about the non existence of the lord right ? It's a great pity that Shyamalan didn't think these things through a bit further because despite not ruining the movie these things stop SIGNS becoming a masterpiece of genre cinema which it certainly had the potential to be . Even a critical viewer like myself who noticed the flaws couldn't help being terrified by the climax in the cellar where for one heart stopping moment it looked like a couple of the characters had been abducted . As for the scene Graham sees the reflection in the TV .... I certainly can't fault the good bits and I will recommend this movie even to those who don't like SF/Horror very much . Certainly it's a radical change to watch a film like this that doesn't have tens of millions spent on special effects and the film works better for it . You reading this Mr Spielberg ? Shyamalan will best be remembered for THE SIXTH SENSE , a film that I found somewhat overrated while his follow up UNBREAKABLE was a masterpiece in my opinion . SIGNS is slightly different because it doesn't have one of those shock twist endings and when you consider what a poor film THE VILLAGE is one can't help thinking that Shyamalan would be better off abandoning clever endings and concentrating on terrifying audiences and I would wonder if he could get away with directing a Hollywood version of Nigel Kneale's QUATERMASS AND THE PIT . Now that would be worth queuing at the cinema forUpdate 30 dec : Some have mentioned that the concept of predestination is very important to understanding the movie ie the plot holes aren't actually plot holes viewed this way and while this makes absolute sense in a metaphysical way it still misses out on logic",Signs
19,jotix100,Phoenix 1 Aliens 0,6,31 August 2002,"One wishes Signs to have lived to the potential it shows in the first part, where we are engrossed in what's going on, scared at times and amused by this mysterious film.M. Night Shyamalan has been very successful in his previous features. This, unfortunately, falls flat just when a very strong ending is needed. Like many other fans, I felt manipulated and let down by this movie.It's very easy to see what's going on in the Mel Gibson's character. His loss of faith, his grief for a lost wife, his fears of confronting reality and moving on with his life. Those things are deeper than what we are let to know, because on the surface it is one thing, but deep down it has nothing to do with the obvious 'signs' of the title. The fact that he's a religious figure is even more confusing. Obviously, he must be a protestant minister, what with the family and all, but there are moments that are puzzling because of this ambiguity. Had this script been brought to the screen with a lesser known director, it probably would have had a more satisfactory resolution, because the ending, with Joaquin at the bat, is very hard to swallow.Let's hope Mr. Night Shyamalan finds his way for the next time out.",Signs
20,preppy-3,Great while watching but...,7,5 August 2002,"I had a lot of unanswered questions afterwords. M. Night Shyamalan is a great visual director...there are some beautiful shots here. But with plots...Farmer Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) finds gigantic, interconnected circles in his cornfield. His brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and Graham's two children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) think there's something supernatural going on. Graham disagrees...until things start getting real scary. Also Graham keeps having nightmares about his dead wife who died in a car accident and made him give up being a pastor...SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!The film is very creepy and eerie in the first half (the first full view of the aliens made me jump and the pantry sequence!) but drops the ball in the second half. For one thing, you think it's an alien invasion story but it turns into a story about faith. The aliens are just there as a plot device!Also giving us long shots of the aliens was not a good idea--it's very clear that they're guys in rubber suits. Still, it did scare me occasionally.MORE SPOILERS!!!! But, afterwords, I had a lot of questions. Why do the aliens (who can be killed by water) attack a planet that is 3/4 water? Why do they attack in the first place (there's something about harvesting people...what does that mean?)? One alien is locked inside a pantry and can't get out???? Also how exactly are they defeated at the end (we're not told)? These are nagging questions that I couldn't shake off.And the film is quiet...way too quiet at times. And the faith story is awkwardly handled.The acting doesn't help. Gibson is blank-faced the entire time and Culkin and Breslin are terrible. Phoenix tries but the slow pace and insistence on quiet drags him down. So, it's worth seeing...if you don't think about it afterwords.",Signs
21,LeonLouisRicci,Say Cheese,1,9 December 2012,"Sentimental Claptrap that is Appalling in its attempt to Lure Audiences with the ""Alien Invasion"" Sub-Genre and traps them in some sort of Pseudo-Psychological, Emotional, Family Friendly, Manipulative Movie.There is so much Wrong here that is well, just Wrong. The Absurd Plot, yes the Water as Weapon thing (we do have some on our planet, one could observe), the lack of any Grand Scope that a Premise of this Magnitude Requires and of course the constant Lame Lamenting.Everything interesting takes place either Off Screen or on a tiny little Television, or even a Transistor Radio. There are many Pretensions such as Hiding the Threat (Val Lewton) to Enhance Suspense, and that Ridiculous Psycho-Babble about Faith, Fate, and Coincidence.The most Intelligent Dialog comes from the Children. The Adults Talk like they are Reading from a ""Dick and Jane"" book. Short Sentences with a Staccato that Lacks Emotion or Understanding. The Actors are ""placed"" Motionless in Front of the Camera like they are Posing for Polaroids. This is Film-Making at its most Self-Conscious.Finally, it uses the Real-Life Crop-Circle Mystery and Ufology as Exploitation with typical Misunderstanding and Misrepresentation. This is Shyamalan Pretending to be Spielberg while Ripping Off Hitchcock. He should be Ashamed of this Money Making Slight-of-Hand if He considers himself a Serious Director. If not, then take a bow for Insulting Your Target Audience and Laugh all the way to the Bank. At least William Castle didn't take Himself Seriously and that was His charm. M.

22,poolandrews,I actually really rather like Signs...,7,27 May 2007,"Signs is set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania where Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives on a farm with his his two young children Bo (Abigail Breslin) & Morgan (Rory Culkin) plus his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), one morning they discover elaborate crop circles in their corn fields. At first they think it's a hoax but there are newsflashes all over the TV which say these crop circles have appeared all over the world, then things turn really sinister when UFO's start appearing in the sky by these crop circles & when footage of an alien is caught on a camcorder the Hess family have to consider the possibility of an alien invasion...Written, produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also has a fairly big role in the film as Ray Reddy who ran over Mel Gibson's character's wife I actually really liked Signs. The script which takes itself pretty seriously could be described as somewhat slow at times but I thought the story was engaging & pretty intriguing which kept me hooked. I really liked all the character's here, OK maybe the kids are a touch annoying as they tend to be in films but I thought this was pretty well written with a decent balance between humour & seriousness. The alien invasion stuff is kept to a minimum & little is seen of the aliens themselves, this is a film where less is more & it retains a air of creepiness around the aliens. It's not big on action either & concentrates on the Hess family & almost totally ignores the outside world which is unusual for recent alien flicks which tend to be nothing more than showcase's for overblown CGI computer effects as in Independence Day (1996) & War of the Worlds (2005) so Signs is a nice change of pace, I mean there's nothing wrong with huge CGI special effects filled films but Signs was just a nice change.Director Shyamalan does a fine job but then he had a mega budget to help him, for those looking for another The Sixth Sense (1999) will probably be disappointed as Signs is a very different film & doesn't have such a great ending. I thought there were some creepy moments here & the restraint in the usage of CGI here helps create an ominous atmosphere & leaves something to the audiences imagination which is a novelty these days. What CGI is here is very good & the alien when eventually seen looks OK if a little unimaginative.With a whopping budget of $72,000,000 Signs obviously looks the business & has that big budget Hollywood look although that huge figure did surprise me a bit as there's not many special effects, there's only about five character's in the entire film & it takes place in the same location for the most part so 72 big ones does seem like quite a lot considering the end result. I thought the acting was pretty good throughout.Signs in my opinion is a great alien invasion flick that tells it's story in a different sort of way, I liked it a lot although I know for a fact there's a lot of hate out there for it. Personally I think it's well worth a watch.",Signs
23,Boba_Fett1138,Amazing movie!...till the last 30 minutes.,8,6 January 2004,"Don't you just hate it when an ending totally ruins a good movie? ""Signs"" unfortunately is a movie like that.The movie starts of extremely well, with original opening credits and some nice character building. The characters are extremely well portrayed by the entire cast and very realistic and likable. M. Night Shyamalan perfectly knows how to build up a nice atmosphere and tension in a very original way like he did before in his previous well known movies ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". The movie stays original till the last 30 minutes, after that the movie turns into some standard Sci-Fi movie with all the clichés you can expect. A shame because ""Signs"" could have very well been the best movie of 2002 and the ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" of the 21st century.But needless to say the movie is not a complete disaster, how could a movie with some many talent (cast as well as crew) involved be. It still has some genius moments that show the amazing talent of M. Night Shyamalan.The use of sound and light makes the movie very tense and yes also really scary at times! Next to ""Das Boot"" easily the best movie with the use of sound. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is over the top at times but a good job nevertheless! And James Newton Howard finally delivers a good score for a M. Night Shyamalan movie (never felt much for ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" score).All in all still a movie very well worth watching, with some scene's that you will never forget. It just a shame about the last 30 minutes...Let's hope we will get to see many more M. Night Shyamalan projects with endings that will do more justice to the rest of the movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Signs
24,view_and_review,It's OK to take a break Shayamalan,7,30 May 2007,"Coming on the heels of a smashing hit in ""The Sixth Sense"", and a solidly satisfying movie in ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"" really didn't live up to the excellence that so quickly has been expected of M. Night Shayamalan. Still, ""Signs"" was a pretty good movie by all accounts. The movie dealt with two different issues: the lost faith of a former clergyman and the covert attack of aliens. The alien story was very simple and traditional: there were crop circles and the aliens had oval heads with big beady black eyes. Of course it was still suspenseful when seen from the eyes of a family that is holed up in their basement fearfully awaiting their fate. Every antagonist has their weakness though and fortunately for mankind the aliens' weakness was the one thing that the earth is 75% of: water. The movie didn't offer any real twists or attempts at misdirection. It was fairly straight forward and still provided plenty of entertainment.",Signs
25,Uriah43,"Had a Good Balance of Humor, Mystery and Suspense",6,3 January 2015,"Six months after a fatal accident involving his wife ""Reverend Graham Hess"" (Mel Gibson) has lost his faith and given up his calling to become a farmer instead. His son ""Morgan"" (Rory Culkin) is asthmatic and his daughter ""Bo"" (Abigail Breslin) is convinced that there is something wrong with every glass of water offered to her. Additionally, Graham's younger brother ""Merrill"" (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with them is somewhat backward. So when their cornfield has certain symbols cut into it they all come to bizarre conclusions on what it all means. Little do they realize at the time that their worst nightmare is about to come true. At any rate rather than divulge any more of the story and risk ruining this film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie had a good balance of humor, mystery and suspense which managed to keep my interest from start to finish. Likewise while Mel Gibson performed well enough I especially liked the performance of Abigail Bresline and to a lesser extent that of Joaquin Phoenix as both were quite funny. In any case I liked this movie and rate it as slightly above average.",Signs
26,ferguson-6,It's time for your close-up Mr. Gibson,6,6 August 2002,"Greetings again from the darkness.  OK can we hold off for awhile with the ""genius"" label for M. Night Shyamalan?  Is he talented?  Definitely.  Can he put together a beautifully made film?  Definitely.  Is he the most creative story teller of our time?  Hardly.  ""The Sixth Sense"" was a very well crafted, twisted, almost mystical film.  The surprise of ""Unbreakable"" was obvious from the first half hour, but still enjoyable.  ""Signs"" brings us another well told story, only this one appears to be a rejected X-Files script - very simplistic.  A couple of nice scares thrown in for fun, but overall this one is a bit boring.  Could Mel have underplayed his character anymore?  Two awfully cute kids help cover-up the straight forward story.  I would also encourage Mr. Shayamalan to not succumb to the Clint Eastwood school of becoming the star in your own movie - it is a distraction and direction will suffer.  If you wish to act, go act in someone else's movie. It is a big jump from cameos to critical roles.  Another outstanding score from James Newton Howard - our best film scorer working today (including John Williams and the caught-in-a-rut Danny Elfman).  Mr. Shayamalan, you are obviously a movie fan who gets paid to make movies.  This is a life many of us only dream of.  We are depending upon you bring something new to the screen every time.  You are set financially - don't let that stagnate you creatively.  The next one is important.",Signs
27,morrison-dylan-fan,Signing up.,8,27 January 2019,"Seeing various discussions take place online over Glass (2019),I realised that despite seeing the superb Unbreakable (2000),I've not seen anything else by auteur M. Night Shyamalan! Sighting an ICM Sci-Fi/Fantasy Challenge the same time Glass came out,I decided to follow the signs.View on the film:Cementing themes which still remain active across his credits, co-star/writer/directing auteur M. Night Shyamalan reunites with Sixth Sense cinematographer Tak Fujimoto for an invasion on psychological Thriller. Confining the Hess family to the farmhouse for the majority of the title, Shyamalan & Fujimoto mark the alien invasion with an excellent use of sounds from hissing radios and a baby monitor,to creaks of floorboards and bangs against locked doors. Backed by regular composer James Newton Howard's slithering score, Shyamalan seeps a atmosphere of intense paranoia dripping from ultra-stylised extended long shots spanning the dark corners of the house,and icy reflections in objects of the invaders.Beginning the filming stage of production just after 9/11, the screenplay by Shyamalan expands the crisis of faith/hope from his past work into a reflection of the era, via the loss that the troubled family (a recurring theme in his credits)are pinned by leading to a fight for them to each re-find their faith, whilst fighting aliens. Although the use of water (which was a motif in Unbreakable, and would continue in Lady in the Water (2006)) in a possible nod to The Day of the Triffids hurts the intelligence the aliens were given the appearance of possessing,Shyamalan makes this flaw easy to sign off on,thanks to the corkscrew tension of the Hess's finding themselves having to fight back, in complete isolation. Reuniting for The Village (2004), Joaquin Phoenix gives a terrific turn as the worn-down Merrill in an outstanding ensemble cast, which includes Rory Culkin and (in her debut) Abigail Breslin as sharp-eyed kids who spot the warnings, and a simmering with sorrow Mel Gibson as Rev. Graham Hess, who must fight to find the faith to protect his family, by following the signs.",Signs

Night Shyamalan / Cast: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Cherry Jones, Abigail Breslin: Powerful thriller about direction. The signs themselves can be taken from the physical structure or as a sign of faith. Mel Gibson plays a former Priest who lost his faith when his wife was killed when struck by a truck. He lives with his son and daughter with his brother providing emotional support. He discovers circular patterns matted down their corn field. The media sees it as an alien invasion and Gibson claims that he has seen ominous figures that cause hostility in animals. His son possesses a baby monitor and can somehow read peculiar signals. Exhilarating, intelligent and scary using small details such as the monitor or the girl's half empty glasses of water to make big connections. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan who uses the same ominous appeal that worked in his previous masterpieces The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Excellent performances by Gibson whose grieving is interrupted by this strange event. Joaquin Phoenix as his brother provides stability and an exciting climatic standoff. Rory Culkin plays his asthmatic son, and Abigail Breslin plays his young daughter. Finally Cherry Jones plays a local cop who has seen Gibson through much tragedy and shows up periodically. Excellent shocker about faith and understanding. Score: 10 / 10",Signs

Night Shyamalan directed this understated thriller that stars Mel Gibson as Reverend Graham Hess, who has moved into a country farmhouse with his brother Merrill(played by Joaquin Phoenix), and two children Morgan(played by Rory Calhoun) and Bo(played by Abigail Breslin)after his wife was killed in a car accident, a personal loss that has made him lose his faith. One day, they notice crop circles in their field, which they initially pass off as kid vandalism, but it turns out to be a prelude to alien invasion, that will hit close to their home, and making Graham rethink his anger with God. Well-intentioned film is not as well structured as the directors' first two pictures, with some awkward writing and plot holes, yet the ending is deceptively underwhelming, for it's because of its subtlety(and the sudden realization by Graham about God's reasons) that it retains itself in viewers' memory. Despite the numerous flaws, this is still worthwhile.",Signs
30,Aaron1375,A different perspective on the alien invasion plot.,9,22 January 2003,"This movie shows an alien invasion from the perspective of not those on the front line, but an average family.  They are not trying to beat the aliens and save the day, but rather are just simply trying to survive.  I think the film works well doing it as well.  Though it is also and mainly a movie about faith which it does very well too.  Mel Gibson and Phoenix do great jobs as do the children.  There are scenes to get the heart pumping and the first time I say it I worried for the family a bit.  I enjoyed this one a lot more than ""The Sixth Sense"" (didn't see ""Unbreakable"") because it was a lot less dreary and there was a good bit of humor in it as well.  There are some parts I had trouble with however, the fact the aliens seemed to be more like zombies or something instead of lasering everyone was a bit unrealistic, but I can overlook that in the fact it is like ""Night of the Living Dead"" which I also enjoyed anyway.",Signs
31,Wuchakk,Is it really about aliens?,7,27 October 2013,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" (2002) is about a disillusioned ex-minister (Mel Gibson) who lives in the country with his son & daughter and brother (Juaquin Phoenix). The reasons for his disillusionment become clear as the story unfolds. When a mysterious crop circle is discovered in their cornfield they wonder if it's a prank or an alien invasion!Although the plot deals with a possible alien invasion, the theme is faith. There are two general views of life: (1) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And (2) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it.The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh (id) and spirit (super-ego). On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life dishes out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give-in to the former.This is the struggle Gibson's character faces in the story. He's given up on God and is stumbling in the dark; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade.Many people diss the film for an obvious plot hole regarding the alien's weakness, but Shyamalan's too talented to not realize this. It's a sign to what the film is really about (sorry; I couldn't resist).***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)It's possible that the aliens aren't really extraterrestrials but rather demons from the underworld (the dark dimension) invading the physical realm to take as many victims as they can. The idea that they are aliens is just a mass deception and, remember, the devil is the ""father of lies"".There are many clues: The spaceships are never seen, just lights in the sky (the devil's also called ""the prince of the power of the air"" in the bible). The ""aliens"" look decidedly demonic and have cloven hoofs. The ""primitive method"" of repelling the aliens is discovered in ""three cities the Middle East"" and is holy water, which is ordinarily used by Catholic & Episcopal exorcists against demonic manifestations (Shyamalan, by the way, attended Catholic & Episcopal schools). The daughter, Bo, was said to be a ""gift from God"" who is sensitive to impure (unholy) water. Her name in Old Norse means ""to live"" and she was able to discern the weapon of life needed to defeat the demonic menace. The dog and bird were clearly possessed. The crop circles are occultic symbols and possible portals to the underworld. The crop circle in the Hess cornfield resembles a pitchfork. When the disillusioned minister cries out to God that he hates him he actually displays his faith; after all, he has to believe in God in order to converse. At that precise moment his son recovers from the asthma attack and the news announcer declares that the ""aliens"" are retreating. You see, FAITH sends the enemy fleeing with their tails between their legs.Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The ""alien"" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet and the minister after the death of the latter's wife.Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The ""alien"" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet after the death of the minister's wife.Keep in mind that when the film debuted, Shyamalan was known as the king of the plot twist, yet the revelation that the aliens' weakness is water wasn't exactly a mind-blowing turn seeing as how the earth is 71% water and technologically advanced aliens who can travel the galaxy would know this. Moreover, the aliens curiously have no physical weapons and are easily trapped by a pantry door. It stands to reason that Shyamalan hid the twist in the movie. That twist is that the aliens are really demonic in nature.I'm not saying you can't view the movie as a literal extra-terrestrial invasion flick, but rather that the underlying demonic reading is a legitimate way of viewing the material because it all ties together and links to the story arc of the disillusioned ex-minister finding redemption. Also, I'm not suggesting that you have to believe in God to appreciate this movie, which is obviously not the case.BOTTOM LINE: This is a quality Shyamalan film and is about on par with ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village.""The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Eastern Pennsylvania.GRADE: B+",Signs

No bigtime special effects; UFO'S burning things, people melting, etc.  This film is done on a low budget, like the writer's other film Unbreakable.  The writer has some weak dialogs (ie the army guy) but the majority of the script is strong.  What works in this film results from the lack of special effects; not seeing the aliens, things that run around in the night, moving door knobs, noises, etc.  The locked in the basement scene made my heart race, what tension, but the ending is anti climatic after the basement scene.

33,JamesHitchcock,Corny Sci-Fi Thriller. Pun Intended.,4,17 June 2009,"So you thought that all those crop circles were made by hoaxers with too much time on their hands? Naaah, no way! They're all made by aliens! And if anyone is wondering why aliens might want to spend time making crop circles, the answer is simple. They're a sort of extraterrestrial sat-nav, designed to guide alien spaceships into safe landing sites.That, at least, is the theory put forward in ""Signs"". Most Hollywood films about alien invasions (""Independence Day"", ""War of the Worlds"") deal with their subject matter from an American perspective. I mean, who in America wants to see a film about aliens invading Russia, or China, or Paraguay? ""Signs"" is even more insular in its perspective, showing us not the effect of the alien invasion on mankind in general, or even its effect on America in general, but rather its effect on one particular family living on a farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.The Hess family weren't always farmers. The paterfamilias Graham Hess was originally a clergyman who lost his faith after his wife Colleen was killed in a traffic accident and now cares for his son Morgan and daughter Bo with the help of his younger brother Merrill, a former minor league baseball player who, although talented, never made it into the major leagues because of his reckless style of play. (Bo? I thought clergymen were supposed to name their children after saints of the Christian Church, not eighties film stars).The film tells the story of how Graham and Merrill manage to beat off the nasty green-skinned invaders. In the process Graham recovers his faith in God after Morgan's life is saved by what seems like a series of coincidences; Graham then resumes his clerical career. The title ""Signs"" refers not only to the crop circles but also to these coincidences, which Graham interprets as signs of divine providence.If anyone is wondering how to kill a hostile alien, ""Signs"" offers some sound advice. Hitting them over the head with a baseball bat is apparently a good move, but the best method is to empty a jug of water over them, water being a substance which is intensely toxic to aliens. This raises a whole series of questions which the film never answers. We are told that the aliens are short of food and have come to Earth to harvest humans to eat, but what we are never told is why they have chosen to come to a planet the greater part of which is covered in water and which contains significant amounts of water vapour in its atmosphere. Why do they intend to feast upon creatures whose flesh is mainly composed of water (and therefore presumably poisonous to them)? And what do they do when it rains? They don't even seem to carry an umbrella. The normal answer to questions like these is to say ""Ah, well, they're an alien species, so their thought processes are quite different to ours"", but this does not really serve as an explanation. It is unlikely that any species could have evolved unless its thought processes tend towards self-preservation rather than self-destruction.A more fundamental flaw than plot-holes of this nature is the fact that ""Signs"" evades some of the most fundamental questions raised by its basic premise. Although the film purports to deal with a religious topic, and its central character is a former clergyman, it never asks ""How might our view of God, and our religious beliefs, be changed by contact with intelligent alien life-forms?"" Graham recovers his faith because he believes that God intervened to save Morgan's life, but never asks himself why He did not intervene to save Colleen. (Or, for that matter, why He did not intervene to save the aliens, who are presumably also His creations, from having glasses of water chucked over them).The role of Graham was, apparently, offered to Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood, both of whom wisely turned it down. Mel Gibson, unfortunately, was not so discerning, as ""Signs"" is a very disappointing film. This was only the second of M. Night Shyamalan's films that I have seen, the first being ""The Village"", which I enjoyed a lot more. That film worked well both as a thriller and as a parable about the dangers of nostalgia for some imagined past, and Shyamalan managed the difficult feat of providing it with a twist ending which is both original and satisfying. ""Signs"", by contrast, is a corny (pun intended) sci-fi thriller masquerading as a meaningful exploration of religious and philosophical issues. Both Gibson and that talented actor Joaquin Phoenix are wasted. 4/10",Signs
34,StevePulaski,"Wooden and hollow, sort of like the door the aliens can't pass",2,26 June 2012,"M. Night Shyamalan has become the butt of every person's movie joke with his consistently preposterous films, his unusual casting, and his own name. Like every director, I believe he can make a well made, approachable film, but Signs is one of the biggest patient-testing thrillers I've come to know. It's an overwrought, frivolous exercise and a belligerent kick to the science fiction genre and those who aspire to work in the field.Shyamalan has effortlessly created one of the most unpleasant and meretricious films this side of the Earth. It begins when Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest, awakens to hear his daughter, Bo (Abigail Breslin) screaming outside in his cornfield. Graham and his brother, currently living with them, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) race outside to find Graham's son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and daughter staring blankly into a crushed area of corn, laying flat in a perfectly round circle. Their suspicion grows as rumors of extraterrestrial lifeforms have inhabited our planet and are looking to take over civilization as we know it.Graham and Merrill have been manning down the fort at home since Graham's wife was killed after being pinned to a tree by a man who had fallen asleep at the window. There is a scene where Graham and the man (played by Shyamalan himself) have an awkward discussion by the side of the road. It is an incredibly insensitive, strangely written scene, with the Shyamalan character reciting some of the worst written dialog in a scene supposed to occupy emotional importance. But that is only one of countless details the film neglects to build on or explain.The film tries to erect credible, memorable suspense by giving us close to an hour of buildup. I normally commend a film when this happens because I believe it provides the writer's talent to come forth, is one of the biggest and strongest building blocks to a great thriller, and is too often traded for things of a lesser breed. Here, the dialog is painfully slow, which leads to scenes progressing at a staggeringly incompetent pace, and every line of dialog is recited in a hushed, melodramatic sort of whisper that it becomes dreary and impotent abnormally fast.When we are finally met with the unworldly lifeforms (and trust me, they're not too exciting and their presence is kept at a minimum) we are greeted with one of the most colossal curveballs (not in a good way) and insulting miscalculations I have yet to see in a thriller. The aliens are said to have traveled light years through space and time, built ships of strong stature (which can be assumed since they can perfectly smash a healthy section of corn), and have successfully created a plan, they hope, will allow them to take over our planet. And they're allergic to water. I hate to build on this complaint, seeing as so many other people this side of the IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes forums have voiced criticisms have done so, but it truly not only strikes me as odd but incredibly unbelievable - even for a sci-fi film, where the suspension of disbelief is almost required for every film in the genre.How are the aliens supposed to survive on a planet that is two-thirds water? Where every breath you take has some moisture in it? It is also stated from Mel Gibson in one of the most laughably unbelievable lines in many a moon that the aliens ""seem to have trouble with pantry doors."" Yes. They are allergic to water and can't bypass an ordinary wooden door. Which leads me to another question; if the aliens plan to take over the Earth, you'd assume they'd need weapons, right? You can't go around the planet inconveniently landing in people's cornrows and crushing a good crop? If the aliens, presumably, have weapons on board that they could destroy the Earth with, don't you think the same weapons could be used to assist in bypassing a wooden door? It baffles me the negligence towards logic this movie partook in. Signs is a maddening affront to thriller and science-fiction films that try to create characters, atmosphere, and an original storyline, that are left to wallow in exhaust from the unexpected take off of other films of the same genre. I will say the film provides us with good cinematography, but completely disregards it so we can see more of the film's attempts at needless style and inconsistencies more noticeable than a perfect circle in your crops. I've always thought it would be virtually impossible to round up four or more capable performers in a picture and find almost nothing interesting to do with them, or even make an attempt to note their presence, but Signs has definitely proved me wrong.Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin.

Rarely does a film come along that is truly great by all means, even if flawed. M. Night Shyamalan's new Summer hit SIGNS is just that.
Mel Gibson turns in a wonderful performance as Graham Hess, an ex- priest (of what domination we never firmly grasp) who loses his faith after his wife dies. Now he lives with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) on a farm in Philadelphia with his two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). After finding crop circles in his cornfields, weird things start to happen all leading up to one of the best and most under rated cinematic conclusions I've seen in years.The acting in Signs itself makes it worthy of critical acclaim. Mel Gibson presents his best performance we've seen in years, and Joaquin Phoenix (who got an Oscar Nom for the 1999 film Gladiator) is superb as a humorous, but responsible brother to Graham. Rory Culkin - the brother of Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin - acts better than his brother ever did, especially considering the emotional scenes. Abigail Breslin lights up the screen, one scene in particular with Gibson when she asks why her father talks to her mother sometimes. Another great performance by all the actors is in one scene at dinner, in which they all have a bit of a feud. It's terrific acting at it's best.M. Night Shymalan, who directed, wrote, produced, and acted in this film is one of the best directors to emerge into the film industry in years. What separates Shymalan from the rest is that his approach at filmmaking is genuine and very original. He truly loves his job, and we can tell he obviously enjoys doing what he does for a living. You see, Signs isn't about aliens attacking Earth, what crop circles come from or their purpose, etc. or anything you'd think. Signs is about an ordinary man, who loses his faith, and then finds it again. That is what this film is about. We aren't presented with a horror film about aliens attacking, or any real action sequences involving this subject. We are presented with a man and his family, and what they would do. We don't want to see E.T, nor INDEPENDECE DAY, or such horror / sci-fi / action films like ALIEN and PREDATOR. Though most of those films are great, we've seen it before, and that's what makes Signs different from other alien films, and what makes us interested in it. SIGNS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT ALIENS. It's how a man finds his faith again IN THIS situation. Shymalan just took a subject he found interesting, popped in a family in the middle, and continued his brilliant message on screen. I must agree with the critics and audiences around the globe, Shymalan is the next Hitchcock.  He presents us scenes in which he drags out the invisible slowly, then unleashes the full picture (like the beginning field sequence, in which we are slowly presented the crop circles). Another aspect of this film, is proving Night has a knack for acting. In one scene, he delivers an emotional scene to Gibson. Shymalan and Gibson must work again together soon. I hope Night at least gets an Oscar nom for best director, Gibson for best actor, and Phoenix for supporting actor. THIS they all deserve an award for. It's a truly great film.Night also has a knack for making something normal and mundane very horrifying and scary. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazingly eery. Much like the classic Hitchcock films, the soundtrack changes the mood of the audience member in their seat.  It can spellbind them, amaze them, scare them, haunt them, or make them feel depressed. In SIGNS case, most of the film is filled with haunting and eery music, and uses this ancient film technique to it's advantage.The aliens, though some criticize of being very unrealistic, are presented perfectly, not showing them fully on screen, until when you least expect (some say naked aliens just look dumb, but hey, what about E.T?). One interesting part of the film, is in which a baby monitor accidentally picks up aliens speaking in `clicks,' which is how we suspect they communicate between each other. It provides a nice aspect of communication through the film not only with humans, but that these creatures are real and they do communicate, much like us.I will tell you, Signs does have some flaws that are spotted easily, and we wonder how a director like Night could have let these through into the film. One would wonder why Gibson's character doesn't arm himself with more of a weapon than a knife, but that is a forgivable flaw. I won't point out any more of the flaws I spotted, because it might ruin the film for you in case you don't spot them. Just let this be a warning, there are flaws. Just put them aside if and when you spot them and have fun.Unlike a lot of movies, Signs also has an excellent ending. When the credits start rolling, the message comes clear across, and you realize Shymalan delivered what he wanted to be delivered. Though it may disappoint some 6th Sense' fans because it uses a different technique overall, I enjoyed SIGNS better. All in all Signs does have some flaws, but if you put them aside you can find yourself having a very enjoyable experience at the movies. I did at least. The storytelling is superb, the setting and musical score is haunting, the acting is one of a kind, and the overall effect it accomplished on me and other audience members, proves that great sci-fi/horror/drama films can still be made right. I give SIGNS 4/5 stars-enjoy the film, don't criticize it's flaws.>",Signs

The second time I viewed the movie I picked up things I missed the first time watching - which made the film even better than watching it the first time around. Strangely, I was more thrilled and scared on the second viewing! Signs has a great cast who played their roles very believably - which is one of the things I enjoyed about this film.

39,OllieSuave-007,"A tad exciting, but acting is emotionless.",6,5 December 2013,"""Signs"" is a movie about a family living on a farm finds mysterious crop circles in their fields, which leads to the discovery of an alien invasion.This movie is a little exciting, coupling a classic alien-invasion plot (seen in many sci-fi movies) with a dramatic subplot involving Mel Gibson's character. The story behind his character plus the development of the other cast members are essential to the movie as it does not give this film a typical aliens-on-the-loose story. However, the overall dreary atmosphere and emotionless and bland acting made took away the intrigue intended for the plot. If I've found out a band of outer space aliens are planning to attack the Earth, I would imagine citizens panicking and government officials sounding the alarm. The urgency and commotion of that notion are not depicted here. I believe this is M. Night Shyamalan's style of directing; however, it doesn't click with me, at least. I would like to see a movie where the story's urgency and suspense are depicted by believable and energetic acting. This movie had the potential to be very intriguing and entertaining, but it is average at best.Grade C",Signs
40,sddavis63,An Interesting Combination of Horror Movie And Faith Journey,8,16 August 2003,"Much as he did in ""The Sixth Sense,"" producer/director/writer M. Night Shyamalan offers us an appropriately eerie story - about an alien invasion of earth and the effect that it has on the principal character Graham Hess (Mel Gibson.) Gibson plays an ex-priest (I assume Episcopalian since he was married and had children) whose faith had been destroyed when his wife was killed in a car accident. One morning, he discovers crop circles in his field. More than that, he learns on TV that crop circles have been found all over the world. It turns out that aliens use them for navigational purposes, and that they are the prelude to an invasion.The opening and closing scenes of the story are, in my view, the weakest which hurts an otherwise excellent film. I felt we jumped too quickly into the whole crop circle angle without any real development of the story and without knowing anything about any of the characters. The end left me rather cold, and although it was predictable enough there was really nothing in the story that had suggested it should happen (I noted, for instance, that in the immediately preceding scene Hess had still refused to pray even after his son was saved.) Instead, he focused on the idea that ""there are no coincidences."" He came to believe in his personal spiritual journey that everything has a reason; everything is part of a plan. Words his wife (Patricia Kalember) had spoken while she was dying (and even, then, her death) had a relevance to the trial the family was undergoing in the present. His faith was shattered by a crisis (his wife's death) and ultimately it's restored by a crisis (the alien invasion.) The spiritual journey is an important motif to this movie, as you can see.The movie is frightening enough in places, although certainly not the scariest movie I've ever seen. I didn't care for Joaquin Phoenix as Graham's brother Merrill. Something about him didn't work in that role. The kids (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) didn't really do anything for me, and there were also some inconsistencies in logic. (Potential spoiler here.) If water was so toxic to these aliens, it's a mystery to me why they would choose to conquer a planet that's covered in the stuff? Sure, they could choose to stay away from lakes and rivers and oceans, but what if it rained? That seemed strange and unexplained to me.Having mentioned those couple of negatives, though, I can say that I very much enjoyed the movie. I've had mixed reactions to Mel Gibson in the past. Some of his work I've really enjoyed; some I've thought was terrible. This one was near the top of the list as far as I'm concerned.8/10",Signs
41,cherold,Another fascinating genre reinvention from Shyamalan,8,14 July 2004,"So far, M. Night Shyamalan and done startlingly unusual takes on ghosts, superheroes, and now aliens.  This movie follows a completely different path from other movies of its genre.   The movie takes place away from the action, and one only has a vague idea of the overall picture.  Almost nothing is shown; at times the movie seems to just be teasing the audience with action that is just out of sight. The movie is full of lovely touches, and the ending is absolutely stunning, as though someone had created an elaborate domino trail that you didn't even know existed until they started falling one by one.  As with previous Shyamalan films, this is a thoughtful movie using genre conventions to create something unique.  It's probably not quite as effective overall as The Sixth Sense, although the ending is so powerful that it overshadows any weaknesses of the film as a whole.  It's far more successful than the interesting but unsatisfactory Unbreakable. Definitely worth seeing.",Signs

43,paul2001sw-1,War of the house,5,3 February 2006,"With 'The Sixth Sense', mysteriously-named director M. Night Shyalaman proved himself a master of certain kind of atmospheric tension. He tries to repeat the trick in 'Signs', with partial success. The start of the film is corny but undeniably gripping, and throughout he manages to conjure moments of real tension despite using the barest minimum of special effects. The limitations of this film lie more in its structure. Aliens are invading earth; but the film concentrates entirely on one family who hole up (for no particular reason) in their own house in the country, facing the menace on their own. The film thus has a feel of a ghost story (isolated family terrorised and haunted), and yet, at a time the whole earth is meant to be faced by destruction, the fate of this one family seems trivial when set in its wider context. One can also grow tired of Shyalaman's stock elements - the over-earnest loving families, the beautiful, supernaturally-aware children, the mysterious book that somehow contains at least some of the answers.Shyalaman certainly has a skill at making this sort of movie, but 'The Sixth Sense' also had a plot that was startling and cleverly-enough constructed to disguise its essential ridiculousness. 'Signs' manifestly does not: which is not to say that it won't make your skin creep as you watch it, and more than once.",Signs

The locked-in perspective is refreshing, with events feeling all the more real since they're experienced as we'd experience them if they were to occur, and at times the screenplay is nuanced enough that the audience is allowed to fill in the blanks, though bizarrely there are often jarringly poor lines and even worse line-readings often representing clunky and wholly unnecessary exposition. The religious themes end up coming across as heavy-handed, however, even though it is interesting to tackle the subject of faith using a science-fiction language, and the final act's revelation is simply an excuse for the many coincidences of the finale. 6/10",Signs

An then, two thirds in the film, you are due for a big surprise. It is really a turn in the subject, in the characters evolution and in the message. I am not going to reveal more but high chances are that you will either love it or hate it! Unfortunately, I fall in the hating category, and some of the scenes in the last third of the film are, in my opinion close to the ridicule.

I think it is better than Night's last movie Unbreakable. I really don't understand some of these negative reviews. They must be coming from the same people who made a movie like Scooby Doo number one at the box office.
(SPOILERS):  I really thought the scene where Mel and Joaquin go running around their house at night was really funny. The lines Mel says about ""I'm in insane"" and such where a hoot. 
I thought the best scene was when the family is in their house and they hear the sounds of their dog die off and see shadows on the porch and start hearing noises. That was so scary.
And I really liked how this was more than just an alien movie. It had a more serious message about losing your faith and gaining it back.
And sometimes less is better. I'm glad this movie didn't have a bunch of special effects that look so fake. The one flaw was showing the alien in full view at the end. What made it so scary was before we just saw a shadow or saw a quick shot of an arm or leg and it left the rest to your imagination. At the end, the alien should have just been in the shadows so you couldn't see any details about its appearance. I think that would have been better.
And although I do think it was strange how these tall, fast and probably strong aliens couldn't find a way into the basement, I'm not going to hold it against the rest of the film.  There were just to many good things, from the aluminum foil hats to the guy complaining about soft drink commercials during the news reports.(END OF SPOILERS)

52,tabuno,Doesn't Meet High Expectations,5,27 January 2019,"4 August 2002. While ""Signs"" is a good effort, it doesn't really get close to the high expectations built up by the proceeding publicity. Interestingly, ""Signs"" begins almost like an independent movie, even a David Lynch movie, with strange expressions, silent moments, disconnected and disjointed scenes and dialogue - spooky - sort of, but slow. There are a number of clever movie techniques attempted, with Mel Gibson being seen with only half a face in the light, a number of great bumps in the night moments, yet the movie didn't seem to have a rational, reasonable experience true to life feel. Moving back and forth from present to past, the ultimate connections did not prove nearly as satisfying as ""The Sixth Sense."" Actually, the director as actor proved to be one of the better parts of the movie.The police are no where to be seen later in the movie. Mel Gibson's brother seems wasted because unlike ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman, we have a less spooky confrontation because now there are more people to support each other unlike Nicole and her two children. The humor was cute and helped the movie move along, but it seemed ""only"" cute, not naturally a part of normal life that we, as the audience can identify with.The movie tried to be an individual family's confrontation with the unknown, but it was intruded upon by the outside, television world. The unknown forces didn't seem real either - unlike - ""The Blair Witch Project."" How come there was even television communication to begin with. There was too much attempted here, expectations were set too high. The focus was distracted by too many threads going on. The end result is a slow going, unreal, disconnected movie that can't overcome had moments of good movie making and experimental cinematic attempts.

53,ironhorse_iv,"This is a bad sign, M. Night Shyamalan. A really bad sign!",6,13 April 2016,"Written and directed by the India-born director M. Night Shyamalan, this religious film cloaked in horror science-fiction garb was the beginning of the end of the director success in the box office. While, this movie didn't tank, it did get a lot of mixed messages from critics. For me, this movie wasn't that entertaining. It was really bland & disappointing. The movie tells the story of an ex-minister turn farmer, Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) whom homestead might be the site of an oncoming alien invasion. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the settling of this film is indeed scary. However, along with the alien invasion plot, comes a moral journey of a man's loss of faith and the circumstances that help him regain his faith. This part of the film, really undermine the other plot, by making it, confusing and too complex for the general audience. Due to the miscommunication of these two separate stories, whenever the two parts try to mash together, it didn't work. A good example of this is the whole idea of aliens invading a planet, full of water, when they're supposedly hate water. Now, it would make a lot more sense, if these creatures were demons from hell, and they were invading a desert region? Better yet, if the film told us, that the chemicals in the water kills the aliens, not the water, but the movie doesn't give enough subtext to make it seem that way. Another is the fact that these creatures can't seem to open any doors. Wouldn't it make sense, if the film show us, that the reason why these supposedly, technologically advanced aliens can't get through the doors, is because, they are fallen angels!? After all, there is a verse in Exodus; where God told Moses to have the blood of an unblemished lamb put on the sides and tops of the door posts of all the Israelites, so the spirits will not killed their firstborns? It's would match better, than the way, Shyamalan badly wrote about it. In the end, this story makes it looks like these aliens possess traverse space, but lacks common sense and strategy when it comes to opening doors, and avoiding water. It's uneven. Even the whole idea of crops circles being first a hoax, only to find out that its real debate is questionable, at best. It still doesn't make sense, why they would do that. Unless, the aliens were too stupid, in attempting peaceful first contact, but lousiness, mess it up. Even, the human characters are somewhat idiotic. It's weird that they saw, one of the creature trying to get in the house, through the roof, earlier in the film, only for them, to forget to board it, later, when the home was getting attack by the aliens. That's bad! While the story doesn't cite itself as such, there are a large number of similarities between Signs and the ""Hopkinsville Goblins"" event in 1955. It's quite possible Shyamalan drew on it for inspiration, whether it's a true story or a hoax is largely immaterial to the movie. All, I know, is this movie has very-very-slow plot development pacing with large amount of psychological dialogue and little action. Yes, I know, this is meant to build the tension, but gee, it was hard to get through. Another thing that suck, about this movie is the acting, or in this case, the lack of acting. The creepy, bland, non-expressive reply from the children, Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin) is so clichés. Honestly, what type of children, act like that? Even, the crazy, full of emotions, Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix was flat and boring. Nobody really shines. I think, the only things that kinda shine in this film is the music by composer James Newton Howard, the sound effects, and the visuals. Shyamalan's visual style, and in particular, his use of the long take and the following aspects of his mise en scène, his use of 'reflected images' and mirroring effects, is somewhat amazing. It set up, the uncomfortable mood or unworldly environment, so well. It heighten intense moments. Overall: While Signs contains the semantics of the science fiction and horror elements film. It's more of a message film that somewhat got lost, between the phrases of writing from script to screen. I really don't recommended watching. Unless, you like want to figure out the subtext of the film, or like really bad movies. For me, I never want to see this film, again. I just swing away.",Signs

57,Movie Nuttball,Second viewing was even better!!!,10,27 September 2002,"I saw Signs again and let me tell ya, This movie is the most scariest movie I have seen in a long time.In my opinion the performance by Mel Gibson is flawless and is arguably his best film to date!Joaquin Phoenix was good and what he did during the end was very cool.In my opinion this is still one of the best films this year and is tied with Star Wars: Episode II.This is the first movie I can recall that sent shivers up and down my back!I recommend this film!Note:Didn`t M. Night Shyamalan (as Ray in Signs) act and have the same facial expressions as Hayden Christensen?",Signs
58,zkonedog,M. Night In His Prime,10,7 March 2017,"Coming off of ""The Sixth Sense"" & ""Unbreakable"", filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan was in the prime of his ""pull the wool over our eyes"" type of films. It sure shows in this gem of a film dealing with both aliens and the question of ""fate vs. coincidence"".For a basic plot summary, ""Signs"" sees Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), son Morgan (Rory Caulkin), and daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin) suddenly dealing with an alien presence, begun by a strange crop circle on the nearby property. This comes on he heels of the death of the mother of the family, so the remaining family members struggle to deal with this new test.What makes this movie so great is that, short of ""Sixth Sense"", it is the best ""trick ending"" of any M. Night film. I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it for you, but suffice it to say that your jaw will be on the floor (provided you are ""going in blind"", of course, without any prior knowledge). The ending even fits in with the context of the overall film, which is an area in which it surpasses later works such as ""The Village"" & ""Lady In The Water"".The acting is also terrific, with Gibson giving a poignant performance as the faithless former preacher. Phoenix and the children characters provide some much-needed comic relief in such a dark (and sometimes emotionally dreary) film. As usual, one of M. Night's most underrated directorial talents shines through: the ability to change the mood of a piece on a dime, perfectly blending satire with mystery/adventure without either getting stale.Overall, ""Signs"" is a wonderful movie if you are a fan of mysteries or sci-fi tales. It even has the ""human touch"" to vault it into all-time favorite status. Incredibly, after fooling us already with ""Sixth Sense"", M. Night turns around a scant few years later and turns the exact same trick. Remarkable.",Signs
59,Floated2,Great but could have been more twist effected,7,1 May 2016,"Signs sees Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, a former preacher turned farmer who wakes up one day to find that someone, or something, has carved an intricate pattern of circles and signs into his crops. Turning on the news he discovers that similar symbols are appearing across the globe, prompting fears that the end of the world could be just around the corner. Where one would go bad enough, Graham is trying to raise his two young children while coping with a crippling crisis of faith brought about by his wife's death in a car accident. Paranoia and grief make a dangerous combination, and as further unexplained happenings occur, Hess must take extreme measures to protect his family.",Signs
60,poe426,Superb cinema...,8,5 August 2002,"The tale's in the telling, we're told, and I would have to agree. SIGNS is at times as poignant and powerful as Shyamalan's previous two films- and as suspenseful. Like Hitchcock and Romero and Carpenter before him, Shyamalan never loses sight of the fact that it's the WAY you tell a story that makes it memorable (or forgettable). The plot can be by-the-numbers, the characters tried and true... but the director's APPROACH needs to be compelling- consistently (otherwise, s/he's a one-shot wonder). In this regard, Shyamalan soars: his films are superb cinema. All too often, budding filmmakers evince a promise that is never fully realized; on rare occasions, remarkable filmmakers turn every opportunity into the building blocks of a great career. Shyamalan has now carefully laid the foundation.",Signs
61,johnnyboyz,"Well worth it if you're into spooky, eerie films that cover horror and science fiction.",7,26 June 2007,"Signs is the third film from Shyamalan and the third that I've seen from him. After an impressive debut with The Sixth Sense and a horrid more recent instalment called Lady in the Water, Signs is actually somewhere in the middle in terms of overall quality. It takes some conventions from both films but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has all the slow, character driven build up revolving around a single setting (like in Lady in the Water) but it also has, at times, that eerie, uncanny feeling The Sixth Sense contained.The mystery surrounding the odd circles found outside is interesting and maintains a healthy amount of suspense and intrigue. Something a little more disturbing and unsettling, however, is a lot more closer to home. The amount of glasses of water that build up inside the house and the way in which the very young little girl claims that 'they're contaminated' or something to that effect is something very simple done in a very eerie way. It's complemented by the lighting and the way nobody in the family ever smiles or seems happy.As the film unfolds, clues are presented to us and the characters but neither of us are entirely sure of what is going on. The baby monitor is a good example. Up to this point, nobody in the world knows who's doing what or what is going on but over this family's baby monitor, there are some eerie, odd sounding noises that one member of the family actually identifies. Some other family members have other ideas and even we; the audience are allowed to make of it what we will which I thought was quite clever.Onto the characters and the children in particular: the kids seem to be too smart for their own good. Where the adults and brothers of Graham Hess (Gibson) and Merrill Hess (Phoenix) are busy suspecting rival neighbour farmers; the children are busy reading up on extra-terrestrials and solving it themselves  this is also hinted at later on in the film when Merrill is watching television (allowing people to tell him what to make of it all) whilst the children are busy predicting what the crop circles mean and what might happen next - they're often correct, as well.As Signs builds and builds, its divulge into past events that explain the undeniable feeling of depression in the house is cleverly revealed as is the tension built up for the film's climax which plays out like Night of the Living Dead or quite possibly any film from the 'Dead' trilogy. I'm not too sure how I'd react in a situation like that involving basements and extra terrestrials but I know for one thing that I'd have some sort of weapon lined up  this is tackled later on but only when the pressure is off to a certain extent and when they're out-numbering the critters.Signs is a good film on the whole, with some impressive tension built up along with good lighting, likable characters that you get a feel for and some clues thrown in at the beginning that add up very simply if thought through.",Signs
62,filipemanuelneto,A theory too well known to be a mystery.,3,22 February 2017,"This film is about a former evangelical pastor who lost his faith but who will be put to the test when his corn field is partially crushed, creating a crop circle. Directed and written by Night Shyamalan, the film quickly creates a mystery around crop circles, an well known phenomenon in the eighties and nineties, which fueled many supernatural theories. In fact, anyone who knows a little about that quickly realizes the direction of the plot, which simply explores the most publicized theory about crop circles. From this point of view, the film has no mystery and its easy to foresee the ending. Some religious notes arise in the plot, but it ends up lefting because it does not match with the sci-fi action after that. The fact that the main character is a former pastor isn't enough to bring religion here. Mel Gibson gave life to the main character but is far from being inspired. He seemed too theatrical most of the time. The rest of the cast was decent enough, but there was not much to do there.",Signs
63,leplatypus,An anti-Job for Mel (tv),4,18 January 2014,"So, if I'm right, the illness of his son, the alien invasion, all this was orchestrated to make Mel a believer again after the death of his wife! It's indeed the opposite of the biblical Job who never lost his faith facing some personal disaster. Maybe that's the reason (the sign) why the alien would choose their farm to come because it's so stupid to think otherwise! Sincerely, this is however greatly far-fetched and this movie can't reach the value of the ""X-files"" or ""War of the worlds"", albeit mixing faith and alien is indeed the right question to ask: if a God create us, what about the aliens so: did he create them also? In that perspective, the offers doesn't bring elements and its only good conclusion is to say that the believer never feels alone! Next, the alien invasion has never been so mistreated in a movie: maybe the beginning with the crop circle is good but the later capture of one alien in a attic is stupid and when we saw them, they look just bad. In addition, the directing is awful as Shamalayan just refuses to do it: he just put down the camera and the movie is about characters watching it. So, it's very static and quickly, it gives headaches.So for the one who was labeled as the next Spielberg, it was a bit too early and this movie and following prove that he hasn't the stuff.",Signs

How could these beings come here from 900 zillion lights years away and be unable to work a simple door latch? Couldn't they point a laser beam and cut the hinges? Just wondering. I actually enjoyed the film after putting off watching it for months, figuring it to be another ""Alien"", a movie I detested. I especially appreciated the finale as the ex-priest comes face to face with his lack of spiritual principles. Seems as though these downfallen zealots are nearly always Catholic.",Signs

It's treated like a worldwide problem and chaotic situation.I lost interest at the half of the running time, but then things started to make sense. The plot is complex because it mixes plenty of feelings. The whole losing the faith moment is the key in order to understand the whole movie...""Signs"" mixes visually shocking moments and deep feelings of humans.But when the last impact sequence happened, I almost cringe! It was unexpected and very eerie.

68,elshikh4,The Other Signs !,7,4 February 2010,"It is the best among M. Night Shyamalan's movies that I watched yet. It wasn't laughably fabricated like (The Village - 2004). It wasn't the real disappointing (Unbreakable - 2000). And most of all, it can be viewed for a second time to savor its high-minded concept unlike his previous, ironically more popular, (The Sixth Sense - 1999).I love it when the genre movie carries a message. So how about a spiritual message as well. (Signs) is about believing in fate, and its genius wisdom, which's beyond the human mind. But it is where the best of it is the meaning of its story, while the worst of it is the way this story was handled. Simply, the mix was uneven.The first half was outstanding on all the levels. The second half looked like a humdrum where the horror wasn't made well, the scene in the basement was dead, and the aliens seemed phony. Yet I was sadder for the dealing with the invasion matter, since I wholly saw it - as the same - before, being Shyamalan's frank and shameless rip-off from H. G. Wells (War of the Worlds). Generally, this second half was sick of laziness. That made it a bit poor and boring.Undoubtedly it is one of the most important roles that Mel Gibson had. And he was the highest element in the movie. Maybe most of the financial success ($227,965,690 gross out of $70,200,000 budget) came from the idea of Gibson's being, and for the first time, in a horror. But there weren't more super elements. Maybe some moments of the direction, the low tone pace, and the astonishing intro music by James Newton Howard; which kind of reminded me of (Psycho - 1960) intro music by Bernard Herrmann, in terms of the running time and the clever horror.Though, I still have faith in (Signs). I believe, this time, Shyamalan wrote this beautiful tale, then made the mystery around, while he concerned, in other movies, about the mystery first. It says a lot about paying more attention to the other signs. The signs of the omnipotent presence of God, and the complicated plans of fate. It is not another movie about the thrill and the horror of evil-creatures-attacking-peaceful-home; it's about that as just a calamity, which we must face and, most significantly, learn from it about higher issues. As if Shyamalan says how pathetic if we thought about signs of aliens, ghosts, superpowers.. etc, and forgot thinking about the signs of God. So this is why it will live longer, being the most valuable among Shyamalan's works and any other Hollywood nonsense.Just look at the lovely last scene. It pushed me to ask why this wasn't made while Jamie Stewart was alive. This kind of tales, concerning returning to faith, was in fashion at the old Hollywood. Here, it only wore new clothes. Thank God that the flaws didn't spoil, totally spoil, what is beneath them.",Signs
69,jamesrupert2014,An endless stream of let downs,4,7 September 2018,"Perhaps the film is intended to be some kind of metaphysical re-epiphany allegory, with the vaguely imaged aliens representing the senselessness of evil, water (as always) a purifying agent, Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) as (Christian) mankind, confused as always by the apparent bloody-minded capriciousness of an allegedly loving God, and the Hess kids, who are the first to believe and who pave the road to salvation, as the 'children who lead'. If not, then it is just a terrible alien invasion movie, full of plot holes, inconsistencies, conveniences, and inexplicable behaviours (see 'goofs' section and other reviews for details). Either way, it's not worth watching for anything but the production values, which are excellent at times, and the acting, which is competent, given the material. The third act is especially weak and don't hold your breath waiting for a clever resolution - none is forthcoming, the ending is a letdown that undermines much of the tension that the film succeeded in building.",Signs
70,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,10 December 2016,"Most of the negative criticism are based on two things, the first is that the director cast himself in a minor role and the second his how the aliens are defeated.Once more it illustrates the pathological hatred for a director that doesn't cut and past the same old stories.The haters fail to realize that a lot of the directors they praise sneak themselves into films. It's just a given. It happens all the time.And then the ending, how the aliens were defeated. Here we have Shyamalan attempting to give the audience something original, a plot twist that they haven't seen before. A reason for life to go on after the alien invasion, a way out to keep them from totally conquering the planet.And instead of praising the originality, the fact that it may even be a subtle nod to War of the World's without blatantly ripping off the book, they once more nail the director to the cross for not delivering the same old thing they see every day.Ignore all the hate.What you have is a moving story about faith, family, redemption, and...aliens.It is clever, moving, suspenseful, and funny all at the same time and, that is not something you get in every movie.It's not the typical alien invasion movie where earth is triumphant through force of arms and guerilla warfare.

Talk about totally cutting corners here - Get this! - Signs' story about a total, all-out invasion from outer space only featured one single alien, in all. It's true!Can you believe that director/writer Shyamalan actually expected the viewer to be so dumb and so unobservant as to believe that the world was being over-taken by hostile extraterrestrials when he only featured a lone invader in the story?.... Now, that's what I call idiotic and insulting! Since this film had a $72 million budget, surely Shyamalan could've included at least a small army of aliens in the action in order to make Signs' story appear to be somewhat more believable (instead of doing the expected by greedily paying himself $12 million and Mel Gibson $25 million).And, on top of that - When it was finally revealed to the viewer what it took to kill these aliens, it was more than enough to disgust any ""thinking"" person and get them to wondering whether Signs' story was, indeed, simply being made up as they went along.Told in the most dull and dry fashion imaginable, Signs' story didn't, in any way, convince this bored viewer that its director, nor its big-name stars, came even close to actually believing in their parts in this completely pedestrian production.",Signs
72,dfranzen70,Stop! Turn around! No entry!,1,6 August 2002,"On one level, Signs is about those weird crop circles that appeared in various places in the 1970s. On another level, it's about faith and how people can find their own faith severely tested.But first, the crop circles. Who made them? Aliens, or humans playing a prank? In the present, the same mysterious circles are appearing throughout the world, including on a farm outside Philadelphia. The owner of this farm is Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest who renounced his faith when his wife was struck and killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel. Graham lives on his farm with his two kids Morgan (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), and they all get along right fine until one weird morning when the kids discover that part of their corn crop has been flattened  - in a perfect circle.What could this mean? Well, it's not giving anything away to explain that the film goes the aliens-are-communicating-with-us route; but as the second layer of the film might indicate, this isn't just about humans versus aliens, it's about having faith that one can weather a storm.Older son Morgan immediately jumps on the it-must-be-aliens bandwagon, and he obtains a book on UFOs at a local bookstore. Soon, wouldn't you know it, he's got his sister and his uncle believing aliens are here, and they're up to no good. Morgan explains that the circles are the aliens' way of making a map, and in due time he and his family are wearing those dopey tin-foil hats that crazy people put on to keep aliens from reading their minds.Now, I want you to stop and reread that last part: They put on tin-foil hats so the aliens can't read their minds. Sure, I know what you're probably thinking - this movie's done in a campy, 50's sci-fi kind of way, where nothing seems terribly real, but it's still entertaining. That would have been fine, but that's not how this movie was presented. Every nuance, every step, everything in the movie is presented as deadly serious - even the stupid tin-foil-hat thing. People in the theater laughed when things seemed amusing, but the laughter was misplaced; there wasn't anything terribly humorous in the entire movie.First, let's look at the characters. Graham is a strong, stoic type, but he dearly misses his wife (her death is needlessly recreated - sure, it had a lot to do with the issue of Graham's faith, but it was still pointless) and probably isn't as good of a parent as he'd like to be. His brother Merrill is a former minor-league baseball player who's a few sandwiches short of a picnic lunch.  Much is made out of Merrill's dopiness (including a scene in which it's revealed why Merrill is not playing major league baseball), but I'm not sure why.Morgan and Bo are relatively interchangeable with other child characters. Morgan's a know-it-all, pushy and obnoxious. Oh, but we're supposed to think that has to do with his dad's lack of faith. Or am I looking too much into it? And Bo is just the sort of cutie-pie you'd expect, complete with those gosh-aren't-I-adorable facial and verbal expressions (you've no doubt seen the promos for the movie: ""There's a monster outside my bed, can I have a glass of water?).The characters are poorly developed, and they're not played very appealingly. Yes, I realize Graham is supposed to be a sort of hero with some notable flaws, and these flaws will be exploited at some point during the movie. And perhaps this is a movie about redemption, sure. But was it necessarily good writing to have Graham do bold, heroic things in one moment, and then be utterly clueless and indecisive in the next? And if so much was made of Merrill's slow-wittedness, why wasn't it capitalized on? How come he didn't figure into the overall theme of faith more than he did?And the kids! In one scene, they're scared; in another, they're almost authoritative. Both characters have less depth than an Etch-a-Sketch doodle. I kept expecting Graham to yell at them - just once - or discipline them in some way, at some point. Nope, never happened. Both actors playing the kids were a bit wooden, too - they couldn't decide whether to deliver their lines in a flat robotic monotone or to overemphasize every other syllable.The pacing was pretty inconsistent, too. There were scenes in the cornfield that were excellently done, typical of an M. Night Shymalan movie (he did The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, too); these scenes evoked real terror and suspense. But there were many scenes that just plain didn't make a whole lot of sense, at least in terms of the rest of the movie. At one point, the family goes into town; almost nothing that happens there is terribly important, and what is important should have taken just a few minutes. Not so. Those scenes dragged on and on and on.I haven't even touched on the whole aliens aspect of the plot. Yes, there are aliens, and yes you do see them. Let me introduce Mr. Shymalan to a new concept called special effects. Since you undoubtedly had a budget, perhaps you could have given us more than some dude in a wetsuit. I realize that the alien appearance was secondary to the real theme of the movie, but please - none of that aspect was even remotely believable.As in the worst movies, this film had a high quotient of ""Oh, come on!"" moments. You know, when you're watching a scene and can't help but think, ""Oh, come on!"" These are scenes that test one's credibility, much as Graham's faith was tested. There were contrivances, there were red herrings, and there were serious screenwriting missteps. I lost count at how many times I said, ""Oh, come on!"" during the movie.This must go down as the worst M. Night Shymalan movie, and it also has to be one of the worst that Gibson's done in a long time. He wasn't right for the role, and even he couldn't make much sense of an implausible plot surrounded by nonsequiturs and terrible pacing.",Signs
73,PWNYCNY,More than just a sci-fi movie.,9,23 October 2011,"This may be Mel Gibson's best movie. The movie is ostensibly a sci-fi but actually it's a drama about faith, using the sci-fi motif for dramatic effect. The movie contains a compelling plot, wonderful acting, excellent cinematography, and a powerful theme. The movie immediately engages the audience and effectively sets forth the moral issues confronting the principal character. The movie has a great cast, but Mel Gibson is definitely in center stage, with all the action revolving around his character. Although the special effects may seem subdued by contemporary standards, they actually help to enhance the drama, especially relating to the depiction of the aliens. This movie could have easily a War of the Worlds remake, but the director deftly avoids that pitfall, leaving the audience to ponder larger, more esoteric questions that deal with the nature of existence.",Signs

This is an iconic American film that is way underrated and over slandered. The writing in this is Oscar worthy and so are the performances. Gibson was perfect portraying a man battling his inner demons after the passing of his wife. This may be his all time best performance. Joaquin Phoenix is a super star. Period. When Culkin looks at him and says ""I wish you were my father,"" and Phoenix ripped that line, ""Don't you ever say that again."" Masterpiece.

76,XweAponX,Science Fiction used to make a statement about Faith,10,13 April 2015,"I saw this in the Theatre, so my first impressions were from that perspective. I always enjoy movies more when I see them big.I understand why people react to this film, but it's from misconception. Mainly, that this is a science fiction movie. It is, but it is not. I'll get to that in a bit, why the ""Science Fiction"" aspects are plausible within that genre. The more I watched it the first time I understood that this was a story about a man, a Priest even, who after a lifetime of being a pillar of Faith for his small town- the one person who everyone depended on to bolster their own Faith, has lost his own Faith.This is a Man who hates his God, for the loss of his Wife, maybe other things. He has quit his position as Leader of his local Diocese, but even in that resigned position, his 'constituents' still look up to him. This is shown in one scene as he takes his family into town and is approached to give advice. He is still called ""Father"", they still confess their sins to him.As a decent man he still gives 'fatherly' advice to whoever asks- It's as if they don't accept that he has quit his church and his God. And his Faith. But old 'habits"" die hard, he still will not curse and he still acts as an impromptu confession booth. I must address the misconception that as a Catholic Priest, he ""would not be Married"". Whoever thinks that, is living in the 1950's, Catholic Priests have been getting Married as far back as the 60's and Rome even made changes in doctrine to allow it. So it was not unbelievable that this man would be a Married Priest with a family- Of course, it is not common, but it is within reality. Actually he could be an Episcopalian Priest, but whether Catholic or Episcopalian, it's believable either way.As far as the fabric of Alien Invasion which underlies this story about Loss of Faith, Crop Circles and Abductions are referred to. What is given are the basic beliefs by Ufologists about what Crop Circles might be, and the two theories about why an Extra Terrestrial would visit Earth: Observation or Hostility. The first half of this film dissects some of those theories, and even refers to the wearing of ""Tin Foil Hats"", which I thought was a great jab at conspiracy theorists.But these Aliens are shown to have a weakness: Water. So, the question rises up as to why Aliens would invade a Water-based planet. Well, the answer is right in the movie; they are not invading but collecting.As far as the concept that this film is trying to ""preach"" some kind of specific Christian message, I don't see that. Faith is the same, regardless of religion. I'm not talking about the Christian concept of ""Faith vs Works"", that's a whole other issue. What is being reflected is basic Faith, all Faith is a working Faith, regardless of what it is applied to, even Science. Basically, you have Faith in a certain thing, and that Faith causes you to follow through in a certain way, because you have expectations based on that Faith.But what is Christian here, is the concept of ""Miracles"" in the form of ""coincidences"". When added up, if they hadn't happened that way, then something worse would have been the result.This is something I understand, I think many people do. How many times, after a string of unfortunate events, has it turned out that in the long run, they proved beneficial? For instance, you get held up in Traffic or by any other delay, and something bad had occurred at your destination? Had you been on time, it would have happened to you. The film provides its own fictional examples of this phenomenon, but regardless of the fictional aspects, things like that do happen.I don't think many people initially gleaned this from the film at first viewing, focusing more on this ""Water"" vulnerability, and of course, if these beings were intent on taking over Earth, it would have been a big mistake for them. But the fact that this is not what they were doing at all only becomes apparent if you watch the whole film through.And of course, this revelation occurs in the film as one of M Night Shyamalan's famous reversals, one that sets the whole Alien Invasion scenario as the thing of secondary importance, showing that the Reverend Graham Hess's return to Faith as the main point- An issue that had been affecting his family and interpersonal relationships. And in that light, my favorite part was when Hess confronts ""Ray Reddy"" (played by Night himself) as the man who had accidentally killed his wife, it was one of Night's best Hitchcockian ""Cameos"".I just felt that this film had more positive things to say, it did not show mass destruction and vaporization, which are blatant in films like Independence Day or War of the Worlds (Both versions). But the whole ""Invasion"" aspect was done as something Subtle, which I myself believe is how it would happen.My review has probably spoiled that for first time viewers, which is why I hope that it is read after viewing. Other than that, this film impacted me because it hits home several key aspects about Faith.It was as if the film were speaking right to me, not just me, but the people I was with, we all agreed on this. So I think anyone who has difficulty with this film may be having a Faith crisis the way Reverend Hess was at the start of the film- And generally, I've found that when we kick against an issue which is being brought up, we are having trouble with it.",Signs
77,MaxBorg89,"Silly ending aside, this is a very good sci-fi thriller",8,17 June 2008,"First came The Sixth Sense, then Unbreakable: two near perfect movies in a row. M. Night Shyamalan hasn't made a film that good since, but that does't mean his subsequent works aren't worth watching: they are flawed, but Shyamalan's talent in creating compelling characters and a creepy mood shines throughout all of them.Continuing in the direction of his previous two hits, Shyamalan tells a supernatural story where plot and characters are favored over action. Signs takes place in Pennsylvania, where the widowed farmer Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) finds crop circles just outside his house. The phenomenon keeps repeating itself night after night, prompting all kinds of speculation: Graham's brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and children (Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin) believe it's the work of God; Graham himself, who used to be a priest but lost his faith after his wife died in a car crash, on the other hand, doesn't know what to think. However, it seems like something is moving in the fields and scaring the animals, suggesting those circles might foreshadow an alien invasion.Just like he didn't deliver a straight horror movie or a traditional comic-book flick, Shyamalan tries to get beyond the conventions of sci-fi, using the alien premise as an excuse to focus on a man's spirituality and his quest for lost faith. The religious subtext may annoy science-fiction purists expecting immediate action, but if all genre films were alike, people would get bored pretty quickly, wouldn't they? Besides, isn't it a bit hypocritical to criticize Shyamalan for making a meditative alien movie and praise Steven Spielberg (one of the director's major influences) for doing something similar with E.T.?Also, spiritual message aside, the trademark suspense is consistently present, meaning that formally speaking Signs isn't that different from the average sci-fi thriller. In addition, the acting is as strong as expected from thespians working with Shyamalan: Gibson, in an unusually understated role, finds the soul of his character with relative ease, partly because his Catholic upbringing suits the film's themes, partly because he's used to playing widowers, as seen in Mad Max, Lethal Weapon and Braveheart; Phoenix is equally unpretentious, and the children manage to be sympathetic in a not too cutesy way.Granted, the famously bad-mouthed ending is very weak, even downright stupid if compared to everything that came before it. But that's just the last fifteen minutes: the rest is a classic example of a good story well told.",Signs
78,smatysia,Attempt at Hitchcockian suspense,6,18 March 2015,"Decent acting from the child actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin. M. Night Shyamalan played a small part himself, and did well. I can see why this film interested Mel Gibson, with the aspects of his character's faith journey. River Phoenix and the minor cast were all adequate. Despite plot holes, which most science-fiction films have, this film is largely Hitchcockian. Rather than concerning itself with explicit exposition, the main point, aside from the faith journey mentioned earlier, was the building of suspense, which requires things to be imagined, rather than shown. Some of this build-up was truly creepy. Overall it was okay.",Signs

80,barnabyrudge,"Alien invasion yarn told from a personal perspective, with a subtext about keeping one's faith (for those who want it).",6,29 December 2005,"There can't be many films which divide the audience more than ""Signs"". Even a cursory glance at the user comments here on the IMDb shows some people rating it highly and singing its praises, while others give it the dreaded 1-out-of-10 verdict. Similarly, many professional critics have been split over this film with Jonathan Ross stating that it left him ""terrifically let down"", while Cosmo Landesman hailed it ""a wonderful sustained slice of American Gothic"". I have a theory about why there are such polar opinions of the film. I believe that many people read the plot summary on the back of the video case, notice that the film features big stars like Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, and start expecting something along the lines of ""Independence Day"" or ""The War Of The Worlds"". But ""Signs"" is not that kind of film - it is not concerned with laser gun battles and aliens having their guts splattered all over the place, nor is it concerned with the spectacle of entire cities being decimated by gigantic alien spaceships. For that reason, many people who were hoping for explosions and destruction on a grand scale come away feeling cheated.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest living on a very remote farm in Pennsylvania. He lost his faith following the tragic death of his wife in a car accident. Also living on the farm are Graham's children Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin), and Graham's younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Merrill was once a minor league baseball player, famous for hitting the longest ever shot but, paradoxically, famous for suffering the most strike-outs in the history of the sport. One morning, the Hess family discover a huge crop circle in their field. Their initial bewilderment gradually gives way to paranoia and fear as they learn from the TV news that such crop circles have been appearing all over the world. Before long, UFOs are sighted above cities and scaly alien creatures are filmed sneaking around on Earth. The Hess family fear that an invasion is imminent, with the crop circles like the one in the field adjacent to their house used as landing points. They board up their farmhouse and take refuge inside, hoping to survive the night against whatever it is that is trying to get in.All the way through the film, Shyamalan refuses to get carried away with the bigger picture of the alien invasion. We only see and hear of the destruction caused by the invaders via the Hess's TV and radio set. Instead, the story is approached directly from the perspective of the Hess family, making it much more intimate and personal than the usual alien invasion entries. Shyamalan uses seemingly insignificant little details and overlapping flashbacks to build up his story, and makes his main themes those of the power of fate and the need for faith. In fact, the whole alien-invasion aspect of the plot is relegated in terms of significance and used merely as a backcloth for the story of Graham's regaining of faith. We are being told here that EVERYTHING happens for a reason and that even the most innocuous of events or conversations has a bearing on the future. This preachy approach - almost religious, in a discreet kind of way - is likely to irritate some viewers, though the more spiritual among us might find it absorbing and affirming. ""Signs"" is very slow-paced and intricate, certainly not the kind of film that encourages repeat viewings, but in the end I think it delivers. I certainly didn't come away feeling ""terrifically let down"", as Mr Ross complained. I've seen many better films, but I've seen a heck of a lot worse too. ""Signs"" is good, suspenseful stuff, with thought-provoking themes for those who can be bothered to pursue them.",Signs
81,noralee,Boring Homage to Old Invasion Movies,3,13 December 2005,"I was about the last one in the country to go to see ""Signs"" so I guess that's why the only other people in the audience kept talking through it. The first two-thirds is a cinematographically lovely homage, practically frame by frame and certainly scene by scene, to Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" in making the quotidian scary. Though instead of one hunk, we get two in Mel Gibson and Jacquin Phoenix, and no statuesque blonde.The last third steals mightily from every 1950's alien invasion sci fi movie, and some of those are classic favorites of mine. Maybe Shyamalan figures no one watches black and white movies anymore or maybe it's just more homage.Either way, I was bored.(originally written 9/29/2002)",Signs

I don't understand why are people saying it's stupid. They say the aliens would have never attacked the earth since it's based on water - their weakness. I mean, did humans knew what's the difference on the moon before landing on it? Nope, yet they still landed on it, so how should have aliens knew the water is dangerous if they never got into any contact with it in the first place? I don't think they had great technology, I don't think those aliens were scientists or anything, just because they had spaceships does not mean they could test stuff in distance.

85,TOMNEL,M. Night Shyamalan's annoying direction style actually works here!,9,18 June 2008,"Mr. Shyamalan has made three good movies in my opinion (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs), which happen to be his three consecutive drama/thrillers. Shyamalan's most recent films may have some good qualities to them, but they aren't exceptional in any way because of his poor and repetitive direction. In Signs, he got lucky that his direction of the actors happened to work. In every one of his movies, he has the actors at moment of ""extreme drama"" whisper to each other, no matter where they are, and it's a strange and usually ineffective technique. Here, for some reason it worked...probably because Mel Gibson is a good enough actor to actually convey the drama that was meant to be shown in the scenes. Shyamalan also does this annoying thing where he has a character ask another character something and they look away and give a belated answer of a nod or a small head shake. These techniques don't seem that bad, but when every movie he makes has the same character direction, you wonder how diverse or good of a director this person actually is. Luckily, any of his techniques were lost among the powerful script, enthralling story and overall real drama that this movie has.Alien crop circles are appearing various places all over the world. One of them is on the Hess's farm. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is an ex-priest who lost his faith after his wife was killed in a car accident. Also living on the farm are his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and his two kids Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin). Aliens start appearing on the farm, never actually visible, usually hiding in the cornfields, and Graham feels he must board up the house. Drama and some pretty tense and suspenseful scenes ensue.M. Night Shyamalan's screenplays seem to try to be deep, and this movie actually felt sort of deep. Not to give away any spoilers, but signs can be found in many ways, not just in the crop fields. The movie is funny when it's trying to be, and sad when it's trying to be, and even at times it sent a chill down my spine from some of the scares thrown in, and they aren't just the typical jump scares. The characters are likable and pretty easy to connect with as real people. It can be slow at times, which is true with any of the director's (I'm tired of writing out his last name) movies, but most of the slow scenes added to character development. Up to this point M. Night was known for his surprising twist endings, and the ending is sort of a twist here, but it was also just a great ending.I've come to realise that M.N.S. is not as great a writer or director as he was once touted, but he still has made some really good movies, and this was a wonderful one. Please Mr. Shyamalan, come out of your stage of mediocrity and come up with another great movie like this one!My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 110 mins. PG-13 for terror and language.",Signs
86,Agent10,Suspense with a twist of science fiction,8,2 August 2002,"From the opening shot to the very last, Signs takes you on a trip that creeps into your subconscious, instilling actual fear into your heart instead of creating bad sound effects to instill terror. While M. Night Shyamalan has yet to top The Sixth Sense, this is easily his second best film, making a movie packed with suspense and imagination unlike recent horror flicks. Overall, the film as a whole is quite good. With the exception of some nitpicky details within the film (like the ending and the boffo alien make-up), this stands as one of the cooler films to come out this summer, if not the coolest. Mel Gibson's portrayal as a tortured ex-reverend is wonderfully portrayed, especially moments where his faith is put deeply into doubt. I would most likely watch this film again, for too few films this summer could carry that distinction.What I especially enjoyed about this film was the relatively fast pace. While Shyamalan's films have been notorious for being painfully slow due to the lack of editing, this film moves along to a different tempo. I also give kudos to the sound department, who excelled mightily in establishing mood and tension through the simple sounds of footsteps and creaking floors. This also was a change of pace for Shyamalan in regards to pacing. Instead of waiting for a good forty minutes to introduce us to the gist of the story, we get a look at the aliens right away, making the viewer long for more.",Signs
87,aidanratesmovies,A lot better than I had anticipated,9,11 September 2020,"With some surprisingly well executed performances, and a very moving script, Signs is not only a success, but a very unique, and well crafted psychological thriller. The casting choices in the film seemed very odd to me at first glance, having not seen the film yet, but now that I have, I can't say there would be anyone better in the roles than this group. Mel Gibson is great as always, as well as Joaquin Phoenix, and a surprisingly decent performance from the two kid actors involved. However, as far as standouts go, Shamalayn's brilliant script is what I truly leave this film remembering. The script is intelligent, well paced, emotional, and disturbing in the best of ways. It may seem on screen that not a lot is going on, but due to Night's clever direction and atmospheric take on his material, you never feel bored. It always feels like something is there to capture your interest, whether it be the situations at hand, the well rounded characters, or simply the clever aesthetics that this film has so well versed throughout. I will say the conclusion of the film was a bit abrupt, as well as a bit choppy, but it still wins you over more than not. I enjoyed the look and style of the alien like creatures throughout the film, at least until they got too close, than it was just obvious how fake it was. In the end, Signs was a surprisingly delightful sci-fi flick that I wouldn't mind watching again sometime. It makes use of most of its potential, it's great cast, and its clever direction and writing from Night whose take on the film seems to fit like a glove. No one would be better to direct this film.

88,questl-18592,"Signs, They are a Changin'",5,30 September 2020,"I never really cared for this movie. Watching it this time, my opinion on it has improved a bit but it's still nothing particularly special. Performances are solid, but no one is really at their best but they aren't phoning it in. The plot is riddled with nonsense and symbolism and...You know what, when it comes right down to it, I think if you put this movie in someone else's hands, it's potentially better. Shyamalan just can't help himself, he lacks restraint and winds up doing his usual thing, which is having an interesting concept, recycling some old tropes, getting too pretentious about it and then crashing and burning. His cameo is really all the proof here. It's overly self-serious, out of place and... God the ending of this movie makes me mad.Yup, I'm remembering why I didn't like it. Score isn't going up as much as I thought and Shyamalan will remain the greatest director that never was. So much potential and hope squandered again and again. This is one of his few ""good"" movies and it's really not all that great. The only reason I could see recommending this is for the pop culture status it has, or for people just really into alien movies. Everyone else can probably skip it and go watch Unbreakable instead.",Signs
89,ShootingShark,Is It Possible That There Are No Coincidences ?,7,13 June 2009,"Graham Hess is a recently widowed farmer. One night, strange patterns appear in his corn crops, the family dogs start acting weird, there are odd noises at night and the water tastes funny. What is going on, and will Graham be able to protect his family from it ?Shyamalan is a great director with many strengths, but for me two things distinguish him from his contemporaries. Firstly, he has a very old-fashioned film sensibility; he goes for low-key effects and overall mood rather than big showstopping scenes, and secondly, he has a classical sense of film grammar, with long, simple, direct shots that tell his stories with grace, simplicity and charm. He's almost like Jacques Tourneur or Sam Fuller in the modern age of cinema. From literally the first shot, he starts to build tension and suspense with carefully constructed characters we come to believe in and care about, despite all the craziness to follow. The story might have familiar elements (some scenes are reminiscent of the stunning child abduction sequence in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind) but the picture keeps us off guard all the time, never knowing quite what to believe. Is there really an alien invasion taking place ? If so, what do they want ? Is Mel Gibson really playing a wimp ? Shyamalan weaves in his fate versus circumstances versus freewill theme with a deft touch; Merrill's batting style and Morgan's asthma may have spoiled their pasts but end up saving their lives. It's a very positive message within a juicily scary and disturbing film. James Newton Howard's music is terrific, eerily setting the scene and as unsettling in its absence as when it's tingling our spines and pulling our heartstrings. The two kids are terrific, Phoenix is solid support and Gibson does very well in the risky part of a man crushed by tragedy, fear and incomprehension. The sequence in the basement where he holds and talks his son through life-threatening breathing convulsions is bravura acting. Shyamlan also appears in his customary small role, here as a drunk driver. This is a great cryptic horror/suspense film, oozing atmosphere and drama in equal parts, made by a guy who doesn't pull his punches and never kowtows to Hollywood expectations.",Signs

His direction and a great cinematography make this film a unique experience.If you don't like movies about aliens and supernatural things you can still like Signs. It goes much further. It is about faith and about the questions if everything happens for a reason or not, if everything is meant to be or everything is just coincidence.Mel Gibson has a very strong performance.

91,truemythmedia,Shyamalan at His Best,9,11 June 2019,"In my opinion, ""Signs"" is M. Night Shyamalan's best film. It has the most developed theme, reinforced by its climactic sequence. It has the best acting with Mel Gibson (Braveheart) and Joaquin Phoenix (You Were Never Really Here) digging deep for complex characters that can portray both the gravity of their situation and the lightheartedness of family. It's a movie that promises suspense and delivers on it with the slow build of an eerie atmosphere more than just jump scares.One of the things that sets great movies apart is their approach to theme. This is typically one of the first big developmental jumps we as serious cinephiles make as we consume more and more films. We start to realize that talking about what a movie is about is not as useful as talking about either its plot or theme.If I ask a person what the movie Spiderman is about, they might tell me that it's about a guy who gets bit by a spider, gains super powers, and has to defeat his best friend's dad who has gone crazy and become a domestic terrorist. On the other hand, they may tell me it's about personal responsibility and the consequences of our choices.Both of them would be right. The first was describing the plot, and the second, the theme. Most films have a theme they are trying to convey but the more of a blockbuster tentpole the movie is, the more likely that the theme will play second fiddle to the plot.What is the theme of ""Avengers: Infinity War?"" Not as important as showing the plot. There may be a few scenes that talk about themes like sacrifice, but ultimately, the film is about Thanos attacking and being stronger than the Avengers.Great films and filmmakers find a way to do more than that. They weave the theme into the plot scenes so that when Maximus is fighting Commodus, it isn't just a man fighting another man. It is a system of thought, an idea, fighting another.One of my screenwriting teachers taught me something that has stuck with me more than any other.""Every scene in a movie should be about the theme. Every conversation should be about the theme. Every set, montage sequence and character action should be a part of a continuing discussion about the theme.""This is where ""Signs"" excels above M. Night's other films. The exploration of the theme of faith and the dark night of the soul is expertly unfolded through out the film in a way that is rare for a mainstream studio summer release. Usually, when a theme like this is explored, it is weighty and full of long conversations between characters about the nature of God. Sure, there are a couple of those, but on the whole, there is nothing in this film like in ""Silence"" where every conversation seems to be directly about that theme.",Signs

Spoilers below!!!!!As always, Shymalion leaves us with a heartfelt, longish, detailed, intelligent flick, heavy on the spiritual underpinnings. I really enjoyed the 'Small farmer caught up in an Alien Invasion' angle, the pastoral slant added something to this whole thing.Mel Gibson as always was his convincing self, playing a character in his craggy believable way. I kinda wonder if he was under-written some, certainly the guy in 'Soldier's Story' had more to say about the world around him than Father Graham. Oh well.Joaquin Phoenix-very good. Grabs the 'Wonderboy bat'(from the Natural) inside the Spiritual Cornfield(from Field of Dreams) and takes out the Alien Boogler(who looks like the Creature from the Black Lagoon) towards the end. Gibson and him as brothers-well, okay, the age gap is a leap.....Loved the kids' performances, Caulkins are prodigies under 12 and the little girl, dead on. Touches such as the little tinfoil hats, the half-full water glasses, you just can't get better than that.It was interesting to see the coverage of the Aliens landing, compare it to say 'ID4' or 'Men in Black'. Somewhat sensational but not over-done.
I kept on thinking of 'Twilight Zone' and 'X-files', though this does have an element of 'Scooby Doo' too-locked closets, monsters in darkened halls, the beast in the corn lurking round. All nicely done. Symalion is big, big big on atmosphere, tone, mood.

Shyamalan did the right thing in not letting the viewer see the aliens and it really builds up the suspense and tension to an unbelievable level. And the story of Mel Gibson losing his faith is handled well also. Shyamalan has always been an excellent writer and in his films the big story has always been nothing more than backdrop to the characters. Like I said, I didn't care for the ending.

The cast is average, I saw no big acting. The story is intriguing, involving and when the director wants to startle the audience, he does it very well. The knife scene was so intense that a girl friend of mine kept screaming for some seconds, while I was motionless because of it's impact.Also, it is interesting and real the fact that some religious people start questioning their own faith in God when some relative dies.

97,Rob_Taylor,"A flawed film, but still worth a watch.",5,23 December 2002,"OK. Well I'm in two minds about Signs. On the one hand, it was nice to see a semi sci-fi movie that wasn't filled with special effects and didn't suffer for the lack of them. On the other hand, the plot was about as difficult to guess from the start as the plot to Titanic. Note that there are some spoilers in the following paragraphs.I hadn't realised M Night Shyamalan directed this until afterwards, but the similarities with Unbreakable and Sixth Sense are apparent. There's the same sort of unearthly theme running throughout all the films.However, the tension built quite nicely and although I kept expecting the film to degenerate into Independance Day, it never did, to its credit.On the other hand, from the first ""Father....Please don't call me Father"" line that Mel delivers, it was obvious this was going to be about finding one's faith again. Frankly, I think the film would have been better if Gibson's character had gone the other way at the end, but that's just my opinion.As the tension builds and it looks increasingly like the aliens are going to finish the human race, I couldn't help but think that some kind of Deus ex Machina ending was on the cards. Sure enough, the aliens are defeated by water, of all things.This is where Signs began to loose points in my mind. I'd already been somewhat amused by the fact that the aliens could apparently be defeated by something as simple as a pantry door but later, could get into a boarded up house. But then it rains and their whole invasion is called off? Was it raining everywhere at once? For creatures that had travelled from who knows where to get to Earth and could make their ships invisible, didn't they think to bring a raincoat? If they'd visited Earth before, you'd think they'd have noticed the fact that it's a very wet planet.The ending isn't even that original. I can think of two films, War of the Worlds and Day of the Triffids, where the enemy are defeated by such simple means.It's a good concept for a film and it's sad that the aliens weren't thought out a little more beforehand.

It's the subtle horror of an alien invasion, in a typical M. Night fashion we don't really get to take a good look at the supposed villains. All of this really does work, but not for two hours. And the customary twist ending doesn't really deliver either, it just ruins things. If you can even call the ending a twist, things just suddenly stop making sense. I know were supposed to be amazingly intrigued by this oh-so mysterious situation and the foreshadowing of the dead wife, but I just can't get there. And was the hint the wife gave really necessary? It's a pretty basic plan, they could have thought of it all by themselves. Perhaps Shyamalan is just too much of a one-trick pony. Get a basic story, add a little mystery, throw logics out of the window, and there you have it. It worked so well in his first two features though, we'll always have those.",Signs

All seems to be normal now, but when he finds a giant crop circle in the middle of his corn fields and several similar events happen all over the world, he really doesn't know what to think anymore. His children believe it is the work of extra-terrestrials, but his brother Merill is convinced that some local pranksters did it. But soon they realize that this is a lot bigger than they could ever imagine and all that is really sure is that something bad is about to happen...Some people pointed out that the end of the movie was so bad that it spoiled all the rest. Well, I can't really find myself in that opinion. It's true that the end could have been better, but in my opinion it still contributes to the whole of the movie. Still, it was one of the weakest parts of the entire movie, which most of the time offered plenty of suspense and thrills and some decent acting. Certainly worth noticing is the young Abigail Breslin who is nice to watch and who did a terrific job despite her young age. All the others like Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin did a pretty good job as well, but she was the one that I really noticed.Overall this is a decent movie that will please all people who are interested in phenomenons like aliens and UFO's, but even when you aren't a big fan of such stories (I'm one of them), this movie is worth a watch because it is a lot better than the average Sci-Fi film. Mr. Shyamalan proves with this movie that perhaps he isn't a master in writing dialogs, but that he sure knows the techniques to make a movie suspenseful and interesting to watch. I give it a 7/10.",Signs

Something seems to be creeping about in the tall, rustling corn crops, which seems to draw upon a Stephen King short story for its particular inspiration.The crisis arrives, and the aliens lay siege to the Gibson family home, which is little more than a big clapboard shack.Unfortunately, these aliens who can travel across the galaxy in flying-saucers encounter something quite beyond their experience and - it seems - utterly defeating: the doors have locks!

101,brando647,More thrills from Shyamalan...,8,26 May 2005,"One day I would love to work with M. Night Shyamalan for two reasons: 1) he generally films in Pennsylvania, my home state, and 2) I am quickly becoming a fan of his movies. I loved ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village"" was decent, but ""Signs"" is my favorite of his movies. The entire movie, start to finish, has a tense, creepy atmosphere (partially due to James Newton Howard's score).""Signs"" is about the Hess family living on a farm in rural Pennsylvania. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former Reverend who lost his faith in religion after the loss of his wife. Joaquin Phoenix plays his brother, Merrill. Mysterious crop circles appear overnight in the Hess' corn field, and soon begin sprouting up in locations all over the world. Tensions soon rise both in the Hess home and worldwide as the meaning of these symbols is gradually made clear. This movie touches on the topics of faith and the belief that everything happens for a reason.I wouldn't say this movie is very deep, despite its thought-provoking conversations, but it is definitely fun to watch. I love how Shyamalan's movie once again proves that showing less can be scarier than showing everything. The suspense builds as you are right there with the Hess family as they are terrorized by an unseen enemy.The acting in this movie has a coldness to it, every line delivered with seriousness. Even by the children. While I thought it awkward at first, I soon overlooked it as it added to the mood. For fans of Shyamalan, this movie is a must.",Signs
102,moviewizguy,Best M. Night Film So Far!,9,26 June 2007,"After the death of his wife in a freak accident, Reverend Graham Hess questions his faith and even leaves the church. Six months later, he discovers a gigantic crop circle in his yard. Similar events happen all over the world. Graham's children think it's aliens, his brother thinks it's pranksters, and Graham doesn't know what to think. However, as more and more strange events occur, he realizes something big is coming, and it's probably not going to be friendly.I would simply love to say this is one of the best science fiction film and one of the best films ever made. It's a masterpiece. It's brilliant. I loved every minute of it. From one of the best title sequences ever made to the ending. First of all, this is not a CGI blockbuster. I mean, literally, there are a few action scenes in this film, abnormal for an alien invasion film. I love the idea! it's original and the story is more about the family and what they are going through.The film's score is great! This is probably James Newton Howard's best work he has ever done! The music provides something mysterious and obviously give homages to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Psycho. I also love the simplicity of the film. There's nothing too complex right here. Everything is just there in front of the screen while you go in ""awe"".I also liked the camera-work done. Another great thing from this is the use of suspense and tension. The first time I've ever seen this (I've seen this movie many times already), it made me crap my pants and I'm not usually scared in movies. In this movie, less is certainly more. Each information is given off little by little until the big finale.I liked the subtle humor in this film. It's certainly not laugh-out-loud funny but it's great to laugh when you're filled with suspense. Mel Gibson's performance is fantastic as well as Joaquin Phoenix. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin were good too.This film is certainly underrated. Most people didn't like it for the twist ending or the overall conclusion of the movie. It's not that bad, really. It's ridiculous that they don't like the movie for that reason. I even liked this better than The Sixth Sense! This is why people make movies! This film is not just another alien invasion movie. It has many underlying themes to those who want to look deeper into the film.It has a fantastic script, brilliant score, terrific performances, great camera-work, extremely underrated, and is one of the best films ever made! I loved it that much! Do not go into this movie thinking of a CGI-filled film (although it has a $70 million budget) because it's trying to be much more than that.",Signs
103,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Signs""- Perhaps the last truly great film from writer/director M. Night Shyamalan.",10,14 September 2016,"M. Nighy Shyamalan is one of the strangest figments to emerge in Hollywood the past twenty years. After a few obscure low-budget features, in 1999 he struck gold with the incredible and heartfelt thriller ""The Sixth Sense."" Audiences and critics alike were wowed by his unique vision of terror and emotion. With a newfound fame, Shyamalan continued this streak with the underrated drama ""Unbreakable""- a subversive and genre- bending take on the superhero origin story, boasting strong performances and some truly gut- wrenching sequences. And then he struck gold once again with this film, his third- ""Signs"", yet another critical and commercial darling that takes on the alien invasion tale with his unique voice.Then, tragedy struck. His next few films, ""The Village"", ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening"" suffered increasingly diminishing returns in terms of their critical and audience reaction as people began to wise up to his style and form of storytelling. By the time he got to ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth"", the good-will his first three major releases earned him was all but completely gone.Thankfully, he's had a bit of a rebound the past few years. His television series ""Wayward Pines"" and his found-footage horror/comedy ""The Visit"" received generally positive critical reception and were moderate hits with their audiences. And his next feature ""Split"" looks to continue this trend with trailers promising a spooky and amusing romp about a killer with a split personality.But let's take a look at ""Signs"", a film that on the whole, seems to at this time be his last great film. The last movie that really delivered 100% on his promising beginning. And a film that I still greatly appreciate and feel is among the finest Sci-Fi thrillers in quite some time.The tale is a surprisingly intimate one, following a a former priest named Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) who lost his faith after the tragic death of his wife. When crop-circles appear in his field, and then begin to appear soon after at an alarming rate all over the world, it appears that humanity may soon be at risk from an extra- terrestrial invasion. Together with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and children (Abigail Breslin, Rory Culkin), Graham must find a way to protect his family from this very real threat, all while combating his own inner turmoil surrounding his lost faith.What makes the film work is just how subdued, methodical and realistic a portrait Shyamalan paints. Whereas most alien-invasion thrillers aim to build scope of spectacle and wow audiences with worldwide destruction, Shyamalan wisely instead places his focus on a singular family unit, and builds the scope and spectacle from their emotional journey of intrigue, fear and survival. He knows that no matter how many buildings explode or how many gooey CGI aliens he could throw at the screen, none of it matters if we don't have characters to root for. So, he eschews essentially every single cliché and convention of sci-fi thrillers to instead craft a really interesting and emotional drama.The performances are also of a magnificent quality. While he's become something of a laughing stock in recent years (and deservedly so) due to his... ""eccentricities"", Mel Gibson shines as a man haunted by his past an unsure of his future. It's one of those films that shows just why we loved Gibson so much. And how badly it hurt when it was revealed just how corrupt and nasty a man he was. Joaquin Phoenix is a lot of fun as Graham's younger and more boisterous brother. And Breslin and Culkin give good, fascinating takes on their unique child characters. (Though admittedly Breslin isn't the world's greatest child-actor in this role.)Shyamalan is at the top of his game here with his writing and visual storytelling. Dialog strikes a fine balance between realism and that delightfully disconnected ""Shyamalan tone"", which lends itself well to the otherworldly themes. The story is perfectly structured to compliment the themes of invasion, lost faith and the support of family meaning everything. And the writing also exquisitely builds tension with an expert tone that builds through every scene. And his camera- work and use of clever visual motifs have never been better. It really is a tragedy that this might be the last great Shyamalan film. While I did adore ""The Visit"" and enjoy ""Wayward Pines"", he's still got a bit of an uphill battle to fight if he's ever to earn back all of the respect and admiration he held just a few short years ago.But I hope he wins that battle, because the world needs at least one more Shyamalan masterpiece like this.""Signs"" is a perfect 10.",Signs
104,Luigi Di Pilla,I expected more!!,6,27 April 2003,"Yes, I expected more and I am disappointed. I`m asking how could this movie total an amount of more than 200 Mio. US$ at the theatres? Well, the plot is alright but it is not well packed as a convincing and really chilling blockbuster. During two thirds of the story nothing goes on and you wait and wait till something happens. The rest is all déjà vu. It is a low budget movie with no special effects. Okay I've got the message having hope in God but this I know since I am a little boy. I think this time the director failed completely after his last average movie ""Unbreakable"". Some critics I read on imbd said it seems Hitchcocks ""The Birds"". I don´t think so. ""The Birds"" is better, has more suspense and is a real edge-of-your-seat-thriller and it is still actual. I continue to believe that director Night Shymalan has great potential of turning better thrillers than this one. If you want to watch it I highly recommend you to rent it before you buy. You will appreciate my advice.Too overrated. Maximal 6/10.",Signs
105,zsenorsock,"Sign, Sign, Everywhere a Sign",6,7 August 2002,"Mel Gibson stars as a former pastor who has lost his faith in thelatest effort by M. Night Shyamalan. ""Signs"" is a return to form forthe writer/director of ""The Sixth Sense "" who stumbled a bit with hislast outing, ""Unbreakable"". While this is no ""Sixth Sense "" it isgood, compelling storytelling. When mysterious unexplained crop circles appear overnight in hisPennsylvania cornfield, Gibson and the local authorities figure itsthe work of local pranksters. But soon the patterns appear in fieldsall over the world. It becomes obvious something global is aboutto happen. Convinced by his wife's accidental death several months ago thatthere is no God watching over people, Gibson decides he and hisfamily can only depend on themselves, whatever happens. Sojoined by his brother, a failed minor league ballplayer (JoaquinPhoneix) Gibson's son (Rory Culkin) (yes, ANOTHER Culkin) andhis irrestibly cute daughter (Abigal Breslin) the family prepares forwhatever might happen.A lot happens, but I won't ruin it for you. You should go see foryourself.A suspense thriller, ""Signs"" is never gory or gross and bloody.Instead, director Shyamalan masterfully builds up the tension in Hitchcockian fashion. There's no nudity, but there's nobody in thisfilm you want to see naked anyway. Shyamalan must learn that inaddition to making films suspenseful, Hitchcock never forgot tothrow in a Grace Kelly or a Kim Novak or Janet Leigh. I must tellhim this next time I see him at the club.Another weakness is Shyamalan's Tarantino-like decision to casthimself in a key role. It's not that he's bad in it, he's not; but hispresence in the picture and the way he is introduced totallydistracts from the film's central story. M. (a Fritz Lang homage?)would be better off limiting his acting to a brief Hitchcock likecameo and hiring real actors to act.Some people have complained a bit about the film's ending notliving up to the rest of the picture, and I can see their point.However, I enjoyed the storytelling enough to give that a pass.Besides I rather like campy 1950's sci-fi films, so I had no problemwith the ending.What I had a problem with is Rory Culkin.  Are these kids beingcloned now or what? There seems to be a never ending supply ofthese Culkin kids. When one grows up and is no longer cute, twomore spring up to take its place. This is perhaps the real invasionwe have to worry about: the attack of the Culkins. Now that bigbrother MacCaulay ""Home Alone"" (with his 22 brothers andsisters--Christian, Kieran, Quinn, Shane, Rory, etc. etc.) Culkin is21, I expect he'll be pumping out more replacement Culkin kidsbefore too long. And then his brothers and sisters will be oldenough to have kids, and then his kids will have kids and beforeyou know it, we'll be running in the streets screaming like that guyin ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".""Help! Wait! Stop. Stop and listen to me!...These Culkins who'recoming after me are not human. Look, you fools. You're in danger.Can't you see? They're after you. They're after all of us.

106,valadas,The Message,6,24 November 2002,Yes this movie has got a more or less clear message in religious terms therefore it will be viewed from different angles depending on if you are a believer or an unbeliever. The former will find it a great movie while the latter will think it's a complete nonsense. For agnostics like myself the message will be disregarded and we'll prefer to concentrate our attention on the filmic discourse. Well it's a sci-fi thriller as you probably already know and a just passable one I mean it has no special flaws to be denounced but no special inventive or original features either. The story unfolds itself in somewhat predictable developments and the acting is neither bad nor particularly good maybe with the exception of the 2 kids who deserve a special mark though the boy seems to be a little too gifted for his age but we are used to that already in children roles. Well summing it up if the night is too cold and if you are an unbeliever or an agnostic stay comfortably at home and don't lose your time going out to see this movie.,Signs

Mel Gibson is a great actor and with support from Joaquin Pheonix in a film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, i couldn't wait to see this film.I saw it during its week of release, and didn't expect the kind of frights and tension that we saw in the Sixth Sense, given its (12) Rating, but by the end of the movie, a group of young teenagers sat a few rows in front of me, were genuinely terrified and had spent much of the movie crying. It's not because the film was horrific, it's entirely due to the masterful creation of suspense and frights that Shyamalan has. He seems to be able to bring out the best in his cast, whatever their age, and he can retain the tension of a moment with ease.Believe me, to get the best from this film, turn out the lights, turn up the surround sound system and watch it alone, and if your can't feel the spine tingling terror, than i pity you, because your missing psychological effects of the this fine film.I hope Mr. Shyamalan has a long and successful career, and with films like Signs and Sixth Sense already under his belt, i'm sure he will.9/10",Signs
109,MartianOctocretr5,Entertaining But Flawed,5,25 April 2006,"Signs is watchable and entertaining, but has quite a few plot holes to the point of being cheesy. If the intent of the movie was to simply be a fun ""popcorn movie"" diversion, it succeeds on that level. It appears, though, the intent was to approach philosophical insights, or to convince the audience of the authenticity of crop circles as alien-authored. On such issues, it self-destructs.The main problem with the film seems to be this schizophrenic confusion about which direction it wants to go, thus dooming it to fail on the serious side of the ledger. There's plenty of involving action with ""things that go bump in the night,"" but the story forgets to pursue the deep issues it brought up. The story careens madly back and forth between serious overtones and sublimely ridiculous nonsense.For example, there is a scene of an auto accident victim talking to someone: A dying person who has been chopped in half does not wax prophetic--they scream in pain, or lose consciousness. Due to the odd premise of a mutilated person standing there to give a message, this scene, which apparently seeks extreme pathos, simply ends up looking like cheap, contrived exploitation. The scene with the baby-monitor intercepting transmissions from beyond Earth? Must be a joke, right? But if this was supposed to be a joke, it was played too straight to be recognizable as one. In places, therefore, the movie takes itself way too seriously.More inanities: The stupidity of the aliens, who have mastered interplanetary travel, but are ignorant to a toxic aspect of our environment? Plot holes this preposterous should not be escaping the eyes of directors of big budget flicks. Also, why are they leaving messages in cornfields for everyone to see, if they're plotting a raid on the planet? Why don't they just radio each other as they coordinate their attack? Oops, forgot: We have baby-monitors to spy on them with; consequently, they are limited to hacking up cornfields in order to communicate. The baseball bat silliness was almost too foolish to endure.Still, the movie has its moments. I particularly love the scene with the aluminum foil hats. The plot, albeit silly, moves along. Plenty of stuff happens up there on the screen, and you can suspend disbelief enough to have a good time. The acting is actually quite good, especially Mel Gibson, who breaks from his ""Mad Max"" persona. Here he plays a despondent man struggling through an emotional crisis, and he plays this vulnerable character with sincerity. For some mindless fun, this film provides with gusto. Just don't expect this movie to be a convincing argument about the supernatural. It has far too many obvious goofs in its execution to accomplish that.",Signs

The movie is creepy, intense and filled with solid performances from Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin.

111,dunmore_ego,Cream of the Crop Circles.,9,6 April 2009,"SIGNS is a storytelling masterpiece from writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan; a master moviemaker's layered mosaic of fear, faith, family - and alien invasion.Like every Night thriller, SIGNS is not of the Running and Screaming stripe, rather, a beautifully crafted lesson in film ""making""; creative angles, smart reveals, subtle foreshadowing, tension-filled tableaux, nuanced humor. No frame wasted, no scene superfluous, no Night un-Shyamalaned.Mel Gibson is widower Reverend Graham Hess, a priest who has lost his faith, one day waking on his farm to discover - crop circles. Resurrecting that grand hoax, Shyamalan comes right out and attributes crop circles to extra-terrestrial aliens. But the aliens are the McGuffin - we only see this ""invasion"" through snippets on TV news and one chilling scene at a children's party. SIGNS concerns itself only with Graham's family and their unbidden involvement in this world-shaking event.Joaquin Phoenix is Merrill, Graham's brother, helping him tend his farm and raise Graham's two young kids, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin in sensational performances). In most films, when a person ""loses their faith"" it doesn't mean they have come to their senses - it means they are waiting for some supernatural event to turn them BACK to that faith. Graham stopped practicing priesty things after the death of his wife, run down by a town local that fell asleep at the wheel (M. Night himself, in his usual Hitchcock-ian cameo). Usually a gutless filmic device, Night uses Graham's loss of faith as part of a much bigger picture, working it as another reference to the movie's title.The crux of SIGNS is a foreboding monologue that Graham shares with Merrill, about ""two kinds of people"" - the type that believe someone is watching over us, and the type that believe no one is. As they watch television reports of crop circles and hovering spaceships appearing throughout the world, Graham confesses his wife's unnecessary death made him cross over from ""someone"" to ""no one."" Religionists regard this as a tragedy. The only tragedy was his wife's death. ""Losing faith"" is the best thing that could happen to anyone in this delusional society - they become responsible for the first time in their lives. What Religionists fail to realize is that if no one is watching over us, we are the rulers of our own destiny. Why imagine some great clockmaker planning our floods, quakes, flat tires and stubbed toes? We forgive Night these pseudo-theological forays because every scene in SIGNS ratchets the tension higher; Night can conjure fear from the whisper of the wind, a rustle in the cornstalks, a hand groping under a pantry door.The passive ominousness of crops laying flat shows us we don't need screaming chase scenes to create excitement, nor knives stabbed through eyes to create horror - all it takes is a shift in normalcy: a shadowy figure on the roof, clicking sounds on a baby monitor, a shin disappearing into foliage.James Newton Howard's chilling, eerie, evocative soundtrack only raises the hairs more.Every subplot in SIGNS is a sign itself, as it jigsaws into the fabric of the last scene, where the Hess family confront a full frontal alien, left behind after the ""invasion"" forces abandon Earth. Graham finds that everything his wife said to him with her dying breath attains fruition to save their lives - from Bo's obsession with leaving ""contaminated"" water glasses around the house, to Morgan's asthma attacks, and Merrill's impulsive cannonball batting arm. ""Tell Merrill... swing away!"" Many people try to find signs, allegories and messages in movies with this tone, but few deride SIGNS for being absolutely bereft of intelligence when it advocates predestination. Graham's wife, while pinned to a tree by Night's car, blabbers all the info Graham will need to save his life later, explained away by Graham as ""the last sparks of her brain firing arbitrarily."" You lost me at medulla oblongata.Predestination negates free will. I've said it at least 4,560,670 times. But Christians never seem to get it. Graham actually believes - as many viewers do - that events can be foretold by a dying woman who was fed information by some outside source powerful enough to mind-meld with her (yet not powerful enough to keep the car from hitting her); an outside source with such dubious discernment that it would relate life-saving info through a dying woman instead of simply mind-melding the info into the living people who needed that info. Smart. Graham's ""faith"" must have been Church of Nostradamus, or whatever you prophesy weirdoes call yourselves - oh, that's right: Christians.But I forgive Night. Because SIGNS suspends our disbelief so artfully even with the contradiction of predestination. The love and closeness of Graham's family bedrocks their adversity, and the performances breathe beyond three dimensions. What can we say about Joaquin and Mel? Both have wells of emotion so deep and nuanced, it makes us wonder why their shelves are not creaking with Oscars.As one day, M. Night Shyamalan must surely be recognized by that insular, backslapping academy. All they need is a sign.Or SIGNS.",Signs
112,capkronos,Wake up! Signs borrows HEAVILY from Night of the Living Dead.,5,5 August 2002,"I just want to point out one thing here that people are too blind to see--It needs to be made perfectly clear that M. Night Shyamalan borrows heavily from low-budget horror classics that never got the attention they deserved in their day. THE SIXTH SENSE, Shyamalan's breakthrough hit, stole it's entire central conceit (lead character really dead for the entirety of film, unbeknownst to us viewers) from the low-budget Kansas-shot classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS, which had, in turn, borrowed the idea from an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode. Everyone praised SENSE'S ""originality"" while CARNIVAL got shelved and badly distributed over the years. Now we get SIGNS, which is pushing into religious territory as filtered through Spielbergian fashion Americans love so much.Come on folks, you have seen this film before. Wake up and look at the SIGNS...Pennsylvania farm house, boarded up, being invaded by scary things in the dark while the terrified inhabitants look for answers by watching TV news broadcasts that come and go... That's the same plot as George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD substituting aliens for zombies, isn't it? Even though Romero was interested in tapping into racism, sexism and human interaction, while Shyamalan is using the crop circles plot to focus on a different kind of interaction (man and God), it still angers me that a high-profile director can do a film like this and get endless applause when they borrow so many ideas from others who got pigeonholed, ignored and ridiculed.Even though I walked away from this film with a bizarre aftertaste, I'm going to be fair by saying it is subtle, focused, sensitive, well-acted and tense in parts. But it's also time to give George Romero credit for his massive impact on fantasy, sci-fi, horror and suspense films and it's time for people to go back to the original horror classics and understand where the so-called ""new and original"" ideas present here, and in so many other big-budget blockbusters, stem from.Score: 5 out of 10.",Signs

This is a good one.The film is about a widowed minister(Mel Gibson). They live on a field. When they learn of alien invasions all around the world and notice a crop circle in their field, they prepare for aliens. And that is really the story.The thing that I loved most about this film is that it is very creepy. I can sometimes get scared a little too easily. I was with this film. Definitely. Shamylan has a great way of telling a story and it's a shame that a lot of his movies nowadays aren't that good. They all suck really. I think Signs is Shamylan's best though. I also liked how the film had some funny parts. Gibson and Phoenix give good performances, even for a film like this. Signs gave me the chills. I love Alien.

My lovely friends dragged me to this and I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed for I didn't expect much, and I didn't get much. I love horror films that make you wonder, grab you and make you think. Special Effects and make up are nice, but a good frightening film without them are worth their weight in gold. This isn't one of them, for this fan of the genre. Unless you're just getting into ""scary"" films, or are under 8 and hardly ever saw a scary film, then this is the film for you. I want to be challenged, not treated as if I got a labotomy yesterday. If this film gets any ""above the line"" Academy Award nominations, then the Academy is rigged. I HATE this ""polite horror"" trend that seems to be rearing its head in filmmaking these days..or ""politically correct horror"" as I am labeling it. Come on people, get some guts, again. Demand better.Plus I was really disgusted that this was explained away with the subliminal message of ""religion"" is the only truth. I am a big fan of Religiously themed pictures as well and this makes me want to slap the face of the writer, this is so shallow work. Shame on those who think this is one of the best pictures of the year!!! To me, this ranks up there with ""Glitter"" which is not all that bad, now I've seen this.",Signs

That aliens helped me find Jesus again because there's any coincidences then there must be Jesus felt a bit weird. Seeing Joaquin Phoenix was good while I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson at all. The kid actors were good and funny with their foil hats. Their uncle being a baseball player because he swung away and the tick that the girl had made her have many glasses of water around the house and that burnt the alien and because the boy had asthma, he didn't inhale the poisonous gas. It felt a bit too melodramatic just like the mother's death scene pinned between the tree and the car (and it was hilarious). They all said aliens are smarter and this and that and made it look like as bestial as possible which didn't make any sense. The cornfield looked creepy as all cornfields look creepy for some reason and the first half had a good level of suspense but it just lost its momentum and the ending just didn't work for me.

119,DunnDeeDaGreat,Shyamalan 's best film yet,9,3 August 2002,Signs is clearly the best work I've seen M.Night Shamalan do. The Sixth Sense is overrated and Unbreakable needded more action. But with Signs Shyamlan has made a film where silence and the dark can be the most scary thing one will experience. The cinematography in the film is some of the best I've seen all summer. Shyamlan script is some what a horror film but it goes deeper than that and when you see the film you'll know what I'm talking about. Mel Gibosn and Joaquin Phoenix turn in excllent performances as usual. But it's the child actors Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin who turn stellar performances. Culkin gives a better acting job than his older brother ever did and Breslin is very good in her first role. All in all Signs is a great movie.,Signs
120,emasterslake,An alien movie with some flaws.,5,17 June 2006,"Saw it recently on TV, here are my thoughts on it.Signs is about Mel Gibson portraying an ex-priest who lives in Pennsylvania with his 2 kids and brother in law. A mysterious crop circle appears in the middle of the corn field.It was too perfectly done for it to be a prank.Mel's character at first thinks it's just done by a group of nerds who have no life or anything better to do.Eventually strange things happen. And more crop circles are shown everywhere in the world. It's said to be an end of the world.This movie isn't too perfect. It just has more suspense and less aliens. You only see an alien for 4 minutes worth in the movie. I dislike movies that don't show you what you want to see. The acting is a little dry. And the story needed some more work. Cause the ending was just blah once you see it you'll know what I mean.I know there's better Mel Gibson movies and ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind"" have much more aliens than this one.",Signs

122,classicalsteve,Very Interesting Take on a Well-Used SF Theme: SF takes a Back-seat to the Relationships of the Characters,8,13 September 2009,"You could almost make the case that ""Signs"" is probably the most spirited attempt to date to combine science fiction and chick flicks. The UFO's and aliens are there for the guys, the relationships between the characters are there for the girls. The closest analogy I can think of to describe this movie is ""Independence Day"" meets ""Ordinary People"", two films that you would never imagine being combined because their respective genres are about as polar opposites as they come. Even something like ""Field of Dreams"" meets ""King Kong"" seems more plausible. But ""Signs"" somehow works, probably because of the magic of director M. Night Shyamalan whose work is primarily in the SF/Horror genres and yet focuses a lot on character, much like Steven Spielberg. As science fiction stories go, strange sentient beings coming to Earth via UFO's goes back to the days of HG Wells' War of the Worlds near the turn of the last century. Films in which the aliens may be either benevolent or malevolent include ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""Earth Versus the Flying Saucers"", ""Invaders from Mars"", ""The Invaders"" (TV show), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Independence Day"". The list goes on and on. So my point is that the central SF idea behind ""Signs"" is certainly nothing that hasn't been penned, shot, and edited, going as far back as the silent era. What is new in ""Signs"" is that the story focuses more on the characters and their inter-relationships with each other which comes out because of the events concerning malevolent extra-terrestrials. The closest film to it may be the 1953 SF classic ""Invaders from Mars"" in which a family is abducted by space aliens.Of course, this combining of SF and drama could turn off many hardcover science fiction fans who are more interested in long action sequences in which aliens and humans battle it out, like ""War of the Worlds"" or ""Independence Day"". If you want lots of laser gun action and dog fight scenes in space, ""Signs"" will certainly leave you feeling like you were had. On the other hand, if you want a new angle on a familiar sub-genre of SF that relies less on action and more on character, you might give ""Signs"" a try. ""Signs"" could have been a really ridiculous movie if it wasn't for the fine acting of all four leads, particularly the child actors. I was absolutely stunned by the realism of the two youngsters, around the ages of 6 and 10. They are really the ones that make this movie work. Added to the mix is Mel Gibson as their father who conveys paternalistic emotions that is uncommon for him. The story is really about the father reconciling with his children because of a piece of back-story that becomes, in the end, far more important than the space aliens. The back-story which is finally revealed toward the end has almost nothing to do with the aliens except for a singular aspect. This is what makes ""Signs"" a very unique film, and just when you thought nothing more could be added to the Earth vs UFO genre.",Signs
123,Victor Field,The most intimate invasion movie ever made?,10,6 September 2002,"""The Twilight Zone"" once had an episode called ""The Invaders"" set entirely in a farmhouse, with a woman (Agnes Moorehead) battling a pair of tiny aliens; Richard Matheson, who wrote that episode, was not enamoured of the final product, claiming it was too slow and that the aliens looked ridiculous - and they do. Creatures that look like the Michelin Man are nowhere to be found in the thematically similar ""Signs,"" but it does take its time. All to the good, it turns out.Whatever the M in ""M. Night Shyamalan"" stands for, it clearly isn't ""Modest"" - he's given himself cameos in both ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" and for this movie he's upgraded himself to what's practically a supporting role, although a key one. Still, it can be forgiven when the whole thing works as well as this; set in a small Pennsylvania town, disillusioned widowed ex-priest Mel Gibson discovers that his farm has become home to some very elaborate crop circles. At first he and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) feel it's a prank, but then more start to appear... and I'll let other contributors spoil the plot. Suffice to say there's no twist ending this time, and that in spite of their prominent billing in the opening titles, Industrial Light and Magic visual effects supervisors Eric Brevig and Stefen Fangmeier are ultimately not the film's stars.The movie stays at a regular level for a lot of its length, setting up a perfectly realised world with plenty of well-judged character moments (the son's asthma, the daughter's irrational fear of drinking water, etc) - though there are plenty of intentionally amusing moments (people keep turning to Gibson's character for spiritual guidance even though he's no longer of the cloth), the movie's never allowed to become camp; when Shyamalan starts to turn the screws, the humour drains away but the tension doesn't. Most of what's happening elsewhere is related to us via the family's TV set (just as it would be in real life) and whatever the menace is is kept out of sight most of the time (until the climax, that is) - our hero's first reaction to getting a glimpse of it is to run like hell back to the house! Cowardly? Maybe, but you or I would almost certainly do the same thing...Ultimately, the ability to bring an alien invasion down to human terms, to make it more of an emotional experience than an all-out action yarn a la ""Independence Day"" is one of the biggest plusses of the movie; the finale may seem absurd to some, but in the context of the laws ""Signs"" sets itself it's no cop-out. Unlike ""The X-Files"" it doesn't try and string you along endlessly, instead bringing everything together. It's not all-out horror, but it is endlessly absorbing and pretty scary, bolstered by the director's cast, the restrained special effects, and James Newton Howard's striking score. Though it may not seem like it from the posters, ""Signs"" is ultimately very spiritual and almost uplifting; it's impossible to elaborate without ruining the movie, but those viewers who find it hard to accept that this world is all there is and that nothing just happens (and I must confess to being among that number) will find this movie very rewarding. This is a movie that hangs around.",Signs

127,vip_ebriega,'Signs' of intelligent life in Hollywood.,10,9 January 2010,"My Take: A criminally underrated thriller with some genuinely suspenseful moments and a meditation of faith.For my money, M. Night Shymalan is one of the most misunderstood directors working in Hollywood, if not the one that tops the list. With a body of work which began with the success of THE SIXTH SENSE, Shymalan has made some of the most intriguing films ever to sprout from Hollywood, even if not all of his works are great or perfect in every way. His stories are more than just superior genre entries or just-plain-weird movies, some of them also deal with some sort of personal or religious issue. Although the setup is consistent in every film, each film is always different from the last one; each new movie is something worth waiting for with the thought of how he would pull it off, even if it sort of give us a feeling of uneasiness and uncertainty.The basic premise for SIGNS can be summed up in a few words: Aliens attack a farmhouse. Former preacher widower Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) wakes up one morning to find a large crop circle in his field of corn, stunning both his kids and brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), especially when strange unseen men run around the fields at night. But SIGNS is more than just an average alien-invasion movie, or a typical sci-fi movie. In fact, SIGNS goes beyond science-fiction and into the realm of fear; it's not about giving off scientific jargon or explanations, it's just about the fear and uncertainty of the unknown. This is probably why many were so disappointed with the films big ""twist"" (which, despite a few holes, is not too big a deal). The character of a widower and problematic father has been ventured before, but this isn't the only thing tackled in the movie. There's the relevant use of a past death which affects future events in life. Then there's the question of believing in ""seeing miracles"" as opposed to believing that people ""just get lucky"", which is the whole point of the much-maligned twist ending. And the way Shymalan builds tension in the situations is something worth noting. How he uses simple everyday tools as in a Baby Monitor, a glass of water and flashlights as means to establish suspense is a triumph. He might have not been the heir of the throne of the great Hitchcock, but he sure learned a lot from him.Whereas Shymalan's other films deal with certain issues, SIGNS is about faith, bending the science-fiction genre into a drama with certain questions about faith. It's not just about questioning the existence of a God, but if He really is out there, are we willing to put our faith in Him in times of perilous situations? But Shymalan discusses these issue in a hushed tone; they never come off too preachy or overbearing. SIGNS is an example of the intriguing, albeit different, storytelling abilities of the underrated Shymalan. It's a slow-burn thriller which will still continue to divide the audience. To some, it may come off as a slow-moving science-fiction thriller. To others, myself included, it's old-fashioned film making and storytelling at its best.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Signs
128,gftbiloxi,"Much To Enjoy, But Somehow Short of the Mark",7,18 April 2005,"In a documentary that accompanies the film on DVD, M. Night Shyamalan admits that SIGNS was greatly influenced by such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS--an admission that will come as no surprise to any one who has seen SIGNS in the wake of those films. Although very different, all three have one thing in common: they ultimately focus on a small group of people fighting off an unnatural entity that attempts to invade their very ordinary homes.The story is an unusual mix of meditative religious and classic sci-fi elements blended together by Shyamalan's remarkable sense of visual style. Mel Gibson is a minister who has lost his faith in the wake of his wife's tragic accidental death and who now rejects the concept of unseen powers entirely--so he is nonplussed when his children discover a crop circle in his own cornfield. He remains skeptical even as television news coverage reports alien crafts hovering over major cities. But his denial is exploded when he and his family have a close encounter of the extremely nasty kind.The small cast is extremely, extremely good. I generally dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, but he has grown a bit since his macho-bravado BRAVEHEART days, and while he might seem an unlikely choice for the part of a failed minister he carries it extremely well. Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as Gibson's younger brother, and the children--Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin--are flawless.What isn't flawless is the story. The blend of religious and sci-fi motifs is an interesting idea, but director Shyamalan (who also wrote the script) doesn't quite manage to hold them in balance, and ultimately winds up beating you over the head with the film's religious elements while giving the sci-fi elements the short end of the stick. I did appreciate the fact that the film builds suspense more by what it does not show than what it does, and I have no qualm with that--it's a welcome choice after such special effects overkill as INDEPENDENCE DAY and the like--but several of his plot devices smack of stereotype, and the film's conclusion is such a deus ex machina that it is not to be believed. There is indeed a great deal to admire about the film, but when all is said and done it somehow lacks sincerity and falls just short of the mark. Entertaining nonetheless.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Signs
129,jhclues,Shyamalan Does It Again,10,4 August 2002,"In his most pensive and thought-provoking film yet, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan examines personal faith and explores the possibilities of predestination, in `Signs,' a riveting drama/thriller that also makes a case for the existence of extraterrestrial life in the universe; a film that questions the validity of coincidence, and puts forth the proposition that there is more going on in the vast expanses that surround our world than meets the eye.  It's Shyamalan's way of saying `We are not alone,' and he does it by whispering it in your ear rather than shouting to get your attention.  And get your attention he does, without question-- in a way that is spellbinding and unforgettable.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, awakens one morning and discovers a design, beginning with a huge circle, that has been inexplicably imprinted in the cornfield that surrounds his farm.  And he soon finds out that this is not an isolated incident; indeed, overnight the same thing has happened in fields around the world.  The burning question, of course, is who did it?  And moreover, how-- and why?  It's a mystery to which there seems to be no logical answer.  Or is it that it's too obvious, in which case it is also unbelievable.  These are questions that, over the course of the next few days, will fill every waking moment of Graham's life, as well as that of his two children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin), and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix); questions about things beyond contemplation.  Questions to which the answers can come none to soon.After his remarkable film, `The Sixth Sense,' in 1999, the question everyone was asking was how is Shyamalan going to top that?  He responded with `Unbreakable' in 2000, another remarkable film that presented a concept of evil unique in the history of the cinema.  And with this film, Shyamalan has done it again, with another unique film that is a study in subtlety and nuance.  There is a quiet intensity to this film that evokes the kind of silence in a crowed theater that is rarely encountered.  From the opening moments, Shyamalan casts a spell over his audience, then maintains it as he continues to build the suspense, right up to the very end.  He draws you in by getting up close and personal with his camera, which successfully puts you `in the room' as the drama unfolds.  It's a studied presentation, and Shyamalan sets a decidedly deliberate pace that makes it work most effectively.Shyamalan traverses territory that will be familiar to Ingmar Bergman aficionados, as he delves into one of Bergman's favorite themes, that being `God's silence,' which we find in Graham's ruminations of his own personal situation.  Add to that the best elements found in such films as `Independence Day' and `War of the Worlds,' with a dash of Rod Serling's `Twilight Zone,' and you have `Signs,' a true original, unique in it's own right and artistically and imaginatively rendered by Shyamalan, a one-of-a-kind writer/director who continues to amaze with film after film. Few directors can transfix an audience with such things as the sound of a cornfield rustling in the wind like Shyamalan can.  And he allows his scenes time to not only develop, but imply; and it's these moments of silence, in which he focuses on a doorway, or an empty swing in the yard viewed through an open window, or an intimate close-up of the expression on a character's face, that are so telling and entirely captivating.As Graham Hess, Mel Gibson certainly hits his stride with his portrayal of a man who has come to a crossroads in his life only to encounter yet another challenge that exacerbates his inner conflict even more.  Gibson has a commanding presence on screen that naturally draws the eye, and his performance here has a reserve that adds strength and depth to his character, who is dealing with some very complex issues that transcend his immediate considerations.  To make this character (and the film) work, Gibson must convey a very real sense of personal loss and a need for redemption-- and he succeeds.  Shyamalan obviously has a knack for tapping into and bringing out the best in his stars; he did it with Bruce Willis in `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable,' and he does it with Gibson here.  It's an honest portrayal that is very real, and altogether convincing.Joaquin Phoenix, too, gives a grounded performance as Merrill, a young man who has seemingly come to terms with certain aspects of his past, as well as the circumstances that have brought him to where he is at present.  The success of his portrayal comes from the fact that Phoenix manages to find the core of his character and play upon it.  It's a matter of having the kind of focus that makes the character believable, which is what Phoenix achieves here.  He also has the kind of chemistry with Gibson that makes their relationship as brothers credible, which, in turn, is essential to the overall credibility of the film.Shyamalan has also worked his magic with his young stars, Culkin and Breslin, each of whom give affecting performances.  Culkin displays a maturity beyond his years that works well for his character, especially in light of Morgan's current fragile state of being.  And Breslin is absolutely endearing as Mo, a performance reminiscent of young Heather O'Rourke's Carol Anne, in `Poltergeist.'The supporting cast includes Cherry Jones (Officer Paski), Patricia Kalember (Colleen Hess), Jose L. Rodriguez (Radio Host) and M. Night Shyamalan (Ray). A film that is intrinsically enthralling, at times frightening and genuinely eerie, `Signs' marks the accomplishment of a cinematic hat trick for M. Night Shyamalan, who is quickly becoming the new Hitchcock/Rod Serling of film, yet with his own unique signature.  This makes three `originals' in a row for Shyamalan, a rare feat even among the greatest directors.  The question now is, how is he ever going to top it?  10/10.",Signs
130,CharltonBoy,"A really good , scary movie.",8,13 February 2003,There are lots of good reasons why you should watch Signs. The main one being that it is a bloody good and entertaining movie that always has you on the edge of the seat without showing loads of gore and guts. As usual it's what you dont see that makes this movie scary. I love the parts where we see the family watching the News and the progress of the alien invasion. This adds to the tension and quite cleverly tells the story of what is happening outside the house. The acting is not brilliant and Mel Gibson struggles to decide if he is going put on a serious face or a comical face. Sometimes in movies he plays his parts as if he is always in a Leathal Weapon film. But all in all this is a very good film. 8 out of 10.,Signs
131,gbheron,Shyamalan Scores Again,8,8 February 2003,"M. Night Shyamalan takes on alien invasion in ""Signs"". But Night's approach takes a very different tack than most invasion flicks such as ""Independence Day"" by telling his story from the perspective of a rural American family who has somehow has found themselves in the middle of the alien's planning process. You've got to suspend disbelief and not be too analytical about the plot, since an apparent key to the alien's invasion scheme is crop circles. And that is what Graham Hess (Gibson) finds in his backyard cornfield one day. He shares his farmhouse with his son (R. Culkin) and his younger brother (Phoenix). Recently widowed through an auto accident, Graham, previously the town's pastor is now a bitter disbeliever. That is until the aliens show up in the neighborhood.I saw ""Signs"" at the tail end of its theatrical release and so had read reviews about how the invasion story was not the central theme. Many reviewers posited that the primary story dealt with miracles, coincidence, and the existence of God.  That's too deep for me. I found ""Signs"" a very unique approach to the alien invasion story and was surprised at how creepy the movie actually is. The acting and directing are very good (we expect nothing less from a Shyamalan), the plot, although implausible, carries the viewer through the sometimes terrifying ordeal of a family on the periphery of the biggest event in the history of mankind. Highly recommended.",Signs
132,jon.h.ochiai,Signs by design,9,7 August 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" was totally unexpected, not with respect to the ending, but rather for it's funny and quirky style in the midst of a story structured for great apprehension and fear of the unknown. Ultimately Shyamalan has created a parable about the nature of faith, and that things happen by design. The fact the Shyamalan does all this in one movie is an amazing accomplishment. Mel Gibson is a Graham Hess, who is a farmer in town in Pennsylvania. He has two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). We soon learn that Graham was an Episcopal priest, who left when his wife was killed in an accident. Also Graham's brother, Merrill, is also living on the farm helping him out with his kids. One of the Signs appears in Graham's corn fields. They are the kind we saw in the 1970's that were supposedly used my ancient astronauts (i.e. aliens) to navigate earth. Strange things are happening. Dogs are going crazy. Bo says that her glasses of water taste funny. Soon after spaceships appear all over the world-- all on TV. Do they come in peace? Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances. As Graham he is suffering, and not only has he lost his faith, but even has it that God has betrayed him. There is an awesome scene in the movie where Graham and Merrill are watching new reports of the spaceships. Graham says that there are two camps when it comes to ""signs"": one group sees the wonder of it, because they believe in something by design, the other fears the end of the world, because they see that they are ultimate all alone. Both are generated. And Graham falls in the latter. Gibson's character is struggling, and he makes his plight so noble and human. This makes the movie worth watching. The interesting thing about ""Signs"" is that along with the tension and apprehension created for the possible aliens, it is not really that necessary to the story. And this actually makes ""Signs"" special, because it is really about Graham's life and his family. Shyamalan surprises us in the end in a paradoxical way, in terms of our expectations. It is satisfying and honors the integrity of the characters he made us care about, particularly Gibson's Graham. ""Signs"" is a very good movie.",Signs
133,DarthBill,You'll either love it or you'll hate it,3,9 April 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan seems to have a knack for writing and directing both bizarre films and offering actors who's careers may or may not be a stalling a chance to give new and interesting characterizations.
Exit Bruce Willis, enter Mel Gibson. Mel's played the larger than life hero so many times we've almost forgotten films like ""Tim"" and ""Man Without A Face"". So naturally he tackled this film in hopes of reminding people that there's more to him than just Mad Max, Martin Riggs and all those other tough guys.Mel plays a down and out widower reverend who's all cut off from his kids and has a live in brother played by Joaquim Phoenix. When all sorts of weird things start happening like crazy dogs and crop circles, the logical explanation is of course, aliens.It's not quite successful though.

Opinions may differ on the moment he completely lost it, although Lady in the Water is generally regarded as the point his hubris got the better of him.Like The Village, Signs belongs to a middle Shyamalan phase, where his visual talent still made up for his limits (preachiness, plot holes, the egotistic insistence of casting himself in pivotal roles).Signs follows an alien invasion from the point of view of a small rural family including a widowed father (Mel Gibson), his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and two kids. The movie is filmed with style, intelligence and an unusual attention to silence and stillness in the build-up of atmosphere.The elephant in the room is, of course, a plot hole so conspicuous it has achieved memetic status, with the water-allergic invaders mastering interstellar travel but not raincoats and umbrellas. Why don't you just commit yourself to directing and leave screenplays to better writers and acting to actors, Night?

I did my part.That's it.  I'm giving up on this director.  It's not that I expect every one of his movies to deliver the same payload that ""The Sixth Sense"" did; but I expect him to deliver *something*.This movie was a....well, I was about to say ""a mess"", but that's not it. It was just plain insipid.  A stupid failure on many fronts.*** spoilers ***I was very curious about and full of anticipation for the resolution on the early characterization of the emotionally closed family.  I guess the dinner table crying scene was supposed to be that resolution.  Or something.  But it didn't get resolved in a satisfactory manner.The aliens were stupid.  The film was like a couple of neighborhood kids making an alien movie during their summer break, except their neighborhood is Palos Verdes, and they have millions in their budget.  ""OK, let's make 'em *reeeeel* creepy, y'know!  Like, with big; I mean really *BIG* gross fingernails!  Yeah!  And they have to have reeeeeally scary teeth!  Yeah, like, and like, they don't have toothpaste on the planet they come from!"" In the larger view, the aliens were like a weird carbuncle on the hiney of this movie.  I did not see the point of even having aliens in this movie, except it was not impossible to dovetail them into the clumsy skeinwork of the plot.The dialog gives new depth and meaning to the term ""wooden.""  And I do mean that; it's not wooden in the normal sense.  Maybe the correct descriptor is ""waxy;"" like dialog that wax museum dummies might exchange.  It's unremittingly and interminably clever, seeking to find it's trenchancy within seconds of expression, vs. laying back a bit and contributing to the building up of a powerful scenario or storyline.  The few places where cross references happen (e.g., Mel's wife's last dying words and the alien confrontation scene) are so contrived and cheap you can see the duct tape holding the plot together.The sad thing about a movie like this is that its failure is obvious.  You could plainly see that the director was trying to say something about the power of the spiritual; and he failed.  He tried to say something about providential reasons for accepting individual quirks and seeming flaws in the people around us; and maybe only delivered on a dimly intellectual level.  He tried to say something about the positive impact of adversity on our deeper selves; and dropped the ball.  When, at the end, I saw Gibson dressing up in his collar to do his priestly rounds again, I could see why this was supposed to make sense from the standpoint of the director's good intentions, but shook my head that this movie simply failed to bring so many of us along for that ride.I guess I've said enough.  Someone pull the plug on the Shyamalan juggernaut, please.Thanks for reading.  I'll go now.",Signs
136,Rogue-32,A little too much corn in those fields?,7,5 August 2002,"While not as breathtaking as The Sixth Sense (with its goosebump-inducing-no-matter-how-many-times-I-see-it surprise ending) nor as majestic as Unbreakable (with its unique believe-it-if-you-dare reality), Signs is still an M. Night Shyamalan film, which means it will not bore you, at least.  There are great performances as well: Mel Gibson conveys profound sadness with incredible subtlety, Joaquin Phoenix permeates his every scene with complexity, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin  have no false moves, thanks to Shyamalan's superb direction, particularly with children.
So we have a potentially brilliant film that doesn't quite pay off at the end (which in any other filmmaker's hands would most likely have been downright corny).  I do, however,  appreciate Shyamalan's attempt to depict a very tricky subject - the 'mysterious ways' of divine guidance, the lack of coincidence in events that seemingly appear disconnected, which come together when they're meant to, in order to make what is supposed to happen occur.  For that alone, I give him the thumbs-up sign.",Signs
137,itamarscomix,Bloody awful,3,24 May 2005,"I didn't have very high expectations for Signs. I didn't expect it to be this bad, either.What did we have here, then? Terribly unconvincing acting by Mr. Mel Gibson, one of the worst performances he's ever turned out. But what can you expect from him with this kind of script? His character is a two-dimensional mess. A widower reverend, who saves the world from aliens. That's about it. There's no real connection. And if you tell me the movie isn't really about aliens but about faith and Christian love and whatnot, I'll tell you plainly to shut up. It's a sci-fi movie, and it's bad sci-fi. If you consider it as a family movie it's even worse. Joaquin Phoenix, remembered fondly from Gladiator and Buffalo Soldiers, is wasted. And the kids were even more irritatingly cute than Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense - if that's possible. We got mediocre directing (not up to M. Night Shyamalan's standards), bloody awful writing. Shyamalan's dialogue was always bad, but the stories were great. This time we have a story that is not much more than a remake of War of the Worlds. This movie was made dozens of times before. The fact that Phoenix mutters 'It's like War of the Worlds' (oh, how self conscious) doesn't make it a parody or a homage. It's still a rip-off. Mars Attacks was a parody; Signs is a rip-off. The film doesn't excuse itself by using higher standards of special effects than were available before - the aliens look so awfully digital it's just pathetic.And the thing that bothered me worst is this. Watching a Shyamalan film, my expectations low though they were, I knew that as bad as the script will be, I'll still get a lovely, surprising twist ending. Well, there was a surprise. Here's the twist: there's no surprise. The ending is obvious and cheesy as hell. Maybe that's meant to be the surprise - if it is, it's a very tasteless joke. Sorry. The corny love-thy-neighbor-and-god-and-believe-in-yourself messages at the end don't impress me much either. Signs told me nothing I didn't already know. Look, I know all about crop circles, right? I kept hoping for a surprising explanation for the phenomena at the end of the film. Well, here's the explanation - they were created by thin, ugly, green aliens who want to take over the Earth, who look surprisingly like the guys from Close Encounters. WOAH! That was so never done before! Hey, hope you don't mind the spoiler. I consider it more a fair warning to prevent you from completely wasting two hours of your life. If you're a sucker for trick endings and consider watching the film because you liked Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, stay clear.",Signs

139,swilliky,A haunting alien invasion story,7,21 January 2017,"M. Night Shyamalan takes on aliens in his third big picture. Reverend Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) wakes up to find his crops bent into a strange pattern and his dogs acting overly aggressive. His two children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) are forced to kill one of the dogs that tries to attack them. Graham also lives with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) who used to be a baseball star but had issues striking out too much and gave up the career.The mysterious signs increased steadily in another slow burn. The Hess family keeps seeing and hearing disturbing figures moving around their crops but can never seem to catch them. Meanwhile, other residents report strange sightings and Officer Paski (Cherry Jones) notices odd behavior from visitors. Eventually, the news coverage shows that aliens have arrived in spaceships that hover over Mexico City, then other major cities across the world.

140,jrarichards,(Double) storytelling at the level of immaculate genius,10,20 February 2016,"The Shyamalan ""not quite what it seems to be"" film par excellence, and excellence is indeed on show here. There is a huge matter of import to be conveyed by the film, and every scene from start to finish contributes smoothly and richly to that overall effect, whether it be a subtle or overt one, eccentric, scary, engaging, humorous or deeply moving (and all of these states of mind and emotion are to be found in abundance). Furthermore, every cast member from youngest to oldest seems to display conviction, an unusual and tangible awareness that what they have to do in the film will help add up to something amazing.A taut alien invasion story is told here in minimalist, no-waste fashion, at first hand through the experiences of small-town, Corn Belt America, and more globally through sparing use of the old TV broadcast dodge; but there is also a wider battle for the soul and spirit of the film's chief hero, Graham Hess, portrayed by Mel Gibson. Interestingly, then, it is not the Gibson performance that stands out most (fine though it is), but those of supporting cast Joaquin Phoenix (as Graham's live-in younger brother Merill), Shyamalan himself, Rory Culkin (as the son of the family), and my personal favourite, Cherry Jones as Officer Caroline Paski, who contributes far, far more than her number of lines might suggest.Perhaps it matters little whether we can or cannot accept that the painful, stupid or trivial things all around us might add up to more than the sum of their parts. It is enough that someone is bold enough to produce a piece of true art in which that possibility is taken so fully and so beautifully to its logical limits. It is a fine and wondrous thing to behold.It seems unlikely that anyone who wanted to has yet to see this film, and it is clear that not everybody ""sees"" it when they see it, as it were. Equally, there may be some people out there still labouring under the misapprehension that this is just sci fi (assuming of course that any sci fi is ""just sci fi""). But given how any true science fiction fan will have to regard a plot twist about the alien's unpleasant experiences on Earth as ludicrous, that merely goes to demonstrate that alien invasion is not the film's primary purpose, and that nothing in this world can be quite perfect. Nevertheless, for this reviewer, this in some ways modest offering ought surely to rank as one of history's finest ever films. And yes, I really do mean it!",Signs
141,afonsobritofalves,"A good film, which does not have the reputation it deserves.",9,10 July 2020,"Signs is a film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and, despite being one of the science fiction films with lower reviews, I think this is without a doubt one of the best films about extraterrestrial life ever made.First of all, I want to mention that the cast of this film is fantastic, with the participation of Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix, who do a fantastic job in interpreting these characters.As for the film's argument, I think it's very good. The film tells the story of a family whose mother died some time ago and that is still recovering from the loss and that, from one moment to the next, they need to survive an extraterrestrial invasion.When it comes to character development, this film is perfect, for example, in the opening scene, where we see Graham Hess (played by Mel Gibson) waking up at night, in just a minute we know everything about the character through what we can see in his room, and this is a fantastic way to meet a new character, but the most important thing we learn about him is that he used to be a priest until his wife died, when she died, he lost his faith; we do not know for sure what happened to the faith of Graham's brother (played by Joaquim Phoenix), and his daughter, but we do know that his son Morgan did not lose his faith, thus leaving a small contrast between father and son.During the film, the family becomes aware of several signs that are being left around the world, including on their farm, how the animals are panicking and the famous ""signs"" in the grass that can be seen from the sky are some of them. Over time, several strange beings begin to be seen, thus causing many scenes of thriller and suspanse. Most people look at these beings as if they were evil beings who just want to kill human beings, but that is not the message of the film, this film is not like Alien or Independence Day! If we analyze this film well, the aliens are not here to kill or kidnap us, they are here because they are desperate, because they are panicking! We are not told why, but we can see that these aliens are also scared of humans, it is not only humans who are afraid of them, which would explain the signs before the apparitions, which would explain why they did not know they had the weakness of the water and what explains why they don't kill anyone (although it looks like they're going to do it sometimes).But the movie Signs is not a Horror or Suspanse film, it is a film that goes much further than attacks by aliens, it is a film that talks about faith, and how a person can lose it and win it! It is a film that talks about relationships between parents and children and between siblings, especially in moments of tension and in situations of contrast!As for more technical levels, the film has a good directing, the clothes used are good and the script is fabulous, with a great casting.To sum up, if someone goes to see the movie Signs with an expectation that they will see a movie like Alien or Predator they will regret it, but if they are expecting to see a movie as I described above, they will have a fantastic time! And I think that's why most people didn't like the movie.I also think it's important to remember that this was the film that introduced a lot of new things to the cinema, like the pyramid-shaped aluminum paper hats and the tall grass signs seen from the sky.The film is very good, but it cannot be compared with other films much better, therefore I will evaluate it with 9/10.",Signs
142,Maziun,People who believe and the ones who don't believe,7,30 November 2013,"""Signs"" is a movie that divided people even more than great and underrated ""Unbreakable"". It isn't a ""War of the worlds "" or ""Independence day"" type of movie . It isn't really about alien invasion. It's about faith and losing it . The aliens are only catalyst for that theme. It's a movie about human condition.The idea of making a serious movie about faith based on aliens and crop circle in plantation is very risky . I think that while not everything worked in the end , Shyamalan actually comes victorious . ""Signs"" does fall apart in the end . The logical questions about aliens that audience have aren't answered and the final twist is rather laughable. Still as a drama it succeeds. Shyamalan leads his heroes masterfully. We really care about them and can imagine ourselves in their situation. Shyamalan never fails to create suspense too. There is a great tension here and some of the scenes are really scary . Why ? Because Shyamalan wonderfully plays with viewers imagination and he knows that what you don't see is what scares the most.James Newton Howard's score is great , while Tak Fujimoto's photography is sublime. Good performances from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix.I'm hoping that Shyamalan will be able to make once again a good movie. It would be shame for such good director to end his career too soon. I'm still waiting and hoping for his comeback. I give it 7/10.",Signs
143,Jack the Ripper1888,Great thriller!,10,8 August 2002,"The newest film in the legacy of M. Night Shyamalan, SIGNS manages to pull off some very effective creepiness in the very beginning and also holds your interesting throughout the course of the film. Mel Gibson is great, aswell as Joaquin Phoenix. The film was very creepy and contains steadily mounting terror. Vaguely similar to Mark Pellington's THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.The film is scary and in some cases, disturbing. The aliens are very well designed. The film actually surprised me. I was not expecting Shyamalan to stick with the story so very closely throughout the entire film almost. With his earlier works, THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE, he focuses on the relationships between family members very closely to create a lot of drama that has a payoff. But, most of this film is taken up by fast-moving situations that involve alien activity and crop circles. My only complaint, and I mean 'only', is that the film tries way too hard to be funny. It tries much harder than Shyamalan's earlier works and is the type of humor that is not 'laugh-out-loud', but it is funny because you were not expecting it in a sci-fi suspense thriller. The sequences of the film that are scary, ARE scary. They could have been a little more effectively done, but otherwise, they were very well-crafted. SIGNS is a great movie that will live in movie history forever in both the genres of thriller and sci-fi. SIGNS gets 5/5.",Signs
144,Atreyu_II,Generally good... until the ending which ruins it a little,7,12 January 2008,"In my opinion, ""Signs"" is an okay movie, entertaining enough and has a good level of tension, suspense and thriller, as well as a reasonably dramatic story. But it isn't much more than just an okay piece of entertainment.At my point of view, most of the climax of the movie is during nearly the entire film, because we don't really know how the ET's look like until almost the ending. When the ET's finally appear, it's a major disappointment, because they're so ugly, badly designed and they even look green-like (as if they were wearing military or war clothes)! This is mostly what makes me rate this movie a bit lower, although, to be fair, fortunately the ET's appearance is short.If you ask me, they should have created these ET's more carefully, like Steven Spielberg did in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"".Mel Gibson proves once again to be a good dramatic actor, portraying an ex-priest (or Father) who has lost his faith... until he recovers it at the end.Besides the tension, thriller, suspense and drama, I also like very much those giant crop circles made by the aliens. No doubt that they were perfectly made. Really very well made. Apparently not even a human hand could do crop circles this fine.Overall, a reasonable movie, but the same director (M. Night Shyamalan) has a much better movie than this: ""The Sixth Sense"", his most popular and most praised movie all over the world.",Signs
145,Pedro_H,Good production values but no originality and little vitality.,6,8 February 2004,"Crop circles appear in a farmers field, but are they the work of aliens or practical jokers?The very mention of crop circles as a plot device sends shivers down my spine. Everyone knows they are made by sad people with planks of wood working in the middle of the night. That is apart from the simple circles that are caused by freak mini whirlwinds. Here we are expected to throw away such knowledge and start down the route of ""maybe, just maybe.""Mel Gibson plays an ex-priest turned farmer who has lost his faith after the tragic death of his wife (oh flashing lights and heavenly choruses - will this come in to play later in the film!?). He lives on his semi-isolated farm with his two children and his brother and seems to have an ideal rural life before he becomes bothered by night time invaders who don't seem to be able to be caught.At several points this film fails to make any sense. This is America and better still an American farm and yet no guns are available. Equally this is a story where the real story is elsewhere, broadcast on TV and only partly explained. While not wanting to take on any film that goes down any route in telling a story - if you want to tell a story about ""overcoming"" then there are many routes. Why this one?What can you say without being a spoiler? Very little. If you have seen Close Encounters, War of the Worlds and The Birds then you will get the general idea of what the film is about. Although all the above films are good, I don't rate any of them as being classic because they are such simple plot devices that only work by expensive special effects.Here we have cheap special effects of the ""rattling doorknob"" variety that almost bring to mind a cheap Hammer horror film. There is, sadly, nothing new to offer just a lot of something-is-about-to-happen that, bizarrely, even the actors don't seem to be taking seriously!(Although how people act under real stress might well seem silly - so maybe I have to qualify that.)There is nothing really wrong with the film in terms of acting or production, but we have been here before. The director (Shyamalan) needs a bit of help - he is taking on too much himself. Taking an acting role in this film is by far the biggest mistake. He created a modern classic in the Sixth Sense, but - on the evidence here - he is running out of ideas fast and merely forming greatest hits tapes from other people's movies.",Signs
146,rebeljenn,"two stories, one conclusion",3,13 May 2006,"'Signs' is a film about a widowed father and minister from rural America. The film combines two stories: one of the father and his ability to deal with his wife's death while making sense of the alien invasion through the eyes of his religion. The other story is more science-fiction in nature with people hiding in horror as they try to overcome the aliens and protect themselves. The film has some lessons to learn and settles the story in a way that encompasses both plots together nicely. The family-life plot was a little too slow moving for me, and it felt forced and silly/patriotic/sympathetic. It humanized the main character too much, and it distracted from the science-fiction part of the film. Special effects were also done well and were believable. The aliens did look frightening, and showing less in some instances was more because it made the story seem even more frightening and realistic.",Signs

Yes the acting was good by the main cast starring Mel Gibson And Jouqin Pheonix but the side cast were terrible. This movie had a high budget but it was shot in about 3 small different places? I have no idea where all the money went.This movie is about an ex reverend who owns a farm. One day after his children were screaming in the fields he runs out to discover crop cirlces. Then they turn on the news and see that something very strange is happening as crop cirlces start to pop up all over the world.

Very disappointing, over-sentimental and maudlin to the max, the plot (?) is fraught with improbable, silly notions of prophecy, predation and predestination.  Aliens are coming to earth to ""harvest"" us humans.  They're running around naked, they've the technology to come through the galaxy but are unable to get out of a locked closet (forgive me, pantry), they squirt poison gas and leave crop circles as landing sites.This is the same Mel Gibson who gave us Braveheart, Mad Max and Gallipoli.

150,AhmedSpielberg99,Brilliant!,8,5 August 2019,"I have never been a big fan of Shyamalan's arguable masterwork, The Sixth Sense. Simply, because it leans heavily on its plot-twist, which I figured out from the first 5 minutes of the film. However, this was my only major issue with the entire film. Almost every single aspect of that film worked for me. I loved its uniquely warm atmosphere that boosts everything in the film: from the drama to the horror. I can say that Signs shares most of The Sixth Sense's merits.From the way of building suspense to the somewhat cheesy melodrama that works perfectly to tackling themes of parental fear and invulnerability, It's safe to assume that Shyamalan has been immensely influenced by Spielberg's films. And all that Shyamalan excels at in this film.What makes Signs different from similar Alien contact films at its time is its philosophical question it addresses, its commentary on faith and the moral dilemma the protagonist faces. I would be lying if I said that the philosophy is well woven into the plot: Shyamalan really has went too far here! As a result, the dialogue can be occasionally off-putting and the questions the film poses will definitely feel muddled.However, as a consequence, the characters (especially the protagonist Graham Hess, played by Mel Gibson) are quite well-developed and multi-layered. What is even more impressive is how our main characters' vulnerabilities shape the aliens. Through brilliant use of foreshadowing and flash-backs throughout the film, I couldn't help being dazzled by the complete picture at the end.Speaking of the end, there's no need to talk about the notorious implausible plot-twist that also, unfortunately, happens to be the film's major plot-hole. Nevertheless, I think it can be swallowed with the help of a glass of water! 😂Overall, I believe that Signs is an evidence that Shyamalan once had a great potential to become one of the best directors of modern thrillers and mysteries. Split revived this potential, but Glass broke it (I feel) for good.(8/10)",Signs

And, if you were wondering, it doesn't have any really scary scenes in it. But then again, it's more about the faith and family of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Graham is this priest, who has lost his faith after his wife had died in a car accident. Now he's living with his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). One day huge crop circles appear on their field. Then they notice that strange things start to happen all around the world.Signs relies much on slow narration and it's own quirky atmosphere. There are TV reports shown all over the movie, which work as testimonials of the truthfulness of the situation, it's not in their imagination.Well, in all, I cannot recommend this movie, if you want fast scares or lots of action. But if you like slower narration and not so obvious plot line this is for you.",Signs

I also understand that the ""crop circle/alien"" aspect of the film was simply a tool to simultaneously get people in the seats and test the faith of the story's characters.  But does that mean that all of the gaping plot holes involving the aliens (which I will not list here because so many other posts already have pointed them out) should be forgiven?  Of course not. Regardless of the director's motives regarding the aliens, this is still bad movie making.  There are also many plot holes involving the family (which have also been listed ad nauseum).  Plot holes aside, it's still just a flat out lousy movie.  Shyamalan takes himself and his stories way too seriously.  He thinks way too highly of himself.  He wants to be the greatest director of this generation, a hybrid master somewhere between Spielbergian sentimentality and Hitchcockian thrills.  He also seems to be repeating himself already with his past three films in trying to perfect a new genre--the tear-jerk thriller.  I think Shyamalan is capable of making good movies.  ""The Sixth Sense"" was a decent, well crafted, well acted film, although not nearly as great as many propose. He can also make interesting films.  ""Unbreakable"" was probably the only film where I was totally enthralled by the first hour or so, and then flat out hated the film by the last half hour.  ""Signs"" could have been a decent B-movie (even if it was still about faith and family) but Shyamalan approached the material far too reverently, as did all the actors.  Just because a movie is about faith doesn't mean it is good, or even well intentioned.  Again, with his supposed twist of an ending (and what a wretched ending this movie had), Shyamalan seems to think every movie has to have a twist (and a moral).  ""Sixth Sense"" had a good and appropriate twist. ""Unbreakable"" had an appalling and ridiculous twist (ewww...it was actually a comic book movie BOOO HISSSSSSS) and ""Signs"" has a completely inept and unnecessary twist, that really isn't a twist at all.  In fact, this really wasn't a movie at all.  This movie was neither scary nor touching, nor well made nor well intentioned.

M. Night is a really great director!  The story moves along quite well and leave you hanging on every word and every scene.  M. Night also seems to be really good at the comedy aspect as well.The actors in this film do a great job.  Mel Gibson is great as always and Joaquin Phoenix just gets better and better as an actor.  Rory Culkin (another Culkin brother) does a really good job as well.  ...And I mustn't forget Abigail Breslin.  What a cute little girl!  She has numerous cute scenes throughout the film, and she's a REALLY good little actress.  I'll definitely be keeping my eyes open for her future work.I would hope that if you liked ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" then you will like this film.  But I can't stress enough how much you need to not think of this movie as a sci-fi movie.  It's much more of a thriller / thought-provoking movie, rather than sci-fi.  Anyhow, just don't get your hopes up.  I truly hope that you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-ChrisP.S. Can't wait for M. Night's next work!!!",Signs
158,Antagonisten,Roller-coaster,5,18 January 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan seems to be like a train. While he does move on in a steady pace, he doesn't leave the track. Prestenly he has directed four films that are very similar in style, the last of these ""The Village"".Graham Hess is a farmer who suddenly discovers huge crop circles in his corn fields. What do these mean? Signs from above? But from who and why? Graham is about to find out along with the rest of humanity.My summary above was ""roller-coaster"". And why? Because ""Signs"" is like a roller-coaster ride? Not really, what i meant was rather that this movie displays an astonishing spectrum of quality. From very good and solid scenes to some elements that are pure garbage. It's very ""up and down"" you might say. There are two things that i found very disturbing about this movie. First of all the ending (or rather the resolution), which i won't discuss in detail since it would mean spoilers. But one thing to think about is this: if you were an omnipotent being, how hard would it be for you to force your way through a wooden door?! The second thing is Mel Gibson. I don't know what it is about that man. Sometimes he can be great, and sometimes he degrades his acting talent to the level of Christopher Lambert! His attempts at emotional displays here are pathetic to say the least.With that said this movie has a few strong points that makes it worth watching nevertheless. First of all the almost patented atmosphere of suspense that Shyamalan always manages to create. The effective mood of something bad about to happen. Also the story works pretty well despite some flaws. What i also appreciate is the rather quirky sense of humor that Shyamalan displays in this movie. Some people have interpreted this as the director making fun of his own movie. But rather i see it as his way of not making the movie grave and serious to the point where everything becomes silly.So, i recommend this to fans of Shyamalan and fans of suspenseful thrillers. But i also raise a flag of warning about Mel Gibson. If you didn't like Mel Gibson to begin with, you will loathe him here. I rate it 5/10.",Signs
159,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: sub-intellectual and awful in every way,3,25 August 2002,"Signs is a sci-fi horror flick which is neither scientific nor horrific. Despite the good acting and high production value, the plot is not particularly engaging, and surprisingly, not scary either.That would be bad enough, but unfortunately, there are major problems with the aliens, who are not menacing at all. They refuse to break through closed doors. They don't even fight hand-to-hand, probably because they are computer generated. So... what about all that high technology?Lots about the film just doesn't make sense in the above manner. It's even worse than ""Independence Day"", and the religious overtones have been out of place in sci-films since, oh, the 1950s.Who should see this film:-- nobody, even if you think you might want toI'll give Signs a revolting 3 out of 10.",Signs

161,Rickting,"Despite the backlash, M Night Shyamalan's last good film still holds up",7,13 December 2014,"Before the days of a 19th century village doing their best Kristen Stewart impersonations, bizarre self indulgent bedtime stories, Mark Wahlberg talking to plants, air karate and planet nepotism, Shyamalan made 3 strong genre efforts which took genres (Ghost story, superhero, alien invasion) known for thrills and turned them into quieter, deft character pieces. It's the same with Signs. This is the last time he made a good film, although it's not as good as Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense. Signs has received some backlash following its release, but it's a flawed yet interesting work overall. It's an alien invasion seen through the eyes of a family who lives on a farm, and there are various Religious themes as well which make the story deeper than it would otherwise have been. Shyamalan's script has its ups and downs. There are some silly and awkward lines which provoke face palms while other parts of the script are more interesting. The performances are mostly OK, and Mel Gibson just about pulls it off.The film is less credible since it has a plot hole big enough to fly a UFO through: Why do aliens who are susceptible to water come to a planet where two thirds of it are lethal to them? This certainly lets the film down combined with the uneven script and lack of action, which can feel slightly disappointing. Shyamalan pretty much ditches a finale and the thrilling moments and small scale. This is a good thing overall, but a little more of a climax wouldn't have hurt. However, the Religious elements will divide people but for me they added unforeseen emotion to the storyline, and the film oozes suspense in every frame. With astonishing visuals and cinematography, the film certainly looks great and even if the suspense doesn't amount to all that much, the way it is maintained throughout the film is pretty extraordinary. It doesn't have the best storyline ever, but it's a memorable alien invasion flick a definitely worth a look. Any alien attack film which is brave enough to avoid a massive shoot out space battle deserves credit.7/10",Signs
162,Nightman85,The best thriller of 2002 and Shyamalan's masterpiece!,10,29 June 2006,"Terrific in every way, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs is one of the most thought provoking thrillers of our time and Shyamalan's greatest work!When a Pennsylvania family discovers crop circles (among other weird occurrences) on their farm, they begin to believe that Earth is about to have some hostile visitors from above!With Shyamalan's stylish direction, an excellent cast, and an engulfing story that's both suspenseful and touching, Signs becomes one of the most beautifully done thrillers in many ages. Shyamalan is at his best as he captures the power of his intriguing tale both cinematically and emotionally well. He gives us a story with lovable, sympathetic characters who come into an extraordinary and terrifying situation, needless to say it's a captivating story from start to finish. It also possesses lots of color, as Shyamalan throws in plenty of tension, thrills, humor, and deeply stirring scenes. James Newton Howard provides a lovely music score for the film that is scene-by-scene perfect.The cast is a true highlight as well. The always-excellent Mel Gibson is strong as a reverend who is losing his faith following the loss of his wife. Joaquin Phoenix does well as Gibson's bewildered brother. Young Rory Culkin is great as Gibson's son and adorable Abigail Breslin is splendid as the daughter.A truly wonderful film on all levels, Signs is a film that will be enjoyed by all, not just fans of thriller genre. Even those who don't care for Shyamalan's earlier pictures may be surprised by this gem. It's well worth seeing more than once!**** out of ****",Signs
163,Spanner-2,Very good until the ending.,7,12 August 2002,"This latest thriller is from director M. Night Shyalmanan and has many of his trademark touches. This story is basicaly ""Independance Day"" old from the perspective of an isolated farmhouse.. you get all the old standby alien invasion angles, but you are so cut off from the main story and forced to focus on this one family that it gets scarier by implication. The atmospheric touches and the total absence of underscore for much of the film add to the fear and suspense factor that ratchets up till the end of the world scenerio plays itself out. Mel Gibson as an emotionaly damaged former preacher and father of two young children is good in an underplayed role as is Joaquin Phoenix as his former minor-league ballplayer brother. The film is good for long stretches before finaly falling apart at the end and failing to live up to it's expectations. GRADE: B",Signs

This is a very average film that is boring and predictable and it is absurd in its entirety, not to mention that the director (who is incredulous in the film) can not handle the basic premise of logic. The inconsistent themes which play out are laughble, considering that a whole film is wasted on the pseudo-intellectualizing of a man who has lost his faith and regained it because of an alien invasion (was the script written by a 14 year old). Most of the film takes place on some small farm in Iowa that is attacked by plastic looking aliens which are latter computerized and hillarious. Avoid after first viewing. Grade: C.",Signs

Yes, his character does have good reason to be bitter, but you never see any tenderness at all from him. He gives no comforting words when something bad happens to the kids, and we don't see him doing any general dad things. In fact, each time his kids try to do something, he treats them like they're an annoyance or idiots. Below average child performances don't make this any better. We also never learn anything at all about Phoenix's character other than he used to play baseball.

170,bsinc,Phenomenal,8,22 December 2003,"What to say about a movie that changed my life? And to lean on Travolta's character from Swordfish - ""I'm not some grungy wannabe filmmaker searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke or something."" But realizing the message of this movie was profoundly enlightening! ""Signs"" is a most felicitous mixture of hidden symbols and meanings. It goes way past other such movies because mr. Shyamalan has the utmost sense of perfection in his editing, musical score, scenery, photography, dialogues and especially actors and actresses. His movies are constantly feeding the viewer, but not stuffing them, he knows very well when to let the viewer figure and realize things out for himself. As characteristic for both ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" he provides an amazing revelation at the very end, and it left me with goose bumps till the closing credits. When I put the puzzle together it was simply magical, as if the world was an enormous map, I just had to look around and read it. The execution was yet again flawless and faultless but I do think that the initial idea of signs should have been realized in a non alien manner, which would probably make it as timeless as ""The Sixth Sense"". But I do find it most entertaining and annoying when I read comments about the movie and see that half the people didn't even get it, they just didn't like the alien CG and get all mad because they think the movie sucked. Well, in my mind the aliens were so crudely made because they were not even the main part of the story, they just began turning the wheels of the movie. As for the message the movie gives, well, I guess it just isn't for everybody. Just for those of us who can read Signs.  8/10",Signs
171,Flagrant-Baronessa,Well-composed but the sloppy ending and illogic are unforgivable,6,19 July 2006,"M. Night Shylmalan is excellent in one, and ONLY one, area of film-making  namely in establishing a tense mood in his films. This is done throughout Signs just like it is done in The Sixth Sense and in Unbreakable. There is a certain slow and suspenseful pace achieved through devices such as visuals and score that builds up great tension in these films and this is indeed hard to rival, and for that, Mr. Shylmalan deserves some credit. At everything else, however, he is simply not that good at.This is, you guessed it, another suspenseful mystery thriller with a twist or two  this time with sci-fi elements. It is the story of crop circles outside a family's home in Pennsylvania and all that these bring with them. If you disregard the fact that these crop circles had in reality been exposed as a sham well before this film was made, then Signs makes them seem pretty scary. Again, the mood and build-up are paid great detail to and this will definitely keep your attention unless you have ADHD. Some visuals from Signs have remained with me, like the first time Joaquin Phoenix's character is watching the news in the closet and it shows footage of one of the aliens, captured at a birthday party in Mexico. The moment the alien walks pastand it is not even a momentis one of the scariest visuals I can think of.My problem with Signs is that Shylmalan is convinced that any ""mystic"" idea that pops into his head will automatically translate into a compelling mystery story on screen. He is so convinced, in fact, that he goes to great lengths to invent his own absurd logic to facilitate his story. For example, what lead to the demise of the alien invasion: ""They're allergic to water"". Alright, so now we know. Except it's not POSSIBLE to inhabit earth for a minute without getting exposed to the water vapor in the air, or running through corn fields without getting the dew on the leaves of the cord. Seriously, they're allergic to WATER? This has to be one of the biggest cop-outs in film history.Because the resolution of Signs is so disappointing, it detracts from the otherwise suspenseful and well-crafted moods. No doubt the majority of the things in this film work quite well and this earns an above average rating - but the sloppy ending and its illogic are unforgivable. 6/10",Signs
172,PyrolyticCarbon,"Excellent suspenseful thriller, with an unnerving edge.",10,25 September 2002,"An excellent film from M. Night Shyamalan, once again. He even manages to show us more tricks and twists up his sleeve, although not so pivotal as Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, they are still there to be seen nonetheless.Mel Gibson is excellent in this movie, and you could so have seen Bruce Willis reliving his previous acting roles here. Joaquin Pheonix, whom I've always considered a great actor, shows me just why I thought that in a great supporting role. However, Rory Culkin didn't really hit the mark for me, but that was quickly forgotten.The plot is superb, and although huge in size, Shyamalan has decided to concentrate on a personal side to the story, a small family and how they are affected by strange events. I am going to try hard and say nothing about the story at all, for despite what all will say about there not being spoilers, if someone is telling you something about the film, then it is!I have never heard an audience scream or sigh relief before, not to this degree anyway, and I have not experienced such a feeling of uneasiness and nervousness in a movie for a very long time. By not showing you events, and choosing to concentrate on reactions and noises, you are spooked and on the edge of your seat much more than if you were just shown it.Everything is rounded and tied off perfectly, and there's such a feeling of having experienced a great movie. I find it hard to fault at all, with laughter coming right in the thick of moments of suspense and fear, and not missing a beat of the script, it shows what a great writer and director Shyamalan is.

174,dead47548,Has garnered very unnecessary hate.,8,21 April 2008,"As an alien invasion film, it fails. I just couldn't really get on board with the fact that they went into their basement, fell asleep, woke up the next day and it was all over among other things. However, as a character story of a man regaining his faith, it succeeds quite well. I'm not a religious person by any means, but I admired it nonetheless. In some aspects I did really enjoy seeing an epic alien invasion as portrayed through the eyes of a simple family with no huge explosions or battles or anything like that. It made it much more suspenseful and terrifying knowing that if the aliens actually did get to them they wouldn't have a shot of fighting their way out. As Joaquin Phoenix's Merrill says ""It's war of the worlds."" but instead of epic shots of explosions and alien technology, we see the fear and hopelessness of a single family.I love how slow-burning it was as well. It takes a while to get into the actual invasion, and all of the chaos on the news channels that we see just makes it a very exciting and suspenseful journey. I thought Shyamalan handled that very well. For instance, when Merrill sees the Brazilian video with the brief shot of one of the aliens, it shocked and intrigued myself just as it did him. However in bringing up the aliens, I have to say that they looked pretty ridiculous and just far too fake. It looked like something out of a playstation one game. I also wasn't too impressed by Shyamalan's attempts at humor in the film, aside from Joaquin Phoenix. It felt too cheesy and out of place. Some of the dialogue didn't go over so well with me, but most of it was good enough. Performance-wise, Phoenix is superb and Gibson falls pretty short for the most part. The kids are fine but nothing to write home about, and Shyamalan's brief appearance is laughable just like it is in all of his films.",Signs

Speaking of which, the Herrmann-esquire score by James Newton Howard is absolutely terrific, as it adds a sense of ominous thrill to each scene. The story was involving and scary, the acting was great all around, and the ending was a perfect fit.

And in ""the sixth sense"" I was really shocked at the end but in this the end was might not very expectable but I did not care about it.

Night Shymalan's Masterpiece, not Unbreakable, not even the Sixth Sense, Signs is not only one of my favorite movies of all time, but in my opinion it is one of the greatest thrillers ever made.It's a little slow, that is the only thing wrong with the movie, I will be discussing why the other problems people THINK are wrong with the movie later.The following does have spoilers. The acting is great, the characters are likable, the effects are minimal but well done, the message is subtle so that people don't feel like they are being preached at and being called morons for being Atheists. It has good undertones, it's is directed extremely well, it's scary at times, and the part that makes it way better than Unbreakble, it has a sense of humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously and lets you laugh quite a bit.Now for my rant about how people call the ending to this movie stupid. The ending reveals that the alien's poison is water, so why would this advanced alien race come to a planet that would kill them? 1. We don't know for sure the aliens did know that water was harmful to them. We are only given one small hint when Ray Reddy says that none of the circles are near water. Take into account how many crop circles vs. how many crop fields there are in the world. And they knew humans would be on land, so they would want to attack away from the water, where most people would be. Plus when the water does hit the alien near the end, he seems very surprised, almost like he didn't know.2. If they did know, they were probably desperate. They wanted to heard the humans, so they would do anything to get us. Hey, I hated science, but if there is one thing I did learn, enough water can kill us too.3. Ray said they didn't have them near water, so they obviously were taking precautions. They said the aliens were leaving by the next day, so they probably didn't want to stay that long knowing the air would eventually kill them.There, three reasons why the aliens would come to a planet filled with their toxic. But what about the fact that they couldn't get through a wooden door. Well, every door we saw them try to get through was blocked by something, ever try and get inside when a door is blocked, not easy. We even see them turn the door knob, so they obviously know how to get in.Why did God have to kill Graham's wife just so they would live through the alien encounter? You ever see Run Lola Run and realize how much one little thing you do can greatly effect your future. Imagine if his wife had lived. She only said swing away because she was delirious. Plus if she was alive, maybe they would have tried to leave and been killed. Maybe Merril wouldn't have come to stay with them and thus the whole family would have died. According to this movie, God knew exactly how to make sure the family lived through the ordeal. And taking his wife was part of the plan.And lastly, why does Graham not just rush Morgan to a hospital and instead rely on faith? Well, one, sometimes logic and reasoning don't make sense and faith is all you have left. If that's not good enough for you, the hospital was quite a bit away and there were probably hundreds of people there, Morgan might not have been able to get in. Plus Graham had good reason to believe he might be alright.Signs is a masterpiece.",Signs
179,PudgyPandaMan,I love the way the story unfolds from master storyteller Shyamalan,9,19 January 2009,"Unlike many modern movies that feel the need to spoon feed us info incessantly so that we ""get"" the movie (either with constant narrating or infantile dialogue) - this movie keeps us guessing as what exactly happened in the past to cause Graham to give up being a priest. I much prefer to have things unfold slowly and allow viewers to discover the facts for themselves.I think Shyamalan is a master of suspense, similar to Hitchcock, which happens to be one of his idols. This film has so much tension, and yet Shyamalan also allows for moments of comic relief to break up this tension as well. He pays Hitchcock several compliments by copying some of his trademarks - such as making a cameo appearance in the film (although he is a horrible actor. He should do non-speaking cameo's like Hitch). He also uses similar camera techniques like extremely close shots and unusual camera angles and perspectives. There's also a big similarity to Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" in the way that something is trying to get in the home and they have to board up all the doors and windows.Thia is one of the few ""scary"" movies I let my kids watch. It has no blood and gore like the ""slasher"" movies. It became an ongoing practical joke at my house where my husband would hide and make the alien ""clicking"" noise - and my kids would just roar with laughter. (of course they would never admit it ""scared"" them). I like that the film doesn't rely heavily on CGI or other special effects. It makes the film seem more realistic and believable, rather than the product of some big budget Hollywood production.I also like that the picture has a deeper meaning about whether we think we are alone, or believe that there are ""NO coincidences"".I think Gibson's performance was good, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix's was even better. His portrayal of ""akwardness"" and the failings in his life are so palpable and believable. He seems to be more a 3rd child in the film than Graham's adult counterpart. I absolutely love the scene where he joins the 2 kids on the sofa with the aluminum foil hats. We laughed hysterically. Abigail Breslin's performance was amazing given her very young age - and is a testament to the skilled direction of Shyamalan.In addition to some comic relief, there are some tender moments - like when Graham relays the story of the kids birth to them at a very tense moment. I had tears in my eyes at how delicately and intimately Gibson delivers these lines - you forget that he's reciting lines and truly believe what he's saying.I loved the music score - especially the opening credits. It has a chaotic and tense melody. I think the accompanying graphics were cool as well. But the music is a very crucial part in the building of suspense. And the movie gets off to a fast start with the little girl screaming and also sets the stage for a fast pace in the rest of the film.Word of warning - I have caught this on TV and it is guilty of cutting out key scenes (must be in order to fit in time slot because there is nothing inappropriate about the cut scenes).

Aside from the extremely slow movement (several scenes are needlessly drawn out, as though to ""stretch"" the plot) and the shoe string budget (Mel Gibson is the only major expenditure, as all 6 or 7 others appearing are unknowns), the ""coincidences"" presented are just a bit much to swallow. Each of at least 5 major story elements have odds of 10,000 to 1. Add them up, and every family member should have been struck by lightning AND won the State lottery!

It is not schlock, the violence and suspense are gripping and plausible, there's no 'silliness'. You commit to what is on screen almost immediately. M. Night Shyamalan (who has a small but pivotal role as well as writing and directing) is a genius of creativity. He doesn't spell the plot out for you as if you were stupid, as much American film/TV tends to, but a lot of background is outlined in the opening sequence before anyone has spoken a single word, just by paying attention. Informational conversation is realistic and whilst it informs the viewer it still makes sense in terms of the characters, so the viewer has to piece it together rather than being presented with it. Brilliant writing - can't praise that enough.Over all the film is fantastic, there's nothing that I can fault really. All performances are perfectly gaged; Mel Gibson is great, Joaquin Phoenix in perhaps my favourite role and he looks amazing ;-) and the two child actors Rory Culkin and the adorable Abigail Breslin were played naturally and just right. There are no massive bells and whistles in terms of big budget SFX, sets and contrivances, the film offers its 'kicks' on suspense and the less-is-more, almost for-the-stage, attitude to filming. It was filmed, by appearances, simply and often in the dark, using limited light to add tension. The musical score adds tremendous amounts of depth, drama and spook-factor and silence is used cleverly too. What builds a crescendo of dread is the narration given by television news reels, often on in the background, and that reporting adds realism to the plot:- You get a view of the outside world, and imagine what it would be like if anything like this happened. Some of the worst bits of the film are things you barely see but have you on the edge of your seat, just like Merrill (Phoenix) watching the TV, and you need to keep your wits about you if you are going to see all the connections as nothing is superfluous in this film it seems.The title, Signs, refers to the crop circles but also in the context of faith and belief, and the emotional roller-coaster in this film is based around Graham Hess' crisis of personal Faith and the element of predetermination or lack of coincidence in our everyday lives. It is both touching but also challenging, and as the film keeps you intimate with the action using up close shots and unusual focus on eyes, to draw you in, so you are brought to think about how you feel too as another onion layer. Whilst a very tense film, there are delightful smiles and laughs dotted throughout, and some moments of comedic laugh out loud genius (Phoenix has some great timing) and even having seen it before, it still doesn't fail to please, entertain and thrill on every level.",Signs
183,kgprophet,Jaded after too many DVD extras?,6,3 August 2002,"I have been digging all those DVD extras for a while now, and have fun learning about Mr. Shyalaman as a moviemaker. But it is nearly impossible now to relive that 'Sixth Sense moment'. Am I Jaded ? Have I become so immersed in the mechanics of movie-making that I can no longer let myself go and be swept away by a seductive movie such as Signs? I pick out the lapses in logic, or the unnecessary soap opera-ish subplots, and I become aware that I am watching a high profile gimmick and hype movie that is trying to hypnotize me. Instead, I found myself groaning about three different times. The minor league hero who couldn't make it in the big time. The father who tries to raise his kids without his mother, 'I want to stay here because this is where Mom used to live'. Then there is Mr. Shyamalan playing the guilt ridden neighbor. Once I saw him, I recognized him from being on TV, or on the DVD extras. I believe many people recognize him by now. So when he was on screen, I am watching the director acting, instead of thinking of him as the character. But then there is the whole 'What does it all mean?' suspense. The more the film paraded all it's quirky characters and their obligatory hang-ups to pass the time, the higher the anticipation for the payoff for all this waiting and near misses. So ultimately I was disappointed due to the high expectations for a big payoff (you know - Close Encounters kind of stuff), that the scant hand or leg here or there just didn't satisfy. Alas, the whole subject matter of who 'they' are and what happens is side-stepped. (You may have heard that some trailers have given it away, which is it true, but not too badly)So I believe the story could have gone through another rewrite. I would've enjoyed less soap opera and more chasing the bogeyman. And a big warning for those who are hooked by the teaser commercials, don't expect to find satisfaction for your curiosity.The few goods things to say are: - Good job to Shyalaman for telling a story in his unique vision, avoiding some clichés. - A ferocious soundtrack that provides most of the special effects. - Decent spooky stuff to give you a chill once in a while.This was no better or worse than Unbreakable. I give it a 6 out of 10.Update: Upon second viewing, I was able to appreciate the terrific acting and cinematography to excuse the over-the-top quirky lines here and there (such as the now infamous ""The Happening""). It is really only the third act that fails to thrill, but it is a good ride up to that point.",Signs

You know like a Scary Movie type thingamajig. Lol, Shyamalan wishes! Some of the suspense segments when isolated are very effective, but the movie as a whole, is a total stinko. How could Mel Gibson even let this happen? He's usually so on the money. But every scene, including his, that's played for drama, bombs like Hezbollah. Cool premise, we all like these alien invader doomsday pieces, but this film needed an awful lot of work.

And it's a more sublime kind of scary than the ""Anything can happen, oh, %&$@!"" kind of scary you might be expecting.So watch it again, later on, now that you understand the tone of the movie.

187,jamiedarlow-37510,Signs is a film to be cherished!,10,15 March 2020,"A profound and incredible masterpiece and Shyamalan's best to date in my opinion! Specifically following the Hess family (Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) during the build up and event of an alien invasion, it's a very intimate, emotional and scary portrayal of a whole families belief during dark times (drawing slightly on themes of Night's previous film Wide Awake). The theme of faith is perfectly explored here; Graham's internal struggle with accepting past tragedy and previous beliefs being in serious jeopardy are wonderfully realised by Gibson's majestic performance; definately a career best and one of the most moving I've ever seen. I also think it features Phoenix's most underrated performance; he is superb as Merrill! The children are perfectly cast also with a pre-Little Miss Sunshine Breslin and Culkin both being absolutely brilliant. Supporting roles from Cherry Jones and M. Night himself are also beautifully played and add so much to the already full rounded and deeply rich storyline and character development. Words cannot describe my love for this film which is mainly due to it having a massive impact on me as a child; one of the most thrilling and definately the most suspenseful film watching experience I've had! The first time watching is quite unlike anything I've ever seen; the tension building is incredible and the sad or bittersweet scenes are heart wrenching. Beautifully edited by Barbara Tulliver, some of the most effective scares I've seen on screen are captured here from the monster outside Bo's window to the chilling home video broadcast on the news. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is gorgeous and the soundtrack by James Newton Howard is his absolute best work; a theme that has stayed with me ever since first hearing it. A work of genius and I don't say that lightly",Signs

Such as something involving a television screen.  I have never heard an audience scream so loud to jump scenes.  The movie starts a little slow but then gets quickly to the point after the word above.  The film has quite some hilarious moments to it, such as when Gibson and Phoenix are trying to find a ""culprit"" and the words they are saying are so funny.  The ending is a different ballgame.

190,smakawhat,Great work!,8,4 August 2002,"From the director of Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable comes another great work for Shyamalan.  This guy is on a ROLE!!  Gibson plays a former priest (Father Graham) who has left the faith.  He is a farmer and also is accompanied by his brother played by Joaquin Phoenix (Merril) who lives on the farm with him.  Graham has ""left the flock"" after the tragic death of his wife in a car accident, and is now left to raise his 2 young kids. However, one day a crop circle appears in his corn field, and at first glance seems a prank.  But later on the events that unfold at Grahams farm, and around the world, put his beliefs to the test.First off, Shyamalan has created another GREAT film.  There is great tension, story telling and casting.  Needless to say the film isn't totally flawless but what is good is done magnificantly.  Shyamalan's tricks us into believing this is a thriller, but in reality its a very spiritual movie about a quest for faith.  Because of this, when things suddenly start to ""go bump in the night"" the movie kind of looses focus from an intelligent look into a troubled family, to becoming almost a horror show.  Keep in mind, the little bumps in the night are done with great artistry!!  Also Shyamalan is now starting to pull off what I call ""Tarrantino"" syndrome, in that he is starting to appear in his films more obviously.  In this one, he is actually a minor character.  His presence doesn't ruin ""Signs"" but it is a bit of a distraction since it is obvious the he is not an actor.Luckily there is very little to be picky about in this film, and I look forward to this guys next ""project"".  EXCELLENT stuff..Rating 8.5 out of 10",Signs
191,bix171,Scary and Moving At The Same Time,10,1 September 2002,"It's easy to see why `Signs' would be such a success with moviegoers: people are constantly looking to have their faith reaffirmed, especially in these times, and a film like this is able to provide that reaffirmation in a unique take on the horror genre. It's scary and moving at the same time. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan has created a far more surprising thriller than he did in his breakthrough `The Sixth Sense', this time constructing a puzzle that you don't realize is a puzzle until the climax. Ostensibly a film about an apparent alien invasion, Shyamalan concentrates his story on a farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania, where a pastor (Mel Gibson, in a carefully constructed performance) who has left the church after the untimely death of his wife struggles to reconcile his anger and disbelief; in this regard it becomes a very personal film questioning not only the presence of God during tragedy but also a God who creates tragedy as part of plans both great and small. Shyamalan creates an unnerving atmosphere by deliberately withholding information about the invasion: most of the news reports are speculative and haphazardly disseminated, allowing the audience to identify and share a sense of dread that lingers long after it's over. Unlike `The Sixth Sense' there's a droll humor that sneaks up on you (a scene involving a teenager's spontaneous confession delightfully tricks you into laughing when you least expect to) and it gives the film a reassuring warmth that helps keep everything centered. Shyamalan seems to realize his limitations as a thinker--he doesn't pretend to be profound--but he does treat his audience with respect and invests his film with an intelligence and wit that's perfect for a studio feature. A very satisfying experience, not easily forgotten or dismissed.",Signs
192,Dockelektro,Chilling... until THAT ending...,8,27 October 2002,"Shyamalan returns, with the weight of having done two remarkable movies on his shoulders. Only two ways, apparently - or he wins, or he fails. Curiously, he manages to do both, unfortunately in the same movie. Here Graham Hess is the main character Shyamalan seems to have a fixation on - the man with something in the past that affects the way he is on the present. The strange crop signals appear, and the menace of Hess' isolated family appear. All is set for a game of creeps and chills fabulously orchestrated by the obviously-gifted Shyamalan. And you will be in the edge of your seat, as a series of creepy encounters happen. If the director had something to prove, it is settled here. As a suspense / mild horror movie, this one gives you the biggest jumps ever this side of The Sixth Sense. And then, comes an ending that, from the man that got us used to have such great endings, is hard to bear. But don't let this spoil the fun. It still remains an excellent thriller, with the quality we seek when we go to the movies to have a good time. And once more it's confirmed: Shyamalan has potential to get to the top. But think it over when you cast yourself into your movie again ok?",Signs
193,barberoux,Sappy but good,8,28 August 2002,"""Signs"" was an entertaining movie.  The acting throughout was good especially Cherry Jones.  The overall tone of Mr. Shyamalan's films is unique.  There seems to be a quiet buildup of tension.  I was somewhat disappointed in the aliens and the action in the last reel.  I think the buildup is done so well that the payoff would have to be tremendous to live up to it.  I found this also to be true in ""Unbreakable"".   Like Spielberg Mr. Shyamalan plays up the tearjerker scenes.SPOILER ahead.The alien reaction to water was a bit much.  A rain storm would wipe them out.  The earth invasion would be thwarted by turning the hose on them. Wouldn't you think after an encounter with morning dew on the corn that they would devise protective clothing.  Also the alien sudden change in personality from elusive spyers to aggressive attackers didn't go.  This seem to be a common problem with monster flicks.SPOILER defunct.Overall this was a good movie well worth seeing.   It is a must for Mel Gibson fans.",Signs

They never saw anything so why run at full speed somewhere then run and turn back. Gibson does this the best.

It kind of derailed it a bit for me near the end.Having said that, the acting on everyone's part especially the kids made me not care so much for the parts that irked me. I genuinely cared what happened to the family. It was a different perspective on end of the world scenario where you only see what's going on from the view point of a family isolated on a rural farm and only getting snippets from television broadcasts of what is happening all around the world.Very well done and felt tense in places.

Ugh.
The water thing is problematic... there are theories of why aliens allergic to water might come to a planet drenched in it, but obviously M Night has never walked through a corn field at night. You would drenched!Also, the news report that people in the Middle East have figured out how to kill the aliens! Well, wait, how? HOW?! It doesn't say.

When I was watching the movie I kept thinking,""the twist is coming any minute now"". But then I realised that a twist wasn't the way to go. It would establish Shamalyan as being a one-dimensional director who can only direct the one kind of movie. Well I'm glad that Signs broke the link, its all for the better.The acting is limited but works very well with what it has. Its leads Gibson and Phoenix are excellent. Luckily, the children aren't typical brattish swines,ie. Spy Kids. And thank the Lord they aren't cocky snobs either, ie. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson. M.

At that point, the movie completely ruined any and all suspense and atmosphere it worked so hard to build. As if we haven't seen enough humanoid aliens in the past, whereas superior alien films, like Alien, work to go against what we already think we know and redesign it. The fact this film was so essentially safe really annoyed me.Can't really say much because there isn't really a plot other than what the title implies.

There are three good things about this movie, and I gave them 1 point each: 1) the acting. 2) Strange as it sounds, some very (intentionally) funny lines 3) It is a piecemeal of much better movies on the same subjects which you briefly relive until sadly reminded this is not one of them.1) The acting in this movie from Gibson down to the little girl is so good that it confirms the old saying that good actors can work with the worst material. It is one of those films we (cough) macho men hate because it makes you cry. Rather, the actors make you cry when they do. The little girl will break your heart several times. 2) The writers should have stuck to comedy. From wearing foil hats to other silliness there are quite a few light touches in the first half of the film that almost make it worth watching. Almost. 3) Unfortunately 99% of the film is not ""horror"", ""sci if"" or anything other than an unintentionally funny mess. It is a poorly connected ripoff of better films from the Exorcist to Close Encounters to War of the Worlds. Not an ""homage"" as some would pretend but a lousy reflection like seeing a beautiful painting reflected in a full toilet.If you can see it for free or cheap, fine. But don't pay money unless you intend to laugh at a trashy mass of plot holes & ripoff of better works. And that's no coincidence.",Signs
201,The_Core,Superb!,9,14 August 2002,"""Signs"" is M. Night Shyamalan at the top of his form.  Every scene meticulously crafted, awe-inspiring camera work and some genuine scares. Interestingly, the two people I saw this film with didn't like it.  One thought it was completely contrived and predictable (which I don't understand at all).  Perhaps Shyamalan creates ""thinking person's"" films, I really don't know.  Having seen both ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" (I liked both, although it took several viewings to understand what the director was aiming at), this one was by far his best work.  Fascinating, flawed and unstereotyped characters (a bit weird, but ""real"" nonetheless) and a wonderful slow pace thankfully free of too much flash and special effects.  Spectactular camera work, a haunting atmosphere... what more can you ask?Hold on... except for the last 5 minutes.  I think I ""got"" the faith message, and didn't need it hammered in with a baseball bat.

202,The_Core,Comments on Reviews...,9,18 August 2002,"I have reviewed this movie already, but wanted to address the points of a couple other reviewers.  Several have brought up the ""atheist in a foxhole"" thing, but apparently they weren't paying attention to the movie (granted, Shymalan's films require a far better than average attention span). Gibson's character never lost his faith, but rather is angry at God over the death of his wife and is despairing (this point is very clearly delineated by a certain scene).  Also, it's interesting that most of the negative reviews tend to focus on inane, cerebral nit-picks that have nothing to do with ""willing suspension of disbelief"" (which is critical to the enjoyment of a fantasy film such as this).  For example, the comments about water, comments like ""this couldn't happen"" or ""that couldn't happen"".... all I can think of to say is ""no kidding, we aren't watching a docu-drama.""  If you can't relax, surrender and allow a movie to stir your subconscious, stay away from Shyamalan films. Perhaps the director succeeded all too well here -- people certainly seem to be polarized over this one, but few are indifferent.  9/10 (please read Roger Ebert's review, which I agree with for the most part).",Signs

If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about, for everyone else, spoilers inbound.*Spoilers start*The aliens' weakness is water. Could have forgiven this if they didn't throw in a line about the real invasion starting now after implying that a small number of aliens had already checked out the planet, because why would they decide to launch a full on invasion of a planet of which two-thirds is covered in what seems like acid to them?They're smart enough to build star-hopping spacecraft, but too dumb to figure out how doors work. Okay.It also seemingly implies that Graham's wife dying was done by God so he could get the message across to him that when the aliens attack...beat them up. And...nothing else. Thanks for cruelly taking my loving wife from me God, never would have thought of that!*Spoilers end*There's also early hints of horrendous dialogue that would go on to shine in his later films, the kids act like the girls from The Shining even though they're not supposed to be creepy, so while I did overall enjoy it, as my friend so brilliantly put it, if you're familiar with Shyamalan's later work, watching this is like being a doctor and noticing the first cancer lump on your patient, that by the time The Happening came out, had tragically and irreversibly spread.So seeing as everyone has a different film that they point to as where Shyamalan started to slip up, this is mine.

204,Gubby-Allen,I paid a tenner for a 2 hour kip.,2,21 September 2002,"Possible spoilers within (although that implies that there is something worth spoiling, which there isn't).There are a few films in the top 250 which I detest, but at least with those films even though I hate them I can at least appreciate their reasons behind being popular.But I am absolutely baffled beyond belief that this films has a ranking to put it anywhere near the top poll. For the life of me I cannot think of one redeeming feature of the plot that would appeal to any like minded viewer. My problems with this film went far beyond that of the unconvincing aliens or equally unconvincing sci-fi aspects of the film.Whether the film sold itself as a horror, chilling, eerie or any similar description I'm not sure, but other commenters have certainly praised it as scary, chilling, pulsating etc etc. Do me a favour! 'Signs' was about as scary or chilling as an episode of Phillip Schofields' National Lottery Jetset. If it was frightening, would it have a certificate of '12'?That was the most annoying part of the film. Given the quality of the cinematography and the expertly chosen scenery, in the opening scenes of the cornfields there was me thinking I was looking at the perfect set of surroundings for the ideal chiller or thriller. It still probably could've been, but was just let down by any sort of remotely interesting set of events.Other viewers & critics seem to be able to still praise a film highly if the acting, shots, directing etc are excellent even if the plot is pretty non existent, but I can't. Granted much of the film other than the story as I said was good, the acting was equally impressive, but there was not one thing to engross the viewer at all.You more or less knew where the story (and I used the term story in the loosest possible sense) would end up from the outset. Although despite that, it still struck me as a film where much of it seemed made up as it went along and still needed to be redrafted. More like a collection of scenes than a 2 hour film.The characters, despite being played well, were all devoid of any interest whatsoever. Consequently you never felt any liking for them & never really gave a toss what would happen to them. Mel's flashbacks served more as an irritation, with the boy I was never assured of his role as to whether he was your typical brainy geek or or someone a bit dim, and yet again the young girl seemed to play a role and speak in the manner of someone far older than herself. The rest of their behaviour & the other characters were academic & largely irrelevant. So much of the characters seemed cliched and flogged to death in previous films.Some of the time I felt like I was watching a remake of ideas and a plot that I'd seen before, but then each time it seemed like a new idea may introduce itself it came over as ridiculous. Aliens that could leap over a roof and with technology to travel the world, but not able to get out of a kitchen or through a door with a plank of wood nailed to it. And the water? what was that all about, they come to earth with nothing to defend themselves from the earths inhabitants or from the rain or water that covers 4/5 of the planet.A few commenters have claimed the film to be funny. Unless it is through laughing at ideas like those above and not with them, then I must have been watching a different film. The cinema was reasonable full but there was not a single hint of laughter from anyone from start to finish.I feel a bit sorry for the director though. His two main works prior to this have both revolved around a 'twist' to shock the viewer, so people come to expect it in this. Even those who enjoyed Signs, surely cannot claim there was any sort of twist in this. To me, it all passed without a moment of interest or shock and at no point had anything to keep the viewer guessing, asking questions to themselves or surprised, and consequently nothing really happened.2/10 (1 for the location & 1 because it's better then any of the Robin Askwith films that occupy all my 1/10's)",Signs
205,mirosuionitsaki2,Best Horror Movie I've Ever Seen..,10,13 July 2007,"SIGNS was one of the best movies I've seen so far, or probably it is the best. I have an interest in learning about alien civilization, is there life on other planets, etc. This movie was interesting as it showed us what is probably the views of M. Night Shyamalan on this subject.I thought it was odd how those aliens were injured by the touch of water when actually our oxygen contains a small percentage of water. Maybe they should have said they get injured by a large percentage of water but no one knew that and no one really cares about that.I love how Morgan could hear the aliens on a walkie-talkie and everyone went on top of the vehicle to listen. It really frightened me and I never want to hear that sound again or I will grow insane.When every channel on the television showed the same news report on UFOs and everyone hiding really made me think about the end of the world, also, it reminded me of Hurricane Katrina when I had to stay away from the window because a whole group of people were breaking in a store across the street of my home and looting.The scene where they showed a ""recording"" of children screaming because there was an alien outside hiding from the bushes at someone's birthday party really freaked me out.I think this movie was a great film and I'm almost too scared to watch it again.

206,basrutten,Suspense over Substance,7,20 November 2002,"""Signs"" is a movie that's mainly interesting because it's genuinely scary (at least in the cinema). The director M. Night Shyamalan proves beyond a doubt that he's very adept at creating suspenseful moments out of basically nothing and uses suggestion and vagueness to build the tension. It works really well. The rest of the movie is so-so. The acting by the adults (Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix) is quite strong but the little kids are once again nearly unbearable to watch, mainly because they say things no kid of their age would normally say. The story is kept intentionally vague since it serves only as a framework for the suspenseful scenes, which I think is excusable. It's not like we needed a new ""Indepedence Day"" anyway. 
Where the movie does go wrong, however, is in the message, ""Everything happens for a reason"", it's trying to get across. There's way too much quasi-religious talk in this movie for my taste. I don't believe in predestination and this movie certainly didn't make me change my mind about that. The whole alien invasion (including all the lives that it claims) seems to happen simply to give Mel Gibson his faith back, and Mel's son has asthma solely because he wouldn't die of the alien nerve gas that way? Come on... Without the message and the religious angle, I would have loved this movie. As it is, the movie is still pretty good (since it's really scary) but not a classic like ""Sixth Sense"" was. **1/2 out of **** stars",Signs
207,Catharina_Sweden,A movie about finding one's way back to faith,7,28 July 2012,"I am not that into science fiction - or fantasy for that matter - because I always want to LEARN something as well, when I watch a movie or read a novel. Something about the real world. It feels like a waste of time to learn about creatures that do not exist, worlds that do not exist etc.. But occasionally I make an exception, if a movie has received good reviews or if there are actors that I like in it. As is the case with ""Signs"".I think the most important issue was the former clergyman's return to faith. This could have been brought about by any external forces or events - the aliens were not really the important thing here. I think Mel Gibson portrayed this process very believably.If I look upon the movie as as science fiction-movie, I think it was also quite good in this respect. I liked the way they found an explanation for the strange concentric circles, that have appeared all over the world IN REALITY. The explanation was not too far-fetched, either - it fit in with the rest of the events. I do not think this movie is for real hard-core sf-enthusiasts though, because they usually want more scientific, astronomical, and technical details and facts. In this movie the human aspect was more important than science.One thought though: it is, if you think about it, quite odd to have God and aliens in the same movie. Because if both exist, God most have created the aliens as well. In his image..??? And if this is so, why is this not mentioned anywhere in the Bibel..?",Signs
208,shadowman123,Very good. Not to be compared to Independence Day or War Of The Worlds.,8,29 December 2005,"After watching the Dr.Who xmas invasion I decided to go with my alien invasion / sci-fi mood . When I checked out the trailer for Signs , it looked really good and appealed to me and I decided to go and check it out . What I first of all would like to say is if your going to watch this film and are expecting a huge epic like Independence Day or War of the Worlds then forget it . This movie does not use special affects a lot but instead builds up tension and suspense just like back in the ""old days"" when you people would be glued to the TV with your jaw touching the ground not believing what happening . Thats what Signs done for me . Instead of showing space ships tearing New York,Tokyo , London apart or F-16 fighter jets roaring through the sky , your given huge level of tension that builds up and jumps out at you at all the right moments . Mel Gibson and the future Jhonny Cash-Joaquin Phoneix were a joy to watch and also the 2 kids all pulled in brilliant acting performances . I guess the only real flaw was how much info could the little boy pull out of one book which seemed a little odd as to how all his theories could be correct ???? But in general a brilliant film and not to be missed ! 8.5 out of 10 for me .",Signs

210,GirishGowda,Not a Typical Sci-Fi Thriller,8,28 May 2010,"This a very good movie . Mel Gibson's and Joaquin Phoenix's characters are not over the top and they are like a real family. Mel Gibson gets to try to portray an understated, confused, and emotionally scarred character. Joaquin also gets play a similar character, though he is less inhibited than Mel Gibson. Their calm, sullen personalities contrast with the unbearable situation they find themselves in. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, this is one of his best movies and a very underrated one at that. I saw this movie when it was released back in 2002 and I was very impressed and I have seen it quite a few times since then. I didn't even know that the cute little Bo was Abigail Breslin until last night when I was reading her acting credits. I like that girl very much and she is immensely talented.Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest who has lost his faith after his wife was killed in a freak car accident. Six months later, he discovers a gigantic crop circle in his yard. Similar events begin to happen all over the world. Graham's children, Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin) think it is aliens, his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) thinks it's pranksters, and Graham doesn't know what to think. The crop circles cause a media frenzy and test Graham's faith as he journeys to find out the truth behind the crop circles. When the truth is discovered and it turns out his children are right and the aliens have come to take over the planet, it becomes a battle to save his children from the aliens.One of the reasons why this film is hated by some is the idiocy of the aliens. They can make huge crop circles in the middle of the night without anybody noticing, but they can't break down a door and enter into a house!! Even I was surprised, but not angered. It is like in some vampire movies where you have to open the door and invite the vampires in for them to come inside a home. The direction is amazing and Mel, Joaquin and the kids give awesome performances. Mel Gibson's character doesn't have as much dialogue as his kids have. Abigail Breslin is so cute in the movie. She is a attention grabber even when she doesn't have any dialogues and I loved her. Rory Culkin as the son who has asthma is also quite good. The atmosphere is bleak and they are all alone in their home. They do not contact other people much and this is a major factor in the delivery of the movie. Shyamalan is interested more in the human drama within the family, rather than the invasion itself, that is where he is brilliant. All the built up tensions in the family is being thrown right into each other's face due to the impending apocalypse. The reason for the alien invasion and their subsequent running away to their home planet may have come off cheesily, but it didn't. It seemed very realistic that water could be like acid to these creatures. Though the aliens come in only a couple of scenes, the tension is immense and I got scared a couple of times. The climax when Graham tells Merril to swing away is amazing. The aliens could have destroyed Earth by their weapons and all humans could have been extinguished and they could have won. Or humans could have blasted them away from the skies. Why didn't they do that? That was the problem with this movie. Still, it is brilliant if you do not think about that.8/10",Signs
211,BillBayard,Shyamalan's second best film,9,3 November 2021,"Shyamalan is one of the most erratic director's working today. He can create fascinating things and he create dreadfully boring films, but I will say that even among the worst they most tend to have an interesting idea behind them. Problem is he can only get some of these interesting ideas to work and fails with the execution of quite a few others. I think this is an excellent sci-fi film from beginning to end. It does not waste a minute getting started and it is always interesting and at various times tense, scary, funny, sad, touching and extremely well aced by its four principle performers. I've never had a fondness for Mel Gibson in most things, but I think this is perhaps his best performance. Joaquin Phoenix is wonderfully light on his feet here and is both delightful and moving. Rory Culkin proved early on who was the true talent in this family and little itty bitty Abigail Breslin is perfect. When it comes to children's performance they must, of course, have some talent or at least have the ability to be at ease in front of a camera and crew, but foremost they need a strong director who knows how to bring out the best in a child actor and they have that here. Shyamalan's direction of them and the entire film is near perfection. The only other role of size here is played by the wonderful Cherry Jones and she is so likeable in this. It's a shame that this great stage actress has never had a great film role to play. There are many who don't like this film and I'm not sure why, but it offers so much to me.",Signs
212,BigGuy,"Tense and thrilling, but a bit weak at the end",6,2 August 2002,"This is another remarkable work by M. Night Shyamalan, at least until the ending.  The ending wasn't bad, but it lacked the uncertainty that marked his other works.  As the end of the movie rolled around there was a point when everything became very obvious and even felt a bit contrived.  Of course that was sort of the point but it was still too heavy handed.The movie as a whole was very beautifully done.  The style is completely Shyamalan, who seems to pay extraordinary attention to the visual details. The effect is somewhat diminished by the funny looking aliens...  Although I think men in costume are better than the inevitably fake look of CGI.There was also a small problem with the casting.  Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are supposed to be brothers, but there is clearly at least 20 years of age between them.  Sure Mel looks good for his age and Joaquin was made to look old for his age, but the gap was still large enough to be confusing, especially because the chemistry feels more like father-son (or maybe uncle-nephew) than older-younger brother.  Incidentally it doesn't become clear until a third of the way through what the relationship is.  Of course they both put in good performances, on par with their best.Aside from the three minor points, too foreshadowed/clean ending, no so good aliens, and the age issue, this movie was very enjoyable.  There were moments of laughter to break the tension (too much tension is after all as bad as not enough).  The children were amazingly cute (how many Caulkin's are there anyway?).  Also it is refreshing to see a large scale problem (aliens) and how it relates to only one specific family, which incidentally prevents the movie from being too preachy.  It is about one man's choice and not saying it is globally the right choice.  I give it 8/10 with a possible upgrade to 9/10 upon further review.",Signs

This film is comparable to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, in which, we don't see much gore, or the thing that is meant to scare us. Rather, Shyamlan builds up the suspense and plays off of the audience's fear of the subject matter. The film stars Mel Gibson as a farmer in Pennsylvania who is more thank shocked to find out that there are crop circles in his cornfield. Great performances by Gibson, as well as by Joaquin Phoenix make the film memorable. Also, the dialogue is wonderful. Shyamalan is truly one of the finest filmmakers out there today. ***",Signs
215,vox-sane,A Masterpiece (MASSIVE SPOILERS),10,28 August 2002,"(Warning:  There are SPOILERS ahead)""Signs"" underscores the blatant hypocrisy of critics of summer movies. They complain that summer blockbusters use noise and explosions in lieu of plot and are rarely thoughtful.  ""Signs"" is an extremely thoughtful summer blockbuster, and one that relies on mood and indirection, the way Spielberg built ""Jaws"", or they way Hitchcock constructed his suspense movies.  The problem?  Well, the thoughtfulness of ""Signs"" takes a different direction than critics like.Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is having a crisis of faith after the accidental death of his wife.  He's living on a farm in Pennsylvania with his children, as if hiding from the world and the eye of God.  He's angry at God, and won't even allow prayer in his house.  A set-up shot shows a spot on the wall where a cross or crucifix once hung.  Because of his crisis he's run away from his congregation and hidden himself away from humanity, with whom he either feels or wants to feel no connection.  His brother (Joaquin Phoenix) also lives with him.Bizarre things begin happening on the Hess farm.  Crop circles.  The family dog attacks the children.  Odd persons are seen indistinctly in the darkness outside.  At first he thinks he's the victim of hoaxers and vandals. Slowly, and with some hair-raising scenes, Father Hess grows aware of the possibility of an alien invasion of earth -- and one of the signs seems to be in his own cornfield.  But are the aliens (if there are aliens) vegetarians come to be friends;  or have they come to destroy, and enslave humanity?  The movie takes the latter course, and after one of the best gradual set-ups in movie history (or at least since the death of Hitchcock) the Hess family finds themselves locked in a cellar with really mean aliens running through the house and trying to get in to do them some harm. These aren't your wussy Spielberg phone-homers.  These are the the sort who are probably kin to the aliens that burst out of John Hurt's chest.Despite the excellence of the movie's unfolding, many viewers have fundamental misunderstandings of the way the movie works.  The movie is the story of a man's crisis of faith set during the time of an alien invasion of the earth.  Most critics (professional and amateur) seem to think Father Graham Hess has _lost_ his faith.  In fact, he hasn't.  This is clarified later, when his son seems ready to die of an asthmatic seizure.  It's clear at that point that Father Hess has never lost his belief in God's existence, but he has lost his sense that God is beneficent, and he certainly doesn't like the way God sometime works (all believers have this problem, quick to ask God where God was in bad times but rarely acknowledging his presence during fat times).  All believers in any religious, philosophical, social or political doctrine) should at some point reconsider the very foundations of their belief:  do they hold a social, scientific, political, or religious hypothesis because that's how they were broght up?  Have they let others (parents, peers, teachers) impose beliefs on them?  Did they have individual enlightenment?  Do they really understand what they believe in any of the above contexts?Father Graham was having a crisis of faith, which every believer in anything should have if he's a healthy thinker;  he hasn't lost a belief in God, but he has had the foundations of what he thought God was undermined.  This is a healthy thing in Christianity or Judaism, since in these traditions one accepts God for what God is, rather than attempting to impose one's own personality on the Creator.As for the vapid criticisms that a man's faith in ""traditional"" faiths should be undermined by extraterrestrials, the argument is extraordinarily shallow and shows a lack of understanding, certainly of Bible based faith, Jewish or Christian, and not only in their theology but their history.  In fact, there has been long and fascinating debate a long time about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  There are many strands of Christian thought dating even from the middle ages (and no, no one ever was burned for suggesting such a thing, it's not a heresy).  The strand of thought most intriguing to me suggests that God alone is unique and Satan is not; therefore the drama of fall and redemption happens throughout the universe. If one reads the Bible it says, ""In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth . . .""  That humble sentence covers hundreds of thousands of years in the age of the universe.  But the Bible is a book about God's realtionship to intelligent carbon-based life forms on the planet Earth, and the second sentence focuses on the Earth.  There are suggestions through Scripture that there are other worlds, but until the time of Canon Copernicus it was little understood what forms these worlds might take.  But it was never a part of Christian doctrine that man was unique -- or alone -- in the universe (though he may yet prove to be).The ending is invariably misunderstood, and is set up by an earlier scene involving Father Hess' brother.It's not clear what happened to the alien invaders at the end.  Did they have a strategic withdrawal?  Will they be back?  Possibly.  This is the purpose of the last scene:  Just as in an earlier scene Father Hess' brother went into an army recruiting station, probably toying with the idea of enlisting in case the earth was under attack, so Father Hess has enlisted to fight the invaders the best way he knows how.  Some people go into war to fight to defend their country (or planet) but others have to clean up: medics, preachers and priests, and people just to carry stretchers or wash up.  Father Hess has re-enlisted in God's service to give spiritual aid and comfort while his brother may enlist in the armed forces to fight the earth's enemy physically.  Even if the aliens don't return, it is clear there is much misery, death, and broken-heartedness among the survivors, and Father Hess, having been through his own crisis, is well equipped to help people understand their own loss;  he's as much a healer, at the end, as a doctor, and as much a fighter as his brother may be as a soldier.  Others will be better for his suffering and doubt.Anyone hoping for a trick ending is disappointed (as Father Hess tried to impose himself on God, so too many critics and viewers have tried to impose themselves on the movie, refusing to accept it as it was and therefore rejecting it out of hand), but anyone who has given the movie thought will understand why the ending is perfect, and why the movie is therefore a masterpiece:  Father Hess has not out of the blue regained lost faith; he's come to better understand a God he never doubted, and because of the uncertainty of the alien situation, he has to serve both God and his fellow men the best way he knows how.  He's lost the love of his life (his wife) but he has too much love to give, both for God and mankind, to hide himself in a cornfield when people need him.  It's a courageous ending, a thoughtful ending, well set up, and most professional critics hate it because they hate Christianity and the fact that it is portrayed in a not unpleasant light. But anti-Christians can take heart:  there is only one scene of unmitigated theological discussion, and it undercuts the idea of comfort in religion alone.  If you're hiding in your own ""cornfield"" from the possibilty of a God, so much that you can't even bear the mention of one in a pluralistic society but must see them silenced, you won't be offended.  The movie is anything but preachy:  I don't recall the name of Christ actually mentioned, though it may have been;  and it certainly has no such heavy preachy theological mumbo-jumbo as we get in George Lucas' movies about ""The Force"".Ultimately, the movie does consider free will vs predestination.  Which gets the upper hand?  Both.  While the movie is full of unexplained and unexplainable little oddities that gradually converge, Father Hess himself must tie the (seeming) coincidences together.  God gives ""signs"", but Hess must pick up on them.  And this, too, is sound theology.  It's not the signs themselves, though, that ultimately lead to Father Hess' conversion to God (he reminds me of John Wesley, who was a fairly poor preacher for many years before he actually had a conversion and a sense of the reality of the Redemptive power of Jesus Christ).The movie, while thoughtful and largely quiet (not full of explosions), contains many scenes of suspese that will become classic:  the Hesses climbing up on the family car to pick up ""alien"" signals on a baby monitor, for instance;  nd the momentarily glimpse of a green leg disappearing in the corn (and it ain't the jolly green giant).  The suspense is relieved by moments of comedy, most involving Phoenix but also in the David Lynchean parade of local townspeople.",Signs
216,moviedude1,Scared? You bet!,8,10 December 2003,"This is a great movie for the sci fi fan who also likes Mel Gibson! Dealing with crop circles, former priest (but still farmer) Gibson also deals with the recent loss of his wife and raising his two children.I didn't know what to expect from this film, I really didn't.  I only paid half attention to it when the trailers advertised it in theaters and I gave it no thought at all when it came out on video.  My significant other is a HUGE Mel Gibson fan, so I settled down to watch it the other night with her.When the movie opens up we find Gibson dealing with quitting the church, the loss of his life and his dogs going nuts out in the corn field.  Although we never saw anything out of the ordinary (in the beginning), I found myself hoping that this was, like most of the other crop circle formations, that it was all a hoax.  So much for that idea!  When we finally did see what was going on, I was definitely on the edge of my seat the rest of the film!

It almost has the feel of an old Midnight/Cult movie. A movie that transports your mind and feelings into a place of its own. It is not really scary, but it is plenty spooky and strange. Moreover, you  get caught up in what is happening in the story and you think about how you might act if the same really happened to you. You play their actions in your mind and ask, is that what I would do? The story starts and you think like you are supposed to, this is not happening. However, as the movie develops, you are involved and it is happening. There are strong messages of faith and love in this film, just like in M. Night's other films.

218,ryan_kuhn,How Would You Stand Up to Aliens?,9,13 February 2005,"Some movies are seen as one type, when it really is another. Signs is one of them. Most moviegoers thought they were going in to see an alien invasion movie, when in fact Signs is a study of what would one family do if there was a terrible threat from above. The ultimate ending of the planet Earth is not hanging in the balance through the action we see, rather, just the fate of one family. M. Night Shyamalan's third feature film chronicles a rural family living outside of Philadelphia where crop circles begin to appear in the corn fields. The setup is there, and Shyamalan uses the expectation of aliens going ""bump"" in the night to play on the audience's fears and create a tense mood of what could be. Mel Gibson plays the father who was once an Episcopilian priest who left the flock after the death of his wife. He lives with his two young children, well acted by Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, and his brother, played by Joaquin Phoenix on a farm in the middle of acres of corn. The focus of the movie is entirely on the family, with the only outside contact coming through their television, as they watch newscaster trying to figure out what is going on in the world. Here, the talking heads on TV are not plot-movers, they are experiencing the same doubt and fear that the families watching at home are going through. My favorite scene in the film is that of when a Brazilian family catch a glimpse of an alien. It has a certain realness to it, as if we were going to catch home video of an alien, it would look just like it does in the movie. The ultimate resolution of the movie has been a source of consternation among moviegoers, if you think really hard about it, on the surface it may not make sense, but you do not know how desperate the invaders are and what kind of risks they will take, even if that means invading a planet that is 80% harmful. The important thing is that it does not matter how it ends, the important part of Signs is how the family deals with the invasion, not how it ends. We can identify with the family, we can put ourselves in their shoes. What would we do? No phasers here, just trying to survive. I appreciated the change, not all alien movies have to end with hi-tech, Buck Rogers weapons.",Signs
219,maddiebuggie,Signs (review),4,3 May 2020,I loved Mel Gibson acting in this movie. This was a movie that all about aliens but yet there wasn't enough scenes that had to do with the aliens themself. I was disappointed with how short of a tile we got to see the aliens. I wish they were in the movie longer. The movie wasn't the most entertaining itself. I did want to finish every second of it and see what was gonna happen but I would prob never watch it again since there was a few problems. One problem was not enough time spend on the aliens themselves. Prob two there wasn't enough emotion in this story. Problem three there wasn't enough action in this story. For some of the characters I didn't care if they died or not. I think Mel Gibson did the best job acting in this movie for sure. He made the movie worth finishing.

220,MF210,An Improvement Over Unbreakable,8,14 September 2003,"My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. In 1999, M. Night Shyamalan made a movie called the Sixth Sense, In My Opinion it was a near-masterpiece. The Next Year, he made his follow up film Unbreakable, while the film was good it was also a bit of a disappointment. In 2002, Shyamalan has made Signs, it is a good movie, one of the best movies of the summer of 2002, but not quite as good as The Sixth Sense.The acting is pretty good. Mel Gibson is quite good here. Joaquin Phoenix delievers a great and funny performance. The two kids also deliver good performances. Shyamalan has a role in his movie, but he is actually the weak point in the acting. Signs is a well-written and well planned thriller. The movie jumped me a few times and gave me the creeps. The film also has a very good and effective Music Score.

What makes it work are many things; the way the aliens are filmed where you see only shadows and quick shots of them and especially those creepy clicking sounds they make. The actors are well cast and highly effective in moving things along and adding to the film's authenticity. Tak Fujimoto's brilliant cinematography also adds realism and moodiness to the proceedings as does James Newton Howard's score. Mel Gibson is great as usual as is Joaquin Phoenix who adds a touch of humor to the story. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin in her film debut illustrate why they are exceptional young actors. Shyamalan's pacing and techniques are indicative of his film making talent. His screenplay makes this just as much a testing of one's faith tale as it is a science fiction story. I am hoping that Shyamalan will re-discover the creativity of his early films as they are exceptional works of film-making.",Signs
222,FKDZ,Suspenseful slow burn thriller.,6,2 July 2021,"I've held off watching this movie for a very long time every since I was really young and not at all into horror/scary movies. Today finally came the day and well, what was young me scared for?!That aside, in general I liked the film, It really takes its time though, the directing, the acting, the dialog, its all slow and methodical. It really is a slow burn. But doesn't peak as much as I had hoped.The sound design is great, loved it and would've been a treat to see in theaters. Performances are fantastic all over the board, Joaquin doing some incredible things.The story in itself and the invasion are what lack for me, the invasion is very much downplayed and somehow boring in a way, oversimplified. The story really contains itself in that house and doesn't really tread any further which makes the outside world feel a little distant. The story I find a bit hard to believe (pun intended) and I don't really see why the main character came to the conclusion he did.One of the biggest negatives of this movie though is the fact it has 2002 CGI, they tried to hide it, aka making it all blurry. But 99% of the shots in this movie could've have been done with practical effects and makeup which would make it sooooo much more effective. Right now its too noticeable and definitely took me out of the moment.In the end, I expected a bit more out of the movie. So for me its ends up being a 6/10. Suspenseful but unfulfilling.",Signs

But, I have always maintained that you do not have to suspend logic. By that, I mean, a movie should be consistent within the parameters it sets for itself. This movie did not.SPOILERS: I could go on all day, but how did the alien whose fingers got cut off manage to figure out where to come??? Was it looking for revenge? Where did it pick up the friend? Furthermore, they can travel across time, but they can't figure out how to get out of a closet??? And, why exactly doesn't it have any weapons? It can travel across time, but it can't carry a 6 shooter??? And, what is with the water? We have figured out how to wear protective covering since the middle ages, but despite being able to travel across time, they can't figure out how to protect themselves from water??? I mean, it was just one big duh after another in the last 30 minutes or so. They can travel across time, they plan to take over our world, and they need crop circles to tell them where to congregate??? PLEASE!!!The irony is that when we first went to this movie, we only got to see the first 70% of it before the theater - and all the other theaters - were evacuated for some fire (supposedly). So, we went back at a later date. We would have been better off never having gone back and just appreciating the first 70% and imagining the last 30%.

226,Hang_All_Drunkdrivers,OK but slow - typical Shyamalan,6,26 March 2006,"SPOILERS - I thought this show was about crop circles, a subject i think deserves a lot more attention than it gets. So i watched it but instead, it's really about an alien invasion and there are some glaring problems in how the story plays out. Many posters have commented about how silly it was for water-averse aliens to come to a planet teeming with water. That didn't bother me because the aliens were after the humans and apparently decided the water was just a problem to be avoided. What bothered me is how at the end of the movie, the aliens were able to break thru the boarded up windows and doors of the farm house but couldn't break thru the basement door to get at the humans they wanted. They tried for hours but couldn't do it!! And then there's that bizarre scene where Mel Gibson gets to talk to his wife who's been literally CUT IN HALF in a car wreck. Talk about nonsense.Despite these liabilities i still give this a 6 cause i did enjoy the movie and it was suspenseful.",Signs
227,NerdBat,"Greatly put together, but somewhat boring plot",6,22 July 2018,"As my headliner says, this movie was oddly enough, pretty good. You couldn't go to a movie store or blockbuster in the early 2000's and not see at least an advertisement for this movie. It was really big. That being said, I was actually pretty impressed when I finally sat down and watched it with my boyfriend. My main issue is that the aliens themselves seem to be the secondary issue that is somewhat overlooked, while the actual hysteria caused by their presence seems to cause more issues than anything else. We're watching the movie and everything is going along good, but near the end, we suddenly hear on the radio that the aliens are leaving earth. You never see any ships, and you only get quick glimpses at the aliens themselves. I feel like this was a pretty decent movie, but there is so much more that could have been done with it.",Signs
228,Jakealope,Has It's Faults and Plot Holes But Still Worthwhile,5,12 November 2009,"The alien invasion movie is the oldest but best draw in basic sci fi movies, so MNS's take on this shopworn plot gets some pluses for originality. He is the type of guy who is so earnest and such a good filmmaker that you can enjoy this movie even though parts of it are just plain dumb like schmaltzy sentimental fatherly monologues about his children's' birth during the scariest part of the movie. There were enough and incessant Christian and spiritual references to fill 2 months of sermons with near idolatry of the preacher's dead wife thrown in for a Mary hail. But the lamest part of the movie were the aliens: the weakest, most incompetent bunch of losers to ever build interstellar ships and invade earth. The Boy Scouts could have driven them off. But it was scary in parts, as well as thoughtful, almost too thoughtful. It was fun seeing Mel play a introverted, non heroic sort of family guy, not the demented kill them all father he played in ""The Patriot"" or ""Braveheart"" or a 100 other ones. The best actor was Rory Culkin playing his young son, who is much better than his more famous but obnoxious brother, The daughter, precocious 6 year old Boo, was played well by a wee actress named Abigail Breslin. While young actresses & actors are natural scene stealers, she was precious and enjoyable. Certainly better than that screechy obnoxious pre-teen monster Dakota Fanning played in the latest version of ""War of the World"". In that movie the main disappointment was not having both kids killed off for their general useless bratty behavior in a time of extreme danger and emergency. One more note, if you are looking for special effects there are next to none. There are no fancy ships, death rays or mass death and destruction.",Signs
229,Ginger87,Interesting...,9,29 August 2004,"*May Contain Spoilers*""Signs"" was a very interesting movie, in fact I saw it in theaters twice. It wasn't like any other movie I've seen before. I found ""Signs"" to be a very good movie with some sad parts and some scary parts. I think the acting was good and the special effects were awesome.In my opinion the scariest part of the movie is when Bo tells her father that there is a monster outside her window. That part freaked me out. I think the saddest part is when Mel Gibson's character is having his last conversation with his wife. I cried during that part.Overall I suggest everyone should see ""Signs"" because you will really enjoy it. I give ""Signs"" 9/10 stars.",Signs
230,LuboLarsson,Well?,6,15 September 2002,"I'm not sure about this film at all, yes it was well directed, and Gibson and co were fine, but I was disappointed with this film when I left the cinema about an hour ago. To say why I was disappointed would need me to reveal to much of the storyline, and since this film has only been in the country for 3 days I can't do that. What I will say is the trailers on TV for this are in my opinion VERY misleading. I notice in some magazines the director of this film is being compared to Steven Spielberg, well I noticed something he done in this film that was very similar to Spielberg, there is a section in the film when Mel's character is flicking through a book about Aliens, and the audience has the chance to see the pictures in the book, this reminded me of the part in Jaws when Roy Scheider is flicking through a book about sharks, which was a clever way of showing what could be about to happen. This film is a long way short of films of the class of Jaws or Close encounters though... a long way off.",Signs

233,llihilloh,"Oh, how previews are so very, very deceiving.",2,17 January 2003,"Where do I begin?  I sat down to watch 'Signs' just the other night.  I had been wanting to see it ever since it was still playing at the theaters.  My aunt rented it and the only thing that came out of my mouth, along with a few swear words here and there, was how I was so glad that I didn't waste my hard-earned money on such garbage.  This is the kind of film that gets everyone's attention when those clever but sneaky advertising jerks decide to air the trailer picking out the ONLY half interesting scenes in the entire film.  Man, I hate when they do that. However, I would do it too if I were in their position.  Why wouldn't I? Anyway, the previews looked really good; little did I know that they were extremely deceiving, and the film managed to stay at the top of the box office list for a while, so I figured that it couldn't be all bad.  Don't believe it!Aside from the terrible acting, lack of excitement, scares and intelligence, it moved at a pace that would irritate anybody, or so I thought, but being that a lot of people did like it for some reason, who knows anymore. 'Signs' also lacks...what's that thing called?  Oh, yeah, dialogue.  Was it just me or did it seem like there was absolutely no talking in this picture? It was all show, actions, and not enough speaking.  It reminded me of 'Cast Away' in that sense, and I don't even want to get into that disaster.  So, moving along. The acting shown here is pathetic.  I know that everyone likes Mel Gibson and the guy earns up to $25 million a pic, but honestly, for what?  He looked out of it for the most part; what is Shyamalan really doing behind those cameras?  He didn't react to anything like he should have, his very few speaking parts were boring, drawn out, and a lot of them really had nothing to do with the plot itself.  Those really long monologues were unbearable. Joaquin Phoenix was just a tad better than Gibson, but still had nothing to show for it.  Another Culkin pops onto the screen and I have to say, he was probably the best actor in this film.  Most people found the young Abigail Breslin to be impressive while I found her to be purely annoying.  Oh, and the biggest laugh of all, you guessed it, the man behind this terrible project, M. Night Shyamalan, works his way onto the screen. That's right, he's not only the writer, director and producer, he's also an actor.  Who are you kidding, M?  It really bugs me to no end when those hot shot directors and all happen to make a cameo in their films just because they're their films and they can do whatever they please.I can at least see where this plot would have been a good idea, but it gets ruined.  The ending was a big mistake.  For some reason, I thought that it would pick up just a bit toward the end, but it didn't.  It was a huge disappointment as was the entire film as I have pointed out.  The script, the actual writing was so boring.  I found 'Signs' to move at a slow pace, yet it seemed to me that just as I had slipped the tape into my VCR, it wasn't only but a half hour or so after that I was finishing up the film.  I guess I should be thankful for that.I would not recommend 'Signs' to anyone, and I mean anyone.  The writing, the acting, the directing, the beginning, middle and end were all poorly projected.  Shyamalan managed to rake in the bucks (and the rave reviews) yet again, though I don't understand how.  Between 'The Sixth Sense' and this trash, it's a wonder this guy can find people to back him up whenever he comes up with a new idea.  'Signs' is a horrible film that only seemed good due to its misleading previews.I would have avoided this film all together, but it's not like they warned me it would be as bad as it was.",Signs
234,merrywood,Signs of intellectual weakness.,2,8 August 2002,"Researchers who have spent decades studying the worldwide, mysterious phenomena of crop circles and land glyphs that are sometimes larger than several football fields side by side and yet form in minutes have postulated that the event is also ancient.  Evidences of this global mystery are age old. 	The attempt in this film of Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan to suddenly tie the historic phenomena to a wafer-thin, comic book contrivance of hostile alien incursion certainly does not wash.  At the level of the story we find in its text constant broadcast media reports of the aliens with no absolutely detail on their method or behavior.  We see items such as the hero confronting an alien locked in a pantry, the alien apparently weak as a kitten then later escapes, again giving no detail as to his escape but then having gained supernatural power.  Our hero cuts off some of its fingers afterward not seeking help from the police, nor mentioning the traumatic confrontation to no one.  He just goes about expressing fright.  In the subtext we find the hero, a minister, giving up his life commitment to God and humanity, in childish fashion, somehow forgetting all of his theological studies and comprehension of the complex universal workings of a supreme intelligence after the untimely death of his wife.  Some minister.  The entire mishmash of a production is given a bit of value only by the extraordinary performance of Mel Gibson who must have suffered working with the terrible script.	If you want to see a truly scary, brilliantly written and produced film about some comic book extraterrestrial alien threat check out THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, the Howard Hawks 1951 classic usually credited to Christian Nyby. Any number of extraterrestrial threat films of this genre with stories going back as far as a century ago with H. G. Wells' WAR OF THE WORLDS is superior. We expected much more from this writer director after his solid showing in THE SIXTH SENSE.",Signs
235,senortuffy,Lightweight psychodrama.,6,8 May 2003,"I like Mel Gibson as an actor, really, but just not in fatherly roles like he plays here or in ""The Patriot.""  His portrayal of a priest who's lost his faith wrapped around a story of alien invasion just didn't strike me as real.  He's much better as a wise-cracking cop, like in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series or the rugged loner in the ""Mad Max"" trilogy.The movie centers around a conversation Mel has with his nephew, in which he postulates that there are two kinds of people in this world - those who believe in miracles and destiny, and those who believe things just happen for no real reason.  Mel plays a reverend in a small Pennsylvania farming community who recently lost his wife in a freak auto accident.  He's left the church because of his loss of faith and is now bitter and rudderless in life.  His house is a mess and his family is breaking up.Then one day, crop circles appear in his corn field.  Soon after, strange beings show up on the farm and in the community.  His asthmatic son, played by Macaulay Culkin's younger brother, Rory, is curious about the aliens, sensing right away that this is a real invasion. Mel's daughter, played by the cute-as-a-button Abigail Breslin, seems more awed by what's happening than frightened.  Joaquin Phoenix plays Mel's nephew, who's helping out around the farm, and he's decidedly in the camp of this is all a miracle of some sort.The ""signs"" from the title refers to events leading to other events in the lives of the characters.  The movie is supposed to make us realize that all things are connected and that we should look for signs in our lives, but the overall effect is a bit clumsy in the movie.A conversion Mel has with his dying wife in which her last words are, ""Hit away,"" ties in with Merrill's (Joaquin Phoenix) skills with a baseball bat, which comes in handy when an alien invades their house and snatches the little boy.  Alot is made of the fact that the boy's asthma actually saves him from the alien's attempt to poison him with some gas.  The asthma is a sign?  God made him asthmatic in order to save him?  That's what Mel thinks.The movie is entertaining and a bit spooky.  Much of the movie feels like you're part of someone's dream, sort of like Shayamalan's ""The Sixth Sense."" But I was expecting something more complex from the appearance of the crop circles, not a straight forward alien invasion complete with boogeymen creatures trying to drag off the children.  Mel's dilemma as he deals with his loss of faith and the impending disaster centers the movie, but I had difficulty interpreting his emotions most of the time.  He doesn't play a character in control, which is what you expect of Mel Gibson.  He's confused and angry and drifts through much of the movie with a blank expression, not seeming to know where he's going, which makes for an awkward story since no one else really picks up the slack.  Drama requires a hero, and that element is lacking in this movie.  The final scene where Mel puts his collar back on seems trite.",Signs

It bothers me to hear such bad remarks about this movie, only because people expect WAY too much from movies nowadays and it seems like with EVERY MOVIE there are always people that complain about how bad the movie is. I mean if you look in here on IMDB and look under the comments from people on your personal favorite movies, I can almost bet you that you will find some that don't like the movies. I've checked my five favorite movies of last year and the five oscar nominees and all of them have TONS of bad reviews of them, and I don't know why. But, I really enjoyed this movie, the feel of it, the look of it and to be simple: It was VERY scary.**Warning: Minor Spoilers ahead, please don't read if you dont want to know some key elements of the film, I dont want to spoil it for you**-Ok, first of all, if you want to see a film that shows guys chasing aliens around back and forth and so on, go see ""MEN IN BLACK"", because in this movie, the scariest parts are when you don't see the aliens.-One of my favorite parts in this movie, was probably the scariest part in the movie. Its the ""video birthday party"" scene. The reason why this part is so scary is because it seems so real. The look on the children's faces look frightened beyond belief and the camera moves just like an actual video taped segment.  This scene was so creepy, its one of my favorites in the film.I like how M.Night does NOT pander to the audience. He doesn't show us too much so we get sick of it, he shows us just enough, wanting more. If I can make one point of critique, I would ask that there were more scenes in the cornfield and the aliens, I enjoyed it so much, I wanted a little bit more, but all in all, this was a solid good movie.

239,RIK-22,Simplistic obvious and uninteresting,1,26 November 2002,"After enjoying the Sixth Sense and even though I seem to be in the minority, Unbreakable, I looked forward to latest M Night creation.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed.  Where as both Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were slow paced, they were at least intelligent leading to a conclusion that was in both cases was a surprise.  In this I knew the ending right from the moment you knew Mel's character had lost his faith.  Of course his wife's word would really mean something and everyone would live happily ever after.Further to this telegraphed, rather insultingly simplistic story was a very poorly realised Alien invasion plot.  The worst being the ludicrous manner in which they could be defeated.  If you could be killed by water I think you would have worn a raincoat.  Strangely there is moisture in the air so presumably they would have died in the atmosphere anyway.  This was even compounded further by the fact that the Aliens take Humans one at a time, all 6 billion of us.  That means you would need quite a few Aliens.Anyway as others have mentioned the main plot line for the movie was the re-discovery of Mel's faith, it's such a shame that it was presented in such a dull, uninteresting and patronising way.An indication of how bad this movie is, when I watched with others we found us all groaning out loud or putting our head in our hands at the stupidity of some of the scenes.  They were often so dull and just unintentionally silly, yet you knew the director was trying to get some meaning or tension out of them.1/10  How the mighty have fallen.",Signs

Night Shyamalan is as talented in creating a threatening mood and lead the audience to nail-biting scenarios as rarely anyone else in the United States. The scenes in the cornfield are some of the best in recent suspense cinema history and could easily have been in one of the best movies in recent history. If there hadn't been this other part in this film, meaning the past of Mel Gibson's character as a priest, the death of his wife and the way he slowly finds back a way to believe in god. In a horror film it is advisable not to show the threat, so the viewer has many possibilities to envision it for himself. You have to keep the possibilities open. For creating suspense, Shyamalan is well aware of this principle. But when it comes to the faith storyline (and also the resolution), Shyamalan ignores the many possibilities and serves religious hardliners.",Signs

No one would probably see a film like this unless there were some aliens involved. The director M. Night Shyamalan cast himself, not too convincingly, in a key role, while Joaquin Phoenix is simply too young to be Gibson's brother, but Cherry Jones is excellent as the town sheriff. Effective elements of producer Val Lewton's 1940s films, ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) and ""Blair Witch Project"" (1999) are utilized here, creating effective suspense and eeriness.

Yes, he does know how to make money and that's what it's all about. I've seen most of his movies, usually leaving the theatre or my TV thinking, why wasn't that better? ""Signs"" is clearly such a movie. He immediately grabs our attention with the ""signs"" in the corn field and slowly feeds us more info, building tension all the way. When the ""martians"" as I will call them, even though they undoubtedly came from billions of miles away, are playing cat and mouse, it's exciting. When more and more ""signs"" show they are probably hostile, we continue to wonder what will happen. And then we find out. Nothing much. It is so utterly unbelievable that an advanced race, at least technologically, would come all the way to earth to ""harvest"" us and walk around ""naked"" on a planet with 70% water, when water kills them. Stupid. They would wear some protective costume. It's also unbelievable that they could come all that way with no weapons. Hostile creatures have weapons to destroy enemies. They didn't travel all the way to the Earth looking for better scenery. They came to conquer us, with what? Their bare hands? This is really a silly plot. We don't even see them attack anything. We just hear them rumbling around upstairs, like burglars who dropped by. Then they leave mysterious designs cut into the walls. OOOOH. Scary. Then the big confrontation with the eight fingered nudie. Phoenix conquers it with a baseball bat! It could have been Neanderthal vs. Homo Sapien. The subplot (main plot) about the self unfrocked minister and his rejection of god, is just lame. His wife is killed when she decides to go for a walk in the middle of the night along a highway. Surpirse! A truck hits her. Well, that is unlucky, but maybe it would be better to go for a walk on your vast farm. So Mel blames god. OK. Blame him for having a stupid president while you're at it. Then when his son might die from the secret poison gas of goofy the alien, he prays to god and god saves his son. Pretty fickle this god. So he returns to the cloth.

Quite frankly, the movie started slowly, but great but in the mid part of the movie I was thinking that it was actually the worst movie of Shymalan. That was when the carpet was pulled from under my feet: as off the imminent attack warning, specially the ending and the basement sequence, I was shocked. I'm rarely scared in movies, but the reflection on the Tv screen near the end made me stop thinking. That only happened before with the Others. Than I knew, Shymalan didn't let us down. The whole suggestion of everything scares us. A lot. That's why Shymalan and Aménabar belong to the same school and restricted group of fear geniuses. Shymalan keeps his trademark, scary, suspenseful films with a major twist in the end. Sign's final twist is nowhere near as bombastic as Sixth Sense and Unbreakable's; but it is truly unexpected, and it isn't senseless.

What the message is remains unclear; supposedly it is about ""faith"", those who have it and those who don't. But the dopey end seems to mock Christian beliefs, leaving us with an entirely empty message with no point or reolution.Shyamalan uses film school tricks and ideas lifted from various other movies to build the tension, while trying to get us to emotionally ""bond"" with the farm family being visited by aliens. This direction is so obvious I sat there analyzing it more than feeling it. At the end what have we?

249,rooboy84,Potentially my favorite thriller.,7,30 August 2002,"This would have to be one of my favorites - if not favorite thriller movie i've seen. It's the second best movie of the year for me, behind AOTC. *SPOILERS* Father Graham Hess(Mel Gibson) and his family start to discover that they are not alone when mysterious things start to happen, like large crop circles happening in their corn fields, and dogs acting weird and aggressive. Then they start to see the extra terrestrials.
I admit this movie was very tense and scary at some times, because you expect something to happen every time they zoom in on the door or window, etc. I felt a fear like the kind of fear I feel in real life, which I haven't felt with other movies. Also the film has plenty of unexpected surprises around every corner, which adds to the thrill and fear of it.Before I saw this, i thought Mel Gibson wouldn't fit the role, but he did a great job, as he helped bring out the suspense in Signs. Rory Culkin was also great in this film. The special effects were very good, but could have been better, as it looked like the aliens fitting in with the surroundings about 75-80%. Although not much action, it makes up for that with everything i just mentioned.Overall not the best movie in general, but the best thriller I have seen.76%",Signs
250,hbs,"entertaining, thoughtful, but not ""The Sixth Sense""",8,5 August 2002,"Shyamalan manages to stay with his franchise (mystical and optimistic) without repeating himself. It's not a great movie, or even as good as ""The Sixth Sense"" (which I think is close to, but not quite, a great movie), but it is solid entertainment. I've seen complaints about the ending, but I found it fair and consistent with the rest of the movie.
Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix give strong, understated performances, and the rest of the cast is good (I found Shyamalan's cameo the weakest, but he's adequate -- it's just that the rest of the cast is very good). The Culkin kid gives a ""Culkin kid"" performance, but he was well cast so it works fine. And the little girl is as cute as a bug.I find it hard to write reviews of his movies since so much of the pleasure of the movie depends on figuring out what's going on. This movie has less of that than TSS or Unbreakable, but it's still part of the movie, so try not to learn too much before seeing it.",Signs
251,wjfickling,"Not suspenseful, not exciting, not logical...but well acted",4,9 July 2004,"Mel Gibson's powerful screen presence is the only thing that saves this dismal attempt at a scifi suspense thriller. We are intended to accept Gibson as a former priest (presumably Episcopalian or Eastern Orthodox, since he has been married and has children) who renounced his faith because of a personal tragedy.  Then we are to believe that he and his family being scared out of their wits by an extraterrestrial invasion will provide the impetus for him to regain his faith.  Well, maybe it would, but I think finding out that we are not alone in the universe would have the opposite effect on most people.There are several unexplained and illogical elements in the plot.  For example, why does his young daughter have a phobia about drinking water?  We know plotwise why she does, because all the undrunk water around the house comes in handy later in a plot device I won't reveal, but why does she have such a phobia in the first place?  Why does the mere unseen but suspected presence of the extraterrestrials cause a beloved family dog to become viscious enough to try to kill the little girl, forcing her young brother to stick a knife in him, and cause the other dog to be tied up, but appear to have no such effect on humans?  And what is Mel going to do with all that corn?  He lives on a one crop farm with acre upon acre of corn, but there don't appear to be any farm implements anywhere in sight, nor are there any hired hands.  Are Mel and his brother going to pick all this corn with their bare hands?Now let's get to the extraterrestrials.  They appear to be the most incompetent extraterrestrials ever to appear in a scifi film.  We are to believe that they have a technology sufficiently advanced to allow them to travel from another solar system light years away, with hostile intent, yet they don't appear to have any weapons with them, no ray guns, no laser beams, not even a pitchfork.  Moreover, one of them can't even get out of a locked pantry.  Maybe he was the doofus of the bunch, since he was one of the ones who got left behind.  The depiction of the extraterrestrials is also singularly unimaginative, since the only one we get a good look at appears to be wearing a rubber suit that looks like it's the same one worn by James Arness the ""The Thing from Another World"" back in 1951.But as I said, it's well acted by Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Cherry Jones, and the children.  Otherwise a ludicrous mess.  4/10",Signs
252,The_Dead_See,"Finally, a frightening movie!",7,3 August 2002,"This has to be one of the first movies in years to realize that the less you see of the monster - the scarier the experience. Although Spielberg's 'Jaws' employed this technique so well, most films these days took the other route - showing us the evil in it's full glory instead. As a result, in these films the fear factor is lost under mountains of animatronics or cgi.
In Signs, we are kept in complete suspense for the majority of the movie - An inhuman leg here... a flitting shadow there... Our minds do the rest for us. And it works fantastically.Signs takes the alien invasion plotline and examines it from a whole new angle. M. Night knew that he didn't need to show us huge ufo's blowing up the white house. Instead, he stays with one small family in one small town throughout. Our only link to the outside world is the occasional tv report. Yet still you get the sense that something terrible is happening in the world outside - all over the planet. And you feel closer to the action than you ever will in event movies of the same theme. When Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are trapped in the middle of their own house - with shadows of creatures moving past the windows looking for a way in - you are right there beside them. Because Signs depends so much on the emotional intellect of its audience, those with little sense of imagination will probably be dissapointed with its underplayed manner. But those who can't walk past an open doorway at night without conjuring some skeletal creature in the darkness beyond will probably find it the most frightening experience they have ever had.",Signs

The mediocre The Sixth Sense was interesting the first two times to watch, but after that the movie lost all replay value. Signs unfortunately has no replay value, in fact it has no play value at all. The film is hardly scary at all. The supposedly frightening moments may be scary to a 4 year old, but anyone of age that finds anything in this movie scary is out of their mind. One of the worst things about this film is the horrible cast. Mel Gibson does a good job, but Joaquin Phoenix doesn't fit his role well, Macaulay Culkin's kid brother is an annoying brainiac pest, and the little girl in the movie isn't cute at all - she's way too ""forced"" to act cute.

254,rcolgan,What a Twist!,4,14 May 2015,"There are different opinions of when was Shyamalan's turning point was in going from being called ""The Next Spielberg"" to his name being associated with bad movies and ridiculous twists. Some think it begun with Unbreakable and others his later films like the Village or the Happening. Personally, I've always thought it begun with Signs. Whilst it was received OK at the time, I've always seen it as a mess of a film with dull characters, mostly bland visuals and quite possibly one of the worst twist endings ever put to film. Just like any Shyamalan film the cast seems to suffer from extreme boredom. I say this because from the very start of the film they all seem completely detached from everything that's going on. For example early on when the family dog attacks the children, Mel Gibson's character just seems mildly distracted when he senses something up. Then the kids themselves don't act like they've been attacked but instead like they've just been mildly irritated by something. Ultimately it's a big problem for any drama, because if the characters don't seem to care then why the hell should the audience? It's not the actors fault as for some reason Shyamalan has repeated the same dull monotone style for all his actors ever since the Sixth Sense. The problem being that whilst in the Sixth Sense it was something different to what we'd seen before and worked to create the off- putting atmosphere, here it's boring and makes little sense when it's used in casual conversations. One of the things that bug me the most about Shyamalan's films is that he does tend to put some good ideas and concepts into his films, only to then ruin them. For example there's the aliens themselves. At first they are quite well done with Shyamalan making us fear what we don't see as we are put in the protagonists perspectives seeing only brief glimpses of the invaders. But then he screws it up because when the aliens are revealed they are completely unintimidating and created using incredibly ugly and unrealistic CGI. On top of that the way he has people react at first is interesting with people being very sceptical of whether aliens have invaded. However whilst this could be an interesting background for the story to take place in, it's forced into the foreground and focused on for a significant portion of the film meaning it gets dull pretty quickly.Obviously just like any Shyamalan film this one has a twist. But this film has not just one, but two of the most laughably implausible twists ever put to film. Firstly it's revealed that the invading aliens are allergic to water. Really? These aliens travel all this way across the galaxy and can be defeated by water? I'm assuming that Shyamalan was trying to go for something like what was done in War of the Worlds where the germs are the downfall, but it worked for that because the Martians had no concept of germs and never would have thought of looking for them. Water on the other hand covers most of the earth! Did the aliens never notice this when they were scouting the planet? These aliens were as dumb as the ones from Plan 9 From Outer Space!But that's nothing compared to the twist that god killed Mel Gibson's wife so he would know to tell his brother to hit the alien with the baseball bat. There are so many things wrong with this.... Firstly these are the weakest alien invaders ever. A single baseball team on a rainy day and their invasion is over. Secondly, if god really wanted to send a message then why did he have to kill his wife? That sounds more like the way the devil would send a message! And finally did they really have to be told to use the baseball bat against the alien? Honestly I would have thought it would be obvious! For me this is quite possibly one of the worst twists put in a big box office film just for its complete lack of any logic or sense. It's actually laughable that this story made it into a 75 million dollar film. But that's just what this film is. Hilariously awful. Honestly it was worth watching because it is one of those films that is so bad it's good. I'm rating it low because it fails at the drama and horror that it was attempting. But looking at it in the same vein as a film like Plan 9 From Outer Space it is pretty enjoyable.",Signs

I don't know how to spell his name so I will just call him the guy I will try to not give away anything from the movie so let me just say this; Mel Gibson plays a farmer and he lives on that farm with his family. One day there is some strange formations in his crop field, and this is where the story begins. Mr M. Night `something or another' has made a powerful and entertaining movie in `Signs'. The characters are well played and likable. Maybe there is too much drama for some people, but I really think that builds and holds the movie the entire time.

People complain that they look kind of goofy, but when I first saw it walking by the kid's birthday party on that news channel, I was almost screaming.  And the humor was a good mix.

One has the idea that M Night Shymalan might claim that is film is some kind of homage to these films, but that is nonsense. It is a load of tosh (English slang for rubbish), that is interesting, up to a point, all the time it is 'about' crop circles, and disintegrates into ridicule when it becomes an apocalyptic vision.

He lives with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), and his son and daughter (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin).  One morning, he finds crop circles on his farm, leading to a series of events involving the possibility of alien life forms.  I won't say the rest of it, as any more information may spoil the suspense.""Signs"" is the best movie made since ""Traffic"", not because of any deeper meaning, although there is one, but simple because of the sheer suspense and quality of filmmaking.  It is in a way, reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock, although I don't like comparing the master to any other filmmakers, no matter what I think of them.  The style of suspense building and character development shows the obvious influence Hitchcock had upon Shyamalan.Aside from the spectacular technical merits of the film, it is a well told story, with solid characters and an interesting plot.  The heavy handed way the questions of fate and faith are presented may turn some viewers off, but like them or not, they can't overshadow a fine piece of filmmaking.  The ""twist"" in the end, which isn't really a twist, but similar to one, is interesting but not impressive to the extent that the twist in ""The Sixth Sense"".  It certainly isn't the reason for watching the movie.""Signs"" is the best movie of the year, thus far, and is certainly an excellent addition to the resumes of M.

What high standards we've set for ourselves!To anyone with a little depth, ""Signs"" was clearly not meant to be a disaster flick or special effects showcase. The movie is more about a Man losing and regaining his faith in life, God or whatever. In many ways, the alien plot serves as a backdrop to the plight of the characters, though it's center stage all the while. I don't think the movie was meant to be scary in the usual sense. The uplifting soundtrack balances a sense of doom with a promise of hope.Almost the whole film is seen from the angle of an isolated farmhouse and its inhabitants, freeing us from the usual hype of command centers, bickering authorities and views of mass suffering. That's how any average person would witness an alien invasion; from their own porch. And that's what made this movie different for me.

Instead of showing a bunch of stories like what the president is doing about this, the army fighting the aliens, and showing hundreds of people running and screaming, this movie shows how most people would probably be experiencing this: at home, anxiously watching the news for information. There are plenty of suspenseful scenes that are scary not because of what you see, but because of what you don't see, and what you are afraid to see.Many people love this movie for doing this, others hate it for it. If you're a fan of movies full of alien carnage with creatures biting the heads off people and blowing up cities, Signs may not be for you. But like all of M. Night's films, it still makes a pretty good movie without the main concept. It's actually a pretty touching story about family, faith, and the possibility that there are no coincidences and there is a reason behind everything.

264,gila_film,Enchanting,8,18 February 2003,"with a title like 'Signs' and provocative trailer, we easily can dub this new film feature of M. Night Shyamalan, as an edge-of-your-seat-thriller. Well, it's a gripping thriller certainly, but just was not as we used to think of.Set in a rural area of Buck County, Pennsylvania, U.S., 'Signs' tells us about Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) that find a mysterious appearance of a five-hundred-foot design of circles and lines carved into his family's crops. His children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) thinks it was an alien works. Evidently, Graham doesn't consider it. He easily thinks it's a prank from the locales. The only person that aware about what happening is his younger sibling, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). However, when the crops around the globe showing the same phenomena, his faith is being tested once again and when the fate of his family as the stake, he must reveal what lies beneath the Signs.Sometimes, we have a certain difficulty whether we have watched a good or bad movie. The same wonder struck me when the first time I watched 'Signs'. I felt deceived by the trailer and promos (I even have an interactive CD-ROM). I thought I would encounter that another Hollywood summer blockbuster, but I was wrong, because it seems I have watched a lame and boring little thriller whatsoever. Moreover, because I was not satisfying enough, than I decide to give it a second chance. From my second encounter, than I realized what 'Signs' is really about. 'Signs' is about a man's journey of faith, presented in an enchanting suspense-drama. Mr. Shayamalan succeeds to build the tension that it needs. It is raising our emotion from the low to the high by step by step, until on the climax our emotion erupts to the expectation. The drama penned by Mr. Shyamalan given beautiful and moving touch. The suspense is very griping. The performance of Mel Gibson, Rory Culkin and even Abigail Breslin are superb and giving a huge contribution to the film's structure. Only Joaquin Phoenix hardly serve his role decently, because it seems he play it with an over acting way. Overall, 'Signs' is a beautiful drama portraying an ordinary people in an extraordinary situation. 'Signs' is a what-if, so don't bother to push your logical sense on it and you will get an enjoyable cinematic adventure.8/10",Signs

How dare you craft a piece of cinema so compelling, in this day and age when we have seen it ALL. How dare you subtlety tone your movie so it's emotional impact is thunderous? How dare you craft a film with real emotional resonance that doesn't use gushing music to cover it's hollowness? How DARE you defy the special effects gurus and show LESS and end up affecting the viewer MORE? How dare you employ the talents of the overlooked Tak Fujimoto as your DP and blow us away with beautiful visuals of relatively mundane things? I DON'T GET SCARED AT MOVIES. THIS MOVIE SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. If you haven't seen this movie, go get in line, and buy a ticket. It's worth every penny. !!!MAJOR SPOILERS!!! One of the best things about this movie is the way it shows how events affect and reverberate within a family. Parents: It shows how children ARE watching your every move.  They understand and absorb far more than you tell them, AND when you wish to keep something hidden, their little antennea extend that much further. This is all under the surface however, as Shyamalan bucks movie conventions by NOT hammering us over the head with his message. He's to smart for that and he doesn't insult our intelligence as an audience.Let's get this out of the way. This movie has an alien invasion in it. The film may even borrow from ""War of the Worlds"" or others of the genre. But the similarities end in the pitch. Rather, it's about a man's loss of faith, of hope. Ultimately it's about the pressure that loss has on his family. It's about the redemption that is only a leap of faith away for the most hardened atheist. Actually, that isn't strictly true. It's the relationship between a father (God) and his estranged son (Man).  M. Night could have slacked off and made a candy coated version. Most directors faced with profit concerns and annoying producers would have had to. He is far too serious an artist to do that. Let's face it...he makes his movies on one level for the many to enjoy and then he makes them on another level for smart people. He creates a tone and stays with it throughout the film. His subtlety isn't reminiscent of early Spielberg (as some have alluded) but more like Hitchcock. The title music could have been written by Lalo Schifrin. I haven't felt such an emotional connection with a main character since ""Vertigo"". Far too many films are made where one cares little about the fate of the characters, primarily because the characters fit some cookie-cutter role designed for ""stars"". The realistic use of humor in strange situations threw some reviewers for a loop. Perhaps they are more comfortable with a ""tongue-in cheek"" Tommy Lee Jones one-liner during a completely unbelievable conflict with aliens in ""MIB"". That's unfortunate. The humor in this film is the humor of everyday life, the peculiar and amusing incongruencies of people and human interaction.

I feel as though I kind of need to have spoilers in my review as the twist has me heated. I see some people defending it by saying they avoided water and they are made of a different chemical composition as opposed to humans but why would they be collecting life forms that are composed of 70% water? Make it make sense Shyamalan! You could've made an all time classic in the thriller genre, it's still worth checking out and if you gave the film a 6/10 or a 5/10 just for the twist sucking then you are ignoring the nearly two hours of entertainment before it. Don't get me wrong I loved the film still but I just feel they should've retconned the third act.UPDATE (1/23/2020): I have changed my mind about this movie. Originally I liked the Christian themes in this film with Mel Gibson being a priest once again at the end credits. Then I realized that upon thinking back to this movie the holy water idea makes a lot of sense because of what it means in the religion of Christianity I found these fan theories after searching online and I rescind what I said earlier about the water making no sense, it's still not perfect but it does make a lot more sense.

267,smashattack,Nice build-up that leads to a disappointing climax.,2,12 August 2002,"There is much more to Signs than the previews and commercials would have you think.  The creators of the film would have you believe it's this freaky movie filled with dark, tense scenes and scary encounters.Well, partly true.  Signs is not a nasty movie and not overly scary.  Some parts will make you jump, some parts will make you shake.  But I think the thing that satisfied me most about Signs was the total unexpected humor.This movie is hilarious.Instead of a sci-fi/thriller as displayed, I found a witty, funny, excellently built-up movie.  The movie has a quick pace at first, as the beginning is not only funny (Joaquin Phoenix's rude awakening) but also freaky and absorbing.  I was drawn into the movie after the opening titles.Speaking of opening titles, I should get to the music.  It is composed by James Newton Howard, who sets a delightfully chilling score that is not overly screechy such as Psycho's themes.  Instead, it has a nice balance between overly horror and underly boring.  The same theme is all throughout the movie, which can get kind of repetitive, but it's a very nice, creepy theme that suits the movie well.The actors a do a magnificent job as a family torn apart by a death and by certain encounters.  They are racked by family problems when these strange signs appear everywhere, making their not-so-normal life all the more stranger.Although the movie builds up well, it has a very disappointing climax.  I had an idea during the movie that it could have had a very nice plot twist (it all would turn out to be a hoax), but that didn't happen.  I was fine with that, but the climax was not a very good end after all this building up.  I did like how all the things came together in the end (watch the movie... no spoilers here!).For one thing, it seemed too much like Independence Day, but still maintained originality.Some things were left unexplained, like what was happening to the animals and what the aliens were really there for.  Those didn't make sense.All in all, a decent movie that can put you on the edge of your seat at times or cause you to burst with laughter or brim with tears (Graham's struggle for faith is one such moment).

Also, do not watch it alone, and do not watch it in the middle of the night, or in a cornfield! My score: 7/10",Signs
271,Lando_Hass,A great movie despite a crappy ending....,9,19 September 2002,"In Signs, Graham Hess suddenly finds odd shapes in his farm crops. He thinks that it's all just an elaborate scheme conducted by nerds, until his two children start acting odd. As the movie progresses, more and more eerie events occur, Graham now sees figures outside of his house at night, and odd looking figures walking around in his crop fields. His kids and his brother know that it's an Extra Terrestrial, but he still thinks that it's people playing pranks on him. Signs maintains a very charismatic, freakish tone to it. The difference between Signs and previous M. Night Shyamalan films, is that the Signs has more supernatural elements to it. In Unbreakable, there was no eerie tone to it, and in Sixth Sense, there was an eerie tone, but did not feature aliens, or anything related. The greatest part of Signs, is the fact that the film has a very unique and original plot, and the acting was pretty good. Mel Gibbson's plays as Graham Hess, a man who has recently lost his wife, and since then, he has also lost his faith in God. Mel's character has somewhat of a sense of humor. I think that the best part of Signs, was the odd looking aliens. Those were very spooky. I REALLY hated the ending though, everyone said that it had a complete twist in the ending, but it does not. Right now, M. Night Shyamalan has an unbelievably great reputation. Kudos to M. Night Shyamalan for making this piece of art. Great movie, very freaky ass, had great acting, REMARKABLE story, but a very bad ending. Overall, Signs is definitely great. 9 out of 10.",Signs

You think this is about crop-circles and aliens; and that's only part of the tale as well.What this is really about is losing one's faith. Losing love. Losing in general.The aliens, the crop-circles, the whole thing you see in the ads is just a decoy, a ruse if you will, to mask what's really going on.The ads say ""Don't see it alone."" I did. And everyone else in the theatre with me who was with someone didn't fare any better. We all saw the same thing.What we saw was a movie that was not as good as ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable,"" but was good on it's own merits. ...Well, except for the alien... That was a guy in a rubber suit and it showed.But again, the aliens were a mere backdrop; and a not very good one at that.""Signs"" is clearly better than many movies out there, but not nearly as good as what we *thought* it would be. That's what really saddens me. SO much so I have to give this the lowest rating yet for Mr. Shyamalan.""5"" out of ""10,"" and he gets those mostly for effort. True there are some jolts here and there, but that, in the end, just isn't enough for ""Signs"" to warrant anything more. I would have liked to see the movie I thought this was going to be.

For that purpose, writer & director Shyamalan, brings in all the mambo-jambo you have ever heard about aliens and aliens' invasion.The result is one of the most annoying, not to mention ridiculous, film in recent years. The more the film progress the more predictable it became and I , for once, couldn't stand it. Mel Gibson looks lost in the part and the expression on his face seems to say: what the hell am I doing in this film(well at least I got good money for it).

That seems to be the case with M. Night Shyamalan.  The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece. Everything came together.  One could identify with the characters.  Then came Unbreakable, a ridiculous comic book creation with cardboard characters at best.  Then came Signs, which I think should have been titled Unwatchable.  This wasn't a movie, it was a slide show, though I admire Shyamalan for being able to cram a 20 minute script into nearly two hours.  Watch the touching moments when characters search for an intelligent line and fail.  Wait for that heartfelt moment when Mel walks in on Joaquin and the kids to find them all wearing hats made of aluminum foil.  Sit pinned to the edge of your seat for the stupidest ending ever filmed.  And bring a book and a flashlight to pass the time during all the pregnant pauses. You'll need it to keep from falling asleep.",Signs
276,Soysoy,This time he's done it.... sadly not quite,7,21 November 2003,"I'm delighted to see that Shyamalan is indeed learning, evolving, and seems to have the right kind of ambition.I'm among those who disliked the 6th sense, because I found it too manipulating, full of cliches and contrived acting. And awful Hollywood syrup music (heeewwww!). But I recognized a talent, as the story was great and some of the direction aspects were very interesting and refreshing.I was looking forward his next opus, hoping this guy would improve, but obviously ""Unbreakable"" was mainly an attempt to make another hit, and despite the -once again- great story, it was quite a boring movie.This time we have something really interesting.First, we have the first really frightening movie since a loooong time.I wouldn't watch it alone, and very few movies have this effect on me. And no, the 6th sense was not one of them.Secondly, we have a tuneful, tasty and intelligent direction, that does not insult my intelligence by loudly pinpointing everything that matters. No, one actually has to be patient, observe and think about what's happening. This is meditative direction. I like it so much. Outstanding pace, served by a brilliant visual composition and perfect editing. The narrative is not ""illustrated"" by the movie like in 99% of modern productions, the narrative IS the movie and vice-versa. Aaaaah.This is where Shyamalan's ambition is clear, as this kind of direction is not aimed at the brainless and shallow modern audience. No, he wants to please those who think, who observe, who actually take the time to get into the narration and fill the gaps. Those who read books, or look at decent movies. So he's trying to escape the commercial hype around his first opus. Great.Then there is the acting direction. This is very clever stuff. OK he's been borrowing a lot, mainly from Kubrick (Shining) and the Coens (Fargo). Nevertheless, this work is really impressive. And miracle (;-)), Gibson actually played the game! Thanks God, he did! Maybe he was not really aware of what Shyamalan was doing with him, who cares as the result is here for us to enjoy. Phoenix was a pretty clever choice as he's a natural for this kind of stuff. He does know what it's about, and fills exactly the right space. I'm curious to see what will be Phoenix's next works. I think he should meet Cronenberg sometime.So Shyamalan seems to have made his choice: to be an artistic director, there with the Coens, Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch and others. Well he has good chances to succeed. But it seems he still has to gain more independance.Because I can't believe that he actually thinks that the way he uses music is near to adequate (from an artistic point of view). Please. The best parts are the ones without any music, and thankfully there are plenty of them. Good. But when there IS music, a much better one would be needed. We have lots of good movie composers nowadays, just pick one.And I can't believe that this incredible happy ending, with its pedestrian, dull moral subtext, is what he intended with this story that until then was packed with dense, clever, subversive subtext. I HOPE he did not. I HOPE he's going to gain more independance and become a real free artist. Then when he talks about faith, he'll do it HIS way until the very end of the story.I know there are a lot out there who'd love him to keep on making soapy, sweetened, viewer-friendly flicks like ""the Sixth Sense"", but I'm among those who are expecting much more quality, challenging stuff from such a talented person. Would ""Signs"" be... a sign that it's going to happen? Have faith ;-)!",Signs

I was hoping to learn more about the mystery of crop circles and instead all I got was Joaquin Phoenix watching TV in a closet and no real idea what the aliens were like. For example, how can these beings travel light years across the vastness of space and not be able to get out of a locked closet? Also Mel Gibson and Joaquin strike me as a strange choice to play farmers.Why were the aliens there? To take over all the farms? Water is deadly to them and yet they land on a planet that is covered in 3/4 of it. I would think they would want to stay away not to mention the fact that you never know when it is going to rain. I guess their technology missed that little part.",Signs
279,SPaS,The all-time second scariest film (after the Exorcist) SPOILERS,9,18 September 2002,"Yup. This one definitely worked for me. Found myself squeezing the handles white-knuckled most of the time. The idea is not that original (the TV-series ""V""), but I don't recall anyone using the signs-in-the-cornfields- idea before. Also directing and screenplay are brilliant- it's amazing how, in a production the size of this, little they invested in the aliens. And regarding, how such a tense atmosphere they managed to create. Let's see: all they needed was ONE guy in an alien suit for footage of about 4 minutes, and some grady, low-quality ""news-footage"" - of lights in the sky! Of course, in horror flicks often more is less, since what you CAN'T see is scarier than what you DO see and goes for this, too, for the last reel... but for horror-fans, here is a perfect example of minimazing the income and maximazing the outcome- ""The Signs"" is truly the work of an undeniable genius!P.S. Did anyone of you whiners think that it might of not been just the H2O that kills these aliens? Maybe it's the dissolved ions in it that are present on Earth (that is, in the 1)tap water of 2)Earth), or the pH... or the amoebas? (All that water in the glasses was more than 24 hours old)",Signs
280,Phantasm01,Masterful Low Key Horror!,8,30 June 2006,"It's interesting, I'd always liked this movie a lot, but watching it again after a 3 year layoff I finally see just how extraordinarily well done this is. I've watched a helluva lot of horror movies in the past 3 years, and watching this again I really see how it's on a completely different level from the vast majority of them. When it comes to creating a slow rise in tension and simply inserting the supernatural into the apparently real world 'Signs' has few peers. This relates to a small flaw, perhaps: Once we get to the climax, once we've seen all there is to see, the reality proves a little too mundane. But, the strength of the journey itself more than makes up for this slight anticlimax. This is definitely one of the very best horror movies of the new millennium.I've heard some complain that the film lacks sight of the big picture due to its exclusive emphasis on the central family but I think that's what really makes it work, what really makes it real. After all, who cares about the big picture? We don't experience the world as a city or nation, we do it as individuals. That and it just allows us to really get to know the characters, and for Shyamalan to create full, real characters rather than just having a pack of clichés in various cities spread out across the nation. (Like you'd see in something like 'Deep Impact', for example.) Phoenix and Gibson are both absolutely great in this film, particularly Phoenix. Gibson's Graham is a little to cold and distant for us to relate to him initially, so we really connect with Phoenix's Merrill first, though I definitely came around to liking Graham as the movie went on. They're both utterly naturalistic, and manage a real severe intensity in the most emotional scenes while still avoiding any histrionics. The two children, Culkin and Breslin, are fine. I'm always leery of children having prominent roles in movies, but Shyamalan largely avoids sentimentalizing them excessively (Morgan is kind of a whiny dork) or earning cheap audience identification. (In the scenes where the kids are in the greatest peril I identified far more with Graham then with the children themselves.) Certainly, this won't be to everyone's taste as it is extremely low key up until the very end. And I don't mean this simply in the sense that it isn't violent or gory; that's true of a lot of modern horror films. The film simply refuses to show you much of anything through out the vast majority of the run time. There's a lot of noise related horror, obviously, and it goes light on the jump scares. (More amazingly, some of these scare tactics were actually surprising. Even after having seen it a couple of time before a few years back a couple of these were slightly surprising.) The film uses a particularly classic setting, the old siege on the farmhouse a la 'Night of the Living Dead'. Again, the primary siege is just so impressive because it manages real intensity despite the fact that they show you virtually nothing. The true climax is less effective, but it's still fine and is necessary from a thematic standpoint. Many people have complained about the 'twist' in this film. I've got some news for you: This movie doesn't have a twist. Morons.In the end, however, it may be the human element that really makes this movie standout. It's just a very tragic portrait of a family that has largely fallen apart. I'll admit it, it probably goes a little to far a couple of times, but it also manages a few genuinely moving scenes, which more than compensates. (Particularly note the great scene of Graham and Merrill discussing fate late one night, and Merrill's confronting Graham after the invasion night and so on.) As I always say, I don't really insist that my movies have realistic or likable characters, but the very best ones usually do. And 'Signs' has got that. Furthermore, Shyamalan's dialogue is generally leaps and bounds beyond what you usually see in a horror film, and it's also really quite funny much of the time.I've heard a lot of morons complain that the aliens here don't behave in a realistic fashion. I had a long-winded rant worked out in my mind, but these people aren't gonna be convinced by that, or anything, as a matter of fact, so I'll just keep it simple: It's absurd to claim that the aliens in this behave in an unrealistic fashion because we, the viewer, don't know anything about them. There are an infinite number of potential explanations for why they act as they do, and 0 reasons to believe they would behave any other way. Any supposed logic you may have come up with relating to the aliens is irrelevant, because they are wholly of and within the movie. And perhaps more to the point, this comes with the territory. Complaining about the aliens in this film is like complaining about how hardly anybody has any guns in a contemporary martial-arts film.Yes this is a great film. Definitely Shyamalan's best in my mind, as of this moment.",Signs

282,JamieWJackson,some nice work dampened by a holey plot,6,25 January 2003,"The other reviews are right on the money: this film looks really good and has that Twilight Zone-like Shyamalan feel to it, but there really are some plot holes that will have you shaking your head and smiling when you stop to think about it -- which, in my case, was _during_ my first (and probably only) viewing.  One review I saw said the acting was terrible; I don't think so.  Another comment mentioned that the movie was a confusion between different genres of movie and the makers weren't sure what sort of movie they were ultimately trying for, and I think that says it best, and explains why the acting may have seemed poor, at least to some people or in certain places.There were some great shots in Signs, such as Graham's (Mel's) first initial glimpse of one of the aliens -- really spooky!  Great job.  I will also say the wife's death scene was dramatically compelling and I appreciated the emotional presentation of that event, including the faltering words of the female cop who gets the unenviable duty of explaining the situation to Graham when he arrives on the scene; she almost flubs her line, but that's exactly how real people would be in such a horrible situation: faltering and shaky.  Thanks to the editors/directors for putting that take in the final film.Buuuuuut... the best review of all put it simply: can't wait for the sequel when the aliens return with raincoats and crowbars.  LOL!  My thoughts exactly.  Nothing like having to trek alllllllll the way back to Arcturus IV (or wherever -- please no hate mail from astronerds that there is no Arcturus IV) for those little interplanetary raid materials that SOMEONE forgot to put in the ship, huh?

Night Shyamalan stumbles. ""Signs"" isn't a major misfire from this major talent, but it certainly misses its mark. This is the year's 2nd major dissappointment (Star Wars II ranking alongside of it). It is a beautifully mounted film with a great message that says that nothing is accidental. The shocks are ""Boo!"" B-movie variety, the acting is constricted by the weight gloom and doom yhat pervades the movie and I wonder if the X-Files hadn't been canceled if the aliens would have been available to work on this movie. Until the very end it never involved me emotionally the way Night's previous 2 movies had. The acting is a major problem. I felt that Mel Gibson (an excellent actor and a very powerful one) and Joaquin Phoenix were straitjacketed by their director. Their was really no catharsis. The buildup was never delivered. If this movie was ""CE3K"" we needed a mothership scene. If this movie was ""War Of The Worlds"" we needed a major destruction set piece. In ""Unbreakable"" Night pulled back from showing us a horrendous train crash, but he got a way with it because it almost began the movie. ""Signs"" doesn't give the big set piece that we so desparately awaited. A lot of things that ""Unbreakable""'s detractors said were wrong that movie are evident here. I also think that we needed to see Graham's wife's death in its entirety at the start of this movie rather than in flashbacks, because too late in this movie do you really feel his pain. A few months (or years) from now I think ""Signs"" will be viewed like Speilberg's ""1941"" as not being a bad movie but also as being a not very good one either.",Signs

288,WilsonLau,A very good movie!,9,19 August 2002,"My first thoughts after this movie is that finally this director has mad a good movie. For I have been quite disappointed at his previous overrated efforts. Thos of course were the very boring, one-punch movies, unbreakable and 6th sense, I disliked them so much that I don't think the deserved to be capitalized. However Signs on the other hand is a gem amongst a pile of dirt. Signs is a very effective tale of suspense, thrills and frights. First of all it relates to the viewers in that the characters and locations are very typical, small town folks that are easy to understand and relate to. Secondly it plays upon a common theme of someone watching you, someone of course that you don't see. Finally when you do see them you realized that you were better off before. It has a realistic portrayal of the reactions of mankind to an invasion of enormous magnitudes. There aren't laser beams everywhere with little space ships buzzing all over the place. The thing I like about it the most was that there wasn't any disgusting showings of over-patriotism that are common in such films as Independance Day, The Patriot etc. Such patriotism can induce vommiting. There aren't any over-the-top Power Ranger type action sequences. It does however just falls short of greatness. It does have a ending such as the other 2 films however the its not stupid like in unbreakable, and its not as predictable as 6th sense. Furthermore its not like ""oh, so its that way? Well..who cares?"" the ending does have significance unlike 6th sense where is just seems like the ending was not like ""so what? who cares if he's a ghost"".  9/10 well done.

289,Critical Eye UK,Signal Failure 2/10,1,2 April 2003,"WARNING: SPOILERS THROUGHOUT
An ambitious attempt to rework the traditional scifi theme of alien invasion into something more cerebral comes a cropper amidst the crop circles of a movie as over stylised as it is over wrought. The plot, centering upon a man of God who has lost his faith and must now regain it on a long night's journey of the soul, isn't new: Hollywood has essayed it in every imaginable genre, whilst Spielberg was at his eloquent best in the examinations of faith and obsession that underpinned Close Encounters'.
Signs' is in similar territory, and has an equally talented creative force behind it in the person of M. Night Shyamalan, the conjurer whose Sixth Sense' remains one of cinema's finest party pieces: daring in its contrivance, accomplished in its execution. After that though, Unbreakable' broke into a million pieces of disbelief, and now Signs' fails in every area where Sixth Sense' so brilliantly triumphed.Artifice and contrivance, so cunningly masked in Sixth Sense', are here all too embarrassingly obvious, helped in no way by the script's blatant defensiveness Gibson's remark about aliens unable to get out from behind pantry doors reeks less of humor as a narrative awareness that somehow, in some way, this script has to be rescued, and fast. The line is used to shore up the absurd proposition that a family living next to an alien landing site will therefore decide to remain in their house / basement rather than head for the hills  or, in this case, the safety of water, an element apparently injurious to aliens yet the presence of which upon our Earth is so visible as to make it appear blue from outer space. But perhaps in addition to a propensity for incarceration in cupboards, these aliens are myopic as well.In a role which requires him to be more alienated than any alien, Gibson displays a gamut of emotions that span the gap from A to B but leave the remainder of the alphabet untouched. This is not entirely his fault, as under-playing is here a case of permanent diminuendo: the central characters verge on near total eclipse from the very first scene, and do nothing to light up the screen thereafter. Embarrassment for all concerned turns to excruciation in the revelatory sequence explaining why Gibson has lost his faith: the dying wife scene mixes implausibility with risibility in so inept a fashion it's astonishing it was never left behind in the editing suite.Devoid of the visual flourishes that hallmarked Sixth Sense', and saddled with characters amongst the most unsympathetic ever to have been menaced by anyone/anything  ye Gods, they even leave their pet dog outside to be eaten by aliens, and then never remark on it --`Signs' is 100% clunker from beginning to end. That it comes from a 100% unique talent is all the more tragic. Mr Shyamalan has already shown himself to be one of the cinema's finest illusionists; here's hoping he can rid himself of the compunction to embrace big themes' (and a tonnage of sentiment) and get back to what he obviously does best: technical tour de forces of brilliant misdirection. Hitchcock's crown still awaits. . . Rating: 2/10.",Signs

Night Shyamalan.  Clearly, this guy should have NEVER quit his day job.The story develops (what little there is) exceedingly slow.  After 10 minutes I was shouting, come on get on with it, why are you dragging the inevitable out.  The slow thin plot development, would last another 30 minutes.The almost contact lens depth of character did NOT add to the overall effect of this film either.  ""THIN"" is the keyword to this movie.  Thin plot, thin shallow characters, thin dialogue...It all lead up to a very predictable movie experience.There were scenes in this movie that look like that might have been taken from the George Romero Classic, ""Night of the Living Dead!"" -- Only ""Night of the Living Dead"" -- did have a plot to it!  This thinly wired reconstruction, could only hope to aspire to such acclaim.The alien (note SINGULAR) in this movie looked like something out of ""Godzilla"" or ""Creature from the Black Lagoon.""  In other words, ""a guy in a rubber suit!""I thought this movie trivial and banal at best.  Mel Gibson is a fantastic character actor, BUT NOT IN THIS MOVIE.  This movie basically would sux the chrome off a trailer hitch.  I was surprised Mel would agree to film such a bedraggled piece of crap.  It can only mean one thing:  They paid him well for his less the spectacular performance.  Every actor has his high's and low's, and this certainly was not his best performance.  Of course with ""contact lens"" character development, you can't expect much.The ""ending"" did NOT resolve the conflict of ""are the aliens going to invade, and are they friendly"" question.  It ended quite abruptly, with no real ending at all.  Like I said the director, M. Night Shyamalan should NOT have quit is day job.Don't waste your money on this, its a piece of work from the get go.

VERY Interesting trailers that did not disappoint you once you sit in front of the big screen and watch it unfold.Everyone, including the Kids, were EXCELLENT!  What a different role for Mel.  At first it was hard to understand why he seemed obtuse in his responses to others- the Sheriff and his Brother.  Then you learn what he and his family have been going through and where he's coming from. 
The plot seemed slow at first then just rolled along.  You ask yourself where are they going with this?  Hoax, Spoof, or some new variation. M. Night did such a great job weaving this tail, doing some very convincing cameo work and what an ending.  No Big Sci-Fi Effects blockbuster.  A mind teaser and keep you on the edge of your seat experience.  Would  see it again gladly.",Signs
293,jessicartim,Lets invade acid planet... naked!,7,23 March 2020,"Lets make it clear - if you try to apply logic to this movie, you wont have a good time.
Aliens in Signs reacts to water like humans to acid. Yet they don't wear any protection, roam around in wet cornfields and grass... just just, don't think about it. Aliens are just plot device.
Rest of the movie is just very enjoyable ride, all the cas including children performs very well, the cinematography is great and Mel Gibson restores his faith at the end.
One of the better M.N. movies in my opinion.",Signs
294,muons,A slow paced thriller,6,7 July 2018,"The movie is about a reverend who loses his faith following the death of his wife in a car accident. All the actions happening in the foreground, i.e. aliens invading the earth, the family's fight against the invaders in their farm house, etc. are indeed a ruse that serve to mask the main theme which is about the reverend regaining his faith. Although the plot involving the depiction of the alien invasion and its aftermath is sketchy and plain silly, the movie gets away with it because the action is pushed to background at the end. The cast and acting are pretty good. The pace is somewhat slow at the beginning but the film gains tempo towards the finale. Its theme is certainly deeper than a pure thriller but its handling of the action falls short of satisfying the fans of that genre. On the other hand, the plot holes in the foreground events weaken the drama and leave unsatisfied those who'd like to see beyond the action, too.",Signs
295,victor7754,A despondent film with monotone dialogue and emotion,5,14 August 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS is plagued, as was his predecessor, The Sixth Sense with an X-file like mood. Scully and Mulder had to be searching that corn field. Emotions lie low in this despondent film. Let's face it, Shyamalan has a gimmick and it seems to work well with Bourgeois audiences. The film is very goofy on the most part. The film holds our curiosity but fails to deliver any punch.  It seems to be dwelling on some philosophical idea of the human condition in the 21st century. It explores the faith and family of rural America in a quick changing world.  A corn raised family residing in an Andrew Wyeth painting.The directing and lighting in the film fail to inspire any originality.  It leaves one to believe that Shyamalan was under contract to make another film; ""Oh, who cares...give them cheap alien gimmicks and a corn field....we'll get you Tom Cruise or Mel Gibson....it will make millions...""And it did....",Signs
296,KennethEagleSpirit,Not just good Sci-Fi.,8,20 May 2007,"But good drama as well. I like this flick. The plot line, the characters, both develop well. The continuity is good. The story holds your attention. Gibson in particular shines in his role, as do all the other players. Good cast. These things, along with a subdued musical score that adds to and doesn't distract from, and good photographic technique, all add up to a very entertaining piece of work. The plots, plural, string the thing together so as to provide an ending, singular, for both. If I explained that further I'd spoil it for you. I won't do that. This film deserves a look see. If you haven't seen it yet you ought to. You'll enjoy.",Signs
297,JAKastner,Believe that Good Movies Can Be Release in the Summer!!,10,23 August 2002,"After a string of failures at the box office for Disney like Bad Company, Reign of Fire, and The Country Bears, Disney is hoping this will be a sign of better things to come. M. Night Shyamalan has been described as the next Spielberg after the surprising success of The Sixth Sense in 1999 and the cult following of the 2000 film, Unbreakable. Now that he has conquered ghosts and superheroes, he now goes after aliens. Will Signs bring back the same success or better of The Sixth Sense, which debuted in the same weekend in 1999, or will it show the decline of the director's success?The story goes that a man by the name of Graham Hess, a former minister, has lost his faith after the death of his wife in a car accident. He soon finds that crop circles have appeared in his corn fields but dismisses them as pranks and nothing more. But soon the news from around the world shows the lights from alien space crafts and everything that we had feared about life from other worlds is coming true. An invasion by the life forms looks to happen and now Graham must find the faith within him which is the only way to save his family. The story, which was written by M. Night Shyamalan himself, is nothing but pure majesty. The plot mixes humor in well needed places and for the first time this year, I was scared more during a movie then I had ever been before. And I loved every moment of it. The story doesn't seem long or too short which is a great rarity among the modern feature-length films.Mel Gibson, who has starred in many great successful films like Braveheart, What Women Want and the Lethal Weapon series, is sure to have another huge hit with Signs. Gibson plays the role of Graham Hess down pat. He plays with so much emotion especially with the scene involving the last supper the family shares together before the alien invasion happens. The tears just stream from his eyes which made the scene just so perfect. The kids in the film were amazingly good. Some cute children will ruin a film but these kids played their roles perfectly making us laugh, cry and scared. Joaquin Phoenix has another great role after the success of Gladiator. You just cheer for him at the very end of the film, which I will not give away in this review. M. Night Shyamalan, who made a cameo appearance in The Sixth Sense, plays a much larger role in Signs and shows that his genius goes beyond directing and writing.Overall, Signs spells another huge success for director M. Night Shyamalan and actor Mel Gibson. This is the best movie I have seen in 2002 and one of the best films ever made. The scariness and the emotions go way beyond that of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. The music was perfectly scored by James Newton Howard who also scored The Sixth Sense, Dinosaur, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. The opening credit music set us up for the greatness to come and made the credits very interesting to listen to. There are so many things to love about this film that any problems seem ridiculous. Though the ending to the film, which I will not give away, was a bit cheesy but that is what Shyamalan intended. The Sixth Sense delivered a surprise ending but Signs gives you what you should have expected but dismissed it for some surprise ending. The movie is meant to make you think as a movie goer and it does that with excellent flare and style. Signs is sure to remain the top film of the year despite heavy competition from Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers later this year. Make sure you make it your duty to see this film. It would be a crime to miss it. You never know when life from other worlds may visit. You would like to be prepares, right? ;)My Rating: ***** out of 5 (A Perfect Score)",Signs
298,McFrogg,Scary movie made even scarier by the truth about real aliens,7,10 November 2017,"Signs is a very underrated horror movie, almost as good as The Sixth Sense. The actors all did a great job, and made the whole thing believable. Before I saw the movie, I had no idea how scary it was going to be. The part with the TV news report with the alien sighting is one of the most disturbing moments in a horror movie. I remember the hair standing out on my neck the first time I saw it. I still have trouble watching it. Probably because it feels like we're watching a real news report. And although I'm not a fan of jump scares, the scene with the alien hand under the door is pretty darn frightening.Even though it's a horror movie with aliens in it, it's predominately a movie about the loss and rediscovery of one's faith. The aliens could easily have been replaced by zombies or giant, flesh eating koalas. The aliens are just stereotypical aliens, humanoids without clothes. I suppose some people were disappointed by this, and perhaps wanted something like the xenomorph. Personally, I think they're way scarier than the creature from the Alien series...the xenomorph is like a shark, a dumb animal. The aliens from Signs are home invaders from outer space.Aliens have always been popular in Hollywood and in comic books etc. Most people like stories about visitors from galaxies far, far away. Star Wars, Avengers, Superman...they're usually portrayed either as evil invaders or advanced peacemakers.Scientists are eager to find life on other planets (SETI). Some of them have even gone so far to suggest that, since life here on earth seems to be designed, we must have been created by little green men. Other scientists have also speculated that we humans are a part of a computer simulation made by these aliens. Evolutionists desperately want to find aliens, as a way to discredit religion.Many people all over the world claim that they have seen UFO's or have even been abducted by aliens. It's certainly possible that many of them lie or suffer from false memories/sleep paralysis. But every single one? Unlikely. Something is really going on here.After years of researching the UFO/Alien phenomenon, most of the serious UFOlogists have come to the conclusion that these beings aren't really aliens from outer space at all. Abductees say that these beings can walk through solid objects, use telepathy, take over your mind...UFO's are known to change shape and defy physical laws. So what are they really? According to the well-known UFO researcher John Keel (The Mothman Prophecies): ""The UFOs do not seem to exist as tangible, manufactured objects...The thousands of contacts with the entities indicate that they are liars and put-on artists...""And it gets worse. Here's a quote from Jacques Vallee:""An impressive parallel can be made between UFO occupants and the popular conceptions of demons.""John Keel:""The UFO manifestations seem to be, by and large, merely minor variations of the age-old demonological phenomenon.""Whitley Strieber, an author who claims to have been abducted by aliens (the story was made into a movie based on his book ""Communion"", with Christopher Walken as Strieber):""It was hell on earth to be there (in the presence of the entities), and yet I couldn't move, couldn't cry out, couldn't get away....Of course they were demons.... and I couldn't get away.""The famous occultist Aleister Crowley told that he had contact with a strange being called ""Lam"", which he drew on a piece of paper. The being looks almost exactly like the stereotypical ""gray alien"" you see everywhere. Google it if you dare.This is all pretty disturbing, huh? And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Some (secular) researchers have even discovered that the ""aliens"" go away when their victims cry out for Jesus. Also, the ""aliens"" often tell abductees that they are our masters, that they created us. They want to be worshiped, and tell their victims that Christianity is false. You hear about these strange and disturbing UFO cults...members claiming to be in contact with a higher, alien consciousness. They believe that the so-called aliens are our saviors that will give us superpowers and save us from ourselves. The Alien/UFO phenomenon is closely linked to the occult.These entities have supposedly disguised themselves throughout history, usually based on our latest ""fads"". First, they appeared as pagan gods, then strange creatures like fairies etc. During the Victorian times, spiritualism that was all the rage. In our modern, ""scientific"" era, it's aliens. The aliens and UFO's have also altered their appearances based on how aliens are portrayed in popular culture. From human-looking aliens to grays, from rockets to glowing balls of light.I'm not saying that people like Keel, Vallee and the other researchers believe that aliens are demons. As far as I know, none of them have/had any religious beliefs. According their theories, aliens are something called ""interterrestrials"". But really...how is this any different from fallen angels?Does this mean that the aliens in Signs are supposed to be demons? Some fans have suggested this. They can be harmed by water (holy water), and in the end the aliens in Mel Gibson's house are defeated by God. The news report at the end say that the rest of the aliens were defeated by using an ""ancient method"", possibly prayer. If I remember correctly, this theory has been debunked by the director himself. They're ""real"" aliens from outer space. Anyway, the thought that so-called aliens really are demons makes Signs even scarier...(There's actually a documentary revealing the truth about aliens coming out this year, called ""Alien Intrusion"", based on a book by Gary Bates)",Signs
299,RolloTomasi,Indie-pendence Day,9,5 August 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan has made 3 films in 4 years that are all very different and yet, a lot alike. They're all somber, frightening, and heartwarming. They're each what used to be called 'slow.' But because of Shyamalan, audience expectations are changing. They're rediscovering what makes films appealing in the first place. They're being engaged, challenged. These 3 films (I don't even have to name them) have stayed within familiar film subjects, but turned those genres on their ears. Ghosts, superheroes, and now, aliens. He's taken all of these subjects and crafted supernatural thrillers around them. What he's done is not necessarily changed the story, but rather, changed the point of view. In ""Sixth Sense"" he finds the point of view from which ghosts are the most frightening, a child's. ""Unbreakable"" does a similar thing. What would REALLY happen if a kid found out his dad is a super hero? What if you were faced with the prospect that you couldn't be hurt? Shyamalan doesn't need to change reality in order for a super hero to exist. It's still fantasy but then, it's real. He makes it personal. Shyamalan achieves this by using a smaller stage. We need only see the story of David Dunn (Bruce Willis) dealing with this curse and turning it into a blessing (see also Cole in ""Sense"").  Compared to the larger story ""Signs"" is a cross-section of, the film's stage is even smaller. The world is about to be attacked by aliens, house by house. Where else to put the camera then, asks Shyamalan, than in one of those houses? For the most part, this is where he keeps it. One major reason ""Signs"" works so well is that audiences have already seen the larger story in countless other special effects-driven alien invasion films for decades. Shyamalan says, hey that's great but, how would we REALLY react to an alien invasion? What's scarier, a city-sized spaceship over downtown or the frozen graphic on your television set that says stay tuned?' Leave it to Shyamalan to think of it first, to encapsulate what makes an event really huge, when the fate of the world really hangs in the balance: CNN goes off the air. All he had to do was show Mel Gibson looking ominously at a television screen.
Shyamalan is a director who understands how to use the craft. He's been compared to Spielberg, not for his penchant for making blockbusters, but because he seems to understand better than most current auteurs how to really make an audience respond. Like Spielberg's older work, M. Night's films have changed the way audiences see movies. It's the element of surprise, stupid. It's where you move the camera and what that camera finds. It's not always what's in the frame but what is just outside of it. Sometimes just holding the camera stationary on, say, the top of a staircase is scarier than anything else you could put in front of it. Shyamalan limits his story to a small cast of characters, a short period of time, in a small town. He keeps it simple. As always he rewards the audience by trusting it. This director's effectiveness lies in his ability to reach an audience that's seen it all. Well, not if M. Night has anything to say about it.Grade: A-",Signs
300,huggy_bear,A+.....Would watch it again.,8,23 January 2003,"I have to admit, I was really skeptical about this one, but I rented it and loved every minute of it.  I'm no science-fiction buff, but the suspense and the acting were superb.  Never will I bore anyone here and go over every single scene of the movie, but I will say that hey, if you have an imagination, rent it.  If you are one of those ""prudes"" where everything has to be perfect, stay away.  This is good entertainment, and I would recommend this to anyone.  Oh, by the way, the people who bash this film, well they probably would rather watch Yentl....go figure!!!!!!!!!!",Signs
301,evilmatt-3,Aggressively bad,1,11 August 2002,"That's right. Unlike many bad films, _Signs_ is not content to merely be a lesser example of what we call film-making; it seemed to me that this film was actually trying to hurt me. To say it in the nicest possible way, M. Night Shyamalan is a terrible director. He has no sense of mood or timing, cannot structure a cohesive plot to save his life, and can't scare the audience without resorting to cheap sound effect tricks. The humorous elements, which should be cathartic, instead make the film choppy and unbelievably annoying. The philosophy of the film has all the depth of a puddle and only pays lip service to the idea that films should have some sort of thematic cohesion. This movie fails to be interesting in any way, shape, or form- at least _The Sixth Sense_ kept us engaged before hitting us with an utterly absurd ending.My attempts to articulate just how bad this film is fall fantastically short of conveying the experience. Thus, I have made a list of unpleasant things I would do instead of ever seeing this garbage again. I would:papercut my eyelid - lick soiled toilet paper - eat a bug - be peed on - intentionally place my hand on a hot stove - get a nipple pierced - lick a flagpole in the middle of DecemberOh yeah, one other thing: after seeing Mr. Shyamalan in a too long dialogue scene with Mel Gibson, I can add insult to injury- he's a bad actor too. Do us all a favor and stop trying to be Alfred Hitchcock, okay?",Signs
302,Blackace,"Better Then Unbreakable, But Not Scary.",9,14 August 2002,"Well..I'll have to say I liked this better then Unbreakable. I thought Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job acting in this movie. I do believe the movie was a little misleading, as most people thought this movie would be about crop signs, but instead it was more about a family becoming stronger and a man believing in fate and his faith. The humor and suspense pretty much carried this movie through. They worked hand and hand, and kept you wondering what would happen next. (*Spoilers*) Once the alien was shown though, the suspense wasn't as high and I think the audience really wanted to see what was happening outside and around the town. The ending left a lot of things unexplained. Why did the aliens come and what had happen around the world. We only know that water hurt them and the military drove them away. The movie was still entertaining. I don't think it was boring (see The Time Machine..now that's boring). Thought there could have been more to the story then what was provided. Definitely worth a look.",Signs
303,FilmFan777,Better then II not as good as I,7,9 August 2002,"(A couple spoilers so....) Seems most 'really' like this film however I have too many checks that put it down the list. I hope M. takes a back seat on putting himself in his films. The more he's there, the more of a distraction he is. He's not a good actor by any means however he's not bad yet a distraction. I believe if he drops the production side it will strengthen his directing and writing. Yet if he went a step further, I'd like to see what he does simply directing someone elses story and production. Beleive this would show more of what I believe he has. That said, the film was pleasurable in some areas yet weak in others. Phoenix was, as usual, strong in his performance. In fact he and the lil girl were the standouts of the film. Mel, as much as I love him, was average if not below, Mel. Story was interesting for a change and thought it flowed fairly well yet dragged in a couple areas. Some humorous points, a bag or two in fact while still having some spooky aspects about it. For me, it got a bit weak when the (Spoil) Aliens came a knockin. Just didnt connect for me. I didnt 'feel' the threat, I didnt believe the newcasts, I didnt fear anything. Just wasnt put there ya know? I felt like I was watching it from a distance and 'knew' everything was gonna be allright. I mean, this alien is smart enough to travel the universe but stands there while the Babe Ruth could have been, grabs his link to who he once was off the wall, winds up for what seems two minutes and lets him plummel him? They're smart enough to get here, check out fields all over the world yet what is their lethal achillies heal, know nothing about? Like...it 'RAINS HERE AND IF IT EVEN TOUCHES US, WE'LL DIE' Sooooo......why would I fear them? Sorry, just didnt knock my ball outta the park.So, over all it's surely above average but nothing special. Worth the price of the ticket at least. Surely not a Frank Darrabont Shawshank Redemtion or even a David Fincer Fight Club directorial magic. And I believe he can. Less will give you more M.

304,FilmLabRat,confused but profound,9,19 September 2002,"film explores interesting themes and issues of personal struggles and growth (& faith).  The director is brilliant in building suspense and telling the story without showing much (ie: aliens) - constant surprises and chilling moments - but the ""horror"" elements seemed overdone and ridiculous at times.  I wasn't sure if I was watching a serious drama, sci-fi or a teenage slasher film.  In the end, the messages and important questions raised were heavy and excellent, saving the film.",Signs
305,mhubbard-54657,One of my very favorites,9,23 September 2018,"If you are looking for a traditional horror film, or an alien invasion, then this movie will likely greatly disappoint. This film is about faith, family, and the twists and turns of life. Mel Gibson does an amazing job of playing a former minister who left the calling after his wife was killed in an accident. He couldn't wrap his mind around a loving God allowing it to happen. He lives with his brother, played by Joaquin Phoenix, who has also been dealt an unfair hand in life. Suddenly, events test them both and the terror is chilling and palpable.Everyone is excellent in this film. The children, the woman who plays the sheriff at the accident scene, all excellent.Ultimately, this is a film about faith in God. If you believe that there is an underlying spiritual reality, that our ordinary lives hold a higher purpose, you probably will enjoy this film.If you do not believe in these things, you will focus on plot holes like the aliens being afraid of water, and you will find this film boring.",Signs
306,frankiehudson,Electrifying alien moment,8,28 March 2003,"This is a great little low budget film with a supernatural theme yet not too over-the-top.For me the best moment is when Merrill Hess (Phoenix), who is highly sceptical, is utterly horrified when he sees on television home video of an alien fleetingly passing the back window of a house.  Accompanied by Hitchcock-style music, this moment was truly shuddering, even more so if you're watching it in the dark!  This will make your hairs stand on end, like a cat seeing the biggest beast in the jungle.  Oh, it's awful!Interesting film and well worth watching.",Signs
307,crypticcrytic,Do you read signs?,6,11 August 2002,"The ability to read signs, if I understand the storyline, is inversely proportional to the potential to do something about it. First the dogs, then the kids and finally the adults woke up to the approaching menace. But isn't the ability to read signs what a successful life is all about? That is, reading signs rather than only seeing coincidences. Perhaps I should have read the signs: 1.	An over-promoted movie, 2.	An incredible difficulty in writing a commentary, and 3.	A movie associated with corn.Okay, the 3rd one was a stretch but the first two are real.
We've all learned to be skeptical with M. Night Shyamalan 's films after the sleight-of-hand he pulled in ""Sixth Sense."" Midway through this film he reminds us of distractions and to keep our guard up. What comes is more a message to keep the faith, know that everything happens for a reason and ""calm down and eat some fruit.""Periodic infusions of humor break the tension without seeming too forced. The soundtrack builds suspense right from the start as the dogs sense the unknown terror and two cute kids' insight advance the plot (thank god!) But why do I feel like I'm watching an old ""Twilight Zone"" plot?This film is one of the several big father-son relationship films? Here we have a family recovering from the loss of mom with a father dealing with his son in need of support. Gibson's character is in the middle. He's reconciling with God, the Father as well as his wounded son. He's dealing with forces beyond his comprehension - and, obviously, so am I. Add to this ""The Road to Perdition"" and the ""Minority Report,"" all in one summer! What's the message behind this recurring theme? Has it anything to do with Dubyah and George the Elder?  Passing the torch? Burying the hatchet? Forgiving? I think M. Night Shyamalan is riding on his past success. Watch for the signs.",Signs

Or the crop circles supposedly seen from a window yet are a long way down the field of tall plants. The aliens looked exactly like the Roswell alien-have these people no imagination.

309,mfisher452,Not much awe or mystery here,2,24 May 2005,"""The man who invented the telescope found out more about heaven than the closed eyes of prayer ever discovered."" -- Robert G. Ingersoll.This film reminded me of late 1999, when all the lunatic fringe fundamentalists were preparing for the End of Days. Would a God really schedule Doomsday using something as human and arbitrary as the Gregorian calendar? I wondered what all those boneheads would do when January 1, 2000 rolled around and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED except one more rotation of the Earth. They seem to have crawled back into the woodwork where they belong. That's what this film does: Starts out not with a bang but with a loud whisper and then ends with a pathetic whimper. Roger Ebert gave this film four stars, but he has never been too reliable about films dealing with Christianity, medicine or sci-fi. Never mind starting with a bang and ending with a whimper: Signs starts out small and then fizzles entirely. You think that it is leading up to some truly great ending, but then the film takes refuge in cozy, bland, reassuring religious platitudes that contend that there is a Purpose To It All.The story of extraterrestrial contact has taken many forms: Orgies of outrageous xenophobia like The Invaders from Mars or Independence Day. Cautionary tales such as The Day the Earth Stood Still (philosophically interesting but scientifically awful). Voyages of transcendental wonder like 2001, Contact and Close Encounters. And on and on. Signs tries to take a different approach, but suffers from a massive failure of imagination.Some things about this film I like. For once, a sci-fi film isn't a wretched excess of techno-violence. It takes place on a farm in Pennsylvania. There isn't a computer in sight. You see and hear a lot of wood: Boots and shoes clomping on wooden floors and verandas. Nature is never far away. The house looks like it's really lived in, by people of modest means. There are no damsels in distress or tough-talking Amazon weapons experts. The actors, as in all of Shyamalan's films, try hard for non-acting. Compare Mel Gibson's performance in this film and the Lethal Weapon films and you'll see what I mean.But wait: Was Graham (the Gibson character) both a farmer AND a minister before he lost his faith? His cornfields look awfully lush for being those of a former non-farmer. Not that he seems to take much interest in his fields. Also, where is the barn? Where is the heavy equipment? Where are his workers, if he has any? When the crop circles appear in his fields, no one shows up from the government or the media. Maybe that's not too far-fetched, but after it becomes clear that the crop circles may well be harbingers of an invasion from space, wouldn't you have troops with weapons and federal agents all over your farm? And these aliens: Would an alien who could easily get onto your roof and nimbly elude capture by two men in good physical condition really get caught in a bathroom, unable to get out? Would aliens who can cross space be so baffled by ORDINARY WOODEN DOORS? Why would an alien in your living room just stand there, not trying to get away or strike back, while you swung a baseball bat at him? Would an alien with evil designs on humans, e.g., to kill and eat them or drug and enslave them, really venture out onto an alien planet alone, unarmed, and WITHOUT A SPACE SUIT? Wouldn't they move in groups and carry weapons? Would an alien hungry for human flesh, and able to assimilate terrestrial protein, really find plain old tap water so toxic? Would aliens who found tap water so toxic really have designs on our planet, which is, after all, kind of a wet place? If aliens really wanted to abduct people for their evil purposes, why would any be out in the middle of nowhere in sparsely populated rural Pennsylvania instead of zinging a transporter beam onto a street in Bombay or Bangkok and netting a couple of thousand beggars? Maybe he was an E.T., a lone alien accidentally left behind, but this film neither answers that question nor even asks it. There are probably those who would reply that that isn't the point, that the real story is about the human characters in the film, but as I see it, if the whole plot is absurd, from beginning to end, how can the character studies make any sense?I can imagine how much this film appealed to Mel Gibson because he has extremely primitive religious views. He is a member of a small Catholic sect that rejects the liberalization of the Catholic Church that began with Pope John XXIII and Vatican II. Maybe that explains his massive victim complex. Look at his films: With some exceptions (e.g., What Women Want), he tends to play deeply wronged men who are taking revenge, to wit: the Mad Max films, Payback (!), Conspiracy Theory, The River, Braveheart, Ransom, The Bounty, etc. Few recent films have been better than ""Signs"" at taking the awe, mystery and grandeur of the universe and trying to squeeze it into a little religious box created by superstitious primitives who lived a couple of thousand years ago.",Signs

311,comquest,My Favorite Sign of All,4,11 July 2002,"Last night I attended a screening of 'Signs', the latest motion picture written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan ('The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable').  I looked forward to seeing it!  The trailer, already airing on TV, portrayed the movie to be a very exciting sci-fi thriller.Mel Gibson stars as Graham Hess, a former reverend whose wife was killed in a grisly car accident six months earlier.  After that, he quit the ministry and abandoned all belief in the existence of a higher being.  The supporting cast includes Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin and Cherry Jones.  All turn in good performances.The movie opens with the discovery of giant crop circles in Hess' corn field.  Who made them?  Do they have some profound meaning, or is it just a prank?  Without exposing the plot, I will tell you that the crop circles are just one of many 'signs' that lead the characters toward the conclusion.Some early scenes have a good sense of humor, taking full advantage of Gibson's wry wit.  The funniest involves Phoenix, Culkin and Breslin in silly tin-foil hats.  But the film is frequently as dull as its dark lighting and subdued atmosphere.**** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****At one point, the screen goes totally black -- for what seems like an eternity -- while noises are heard.  Then, a face is illuminated (chin up) by a flashlight beam.  For a split-second, I thought I had stumbled into a rerun of 'Blair Witch' by mistake.  But no, this was just one of several scenes that mimicked other films a bit too closely.  I spotted near-perfect renditions of scenes from 'War of the Worlds', 'Field of Dreams', 'Children of the Corn' and others.The scariest moments are the classic 'bump-in-the-night' variety.  Special effects are nearly absent unless you count the alien, who looks like a tall man dressed in two-dollar spandex tights from a Halloween close-out sale.Yet, the film is spellbinding because you constantly feel as though something really extraordinary is about to happen.  Unfortunately, the anticipation is never rewarded and the story ends suddenly with a disappointing and unsatisfying conclusion.  (As the credits began to roll, I stared at the screen in disbelief.)'Signs' is really not the movie portrayed in the trailer.  The sci-fi story you came to see -- dealing with extraterrestrials and crop circles -- is merely a subplot to the internal, spiritual strife suffered by Hess (Gibson).  Sci-fi is simply a colorful wrapper used to conceal the movie's true focus:  a ponderous message about human spirituality.That brings me to my favorite 'sign' of all.  It was bright. It was red. It had four letters.  They read: 'E-X-I-T'.  So I did.As I filed out of the theater, I overheard several conversations expressing the same sense of disappointment that I was feeling.  A teenage girl, talking to her girlfriend, said it best:  ""Well, I never want to see that again!""Ditto.",Signs

313,Blazehgehg,"Almost, but not quite",7,22 June 2006,"There's quite a stigma surrounding M. Night Shyamalan's directorial style. At this point, he's made more bad movies than good, and for many people, it was Signs where he went off the rails.That is definitely true.But here's the deal, okay: for the first, say, 90 minutes of its 106 minute run time, Signs is actually a really, legitimately good movie. It very slowly builds a fantastic sense of dread. You feel intimately connected with these characters. The small, tiny glimpses you get of creatures are genuinely frightening.If all you ever saw was the first 90 minutes of Signs, you'd be convinced that M. Night is an under-appreciated genius. I unabashedly LOVE those 90 minutes.But then you get to the last 10 minutes. The movie goes to pull the brakes, and the lever snaps off. What follows, obviously, is a trainwreck. The movie gets to its ""message,"" the trademark M. Night ""big twist,"" and it is absurd and convenient to an almost offensive degree. Every shred of good will built up by this movie is obliterated. There are no survivors. The last 10 minutes almost feel like they fell out of a different movie.But it's not from a different movie. Signs alludes to its forthcoming narrative suicide all over the place. It might ""make sense"" in the context of what the movie is obviously trying to say, but that doesn't mean it is any less ridiculous.I want to love Signs. I almost kind of do, still.

(this may have SPOILERS)After being disappointed in the third installment of Austin Powers, I needed to restore my faith (no pun intended) in movies and alas....SIGNS! GOD BLESS IT!Although not a perfect film, (I had a little problem with how funny the aliens looked) Signs was utterly enjoyable.The cast was awesome, especially the children and the pace was a much improvement from the director's ""Unbreakable"", which felt slow and monotonous.SIGNS works because the story continues to move forward while inserting humor in almost every scene. How a thriller about aliens and the possible end times can handle humor so nicely is amazing to me.  It's a tricky balance and this talented director/writer pulls it off.This movie gets its audience TO THINK.  I hope people won't shrug it off as being a movie that promotes any particular faith. The catholic wardrobe, I believe, is for visual effect.  The man of faith played by Mel Gibson, could have been ANY FAITH. It was SYMBOLIC. He was ALSO A MARRIED PRIEST-so get the hint. This is not a movie about catholicism. No mention of God is even presented. The audience must fill in the blanks. THEY ONLY MENTION HOPE AND FAITH AND PRAYER. I am a Christian, and I can appreciate the writer's ability to want to have faith in something or someone bigger than himself. We could all use a little faith.

316,villard,Space Oddity,1,22 February 2003,"(Caution: spoilers)In 'Signs"" writer/producer/director M. Shyamalan attempts to merge Hitchcock and H.G. Wells into a spine-tingling story about a extraterrestrial invasion of earth, as experienced by a Pennsylvania farm family. The pre-release Hollywood hype about alien-carved 'crop circles' (as so well documented in supermarket tabloids) tries to make the film more relevant and spooky than previous 'monster space invaders' flicks. Despite all this hype and Mel Gibson's acting, this insipid film flops miserably. How did Gibson ever fall into this black hole of a screenplay? 'Signs' serves-up an embarrassingly numbskull science fiction yarn and pretty anemic horror. It's mostly a lot noises and shadows, and those pesky crop circles just sitting there, but little else. The film's fleeting glimpses of the 'jolly-green' alien fleeting around the farm like Bigfoot, is about as scary as a kid putting on a white sheet and yelling 'boo.'There have been so many space monster and horror creature films, Shyamalan can't help but copy elements from everything from 'Poltergeist' to 'The Thing.' But the story line just keeps heaping absurdities upon absurdities. For example, any real farmer would get his pitchfork and shotgun and go hunting for any aliens lurking around his farm and flattening his corn (as in the hilarious vignette in 'Back to the Future' when Michael J. Fox first makes a crash landing in 1955). Instead, Gibson and brother played by Joaquin Phoenix just whine about the end-of-the-world coming. They then board-up the house, just like in 'Night of The Living Dead.' In that cult classic film there are dozens of seemingly indestructible wicked zombies.But in 'Signs' all we finally get to see is ONE clumsy alien, who must have gotten sidetracked from the invasion force. He turns out to be the first movie character since the 1939 Wizard of Oz's wicked witch to be killed by water! Now, think about this. The alien invaders are smart enough to travel countless light-years across space but don't realize earth is the only 'water planet' in the solar system. Duuuh! What's more, any middle school student who has ever done a research paper on astrobiology will tell you: no water = no life, even if it has three eyes, three toes and is polka-dot. Artistic license aside, this idiotic premise sets back science literacy by 20 years.Shyamalan should go find his boyhood 8mm movie camera and go back to making student films until he gets in right. A copycat film that is as dumb and uninspired and this deserves an 'F'. It is such a drawn-out bore, even the gang on 'Mystery Science Theater 2000' would have trouble staying awake to mock it.",Signs

319,ks4,"Intense, but not quite as atmospheric and thrilling as Shyamalan's other works.",7,14 May 2004,"SignsGraham Hess is a former priest, who has lost all his faith in god when his wife died. Now he is living with his 2 children and his brother, they're living outside a small town running a farm. One day ""Signs"" starts to appear in their crop fields, at first they think it's made my local people playing a joke on the, but as they watch the television similar ""Signs"" starts to appear all the world. While this is going on Graham Hess is continues to struggle with the death of his wife and her last words ""Tell Merril to swing"" and ""Tell Graham to see"".I am a keen admirer of Shyamalan's amazing talent to build up an intense atmosphere in his movies, especially ""The Sixth Sense"" gives a fantastic view into his perfectionistic feeling for movies. And while this movie is still an admirable effort, it has more flaws than the other Shyamalan movies i have viewed, it's not nearly as thrilling and the awaited twist is a bit sloopy, but the movie is still very intense most of the way. And it does have a lot of Shyamalan's trademarks, i just think that the story itself is not nearly as engaging and interesting as the others, i think Shyamalans twist is also more predictable and expected than in his other movies, there are simply revealed too much for it to really shock. You see some of it coming most of the way, but there are still some things in the end that does indeed make other things in the movie make more sense, but it's nowhere near as powerful and outstanding done as in his earlier movies, but this is still a highly original movie that brings what one expects.I am sure that this is also one of the movies that will divide the general public opinion, the movie can really be understood two ways. Are they all living in some sort of dream? Or is the movie about faith in god and the fact that everything one way or the other, does indeed happen for a reason. I believe in the 2nd. My primary reason for this is that the movie just doesn't make sense if you understand it as a dream, too many things are revealed and too many things wouldn't make sense. If there were only 4 characters in the movie it would make sense, but there are many more, and it would all be too realistic for it all to be a dream. However the 2nd thing is what seems more real, and also what makes most sense, and i have a strong confidence that it is what Shyamalan wanted to say with this movie. ""Never lose faith, everything does happen for a reason"".The directing is definitely strong here, i think Shyamalan have once again proven that he is one of the most talented and interesting new directors, and i do look forward to seeing his new project as i find his style very engaging and interesting. Also i think he has his own style which is good, you can feel that its Shyamalan that have made the movie, and the original feeling he brings adds up for a good experience in watching his movies, he is really good at creating an intense atmosphere in the movie itself, even if it doesn't work out as well here as it have done in his other movies. But who can blame him, Sixth Sense was almost a definition of a perfect thriller.Another thing i have admired Shyamalan for earlier is his apparent skill to make child actors seem so reliable and realistic in their way, a place where many fails because children naturally aren't very experienced and generally also more immature and nervous, but this is the 3rd movie in a row where Shyamalan makes all of his cast play some very convincing roles and there is hardly ever a flaw here. Especially Joaquin Phoneis is fantastic, and i will always have the image of him with the helmet on burnt inside my eyes.To sum it all up a bit, i am as said a big admirer and fan of Shyamalans special style, for me he is one of the best directors i have seen since Carpenters early days in building up an intense atmosphere, and even though this movie doesn't come close to the perfection of The Sixth Sense, it's still a solid and thrilling movie that will surprise you, even if you think you have the ending predicted. 7/10",Signs

I have to warn you, on each viewing this film will make everyone to ""FALL in LOVE"" with the Story!Signs(Spoilers******) Indian born director M. Night Shyamalan takes his next boogie venture this time his story revolves round the strange circles appears on the corn fields. Ex-Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is now interested on agriculture after his wife died on a car accident. Giving up his belief on God, Graham is living a new life with his two children and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix). One day he finds some strange circles on his crop fields, soon realizing that it's some kind of Alien signs. Why such signs appear on his field, does it have any thing to do with his past days? Scripted by M. Night Shyamalan himself tells the thrilling story of Aliens intrusion with a backdrop of strange crop signs. As always Shyamalan movies have something to say, it also gives messages like all Things Happens For Good, Believe in God. Mel Gibson was tremendous in portraying the torched family man. Gladiator-Joaquin Phoenix did an outstanding performance as Gibson's younger brother, whenever he was on screen the viewers get some relief, he was best in creating a pleasant atmosphere in an art movie. Plus the other person who steal the show was little girl Abigail Breslin, she was a an angel in the movie, but the boy Rory Culkin sucked his part by portraying a Too serious 10 year old.The camera works were good also the masterful editing. Credit goes to works of Tak Fujimoto and Barbara Tuliver. Last but not least the soul for Signs created by James Newton Howard makes this movie a cult classical one. Such a thrilling hunting Disturbing score that pushes Suspense and Pace in a well balanced way is totally unique.Watch this movie for a peaceful time of Horror.

322,james_corck3,A viewed-from-the-basement alien movie,9,26 December 2005,"M Night Shyamalan is used to take usual and known subjects to make the screenplays of his movies. Sixth sense was a ghosts love story. Unbreakable was a super-hero movie. This is an alien movie. And, unlike any other alien movie, we never see the menace. But this is not quite the fear that the actual War of the worlds gives to us. Signs is REALLY SCARY. It makes you jump of your seat, or maybe fall of it because you are always at the edge. When you are not screaming or bumping, you are laughing, so the few and really funny humor touches are that funny because of the fear around the whole action. Without fear, that humor is just silly. And the players are just another nail in the filmography of Night. Mel Gibson gives a lot sense of sutile performance, just because he moves no muscle of his face. Joaquin Phoenix is a solid brave little bro for Mel, like the protector of the family in the physical sense. And the kids are both enormous, so good that the adults are dwarfs compared to them, specially the little girl, Abigail, who's character became important in the last five minutes of the movie. They said there is no surprise at the end. I say there is, and a big one, one of those surprises that make you want to see this movie again as it's finishing. And it defends one of the basics pillars of Night's movies, the family. Until he did The Village and he killed everybody. Ha ha ha!",Signs

You never even see anyone get killed. You just don't feel the danger. You don't feel the impending doom and invasion. You don't get that feeling at the bottom of your stomach when something bad is about to happen. Then, the aliens just suddenly decide to leave, and we find out that the aliens' weakness is water. In the end, all the pieces of the puzzle ""fit together"", like the little girl only drinking half the glass of water, the guy playing baseball, etc. The ending was very disappointing. Also, if the aliens' weakness is water, why would they be interested in earth, which is 70% water? And what about the water vapor in the air? Exactly. The tin foil they put on their heads to keep the aliens from reading their thoughts was funny. I give this movie a 5/10",Signs

Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phenix, Rory Culkin, and even Abigail Bresnan turn in great performances. The visuals are pretty good, and Shyamalan never fails to keep you on the edge of your seat. The suspense rarely lets down, and when it does, we are given some comic relief. The last half-hour of the movie is heart-pounding and well paced. The last 15-5 minutes, however, are heart stopping. The aliens, although they are rarely seen, add to the sense of suspense and fear. Graham's feeling of no one watching over them makes for some good moments, especially at the dinner table scene towards the end. Now, I'm not saying Signs is perfect. It tries too hard to be scary sometimes, and the *ULTIMATE SPOILER AHEAD* fact that water destroyed the aliens is lazy writing.

327,angelynx-2,Another M. Night gem,9,4 August 2002,"Reading through the preceding comments it strikes me that many people are evaluating this film on what it's not. It's ""not as good as Sixth Sense"" or it's ""not really about alien invasions and crop circles"" or it's ""not an action film like Independence Day"" (--for which we should all be thanking our preferred version of the Supreme Being, in my opinion!) And many more are missing points that are perfectly clear (ahem: the reason Gibson's character doesn't want to use cusswords is because he was a minister, not because he's incapable of rage: his outburst to his kids later on is *perfectly* believable).--I don't know what movie all these folks saw, but the one I saw was one of the best this year, and doesn't need to apologize for anything it's not.The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is Fox Mulder's ""I want to believe."" So much of this movie is about belief and faith, about people's willingness--and unwillingness--to believe. Graham Hess' loss of his wife has caused him to lose his faith, not only in God, but in life; he can't believe. Little Morgan unhesitatingly accepts a writer's speculations about the nature and intent of the alien invaders; he needs to believe. People around the world take shelter (as in the classic War of the Worlds, which is referenced) in places of worship. But M. Night is not leading us toward religious faith only, but toward a much wider sense that ""there are no coincidences"" --that there is reason to believe in fate, destiny, a vast and mysterious web that connects even the most seemingly unconnected details.There is tremendous build-up of fear and suspense, and a surprisingly large dose of humor (Gibson in particular does topnotch work in that regard: I loved his ""Raar! I'm insane with rage!"" routine as he tries to intimidate what he thinks are trespassers, and his speech to the pantry door). The depiction of one family's response to a worldwide crisis --barricade yourselves indoors, devour reference books and watch CNN 20 hours a day; heck, I know I would--was completely believable. But the real process of the film is Graham's slow re-examination of his wife's death, especially of her last words, and his eventual understanding that they meant much more than they seemed to mean; that there really are no coincidences, and that even this seemingly random tragedy was a sign, with great meaning and gifts to give. It's not a head-snapping twist ending like the ones in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable (OK, there, even I did it =), but just as profound and breathtaking in its implications. And that's not even mentioning the superb craft of the film itself, its sheer no-background-noise silence in which the least sound is magnified, its shadows and subtlety and use of patterns in everyday life to convey the sense of signs all around us. (--dig the curtains and the doorframe; dig the test pattern Merrill sees on the TV when all channels have ceased broadcasting; does any station in the USA still use those? but you know M. Night couldn't resist using it because of its wonderful arcane look, like a crop circle itself, or some sort of mystical sigil...)From my new favorite director, a gem that deserves your attention.",Signs

329,larcher-2,One can't ignore the religious,8,5 August 2002,"One can't ignore the religious backdrop of MNS's movies (and his own life)--a mixture of Anglican/Episcopalianism and Roman Catholicism.  These are the two tracks of his own background, and inform all of his movies. Sixth Sense has more than a touch of the Catholic idea of Purgatory.  Signs' lead character seems to be an Episcopal priest.  In Signs, the alien invasion is an Hitchcockian ""McGuffin"" that allows the director to play with the serious theological problems of theodicy (the existence of evil in a divinely created and directed world) and divine providence.  The ending goes flat for those who reject the divine decree that evil is idiotic; specifically, that the aliens who are vulnerable to water invade a world that is mostly water.  Their plans are absurd in precisely the way that Hitler at the height of his power planed absurdly; he failed to invade the England that would have fallen to him in a very few weeks and instead invaded the Russia whose endless spaces defeated him.  Divine providence ensures that evil in the end is incredibly stupid.  One may or may not accept this as true, but it is the belief that underlies these films.Like it or not, MSN is making religious movies.  He is using every Hollywood gimmick to make his movies sell.  There is a lot here that is derivative (I have not read all the comments, but surely it is obvious that one of the movies from which he has borrowed is ""Day of the Triffids"").

330,Douglas_Holmes,Prepare Yourself- for the biggest disappointment of the year.,1,2 August 2002,"*BIG SPOILERS*I just returned from the theater where this was screened at a matinee showing. I went early- with all the hype, the theater was sure to be packed.Right. If you call 12 people ""packed.""I paid $5.75 to see this movie.I paid WAY too much.The acting from the entire cast was among the most overblown I've ever seen- the performances were laughably stilted and the dialogue is so wooden that it could have been cut with a chainsaw and sold by the board-foot. There ARE some very tense, even scary parts to the film, primarily a segment involving the invasion of a farm family's domicile by hostile Aliens. Otherwise, this mess was a complete waste.Apparently whoever wrote this thing has never worked with exposition before. Instead of letting the audience in on important facts about the aliens a little at a time, we have a precocious, obnoxious brat (played to perfection by Rory Culkin) who spews information about the aliens until you begin to think that he might be one of them. Of course, you quickly realize that that's ridiculous, just like the film itself.The lynchpin of the movie was that there are no coincidences, that everything is apparently planned by some Higher Power and NOTHING is random. If you know ANYTHING about probability theory and statistics, you know that this is utter rubbish. I won't even waste time on the hoaxes involving crop circles. Use your search engine and you'll find out where they came from.Moreover, the film lifts its basic plot from George Pal's classic 1952 film, ""The War of the Worlds."" In both movies, the evil alien invaders are wiped slick by things that are generally so common that we don't think twice about them- disease bacteria in WOTW, plain old H2O in this flick. WOTW ends with a shot of a church still standing in the ruined landscape of Los Angeles while a choir hymns on the soundtrack; SIGNS ends with our protagonist, a former clergyman who had lost his faith, putting on his clerical collar once again. Actually, I think that this is also an attempt to hijack some of the Apocalyptic Doomsday success from the ""Left Behind"" book series.Please don't waste your time and money on this. If you must see it, wait for the  VHS/DVD releases. They'll be coming out very soon.

There are only two positive episodes in this ""film"" that comes to mind; namely the one in which you see his wife talking to holier than thou(Gibson)but missing her lower half(Sorry folks you don't get to see any juicy bits I'm afraid,but anyway...).and the one in which he get some of his fingers chopped off.

333,Ashcropolis,One of my favorite Alien invasion movies,8,5 February 2019,"The movie is really good. Amazing thrilling moments and horror elements here and there. I loved everyone's performance. Even the 2 little kids had surprisingly good enough performances. The build up to the invasion is fantastic. Some people might be disappointed because it doesn't really focus on the invasion as a whole. It just focuses on the family and the basement they are in for the entire ""invasion"" some of the drama with the 2 kids dragged a little. The ending also seemed rushed and ... just not fulfilling enough I guess. Those are my only few negatives. Otherwise fantastic movie.",Signs
334,HBeachBabe,A little movie disguised as a big one,9,4 August 2002,"Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan likes to make slow, quiet movies. These are the kind of movies that normally would play at the local art house theater and makes $500,000 before going to video. The difference with his movies is that he makes his little movies about big subjects with A-list casts. Of course, a little movie called ""The Sixth Sense"" has pretty much guaranteed an audience for whatever he does.That his movies are as successful as they are is almost a mystery. He doesn't rely on big effects, crashing soundtracks and MTV editing, but uses long scenes and silence to build tension and lets his characters and story ""breathe."" Not traits that generally sell a lot of movie tickets.""Signs"" is a ""BIG"" movie. It's ID4. Close Encounters of the Third Kind. War of the Words. V. Except it's told from the point of view of the guy usually listed in the credits as ""Farmer #3"" It's an alien invasion movie that almost forgot to include the aliens. There's no big political machinations. No military. No panicking townsfolk. No giant spaceships blowing up large buildings.What there is a one family. One small, insignificant family whose entire existence is changed by.... something. By keeping the focus small, on ordinary people, not the scientists, the president, the fighter pilot, etc., Shyamalan gives us people we can relate to; not necessarily people to cheer for in rousing patriotic battle, but people who are us. Watching Will Smith dogfight with aliens in Independence Day was fun, but how many of us will get to do that when the ETs arrive?Story-wise, the aliens are just a means to an end anyway. The alien arrival plot is just the surface - an excuse for Shyamalan to ponder the big questions of God and fate, chance and destiny. Do things just happen or do they happen for a reason? I suppose your enjoyment of the film come the finale will be dependent on your views on those ""big questions."" I may not agree 100& with his conclusions but I can't fault his method of presenting them.As with his previous films ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" the pace is slow. Some may get bored waiting for the promised aliens but as before, the pace allows plenty of time to become emotionally involved with this family and the events going on. We feel the tension as they do. Sure we want things to happened faster, but they don't. Events don't happen at the pace we want, we wait and we get more anxious waiting, more nervous, we question. Waiting is worse sometimes then the jolt we were waiting for.Shyamalan isn't afraid of waiting. He uses it, just as he uses silence and darkness. Often, he allows the silence to go on longer than we are comfortable with so when the sound does come back, the effect is amplified. One scene occurs in pitch black, with the screen in darkness for what feels like minutes (although is probably only 10-20 seconds) with only sound effects. The effect is genuinely scary, even more so when the light finally comes back.The packed theater jumped, screamed and was truly shocked at least a half dozen times. This is truly a frightening film, a masterful use of ""less-is-more"" film-making where every slight glimpse of aliens generates a gasp.The film is not without it's flaws. The finale has a weird pace to it. because the focus hasn't been on the ""big event"" of earth vs. aliens, the resolution occurs off screen and thus seems rather convenient. For a moment, it's as if the story has just ended but without the satisfaction of a real resolution. Furthermore, there is certain amount of irony in asking the question ""are there coincidences or do things happen for a reason?"" in a movie; movies being specifically scripted in a such a way that there are no coincidences, every character trait, ever action, ever line of dialogue has a specific place and has been put there by the screenwriter to be used later to resolve the plot. Here we have a movie that answers the question ""is this just a coincidence?"" with events that are scripted not to be. Movie themselves are self-contained universes with their own ""God"" - the screenwriter, so it's somewhat disingenuous to use a movie to tackle the question. But the trip is still one worth taking. Shyamalan is quickly becoming one of my favorite storytellers; more than just a director, a storyteller with a singular vision and the skills and patience to tell big, quiet stories.",Signs
335,videofreak2002,"This is what a movie should be: scary, suspensful, mysterious, and wonderful!",10,16 September 2002,"In 1999, 2 films were written by a little known director who made 2 films before: ""Praying With Anger"" (1992) and ""Wide Awake"" (1998).  The director's name: M. Night Shyamalan.  The 2 1999 films: Co-writing ""Stuart Little"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" which he also directed.  With ""The Sixth Sense"" becoming an international hit (becoming the #1 thriller of all time, getting positive reviews, nominated for 6 oscars-BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST SCREENPLAY, BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR, BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS, and BEST FILM EDITING, and grossing almost $300 million), Shyamalan is at the top of his game.  Now, it's 2000 and with ""The Grinch"" becoming the #1 B.O. hit of 2000 (grossing over $260 million), Shyamalan decided to switch from dead people to superheroes/comic books with ""Unbreakable.""  During it's release, the film got mixed reviews and grossed almost $100 million.  Now, it's 2002, and ""Spider-Man"" is the #1 B.O. hit (grossing over $400 million), Shyamalan again switched from dead people to superheroes/comic books to crop signs/aliens and decided to use Mel Gibson instead of Bruce Willis as the main character.  The new movie is called ""Signs,"" and it's getting alot of positive buzz.  Well, after being bugged by my friends every day since the first day of school, I finally saw the movie on a Saturday.  AND IT WAS THE SCARIEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!  Scarier than ""The Sixth Sense"" (which I loved) and scarier than both ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Exorcist"" (which they both sucked).  M. Night Shyamalan has done it again.  For those of you who enjoy thrillers, then ""Signs"" is your movie.  Plus, I'll be waiting for Shyamalan's next movie.  I like to see what he does next.

337,watto124,Pure cinematic terror and fun!,10,30 August 2002,"Shyamalan has done it again, this time with ""Signs"", and I consider it to be his best effort. This undertaking proves to be much more entertaining than his other two endeavors, ""The Sixth Sense"", and ""Unbreakable"". And although I loved these two films, ""Signs"" surpasses them immeasurably. The basic plot is that a family living on a farm discover crop circles in their fields, the first of many bizarre occurances. Like a good episode of ""The Twilight Zone"", the movie keeps the ambiguity flowing dramatically throughout. Mel Gibson is fantastic. The actor plays a man who seems always together, even when fantastic things are happening all around him. Joaquin Phoenix is good too. He is sort of where most of the comic relief comes from in the movie. That is another thing about the movie: it is very funny. Typically, movies that try to be funny AND scary end up being a big mess. ""Signs"" is genuinely hilarious. But then it will turn around and be absolutely horrifying and sometimes disturbing. It succeeds. Many have complained about the film's religious undertones overwhelming the sci-fi premise. This simply is not true. The two themes go hand-in-hand with eachother as one story. Shyamalan has eased a bit off the artsy camera angles, something I kind of miss. The dialogue and characters are more realistic in ""Signs"", and therefore makes your feelings for the people much stronger. Howard's music is not very versatile, but he has many variations of the theme and it is very effective and makes the movie even creepier. ""Signs"" is probably the most pop-culture-friendly Shyamalan movie, but considering how good this one turned out, maybe the other two needed some of that. I loved this movie. Everything about it was lovely and entertaining. Heck, even the kids were excellent! I can't wait for M. Night's next project to crop up! 10/10",Signs
338,LaurieMann,"Excellent beginning & details, but poor script logic and horrible ending",6,3 August 2002,"This movie is so promising.  A lovely cast, good dialogue, sharp directing early on.Oy.Sadly, the movie is kind of a mess, though Gibson and the kids give pretty good performances.Spoilers. * * *At one point, the Hesses are in a pizza parlour, talking about the paranoia gripping the small town after crop circles are discovered. Then, the director pans to a man walking to his van.  The man is, the director, an Indian man who is walking in small town American while the cast talks about fear of outsiders.What a great moment, I thought.Unfortunately, I missed a key piece of dialogue.  The Indian man, it turns out, was the town vet who'd fallen asleep at the wheel of his truck and killed Mrs. Hess several months before.  And that's why everyone was eyeing him so warily.That was the first of many disappointments in this movie.Actually, the logical gaffes start earlier.  We are supposed to believe that no airplanes or helicopters fly over Bucks County.  So that the Hess's massive crop circle is completely unknown by anyone outside of the family and a very tired sheriff.  How could it have remained unnoticed??We're supposed to have a sense of growing paranoia about the possible alien invasion.  (Our local movie critic, a man who typically writes intelligent reviews, completely lost it over this point - he felt that no one would be afraid of an alien invasion since everyone had seen ET.  But everyone's also seen Independence Day...)  That was generally pretty well-handled, except that Hesses completely loose it before it's clear that the aliens are probably malevolent.  The aliens pretty much stay up in their spaceships and send down periodic reconnaisance.  They don't level cities like in Independence Day.The Hesses nail themselves into their old farmhouse, then go into the basement (a great place for a boy with severe asthma to hang out). The aliens make a lot of noise (shades of Close Encounters without the backlighting!), but never actually invade the room.  When an alien finally meets up with the family, you can absolutely see the ending coming from about the middle of the movie.The last quarter or so of the movie, and the director way overusing himself in what should have been a walk-on, were very problematic. M. Night Shyamalan also has a bad habit of recapping his movie near the end.  While it was effective (and almost necessary) in The Sixth Sense, it was really ridiculous in this instance.  And using that moment to flashback to Mrs. Hess' death completely broke the tension in the ""now"" of the movie.I liked The Sixth Sense quite a bit, and found Unbreakable flawed, but interesting.  However, Signs, particularly the last half hour, is just plain dumb.  And extremely disappointing.  I think Shyamalan, the director, needs to fire Shyamalan the writer before something worse happens.",Signs
339,akon5,Night makes this worth watching...,8,15 August 2002,"Big Spoilers. Do not read if you haven't seen this movie.If this film was done by another director, we may not get the same result. Shyamalan appears to have alot of skils in terms of making these types of movies...building up tensions and story line. He uses 'silence' very well and certain scenes are very well done. (Like in a scene when every family members were standing there listening to the dog barking outside and suddenly there was yelping and silence. Replacing it is the sound of the clock ticking.) However, I must say that he is not very good (or is still in the process of perfecting the skill) in bringing across messages...He attempt to 'say' something deep in unbreakable and again in this film. 
The directing in this film alone is worth watching...plus some really well thought out dialogs and a good storyline (although the ending is alittle weak). These type of stories can only have two possible endings. Either there are aliens or it is all a hoax. If one chooses the alien path, one may fall into the problem of giving the story a shallow ending. The water concept was alittle silly (bringing the movie down to the line of Mars Attack).

This is an average work because it is only about alien invasions and also there are a few 'illogical' holes in the plot. Those that thinks this film is great is probably because they see it more of an exercise to the meaning of faith and humanity. The reasons why I think this movie is excellent. Yes, if this movie is only about an alien invasion, this movie would be below average, but I do not think M. Night is trying to do only that.It is not by chance that the movie is named 'Signs'. It is not by chance that there are certain 'strange' signs incorporated in the movie. It is not by chance that there are inept dialogs and humour in the film. It is not by chance that Bo mentioned so specifically about 'dreams' three times (out of context in a normal conversation). It is not by chance that this movie has crop circles in it. YOu see, M. Night is playing with the viewers. Not only giving the characters in the movie 'signs' to play with their faith, he also did the same to us viewers.

342,KatharineFanatic,Nothing is coincidence,8,19 August 2002,"There are many who wonder, can you logically mix a faith in God with science fiction? Tolkien thought that you could, hence his belief that ""God is the Lord, of humans, and of angels, and of elves."" But few directors or writers have ever attempted to tackle a serious religious subject within the context of sci-fi. This is one of the first that manages to do so successfully.
To be honest, I didn't like the director's other two films. ""The Sixth Sense"" was creepy and morbid, and ""Unbreakable"" was boring. Most of my friends promised I would like this one, so I went. I was actually surprised. I think a lot of people don't like it merely because of its powerful religious references... the fact that Gibson's character is an ex-Anglican minister (not Catholic; Catholic ministers cannot marry) whose faith has been destroyed by his wife's death. (Ironically enough, the man responsible is portrayed by Shyamalan himself.)The film is not about aliens per say, but more about faith in general; do things happen for a reason, or are they coincidence? That's what makes ""Signs"" so fascinating... there is a purpose behind everything that the director reveals to us in a Hitchcockian like sense of horror that isn't blood and gore and cheap thrills, but genuine suspense. Why the water glasses? Was that mumbled fragment of memory brought to his wife's lips on her deathbed merely random? Why the hints of Merrel's background as a ball player?Yes, there are plot holes... but only if you refuse to accept God as a part of the big picture. Most people didn't get the innuendo about the aliens being first beaten in the Middle-east... otherwise known as Israel. Ring any bells? The best thing about ""Signs"" is that it's never completely serious... the scene in which Merrel is found wearing a tinfoil hat along with the kids had everyone in our showing in stitches. In short, it takes an intelligence to see this film for what it really is. It's not a cheap alien movie. If you're a Christian, like I am, it won't insult your faith, either. Is it really post-9/11? That conversation on the couch brought back memories.",Signs

Now everyone is excited by this latest flavor (who incidentally sports a directing style highly influenced by David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock). Sorry, Mel is one of my favorite actors, this role stretched his repetoir even more. I can't figure out why he did it. One reviewer, more perspecacious than most, understood the film was about the redemption of Mel's faith, but for goodness sake, that was the subtext of the film and only about ten percent of viewers ever understand the subtext of a complex film. But first, you must have a good compelling story and sorry, but it wasn't there.  Watching this film reminded me of an impressionist painting of the pointalist school. Lots of images, good camera work (although overbearing), but the story had more holes than my old gym socks. Perhaps the Director felt he could fill those holes with some interesting camera angles and a few good boinks in the script. At the end the audience was grumbling. They'd been cheated out of a throughput plot. Maybe it was too sophisticated.  The big test will be to see the fall off in box office in weeks two and three. If it drops more than 35% then the word of mouth wasn't good. If not, then the picture has legs. One thing this picture does lack is repeatability. I, for one, have no desire to see it again.

It was tense for a while, but by its conclusion, this film left a sour taste in my mouth. It seems ""symbolic"", alright, of a US state of mind tuned up to xenophobic hysteria, in the wake of 9-11.Lacking imagination, all the writers and filmakers could come up with is a confrontation with laughable invading monsters lacking feeling or rational motive, thwarted by fearful but righteous and practical Earthlings, who win out 'cause they're hewers of wood and drawers of water--salt of the earth types. And the Lord, too, IS, on their side, and delivers up miracles to order.This being Hollywood, we could have at least been treated to some decent effects--sound effects aside. It really is rather low-budget. Pitter-pattering feet were about the biggest scare that Signs could muster.

Yes I know Hitchcock wrote some of the stories for his movies, but most of what he did write was dreck like this movie. Shyamalan is a very talented director but he should stop trying to write.  This movie had some chills but I hate Shyamalan's insistence on inane plot twists to try prove how smart he is.  He assumes because he fooled us with Sixth Sense he must do it for every movie!  Wrong!  And there is a lot wrong with this movie (***Warning Spoilers***):        1.  Aliens can travel millions of light years without help but they need crop circles to find their way around!  Huh?  We primitive humans have GPS systems.   One would think the aliens would have something better.        2.  They can be killed by water but come to a planet that is 70% water!  Huh?  They also come naked with no protective suits or weapons. Maybe they do have advanced weathermen though.  Don't need to worry about rain EVER while they are making crop circles for their friends.  Maybe they are related to the wicked witch...        3.  Mel Gibson's wife is killed in a tragic accident stolen from a Homicide episode (which was stolen from a true incident).   To set up a ridiculous finale with a baseball bat.         4.  Thousands of people are killed by the aliens, but ONE kid is saved by a bunch of lame coincidences.

I did think the plot to this was very weak and predictable and not at all as good as his other efforts, but something about how simple this was appealed to me. I love that it's slow and takes it's time. I truly enjoyed the characters and came to care about them. It frustrates me that it fell so short when it had such potential. Phoenix was excellent in this and pretty much stole the show. Also the little boy played by Rory Culkin was very good and a much better actor than his older brother. The little girl was adorable and I really enjoyed the touch of her obsession with water. Gibson did a good job and it was nice to see him in a role were he wasn't the almighty hero with all the answers. In this he was a broken man who really didn't know how to handle the situation. His weakness was scorned by his children. I think there were strong performances from everyone even the local cop who I thought was fantastic. If you can get around the sub-plot of the aliens it's a very nice film. That's right I said sub-plot. The main point isn't about regaining faith either. The main point is that events in our lives happen for reasons we couldn't comprehend, but they happen for a reason. For people bent out shape over the religious aspects I just have to say get over it. It was a very simple film with a simple message. I enjoyed it and the people in the audience with me seemed to enjoy it enough to clap at the end. Although not everyone applauded I think we all got more than our money's worth. (50 cents)",Signs

He casts himself in a key role (of a man whose life has collapsed around him because of an accident) -and then blows it, almost ruining the film for me.

One day, mysterious crop circles appears in their cornfield and all over the world and the start to being suspicious of an extraterrestrial attack. This is the story and it's very well introduced to us. The story in itself was great, except for a few things I will tell you later, and gave some emotional moments but also very tense moments. The movie stays very well in all of it's duration, except the last ten minutes or so, which were a big let down from the whole movie and left me a bit cold (well from here I save the awesome score by James Newton Howard and the performance of Mel Gibson).Mel Gibson provides a good performance, sometimes a bit odd, but overall is good, and also Joaquin Phoenix who provides some very good scenes with Mel Gibson, even the little girl, Abigail Breslin, had some time to shine and to help you to connect with this family, but I personally don't like the little boy. It's true that he provides some very emotional moments with his father, Mel Gibson, but that's not until the last part of the movie, in the rest he provides very awkward moments that don't feel natural for a ten-year-old kid. I'm specially talking about the thing that he kills his dog with a knife at the beginning of the movie, or the things of the aliens, that he seems to know a lot about, or the phrases he says randomly like ""He's going to burn it all"" or the thing of the silver cones in their heads. This is one of the main flaws of the movie that didn't worked for me.But in the technical aspects you cannot say that Shyamalan is not a master of manipulation. He is able to show just the thing he wants to show you without leaving too much time for reacting. One example of this is the scene where Mel Gibson enters at night in the cornfield, the tension builds up with the music but suddenly stops and you think nothing is going to happen, but then he drops his flashlight and when he turns it on again you can see for a second this alien crossing the cornfield near him, the music enters and you realize this really and amazing way of frightening you. His way of filming, moving the camera away of the things you really want to see, just keeps this tension along the movie. The music created by James Newton Howard is one of the other things that add a lot of tension to this. He is able to create quirky fast themes but also very tense moments to keep you on the edge of your seat.I recommend you this movie if you're a Shyamalan fan. You will surely enjoy it as I did, except this little awkward moments he has usually in his movies.",Signs

A good example is the scene where Phoenix is watching the first videotaped footage of an alien sighting - very creepy.Tak Fujimoto (Twin Peaks, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense) is becoming one of my favourite cinematographers. His camera work is extremely effective at creating moods, usually without drawing attention to itself. The cast is uniformly good (except for cop Cherry Jones, whose backwoods act is not believable). Mel Gibson is limited as an actor, but this is his best work to date.However, there are some things Shyamalan is not so clever at setting up. He was on the right track in wanting the sci-fi elements to be grafted onto a solid dramatic story, but his script veers from intelligent to heavy-handed.The biggest eye-rollers are the daughter's conspicuous glasses-of-water neurosis, and the phrase ""swing away"", which is ridiculously built up to be an earth-shattering revelation. I don't think Mel needed to remember his wife's last words to come up with the brilliant idea that helps save his son's life.",Signs

Night Shayamalahayamahan or whatever showed the world that he wasn't really the heir to Hitchcock's throne at all by making this tiresome, stupid film about crop-circles and alien invasions and whatnot. Well this is unimaginative and plain boring at best.First of all the movie is really dull. Sure, an alien movie doesn't need to be fast-paced to be great (Alien anyone?), but it has to interesting in some way, ""Signs"" plain ain't. Then it's also stuffed with clichés and, ugh, Mel Gibson plus a boring, tedious side story and some of the wimpiest, ugliest, most unscary aliens since Nukie. It also has a flaw that is so big that the whole movie becomes completely illogical: anyone who watched this movie and liked it, may I ask you: why didn't the aliens disintegrate in the air?

360,rorymacveigh,I don't know how this is so popular!,2,20 July 2012,"For a film that is supposed to have been the thing that made Shyamalan what many describe as the next Spielburg, there are too many things wrong with this movie. The main points of interest being the Characters, the Story and worst of all, the fact that they actually state out loud why the movie is doomed to fail.First off, lets start with the characters. They're all as bland as is humanly possible. Everyone seems to have a problem talking in this movie because they resort to whispering, even when the situation isn't tense enough to require it. Also, no one seems to have an emotion, they literally just say their lines. Mel Gibson seems to just monotonously deliver his lines, and don't get me started on Rory Culkin, who seems to have kept up his family tradition of blank, emotionless faces that seem to come naturally to them because no one else on earth could put on such a boring face even if they tried. Also, the children speak like adults and the adults speak like children. Whilst Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix discuss yelling and acting crazy to scare away the aliens, Rory Culkin is busy describing the fate of the future and the earth to his sister like he was some kind of Einstein trapped in a child's body. Children do not act like this in reality, rather than discussing what their kids might think of their current situation, they'd be running around waving their arms in the air panicking, if not they'd be thinking about what's on TV tonight.Second of all, the story is rather inconsistent. It has Mel Gibson as the distraught father who lost his wife to a car accident and this is somehow woven into an alien invasion. However, the points at which they choose to reflect on Gibson's troubled past are so ridiculously timed. For example, whilst the alien is holding his son hostage, he decides to have a 5 minute flashback to when his wife died. As for myself, I'd be thinking of a way to get this alien off my son and kill it and leave the contemplation of my past to another day. The flashback scene of his wife dying would have had a more appropriate appearance say when he was lying awake in bed thinking of the past, like it does in most other films. Also there are many characters who say really odd lines which you may think are important who don't appear again, just 5 second cameos of people saying things that could be important to the situation, but they again just disappear.And thirdly and most damningly, the fact that they state out loud why the film can't work. The planet is being invaded by a technologically superior race of aliens who have travelled light-years to get here, but they can't break through Pantry Doors! Whoever thought that up needs to be kicked for being so stupid! You can't be this idiotic! If the aliens had trouble working with doors, say they were allergic to wood or something, they would have built a device to help them overcome this problem, but nope, they came all this way just to have their grand invasion plan brought to a grinding halt by a wooden door!Also, the aliens are harmed when they come into contact with water, it melts them. Well, perhaps they should have realised that critical point before they decided to invade a planet where 2/3s of its surface are covered in this harmful substance. The first rainstorm they come across (and if they've invaded the United Kingdom that's only minutes away), they'll be running down the drains in no time! You'd think also that they'd prepare for such an eventuality, like, oh I don't know, creating some protective suit or something so that they can't be harmed by the rain or any other water. But again, nope, they just came all this way with no preparation for this kind of situation, just so they could melt away into the gutter faster than they can say 'maybe we should have prepared for something like this...'This movie has too many problems to count, the characters are bland cardboard puppets, the story is driving in reverse, the climax is ridiculously simplistic and they went and admitted the film's fatal flaw right to the audience. If no one else picked up on this obvious plot hole the size of the Grand Canyon, then I must be going slightly mad. Yes Shyamalan is a great director, especially in previous films like the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but those were psychological dramas rather than something more practical like an alien take over where a little more emotion and a little more practicality is involved. My advice to him is, go back to the stuff you were good at, the stuff that actually got you good reviews without having to butcher the whole plot and the film's feasibility whilst doing it.",Signs

362,CyMaddux,Ho-Hum ripoff of Independence Day meets Children of the Corn,6,9 August 2002,"I expected a lot more from this movie then what I got.  You have a very weak ending to a cliche plot that is marred with the usual (let me stand in the living room and let the aliens break-in mentality)  Gibson fans will also be let down by what I feel is his worse acting job of his career. Gibson once again plays the guardian of a household (yes another Braveheart, The Patriot, role) in which his strong ideals and moral glue hold the family together through ""tough times"" Without giving much away, don't expect any wonderful visual effects, or any deep thinking characters in this stroy.. There are many similarities to Independence Day and Children of the Corn, I counted at least 3 from ID and 2 from COC.  The reason I give this movie a 6 is the way the suspense flows well without having to constantly see an alien.. But the ending is a letdown and there are some flaws..  ** minor spoiler** - The Aliens can read minds  ( the end of the movie does not reflect this, ex- swing away.. - No one in their right mind isnt going to get some kind of weapon to fight the aliens off.. Instead you have both adults standing there waiting for the aliens to enter the house.. gimme a break! -  Asthma inhaler.. Ok if your kid has asthma, isnt this a top priority item?/ Instead lets just leave it upstairs so he can have an asthma attack.

If you expect a horror/action movie about aliens and etc., don't bother going to see this movie.Yes, there are some ""War of the Worlds""-like moments, and this film WILL go down in my book as one of the better alien flicks I've seen.But this film is about  faith and forgiveness. Is there a design, a reason for everything?

365,mikepwong,Well Executed,8,10 August 2003,"Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. I have to say that before seeing this movie, I was bracing myself for a disappointment due to mixed reviews. I must now say that I found the movie to be quite remarkable, well executed, and nicely crafted. M. Night Shyamalan rightly deserves respect for putting out a film with a lot of his personal touches instead of putting out something that people expect to see. While `Signs' will have scenes of the traditional or convention variety, it is the ambiance of the scenes that is unique.Shyamalan made good use of the films lead actors. Mel Gibson as recent widower Graham Hess, and Joaquin Phoenix as the younger brother Merrill Hess are both well cast and interesting to watch. They both brought a lot to the movie. Shyamalan himself has a somewhat key supporting role in the movie as well.It was a good choice to make the movie focus on the Hess family instead of the global distress of an alien invasion. The few times that we did see an alien during the middle of the movie was really frightening. Especially the first time Graham Hess (Gibson) sees one right outside the window of his children's bedroom. I believe we see an alien (or part of one) seven times in the movie, and the first six appearances were only for a split second, at first I was dissatisfied that we didn't see more. Yet in hindsight, less appearances of an alien does accomplish more for the movie.We never find out why the aliens were invading, but the viewer does realize that they were hostile. Here is one qualm that I have with this movie, it seemed a little illogical to me that the aliens would think that humans wouldn't realize their (the aliens) weakness since this substance is so abundant on our planet.`Signs' really held my attention and I highly recommend it. In fact, I look forward to seeing it again.",Signs

367,MyDarkStar,Do not over-analyze this film !,6,4 August 2002,"***WARNING : DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS****This film is not one that is meant to hold up to extreme analysis regarding the aliens' logic. It is a film that is based upon issues that go much deeper than alien invasion. It is a film that deals with a person's faith, and how we may indeed be given ""signs"" from a Higher Power everyday of our life without realizing it.Because of that, it really bothers me when I read people criticizing the film for certain aspects. Some of the such criticisms included naming the aliens' vulnerability to water as ""silly"" - because they are invading ""a planet that is 2/3 covered by water."". Another recurring criticism was regarding what the viewer felt was a ""cheap looking special effect"" in the portrayal of the aliens. To me, these criticisms only show that the viewer was viewing the movie in a very shallow way. First of all, the aliens' vulnerability to water. Just for the sake of addressing this question, let me say that one could make a case that the alien invasion depicting in this film was only the BEGINNING of the invasion. This is actually hinted at by the army recruiter who says there have been reports of ""people in shadows"", and that those are reconnaissance tactics to just see the ""level of danger"" in an invasion. In other words, we are only seeing the very FIRST aliens to ever come to this planet. These are the aliens that come to an alien planet to see if it is safe for the rest of the aliens ! Sure, they might have a vulnerability to a fluid which takes up 2/3 of our planet's surface - but can they still use the remainder 1/3 of the planet ? So we are seeing that first ""wave"" of aliens - the ""reconnaissance"" mission.Another way of addressing this criticism is to address it in the same manner as the ""alien looked cheap"" criticism. My response to this is ""so what ?"". Is that what you REALLY came to see this film for ?In all fairness, the water issue goes much deeper than simply the aliens' vulnerability to it. It goes into the true underlying theme of the film : faith. The water here is used an instrument to illustrate some of the religious undertones of the film.As for the film itself, M. Night Shyamalan did a brilliant job in keeping me tense throughout the film with his quick glimpses of an alien leg disappearing behind a corn stalk, a quick shot of a shadow figure on top of a barn, or quickly moving shadows behind a boarded up door. The whole time I was wondering what exactly was going to happen. Would there actually be an all-out invasion ? Would we only see hints of the aliens ?
Shyamalan's answer to this was perfect. That is because he managed to bring together the true theme of the film (faith), with the alien invasion. Also, by only interacting with one singular alien, Shyamalan also seems to be further expressing the fact that this is only the BEGINNING of the invasion. In other words, the viewer shouldn't necessarily consider this as though the aliens' are now ""defeated"". This is only round one of the invasion....but until round two takes place, keep the faith.Don't misinterpret that as a call for a sequel because there should NEVER be a sequel to this movie. It ended perfectly.",Signs
368,Matador07,Comical,3,1 March 2003,"A movie about intergalactic space travelers who can be defeated by a squirt gun and retaliate by inspirng asthmatic attacks in young children, Signs is extremely hard to take seriously.  I kept on waiting for the humans to wise up and break out the Macintoshes, but after seeing the alien(s) at the end, I guess why bother.  Lock 'em in the closet, beat them over the head with a bat, and turn on the sprinklers.  Problem solved.  Oh well.  Not sure if anything could have been made of this movie given that people have admitted to creating crop circles with boards strapped to their feet, but whatever might have been made of it, certainly wasn't here.  Kind of uplifting in a way -- after watching this movie I say bring the space aliens on!  I've got my garden hose and a healthy supply of water balloons.Guess you can give it a few stars just for the reasonably moody style and acting (you can really sense the presence of the Sixth Sense's director at times).

The story is basically of a ministers' faith, challenged after the death of his wife and a threat of alien invasion. Mel Gibson's performance as the minister was portrayed in a quiet and passive way. The under-tone of the production was creepy, given the Director M. Night Shyamalan's past film record. Joaquin Phoenix played Mel Gibson's character's younger brother, who did a fine job in depicting the source of encouragement to Mel's characters' lack in 'faith', and also, when Mel can't accept what is happening around him.Over-all the film stirred up a lot of emotion within me and I think there is a moral to the story, but I will let you come to that conclusion. I found this film entertaining as well as enlightening, it did not have to show gore or an absurd plot. The film was not complicated in expressing the fundamental basis of what could happen.

Intriguing plot, strange household, exciting soundtrack - all going well for another suspense thriller. Then it all fell apart. The actions stopped and the talking started, and you realised that this was a household as depressing as anything by Ingmar Bergman but not nearly as interesting. Mel Gibson as a widowed ex-priest is a dull, middle-aged man, unable to articulate his loss of faith. Joaquin Phoenix as a failed baseball player (unless you know something about baseball, you don't know why he failed)is even less interesting. And the kids havn't a spark of excitement in them -even asthmatics and hypochondriacs surely could show a little childlike enthusiasm occasionally. So the action button is on pause for a dull middle part of the film, marked only by one of the silliest last suppers in movie history. It's only when the four characters end up in a darkened cellar does Shyamalan regain the spark of his earlier films - but not for long. It's hard to comment on the end without spoilers, but it's enough to say that anyone expecting the twists of Sixth Sense and Unbreakable will be sadly disappointed.",Signs

375,nickthegun,Much better than you've heard,8,20 February 2003,"(Contains a couple of wee spoilers) Things happen by a grand design. So is the point of 'Signs'. Actually its about a few other things too, but hey? Whatcha gonna do? Signs is a bit different to your usual alien invaders schtick. It actually makes you think. There is no 'God bless America' style rousing speeches, no cornball 'welcome to earth' style heroics, no 'monument lasers' or any of the other crap that's become so prevalent in the 'alien invasion' sub genre. I don't think I have enjoyed an invasion film so much since 'Invaders from Mars'. Signs is a suspense building exercise first, UFO movie second, as a result we get to see all of one alien in the whole movie. And one weapon. I know this has dissapointed most people, but it was never the intention of the director to make a heroic 'humanities last stand' type movie. He intended to, and succeeded in, creating a character driven film about a reasonably average family trying to cope with extraordinary events. Its why they don't tool up on guns, steal a space ship and take the fight to them. Its why they hide in the basement and board up all the windows. The exposition of the alien invasion is very well handled. After a series of strange goings on Graham Hess tells his kids 'no more tv', as their imaginations are running away with them. Then Graham experiences things beyond imagination and states 'lets turn the t.v on'. Which plays a pivotal part in telling them and us just what is going on. Such as the utterly marvellous scene in which Merrill sees 'them' for the first time. I also like the directing style. He seems to thrive on the mid shot, capturing so much in the frame. I was also pleased to see wonderful moments of levity in the film which do genuinely make you laugh. At the end of the day, its pretty much a no brainer to criticise Signs. Blah blah blah stupid aliens cant work a doorknob, blah blah blah why corncircles? That's not very high tech for space-faring aliens, blah blah blah earth is 70 odd % water, blah blah blah blah blah. It is, on the other hand, harder to value this film for what it is. If you can't appreciate a movie without 200 CGI shots a minute and a 'God bless America' ending, don't watch this. You will only whine about the 'Stupid Aliens' and wonder why Graham Hess isnt capping ol' ET's ass with his M60.",Signs

It develops some interesting tension and gets pretty creepy - but then it seems to lose its way. It goes from a chilling thriller to little more than a vehicle to get Mel to come around. (I also thought M Night Shyamalan's cameo was a bit too substantial to really be a directorial cameo but that's neither here nor there.) Still, in all not a bad movie - it just took the route too easy rather than the one less travelled. That's Hollywood I guess.

The trailers were excellent and compelling enough for me to want to see the movie as soon as it came out.  Of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, this by far, ranks at the bottom.  The story starts out quite strong...slowly building the background, developing the characters, and dropping hints for the viewers along the way. All of the actors did a fantastic job (save M. Night who really was rather flat and should stick to simply directing)...even the McCauley brother - who seems to have gotten all the talent of the family.  For the first 45 minutes to an hour the story is intriguing as are the characters.  A sort of eerie suspense can be felt building from quite early on in the movie.  Through dialogue, development, and flashbacks, you begin to learn that this is more than just an ""alien story"".And then it starts to fall apart.**WARNING** Spoilers!!  Do not read further if you have not seen the movie!I was on the edge of my seat, sharing Mel Gibson's fear of what was in the cornfield.  The newscast of the alien ""crashing"" the birthday party had me scream almost as loud as Jaquin Phoenix.  I was prepared for the movie only to get better.  Unfortunately, it simply didn't hold up to the first half the movie.The aliens attacking the houses and the suspense that built up during that time as the family was holed up in the basement was incredible.  I love movies where you can be scared without having to be shown exactly what is scaring you...to me it is much more effective.  For this part of the movie, it worked.  Of course, this is also when the ""cheesiness"" comes into play.  The little boy starts having an asthma attack, yet, OH NO his medicine is OUTSIDE of the room...very reminiscent of Panic Room.  However, for the sake of further developing Mel Gibson's character, I cn overlook this part to a degree. Then, just as it's getting good, it all stops.  Um, ok.  Well, I guess it had to somehow.  So basically, the aliens are defeated.  How?  Water. Perhaps the world was being overtaken by bad witches straight from Oz?  So, I have to then ask myself...why would aliens wish to ""take over"" a planet that is 3/4ths water when it is water that kills them?  Furthermore, what would they do if it suddenly started raining?  Or what about the dew on the grass in the mornings?  I mean, COME ON!  This was simply a cop-out ""we can't kill off the main characters"" ending that did not gel with the direction the story WAS taking us.  It was simply too easy.The story fantastically began drawing us in, living through the hopes, fears, regrets, sorrow, and hardships of each of the characters and yet ended so disappointingly.  I wanted to like this movie...but in the end, it was just, well, stupid.For entertainment value, I give the movie a 4 1/2 out of 5.  For compelling storyline, however, I can only give Signs 3 out of 5.  It really could have been better...considering what M. Night has proven he can do.",Signs
381,HK_Key-Si_HK,"If you haven't seen it, you won't miss out.",4,11 March 2018,"First time I saw this movie as it was pretty new. Back then I didn't like it much and the only thing I remembered was, that it was pretty boring to watch. Now I thought of giving it a second chance. But still Signs doesn't get me at all. The acting and especially the dialogues are weird and during most of the time nothing happens in this movie. Graham and Merrill just appear a little dumb, but the way they treat the two children on the other hand is presented very heart warming. Yes, at the end we see one of the aliens, but again, it seems like this movie was not really trying to provoke a deeper reaction from the audience. Signs is well shot, but the story lacks excitement and the main characters, who are usually great actors, seem totally out of place in this one. If you haven't seen it, you won't miss out.",Signs
382,klchu,The emperor has no clothes!,2,6 July 2003,"I really don't understand why people like this movie so much. I can only imagine the masses have bought into the hype and are not thinking clearly. A lot of people who didn't like this movie express themselves in, shall we say, a rather classless manner (""it's sucks ----""). The people who do like the movie do so because the ""found something deeper"" and therefore feel a little superior to those who missed the point. I can only guess that the rest of the people who claim to like this movie are only doing so to appear like they are smart and didn't miss the deeper meaning. Well, I just want to say ""There is no real deeper meaning. This is just a bad movie. Period."" The emperor has no clothes.*spoilers*I think that everyone agrees that the alien plot is stupid, but the people who like this movie seem to forgive that aspect of it in favor of the ""deep"" spiritual message. Well, lame aliens and plot holes aside, the spiritual message didn't work for me either. The movie's big point, either you believe in God's plan, or you don't, is a cop out. It looks like something at first, but it's really not. In truth, God's biggest gift to mankind is supposed to be Free Will. However, this is contradictory to the notion that God has a plan for us. You cannot have free will if God has a plan for you.And what kind of plan is it for someone to have to die a horrible death, so she can deliver a cryptic message to save the world that only works because of bad plot holes? Please.The last thing that bugs be about this movie is that people claim that it is scary. Huh? How? When? Even if you buy into the spirituality, then how can you consider the aliens scary? You'd need to accept the stupid plot to be scared of the aliens. I mean, how can you be scared of an alien that can't get out of a pantry? If people are as smart as they say they are, then they shouldn't be scared by this movie.Finally, some of the reviews here say that there is yet another deeper level to this movie, that the whole thing is Mel Gibson's dream. Well, that is interesting, and may even be true, but it doesn't make this a better movie. It explains away the plot holes somewhat, but then it loses whatever spiritual message that it had. God didn't have a master plan for everyone and his wife's death was a senseless as ever. Why would that dream restore his faith?So, on the whole, not a good movie. It had good music, okay acting and a good production quality, but for what? 2/10 rating. Basically, disappointing.",Signs
383,Ricardo-36,What if God wrote Sci-Fi books (SPOILERS),8,25 September 2002,"-- WARNING SPOILERS --I've just seen ""Signs"", and while I was watching it, I knew it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors, I have seen his last 3 movies, and I loved every one of them. ""Signs"" is a very hard movie to understand. Its seems to be sci-fi, but with a little bit of horror/suspense on it. It's like ""Close Encounters"" meets ""Sixth Sense"".My favorite scene in the movie is the basement one. It was shot almost entirely in the dark, and we can only see fragments of sounds and images. And, amazingly, just like ""Blair Witch Project"", it works. Why? Well, because the whole suspense is in the audiences minds.I think you might find that interesting: as I was watching the movie, I kept trying to solve the movie's puzzle, the final surprise. I mean it's there, in every M. Night movie. And I thought that those were not aliens, but DEMONS or DEVILS or something. And what would make the demons go away would him getting back to his faith. I mean, watch the scene where he refuses to pray with his children when he is about to eat... And you'll see that my point of view could be right. What made the ""demons"" go away the first time? Mel Gibson's character, ""praying"" silently when his son is fighting to breath. And what made the ""demons"" go away the second time? Water. Why? I dunno, maybe because they live in hell or something, and just like fire would burn us, they get hurt by water...Anyway... I can only think of two persons who could try to film such a movie, Hitchcock and Kubrick. Hitchcock would probably not use some camera elements (as the ""in the ground"" shots), and would not use SFX as it is needed to create the mood, so it wouldn't work. Kubrick would probably use his ""parallel to the wall"" shots, and his face close-ups, and would NOT end the movie like that... So... maybe it wouldn't work. Maybe. Kubrick would surprise us in some other creepy way.Only M. Night could direct this movie. So... Let's just wait for his next one.",Signs
384,Sharkey360,Gibson + Schyamalan= GREAT MOVIE,10,31 August 2002,"Signs is another winning film from M. Night Schyamalan, one of the leading Asian directors in Hollywood today. Schyamalan, who already had a unique talent in film story telling since he was very young, once again has shown that very talent and strike gold in Hollywood with Signs.As a film, Signs is a very itriguing and very detailed suspense thriller story that has a good mix of sci-fi and horror elements. Signs takes a very close look at the ""crop cycles"" phenomenon of UFOs, a particular matter that had lacked attention in movies since most UFO movies prefer to look at the ""abduction"" scenario.As a Schyamalan film, I find Signs the best since the 1999 classic The Sixth Sense. There are many things about this movie that struck hard with attention and at the same time left me something to remember for a long time.Signs is also a great vehicle to have superstar Mel Gibson work together with the super talented Schyamalan. They both benefit each other's work ethics and at the same time add depth to the movie. Mel's acting is very good and has presented his character very well.Joaquin Phoenix is also good in this movie and complements well in the movie playing Gibson's brother. The 2 kids are also good.Schyamalan's style of filmmaking is of golden quality as usual, such as reflections on TV screens, suspense buildup and scary visuals. I also enjoyed seeing his cameo appearance in Signs, and despite being a known filmmaker, NOBODY in the movie theater here in the Philippines knew that the man they saw on screen is the director himself.Signs is a great movie and now I'm already waiting for the upcoming DVD release which I will surely go for!EXCELLENT MOVIE!",Signs
385,diztorted,Raises a fair question...do you believe in it or not?,10,9 August 2002,"Ok, lets see, I had the privilege of seeing this movie a few days ago. It was a strange experience, full of suspense, intrigue and smart dialogue (the kind of dialogue that makes you think or laugh sometimes), but I think the film has been misunderstood. The misunderstanding of the concept of the film is not the director's fault, not even the plot, it is merely a wrong interpretation from the advertising of the film. In a way it works, since the ads never prepare you for what you are going to see, which is good and surprising, but for a reason this is not sufficient for some people who are stuck in the idea of just seeing what the ads presented.
Once you see it, you will know that signs were not those huge things no one could explain, but other things more complicated that require your faith in a good director like Shyamalan to fall for it. Somewhere in the movie there's a scene in which the character played by Joaquim Phoenix asks Mel Gibson's character what he believes and Gibson says that there are always two different kinds of people, the believers and the skeptics. Taking those words, it is true, I found people hating this film and some other loving it, two groups, one believing and the others not. I take a stand on the first group, since I haven't found much movies this year that raises so many questions and makes you think more than once of what you just saw.",Signs

He's the next Alfred Hitchcock, a much better fit and a much better director to be compared with. Shyamalan doesn't seem to be the type who would hide a script so that only he could get his hands on it (as with Jaws). Nor would he lie about characters in his film (the origin of Indy's name). Nor would he blame others for the failure of one of his films (I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Hook, Goonies). Spielberg has done all of these things, and has lost any credibility he ever had, along with his story telling ability. No, Shyamalan will be more like Hitchcock, someone who knows how to weave an excellent tale without smarminess, pretentiousness or pointless screenplays. This is what CE3K should have been, rich in details that mean something. While Encounters was all pretty pictures and hollow characters, every scene in Signs added a layer to the climax, with people we could know. I won't spoil this wonderful film with any details. It covered a lot of different subjects while scaring me into silence during the last half. Like the best of Hitchcock's films, it will leave you a bit disturbed as you walk out of the theater. Very well done. RATING: 7 out of 10 on first look. Probably higher next time.",Signs
392,vocklabruck,It could have been a very good movie,4,7 October 2006,"I watched The Sixth Sense and also Unbreakable. I cannot believe the same director wrote and made Signs. The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece VERY NEAT, and I really loved Unbreakable but in comparison Signs is crap.I am really sad saying this but I have to admit it. The movie had potential but unfortunately it has a ton of plot holes. Why I cannot believe M. Night Shyamalan made this movie? Because the other two mentioned are extremely well done.I enjoyed the first 30 min. of the movie, then everything turned predictable, boring, nonsense. I liked the suspense moments and I think the movie is saved by the actors who played the family. I know it was not the best thing Mel Gibson did but it was OK, and I really liked the children. The problem in this movie is not the actors, but the plot holes.How can I child kill a furious dog and do not get injured one bit? How can that happen in total silence without screams? The father and the uncle did not hear anything? How can aliens come to a planet where the main element everywhere is the very thing that destroy them? How can a baby monitor receive signals from the aliens but the military radars are unable to do that? How can a family has a little girl suffering a mental disorder about water for years and take it as a normal thing without a treatment?OK... OK... I saw comments saying that this is not a sci-fi movie but a movie about faith. Anyway, a plot cannot have all those holes! I have tried to think of this movie in a metaphor way. I think that was the director's intention, but even in that case there is a non-sense thing everywhere, because in that case the movie should not be realistic in some scenes but it is.I give 4 stars to this movie, but it is only because I loved the actors performance, not all the actors, just the family...

394,DD-931,Signs of a Lazy Audience,7,27 August 2002,"When I left the theatre after seeing SIGNS, my first reaction was, ""What an incredibly accomplished build-up this movie had--and what a disappointing ending.""Having had time to think about it, I now see I did what a lot of people (including some in the user comments below and above) did.I didn't judge this movie on its own terms.This movie is not THE SIXTH SENSE.  It was not supposed to be THE SIXTH SENSE.  If people want another SIXTH SENSE, they're only deluding themselves.  There will never be another SIXTH SENSE.  So move on, people. If you want Shyamalan to just make the same movie over and over again, you are only wasting your time and his.  **SPOILERS AHEAD**Okay, I admit it.  When the aliens finally arrive, they are a failure. Although one person in the user comments came up with the ingenious explanation that what we saw were actually only bioengineered warriors working for the real aliens, the fact remains that reducing an alien encounter to extraterrestrial Morlocks looking for human food is not worthy of the superb buildup Shyamalan accomplished through the first three-quarters of the movie.  But maybe the point is, NO ending could be worthy of that build-up.Or maybe the point is, the movie wasn't about the aliens after all.**END OF SPOILER ALERT**This movie won't leave me alone because the response to it by so many people points out the big problem with movies today.The audience.How can filmmakers make ""the quality movies they USED to make"" when the audience won't let them?  Some people have pointed out that Shyamalan made the crisis of faith for the Mel Gibson character an alien invasion because that was the only way to get the audience to go see the movie.  I think it's more complex than that, because Shyamalan wanted the crisis of faith to concern a personal encounter with the ultimate challenge to faith, the end of the world.Still, the ball is being put in the audiences' court.  Do we want movies to affect us in personal ways anymore?  Do we want them to ask questions about deeper issues like faith, love, or the universe around us?  Or are we only out for the big bang now, and any movie that doesn't deliver that big bang makes us pout like toddlers.Some people want to dismiss this movie because it didn't ""deliver"".  But I can't.  I don't want to.This movie tries to say something about us.  Don't we want that from a movie anymore?",Signs

It didn't have to much in CGI or really good special effects but when you see the end it's really cool to see the Alien.

396,brainofj72,"A ""Less Is More"" Masterpiece",9,1 September 2005,"When I first saw this film in 2002, it was and still remains the only movie that has ever truly scared me. Of course, my taste has changed considerably since those days, so I recently decided to revisit the film. Upon rewatching it, I've found myself more impressed than I've ever been with this masterpiece.The story follows Graham Hess (Gibson), a former reverend torn apart by the loss of his wife; his two children Morgan (Culkin) and Bo (Breslin); and his brother, Merrill (Phoenix), a former minor league baseball star. This already stressed out family is put under a considerably heavier trial when they find mysterious patterns in their crops and are then tormented by the following alien invasion of Earth.""Signs"" is the perfect example of the ""less is more"" approach. Director M. Night Shyamalan builds the tension so expertly throughout the film using nothing but silence and clever camera angles that by the time the climax arrives my chest is about to explode. In fact, I have never seen another film that utilizes silence and shadows so well, it's really makes the film so scary for me. Anytime we see any part of the aliens, it's always so brief or obscured that we're never really sure what it was that we just saw.However, the film does contain some rather illogical flaws. For instance, why would a baby monitor pick up a sophisticated alien transmission? Why wouldn't the aliens cut the power supply while they were invading Earth? How could they have survived even a second in Earth's moist atmosphere if water kills them? But I, for one, was too enthralled in the story to care.Another thing I greatly appreciated in ""Signs"" was James Newton Howard's excellent score. It was not ubiquitous, cliché, or intrusive like the identical ""original"" scores in all the Hollywood fright films of late. It was there when it should have been and it wasn't when it shouldn't have been.But ""Signs"" is not just a frightening sci-fi film, it also a film about faith. Graham is a man struggling with his beliefs, which leads to a rather powerful scene toward the end of the film in which he must talk his son through a violent asthma attack while exclaiming ""I hate you!"" at God. Such scenes are also quite demanding from an acting standpoint, and the acting is capably handled by both of the leading men and also by the small band of supporting actors. Oh, this reminds me, keep your eyes open for a cool little cameo by Stella's Michael Showalter.On top of all this, the film also features beautiful, vivid cinematography and genuinely ingenious, fluid camera movements from Shyamalan.I guess ""Signs"" is one of those ""love it or hate it"" films, as I have heard lots of opinions on both sides of the spectrum and not too many in the gray area. As you have probably noticed, I am one of those who love it and I will watch and enjoy this excellent piece of cinema for years to come.9.5/10",Signs

""Signs"" is in no way a comedy, but there are deeply humorous images and dialog in this film that contribute much to the film without any detraction at all. Laughing out loud is more than a texting tic with ""Signs."" Characters are developed quite well and so deeply that you forget the actors and become engulfed in their characters. The director and his crew create a very believable, dimensioned world. Stories and back stories entwine seamlessly.The photography, lighting,and scoring combined into an atmospheric movie that caught my attention and never let go.

398,Roddy-15,An overrated insult to the intelligence,2,29 December 2003,"There are many movies out there that are extremely overrated. Sixth Sense, a masterpiece by writer-director M. Night Shyamalan, was overrated; it was good but not that good; it had many holes in the plot. However, when it comes to being overrated, Signs is in a category all by itself.Take away Mel Gibson and replace him with an unknown actor, and this is a B-movie. Take away the popularity of the man who directed it, and this film would have been as easily forgotten as Xtro and Not Like Us. The popularity that Sixth Sense enjoyed gave Signs one hell of a boost. The fact that Signs has a few scary scenes has swindled people into thinking this is a masterpiece when it comes to horror flicks.The movie is about a group of aliens making crop circles around a farmer's cornfield. Later in the film, we find out that these aliens, who so far are behaving like pranksters from outer space, are planning to invade Earth. Apparently making crop circles is their idea of warning people that an attack is coming. Imagine American troops tracing crop circles around Iraqi farms, and you get the picture.One of Signs' scariest moments takes place when a group of kids at a birthday party see an alien walking down the street. The shocking footage is filmed by someone at the birthday party. Horrifying indeed. But if you use a little logic, you immediately realize that the alien is walking around naked and without weapons. So they are planning to invade Earth naked and weaponless? Suddenly bigfoot seems a little scarier, and the aliens in Independence Day, who were dumb enough to not know about antivirus software, seem a lot smarter.Spoilers ahead, and I mean real spoilers:Eventually the invasion begins. This is the point where an alien breaks into Mel Gibson's farm. Yes, attacking farms is an alien's idea of a planetary war; it seems the aliens are in desperate need of corn. But Mel Gibson and his family are going to fight back. They get in the cellar and lock the door. Apparently these aliens can travel faster than light, but they don't have firearms, and they are afraid of locked, wooden doors.Then, early in the morning, the alien seems to be gone. It seems the alien is afraid of sunlight. When the family, who has been through one hell of an ordeal, turns on the television, they realize that not just one but all of the aliens are gone. Why? Because humans discovered that water can harm them. Yes, water can harm them. Yet they were stupid enough to walk around naked. Imagine a group of nudists hanging around a lava-marinated volcanic eruption, and you get the logic of this.The scariest thing about Signs is the fact that not even movie critics saw all the holes it has.",Signs
399,piksplanet,Outstanding film-making. Period!,10,23 June 2008,"Signs is a 2002 science fiction thriller film written, produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It was one of the highest grossing movies of that particular year, and garnered critical acclaim worldwide. The film stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin. Shayamalan himself also has a small, yet crucial, role in the film.Signs is a more personal take on a worldwide event. The film delves into certain events that really occurred, giving them a science fiction turn (Read: The crop circles which caused a worldwide uproar in the 1970's). Once again, like most Shayamalan movies, Signs is visually terrific! It's edge of the seat value is off the chart. The film has as little plot as possible, and all of its time is concentrated on building up the characters. The fear and the tension it creates is the work of a master film-maker. There are no flashy special effects. It is all Tak Fujimoto's moving photography; and an outstanding background score from Howard Newton Shore, which, without changing its main tune, is both scary and comforting. Straight from the opening credits, Signs is, simply put, a work of art.Whether it is the sudden shot of a figure standing on the rooftop in the darkness, the sound of a dog barking, the sound of the wind, a thump, a reflection - everything is done perfectly in order to create something scarier than any blood-and-guts gore movie you've ever seen. The sequence at the Brazilian kid's Birthday party - I almost ran out of the theatre after seeing it. Like the newscaster puts it, ""What you are about to see may disturb you."" I cannot put into words how brilliant a movie Signs is.10/10!",Signs
400,druss44121-1,Still one of my favorites,9,19 November 2019,"This is the only film I've ever seen 5 times in theaters. I saw Gladiator 4 times (once while traveling overseas). Everything else has been 3 or less. More than 15 years later and it's still one of my favorites.The real reason this film works is because it's a character drama first and a thriller second. The supernatural aspects are just window dressing. Like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, M. Night's best films work because you care about the characters and are drawn into their stories. He basically tricks audiences into eating their veggies; you're watching character dramas about human beings struggling with very real human issues. Usually those sorts of films don't exactly light up the box office. The genre supernatural stuff is just the cherry on top.With that said, it amazes me that people still lambast this film for plot holes that *aren't* actually plot holes. This film is very well thought out, and all of the little details that are put into it do in fact add up to something. I'll have to venture into spoiler territory now...***SPOILERS FOR THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE AND SIGNS***M. Night films are know for their twists. Yes, he's almost ventured into parody territory over the years with these surprise endings, but when they work, they work exceptionally well. Signs I think has the most subtle twist, and in many ways it is his most powerful ending.Essentially, M. Night uses genre tropes to draw you into a world, and then he flips those tropes around. So in The Sixth Sense, you think you're watching a movie about scary ghosts, and then at the end you realize you've been watching it mostly from the perspective of the ghost. In Unbreakable, you realize at the end that you've been watching a superhero origin story all along. Signs follows a similar pattern. You think it's a story about an alien invasion, but then at the end you realize you've actually been watching a movie about the apocalypse. And like Unbreakable, the film isn't really shy about letting you know what is really going on. Unbreakable has comicbooks as a major aspect of the storyline before the reveal, just as Signs has religion/faith/God as major story points before the reveal.I'm not the only person who has figured this out, mind you. You can google ""Signs demon theory"" and plenty of other people point out the clues (er, signs?) throughout the film. Which brings me to my original point: water doesn't kill the aliens. There's no plot hole here. They aren't aliens. And it's not just water, it's holy water specifically that burns and kills the demon in the ending scene. Yes, you might think it's cheesy, but I think the movie earns it. You care about the characters. You care about their state of mind. The entire story builds up to this very specific moment.And just in case you aren't sold or think I'm trying to write M. Night out of a hole, keep this in mind: Bo is referred to as ""like an angel"". The water that kills the demon is her water, it's not just any water. More importantly, the TV mentions that a primitive method has been discovered in ""three Middle Eastern cities."" Last I checked, the Middle East wasn't exactly know for an abundance of water. However, it is the birthplace of the three major Abrahamic religions, and the River Jordan is even considered holy. If it was just any old water that killed the ""aliens"" wouldn't a solution be found first in Seattle or Mawsynram or something?The fact that they're demons is even more obvious when you think of the fact that they look demonic (with their cloven feet, etc.) and are running around naked. Even the crop signs themselves look like a pitchfork, which is admittedly maybe a bit too much on the nose. You also never see a spaceship once. This is purposeful from a writing and directing standpoint. Lights in the sky could reference portals or gateways. It has nothing to do with interstellar space travel, that's just something the characters and audience infer before they have all of the facts. The only time the word ""alien"" is actually mentioned is when they're wearing tinfoil hats. That joke isn't for nothing!Keep in mind, M. Night was raised as a Hindu himself (but went to Catholic school) and Signs in many ways plays with tropes from both Christianity and Hinduism. Think of the asuras, powerful superhuman demigods in Hinduism who are often considered ""enemies of the gods"". Wasn't there even a line in Batman v Superman about demons coming from the sky? Signs is an apocalypse story in the same way that Unbreakable is a superhero origin story or Split is an Unbreakable spinoff/sequel. You don't realize it until the end when all the pieces of the puzzle come together.So TL;DR version: Signs is a great character drama about the apocalypse (remember: apocalypse means revelation). A family struggles with grief and has to fend off demons during humanity's darkest hour. There aren't any gaping plot holes, either. Water doesn't kill aliens, but rather holy water kills demons.

I like them all a lot, but this one is just a cut above the rest in my opinion. In the same way that Sixth Sense is the horror movie that isn't and Unbreakable is the super hero movie that isn't, Signs is the alien movie that isn't.Early in the movie, Graham Hess (Gibson) find something unusual in his fields. Crop circles. Is it a hoax? Is it a practical joke by somebody in the town? What made the circles? Graham's children, Bo and Morgan both believe right away that they were made by something not human, but Graham and his brother Merrill (Phoenix) have their doubts. Crop circles? It has to be a hoax, right? Then other things start happening. The dogs start acting strangely. Bo comes to Graham in the middle of the night and claims that there is a monster outside of her room. Graham and Merrill go outside to scare the intruder off. They chase him around the house, but when they meet on the other side, the intruder is on the roof. How? Then more odd things happen. Graham finds someone, or something, walking around in his cornfield. Alien signals get picked up through baby monitors. Lights are floating in the sky all across the world. Eventually Graham and Merrill drop their doubt and admit that there are aliens out there.The movie has a very claustrophobic atmosphere. Most of the movie takes place on the Hess farm. But it works. In the cramped atmosphere, we feel just as trapped as the Hess family. Shrouded in confusion and fear, unsure of what exactly is going to happen.I won't tell you how they get rid of the aliens, but it is hardly in a conventional manner. This movie sharply contrasts movies like Independence Day where aliens come in big spaceships with big guns to blow up the world. Instead they come with ground troops and strategy.This movie is well acted and cleverly written, and it is one of my favorite movies.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",Signs
402,scotty-37,A well-made and interesting movie,9,22 August 2002,"This movie is one of the more original movies of 2002.  If you like this movie you'll probably like it a lot and if you want a standard horror/blood/slasher movie you'll probably dislike it since it isn't a standard hollywood no-brainer.I'm not going to bother summarizing since there are plenty of summaries elsewhere.GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE:Joaquin Pheonix as the brother, Cherry Jones as Officer Caroline Paski, the child actors, Mel Gibson in one of his better roles, Less-is-more approach, good script that rewards paying attention to details, lots of funny moments, lots of suspenseful moments, lots of subtle nuances, letting your imagination fill in the scary parts, well thought-out script and interconnectedness, the baby monitor, scary noises & good soundtrack, not overwhelmed by special effects.BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIERory Culkin had a few bad moments, not everything is explained and you have to figure some things out for yourself (this is good or bad depending on how you look at it), the director making an appearance as Ray Reddy (not too bad, but his acting was not quite as good as some of the other people), a long build-up of suspense that some people may be bored with (I loved it though).",Signs
403,youngsteve,Weird,3,7 February 2004,"Even though I have just seen this film, I still haven't the foggiest what the hell it's about. The basic premise of aliens invading is okay, but these must be the most inept or peculiar ever. Ignoring the fact that they are up to no good, yet again, (why can't they be normal like ET, as a superior species might be) these seem to be the only invading force anywhere without military might or weapons, but just use a bit of gas & their superior presence to bowl people over. But they haven't figured on a glass of water. Oh my!!!The acting is good, particularly the two leads, but they are all lost in a tedious script & surprisingly little action or tension, which could have been better as an episode of Outer Limits or Twilight Zone.3/10",Signs
404,illegal_alien51,Move along folks! Nothing to see here!!,1,2 May 2004,"My 3 of 10 points go to Mel Gibson and his co-workers. That's it, other than that I have mostly criticism if you're interested:*Spoilers*1. The story was dragging along in an awfully slow pace.2. There was not actually much happening in the movie.3. There was a lot going on that didn't really give this movie any more substance4. The constant talk about ""There is no coincidence"" started to really get irritating, and the sentences ""Swing away"" and ""His lungs were closed"" really drove this to the edge of utter irritation. Because if that was to be the movies main point, then it was a really boring one!5. Whenever there was action to be expected you saw it from an angle from which you actually saw the least! In the cellar you saw 20 seconds of ""flashlight on dirty ground"" whilst the guys struggled to free the boy, -22345 points for that. Mostly in the fighting scene in the living room, you saw the bat, not the beaten one, -362344 points for that.6. In general did this movie have about the worst shots I've ever seen! I think the film makers didn't wanna waste time on cutting up scenes into smaller 2 second bits like it usually would be done in many places, so when Mel Gibson talked to the woman who was playing his wife, you end up seeing him first for about 10 seconds and THEN FINALLY when you think you're never going to see her face, the camera switches angles and shows her face too. There were very many shots like that where not only the camera angles were extremely irritating but also what was filmed did not always seem to be the best choice. Whoever made the screenplay for this movie or decided what to shoot should really go back to film school! I could really and honestly have done that better myself!7. Did you too notice that it seems as if we viewers were supposed to see as little of the aliens as possible? The first one is locked in a room and all you see is his fingers. The next bunch is again not in the same room as the camera and the rest of the people and when finally that single alien was in the middle of the room, the room had somehow become very dark - at least where the alien was standing - eventho it had actually been quite bright a minute before when the boy was on the couch next to where the alien now stood. It really seemed to me as if we were only to know that there were aliens, but we were not supposed to see them! CHEAP!8. I found the story one of the most boring they could have made out of that topic. I would have rather seen this movie take some kind of direction a bit like ""Contact"" did. Maybe that Gibson was a scientist investigating crop circles who had started to kind of figure out some meaning and then maybe would have made one of his own that made sense to the aliens and that way gotten in contact with them... or anything else, but not a priest who doesn't wanna be a priest who has children which run around with aluminium foil hats all day and a brother who cant play baseball and a wife who died and said some delirious things when she passed away... TIRESOME AND DISAPPOINTING!9. Of course this wasn't really illogical, but common... people in the Middle East being the ones to discover that the aliens don't like water? I mean... is that the first thing people in the Middle East would do? Spray water on aliens? As I said, it's not unlikely and I know that there too is water in the Middle East, but I would have found it a bit more likely for somebody else to come up with that, maybe people from South America or anything like that. Well well... this was just another of those more odd things that don't make you wanna watch this movie again.Move along folks! Nothing to see here!!",Signs
405,black_wolf_1970,Not an invasion movie,4,18 March 2005,"OK this movies had so many subplots in it i was lost before the aliens even became mentioned. The death of the wife by a DWI driver, him just happening along at that time her dying words the psychic kids, the dunce brother the REV lost faith being a REV at the end, the luck that the kid had a asthma attack so he did not die of the alien gas attack, the story jumped around to much tried to be funny, scary, mysterious a love story all at the same time and none of it worked. SCARY MOVIE #3 was a heck of a lot better. and if the aliens were so advanced way one no guns, had to use circles in fields to set up their attack what no radios either, how did the ships talk to each other, flashes of light. I am a spiritual man and was some what pleased by that side of the story but give me a break what was this about and I hope they never never try a sequel, it will ruin this one for those he liked it and those of us who did not will turn up our noses even before seeing it. Fo those who liked this movie I am glad and I hope i did not up set you, for those who did not, don't put them down who did.",Signs
406,fiozinho,Lazy,4,27 October 2002,"'Signs' is a lazy film. It goes through the motions. It borrows (steals?) from any number of other films of its type. The performances, apart from the kids (Shyamalan = Spielberg?) are strictly perfunctory. The effects are weedy. Its pay-off is extremely weak. In fact, the film has nothing going for it except the reputation of its director ... but this cannot be anything other than seriously dented. The man surely can't produce another 'twist in the tale' story like this ... can he?",Signs
407,cToTh-2,Excellent,10,30 August 2002,"Normally I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson, but I must admit that this was one excellent movie.  I did not regret seeing this one at the movie theatre, unlike some of the other releases from this year.We've got a movie that combines two other similar stories:  ""The Arrival"" and ""Independence Day.""  Upon seeing the movie, it is kind of obvious of the similarities with ID4, but it does not go overboard.  The movie is not heavily sci-fi nor is it heavy on (unrealistic) action.  Signs is in fact a very suspenseful and exciting movie, more of a nail-biter than a rock-em-sock-em type movie.With regards to ""The Arrival,"" we've got some covert activities performed by the aliens.If I had to pick out one of the most unlikely/unbelievable parts of the movie, I would have to consider the lack of government conspiracies. Today's modern myths and legends include government cover-ups, alien autopsies, conspiracies, etc.  And it is commonly believed that there must be a core of truth buried beneath myths and legends.  So why wasn't the government trying to cover up the crop circles or block media broadcasts?Classic examples include:  Roswell, the X-Files (the Mulder years, of course), Men in Black (NOT the movies), etc.SPOILER ALERT...All in all, the movie was excellent, except for the ending.  The ending was weak.  I guess it goes to show you that our water may not be as pure as we think (to take a different approach than the average reviewer)...  If it comes down to a true alien invasion, a superior (technological) race should not be beaten by sticks and water.  These guys did not appear to be the tiny, weak, large-headed aliens you see on Stargate SG1.This movie will be added to my collection once it is made available.",Signs

409,LarryBrownHouston,"Total crap, an utter waste of time. The surface action is dumb and the deeper message is dumber.",1,27 April 2009,"SPOILER ALERT Many reviewers here complained about the ridiculous plot holes and I agree. It's full of holes.I see a lot of movies and I will walk if it looks lousy. There's 20+ movies to choose from, why waste time on a lousy one? If I hear lame dialog, a trite or cliché script, if I roll my eyes more than twice, I'm outta there. If the writer and director are lousy, they're not going to get any better. An exception to this is when they hire another writer or director after firing the lame one. An example of this is ""The Muppets Take Manhattan,"" where the first half is lousy, but the second half is good and even great in some parts.I walked on ""Signs"" after about 40 minutes and didn't look back. However, a family member insisted that it was good and all came together in the end, so I went back and watched the entire movie, start to end. Boy was I sorry, I should have stayed away.The movie is ridiculous on various levels, but besides that, it has nothing worthwhile to offer.As soon as the aliens came into the story, I was able to accurately predict the entire story: Aliens may or may not be here. As the movie progresses, the evidence of the aliens becomes more pronounced until we begin to see glimpses of them. From there we will go into the climax where we have a showdown with the aliens and win. That's a synopsis of the plot and who, I mean who, is going to say there is anything at all original about that? No one over the age of 13.The movie plays out just as I predicted. But there's some quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo thrown in there that's really the point of the story. Fine, the only problem is that the mumbo-jumbo is so utterly ridiculous that it's laughable.Unless I'm missing something (unlikely), the plot is this: God causes Gibson's wife to get horribly injured in an accident where she suffers in agony until Gibson can get there, whereupon she delivers a coded message from God to Gibson, without Gibson realizing it, and then she dies. This accident causes Gibson to lose his faith in God. Meanwhile, God has caused another family member that is a budding baseball star to suffer an injury and his career and life are ruined. Then, God causes the kid to have an irrational preoccupation with water, resulting in half glasses of water being left all over the house. Then, God causes all these circumstances to work together during an alien invasion of earth such that the coded message, the water, and the sports career work together to defeat the aliens in the house and save lives. Gibson sees how God has wrought all of this and regains his faith. If that's it, that's the most utterly ridiculous, blasphemous, lame, contrived, etc story I've ever heard of.So I'm wondering two things: 1: Is my understanding of the story complete and my laughter is justified, or did I miss something? And 2: How on earth did the guy that wrote the brilliant ""The 6th Sense"" write this load of tripe? It would seem that his contract with the movie studio includes a ""right of subcontract"" and he subcontracted his swimming pool cleaning guy to write this.",Signs

This is one of them. Oh yes, I've heard the reasons people don't like it. Why would the aliens come to a planet with water? Well, why did man go to the moon? It was deadly for us, too. (They came for its people, and steered clear of the water.) How come the alien couldn't get out of the pantry? (Uh, because it was locked in and the door was hard and thick. - And even if they could travel through space further than us, it doesn't mean they are stronger.) I'm guessing some people don't like it because of its religious theme, and these are just excuses to rag on it. Was it all a coincidence? Perhaps. Was it a higher being aka God? The audience can decide for itself. Personally, I think it was excellently written and acted. (And pretty darned creepy in places.)

414,cat-that-goes-by-himself,How melting little green men helped Mel's make-good-with-God,1,6 September 2006,"This movie should be rated TB (for True Believers only). Sorry if I hurt a few feelings here, but frankly my atheist perception of this movie was it being an incredibly feeble, childish collection of wistful thoughts about divine power. The story sacrificed about everything that makes IMHO a watchable movie on the altar of this unique goal.I guess a true believer will deem unimportant the blatant psychological inconsistencies riddling the script. I don't even feel like elaborating on the main character's struggles with faith: the lowest grade of basic emotional tricks you find in about half the movies shot since the invention of cinema, only very poorly used and with the subtlety of an elephant in a china store. Even the poor dog seems unable to maintain even a roughly credible behavior. His turning against the children must have been caused by alien poisoning - a metaphor for being possessed by the Demon, no doubt.As we say in France, this movie is only preaching the already converted. Frankly, why go and fetch aliens to put forth the fact that having a child with a bad asthma and another obsessed with decorating the house with half-filled water glasses was all manifestations of divine wisdom? That seemed incredibly contrived, irrelevant, pointless. It left me wondering what pains the director went through to come up with something a major would buy:hey guys, I got a script all about faith and predestination. We should win about 90% of the baptist audience with that. Plus all the clichés on the ideal white American family getting together to overcome the ordeals of life, that should grab a solid share of the corn- and bible belt. Not counting the Gibson right wing fan base. Now will you buy that? not good enough what if I throw in some aliens? What if they melt in water and spit poison from their wrists and get their fingers cut with cooking knifes, mmm? Mmm... That should scrape enough little kids, X-files nostalgics and nerds plus a couple of UFO freaks to round the profit margin. OK, that's a deal!Dear oh dear, what a world we are living in...P.S: and just to prevent misunderstandings with the Shyamalan zealots, I got the ""it was all just a dream"" thing.

Both were films riddled with plot holes that finished with cheesy endings and were supposed to have some sort of ""deeper meaning."" And by the end of both films, I was glad I had only spent less than $5 each on renting them.Signs had all sorts of problems - so many that I won't list all but one - the biggest problem of them all. But this is a major spoiler, so stop here if you don't want to be spoiled.BEGIN SPOILER AND PLOT HOLEWater is poisonous to the aliens. So why would they invade Earth (which is at least 2/3 made of water), run around in crop circles (plants on Earth are full of water), and harvest humans for their meals (humans are at least 3/4 made of water).

416,evilasahobby,"Excellent spiritual brother to ""Independence Day""",8,17 March 2003,"M. Night Shyamalan's films always impress me and have gotten better as time goes on. ""The Sixth Sense"" was good, but relied heavily on the ending to raise it above the normal supernatural thriller. ""Unbreakable"" was superb with an ending that justifies the events of the movie. ""Signs"" follows this trend, this time using space aliens and UFOs as the vehicle to deliver the film's message.*Some spoilers below*As with all Shyamalan's films, in order to accept the film the audience must accept the world view (typically a supernatural theme in a real world environment) that the narrative is putting across. Don't believe in ghosts? ""The Sixth Sense"" was probably a waste of time for you. Think comic books are stupid? ""Unbreakable"" probably won't rock your world. If you can't accept the concept of aliens arriving on Earth and making crop circles, then you probably won't enjoy ""Signs"".""Signs"" really reminded me of ""Independence Day"", shrunk to the personal level. For the ordinary man, taking on the alien hordes in a Raptor while building a computer virus on an Apple computer is inconceivable. Hiding in your basement isn't. The Hess family react in an understandable fashion when confronted with the unknown - they hide in their house. Everything is kept on the small and personal level, which makes the audience become so much more involved. Forget saving the world - Mel Gibson's character is just trying to save his family.""Signs"" also contains an atmosphere of creepy tension that is uncommon and hugely effective. Shyamalan obeys the golden rule of creature suspense - don't let the audience see the creature until the last moment. The unknown is much more fear-inducing than anything that CGI can cook up, with ""Signs""' use of the unknown and half-seen being among the best I have seen on film. Revealing the alien at the end is a bit of a let down, but does give the film it's climax.At it's heart ""Signs"" does contain a message about faith that is delivered in a reasonably un-preachy way. I hate having feel-good messages rammed down my throat, but ""Signs"" doesn't do that; the faith message is important to the characters' motivations in the film rather than a message for all of us to live by. The audience can take away what it wants.As can be seen by other comments, ""Signs"" has a lot of detractors. Personally it was great to see an alien film where the US doesn't have all the answers and kicks the aliens off the planet just in time for the romantic leads to get together. Imagine - a film where some other country other than the US finds a way to repel the aliens first.
In regards to what the aliens can and can't do, or what they should or shouldn't have thought - we don't know. That's a huge part of the film - the aliens remain alien, unknown and inhuman. Who knows why they did what they did or what they could do?""Signs"" is a worthy film to the Shyamalan film catalogue - I can't wait to see what his next release is, supernatural thriller or not.",Signs

That is the degree to which the tension builds in this film.And before continuing, I should like to address the elements many of this film's detractors seem to have seized upon. First, this is not a science fiction film per se. It's not at all about the infamous crop circles about which many Star Trek fans would probably love to see a speculative plot written. Indeed, the science of the story is, at best, somewhat dubious.But trust me, you won't care. 'Signs' is about fear and it's about faith and it's about how difficult it is to confront the former without the latter. And what this director knows, and what so many other directors don't, is that the greatest fear is the fear of the unknown. It's the fear of what you think you see in a split second of videotape. It's the fear of what you think you're hearing just above the static on your baby monitor radio. The fear of what you think is on the other side of the door.This film will have you yearning to crawl into the upholstery of your theatre seat to hide. And unless you want them to have a total nervous breakdown, I'd say leave the kids under 8 at home.It's not a masterwork, but it definitely accomplishes what it sets out to do.See it.

Night Shyamalan's movies, and this one started out decent, and then got seriously dull and boring just like his other movies. that scene where the alien just walks by for a second at the birthday party was the stupidest scene in a horror film ever. how that scene managed to be #77 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I'll never know. Speaking of which, Rory Culkin, who acted in the film, was on that Bravo Special talking about the film, and it seemed that this movie stupefied him. he was talking like he was possessed, saying stuff like ""the family gets crop circles...in their crops...and it's aliens..."" i think the dumbest part in the movie was it's ""climax"" . it was a HUGE disappointment. i figured that Mel Gibson or Joaquin Phoenix would get a gun or something and blow the heads off those aliens, but no. the aliens are so weak and defenseless that they can be trapped behind a weak wooden door and get burned by A GLASS OF WATER. so this space creature can operate a spaceship, make circles about a mile wide in someone's backyard, but gets killed by a glass of water. Wow. I didn't know Shymalan's movies would sink THIS low. if you want to see a good alien movie, see ""Day the earth Stood Still"" or ""Independence day"", or MAYBE EVEN ""Mars attacks!"".

424,asiduodiego,How to ruin a good suspense film.,5,7 February 2019,"Signs is quite an effective suspense movie. The tone is ominous, the acting is reserved and it really creates a good ambiance, which makes the movie feels very intriguing. M. Night Shyamalan is a good director creating these types of environments, and I think, this is one of his best efforts.(spoilers)But, alas, the movie mysteries need to be resolved. And the resolution of all the interesting themes is just a ridiculous, forced and unconvincing Deus Ex Machina. Many have argued that the point of the movie is not ""an alien invasion"" but ""a man struggling and recovering his faith"". Fair enough, but even then, the resolution is completely forced. So, in the end, God caused (or allowed) the car accident that killed Mel Gibson's wife just for she to save their family in an alien invation, by giving some vague advice about telling Joaquin Phoenix to swing a bat on these guys?. Please, read again those last sentences. It is completely forced and ridiculous, and it completely kills the movie.The thing is, this can be a good movie, as long as you don't think about it very much, and I think that's the reason it initally received good critiques. It's a thrilling ride, but the resolution makes everything to be pointless and ridiculous. Perhaps in some cases, it's the journey that counts, but in this case, the destination is just so forced and stupid, that it ruins everything.In my opinion, this movie has value. It's interesting to watch, and it has some very tense and scary moments. It's just that the resolution of the plot is so, so poor, that it makes it all pointless in the end.5/10",Signs
425,j30bell,Mad Mel's Mrs DiesAgain! (This is not a spoiler),6,13 October 2006,"You know, you'd have to be seriously worried if you were Mel's wife in film. Black men in 1970s action flicks have a more tenacious grip on life. At least they generally cark it at the end of the film, gallantly laying down their lives when victory is at hand so the goody-goody white boy can ride off into the white-only sunset with a tasty bit of crumpet.Mel's wives/girlfriends/love interests rarely make it past the opening credits.Yep, Mad Mel has lost his Mrs and is mean as hell. But this time its god he's p* ssed with. Can even Mad Mel mess with the messiah? Sure he can.Oh, and there are some aliens as well Ho Hum.Signs is the third of the almost invariably enjoyable M Night Shyamalan films. It is a long way from being his best.This is not, as many have said, because the film contains little in the way of ""twist"". Last time I checked, many great films had no twist at all and were still great. And Shyamalan's style is far more dependent on building suspense than pulling an unusually coloured rabbit out of the hat at the end of the last real. But such is the joy of Hollywood. Make one film with a great twist, and be forced to repeat it.Shyamalan once again does a great job with suspense. Once again, family is integral to the plot. But the real core of this film is faith. Mel, you see, has a dead Mrs, and he knows who's responsible. Apparently, it's none other than god. Phwewee, somebody's gonna get hurt. Reeeal Bad! Okay, this is mildly diverting for a while. Mystic Mel does a pretty good job of the whole ""I'm not wasting another moment of my life on prayer"" thing. Possibly the pain of him having to say these lines happily coincided with the pain of the character. Or am I being cynical? Mel can certainly act when he can be bothered, as he frequently showed  sometime south of 1986.The supporting cast is also superb. Joachim Phoenix is excellent, as are the two kids. Cherry Jones does an excellent job as the benevolent, Fargo-esquire local copper shorn of all the Coenisms.There was some great comedy. Mel walking into his living room to find Joachim and the two kids on the sofa with two boxes of bacofoil on their heads was a fantastic touch. And, dare I say it, Mel's personal leitmotif  the untimely demise of his better half  left a genuine lump in my throat.But there are two fundamental problems with the film.The first is the aliens. They just get in the way. Okay, they provide the basis for the suspense. Okay, there are some interesting parallels to be drawn between faith in god and the nutters out looking for aliens in prairie country. And I suppose the fact that the nutters are right in Signs adds some significance to Mel's own character development. But I can't help thinking that it is attempting to juxtapose the essentially frivolous with the deadly serious - and not very well  The Village does it much better. So, in M Night's film the nutters are right. But we all know (don't we?) that in reality, they're just nutters. So is it an apt metaphor or just all hogwash? The second problem is the finale. I'm biased possibly but to me it just didn't make sense. ""The Lord Giveth and the Lord Taketh Away  seemingly on the basis of his own personal whimsy"". I'm not convinced that this is a good basis for the massive character shift undergone by Melvine the Terrible, and you're left with the conclusion that either he's not a very clear thinker at all, or he's been throwing a rather childish tantrum for most of the rest of the film. Neither lend the script credibility.Watch the Village is my recommendation. It's a massively under-estimated film (possibly Shyamalan's best). In many respects it is a half-remake of Signs, and is somehow less trite.A minor work of a very good filmmaker. 6/10.",Signs

428,MacaulayConnor,The Horror -Spoilers,4,18 September 2002,"As most people I have seen the two previous movies by this very promising director. And now I have to ask myself: is he done already? ""Signs"" was very disappointing compared (of course) to ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". It just seems to be such a mixture...Major Spoilers ahead: Maybe it would have worked without the appearance of the Ufos all over the world. I think it is much scarier when you and your family are the only one who notice the invasion. But the way Shyalaman wrote it, it´s obvious that the world is visited by aliens and the audience is just guessing all the time: why are aliens using theses signs navigating on earth when they have done all the very, very long way through our galaxy without them? Why don´t they use any weapons? Why is there no chaos in the streets and evacuation like shown in ID4? And how can one possibly trying to avoid invasion by aliens by just blocking doors and windows? Don´t aliens use tools? How do they build their spacecrafts? And is it clever to invade a world of 70% water and kidnapping people consisting of 70% water when you wind up dead by the pure contact of water to your skin? (There is a french fun movie from the 70s with Louis de Funès with aliens you react just the same way.)So I´d go with ONE sign, ONE ship and crew probing the neighborhood of Mel´s house and with the horror of being attacked without the sheriff and townfolks believing me... and by the way: Gibson can´t act at all...stick to WillisBetter luck next time, ´nuff said, Night!Macaulay J.

432,McHuevo,Suspense the way it was meant to be,8,16 September 2002,"I have to admit it: M. Night Shyamalan is becoming the new master of suspense. He has already proved it with ""The sixth sense"", but now with ""Signs"" it looks like he's bringing his skills to perfection. The tension goes from zero to infinity in a perfect pace during the movie. I honestly didn't expect ""Signs"" to be that scary from what I saw in the trailer, but fortunately I was completely wrong. Many think that ""The sixth sense"" is Shyamalan's master piece, but I say it's still to come.In ""Signs"" we get to see, finally, a non-psychotic Mel Gibson without a gun. He plays now a very peaceful, and depressed, ex-priest Graham Hess who has lost his faith. He lives with his two children and his brother Merrill played nicely by Joaquin Phoenix. The three of them bring the necessary (and almost too many) comic reliefs to the movie. You have to have a laugh between those moments of sheer terror. Moments that are mainly created by your imagination; it's the typical ""Oh no, don't go in there! Run! No, not that way! What's going to happen now?!"". This is the type of movie that doesn't work in a TV. You need to be surrounded by a crowd ready to wet their pants and, most importantly, you need the sound of a cinema theater: the movie relies a lot on the sound FX to build up the tension (something I really loved). What I did not like about the movie is that in the end it's not about giant circles in crop fields, and it's not about alien invasions; it's all about father Graham and his faith. I think that's the reason I see so many plot holes, which I will not mention here; I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen this movie... and have actually read this review.

The film again is very exciting and i know M. Night Shyamalan could make horror films just as frighting as Hitchcock. (Even though Shyamalan screwed up with The Village and Lady in the Water). One of the best bits i've seen in a horror film ever is the T.V. report from Brazil when you first see an alien. But before you even see an alien Shyamalan kept you on the edge of your seat. The film could have got a rating of 10 out of 10 but mistakes such as water can kill an alien,But wouldn't they realize most of earth is water. Another mistake is that they left their dog out to die,And i own a dog and if i was in that situation i would keep my dog safe.

The first philosophy, one which ultimately prevailed, included the coincidences which gave Mel Gibson the clues (signs) to understand the conflict he was in, both with the aliens and himself.  We understand he ultimately won when he put the collar on at the end of the film. All of the clues are spread out: his wife's last message, his daughter's water obsession, his son's asthma, his brother's skill with (and seeming obsession with) a bat and inability to not swing, the clue from M.

It seems to do it's best to be ""trendy"" and ""modern"" while at the same time totally failing to be anything origional let alone groundbreaking.The one good moment in this film is where you catch first glimpse of one of the aliens walking past an alley. The low points are during the ""blair witch"" scene in the basement, and the ""day of the triffids"" ending. The aliens themselves are not remotely believable. Not due to special effects, but due to their incredible stupidity and their lack of both judgement and planning.

442,politicon2003,The Bogey Man;s in the Closet!,1,18 May 2009,"I am so glad I didn't buy this miserable work but recorded it from TV. At least I can erase the tape. Making a good science-fiction movie is always challenging and only a few such as the producers of Gattaca have succeeded. This particular movie does not even come up to the less than average standard of Sci-fi B films of the 1950s and 1960s.Why didn't I like it? Basically it was a waste of time for the two fine lead actors Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The script and lines given them were just awful. Banal doesn't adequately describe them.A married priest (Gibson) ceases to believe in God and throws away his dog collar after his wife is terribly injured and dies as a result of a traffic accident caused by a neighbour who was had fallen asleep at the wheel of his panel truck. (How the priest becomes a born again Christian seems to be the film's only theme). It does not explain his nastiness to his young son (he also has a cute little daughter). He has a grown up kid brother (Phoenix) who is a former baseball star (don't forget that last part because it's vital for the movie's end). The kid brother has moved into the barn like cottage adjacent to their Pennsylvania corn farm, after the priest's wife dies, so as to keep him company.The Signs are the several neat circles the kids discover in the cornfield. More of them are contained in -of all things - a Sci-fi novel about alien invaders that the young son is reading. It seems all too obvious that aliens are at work because the local young hooligans are incapable of drawing perfect circles let alone carving them into the corn. The family's pet dog is apparently attacked by an alien and dies. They don't call the vet to attend to the injured dog because, guess what, as is revealed a bit later, the vet is the fellow who fell asleep at the panel truck's wheel.Nor only is the script banal and the plot very thin and obvious but the scenes just drag on and the movie seems a lot longer than its 108 minutes with not much happening. One only catches sight of an alien bogey man during the last thirty minutes or so. Its first appearance is in a Brazilian newscast that freaks out the priest's brother who is watching the TV. The local alien bogey man later appears in vivo in the priest's family den after the family has boarded up doors and windows (remember that happened also in Hitchcock's The Birds). Indeed, the producers don't seem to have made up their minds as to whether the movies should have been a pure sci-fi or a horror movie. It succeeds in neither genre.There is a slight twist at the end where their own alien is whacked thanks to some cryptic words the priest's dying wife utters in a flashback as Mel Gibson hovers over her body at the scene of the accident. The twist is actually quite clever and I shan't reveal it for the benefit of those who might like this movie. As in H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds and every other Sci-fi tale or movie about alien invaders, they always have a fatal weakness, if you can discover it.The quality of the movie is not even redeemed by any exceptional cinematographic special effects or lavish period settings and costumes. As the movies is set in 2002, the adults dwelling in the Pennsylvania backwoods are either clad in Wal-Mart blue jeans and chequered shirts or in patrol officer's uniforms. The child and animal actors are good though the child actors also suffer from the poor lines given them, fortunately not the lot of the dogs who only have to bark and snarl at the right moment or the flocks of bird extras who whirl and twirl around when presumably disturbed by the alien presence. The movie might have been partially salvaged by an element of humour, but even that is missing.",Signs
443,DrLex,Beware: major pitfall ahead!,6,9 September 2006,"Minor spoilers below. But you probably read through 20 spoiler comments anyway to reach this one.It's surprising that the highest rated comments on this movie are all ""hated it"" comments. Or maybe it's not that surprising after all. As you can see, all these comments tell the same thing (which makes me wonder why even the 10th one is still rated 'useful'). The conclusion: ""this is a very bad sci-fi movie about incredibly stupid aliens (and a stupid dog too).""They're right, as a sci-fi movie this is not quite it. The plot holes are bigger than the crop circles. However, all these people are somehow missing the point, but they can't be blamed. Why is this? Well, the problem with this movie is that from the time it was announced on, people thought it would be a sci-fi movie revolving about an alien invasion and nothing else. It isn't, but this is never obvious enough.Some reviewers get it right: this movie is actually about belief. The alien story is just a vehicle. This is why everyone expecting an alien movie will be heavily disappointed at the end. It's a typical Shyamalan film in that it tries to set you on the wrong track, but it's atypical in that it's poorly executed.I think Shyamalan's biggest mistake was to eventually resort to showing more of the aliens than just some shadows and indirect hints, or even making it so obvious that there were aliens after all, and what their intentions were. There's no better way to ruin a whole suspenseful build-up based on concealment, than to show the evil in all its CGI glory and having a TV set telling what its plans are. The fact that at some point in this movie an alien is shown in its entirety, has helped to feed the misunderstanding that it's just a bad alien movie. For the conclusion of the story as it is, showing the alien was almost inevitable. But the same kind of story could have been told without having to lift the veil of mystery around the aliens. All the gigantic plot holes that so many people have fallen into, would have been avoided if we never knew what -- and who -- exactly was behind those crop circles. People could have made up their own explanations, and as everyone knows, in the absence of ready-made (CGI) answers, people come up with much more captivating ideas on their own. People would have left the theater, still wondering about the mysteries. But instead, we are spoon-fed with a pretty weak sci-fi story which at some point made me remember the movie ""Independence Day"". That's IMHO not a bad movie, but this one being associated with it, is.My conclusion: the first part is really good. The build-up of suspense works well and there are some truly scary moments. But soon, the first holes in this build-up begin to appear, and eventually it all crumbles. The finale is embarrassing.Considering Shyamalan's track record, it probably was intentional to make people believe they're watching an alien movie, and then shatter this belief and reveal the true identity of the movie. But the belief is never shattered because it _is_ an alien movie after all, and not a good one at that. All that remains, is disbelief why it was such a bad alien movie, and the actual point of the story is forgotten. Compared to the rest of the movie, the parts about the actual story even seem (pun intended)... alien.",Signs

How else can you imagine that when you are attacked by an alien, pissing at it can save your soul!

Why is a random book on aliens taken by all involved to be gospel truth? Maybe the aliens are merely observing us.  This would eliminate questions about why they don't break down doors, or why they come to Earth despite the abundance of water.* Is the writer/director making a thematic statement by casting himself as the driver who kills Mel's wife?  Creator as destroyer, perhaps?* Was all of this the ultimate divine hoax, intended to help Mel regain his faith?The two child actors give incredibly realistic and natural performances.

446,Don Muvo,"Weak Sci-fi/horror, yet speculative",6,12 January 2003,"There's a lot to like and dislike in this film. First, the film is not really as scary as Knight Shyamalan, its writer and director, and the studio implies. As science fiction, it is pure schlock. There is a message that the movie tries to deliver however, so I will pay the movie (7.5 user rating!) it's due, even though I didn't really like it. The rest of this review is pretty much a spoiler, so don't bother reading it until you've seen the film. If you have seen the film, and feel dissatisfied, perhaps you will agree with some of my points. I'll discuss some of the negatives, some positives, and what I think the filmmaker was trying to do and why it is pleasing to so many despite its faults.The fear factor: No scene is really scary. Part of the problem is the poor character development which may be attributed to the actors: Gibson, especially, is horrible by Hollywood standards, seemingly just ""going along"" and overacting for the director so that the studio can get it's money out. The performances by the children are also way below the standard here. Clearly Shyamalan is not a ""people person"", he is not getting the best out of his actors. Another problem is that Shyamalan is a trying to work within a minimalist horror ethic that really doesn't work cinematically. Minimalist concepts are important in film, it's just that a lot of the techniques that the director tries to bring off, just end up being annoying: The knocking all over the house for example to tell us that aliens are there, as well as the test pattern on the TV, which frankly just went over my head the first time I saw it. (Shyamalan wants us to interpret it as ""destruction"" of our media resources by the alien attack.) Further, the still shots on TV and alien in the alley, presented to convince the characters and the viewers that there is a world wide attack going on, are pretty lame. It seems that Shyamalan is hell-bent (my expression :) on not spending ""too much"" money on effects and wants to ""show what can be done"" with just a few resources and one damn :) expensive actor. He doesn't succeed very well, and any illusion that he has should be exposed. There is one reservation I have to make, however, it is that Shyamalan sincerely trying to draw a picture of hysteria-based reality. He is stating here that reality is NOT a fixed entity based on some objective ""out there"", but is based on culture, which of course, includes media such as film, television and books, as well as social interaction. He is quite successful in making this allusion and this contributes to the existentialist interpretation of the movie's message, as well as to the likelihood that the movie is going to make it onto some lists despite all of its roughness. 
The script: That Shyamalan is not an especially good writer of dialog seems obvious from listening carefully to what these people are saying to each other: how they often answer different questions to those asked, and speak disjointedly in general. If he feels this has a positive dramatic effect, then this brings into question what is drama, and how it works. At any rate, if this was his intention - to create a disjointedness feeling in the film viewer based on the disjointedness of the dialog - I don't think it was artistically or elegantly done, once again - it was mostly annoying. I kept asking myself, ""Would these people all watch this and want to suspend their belief if Mel Gibson were not in it?"" The feature videos on the DVD indicated that Shyamalan is a meticulous story-boarder. This may be his main talent, not bringing his own somewhat naive ideas to the screen in a minimalist style.The aliens: Not much to comment on here. They sound a lot like raccoons, have the classic skinny look almost to the point of effeminacy (but not so much that a man can't fit into the costume) and yet, look a bit like Spiderman. (Was it a left-over pattern from wardrobe?) Water kills them, which seems to imply that they come from a part of the universe where ordinary properties of matter don't apply. Oh yes, and they have poison gas jet in their wrist, which they use to kill humans one at a time. Hmm, this echoes back to Spiderman, doesn't it? And even though there are many of them in their flying saucers and a gang of them pounding on the house, there are only two in the movie, one in the house and one running though a back-alley in Brazil (probably the same actor). Believe me, E.T. was a lot better.The story: Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) was a priest who lost his belief when his wife, Colleen, died because of a careless driver (the sixth character, Ray, played by Shyamalan). Gibson's character is actually the strongest element of the film and clearly calls for an actor of his stature. Also, the portrayal of Colleen's death becomes a central element in the apotheosis of the movie, as Graham Hess gradually comes to realize that her final words were inspirational instructions to him on how to conduct himself and the family through their time of need (the alien invasion). This makes some sense on at least two levels: 1) That Graham was to recover his religious belief as a result of surviving this test and abandoning his angry disbelief; and 2) existentially and metaphorically, as the character says, ""Everything happens for a reason"", therefore the wife dies, she gives advice, the advice is followed and the family survives the alien invasion. Viewers may respond then to this according to their own personal degree of religiosity: the more religious will tend to see it as a reconversion story, echoing their own reconversions. The non-religious can weigh the existentialist message, ""Everything happens for a reason"", and reflect on whether their own experience bares this out and perhaps, whether or not it should. This is a positive message and a coherent statement by Shyamalan, which will not play as well in Peoria (Christian fundamentalists may consider this as too mixed a message, while they should ""thank God for small favors"" in that Shyamalan puts religious belief in so positive a light. Only the skeptical empiricists will be left completely out in the cold. Oh well, you can't always please everyone, right?In summary, I think that Shyamalan has made a movie that will be often discussed and will always have to be judged on its own merits, which is probably as it should be. The film is important in that it deals in speculative matters of human knowledge (not the existence of alien beings), rare in American Cinema.",Signs
447,E-Z-Rider,A major disappointment,3,3 August 2002,"I am a fan of Mel Gibson's pretty much since Road Warrior, and I loved Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, so went to see Signs with every expectation of really liking it. It's been a long time since I've been so disappointed in a movie. The story, if you can call it such, moves at the speed of molasses; the director uses every cheap trick of lighting, photography, camera angle and timing to create a tension that really doesn't exit; the movie is full of clichés, platitudes and just plain silliness; almost everything on the screen is stolen from some other movie--Night of the Living Dead, Children of the Corn, Close Encounters--the list goes on; the plot has more holes than Swiss cheese and in the end you feel cheated by all the contrived sentimentality. Mel Gibson is so inert he almost implodes; Joaquin Phoenix is a joke; the two children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) fall all over themselves and each other as to which one can be the most precious or the most profound. So much bad acting from what are some pretty good actors must be the fault of the director who obviously wanted to create something with deep meaning but succeeded only in boring me and my wife and sons to tears.***SPOILER***Of all the evasions and implausibilities in the movie, the one that kept bugging us as we discussed it while driving home from the theater is this one: If water has the same effect on the bodies of the aliens that, say, sulfuric acid has on humans, why would they invade a planet that is mostly made up of water and do so in the buff? Couldn't they stop at Wall Mart first and pick up wet suits and umbrellas?",Signs

450,seltzer,Great intimate science fiction,10,20 January 2003,"I thought this movie was great.  I've never seen such a film that looks at global events entirely through the eyes of a single family.  You really get a better sense of just how afraid someone can be when their world turns upside down, and in the case of the Hess family, the main characters, it turns upside down again.  As with all of Mr. Shyamalan's movies, you end up realizing that you've been watching a different movie than what you thought you were watching when the end arrives, and he always pulls it off with great skill and a different twist.  The man clearly loves to tell a good story, and Signs is as good a movie as they make with a great story.  The performances are spectacular, even from the kids, and the effects are simple and understated, but they pay off.  I won't provide any spoilers here, but the film deals with the possibility of alien invasion and takes off from there into philosophy and faith and a whole bunch of other stuff.  A great movie, maybe even the exact opposite of films like Armageddon.",Signs
451,aleator,What a turkey!,2,19 September 2002,"Watching this movie in expectation but with growing alarm, it was hard to believe it was made by the same director of 'The Sixth Sense'. What on earth was he thinking of? In 'Signs' we have every modern film cliche thrown in - the asthmatic child, the dysfunctional family, the husband tortured by his wife's death in a car accident on which he keeps having flashbacks.The sci-fi element was just ridiculous and laughable. Are we to believe aliens had the technology to travel millions of light years to Earth but yet couldn't get past a pantry door? The final scenes were so stupid (and yet so predictable) I almost gasped in disbelief. I rate this the most disappointing movie since 'Blair Witch' conned everyone a few years back.",Signs

Then must the mind of man find itself in that troublesome predicament where it ever knows less than it can believe. This supernatural thriller intricately weaves a well-crafted story about one man's journey of faith as he deals with the uncertainties of life and the vicissitudes of existence. And what I personally found to be a refreshing change from other flicks I have seen that have dealt with a similar theme is that this movie is just as entertaining as it is enlightening. It shines a bright flashlight upon the inner roller coaster of faith and yet gently illuminates in a subtle way that I found to be neither preachy or condescending. I also enjoyed the light-hearted moments in this movie well executed by a superb cast of talented actors portraying likable characters blending in just enough humor to balance out some of the more seriously intense scenes of dramatic tension. All in all, there were signs that this was going to be a really good movie from the beginning to the end and I believed them even before I knew for certain.",Signs
453,cosmicfish14,A Bit Of A Departure,4,26 August 2015,"Now we get to Shyamalan's third film, ""Signs"". This is also where I feel his movies started to decline. But we will get to why in this review.Now something I should mention is that I don't think this is a terrible movie, but I wouldn't consider it good. But there are a good amount of people who do like this movie, but this is my opinion.One thing I should mention is that a lot of the acting is very robotic, not as robotic as Shyamalan's later films but still noticeable. Also there are the child characters who act like adults and some of the adult characters act like kids. Also Shyamalan does the Hitchcock-Tarantino thing where he casts himself as a character in the movie. But here's the thing, with Hitchcock he cast himself as a background character, not an important character, and Tarantino can actually act. Which is important when you are making yourself a somewhat major character. So yeah, Shyamalan isn't a very good actor, which is made more clear by his next movie.Also now we have a slower paced movie now then the last one, which would be fine if it wasn't so boring. That's kinda the major problem with this movie is that it isn't very interesting, not even the aliens are all that interesting. There is also some attempted suspense but that also fails, but there are some good moments though. Sorry if I don't have much to say about this movie, its just a bunch of boring stuff that happens and that's it.And for those wondering why I didn't talk about the ending, I would recommend you watch this analysis of the movie that talks about the ending. Even though I don't agree with his opinion about the movie, he does give a good point about the endinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ju05PuiyQ",Signs
454,mercybell,"Goosebumps abound!: Skillful, crafty, sly, scary... but ultimately a beautiful film",10,12 January 2003,"Every year there is a point where I (mentally, at least) give up on mainstream American cinema and relegate myself to enjoying classics or smaller budget, obscure, foreign, or indie films. Imagine my surprise when I found myself hooked to the first 3 minutes of this film, and then enjoying it.Back to the film. The film is scary, it's very scary, and it delights in the stuff that scares people and little kids on a day to day basis: reflections, sounds, music, intense paranoia (paranoia is a very big factor in this film). But believe me, the threat of alien invasion is hardly what this film is about. Many scary films these days rely totally on their scare factor, this film made the wise decision not to. It uses what is scary in the film as a tool to hammer in a bigger point about faith and trust and family.
Where that may sound as though it's delving into the awfully sappy world of Hallmark Hall of Fame, it's not. The film rather reminded me of The Twilight Zone (though, strangely, Shyamalan does not list that series as a basis or inspiration in the documentary). The film centers around the Hess family who suffered a devastating blow after a rather gruesome tragedy. The portrayal of grief and death and everyone's estrangement is cold and sharp, there's nothing sweet about this movie. The tone of the film has a deadpan humor to it. Everything is stricken and old looking (Graham Hess, Gibson's character, is a preacher, and a lot of his Victorian country farmhouse looks like it's full of hand me downs), except for the muted and lush visuals of the gorgeous countryside. The music (especially at the beginning, which in a theatre was loud and shocking), is deliciously creepy and chilling yet at the same time works for dramatic purposes, kudos to James Newton Howard for such a skillfull piece of work. Tak fujimoto's cinematography milks the fear, bleakness, and sarcasm from the air by the gallons. Bravo! Finally, the fears of the family about the strange occurrences, and their desperation when the super sci-fi situation seemingly gets out of hand, feels very, very real, and keeps you juggling, just like the characters, for a good while as to what is real and what isn't.The actors are the same. They're honest and blunt with their styles. They all gel their performances and characters together to create a world onscreen that becomes realistic, they are realistic. It's a horror movie, it has to be believable. The characters are flawed, with idiosyncrasies, they aren't perfect specimens,  they all have something that's wrong with them, physically, mentally, spiritually, they are human after all, yet we still accept them. This really fleshes the movie out and makes it more believable and them more endearing, and ultimately, rewarding. For example: the devestated Graham Hess' interaction with his children is often listless, he worries about them, but often can't express his feelings, so they tend to turn to their uncle for any solace (wonderfully played by Joaquin Phoenix in a rare role for him as the normal, suave, and slightly comedic Merrill Hess, a man who embarrassingly failed at minor league baseball). Cherry Jones turns up in a wonderfully played supporting role as a local police officer and friend of the family's. It's not often that you see someone get  so much out of a limited supporting role and give so much back to the benefit of the film as Ms. Jones does with her role. And you remember her character and performance. Kudos to her.This film is unpretentious and sly. Everything about this film works towards the goal, in the end everything fits like a jigsaw puzzle, I can't say much lest I give away any vital plot points, but let me say that it makes you believe it's all about one aspect of the movie, then hits you with a larger theme and message, but you're so wrapped up with the scary part, you forget about the latter. The ""big twist"" is not supernatural but human. The ending is one of the more ingenious and truly beautiful endings I have seen in years.Like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, this film craftfully weaves drama with horror. Where I found the other two films applaudable and superbly crafted, I found ""Signs"" was truly endearing to me. There's something about how it gives you goosebumps during the frightening parts, yet also the human ""drama"" parts that was different from many a film I've seen. I rarely get goosebumps watching people interacting with each other, most of the time films can be so banal, pretentious, and cliched, human drama loses all effect, but not here. And ultimately, when the scare factor rubs off, the film retains it's rewatchability. It's a fun entertaining movie that was perfect as a summertime hit, yet it's also a stunning, stirring film that wasn't afraid to use unconventional means to get a higher, more profound, message across.",Signs
455,MySilentReverie,"Funny, Amazing, and Incredible",10,2 August 2002,"I went to see Signs today and I must say that I absolutely loved it.  I think that it is another great movie by M. Night Shyamalan and in my eyes he can't do anything wrong.  He is such a great writer and director.  To my surprise, this movie was more funny than anything.  Joaquin Phoenix was hilarious as were the two little kids and Mel Gibson did another great performance and reminded me why I like his acting so much.  There were a few more surprises for me too.  I thought that there would be a lot more aliens than there were but surprisingly there were very few (which is alright with me).  Also the trailer portrayed the movie to be more sci-fi than anything but really the movie is not sci-fi at all.  If you like M. Night Shyamalan films I think that you will like this film.  If you just want to go see a sci-fi movie about aliens you won't like this film at all.  This story is more about the personal faith that people have and what it takes to gain it back after you have lost it.  Out of a possible 10 I would give this movie a 20.  I absolutely thought that it is possibly the best movie of the summer. It has some substance unlike most of the movies out right now.  I can't wait until M. Night Shyamalan's next movie comes out.....he is a genius in my eyes and I'm so glad there is a director in Hollywood like him.",Signs

457,Jenny Ho,M Night Shyamalan fans will not be disappointed (except perhaps by the ending),8,21 September 2002,"Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, a man who lives on a farm with his two young children and brother (Joaquin Phoenix).  One day, the news headlines on television reveal that large crop circles have appeared around the world (one of these has appeared right outside the Hess' house!)  The world speculates that there are only two possible explanations: either it is a hoax or signs of an alien invasion.  We also find out that Graham Hess was previously a priest but lost faith when his wife died.  The events in the film cause him to embark on a voyage of discovery which helps him regain his faith by the end.Having been a fan of M Night Shyamalan's two previous films The Sixth Sense' and Unbreakable', I was eager to check out his latest offering. This director has a very distinctive style which is again apparent in Signs': he uses strong child actors; takes time in the story-telling; focuses on only a small number of characters and there is a flashback sequence in the final reel.  Part of the fun of his films is also looking out for the director's cameo appearance!  It is a style which I find very effective but I do know some people who have found the build-up to his stories too slow and uninteresting.The two male leads give engaging and subtle performances.  The child actors are also good; they are never irritating and very believable this comes as a surprise considering the son is played by one of the Culkin brothers! I found the story both suspenseful and engrossing.  It is also quite a scary film in places going for suggestion of what cannot be seen in the shadows rather than in-your-face' scares.  All the audience gets for most of the film is strange noises on an old baby monitor and glimpses in reflections on a kitchen knife and the television set.  There is a sense of the family being in real isolation with their link to the outside world being provided only really by news updates on television while outside there is an unexplained presence which is made more threatening by a picture of a house in flames in the son's extra-terrestrial textbook which looks eerily like the Ness' home.The only let-down in the film is perhaps the ending which gave me the sense that the director couldn't be bothered with anything fancy this time round. Without giving too much away I can only describe the ending as being too convenient.",Signs

God did this to HIM therefore his faith has wavered, children being murdered in Nazi death camps is absolutely fine.

462,erose001,It's Not What You Think It Is,9,13 July 2003,"After reading the mixed reviews and hearing comments from family and friends about this movie, I decided to save my money, and see the movie on whichever premium movie channel bought first rights.  After all, it's hard for a director to top a movie like Shyamalan's *The Sixth Sense*, and I hate being disappointed in a movie I paid extra money to see. But I think those folk were expecting either a horror movie or an apocolyptic movie (neither of which interest me in any event), and were disappointed.  Too bad for them.  All the better for me, because I went into this without any expectations.And having a lack of expectations can pay off in amazing ways.  First, for me, as a lover of deeply textured suspense films, such as Hitchcock's, it is pure delight to see a director make such playful reference to some of the great suspense films, as well as a few of the so-bad-they've-become-myth types (there's even a rather amusing moment of *Blair Witch* thrown in). And all the while unravelling a fascinating symbolic portrait of a man coming to terms with his faith and his grief.And make no mistake, this movie is an unravelling.  It is not one of those movies that ties everything up in a neat little bow.  You actually are left wanting more, but in a good way, like after reading a good novel that gets your imagination fired up about what might've happened next to each character.  What you do get will keep you talking with your movie-loving friends for years to come.  Some of the reviewers will try to tell you that it falls back on pop spirituality, but I think in 25 years, those reviewers will find themselves feeling pretty silly.  As a very spiritual person, I was moved profoundly by the movie's spirituality.  (I venture that any of the reviewers who panned the movie - Village Voice take note - will find themselves feeling pretty silly in 25 years.)What these unenlightened reviewers are confusing for pop spirituality is actually fundamental spirituality, that of the home as the symbol of the psyche.  And Shyamalan is proving deft at using homes to such strong psychological effect.  That is a trait this movie shares with *The Sixth Sense*, both of which take place throughout the physical and psychic home. And, in my opinion, all the great suspense thrillers ultimately involved the home as the symbol of the psyche, from Hitch to Romero to Stephen King.  A more recent (and well-done) entry to the oeuvre is *The Others*.  Even the good rip-offs had the sense to recognize this fundamental essence of human nature, hence we have *Nightmare on Elm Street* and *Poltergeist.*  But this is not another *Sixth Sense*, so don't expect that.  But who wants that anyway?  That movie rejuvenated a genre that had all but died, and in a way so clever that few will be able to ever top it.  It stands on its own. 
This movie follows in that genre very nicely, however, and, like *The Sixth Sense* will leave you quietly affected for hours or even days.  It has a few dialogue and pacing issues and at least one throw-away scene, but, on balance, it has some amazing cinematography, and from the moment you hear the opening strains of the James Newton Howard score (which is also an homage to Hitch), uses sound (or, sometimes, lack thereof) to brilliant effect.  Even its occasional comic touches are well-placed, like the comic relief in one of Shakespeare's tragedies.  And I will leave my comments there because this is not a movie one can review in a straightforward way, or in a way that would avoid spoilers.  The whole movie is potentially spoiled when too many plot points are revealed, because like a dream (or a nightmare), everyone will interpret the symbols of this story in a way that makes the most sense for them in their own lives.  That, to me, is its ultimate brilliance.Let me just say that I am inclined to agree with Roger Ebert's four-star review, which was written in a way that allows each viewer to discover the delight and/or discomfort of the movie for him or herself.",Signs

466,Momcat_of_Lomita,You have to drop the Gibson/Phoenix/Shyamalan baggage,7,3 May 2011,"It's hard to write a review of this movie now (2011), after all the attention that Mel Gibson's ugly tirades got, after Joaquin Phoenix's crazy ""mockumentary"", after M. Night Shyamalan's missing the mark with ""Lady in the Water,"" ""The Happening,"" and ""The Last Airbender."" But if you can let go of the baggage that subsequent events have loaded onto this movie, it's a decent, watchable movie. It does have some flaws, but it's well above average as entertainment and gets points for originality from all parties.So: what's it about? It takes a little while to declare itself. Initially it seems to want to be a suspense drama. And then it morphs into a sci-fi invasion drama. And then, at the end, it finally declares itself: it's about unlikely events providing a redemption for a man of faith who, for a while, lost his faith.First things first: Gibson. Up until we were inundated with recordings of his ugly tirades of venom spewed at his ex-girlfriend, and his anti-semitic tirade during his DUI arrest, Gibson was a genuinely likable actor who could project a streak of craziness that made him suspenseful to watch. There was also a sense of humor about him; at any moment in a serious drama, he might break out with a comedic moment that lightened things up. And he conveys these things in the character he plays here, but he also gets across to us that this character is a man who has lost his calling and doesn't know how to fill the empty place it left.Working with him to move the plot forward is Joaquin Phoenix as his younger brother, a man who hasn't lost anything of a calling because he hasn't found anything to hold him yet. He exists in this movie mostly as a foil for Gibson's character, and he plays that part well. He's an actor who is sexy and charismatic and has a feel of dangerousness even when you know he's solidly on the side of good things.Through a series of events surrounding an alien invasion, Gibson takes actions to protect his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (an adorable, and tiny, Abigail Breslin). As events proceed, we get flashbacks that lead us to the source of Gibson's disillusionment and loss of faith, the death of his wife in a freak car accident.This leads me somewhat obliquely to what I have to regard as this movie's biggest flaw: Shyamalan doesn't seem to have much faith in the ability of his audience to see what he's getting at. He is not subtle in getting his major premise across; he wants to spell it out, then repeat it for emphasis, and then finally beat us over the head with it to make sure that we ""get it."" This is jarring, to say the least, and it works against the movie: it's hard not to feel that maybe if he feels the need to be obvious, BLATANTLY obvious, perhaps he's unsure of himself and his craft as a writer and a director. He doesn't want the material to fail: but I think that if he wants to craft movies that are more than workmanlike entertainment, he has to take chances in trusting the audience and trusting himself and his ability to get things across to the audience without spelling them out so obviously.He doesn't want to take that chance, and that shows. And it hurts the movie.I kind of think that it affected Gibson and Phoenix, too. There are some moments in the film when it seems like they're just going through the motions, just ""reading"" their lines, not living them and making them live. Gibson does this more than Phoenix does, and it makes me wonder: was Shyamalan afraid to call him on this and demand better from him? It's obvious to the whole world now that Gibson has quite an ego, and with his experience both in front of and behind the camera, he must be an intimidating presence to direct. Was he holding back and just going through the motions because he didn't like some of the material? Was Shyamalan unaware of how Gibson came across, or was he afraid to demand better? I don't know and it doesn't matter. Those moments when Gibson is obviously not engaged in the material are jarring.In the end, I want to recommend this film with some reservations. It's decent entertainment and has originality. It also has flaws that hold it back.But I think the bottom line in deciding whether you want to watch this film or not is whether you can disengage what you know about Gibson, Phoenix and Shymalan off the set from what's happening on the screen. If you bring their baggage to this movie, I don't think you will enjoy it at all.",Signs
467,ptwomey,The Alien Invasion film is back!,8,4 September 2002,"A film with M. Night Shyamalan as writer/director is becoming more of something to look out for. His unique style or emotional story telling places a fresh spin on the Hollywood formula films and Signs is no exception. Just like Unbreakable, which was basically a super-hero film that look nothing like a super-hero film, Signs is a war of the worlds film that looks nothing like a war of the world film. Loosely labelled a Horror movie, Signs is about a small family living on a farm that finds a crop circle in their fields. Soon after a series of events occur that changes their lives forever.Father Graham Hess played superbly by Mel Gibson has lost his faith in God and removed himself from the church. He lives with his brother Merrill Hess, played by Joaquin Phoenix and his two children Morgan and Bo Hess, played by Rory Culkin and Abigaul Breslin respectively. The four form a unique emotional connection that centres on the tragic death of Graham's wife, which is the cause of most of the drama in the film. The course of the plot is basically Graham's journey back to faith and the belief that miracles are more than coincidence, that someone is out there helping us.The film is also a return to the traditional edge of your seat suspense formula. You are constantly searching for answers and at time the painfully constructed tension is too much to bear. The entire film concentrates on the vulnerability of the key characters and their sometimes very close encounters. It also never forgets to humour you along the way, and the comic relief is both very funny and well constructed. In terms of rewarding you for purchasing the ticket, this film gets top marks. Whilst all this dramatic story telling takes place, the rest of the wider world is experiencing events that equate to an alien invasion, nothing short of the original War of the Worlds, and in many ways very similar to The Day of the Triffids. One could be excused for becoming frustrated that the wider story is not being told, but that is not the point of the film and it may also be the reason critics have received the film with a mixed response. The film did enough to my mind with respects to the wider world without losing focus on the four characters and their story at home. The film is basically a domino effect, where several dominoes are established in the course of the film and they all fall over in one key moment at the end. Some found this emotional and symbolic domino effect resolution somewhat unsatisfying, but I would certainly disagree.The film is not without flaw however, at some key moments the tension is interrupted by a lack of both physical and dramatic action. Some of the special effects towards the end of the film are questionable and you perhaps see a little too much of Shyamalan's not so little green men. Perhaps most of the film's flaws can be attributed to the fact that this is Shyamalan's first alien film.Overall however the film is a rewarding and entertaining experience, it can frustrate those who prefer an Independence Day style production but at the end of the day that is not what the film is about. If only more films could display the level of intelligence and maturity of this film. Still it has received mixed responses and chances are you will either love it or hate it, I for one love it and will probably go and see it again.",Signs

469,DTL,Worst Movie of the Year,1,23 September 2002,I went to see SIGNS on the urgings of two colleagues. In a word the film is dreadful. I haven't been so bored by anything since I gave another two hours of my life up at VANILLA SKY last year.  The first act had me scratching my head trying to follow the plot. In the second act I was battling following asleep.  By the third act I smiled a lot because the film then seemed a bit clever the way it wrapped itself up.  I say a bitdefinitely not enough to save this turkey.  It will surely be top of my TEN WORST LIST for this year. A MUST MISS.,Signs
470,deproduction,Didn't like the message or the style,6,5 August 2002,"The lone highlight of this film was the one spot I expected to deliver the least: Mel Gibson.  Though nearly every character was fairly superficial and flat, Gibson's Graham Hess was well-developed, deep, engaging and likeable, despite the writer's lame attempts at trite humor. The rest of the film seemed to remain on the surface, with poor acting and worse character-development in most of the supporting roles, especially Officer Paski. Most of all, I was turned-off by the over-riding message of the film.  I have never been a fan of those who subscribe to the ideology that there are no coincidences.  There are countless millions of opportunities for wild coincidences every second, and to believe that when you are lucky, it is because God planned it that way, and when others are unlucky, it is, likewise, supposed to be that way.  God simply does not wish to protect them? If God wanted to protect this family, he could've done it simply by having the aliens land in another field, as opposed to setting up this elaborate scheme of endless coincidences that contributed to their survival. At least he Shyamalan has a message, which is more than I can say for 99% of the film-makers out there today.  Still, his sense of humor and sense of emotion have never succeeded in drawing me in.",Signs

An excellent execution of story and tension using the well known crop signs that have in reality appeared in many parts of the world, Shyamalan spins a story of incredible power.  Mel Gibson playing the part of a minister who loses his faith after the horrific death of his wife and Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of his younger brother were powerful characters of the movie.  This is war of the worlds taken to a higher level that only M. Night Shyamalan can take it.Congradulations Mr. Shyamalan on a very excellently executed film.",Signs

The aliens are, well, the same aliens we saw a million times before - nothing original.M. Night Shyamalan has failed us again.

""Hmm, we are allergic to water, so lets invade a planet covered by the substance, in dew-covered fields, and kidnap people who are made primarily of the stuff! Yeah, and lets not wear any protective gear at all! Brilliant plan! Oh no, they turned on the sprinklers! Retreat, retreat!"" But since that apparently wasn't the real focus of the story (they only devoted about 90% of the movie building up that aspect, after all) The real story is about how a reverend deals with the invasion and gets his superficial faith back because of all the stupid coincidences helped him save his family, or something. It's not that the aliens border on being retarded, it must have been a higher power, yeah, that's the ticket.",Signs
475,spinin,(THE SIXTH SENSE + UNBREAKABLE)/2 = SIGNS,8,13 December 2002,"SIGNS is yet another strong movie from M. Night Shyamalan that follows the formulas he has presented in THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. This time a Pennsylvania farmhouse provides the setting and a widowed reverend (Mel Gibson), his two kids (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin), and his less conservative brother (Joaquin Phoenix) are the main characters. The ordinary people find themselves in extraordinary circumstances after some crop circles appear in their fields. Strange occurrences follow and numerous contradictory speculations within the family are inevitable. Soon the situation turns far more serious with an appearance of several UFOs around the world, including near the family's house. Are these really aliens and are they friendly or hostile?Like the other two Shyamalan films, SIGNS becomes a character study. We learn of the preacher's struggle with his faith and Phoenix's character becomes a tough guy gone scared. Both men reveal important elements from their past as the movie progresses and they become fully developed characters rather than horror film victims running around screaming. The two kids embrace the arrival of the aliens in a hopeful and innocently childlike way. The acting by all is very good and the kids are an improvement over the boy from UNBREAKABLE. The story unfolds patiently and builds up in suspense. Shyamalan again shows great control over pacing. He combines Spielberg's early sci-fi storytelling techniques with Hitchcock-like direction, understanding that less is more. SIGNS utilizes the sound of the wind, the movement in the fields, the distant dog barks, the creepy shadows, the eerie music, and the characters' scared reactions all at once effortlessly. The cinematography, lighting, and use of color are all superb again like in the previous two Shyamalan films. As I was watching the movie I realized how much I was enjoying everything that was up on the screen. I could see the effort and the careful attention to detail. This is no INDEPENDENCE DAY or GODZILLA as there is no numbing explosions and corny dialogue. With SIGNS you get a true build up of suspense and uncertainty before Shyamalan wraps it all up in his typically exciting fashion.I do have one problem with the film. It is a major problem and a minor one at the same time. The entire film is constructed in such a familiar fashion that some of the surprises and developments feel a little predictable. The following can all be found in THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE, and SIGNS: the immature (ghosts, super heroes, and now aliens) story directed in a very mature manner, similar uses of color and shadow, similar pacing and character development, similar relationships between adults and kids (the kids usually guide the less open minded adults toward the correct state of mind), the sub-par appearance of the director, the really toned down acting (no real objection here, but one scream once in a may actually be a little more realistic), the Pennsylvania settings, and the big revelations in the climax (small one in SIGNS). I know that some of those are trivial. More can probably be found, but that is not important. What I am trying to say is that I am disappointed that Shyamalan has not grown much as a director since THE SIXTH SENSE. All the things I have listed above are positives (except for Shyamalan's cameos), but I'm not being surprised by anything new. The stories are all different, but the framework is just the same. I still did not see some of the ideas or twists coming during SIGNS, but I was expecting them to show up. I wasn't too shocked to see them appear like clockwork. Everything felt so calculated. I liked UNBREAKABLE the most and now I find SIGNS to be the weakest of the three. If SIGNS came out before the other two movies and UNBREAKABLE were released third, possibly I would have found UNBREAKABLE to be the weakest. And maybe SIGNS would have taken the country by storm the way THE SIXTH SENSE did if it were released earlier. I don't know. As long as Shyamalan will follow these structures, he will not grow as a director. On the other hand, if he continues to follow these formulas in all of his films then probably every single one of them will be good. I'm already waiting with curiosity for his next one. For now, SIGNS gets an 8 out of 10.",Signs

The director will just keep on making films, good or bad, because he's been on that track ever since the day his rich parents provided him with the means to be filmmaker.  Mel Gibson will go on being whatever kind of actor he's supposed to be and that's not very clear from what I saw in this film.

479,jryan-4,Signs say Box Office Ahead,8,5 August 2002,"Somewhere within Signs I picked up the scent of contempt for theAmerican film goer. The director seems so self -assured in hisdesire to tap into the hearts of the viewing public, which translates,of course into splendiferous box office returns, that he creates a bitof a camel. I admit, i am a huge fan of Field of Dreams and Night of the LivingDead as for that matter War of the Worlds, Creature from the BlackLagoon, Independence Day, Close Encounters of the Third Kindand all other other cinematic ingredients that went into the mix,(homage, ripoff )of this particular cinematic camel soup. I liked allof those movies better. They struck me as more honest.About the best compliment i can come up with for Signs is that itserves as the post 9/11 version of Field of Dreams. In the lateeighties a spirit of hope, perhaps false resonated within thecountry. In 2002 a feeling of anxiety lingers. Who knows the nexttime that we will all become transfixed in national communionupon our teevee screens like we were 9/11,like the characters inSigns are transfixed by their teevees throughout the film.Certainly, the hypnotic power of televised catastrophe is a primetime concept in Signs.The major theme of course is redemption and faith. I have noproblem with either of those concepts, if I did I wouldn't becompulsively listening to the new Springsteen CD, the Rising.For the second straight movie (We Were Soldiers Once being thefirst), I was distracted by the cumbersome, nearly lurchingperformance of Mel Gibson. Every time I looked at Mel in Signs, Igot the feeling that Mel was very aware  of the camera looking athim and ""acting"" for that camera. That's always a bad sign.Early box office returns seem to indicate that Night was right. Thepublic apparently is buying Signs. I did mainly because of myadmiration for the Sixth Sense as well as my interest in cropcircles, cattle disembowelments and black helicopters etc.I have the feeling that the next camel that Night creates will be lessvalid and authentic than Signs which is clearly less valid andauthentic than Sixth Sense. I'm also afraid that as the director'sartistic integrity dwindles his commercial success will continue tosoar which is truly a dreadful sign of the times",Signs

If I understand the story, the entire earth has to suffer an alien invasion so Mel can get his faith in his god back. And what Old Testament god it is. This god afflicts a young boy with severe asthma, makes his little sister neurotic about water and kills Mel's wife just so remaining family members can survive an attack by an single alien with no clear idea what it is trying to accomplish. Too bad this god was unable to, like, make these aliens, who can be killed by a glass of water, smart enough to realize that it might not be a good idea to attempt a take-over of a planet (and a people) who are made of predominantly just that: water. Clearly, Mel's god is not omniscient. More like a plot-convince deity. Of course, a movie is more than just story (even this one)... the set decoration here was, for me, the best part of the picture. All those glasses of water, for example. Someone put a lot of thought into coming up with a bunch of different tumblers just like a family would collect over the years and a kid might use.",Signs
482,heathentart,It's not anything to do with aliens...,9,25 March 2006,"and everything to do with belief and fear.M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. He can write, direct and guide a film better than anyone living or dead. While Steven Spielberg is his equal as director, he cannot write as well.This film is so perfect, so finely-tuned, crafted and sewn together, it will accompany you around for days to come.It doesn't matter the theme is ""aliens invading Earth,"" as that has nothing to do with the film. It could have been ""KKK burning a black family's home"" or ""Nazis killing Jews."" This film, in its entirety, is about the experience of being human. That it's juxtaposed against aliens just makes it more interesting. Two disparate species who want the same thing: to survive.What makes this film so important is the dialogue. The script is tight, each weft and warp - each thread - pulled tightly into the weave of the whole. Each word is polished and trenchant. There is not a single wasted or unnecessary sentence. Even the unexpected humor belonged right *there*. For that, Shamalayan deserved recognition. I have no idea why ""Signs"" wasn't nominated for any of the Oscars. Three of the five nominated films bored me silly, while ""Signs"" kept me riveted in my seat. If that's not the mark of a great film, then I don't understand the medium.Brilliant director, brilliant screenplay and film and brilliant cast. Mel Gibson has had a 50/50 success rate with his roles, but this one of a man struggling with the destruction of his faith, is on the uptick side of his performances.Joaquin Phoenix is riveting, absolutely riveting, as a lost man clinging to the broken shards of a past neither brilliant nor terrible, but somewhere in a destructive in-between.The children are eerily un-childlike, yet as vulnerable and tender as only children can be. How Shyamalan wrung such performances out of Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, I've no idea, but I was mesmerized.I hope the members of AMPAS wake up and realize what a treasure we have in M. Night Shyamalan. I don't want to see - 30 years hence - a ""lifetime achievement award"" for a man overlooked during his distinguished career.Last comment: Shyalmalan's performance as Ray Reddy was superb. He was important, yet unobtrusive, in the life of the script. That all actors can be so powerful and yet restrained.

I was impressed by SIXTH SENSE.  But I think he's gone downhill since then.Somehow, the invasion of the world is defeated.  But not ours to know who or why--or how.  But oh yeah, there's one alien left behind.  And in keeping with the writing, the aliens are like those that a fifth-grader would draw.And as if we needed any more schmaltz, there's some guff about religious faith.

When it was revealed that Merrill set the home run distance record in the minor leagues and ""still has the bat at home"", it was OBVIOUS that this bat would be used as a weapon later on in the film.The dialogue wasn't realistic, it was contrived.  The tension was contrived. Why are these aliens fighting with their bare hands?  If they are so afraid of water, why don't they wear a water-proof outfit?  Duh.

It's not like he's Spielburg. The Sixth Sense was a great film, but he simply doesn't have the credit to be trying to use his name to throw up on every film in order to express how good it is.  Since the Sixth Sense his films have been progressively getting worse.  ""Unbreakable"" was decent, but nowhere near as intelligent as his first film.  And casting himself in the movie, albeit in a small part, was a mistake.  He's acting like he's Hitchcock all of a sudden.  Signs was entertaining, but not something I would have enjoyed in the theater, and not something I'd be interested in seeing again.  The plot was a bit broken up, and you couldn't really understand the central theme.  Was this a film about a man who loses his faith, or aliens taking over the world?  I was looking forward to this film because of the director, and because of my fascination with crop circles, which didn't really have much to do with the actual movie.  I suppose it's a decent film if you're bored and want to rent it one night, but don't expect any of the great plot twists like you see in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.

486,dublin9,Terrible rip-off of War of The Worlds for the politically correct,1,10 August 2002,"My wife and I love science fiction movies.  We are such fanatics that we bend over backwards to find something nice in even poor examples of the genre.  So today, in spite of some really bad reviews, we trecked over to our neighborhood theatre to take in the first show.While I am a Brooklyn New York kid, my wife is the first off an American farm since 1710.  This is important, because the director obviously has no knowledge whatever about farm life, even in an upscale area like Bucks County, Pa.Essentially, this badly done rip-off of War of the Worlds takes place in a rural setting.  Our alleged hero (played by Mel Gibson) is a widower who lives with his younger jock brother (played by Joaquin Phoenix) our hero's two children and two German Shephard dogs.  They see crop circles, extraterrestrials, blah, blah, blah.With that said, everything falls apart, so much so that the audience around us laughed several times at the absurdity.  And we live in a very upscale neighborhood where males bend over backwards to display their feminine side to get dates with yuppie women.In the first place, no farmer lives in a rural area without the benefit of at least a shotgun.  And few if any farmers are vegetarians.  And there was no livestock on this large afluent farm... not even a chicken.  And farm children don't come out with remarks like ""aliens are vegetarians because their brain develops better (Sorry Mr. Shyamalan.  You may be a Hindu but there's no place in the cinema for preaching your vegin philosophy).""Even the two large German Shephard dogs are passive.  When they sense a threat, they p**s on the kitchen floor and attack the children they love so much.  Boy, whoever wrote this rot doesn't know German Shephard's very well.The only male image is a macho female police officer.  In the entire movie, she is the only armed person.  But in keeping with passive dogma, no firearm is ever drawn.Throughout the entire movie, the men elicit expressions of cows in the pasture and never come to the defense of anyone, including the children. Even without firearms (highly unlikely in a rural Pennsylvania setting), they never pick up a kitchen knife or even a broom for defense.  They just stare blankly and hug the children when threatened by aliens.  Come to think of it, they clutch the children tightly, placing them as shields.  Maybe they hoped their vegetarian children would grab a kitchen fork and defend their beleagured home.There were other ""progressive"" cliches also, but one really sticks in my mind.  A recruiting Sergeant (a Sergeant First Class to be exact) and the only soldier in the film is portreyed as a moron.  And the only person enlisting in his office looks like a retarded ax murder on the run.All in all, this film was an exercise in sucking up to every progressive special interest group.  But as for science fiction, it will go down as dull, improbable and a waste of time.This movie deserves a ""0"" rating for robbing the audience, but we had a good lunch afterwards so I'll give it a ""1"".",Signs

As a priest, we might have expected him to understand that people do die and not to throw his dummy out of the pram so readily. Presumably had the priest been Catholic he wouldn't have had a wife and there wouldn't have been a film.Anyway, Mel makes the most of things and gets the message across that bug eyed greys shouldn't mess with us because we've got the holy water.Mel puts in a typically enthusiastic performance to raise the story above the corn. There is a good blend of suspense and sentiment. Little Abigail Breslin as Bo, is used to good effect to charm us and take our minds off being unnecessarily critical of the storyline.Point to note. Do not advise that priest, carrying large kitchen knife, be used as emissary to possible future alien landing.",Signs
490,c-corleis,The weak end destroyed a lot of the movie,7,3 July 2005,"First of all, i will start with the positive aspects of ""Signs"": The film is well made, it don't need a lot of special effects to cover a weak plot or made the audience scary. It is a silent film, in which the horror of the unknown comes silent and slowly. The movie starts with the crop-circles, and then we realize very slowly whats going on with the aliens, the ships in the sky, the news from all around the world and the big question: Come there in peace or it is a invasion? It was a very good idea to focus almost the complete movie on the farmhouse and its residents. This is the way which most of us will probably witness the first contact (in peace or not). Sitting at home, listen mesmerized to the news on the TV and the radio and discuss about the aliens and what he will probably do or what we shall probably do. At last it clear up, that the aliens are not friendly visitors, and we find our family alone in its home, with almost nothing to defend himself...Until this point it was a very good movie, but at last the stupidity of the aliens is astonishing: Invading a planet, that was covered with approx. 2/3 of water... the stuff, that is deadly for the invaders. After i saw this movie i imagined a ridiculous scene: The aliens runs all over our planet... and it starts to rain... i imagined the Song ""Little April Shower"" from ""Bambi"" during the aliens quoting the Wicked Witch of the West from ""The Wizard of Oz"": ""I'm melting! I'm melting! Ohhhhh...What a world! What a world!""The weak end destroyed a lot of that, what the first 95% very good runtime of the film had build up. In this film M. Night Shyamalan had unfortunately failed with his last surprising twist. ""The sixth sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" are both weaker in the beginning, but the end twists are much better than in ""Signs"". So the first very good 95% of the movie deserve a 9, but the last weak 5% only a 3. Overall i give the complete movie a 7 of 10",Signs

And Signs, a relatively small, claustrophobic flick, even more so than Shyamalan's previous two, is somehow all the more powerful, and explosive, and ultimately rewarding for this sense of isolation. It is a brilliantly structured film. Fincher and Shyamalan are called the Hitchcocks of a brave new day, and I consider that praise well deserved for both directors.
But Shyamalan's works are too uniquely his own, too uniquely genre and classification defying, to be summed up with the word hitchcockian. Shyamalan tells movies, that walk the dark hinterlands of the human heart and imagination. His works are neither thrillers, nor sci-fi, nor drama, nor horror,  nor strictly fantasy but are some new and strange stew of elements. His works refuse to be pigeon-holed.And that, as you can tell has made him fans, but that has also in a world that lives and dies by labels has made him detractors. People have the right to like and dislike, what they want. But in some of the negative posts here, the venom and attacks seem almost personal. Less attacks on the work, than attacks on the idea of the work. A film is fantasy people, the best film requires your willingness to be fooled, to help suspend disbelief. It just seems a lot of you go into a Shyamalan film looking for flaws, as if you're offended personaly because his movies are so well received, and are looking to tear it down, lookin to fight the movie, and I'm going to tell you right now, a movie that you want to hate, you'll hate. A movie is like a date, its better when both parties try to make it work.You go into Signs wanting to read the signposts, and you will find a delicate, beautiful, haunting and brilliantly directed film, and yes it has a message. And yes there is a wide doe-eyed, capraesque quality to the films of Shyamalan. A vein of hope and humanity, a belief in them that runs through his works. And for me that's what makes his work masterpieces. I tend to think everything, everything has a message, from the most innane slasher flick, to the stupidest comedy, everything has a message, most messages translate into follow the crowd, or be as dumb as you want to be, or shoot the other guy, but Shyamalan presents us, in the case of Signs, a much more layered message. The ending if you let it, will hit you like a truck stop, will build on you, will grow on you, and will stay with you long, long after you leave the theater. It's the work of a master craftsman, no moment wasted.And great kudos must be given to the brilliant soundtrack by James Newton Howard, track 5 ""Brazil"" ranks up there with Goblin's ""Mad Puppet"" as one of the great horror compositions.Ranks perfectly between Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. 9/10. One of my favorite films of 2002. And looking forward to his next film. M. Night keep up the great work.",Signs

I was totally blown away by this movie, so much so I would have to categorize it as one of the best films this summer.  The creation of an atmosphere of creepiness and suspense kept me on the edge of my seat throughout and had me reacting to what was happening on-screen.  Scaring the pants off you in a thriller/scifi such as this, without hardly showing the aliens, helped build the climax to one of true suspense rather than shooting for overkill, the route chosen by many a director.  Mel Gibson is also in top form as the tortured ex-minister seeking answers and questioning his faith.  Definitely a five star film.",Signs

495,cinemaofdreams,A Murky Pseudo-Mystical Meditation,5,2 August 2002,"One of the finest films in cinematic history was a meditation on the human condition, more specifically the game-playing of the idle rich, told in the guise of a mystery story. That film was Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura. What made that film an artistic success was that Antonioni was able to hold the suspense of the mystery while he slowly peeled away at the layers to reveal the bankrupt quality of the story's characters. By the end of the picture, the mystery never being solved, the audience is too entranced by the revelation of the characters and the story beneath the surface to care about a resolution. SIGNS attempts to be such a film, but in the end after building suspense and expectation of something really profound the film ends flatly. The film is a meditation on faith, or at least a form of mystical connectivity, enveloped in the dread and fear of an alien invasion but the threads holding it together are not strong enough to move the audience to some form of catharsis or at least sense of wonder about what really motivates the characters. The acting is very good, there are some genuine frights along the way, and some very good moments of humour. Unfortunately, the sum of the parts does not equal a good movie. 5/10.",Signs
496,deltadave669,"They don't make movies like this very often, and they should!",8,5 August 2002,"Shymalan hits it out of the park again with Signs. Shymalan is the only director I think who could've pulled this movie off in the way that he did.
You probably know the bsics about this story by now, I will try to not elaborate too much on the story as I do not want to possibly spoil anything for you. The way the story plays is like a small corner of a larger story. What's going on on Graham Hess' farm is part of a global phenomenon, yet we only get the bigger picture through bits and pieces of news reports. In one way, it's like if Independence Day was told entirely through the eyes of Russell Case and his family. Shymalan takes the philosophy of ""less is more"" and applies it liberally, and to very good effect. He seems to have a good ability to know just how much to show us to let our imaginations fill in the rest. With anyone else, this movie would have been in our face with horror and special effects galore. The way Shymalan does it employs none of this, yet delivers a more profound effect. In many ways, he is the antithesis to the man he is compared to, Steven Spielberg.The acting in this movie is nothing short of fantastic. Particular kudos go to the children played by Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin. They handled their roles with the polish of seasoned professionals.Of course, there is the famous Shymalan ""suprise ending"". I will not spoil the suprise, it's not the shock ""The Sixth Sense"" was, rather it plays directly to Graham Hess' loss of faith. It brings many seemingly unrelated elements together and brings an entirely new meaning to ""the Lord works in mysterious ways"". If you're in for a well acted, well paced, and well thought out story that makes you laugh, cry, and jump in your seat. Follow the Signs and see this movie!I gave it an 8/10.",Signs
497,theshape79,"Not really scary, but better than some suggest.",7,11 January 2003,"I can't really understand why people seem to think this movie was so scary. Yeah theres an intensity to certain scenes, and some scenes have a certain atmosphere that adds to the intensity, but all in all theres nothing really jump out of my seat scary. Alien hands all of the sudden popping out from behind grates and underneath doors aren't scary. Dogs barking aren't scary. The only thing mildly scary (meaning that again something adds to a creepy atmosphere) are the aliens speaking. Besides the fact that the movie wasn't scary, I found most of it so well made it held my attention throughout. I liked the little facts that the writer/director shows us about the family and the affects tragedy that they have suffered from affecting them through the movie. I liked Mel Gibson, a stoic tough guy actor in American movies, reluctance to use profanity to scare off prowlers in the night. I like the adults interaction with the children. And the little things the kids do that make them fun to watch. And I especially like the fact that this is an alien invasion movie seen from one perspective, not some Hollywood sized Independence Day style epic with multiple big names phoning in performances whilst doing battle with aliens in what can only be described as scenes that wish they could be from Star Wars. Thats an interesting side to the story that intrigued me, even though it adds to a possible plot hole in the storyline. Throughout the movie there are no scenes of ruined desicated cities are huge alien armies. The only time we really know the aliens are attacking is when they surround the house and we can hear them instead of seeing them. That scene in particular is one the more intense scenes that the film can muster, and truly involve me as a viewer. One more note though, is the fact of faith in the movie. I know its interesting to have someone examining his faith during a time as portrayed, but doe it have to reach the level of sermonizing that it reaches in this particular film. When these scenes occur it really drags down the proccedings and puts a damper on the fun of the film.",Signs
498,j_crist,Bad (maybe spoilers),1,5 June 2003,"This guy is the most over-rated director around. The film is nothing special, it could have just been a 30 minutes tv film. There is no story really, just one plot and some attempt to create characters, but it's too superficial. Nothing to compare to any other film of the same kind. A copy of many other pictures, in the features he mention to have been inspired by three very famous classics but I don't think so, I guess he has copied something else. Is an amateur movie. Any film student could have done it better, but the question is: who made this guy an A-list director? This is (if it didn't have Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix in it) nothing more that a b-movie or direct to video. Roger Corman himself I don't think would have produced it the way it was. The script needed a revision, rewriting, the dialogues are silly and predictable, the sub-story is silly. And on top of that the director shouldn't try acting. He is patetique, to begin with is not even cast right. He doesn't match with the film, that goes for any of the ones he made.Also, a movie like this does not really cost that much money to make. Very little set (you don't need to build a house for that or grow a field of corn), very few scenes (with good actors you can film the whole in a week), as for the special effects, why making a CG character when a man with a costume would have been enough? >",Signs

This movie was a pretty freaky film as well,and it wasn't even a horror movie. Well sure it is nightmarish, but that feeling will soon go away.

501,Irish-Sunglasses,"Good acting, flawed execution",7,12 August 2002,"***SPOILERS***This movie had a lot of promise, only some of which is fulfilled. The acting, especially by Gibson and Phoenix, is believeable if somewhat understated. However the director, who appears in a cameo role, should have put someone else in his role who could really emote, as he completely lacks this basic human ability.It almost seems as if M. Night wasn't sure about what kind of movie to make. Is it a PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER? Well it seems to be at first but the source of the crop circles is revealed far too soon. I would have preferred this to be kept a mystery until later in the movie. Once it is revealed, it pretty much limits the scope of what the movie could be about. Another problem is Gibson's son, who seems to be right about everything the aliens would try to do, which further erodes the plot's suspense.After it is revealed that the aliens are making the circles and what their intentions are, you would think it would become an ACTION MOVIE. But no action is shown, and nothing at all is shown of what is going on in the rest of the world. I was not amused with the War Of The Worlds-like solution.In short, I am tired of M. Night's manipulative movies. He puts obvious clues in his movies that apparently are not noticed by 90% of the movie-going public, which explains why this movie is undeservedly in the top 250 already. Come on, wasn't it OBVIOUS that the water would be part of the solution, or that the bat hanging on the wall would be too?

The two movies are literally the exact opposite of each other. Where Sixth Sense is clever, unpredictable and intense, Signs is patronising, condescending, thoroughly predictable and painfully slow.Realistically, the plot of this movie should have consumed no more than about ten minutes, and was padded out with scenes that wanted so badly to be suspenseful - but weren't.  That was probably partly to do with the weak plot, but equally to do with the laughably bad special effects, that belonged in a 1970s movie.I wanted so well to like this after being so impressed with Shyamalan's past work.  I couldn't like it, because it was a mediocre, wishy-washy movie made even worse by the hype that preceded it.Don't waste your time - any B movie running on cable for free is likely to be as good, if not better.",Signs

I enjoyed it for what it was, but I wouldn't put it up there with those previous two films. There were some nice scenes, though, and he has a way of getting some nice spiritual moments to ring through in a way that feels right. My favorite moment was actually the goofiest, when there was the videocam capture of the alien at the children's birthday party (a nice Bigfoot cop, btw). It was kind of goofy, really, but also gave me the feeling of what it would be like to be seeing that in the situation the characters were in, and therefore the reaction was shocking as intended. I thought the performances were very good, particularly Joachin Phoenix (who I didn't like at all in Gladiator). His reactions to what was going on helped make it believable (for example, when seeing the video of the alien). If anything, the film seemed a bit too short. It took a while to get going, and then once it got going a little, it ended. I like what I saw, but I guess I expected a little more, as opposed to Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, which seemed a little more satisfying as a whole. Still worth seeing, though. I think Shyamalan is one of the best filmmakers today, and I like that he doesn't have sex and blood and excessive violence and swearing in his films.7 out of 10",Signs

I began to notice some SIGNS that I might like to see it, like when I said to my friends, do you want to see this film? A SIGN that I was actually going to see it was when I was buying my ticket in the cinema lobby. After it started, I began to notice some SIGNS that it wasn't that good. The first half of the movie is pretty slow. Then the aliens start to appear (first rule of filmmaking, don't show the alien!!!!), which was a SIGN that it was pretty bad. The ridiculous denoument was another SIGN of a not very well thought out film. Perhaps I'm seeing too many SIGNS, but that appears to be common with respect to this movie.I do have to say that everyone acted well (the kids were terrific, and I don't think that often), the direction was slick (but possibly a little too laid back), but it was all let down by a very poor story.

I went into this movie with little respect for Shyamalan. (Unlike most people, apparently, I never liked The Sixth Sense: thought it was tedious.) By half way through the Signs, I was thinking maybe I'd underestimated him. The storytelling idea here is really good: an alien invasion from the lonely perspective of ordinary people, who have no idea what's going on. The mood is fascinating.But Shyamalan snatches defeat from the jaws of victory!It's often been said that stories, like planes, are easy to get of the ground and fly, but very difficult to land. Shyamalan crashes this story with what may be the dorkiest plot fumble in the history of otherwise-good SF stories: the critical alien weakness turns out to be a severe allergy to water.Oh, dear.Back in my youth, I was an aspiring SF writer. I submitted a whole bunch of stories to SF magazines. Nearly all were rejected without explanation. The few polite notes that did explain the rejections all slammed me for numerous basic storytelling misdemeanours.

The ""uncle"" character played by Joachim Phoenix was someone who tried to be a big league ball player. He made some memorable plays but he was know as the strike out king because he gave up on himself. Mel Gibson spends the film refuting his old position as a father - a minister, and as a dad to his kids. It takes the aliens to make him come to terms with his wife's death and become the father for his kids, and his community. Having said all this, M. Knight Shamalan is a pussy.

What this movie is:  An intense film that gradually builds anticipation as the movie unfolds, with just enough scares in the movie to keep you on the edge of your seat with one eye closed.Basically, this isn't a movie with a lot of drama music incorporated into every scene.  Contrary, there is very little music, which in my opinion makes it a much more realistic experience.  Sure aliens landing on earth may sound corny, but if it were to ever happen, this movie would be a great depiction of how one family might deal with it.  And like the movie ""Unbreakable"", this one also has a special twist at the end, which I won't give away.  This is probably one of the best examples of how a movie can be used to build up intensity and anticipation as it goes along until finally the big climax at the end.  One could argue that it is kind of slow , without a lot of action going on, but it more than makes up for it in other ways, such as a real plot-line, imagine that!

512,simonize-1,A very slight film from a one hit director,3,18 October 2004,"SIGNS is memorable only in that it fails on so many levels to entertain. This is a film worthy of a PG rating, whether or not it was given one. The two HESS children were amusing in that they were more attuned to the danger than the two adults; that they possessed the instincts of animals. I suppose I should not have been surprised that the adults would be less likely to believe what was going on around them. Nor should I have been surprised that Father GRAHAM HESS, experiencing a loss of faith, should be the last one to accept the possibility of an alien invasion.On the whole I felt the problems with SIGNS centred about the two adult male leads. First I did not feel that the former FATHER GRAHAM HESS, especially as played by Gibson was capable of showing either empathy towards others (the two key scenes involving the poor girl who wanted to confess, and the unfortunate man who had fallen asleep at the wheel, before hitting Gibson's wife). After listening to the girl in the pharmacy he tells his family never to be with her alone; and after hearing Ray's sincere apology, Gibson's character is incapable of acknowledging this).I thought that the director's judgment was terrible to not letting Gibson lose it totally around the final dinner table, but chose to cut to the beginning of the home invasion. However nothing I had seen would convince me that Gibson could lose it, and break down, as an actor.[POSSIBLE SPOILERS)So when the film concludes with Gibson putting the cloth back on, I was not so much surprised, as I was bewildered: his character, at least, as played by Gibson, seemed to be a very unlikely candidate for priesthood!As to Joaquin Phoenix I could not believe this was a man capable of launching a baseball 507 feet! I found it difficult to swallow watching Phoenix in GLADIATOR going up against a far beefier Russell Crowe (who at least looked the part).The final sequence in which Merrill has to swing a baseball bat seemed to a token attempt to appease the audience who had seen no combat at all... despite the son's warning that most of the action would be hand to hand, so that nuclear weapons would be avoided.All in all, I thought the level of invention and execution was on par for what I would expect of a made for TV film (and many would be far more entertaining than SIGNS).

Although he obviously is talented I find it very hard to put up with the heavy depressive atmosphere that colors all of his films. All characters become wooden, depressive, humorless and irritating. Mourning, that this family is supposed to be feeling, is not at all the same as catatonic stupor or clinical depression as the director seems to imply. To appear to be suicidal is not the same as having a deep emotional inner world. I find this film simplistic, corny, cliché and very predictable. The director's skilled, no question about that, but he's sadly lacking in humor and vitality. All his films are disturbing in an unpleasant way. Ingmar Bergman and many others do not give you a similar unpleasant feeling although they also deal with difficult questions. I've always felt that this director is very overrated.",Signs

It does take this movie a little time to get going, but once it does, it is a very good, creepy movie, until it ends, then you are left wondering if the same person wrote the end that did the rest of the movie. It just feels too tacked on and rushed.  Make yourself watch the beginning, enjoy the creepy middle, then scratch your head and the ending.",Signs
517,daisuke69,could have been good but crashed in the end,4,23 January 2003,"*possible minor spoilers*this movie starts out ok... builds up tension until it´s halfway done... and then it crashes and burns later. the alien crop signs are nothing but bull to bring alien movie geeks into the movie theather, the use and treatment of these signs is simplistic at best, no real meaning is attached to them. in the end it switches to other signs completelythe movie is full of cliches altho it does have some good moments, the end result of it all tho is to produce a film that doesn´t make you think about things, it just sort of tries to rudely and forcefully stick ideas into your head about everything being predestined, this director can´t seem to leave things a bit up in the air, he has to make everything extremely apparent for all the dumb moviegoers who can´t figure out the idea behind the title, same thing happened at the end of unbreakable and 6th sense, only these movies were a lot better!!! and he´s not going to get it because of all the good comments this movie got.the fact that aliens can´t even open doors is stupid, the aliens themselves look brutal and dumb, and they´re naked!!! not the kind of thing you´d expect to be capable of space travel and again... how can they be alergic to water??? at least war of the worlds came up with a better idea!!!this thing just tried to put too many things into one turning from a possible ET good alien scenario into a sort of close encounters of the 3rd kind undecided scenario and then into an independance day movie only now the aliens are pansies who can´t break down a door and run around naked with nothing but poisonous spines to enslave the local population, ludicrous!! I guess it was all about addressing xenophobia and religion and destiny and so on and so fort..... ughI always wanted to see a movie like this about ppl who are nothing in the great sceme of things during an alien invasion or the group of ensigns in star trek who always seem to get killed. now that I´ve seen it I never want to see it again, at least I can thank shymalan for showing us how bad these movies can be.oh and don´t forget the crop signs have absolutely no significant role in giving the movie it´s name.All this said, the movie had the potential to be very good, it does keep you on the edge of your seat for about 3/4s of the movie and delivers a couple of good scares, the ending is what really spoils this film, it just takes the worst possible story tangent and flops into cliche and moral.",Signs
518,Oreolove,Swing Away!,10,3 August 2002,"What a spectacular movie! I read many reviews before going to see this, (which was set in my home town of Bucks County!! You wouldn't believe the turn out on opening night.) Anyway, many of the reviews said that this movie was either confusing at the end or had nothing to do with aliens. Both of which are completely false. The whole story was based upon the aliens and only a small portion was based on the story surrounding Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his disbelief in a higher power after the death of his wife. The ending was not confusing in the least. It was straight to the point and left you with a secure feeling, (unlike other movies of this genre.) The nightmare begins when, in the very first scene of the movie, Hess' family discovers huge crop circles on their property. They are so perfect that many believe they couldn't have been created by man. And it is a 'sign' of the coming of the end of the world. Hess refuses to believe that they were created by a higher power, since he gave up his faith and job as a minister after the death of his wife. Aided only by his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) to take care of his son and daughter, (Rory Culkin and adorable Abigal Breslin), Graham tries as hard as he can to find another explanation to this phenomenon. But it turns out that the critters from space have plans for the population of the earth. And Hess is running out of time to save his family.Now it's time to talk about the superb acting. I must say that, as usual, Joaquin Phoenix did a excellent job. No words were needed to tell exactly what he was thinking. I was surprised, however, to see that he was the comic relief, a role he hardly ever plays. But he pulled it off beautifully and had a real sense of how to demand attention. I found myself gasping and biting my nails in one scene and then laughing hysterically in the next, all because Phoenix would casually make a comment that eased the tension. (Look out for scenes where he explains why he believes in miracles and why nerds don't have girlfriends, they left me panting on the floor of the theater.) Then he would break into a totally serious performance that left me in shock. Mel Gibson did his usual serious/concerned act. But he does it well. In many scenes, you can see exactly how torn he is between the idea of the aliens being a gift from a higher power or yet another curse to destroy his family. His does a wonderful job playing the fatherly figure. But the Oscar goes to Abigal Breslin. She reminded me so much of the little, 3 year old girl I babysit that I actually wanted to give her a big hug and tell her not to cry. It broke my heart so much to see her tear up that I had to remind myself she was just acting. And she can't be more than 5 years old! It simply amazed me how well she did. Rory Culkin also pulled off one of his best performances. Unlike his brother's career that came to a steaming halt, I believe that he will go much farther after this movie.In conclusion, I would just like to say that this is a top notch picture and deserves the 10 out of 10 stars I gave it. The first time you see it, it will keep you in suspense the entire time. The tension will literally keep your eyes glued to the screen. *Just remember to wear your tinfoil hat!",Signs
519,ZMBKLR,A waste of my money,1,12 August 2002,"This was quite possibly, with the exception of A.I., one of the worst films I've been displeased to sit through. What a contrived bunch of nonsense. So a bunch of naked aliens, who came trillions of miles (and really had no place in the film), who can't break down a door (please note that one door that gets boarded up opens AWAY from the boards), can't (even though they have five inch claws) claw through some bags of dog food and are vulnerable to WATER (then why come to a planet which, along with it's inhabitants are 70% water?), help a man regain his faith in god? How was this? Why did these aliens need Crop Circles? If it was for navigation, why were they in space? If it was to mark the house as potential victims, why that? I found this film to be just a mess, kind of an anti-Close Encounters. And what's with that utterly reprehensible ending, with an alien getting beaten to death with a baseball bat? I don't know why this film is getting such great reviews, since it was a mess. I didn't like Unbreakable, which was another contrived mess and I'll likely never watch this film again, putting it on the permanent shelf with A.I.",Signs
520,captainmarvel1331,Shyalaman's best film yet.,9,13 October 2005,"I have seen all of Shyalaman's films, including the newer ""The Village"", but Signs takes home the gold. The film has some truly terrifying moments and you never know what will happen next or where, which always keeps you on your toes, trying to look out for little details to help you figure out some kind of indication to a future scary moment. I believe Shyalaman was aware of that so he very carefully situated the setting and the script. The cast is good which includes Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The movie uses their relationship along with the kids to help move along the movie. It works well because the movie focuses s lot around family. The movie also shares the center point with faith.During a midnight conversation between Gibson and Phoenix, Gibson makes us ask ourself if we believe in coincidence or faith. He explains that we either think everything happens for a reason, or that its all chance. We never know what the right answer is or what Gibson thinks at the end of the film which keeps us guessing. And that's always nice.But what truly makes this a Shyalaman classic is the suspense and the horror. And that's saying something because the only other recently modern movie that had us this scared was The Ring. Some scenes are so scary that I actually saw people walk out of the theater. Not just kids either. One specific scene shows Phoenix watching TV and suddenly we see an alien run through someones drive-way in Brazil. It's really sudden and very scary. But I didn't like what Shyalaman shows us in the end of the film, which I won't give away.Overall, the movie has a nice take on the whole crop circle idea and has a nice ending. The movie works for all genres really; drama, family, horror, suspense, and a little comedy. This is really Shyalaman's best film yet.",Signs
521,bigbillyt,Signs of what?,1,9 August 2002,"Signs of great filmmaking? I don't think so.First of all I am pretty angry about several things. First, I am particularly distressed that the individuals posting here who liked the movie insist on accusing those of us who didn't of needing some kind of over the top special effects to enjoy a film. WRONG! I can think of many great films that did not need exploitative or gratuitous effects and were fantastic films. I can also think of films that had great effects and were still pretty bad movies, Independence Day comes to mind. My taste runs from Woody Allen to John Carpenter and I try hard to judge each film on its own merits. Speaking of John Carpenter he did a bang up job with Starman with minimal effects and the Jenny Hayden character was able to regain her faith after the death of her husband without me feeling totally manipulated and ripped off. Secondly, I am a bit confused by the overall rating of 8+ when so many people seem to share my sentiments. Mostly I am mad that I paid good money and wasted the time to see this film.!!CONTAINS SPOILERS!!I do not understand the comparisons to Hitchcock. I am a big Hitchcock fan and the only thing I can think of that is similar is the theme of an average guy caught up in unusual circumstances. I guess you could also say that Shyamalan is trying to build suspense through psychological terror instead of doing it overtly. Unfortunately he uses every obvious psychological gimmick in the book to yank the audience's chain. Hitchcock was much more subtle with a long buildup and lots of character exploration prior to things getting heavy. The main problem with this film is that the story fails to perform the most important function to make the premise work. There is very little information given to help us understand or like these characters. The most glaring example of this is the characters' reaction to the two dogs dying. The main characters are totally insensitive to the deaths of the beloved family pets. When the boy kills the first dog the family is barely upset about it and the second one is carelessly left outside for the evil aliens to massacre. If I ever wanted to try to like these characters or care about them it eventually becomes impossible. Then there is the matter of a total lack of background and believability. As many others have stated, why is he a farmer as well as a preacher? If he is a farmer, does he do any farming type stuff, ever? Where was Merrill before all this happened? What compelled him to come help Graham out? Neither Mel Gibson's nor Joaquin Phoenix's character reacts or behaves as one would expect people in this rural setting, or anywhere else for that matter, to act. They also do not seem to behave consistently within the parameters of who they are supposed to be. Actually, so little background is given, it is hard to figure out who they are supposed to be. I find it hard to believe that anybody who was just told that their neighbor has an alien locked in the pantry would not even try to pry some additional information from them. I don't care what the history between the two people is, basic survival instinct would dictate that you would want to know as much as possible. Same thing when they are locked in the house and then the basement. I am appalled that these guys supposedly care about these kids and don't even pick up one of the many gardening tools lying about to prepare to even try to defend themselves. Especially since Merrill was the baseball player who would swing at anything. It was almost painful to see two really good actors like Mel and Joaquin made to play such two-dimensional characters with such rigid, stilted dialogue. Mel's monologue about there being two kinds of people was good but seemed out of place when the rest of the time his character was basically despondent. Why was the stuff about the redneck neighbors even mentioned? The little boy was precocious to the point of being annoying. The little girl was cute and quirky. The lady sheriff was an engaging character and very well portrayed by Cherry Jones. She was actually the one saving grace of the film.I could go on and on about the ridiculousness of the whole aliens with an aversion to water who are going to invade our planet to harvest humans using ground tactics nonsense but I think we need to go ahead and bury that horse. There are so many holes in the plot and script that my head is ready to explode trying to comprehend how M. Night could have made this film. I loved Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I thought his slow, deliberate style of storytelling was totally appropriate in the context of those two films. However, Mr. Shyamalan needs to recognize that different stories require different treatments. Just because this formula worked a couple of times before does not mean he can make every movie using the same kind of devices and stylistic elements. I think he is a very talented writer and director who just needs to grow up and get over himself.I also share the sentiment of many who feel cheated by virtue of the trailers for this film. I do believe that when we, as the paying, movie going public are marketed to, that the filmmaker or distributor should have a responsibility to make the marketing reflect at least some of the flavor of the film. I basically feel like I was tricked into watching what was essentially an exercise in how much the viewer could be manipulated with the fewest possible resources in terms of sets, effects and dialogue. A kind of minimalism carried to the point of absurdity.I will see M. Night's next exploit, only because I now feel like he owes me something and I would like to give him the chance to make up for this fiasco.One last comment: One of the other reviewers on this board suggested that this was all a nightmare the little girl was having. That would actually make the most sense out of everything. Unfortunately, I do not believe that was the intended twist. I think M. Night would have made it more obvious at the end if that was the case. I really wish that he had.",Signs
522,lgilbertom,It's a good suspense movie (minor spoilers),8,24 September 2002,"Signs is a good suspense movie, with good performances of the Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The basic plotline is Gibson a man that lost his wife and faith, one day found strange circles in his farm. His first clue, is some guys was responsible for this strange marks. However, the true is very different, aliens are responsible for this marks and prepare an invasion. This fact will be affect very deeply the life of Graham's family.This movie is basically about fear and lost, the suspense is a little impaired, because the aliens are shown explicit and clear in the middle of the movie. In my opinion, there are some aspects in the movie that are little artificial (About aliens and water), but this is a minor flaw. My general impression, is that Signs is a good movie, with a good story a solid performances of Phoenix and Gibson.",Signs
523,bobtheplanet,Sign of the Times,1,23 January 2007,"Preacher loses his faith in God, gets it back by whacking an Alien.What is wrong with this picture? There it is... poor craftsmanship due to Superfluous Novelty. Shyamalan's ""style"" seems to just that... all style, no substance. Maybe he is trying to use the William Burroughs method of ""cut-up"" storytelling - you write something - chop it into snippets - and then reassemble it randomly. I believe that Anime is written this way. Put a lot of unrelated ideas on little slips of paper, mix them in a bowl, and then pull out a few to create characters and plot. Like: Samurai/Robot/Bus driver - good protagonist! Amphibious/Demon/Wombats - what a villain! Moon Landing/Nuclear/Earthquake - sets the stage! All this makes you SEEM to be creative and innovative. But it all falls flat without some thread of continuity to it. Some people can do it (i.e., ""The Birds"") and others can't (i.e., ""Signs"").This movie tries to do 2 things simultaneously and succeeds at neither. As a morality fable of 'lost faith', it's main character is not believable to me - he's just a plot device. As some sort of Science Fiction 'thriller', it was not suspenseful and relied on pointless and overused 'boogeyman' thrills - I suppose it looks good in the trailers to get the crowds in. I liked ""The Sixth Sense"" , it was OK. I watched ""Unbreakable"" and found it pointlessly arbitrary and confusing; like a jigsaw puzzle made from several different boxes. I have not seen ""The Village"" or ""Lady in the Water"", but they both sound like a further deterioration in his film-making career.",Signs
524,crooked_spoons,Subtlety: Don't expect an over-exaggerated special-effects feast..,10,30 June 2006,"This is a film (much like Shyamalan's other films)that requires a viewers full focus, and heightened sense of awareness. Other movies of this genre tend to go too far over the top with the ""creep factor"" in the place of a good storyline. Because there was no dead girl slithering out of a well and ""the creatures"" fail to tear the Hess family limb from bloody limb. The concept of this movie can easily be lost on those of a..shall we say...simple minded nature. Shayamalan's characters (Gibson and Phoenix, mainly) each have their own separate issues coming into this story. Creating ""sub-plots"" here and there that cause the viewer shift his/her focus away from the aliens, to the human characters. Thus, enhancing the element of surprise when, such creatures, make an appearance. The fact that as a viewer, you are not bombarded with special effects, or CGI creatures at every turn, creates frightening circumstances, and causes the viewer to constantly expect something (anything) to happen at any given moment. The way Shyamalan limits the viewer's sightings of the ""beings"" is cause for praise. In the every last scene of this movie, everything, every element, every piece of dialogue fits together like a complete jigsaw puzzle. Even things that appear to be most insignificant suddenly have this profound meaning. A fact which is no cause for surprise given the writer. However for those who fail to see this fact should either re-watch this film, or watch something ""a little deeper""...hmm, perhaps ""Saw I&II"" should do the trick.No other film out there has ever evoked the feeling of shear terror in the pit of the stomach of the viewer on the level in which Signs does.",Signs
525,Killer-40,Cheap Faith in a wasted topic,1,31 July 2002,"***SPOILER-WARNING*** For the first time in my life I really want to give away the main content of a movie to spare others great disappointment. E.g. the crop-circle fans and specialists whom the movie abuses because it neither provides up-to-date interpretations of the phenomena, nor will the crop-circle (known from the ad) play an important role at all. It's the typical US-American fear of invasion - in this case: of aliens - that dictates the film. So it plays with recent events of mass hysteria. Ironically, Mel Gibson's role as a pastor who lost face about a common thing like the death of a beloved gets his faith back when he meets his wife again as an alien. And more ironically, after he has ordered her killing, not detecting her for what she really is and misunderstanding her last words as a human being and her rescue-effort as an alien for her asthmatic son (by a special in-breathing system that the aliens possess). Actually, it is water that kills the alien. More scientific bull***, as we know for years know that esp. water raises the possibility that we are not alone. So - what in the end has director Shyamalan told us? That Christian faith is ridiculous? That we don't know who's our friend and who's not? That one X-Files episode can create a more interesting environment than a big budget movie? That he doesn't know how to end a movie elegantly after building up some tension? Well, thank you, Mr. Shyamalan, at least we understand this: Hollywood just isn't spiritual enough.",Signs
526,EdExtract,CLICHÉS would have been a more descriptive title,3,2 December 2002,"Sometimes the really bad movies inspire me to write in.
I saw SIGNS before reading NYT or WASHINGTON POST reviews, so I think I was unbiased.  As a science fiction fan I have learned to suffer through a lot of eye-rolling silliness; generally I'm fairly forgiving.  Also, when I saw SIGNS, I didn't know the movie was made by the director of SIXTH SENSE, so I wasn't looking to compare this film to that top notch ghost thriller.  I just wanted to be entertained by a good movie, one I had heard did fantastic at the box office.Sadly I was bored and disappointed by this movie, and I was relieved to see critics from some of the USA's biggest papers had the same feelings.  The aliens were laughable (in fact they should never have been shown), and little of what I saw seemed fresh after so many episodes of X-FILES covered the exact same ground with better production, acting, and a necessary dose of eye-twinkling satire.I couldn't help comparing this dull movie to Kevin Costner's little sparkler, DRAGONFLY, which got so many withering, spiteful reviews. Similar themes, that were explored fairly well in Costner's film, are laughably diced and served cold in SIGNS.  Somehow, maybe because of his huge budget films that bombed, Costner has become something of a Hollywood embarrassment, so his films, reviewed by critics who like to feel hip and in with the elite, now seem doomed in the press well before a cast is chosen, whatever the film's true merit.  Many of the reviews of DRAGONFLY are filled with barely concealed attacks on Costner's character.  No, DRAGONFLY wasn't a film that we'd rate as one of the 100 best of all times, but unless hatred for Costner colors one's judgment, by any standards it was entertaining and moving.But because SIGNS did so well at the box office, its bland hash of mawkishness, contrived, clichéd weirdness with dogs and water, and goblin-like body snatchers from another world will earn the director, who really should hang his head in shame, a pat on the back.DRAGONFLY was a solid film that explored the edges of sanity that grieving widowers risk plunging over.  Costner's character was believably neurotic in efforts to retain some of what he lost when his wife died.  But in SIGNS, Gibson's performance seems contrived, a goofy attempt at somber homage to a lost American stoicism.  In his performance he seems too self-conscious to be credible; I had the sense throughout he was overacting by under-acting. The result is Gibson never becomes his character, he just goes through motions that make him seem to be an amateur actor.  Based on Gibson's countless fine performances, I'm sure this is the fault of the director who was trying for the foggy stiffness that succeeded well in SIXTH SENSE.
This is just about as bad as WATERWORLD or even THE POSTMAN, but in a smaller, more stifling way, and with more clichés packed into less time. The science in this science fiction film is hideously tortured, as if the makers of the film are sneering at America's abysmal math and science education, as if they thought, ""Oh, the movie audience is so dumb, let's use the most banal substance we can think of to be the aliens' Achilles' heel.Truly, upon reflection, the movie is so blandly bad that it isn't worth making fun of its many blunders.If you have any respect for the genre of science fiction, any hope that movies can be better; if you wish producers would assume that intelligent life exists in the audience, give this one a pass.",Signs
527,critic_w,"Typical Shyamalan slow, creepy, realistic, fun, excellent!",9,6 August 2002,"This movie is slow, and yet it starts up with an event in the first minute. It's scary, and yet you're (almost) never really terrified. Advancing with Welles-like realism, it carefully chronicles world-changing strange events from the perspective of just one family in a small town, seemingly cut off from the rest of the world.  At moments simultaneously reminiscent of both War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, there's a mildly claustrophobic feeling to the entire film. Sometimes it's so suffocating, you are desperate for the sparsely placed moments of comedy. One could argue that it's so weighty, that it causes Mr. Shyamalan's role IN the movie to seem self-indulgent. Not as much as when Spike Lee does it, but bad enough to be a distraction. I probably wouldn't complain if the writer/director/producer AND actor had a better sense of how to use animals in his script. Without spoiling anything, I will say that the film does not disappoint the patient viewer. You will unravel both the story of the Hess family and their mysterious crop circles, even if one on top of the other. All that you patiently worked to figure out will come around for you in a very satisfying way.",Signs
528,dmkay,"Intense, terrific suspense thriller",10,11 February 2004,"Along with Alien and The Thing, Signs deserves to be considered one of the scariest alien films of all time.  The best thing about Signs is its intensity...this movie builds suspense smoothly and steadily, never letting up for a minute.  Unlike many films, there are almost no ""filler"" scenes here.  You're glued to your seat the entire time.  Sound and bare glimpses of the aliens are used to great effect.  The film feels real, the characters believable.  Some don't like the kids, but I think they're both great...although the girl is better than the boy, who is a little too much like the smart little boy in Sixth Sense (a movie I didn't like as well as Signs).The only drawback to Signs is the ending...which I think is a little silly but doesn't ruin an otherwise great film.  And yes, Signs does have more than its fair share of haters, just like The Ring (another very scary film), probably due to some people's habit of hating very good films that are also very popular (think Titanic).  The only people who could truly hate Signs are people who think movies are supposed to be an intellectual experience rather than an emotional one.  10 out of 10.",Signs
529,mjanky,A Fun Time At The Theater,10,5 August 2002,"This was a very entertaining, and enjoyable movie for myself and my family. It's obvious that a lot of IMDB users, use Citizen Kane, The Godfather and Schindler's List as their basis for comparison to every movie they review, so they'll always have plenty to complain about. Fortunately, I'm not such a movie geek that I have to expound on each aspect of the film and I can look at it objectively for what it is; an opportunity to escape into the lives of some characters and watch them solve the problems that life throws at them. With that in mind, ""Go see this movie."" It's a good story to take your mind of off whatever problems you might be having and I can guarantee if you go, not expecting 'Gone With The Wind', you won't be disappointed. You should laugh, you may cry, you'll definitely jump out of your seat on occasion, only when you're not sitting on the edge of it. The movie provides some good discussion points, so you can talk about it afterwards over pizza with whomever you saw it with. What more could be expected? The story-line and plot-points have all been beat to death hear so I won't go there, but I would like to make some observations. I think M. Night Shyamalan's main interest is entertaining his audience, ala Spielberg, Hanks, and Eastwood. I'm sure if it was his goal to win a Best Movie oscar he could produce garbage like 'Sakespeare In Love' or 'American Beauty', but I believe it's more important to him that his film 'entertains' rather than 'achieve' and I applaud him for that. Another more selfish comment is that I would've really liked to have seen Bruce Willis in the Mel Gibson role. Not that Mel was bad, I thought he played the part well, but it would've been interesting to see how Bruce would've played it, while shooting the hat-trick with M. Night, after The Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable. My last point is, don't read more into the story than what it is, 'characters struggling against outside forces of conflict.' If you do that, you'll enjoy the film, but if you do feel compelled to analyze every frame, you may want to stay home and rent Casablanca instead.",Signs

His daughter, a really cute Abigail Breslin, has aphobia with the condition of her drinking water that plays a big partin the climax of the film.

M goes at it, unlike Spielberg, largely through his script work, the way he puzzle together the elements of character, dialogue, structure. Often, the epiphany of his work is the coming together of all the elements which crystalizes into his point.  The glasses of water all over the house, the little boy's asthma, the strike out king...all these elements climax into Gibson's character's absolution.  The leads are all wonderfully written and performed.  There are scenes that stand out in my mind but given the Spielberg proclamation (made by Time or Newsweek, I don't recall), the one that stands tallest is the dinner table one where Gibson finally starts to go to pieces.  Thinking back on it now, I don't remember if mashed potatoes were involved, but it did play like a rift on Spielberg and Dreyfuss'dinner scene in ""Close Encounters.""",Signs

537,pcast99-1,"It isn't terrible, but it's still illogical.",4,8 April 2012,"I am going to say I don't hate this movie but to me it is rather bad and the plot has some huge holes in it that some people need to consider before praising this movie.The whole movie deals with aliens that have touched down and are terrorizing Mel Gibson and his family, by the way Mel Gibson in this movie is a lapsed priest after his wife died in a car accident.The idea sounds interesting, but there are huge plot holes in this movie: 1. Water is lethal to the aliens which will kill them by contact, yet the aliens came to a planet covered by 75 percent of water, precipitation is constant and dew settles on corn at night, so the aliens running through the field should have been killed instantly.2. When the aliens finally break into the home the family fleas into the basement, and the aliens that are capable of inter-space travel and cloaking their space ships cannot get through a wooden door.3. After the family holds them off, the next day Joaquin Phoenix opens the door and goes upstairs without taking the ax or any other weapon with him, sounds extremely ignorant to me.This whole scenario is ridiculous but on a positive note the movie does have some pretty good scares and an effective soundtrack, and the acting wasn't bad either.But those things are not enough to save this film for me, but those reading this if you can stand giant plot holes then by all means see this film, but all others it's better to avoid it, watch M Night's previous two films instead.",Signs

Do I even need to bother giving a review since what I'm going to say has already been said? The aliens are stupid. They have advanced technology and yet eschew it in favor of making circles in fields and fighting hand to hand. They travel all the way to a world where 70% of the surface is covered in water even though it is incredibly corrosive to them. They don't even bother with any kind of protection from water. Just what do they want from Earth that can't be found on water-free planets, anyway?The film ends with a religious message, which only makes the already flawed film worse, in my opinion. The film illustrates the notion that everything has a purpose with a series of rather implausible coincidences (if only all the terrible things that happened to me and people I know turned out to be part of a divine plan rather than rotten luck...) Issues like how aliens fit into Christian theology (that could have actually made for some interesting discussion) are conspicuously absent.Despite the atrocious flaws I've highlighted, the film does have its bright spots. It is indeed rather creepy in places and has some redeeming moments. Still, they simply can't save it from the nonsense that pervades the movie.",Signs
540,micattak,Beautiful and creepy (8/10),8,17 September 2002,"This is a new kind of horror flick! Of course some people would disagree but I think it is.The start of the movie is a homage to early Sci-Fi flicks. It shows of the great score of the film, why the credits go by. It's innovative in a certain retro kind of way. Some of the beautiful shots and scene setups that the team around writer/director M. Night Shyamalan have created just need to be seen to be believed.I will mention on which comes later on in the movie. I try to stay spoiler free:The scene starts of with Graham (Mel Gibson) and Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) checking something (I just cannot reveal what). And suddenly they notice something, and then the camera shows you, why they are so baffled. You see, and you believe you found it. That's when you let your guard down. You have built up some tension, because you were expecting something, you see it, and are relieved, since it's not as bad as you thought. And then the scene really hits you. BAM. Unexpected. Fear builds up. The perfect horror movie.Another scene seems to me to pay homage to ""Blair Witch Project"". It's utterly dark. You here. All around you. Screeching. Tapping. You just cannot make anything of it. And then the light goes back on. You see Bo (Grahams daughter) standing in the corner, facing away. This seems to be in homage to Blair Witch, who relied heavily on sounds. If you remember the film ended with the ""controversial Mike stands in the corner"" shot.Like all Shyamalan films this has another last minute revelation. Not as heavy as Sixth Sense, but nonetheless. Although I am not a religious  person at all, I found it quite nice and unobtrusive. Some people may think more of it (Mel Gibson after all plays a former Reverend) but I don't. It's just the story.But all in all this is a definite must see. Most of the performances are just great, and the camera work is nice. Go see it. I gave it 8/10",Signs

Mel Gibson plays an ex-priest who gave up on praying after his wife past away. He and his family start to experience strange things, like finding crops circles and seeing weird creatures outside the house. The storyline of the film is solid and very entertaining, there is no gore in this movie which is a relief because even a gore fan can get tired of to much blood in movies. The acting is good and very well done, now for the scary parts, they didn't show perfectly the aliens which wasn't that bad, there were scenes that did make me jump and did give goosebumps, though some scenes may be a little bit too predictable the movie is still very well done.

542,gsanvin,Great performers wasted by poor story,6,14 April 2003,"I thought the performances by all those in the film were very good but the story was a bit silly and incoherent with an abrupt ending that took me by surprise as there appeared to be several loose ends in the story that were yet to be resolved. The most glaring hole in the story was water.  As we find out water is what kills the aliens much like the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz. Knowing that why would they come to a planet that is 75% water and frequented by rain, sleet and snow? Other silly parts of the story are that the aliens move so fast in the opening scenes that neither Mel Gibson or Joaquin Phoenix can hope to catch up with them on foot. Yet by the end of the film the local vet has one locked up in his pantry and it can't seem to move fast enough to avoid a baseball bat.",Signs

Also the cinematography was down from his past films. Where were the panoramas of crop circles? On the TV news only. Better luck next time.",Signs
544,Anton_Klink,A perfect alien invasion movie - and a complete opposite of Independence Day (thankfully!),8,25 November 2002,"Some say director M. Night is trying to hammer in a message of some sort with this movie and it will sit with those generally in favour of the idea and not that much with generally opposed to the idea. I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I won't tell you what the idea is, but let me tell you this much - I'm one of those generally opposed to the idea that is supposedly being hailed but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie!The handling of tension and alien terror is superb - I've seen all the Men in Blacks, Predators, Aliens, Independence Days etc etc that have been thrown at as within the past ten years and let me tell you, this is BY FAR the among the best alien invasion movies to date.Director M. Night has some of the most amazing directorial talent that has surfaced in recent times in Hollywood and all of his past three films (the two previous ones being Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) have been fantastic, each in its different way. It is just amazing how this guy manages to craft three so different yet so absolutely intriguing and perfect movies in a row.As for this specific movie, I cannot remember when I was last gripped with so much suspense I had skin crawling all over during the climactic finale (must have been The Matrix). Additionally, this movie produced some of the best startling scenes in recent memory - a truly innocent situation involving a dog which almost made me spill hot tea all over myself. It's been years since any movie has truly and honestly startled me. Forget all the ""SLAM! (door shuts unexpectedly)"" or ""oh my god, it was only the cat!"" el-cheapo thrills ""horror"" movies seem to be relying upon more and more these days (just finished watching ""Halloween Resurrection"" a few days prior, a prime example) - Signs has directorial talent written all over it, it grips you and never lets you go until the satysfying conclusion, or maybe even not then.The one thing I'm ambivalent about is the director's continual references to India throughout his movies. In a way its cute, the director himself being a Hindu, but sometimes his Hindu characters (including those played by himself) appear out of place. In a way its a nice Hitchcockian touch, in another it is a bit distracting.The other thing I was initially taken aback was the lack of Bruce Willis or Haley Joel Osmond and their substitution with Mel Gibson and another kid of the seemingly endless stream Culkins. I know Willis or Osmond weren't even considered for these roles, but it would have been nice to have a pure-blooded trilogy complete with the same excellent actors. It didn't take much for me though to accept Gibson and Culkin, they were excellent in their roles.The conclusion itself though, I do admit, may be lacking for some. Those people probably loved Independence Day and were waiting for something similar. I for one HATED Independence Day (an embodyment of stupid film-making taken to the extreme) so I cannot express my thanks enough here to mr M. Night for giving us such a perfect alien invasion movie, truly worthy of the more demanding and intelligent yet still fun- and suspense-loving movie-goers out there. Its about time someone took a different approach and told a different story than the hopelessly dated ""kill mothership/main alien during the finale thus saving the world"" dribble which has been told just way too many times already.Once again, thank you mr M. Night, for this movie experience to remember - needless to say, I'm breathless in anticipation for your next movie, but even if it's not worthy of your three previous ones, you will still have made movie-making history with your existing trilogy as it is.",Signs
545,rleather,Well.... what can you say!?,3,10 February 2003,"Quite a lot has already been said about this movie already. Certainly, if its director/writer wanted to cause a stir of mixed opinion then he succeeded.Spoilers Ahead.Me? Well I went from being highly impressed with scenes such as whenJoaquin Phoenix sees the alien in Rio, the reaction being so good you jump with him. Then we have the sheer horror as he replays the clip. Such a memorable scene and this marked the down hill point of the film for me.Then we go over to the sheer insanity of the 'plot hole circumventor' UFO book that explains the alien ray-gun ban so 'mankind won't use nuclear weapons'.Why bother? Given my next points..But most amusing of all is the fact that aliens with such an aversion to water seem to pick on a planet whose surface is 4/5s water and whose 'food source' is 70-80% water. Which also caused me some concern of the alien picking Rio in the first place. It's probably one the most humid places on the planet.Oh, but while we're on the subject, lets not forget the susceptibility to large twigs. You can imagine the scene on the mother ship. ""We've taken over the entire Earth beloved leader"" Shortly followed by ""Hold on!! Oh, my god! Look out he's got a piece of wood! Run for you're lives!'And would that ancient 'Arabian' or 'Eastern' attack method be smacking the scrawny sods with a bit of 2 by 4? One can only guess.I think I laughed through the last 10 minutes of the film (much to everyone's annoyance) as these thoughts and more went through my mind.I'm sure if I watched it again I would pickup the merit points. After all, there are so many good parts to the film in the opening parts. Plus the fact it didn't turn into 'Independence Day' was a bonus I feel. After all, this was a story about a family, about loosing (and then regaining) faith. I guess what it really is about is 'about time M. Night Shyamalan stopped taping 'shock endings' onto the end of his films. What did Hitchcock once say? ""I am a typed director. If I made Cinderella, the audience would immediately be looking for a body in the coach.""",Signs
546,cgfry,A very odd story,6,27 January 2003,"Just saw this on DVD, and wonder about the high rating it's received on IMDB.  Great acting helped very much with this slow moving piece.  But the scares are non-existent, so there really was not much build up in suspense; OK, maybe a bit with the basement scene, but with the slow pacing of the movie, it seemed to take forever to get there.  The story has some very odd twists that in the end just don't work.The most interesting parts of the movie were the religious conclusions.  I didn't expect a religious theme in this movie, and am always pleased when Hollywood chooses to deal straightforwardly with such difficult topics. Introducing aliens and combining a large series of weird character traits and actions are very odd--and certainly not straightforward--ways to surmise that ""God exists.""  I'm still not 100% certain what to think, and perhaps that's a good thing to say about a movie like Signs.  Even so, the movie mainly leaves you with that uncomfortable feeling that it could have been a lot better.",Signs

I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if aliens are taking over the damn planet, I want to see some damn aliens. This movie tries to be an update on ""The Night of the Living Dead"" but unfortunately Mel Gibson is not good enough of an actor to pull it off and Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get enough to do. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one and rent the much, MUCH better ""Unbreakable"". 2 out of 5.",Signs
548,dltdvd,Another M. Night triumph...,7,3 August 2002,"""Signs,"" starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who helmed ""The Sixth Sense,"" could possibly be one of the best films of 2002, so far. Yet again, Shyamalan treats his viewers with some Hitchcockian-style camera angles, which provide enhanced suspense for an already suspenseful picture.Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, a former reverend-farmer who recently lost his faith in God over the death of his wife. His younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), a former Minor League Baseball player, helps support Graham's children Morgan and Bo Hess (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin). Before long, the family soon discovers crop circles in the farm's corn fields. Could they be signs of an alien invasion, or just an elaborate prank played by people with too much time on their hands?M. Night Shyamalan proves yet again that he's a very gifted director. (Although some call him the next Spielberg, I consider him to be the next Robert Zemeckis, as he utilizes more subtle special effects rather than the in-your-face eye-candy sort.) Previously helming ""Unbreakable,"" and before that, ""The Sixth Sense,"" M. Night takes elements from both of those movies to create ""Signs."" He successfully utilizes the frightening and intense moments borrowed from ""The Sixth Sense,"" as well as the simple, yet somehow, fancy camerawork from ""Unbreakable.""Mel Gibson gives a solid performance as the widower who loses his faith over the death of his wife. He acts as if he desperately cares for his kids, and even his brother. Although some may disagree, I believe Gibson yet again gives an Oscar-worthy performance. As for Joaquin Phoenix, he acts like a second father to Graham's children, who give a stunning performance, as well.Although some believed that ""Signs"" would be a typical invasion movie and special effects extravaganza, I found it to be something more than that. It's about faith, and the film constantly asks us questions, such as: Are there miracles in the world, or is it just luck? Shyamalan directs and writes ""Signs"" with such intelligence that many will think that it was slow and needed to be cut down a bit. I don't believe this; if you are following along with the story, you'll see that almost every scene is needed somehow in the movie.As a special-effects movie freak, I could say that ""Signs,"" which does in fact have some special effects, intelligently provides us with a more subtle view that focuses more on the characters rather than what's going on outside. (There is very little second unit photography in this film.) Most of the effects will go unnoticed, and what this says is that the special effects team has done their job.""Signs"" is yet again a unique piece of art by M. Night Shyamalan. Though it's more predictable than the director's previous movies, it's still very entertaining, and often frightening at times. Shyamalan knows how to make a movie that literally forces you to care about the characters, and not the eye candy. I can't wait to hear what M. Night's up to next.",Signs

550,williamknott,"The ""Message"" is Besides the Point",8,5 August 2002,"WARNING:  CONTAINS SPOILERSThis was the first time in a long time I was completely hooked (99% hooked) into everything a movie was about. I must have been in the right mood for it, and I'm glad I was, because I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, right to the very end.When the girl was trying to give the dog some water, and the dog barked, I jumped.When the guy was watching the video tape of the kid's birthday party, saying, ""Hey, little kids, get out of the way,"" I was saying it with him, because I wanted to see what was on the tape. I was reaching over my seat trying to get a closer look to make sure I didn't miss anything, scanning through those bushes trying to figure out what the hell they were looking at. And then when I saw that flash of the alien on the video, I flipped. Totally creeped me out.The sound of the aliens on the roof creeped me out.  ALL the sounds the movie creeped me out.When Mel Gibson cut the alien's fingers off in the pantry, I was ready to hide behind my pillow (if I had a pillow)--but I couldn't look away. The tension gradually built up for me as the movie progressed, and there was a point where the tension was so high I almost wanted to leave the theatre. The movie worked on me big time.The news broadcasts made it too much like ""War of the Worlds,"" but by that time I was too involved with everything to cast off my disbelief. Even the flashbacks of Mel Gibson's wife getting killed worked for me.At no point was I saying, ""Okay, this is stupid"" (like I did a thousand times over in ""Minority Report""). I went along with all of it, the EXPERIENCE of it all. I don't think I've ever felt more tension watching a movie. By the time I got to the end, I still felt tense; I kept looking around every corner, because I knew something was going to come out of the shadows, but I didn't know what. That's what really kept me involved with the whole thing, not knowing what I was going to see next or what was going to happen.At the end, when I saw the reflection of the alien in the tv screen, I thought I was going to have a stroke; I wanted to run. And then when I saw the alien holding the kid in his arms, I was in horror. It didn't seem lame, or silly or B-movieish or any of that. I was totally there, in the room with them, frozen, staring at that creepy-looking alien. Totally horrified.By this time, I didn't care how it ended; I just wanted it to end because the tension was too much to take.The ""faith"" message of the movie, I could take it or leave it. There really wasn't much to it, but I didn't care. I walked out of that movie feeling like I had shared in the experience of the characters, that I was there feeling it all with them. The faith message was weak, but how creeped out and terrified they were by the whole experience, I was with them, taking it all in at FACE VALUE by the time I got to the end. That's why the alien at the end horrified me, because to me it wasn't a guy in a rubber suit. That F*%&*ing thing was real. I wanted to get the hell out of there. I didn't want to try communicating in sign language or say, ""I come in peace."" That was one mean motherf*&^%!ing looking alien, and I didn't want to stick around and make friends. I wanted to grab that kid and run like hell. But the alien was holding the kid--couldn't run. That moment of unbearable indecision was stretched out forever, and, again, I was there. The tension was too much to take.And like said, I didn't care what happened after that. I just wanted the tension to end. Could have ended with a song and dance number and that would have been okay with me. I just needed relief.Except for the faith message, the EXPERIENCE of the movie worked 100% on me. I can't remember the last time this happened to me in a movie. Maybe this makes me a sucker, that I could be completely engrossed by such a contrived film, but all films are contrived; enjoying them is partially a matter of suspending your disbelief. And I guess I was primed to do just that. Must have been in the right mood. And I'm glad, because it was the most satisfying experience I've had at the movies in the past couple years.I remember people talking about how ""The Blair Witch Project"" totally horrified them--and how I thought it was a waste of time. That's because right from the beginning I didn't believe any of it. I knew it was fake and didn't feel at all involved with it. For some people, ""Signs"" will be the same--if they don't believe what's going on right from the start, the rest of the movie will probably seem silly. This time for me, however, it was different, and I'm glad, even if it does mean I'm just another sucker. It was SO COOL to look at the alien and react to it as if it were real, to believe it. That was the best.Arguments over whether or not ""God"" sent the aliens are secondary, if not irrelevant, to the visceral experience of the film.",Signs
551,vladthelad8666,Near perfect movie.,10,30 March 2020,"Signs may not be considered a cult classic to many, but it's one of the more unique movies released in the early 2000's. The premise really is a pharadox, because it shows a man and his broken family struggle with faith and reconnecting, amidst a mass alien invasion. It really is one of, if not the best movie M Night has created in my own humble opinion.The best thing about this movie is without a doubt the cast, Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin did a fantastic job portraying their very different characters. Everyone has a different personality trait, that sets them apart from each other, but close enough to be a belieavable family.If you think, that this will be another one of those alien movies, you'd be very mistaken. It's a fascinating personal story being told, while the world around them has changed in a heartbeat and challenges them to face their fears and regrets.It's a movie that I will always recommend, regardless if you are a fan of the sci-fi, thriller or drama genre, anyone can enjoy this masterpiece of storytelling.",Signs
552,ObsessiveViewer,M. Night Shyamalan is a genius!,9,23 July 2004,"*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuyM. Night Shyamalan is a genius storyteller and filmmaker. It is as simply put as that. His third commercial film is his greatest acheivement since Unbreakable. Signs is not an alien invasion movie. It is the story of a man who, after a tragic event, loses his faith in God and, following a worldwide event, regains it. Signs is the type of film that is scary the first time around and fun to watch the second and third. It's fun to see how Night set us up for the climax of the film by including a lot of exposition throughout the rest of it. Shyamalan brings back the atmospheric creepiness from The Sixth Sense and adds quite a bit of comic relief that was absent in his previous work. Mel Gibson's work as Graham Hess, a widowed former reverend and father of two young children, is fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix is very impressive as Graham's younger brother, and former minor league baseball player, Merrill. Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin are Bo and Morgan Hess in the film. Both children are terrific and, along with Phoenix, provide most of the comic relief.
Night's trademark slow pacing is still present in this film although not as much as in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. The pacing fits the story to a tee and helps create and build the tension towards the true nature of the crop circles in the film. James Newton Howard provides another brilliant score and enhances the experience considerably. His music is not as explosive as it was for me in Unbreakable but it was brilliant nonetheless.
Overall this is M. Night Shyamalan's strongest film. I do not consider it the masterpiece that I felt The Sixth Sense was, I was just more drawn to the story this time around. If you are a fan of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, then you will not be disappointed by Signs. It is surely a ***** film and is highly recommended.",Signs
553,tsheridan94,"Not as good as Sixth Sense, but...",4,6 February 2010,"...Still a very good movie. I am a firm believer in the fact that M. Night Shyamalan is a fantastic director who has taken on some very, very bad movies. This was one of the last movies he made before he started to go downhill.While not incredibly scary, this movie still provides a couple jump moments, most of which come in the basement scene.The story itself is set up very nicely. While it is much more predictable than The Sixth Sense, I still loved the way Shyamalan initiates the story, daring the viewer to come and watch. Those crop circles in the corn are pretty ominous. And in addition it has Abigail Breslin, whom I've come to the conclusion is the child version of Cate Blanchett-someone who can play any role they're given, and play it well. And she was like five years old when this was being filmed. I hope Breslin stays around for a long time.And Mel Gibson ain't too bad, himself. Before he got, allegedly, really anti-Semitic, he was a very talented actor. This isn't is best work (I'll reserve that honor for Braveheart), but it is still a decent performance.The thing I enjoyed most about the movie, though, was not the plot, the characters, or the few and far between scares. It was how real of a family the Hesses seemed to be. They are not romanticized in any way. There is anger and tension, but also love and caring. With the trajectory of his career going the way it is, I doubt that Shyamalan will ever again reach the heights he did with The Sixth Sense. This leaves to hope that the highest he might be able to go is back up to the level of Signs. And this is a great movie. Maybe after he finishes the Last Airbender, Shyamalan will return to the reason I, and Im sure a lot of others, love him. For the suspense, the intrigue. He tells a good tale. We can only hope he hasn't forgotten how.",Signs

Let's just say I have a whole bunch of issues with this movie.1)The entire thing was an overlong second rate version of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.2)Those were real birds and they're still terrifying, which is a lot more than I can say for some idiot in a bright green Halloween costume.3)Why would the aliens, with all their brilliance that enables them to travel galaxies, try to conquer a planet that's 65% covered by the substance that kills them! Some people have tried using the defense that it's holy water, but that doesn't explain why Dr. Reddy thought they were afraid of the lake. This is just a huge plot hole. What's with Shyamalan's water phobia? I thought that was OK as David Dunne's weak point, but why would he use the same thing twice? It didn't make sense here.4) That whole ""swing away"" twist. I'm sorry, I have nothing to say about that other than I thought it was COMPLETELY RETARDED! 5)The ending was much too heavy handed.

The average persons perspective and what they go through.  M.

557,bhcpc,Overhyped mediocre movie -- insult to viewers' intelligence,4,17 November 2002,"Signs turns out to be a big disappointment to me. As a sci-fi alien invasion movie, it's full of clichés and plot holes. Even the religion/faith theme is weak and unconvincing; basically Hess lost his faith when his wife died in a freak accident and regained it when his son lived due to a freakish sequence. All the atmospheric, flowery shots by the director cannot hide the turns of events are forced and simplistic. A much more powerful way would be he regains this faith YET his son DIED; something obviously the director/writer had no stomach for it as he went for the Hollywood style redemption.The biggest disappointment is the alien. *****Spoiler Ahead*****These aliens were supposed to be smart, fast and with technology light-years ahead of us. Instead, we were asked to believe some plastic-skin zombie possessing little intelligence, little athletic ability, nothing but primitive poison gas as weapon, not to mention problems with water and wood, to be THE MENACE. The whole ""Merrill swing away"" sequence is simply ridiculous and outrageous -- an insult to everyone's intelligence.",Signs

This is a charmless, stinking turd that will be bettered than the popcorn sat under a heat-light for the past 24 hours even with flies buzzing over it.The premise begins with a disillusioned, racist preacher played by Mel Gibson, he hates the Jews and so he's settled in the rural heartlands of America to restart a master-race, unfortunately he has a son with a cleft-palate and he also has a dead wife, so him and god aren't on good terms anymore... It's OK though Jesus sends some aliens to test his faith and guess what, he gets his faith back and it's all OK! Only it isn't. M Knight Shtmalan(sic), is possibly one of the most horrificly insulting people I've ever come across in films, possibly even worse than Michael Winner... this movie treats the audience like they're retarded.In all truthfullness, I saw 6th Sense and was truly angered by the banality of that movie and I bought this from a charity shop on VHS (back in the day), this is also the one and only movie I have ever thrown out - ever, even Magnolia escaped that. Yet, so awful that I taped over it with a documentary just in case anyone found this at the rubbish tip and decided they might want to watch it - I spared them that.I really detest the whole Michael Bay kinda thing, yet find that sometimes watchable with enough booze, this doesn't even have the charm of exploding things, just a seemingly willfully-dull plot, that treats you as if you are very, very stupid.",Signs

IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE AN ALIEN INVASION FILM.A lot of people did not like that the Aliens were hurt by water,a nd were complaining: 'Oh, but they cant take over a planet filled with water because water hurts them!'Okay, I have a couple things to say to that. THEY WERE NOT TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE PLANET! If you had listened to the film, you would have found out that they were there for the people, not the planet, dips*its. Even if they were here for the planet it would make sense.

Night might possibly be the new Hitchcock for thrillers. This film is brilliant and one of my favorite Gibson movies. It's very different from most thrillers. It's not all blood and gore and violence, so maybe that's why some people hate it? I still can't imagine why so many love movies like Saw but hates Signs. Signs is slow paced, yes, but that is what makes is different from the other thrillers. It doesn't show you the aliens right away. It leaves you guessing on what's happening other places, something that Cloeverfield tried to do recently with the monster in the city-but I think kind of failed. M. Nigh succeeds, though, in setting a spooky theme and the ending is great. The acting is superb and the writing is fantastic but the directing is what makes this film special. With any other director, other than Spielberg, this film might have been ruined the visual masterpiece. Seriously people, watch it again if you've already seen it, and try and see it in a new light. This is a brilliant Hollywood thriller. One that they don't make very often and one that is to be treasured.",Signs
563,JJBrent,"A spellbinding, funny and tragic film.",8,30 July 2002,"There are few directors that I will go out and see a movie just because they directed it, regardless of the subject matter or who's in it. M. Night is now on my list. Movies can be picked apart on so many levels, even the greatest ones (Citizen Kane, Ben-Hur, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest etc...) I avoid second guessing anyone's work. So, dismiss the naysayers who didn't like this film. here's what I thought:Signs is in my top 5 of 2002. For a couple of hours, I visited a farm in Pennsylvania. I got to know a wonderful family. I laughed with them, got scared with them and even cried. SIGNS is indeed NOT the movie that the trailers portray. It's better. *******Possible spoilers follow********** I'll do my best not to reveal key plot points or surprises.
In SIGNS, you get to know Graham hess, a former reverend who lost his faith in God after a terrible tragedy. He lives on a farm with his brother and his two children. A large crop circle is discovered on the farm's property. Confused, the police are contacted. It is deemed a prank until hundreds more are discovered all around the world. The most successful execution of the entire film is that it is told completely from the view of the family and through television and radio broadcasts, exactly the way we might all experience the same thing. I was reminded of my morning watching the September 11th attacks on the news several times during the film especially as Joaquin Phoenix sees footage from Brazil where ""something"" was caught on tape. His reaction of horror was astounding. IMDB doesn't allow me enough room to put all of my feelings down. I've really only just begun to touch on my review, but, let me at least get these points out: Mel Gibson is a phenominal actor with unending passion. Joaquin Phoenix has put in his best performance to date. His character is a real, living, breathing human being. Rory Culkin is destined to be the first Culkin in history to maintain a career in acting and little Abigail Breslin is a charm and beats out Drew Barrymore's E.T. performance 100 fold.
M. Night, you are a fantastic storyteller. Directing a film is obviously not a job for you but a passionate means of telling great tales and drawing people into your world. Keep on making YOUR movies. If I could one day realize my dream of making movies, I'd want to make films like this.
SIGNS is a PERFECT film.",Signs
564,baodawao,A unique movie,9,8 August 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favourite directors. That because he makes his movies in an unique style. Signs is his first film after the smash-hits The sixth sense and Unbreakable. Evey movie he makes is good, and this is not a exception. The movie is about a preacher named Graham Hess who has lost his wife. He live on a farm with his two kids and his brother Meryll (Joaquin Phoenix).One morning Graham finds a massive crop circle in his back yard. Graham thinks it's jokers fooling around, but when they begin to occur all around the world, he soon finds out that the planet are been invaded by aliens. Night focus more on the scares and suspense rather on the action. And thats not a bad thing. Everything in this movie is perfect. The soundtrack is beautifully composed by James Newton Howard (King Kong, The village). M. Night Shyamalan produced, directed, starred and wrote this peace of art. Signs is truly a work of art, and i recommend it for those who are a big Shyamalan fan or just love good movies.",Signs
565,Confidante77,Good... but not in the way you might expect,6,21 January 2007,"The first M. Night Shyamalan picture I saw was ""the sixth sense"", it was excellently directed and managed to be scary using both strong visual images, psychological horror and of course, a great twist.when it came to watching this, I was hoping for more of the same, however I must say that this is a league away from the Sixth sense, but not necessarily in a bad way. The film kind of feels like a mainstream scary movie, and as a result of this isn't actually scary at all (the part with the alien holding the kid was just laughable), however Shyamalan makes the story compelling and there are several moments of tension, for example when Mel Gibson is in the crop field or when the family are arguing at dinner.It's although worth mentioning that the movie is quite funny at times, for example Joaquin Phoenix explaining (his delivery of this line is great) that ""crop circles are made by a bunch of geeky guys with no girlfriends and too much spare time"".Overall, it's relatively entertaining and probably worth seeing, just don't expect anything earth shattering",Signs
566,UltramarineX,M. Night Shyamalan does it again,9,2 August 2002,"**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were both truly unique pieces of filmmaking, so when I went to go see Shyamalan's latest flick I had fairly high expectations, and boy I was not disappointed. Signs is quite possibly one of the best movies of the year.Signs is about a reverend who has lost his faith after the death of his wife. One day his family discovers a mysterious crop circle in their backyard. Throughout the movie Shyamalan drops little, delicious breadcrumbs of information which signifies that something major is going to take place, and I gobbled up each bit like sweet candy.The acting by everyone in this film was superb, especially Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. What I loved about this movie was the sense of shear dread that the movie creates, and it goes to show that it is not seeing an oozing, bloody monster that makes a movie ""scary"", but rather it's the thought of it.My only qualms with the movie are its last 15 minutes. Without revealing what happened, let's just say it felt a little out of place with the tone of the rest of the movie. Also, at times the movie can get a little melodramatic.  But, despite that, Signs is a true marvel of a movie, and I encourage everyone to go see it. If M. Night Shyamalan continues making more movies like this, he definitely has a bright future ahead of him.I rate this film 9/10.",Signs
567,oparthenon,A film about the signs of faith that can heal a family's wounds,9,19 March 2010,"With more than 2000 IMDb viewers' responses, Signs certainly seems to have stirred up film watchers' imaginations. My comment here will be brief because I don't want to add to the general mayhem the movie seems to have generated; but having read even a few opinions, I am convinced some things need to be cleared up.First, Shaymalan, like Spielberg (and many other Hollywood directors who don't admit it,) is by his own description a B movie director; he makes no pretensions towards creating art, except for the masses. Viewers should not necessarily expect subtlety or technical brilliance in films intended to provide large audiences with a campy version of horror. Viewers can enjoy Shaymalan's films for their eccentric views of horror or special effects, films strong on mood and atmosphere but not necessarily on plot or character.Signs, however, surpasses these limitations, and is clearly the director's best effort so far -- despite himself, he has made a good film. No need to mention the masterful building of suspense that he achieves here -- even the film's critics acknowledge it. And the moment much-talked-about -- the ""Brazilian video"" birthday party -- will scare you indeed. Small children may indeed be terrified. I am not a small child, and I was.To view this film with some objectivity, ask yourself not what you as a viewer look for in a film, but what the director intended to achieve in it. A so-called lack of plausibility, for instance (understood as a lack of 'believable plot') actually has the purpose of deflecting us from the real horror of the characters' lives: their inability to come to terms with the death of their mother and spouse. Whether or not an alien race would evolve enough technology to travel through space but not enough to break out of a locked room is irrelevant to the sense of terror that our awareness that there is an alien in that locked room actually causes. Clearly the film is not 'about' an alien invasion or some other preposterous nonsense, but about this family, torn apart by guilt and grief over the death of the mother, and how one singular experience -- I will not reveal it in case there may be someone out there who has yet to see the film, but it involves being locked in a cellar -- changes their lives by bringing them face to face with the unaccountable and mysterious gift that life is -- and that sharing this gift amongst the living demands the defence of the living, and requires sacrifice to protect them -- far worthier than wasting one's life in the doubt and despair that the death of a loved one can cause.Shyalaman thus raises the question of faith and the value, indeed the need, of hope. Family is worth protecting; those we love are worth our sacrifice in defending them. That is the purpose of using the 'macguffin' device of the crop destruction (as this is a basic plot line I do not believe mentioning it counts as a spoiler) for this is what sets in motion the long string of events that ends up bringing the family to its epiphany, or moment of revelation.I find it odd, really, that so many viewers seem to think that only 'pure' horror (which I suspect means gory or bloody) or 'pure' science fiction (which I suspect means science fantasy, as one might find it in Lynch's Dune or one of the Star Wars films) can guarantee a stylish, satisfying entertainment. Cearly films like these can offer an exciting escape from boredom. Signs, on the other hand, eschews the sensationalism of science fiction to focus on what actions are necessary in life to maintain faith and love in a world increasingly disoriented, violent, and destructive.",Signs

But I would expect nothing less in an M Night Shyamalan movie starring two great actors.  The story is basic, but the way that Shyamalan tells it is incredible.

574,juliomontoya2000,Some problems...,5,9 September 2002,"I think the movie has some serious flaws that affect the final product all around. One thing that bothered me the most was the children. Malcom, the son, sometimes looks very smart, over average, but sometimes looks like a fool. In the end, I can't say if he's a genius or just an average little boy, because the script drags him from one extreme to the other. And Bo...well, if I have to define that character, is more like a crazy child, a mad little girl. But in fact, we don't know if she's crazy, or just her childish imagination, playing tricks on her. Her line, that has been part of the trailer, in which she speaks to her father, in serious tone: `There's a monster outside my room...can I have a glass of water?' represents the major problem with her. We don't know if she's joking, or if she's serious. In that line, she looks to be mad, or possessed, and that's the way she goes through the movie, without a real explanation or justification, just to fulfill the roll of another `sign'. Those are problems with the script, not the acting, which by the way I think is good. And the jokes...there are far too many jokes or ""funny"" situations in this movie, that not always work well or are funny enough. Sometimes they're just plain silly. In `The Sixth Sense', the most renowned movie of the `Signs' director, the jokes were adequate, in perfect balance with the rest of the movie. Here, they really endanger the seriousness of the movie and the topic it deals with... Which, in the end, is the question of faith. That's the most interesting point of the movie. It's not a movie about aliens, is about one person's faith, the lose and the recovery. But, as interesting as this may seem, there lies the final flaw of this movie. If I loose my faith, the message of this movie is that I would need the kind of happenings, coincidences, better yet, miracles, like the movie presents, to get my faith back again. And that, for me, is a very hopeless thought. And that would be the same for anybody...except if they believe in miracles, indeed. 6/10",Signs
575,kebman,A good bad story,5,21 September 2002,"When I first saw The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan 1999) I was in awe. ""You've got to add a few twists and turns,"" I think the little kid Cole (Haley Joel Osment) said. Well, sadly that's what's lacking in Signs. It begins very well, though. All in all it's extremely exiting, funny and not to mention down right scary. There's some good acting too. That man does magic with kids. So, there is no doubt that Mr. Shyamalan has gotten much better at calculating story effect and to execute it on the screen. In that respect it is a powerfully entertaining film. In fact it's so well done, technically speaking, that it almost makes up for the extremely closed up Hollywood-happy-ending. I suppose it isn't a spoiler to reveal that yes, it has a happy ending. There's nothing wrong in that either! The Sixth Sense had a happy ending as well, but the big difference is that Sixth Sense wasn't a cliché. Or maybe, after seeing that already classic film, and the lesser but still very good Unbreakable; is it that I just have too high expectations? In Signs he doesn't once dare to challenge the audience (other than scaring us a little of course, but that's expected of a thriller), and he takes that to the bitter end. Well, this is OK as long as you're just trying to entertain. But I don't think that's all Shyamalan is doing. He's throwing in a huge chunk of morale as well. He is trying to teach, which isn't a bad idea if you've got something new and important to tell. This however, wasn't terribly important, and not really new. So stop insulting my intelligence!

The plot was good, the tension and suspense built up as it should and the ending was unexpected. Then came ""Unbreakable"". I gave it a very low rating here, because the action was sooooo sloooow, there hardly was any tension and an unexpected ending lacked. Sadly in ""Signs"" Shyamalan follows his tradition of ""Unbreakable"". ""Signs"" lacks everything a good movie should have. If my wife had not wanted to continue, I would have switched it off halfway. Hardly anything happens, and the events that do happen are far from unexpected. No tension at all is being built up. One knows from the very start that the events have something to do with some kind of extra terrestrial life, and this suggestion is repeated so often that extreme boredom overcomes the viewer. It is clear that we get to see something of these ET's at some point, but when this happens at last there is no tension, no horror, no unexpected action, no drama, nothing at all that can grip the viewer. The (few) principal characters react frightened from the start to the end but what are they frightened of? And what is the plot? I don't know. There is no plot. So this was the last movie I ever saw by Shyamalan. He made one great movie (""The Sixth Sense"") but he seems not to be able to reproduce even some of the fine elements of that one.",Signs

The scary corn field, the quick glimpses of our alien visitors, the spooky sound effects, the lights going out at just the right moment...all guaranteed to make you spill a little popcorn. And there are some genuinely funny scenes, too. However, M.N.S's script and direction are so slow and ponderous between these high points as to make one feel sleepy and bored.  Watching Mel Gibson trying to act out a crisis of personal faith is like watching paint dry.  This has to be his dullest performance to date.  The rest of the cast is good (check out the creepy performance by the actor playing the recruiting officer talking to Joaquin Phoenix) but the words they are given to speak never sound natural or real.

586,lemasque,Just like War of the Worlds,1,5 October 2002,"In the movie Signs a character says, `Just like War of the Worlds.' Although he is talking about the unfolding events of the story, he might as well have been referring to the whole movie. Everything from Night of the Living Dead to The Wizard of OZ is fair game for M. Night Shyamalan's larceny. The whole ridiculously over-dramatized mess has no more substance than an episode of The Outer Limits.And then there is Mr. Shyamalan's acting. Although not quite as embarrassing or self-serving as your typical Quentin Tarantino cameo, the performance is even less credible. Of course, this might be the result of poor direction, which is undoubtedly the case with Mel Gibson. His super stoic portrayal of the protagonist is really a boredom endurance test. And Rory Culkin as his son Morgan is simply just a weak incarnation of another Sixth Sense youngster, but infinitely more nauseating.WARNING: SOME OF THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER!Yet, nothing compares to the limp-wrist, semi-naked aliens. These obviously computer-generated bogeymen are not even smart enough to wear protective clothing, control inferior beings, or even escape from a blocked kitchen pantry. They seem to have no weapons. Nor do their intended victims, the inhabitants of a lone farmhouse in the middle of a cornfield, in the middle of nowhere. Maybe they all are just trying to be politically correct. How did these aliens ever manage to travel several light years through space and arrive at Earth?And I'm not even going to touch the advice giving, clairvoyant wife crushed against a tree.

587,fiona-21,"It doesn't HAVE to all make sense, people.",7,12 March 2003,"!!!!!!!!!!  CONTAINS SPOILERS  !!!!!!
Okay, I've read a lot of criticism about this film but I have to defend it.If anyone has read 'Tommyknockers' by Stephen King they will be aware of the stupid alien theory. Okay they can travel to earth but maybe they didn't invent interstellar travel, they could have poached it form some other nearby species or inherited it from a previously enlightened culture on their own planet ( I mean, when the ancient Egyptians were building pyramids , some cultures were still living in caves in other parts of the world ). If they were that smart they would have been far more subtle and used more insidious ways to get what they wanted rather than the very clumsy methods they did use. They had no obvious weapons (except their poison gas spray) and seemed to be unable to cope with a locked door barring their way!! Also they struck me as rather insectile - quite organised but not too able to think creatively, even their speech sounded like crickets or something.As for the water thing - maybe they didn't KNOW that water was toxic to them. Perhaps earth was the first planet they ever visited that HAD water. And if they they subsequently realised after landing that water could harm them, then maybe they had a sort of stubborn attitude to the idea of giving up and going home after travelling all that way in the first place. Lets face it, everyone knows that smoking gives you cancer but how many people keep smoking anyway and think 'it won't happen to me'.Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix were excellent and the film had some quite subtle humour and nice touches like the recruiting office scene where JP gets a hard time from local idiot Lionel Pritchard and then there's a tiny moment where you get to see that Pritchard is a total loser. I liked the fact that Mel Gibson didn't seem to own any guns - being an ex-reverend and everything, and the cursing scene was funny too.I don't think films should necessarily give you nice neat endings and answer all your questions. I think that M Night Shayamalan would be pleased to see how many people are outraged by the loose ends, I'm sure it's exactly what he would have wanted to see.",Signs

Everything about this movie is subtle; the lighting, the acting, the special effects and most importantly the HORROR.  I avoided every commercial, review and preview for this movie and it paid off. Mel Gibson is a farmer with kids and crop circles, was all I knew and all I wanted to know. This movie is terrifying.  Shyamalan has become a master of tension.  He creates great characters, blends mystery, with horror, warm and humor like he has been make movies all his life (he has by the way).If you like Hitchcock, if you like the X-files, or if you just like agood scare, you will love this movie.**see the movie then come back and read this last part...What I love about Shyamalan's films is that all three major releases, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs, are total fiction; a ghost story, a comic book and alien sci-fi.  But he handles them with such plausibility that they we connect effortlessly to them and are touched by them.  Whether the emotion be fear or sympathy we feel for these sci-fi characters, because they act like real people.  We let them get to us faster.  After you get past the shock of the twisted endings, the films take on a new feel.  Signs is what would ACTUALLY happen if alien landed in your backyard.  No laser blasters, no fast acting military, no scientist or flashing ships.  A family barricaded in their house watching the news.  Someone I saw this film with complained that all they did was watch tv in the movie.  Well I think we all remember sept 11th, what happened... we all planted ourselves down and watching thinks unfold on a small screen.  Shyamalan's three films are fantastical, but grounded in reality.  Because of this, things like swings, end tables, dogs barking and train stations, things familiar to our everyday, have the power to thrill or terrify us. I hope M. Night is around for a very long time.Go see Sign.",Signs

The mike has been dangling all through the whole picture. It just destroyed the whole scenery. Perhaps, it will win the Oscar for the ""Best Supporting Actor"". But regardless to this really BIG goof (Am I the only one noticing that?), I can only recommend this film to all of those out there who like their X-Files-style-pics with a litte bit ""drama"". What annoyed me a bit was the religious aspect. It is obvious from the first ten minutes on, that Mel will find his believe and will be priest again. Isn't it?

If you happen to come across this movie in a rental store and your looking for some good clean scares i say rent it but be ready for that vile ending.

It's bad enough that it includes as a fundamental story element CROP CIRCLES, the quintessential hoax in which people to this day still choose to believe (despite the original hoaxers' ""coming out"" years ago). The formulaic threads are nearly sickening. The religious man who, thanks to some tragedy, turns his back on god, but by the end of the movie realizes the ""truth"" of his restored faith, tying a pretty bow around the tidy happy ending.

594,loopydate,How did I go so long without seeing this?,10,16 September 2002,"I've never been a fan of the horror genre.  I loathe movies like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Resident Evil"" or any of the other gut-'em style horror movies.That said, there are a few movies in the genre that I've really enjoyed. Most were made back in the black-and-white era, when they didn't have the technical ability to show someone being gutted, so they had to insinuate it through unusual camera angles and quick cuts.  Films like ""Psycho,"" ""The Birds,"" and even the original version of ""The Haunting,"" while tame by today's standards were always able to frighten me more than Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhies, the Candyman, or any of their ilk.Sadly, with the exception of a couple of movies in the '80s (i.e. ""Jaws,"" but I'd really categorize that as more of an action/suspense movie than ""horror""), there had not been a good horror movie made in Hollywood until M. Night Shyamalan gave us ""The Sixth Sense"" in the late 1990s.So, when the trailers for ""Signs"" began showing up during the spring movie season of this year, a part of me was very excited by it.  Shyamalan had wowed me before, could he do it again?  I had stayed away from ""Unbreakable,"" because I'd heard it was awful, and I wanted to keep Shyamalan on a pedestal as one of those writers/directors who ""got it.""But, being a cynical non-horror fan, I stayed away from ""Signs.""  I subjected myself to HORRIBLE ""films"" like ""XXX"" and upper-mediocre movies like ""Swimfan"" and ""Simone,"" but I never got into a theater to watch Mel, Joaquin, and the gang.Yesterday, as I'm driving home, I get a phone call from a friend, telling me that the local theater and a local radio station are teaming up for a special ""Signs"" screening that was only going to cost something like $1.50 per ticket.  I figure, sure, why not?  If I walk out in disgust, it's not like I paid the full $5, right?The film was riveting.  I could not tear my eyes away from the screen, save to occasionally steal a glance at the girl I came with (who had seen it something like 6-8 times before) to try to gauge her reactions so I'd know when to brace myself for the next ""OMIGOD!"" moment.But the film was more than just scary, though it was certainly that.  It was also one of the funniest films I've seen all year.  There have been a couple of good comedies this year (""Goldmember"" and the underrated ""Death to Smoochy"" come immediately to mind), but I'd argue that ""Signs"" was funnier than any of them.The first time that ""someone"" arrives, the scene where Graham (Gibson) and Merrill (Phoenix) attempt to scare them off is absolutely hilarious, and just about any scene with the little girl was a riot.  Shyamalan did an amazing job of playing the horror and the comedy off of each other, lightening every moment of near-unbearable tension with the sight of Merrill and the kids wearing tin-foil hats so the aliens couldn't ""read their minds.""And, like in ""The Sixth Sense"" before it, Shyamalan brings together every detail (no matter how minute) from the entire story in the closing sequence, making every line of dialogue, every character quirk, every second of screen time important to the conclusion.I would be VERY surprised with myself if I don't get back out to see this movie at least once more before it leaves theaters.  And, yes, I'll pay full price this time.",Signs
595,GroggyLane,Shyamalan ruins a potential clessic in the end..,6,27 January 2005,"I think that editors are a good thing. When writers and directors are new and lacking in success, a good editor can build on great inspiration and make a story something truly special. The problems start when a writer or director becomes famous. Either they become too powerful to allow those necessary little tweaks, or no one has the guts to even suggest them anymore. Well, I'm no writer! That much is plain to anyone reading this. However, I also have no reason to fear M. Night Shyamalan. He could probably take me in a street fight, but the chances of that ever happening are pretty slim. I run too fast! So here goes... I thought Signs was a good movie. I thought it could have been a great movie. The build up of suspense was there. The story kept viewers interested. We liked and cared about the characters. But the cheesy aliens buried it. Was this movie actually made in the 70's and left in the can for 30 years? I felt that the build up was leaving the audience guessing if there really was an invasion at all. Was it all just a hoax, or some unexplainable phenomenon? That uncertainty was the best part of the movie and if we had been left with that, I'm sure some would have cried ""Rip Off!"", but I also believe that this film would have been hailed rather than panned..",Signs

We have come to expect a surprise twist at the end of any of this director's films and this one was quite a let down.

To wit: In both movies, they find mysterious .. well... signs. IN CEot3K, its tones. In signs, crop circles.Both movies point to the discovered elements as ""navigation systems"" (The tones in CE3K turn out to be latitudes and longitudes, in Signs, a system that points to major cities) The basement sequence in Signs has the same feel as the kidnapping sequence in CEot3K Both have a sequence in India in which the locals discover the signals.I was thinking these were similar movies, about making contact with aliens. One film they are good, in this one evil.Until the end of Signs threw a curveball at me. Let's just say that in Signs, the title Isn't referring to the crop circles.

So I won't spoil anything for you guys I'll just say that the plot is great the dialogs are awesome and of cause it has a twist. Oh you Night. So that's that now to acting. Mel Gibson (yeah the guy who promised to kill his girlfriend) plays great I loved him. The guy from Gladiator is good and the kids are decent. The soundtrack is bad-ass if anything I would love that movie just for that. Although I love it for a different thing - the atmosphere. Yes it's really cool. There're scary moments where you go - d...m what a f...g s...t just happened and it's great.

I thought it was a very interesting study of a Pennsylvania farm family encountering the mystery behind the circle formations in their cornfields.  The casting of Mel Gibson and company was perfect.  The director used the minimalist approach to achieve maximum impact, with obvious homage to Hitchcock and Spielberg. Technical aspects of the movie, especially the sound editing, original score, cinematography, and film editing, were on target and may get Oscar nominations. Above all, the director's skill in combining horror, suspense, humor and hope is amazing.  My only wish is that after ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and now ""Signs,"" Mr. Shyamalan will now turn his attention toward material not dealing with the supernatural for a change. Variety is the spice of life, and I feel that M.

Also, the direction was derivative and simply ripped-off from other films.Besides that, the screenplay is nonsensical, filled with inconsistencies, and is just illogical in so many ways. These have been described at length and in detail in the reviews and on the IMDB ""Signs"" message board. Read them. The only question is who was dumber - the aliens or the humans.
But then an interesting phenomenon occurs. We see fanatical and sycophantic comments from a hardcore cadre of people who are in fact pseudo-intellectuals who think only they can fully comprehend what M. Night Shyamalan was trying to do. It appears to make them think they are smarter than they are by imagining they have unique (but in reality false) insights into this movie.The reality is that ""Signs"" is a superficial and manipulative movie that is also highly pretentious intellectually.

It's it's on thing, the cinematography is perfect, the characters and casting is perfect and a simple fact for me when I find myself watching the same movie again once or twice a year is that's the purest form of good story telling.

Sure, the reviews weren't as grand as those of M.Nights previous works...but the same could be said of most directors...the George Lucas sagas, Francis Ford Coppola's ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" as opposed to his ""Godfather"" movies. Like everything in this big world, success and failure are cyclical. With regards to profits? well, it has made back its investment many times over...can the same be said for ""Matrix Revelations?""OK, now to brass taxes: This movie is great for several reason, not the least being that it does what it initially sets about to do...build suspense, create drama, and finally, crescendo and resolve. I suppose if there is a complaint, and this I will freely admit, it is that the plot threads at times take too long to develop. This has been a quibble with many of this directors films. It isn't necessarily a bad thing. With a movie such as ""The Sixth Sense"" the languid pace accentuated the thrill of discovery. But in ""Signs"" the slowness of development serves to hinder the overall feel of the film...which is to say that what should have been a very tense last half hour, gets sidetracked with explanation too often. That aside, however, I thought this movie was a near masterpiece of the genre. The web of characters are all drawn convincingly to a very satisfying conclusion. The movie is rich with convincing portrayals and though slow in developing, the plot elements are well thought out. I think that this film suffered from some questionable promotion...and that its audience was perhaps expecting something more fast paced and typically ""Hollywood"" in presentation. But that's OK, let those who expect the typical grumble about it...I am perfectly content enjoying something that uses style and cunning to build tension rather that an explosion every ten minutes ala Michael Bay.",Signs

So being an alien from somewhere out there, thinking the exact same thing, but still finds the question intriguing, and has the technology to satisfy this curiosity, should be so difficult to imagine. One day they find out they are not alone, and want to seek out these new creatures (from earth), yet to their greatest fear, they find out that 75% of that planet, which holds these new creatures, is made up of what kills them the most, water.So why did they come to earth? 1: We would try one way or the other to enter a planet, that harboured exterterrestial life, even if it meant exposing ourselves to a 75% acid atmosphere. I wouldnt do it, but your governtment might force their soldiers to do just so, even if it meant heavy casualties.So 1 there is the curiosity of these new creatures. 2: they wanted to free the last of the M-class planets (yeah i know), from the decease it beared, the human being. 3: Maybe the gas they had inside them was an excess supply of love, that they thought could help the human species better understand the universe. 4: Maybe it was communication. 5: Maybe they lived on earth in another timedimension, and thought, just as we would, that the earth was theirs.Whatever the reasons they came, its not the point of this beautiful movie. This movie is basicly about what makes us human; the need to reason every single move ever made in life. It is an overview of the first lingering steps of human evolution, into sentient beings. Building life up around illusions, is what spawns hope, not having an illusion spawns despair. Its all about reason. Doesnt matter what you base your reasons on, just as long as it makes sense to you.Having a reason, based on what you deeply think is truth, is touching reality.

607,overcaffeined,Close to the magic of old b/w sci-fi movies,8,12 May 2003,"This is a movie I enjoyed a lot. For a long time, we've missed the style of b/w sci-fi classic oldies, where claustrophobia, suspense, and thrilling sightings were basic ingredients. Signs recovers all this stuff. It's a new movie which recovers the classic magic of the oldies.It also provides an ""update"" to the genre: The characters watch the TV-news 24hrs/day, just like all of us did when recent terrorist and/or war acts happened. In fact, one of the brightest moments in the movie is indeed a TV news flash showing a home video.The plot has a strong structure. If you watch the movie several times, you'll realize all scenes come at the right time. Every scene is necessary (except for some too much scary moments, maybe).On the other hand, Signs has three things I didn't like:First of all, crop circles seem unnecessary in the movie. They're not really exploited in the plot (except for the title, maybe). I believe the movie would have been a lot better if it was based in, for example, mysterious UFO photographs rather than crop circles.Second, I think it's too scary in some moments, more than needed. I really loved the many thrilling sightings, but... most of them come after very frightening scenes, and it seems there's no need to scare the audience so much. You can show the same things and at the same time be suitable for a broader audience. It's not incompatible.Third, I believe the F/X art direction was not adequate. Technically it was very good, but the art/concept was not (ie: the things you see in the F/X lack the sci-fi atmosphere you'd expect, although they're technically very well done). This doesn't affect non-FX art direction: I believe art direction is satisfactory in non-FX scenes.Despite these three things, I really loved the movie. It's a movie I can watch again and again without getting bored. Is so exciting to re-discover the classic sci-fi magic!!I voted it as 8/10",Signs
608,flying-monkeys,Old-Fashioned Horror/Sci-Fi,8,1 September 2002,"First off, the anticipation for this movie was almost unbearable with trailers being shown something like three months before its release. I felt they really promoted the heck out of this movie, building it up like they did with Unbreakable, which in my opinion wasn't really that suspenseful of a movie but they were trying to ride the success of The Sixth Sense, and who wouldn't I guess. Anyway, I digress. ""Don't See It Alone"" was really the icing on the cake for me. That little tag line was like a magnet pulling me into the theater.Jackpot! M. Night Shyamalan has to be one of the most promising filmmakers of my time. Of course, my favorite genre is Horror/Suspense/Thriller so you can understand why I enjoy his work so much. With this movie he remembers the key to making a good scary movie: music, suspense and the ever elusive leaving things to the movie goers' imagination. He knows just what NOT to show to keep us on the edge of our seats, biting our nails. Plus he knows how to add humor to make you relax just enough to scare you even more in the next scene. You feel safe while you're laughing and he knows how to get you when you're feeling safe.I enjoyed the plot, the characters, and the overall film. The only complaint I would have (if I had to have one) is that Shyamalan messed up where a lot of other filmmakers mess up in a scary movie by showing a little too much. However, I am still extremely pleased with the movie and can't wait for Shyamalan to take me on my next ride of suspenseful intrigue and fear. Scary movies now stand a chance of being good again.",Signs
609,kaspen12,A brilliant thriller that falls apart at the two-thirds mark...,6,10 February 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan's third major picture is a tough film to review. The acting is great, the visuals get a thumbs up, and it's guided to its final destination by a deft filmmaker with a knack for creating suspense. Mel Gibson stars as former reverend Graham Hess, who has given up the faith after a freak accident takes his wife (ironic, as Gibson's next major film would be The Passion). Living on the family farm with his brother Merrill (the always excellent Joaquin Phoenix), they're scraping by and raising Graham's kids (Rory Culkin, the most talented of the Culkin clan, and Abigail Breslin). Unlike Harvery Keitel's character in From Dusk Till Dawn (""Do you still believe in God, Daddy?"" ""Yes. I'm just not happy with him."") however, Gibson's Hess has given up the faith completely. ""There's no one watching over us,"" he tells Merrill.Soon, crop circles are showing up in his cornfields. His animals are going haywire. We know what's coming next, but what works about the film is the sense of claustrophobia the setting creates. A massive invasion is being launched across the globe, and not once do we ever leave the perspective of the Hesses, in their small farmhouse entrenched by cornstalks. Shyamalan understands that an audiences imagination will always scare them more than anything concrete, and teases us with shadowy figures. It works. The first half of the film is beautifully suspenseful. The first straight on shot of an alien is pure goosebumps.And then things kind of fall apart. Actually seeing the aliens, they look a lot less intimidating than we previously imagined. The level of tension drops. It's not gone, but it's nowhere near intense. Then Shyamalan goes for one of his patented switch-endings, which worked so well The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Here, not so much. In a way, it's good storytelling in that the movie begins planting the seeds of its ending from the very beginning. In the end, the pieces are all in the rearview mirror and it is exciting to watch it come to fruition. The problem is a logistic one; it makes no sense. For aliens with such a weakness to even attempt an invasion of Earth seems downright hilarious. Still, while this stretch seems far-fetched, at least the movie works (for the most part). Unfortunately, we can't say the same for The Village. Good call, M. Night. Way to follow up a dud with a stinker.OVERALL SCORE: 7.0 = C+The score is inflated by an excellent first half and terrific acting that makes it worth watching. This is a movie that your senses will love, but your mind will reject. Still, if you can get past the ""twist"", you will have a good time. It's not nearly as good a film as the grossly underrated Unbreakable, but it is good. It just could have been great.PLEASE, M. NIGHT. NO MORE TWISTS!",Signs
610,whlwtcher,Don't believe the hype...,6,30 December 2002,"I wish I had taken that bit of advice before seeing this movie.  This movie was billed as the scariest movie you'll see all year...sorry, it wasn't. What is supposed to be the scariest parts in the film they showed in trailers on TV.  I was really disappointed in this film.  I adore Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix--both are truly gifted actors and they did well in this film, don't get me wrong but I was always waiting for the story to actually start!  When it finally did ten minutes later the credits are rolling.  It isn't a horrible film, there were some good parts but it definitely didn't live up to the hype.  It just wasn't that scary.  If you want scary or rather creepy, rent ""Night of the Living Dead"" and watch it with the lights out.  Now THAT'S creepy!",Signs
611,lovepade,Interesting but unsatisfying approach to religion,6,7 January 2003,"Signs is a good suspense movie. It works in a slow pace with the 'keep it simple stupid' motto. We hardly see the aliens, but they are constantly felt around the protagonist. It worked for Ridley Scott in `Aliens' and its working quite good for Shyamalan.(small spoilers - coming up)Mel Gibson's kids are scary as hell. They have lost their mother, and as the fargo-like policewoman says ` has gone through a lot'. Even considering that, they are still very `stiff' in their performance. However I think this was intended from the director's side, since it gives them an eerie radiance - almost as if them being kids makes them more susceptible to the alien's communication. Never the less - it doesn't seam realistic that kids should behave like that, not even if they were brought up the way they are (by a strict reverend).(Big spoilers coming up)Considering the genre, I very much like the idea that the aliens are not portrayed as the superior beings we are used to. Instead they are portrayed as being desperate and almost weak. That itself pulls my rating up, since it helps nuance the idea of extra terrestrial life.Also the revenge motive attributed to the alien scout that Gibson mutilates, gives the visitors a more `human' touch.However: The way that Gibsons character loses his belief doesn't convince me. And the whole idea about preordained destiny I loathe. The movie implies not only that Gibson lost his wife so that he later would save his son, but also that Phoenix baseball career had the same purpose (cf. scene in military office).The way the ending plays out shows such hesitation from all involved that one doubts it's realistic. However  - considering that the alien most likely was left behind, and the terror the humans are in - maybe.That the alien has poison coming out of its arms, does not imply hunting (as for instance a snake) but rather some form of bio-bodyarmour, which we cannot see.All these weaknesses can however also be attributed to the high amount of water in the atmosphere that maybe weakens them.The way human fear is portrayed is humorous, and a good reminder of our irrational approach to things. On the same account it gives the audiance a needed breather from the heavy / horror stuff.Because of the less than creditable account of a reverends faith and the fate/destiny theme, I was constantly annoyed. From that I give 6/10.However - If you are willing to buy that stuff, its at least 7, maybe 8/10.To pull the movie down because of unrealistic aliens, is to speculate about things we can't speculate about. We don't know were they came from or why, and we don't know how our atmosphere affects them. I think this is one of Shyamalans points, and also one of the prerequisites for watching any movie.So it all comes down to belief - not aliens!",Signs
612,altair42002,was this a ripoff,1,14 September 2007,"After watching this dreadful waste of film I felt like I had seen it before. After thinking about it for awhile, I realized that it was an almost exact copy of the 60's movie ""day of the triffids"". sure there are some differences, but if you watch the two together, there are so many similarities that it can't be just a coincidence. In triffids, the aliens are killed by water. same in this one. except for crop circles, and the fact that the aliens are humanoid instead of plants are the only real differences. If Mr. Shamalamadingdong wanted to create a scary film, he could have picked any other decent movie to ripoff instead of an old 60's piece of crap like TRIFFIDS.",Signs
613,Barry Lyndon-3,Is America Insane?,1,26 August 2002,"This was the epitome of Hollywood run amuck.  This was a very boring, very pretentious film.  I can not understand why American audiences are going to this film in droves.  This could have been a $1 million low-budget film. In fact, minus the huge salaries of Gibson, Night and the rest of the Above-the-line talent, it looks like that's all they spent.I felt watching this film that Night has started to believe his own hype that he's the next Speilberg.  This is not the same craftsman that made the wonderful ""6th Sense.""  It felt like he made decisions because he could, rather than what was best for the film.  Example: why bother bringing in the best VFX Producer in Hollywood (Erik Brevig) to design and supervise the alien when you never get to see the alien for more than seconds at a time? The same affect could have been done better and cheaper with a Stan Winston or Rik Baker monster creation.This is a tremendously disappointing effort.  I'm more disappointed in America for watching this crap than the filmmakers for making it.",Signs
614,shadowbox_nz,Still not convinced....,5,8 August 2002,"Firstly, I loved the Sixth Sense - I thought it was original, scary and moving. Secondly, I was disappointed by Unbreakable - good concept that didn't quite work. Again, sadly, I feel this is the case with Signs.It's a good premise with loads of potential, however to be blunt I feel M.Night is probably overestimating his own talent. He needs to work with someone else's material I believe as his own material is beginning to mystify me. I am a paranormal freak, and the promise of this movie was greatly anticipated by myself, however the story didn't seem to flow. Some of the dialogue was clunky, and Rory Culkin was gravely miscast - he is certainly no Haley Joel. The funny bits were often mistimed, and again to be blunt, I found M.Night's self-casting to be somewhat overindulgent.On the good side, the video footage of the sighting in Brazil at the birthday party was genuinely clever, and frightening. Indeed the looks ""outward"" from life in the house were often the best moments. The appearance of the alien at the end was also quite shocking, but again the dynamics were extremely odd. In short, I simply feel that this is a good idea that again failed to fire. Mel Gibson was good, but the script did him no favours. The ebbs and flows of the story just didn't work for me.",Signs

616,trainspotting,Very over-rated movie,4,17 February 2003,"I usually do not put my comments down for a movie but I think when a movie is very over-rated like this one I want to give my two cents.  My biggest problem with the movies is that the plot hole are huge and I think you may see my point after I list the top 5.5) Any race that flies across the solar system and can cloak themselves from all earthly radar would not be able to have their communications picked up by a baby monitor.4) I don't if you know people that have asthma but anybody I know has their puffer at all time no matter if it is the end of the world or not.
3) Any race that flies across the solar system can break through a wooden door.  Come on give me a break where are are the land weapons.  That air was explanation earlier in the movie is weak.2) Has anyone seen CNN when their is a hurricane in the states.  The grocery shelves are emptied, long lines of people leaving, people in churches etc. There was no panic in this movie not even by the father trying to save his two children.1) The biggest loophole is that the movie eludes to the fact the aliens want to harvest us but water is poison to them.  Last time I checked the human body is 80-90% water and would mostly be poison to them.  What are they going to do put us in a dehydrating tanks to get rid of the poison.",Signs
617,apowersdmb,See Signs a whole lot more,8,2 August 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan has done it again. Although this movie is quite different from his last two, his storytelling and method of terrifying an audience are still priceless. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix give great performances, as do the two children. Shyamalan is able to depict terror not by showing you a grotesque creature, but simply the expressions on the actors' faces. Their reactions, with help from a haunting score, send shivers down your spine. The storytelling is gripping and leaves you savoring for the next scene. This movie is great, in all aspects. Shyamalan is no fluke, for those that still doubt him. See Signs and you'll see a whole lot more!",Signs
618,piasa84047,A whole lot of nothing,5,27 August 2002,"This film has some very good things going for it. Mel Gibson gives his best performance to date. Joaquin Phoenix, who played the evil, whiny, wimp in Gladiator convincingly plays the polar opposite in this movie. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are very talented young actors. M. Night Shyamalan proves to be a very good director. His camera angles and long shots build suspense very well. With all of that going for it, this is still not a very good movie. As good as Shyamalan is as a director, he is just as bad as a screenwriter. From the get go there is a plothole through the middle of this that makes the whole movie not make any sense. He gives us a priest from a religion that probably doesn't exist that has lost his faith, his ever faithful brother, alien obsessed son, and cute but spooky daughter. We meet the sheriff, the bookstore owner and wife, the man that caused him to lose his faith, and thru flashbacks, his recently deceased wife. There are a few other people in the movie, but not many. Shyamalan gives us an isolated area in Pennsylvania that seems borrowed from an old Twilight Zone episode. The lack of speaking parts makes it seem all the more isolated. And then he blows it by asking us to believe that a global conspiracy may be afoot. He tries to pay homage to so many films from Independence Day and War of the Worlds to E.T. and the famous bigfoot home movie that it comes off as hokey. The final scene just adds to the ever growing list of plotholes. And in the end we find that this far-fetched and plodding film is trying to tell us that life is not an accident and everything happens for a reason. Shyamalan just goes a strange and pointless route to get there. The Sixth Sense this isn't. 5 of 10",Signs

Despite his loss of faith, however, Gibson still loves his children fiercely and he guards them very closely.Early in the film, Gibson's children discover a series of crop circles in their corn fields, and not long after, the news reports a significant increase in crop-circle sighting all over the world.  Are the Aliens coming? Are they trying to tell us something?You'll have to watch the film for the answers to those questions, but I will tell you that I don't think this film is really about aliens.  This film is really about human beings, and fate, and faith, and family.Shyamalan is adept at creating a very tense, mysterious atmosphere in this film, and Gibson and Phoenix are (as should be expected) excellent.

This was the creepiest sci-fi/thriller film (with the possible exception of Se7en) I have ever seen and I have been watching them for 45 years.  There are a number of creepy scenes:  (1) the claustrophobic scene which takes place in the closet of the Hess home, with the Hess family hunched over the television watching news footage of an alien invader - tres creepy, (2) the scene in which a dark form appears suddenly on the roof of the Hess barn in the camera's peripheral vison -- very creepy, (3) the sheer isolation of the Hess farmhouse -- creepy, (4) the isolation of Father Hess in the vet's home with an alien locked in the pantry -- stomach churning creepy, (5) the alien radio transmission on the baby monitor -- baby-stealing creepy.  This film relies upon one device to maintain the thrill:  an isolated person surrounded by an unseen dark force that doesn't reveal itself.  The trick in making an effective monster/thriller flick - don't show the monster much and keep the special effects to a minimum becuase they're not needed and can be counter-productive.

624,RLove,"1/4 part Hitchcock, 2 parts SNL, 3 parts disappointment",5,4 August 2002,"I don't regret going to see this movie and was entertained by it, but it should have been an awful lot more.  It's been promoted for more than a year now in previews, and the recent cover of Newsweek displayed M. Night Shymalan.  The headline: The Next Spielberg.  The truth: yeah, right.The opening credits felt like a Hitchcock movie to me: plain black and white credits, the suspenseful (though already familiar) theme song playing.  That was where the similarity ended.  The first half of the movie had suspenseful moments, but every single one of these was diluted by comedy to the point of becoming meaningless.  The most egregious example came early, when Gibson and Phoenix invesigated a possible intruder outside the house.  The scene began with a moment that I will confess made me jump.  It proceeded to become one huge joke playing off of Gibson's docile nature (more on that later).  The audience should have been on the edge of its seats; instead it was laughing.  The viewer remembers the scene, but only as a cerebral memory, not as a gut feeling.  The mood is completely killed.  Shymalan doesn't even try to recover the mood: the next scene features a recounting of the events meant to evoke more laughter.  I understand that people thought ""Unbreakable"" too slow and somber, but this was not the answer. Imagine Will Ferrel narrating ""The Others"" and you'll get the idea.Without the accompanying mood, the suspense was lost.  The last third of the movie was designed to make me jump a few times, but it was ridiculously predictable and failed.  There was also supposed to be a great deal of conflict over Mel Gibson's faith, but this was also ineffective.  The conclusion seemed contrived, but I won't complain about that because its artificial nature was part of the point.  Nevertheless, it was far from a great ending.  ***SKIP NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS***The characters were extremely disappointing.  Early in the movie, Shymalan makes a big point of Gibson's inability to be angry.  Later, he flips out on his children during the dinner scene.  I understand that he's under stress, but what he does amounts to psychological abuse.  But since Shymalan's so concerned with family relationships, his son of course walks over and gives his dad a hug so they can cry together.  Given that his son is at oldest ten, this is beyond precocity.  Considering the treatment his dad gave him, the kid would have been much more likely to throw a plate at him, and it would have been deserved.  As for Joaquin Phoenix, his part was more of a clown than a real character.  After his brilliant performances in ""Gladiator"" and ""Quills"" (side note, despite Phoenix, stay away from the latter), his talent is sadly wasted in ""Signs.""  The little girl was also disappointing.  In the basement she talks about ""this was in my dream."" There has been next to no setup to this, and there is no followup either. She just sort of hangs in the wind.  Lastly, the alien was disappointing. The only suspense that the movie actually has comes from NOT knowing what they look like.  As soon as we get a good look at one, the entire effect is blown.  In the Newsweek article, Shymalan cites ""Psycho"" as one of his favorite films.  Perhaps he should consider what damage would have been done to the shower scene if we saw the knife actually strike.The movie shows humor, displays conflict in the former priest, and is occasionally suspenseful, but only the first of these is done well.  Instead of weaving all of these elements in one masterpiece, Shymalan made ""Signs"" into three different movies, and I was never quite sure which one I was supposed to be watching.  Wait for video on this one. Without expectations: 5/10 With expectations: 2/10",Signs
625,wkbeason,A modern day Book of Job that would make Hitchcock proud.,8,1 September 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** If you are a believer that a suspenseful story cannot be well told with a compensating shock in the end to justify the telling, if you think that suspense requires action and flash more so than innuendo and suggestion for the mind's eye, if you are convinced that rich subtext and characterization cannot compete with a focus exploration of the actual menace made manifest before your eyes, then Signs is definitely not the movie for you.But, if you like what Hitchcock used to do with audiences, if you admire way Kubrick would frame the shot, or if you like films that explore internal human struggles as much as they expose the external forces with which we contend then you will find Signs to be a very satisfying achievement.The crisis of Graham Hess is brilliantly intertwined with a worldwide crisis.  But things develop slowly, carefully, meticulously constructed such that far more is happening in your mind than on the screen.  This is a precious, rare commodity in today's filmmaking.  M. Night Shyamalan deserves the highest respect for this achievement.  Sure, the film will have its detractors because it doesn't sizzle, it doesn't have very much action, there are some minor plot holes and it doesn't really grab you and throw you for the loop you expect to get after such a long, relentless build-up. But, for those who enjoy subtly of narrative development and depth of character, Signs is a refreshing moment in a summer filled with utter mediocrity.
Shyamalan uses the film to ask `Is it possible that there are no co-incidences?' or, to put it another way, `Can events be `signs' of bigger things?' His main character, Graham Hess, a former Episcopalian Priest, thinks he knows the answer.  But, the events of Signs lead him to ultimately reevaluate his answer.  In this way, the film effectively works on two levels simultaneously thereby making it Shyamalan's greatest work to date.On one level we have the invasion of the earth by extraterrestrials.  We slowly learn this based upon glimpses (small signs) of their physical presence and an outbreak of a worldwide crop-circle phenomenon (large signs).  On another level Graham Hess has lost his faith due to a personal tragedy.  We slowly learn the nature of this through various characters insistence on calling him `Father' and in dreams that he has reflecting his final meeting with his now dead wife.Shyamalan plays both these levels off each another throughout the film in and by the extensive use of irony.  Here are several examples.When Graham and Caroline are in the cornfield, he turns and walks away from her, pausing and states: `Caroline, stop calling me Father.'  Caroline: `What's wrong?'  `I don't hear my children.'  In this sense Graham's response refers most immediately to the fact that he can't hear Bo and Morgan playing.  But, at a deeper level it means he no longer hears his congregation and therefore, introduces his spiritual crisis.Bo leaves dozens of `half-empty' glasses of water on furniture throughout the house.  Many of the film's critics find fault with this.  Like most of the film's detractors, they attempt to apply (shallow, obvious) reason where it doesn't belong.  This is offered as a sign of some nebulous form of metaphysical trouble.  By the same token, these glasses - `half-full' - represent a sign that some force is making ready to take on the alien that invades the Hess home late in the film.  Water burns the alien's skin like acid - which perhaps is the primary reason for their aborting their invasion of the earth.To `protect' the children from `becoming obsessed' with news events on TV, Merrill secludes himself in the closet under the stairway with the TV thereby becoming obsessed himself.  In this way he learns that `experts' now think the crop-circles engulfing the globe are signs by which to navigate the planet, by which to `make sense' of the earth's terrain.  In the end, however, it is the coming of the aliens that provides Graham with the signs he needs to recover his faith.Before Graham reaches for the knife by which to see what lies under the door to Ray's pantry, Shyamalan shows us sliced vegetables on a cutting board - signs of a knife.  Then we pan left to reveal the knife lying there. Graham then cuts off a couple of fingers of the alien within the pantry when it abruptly reaches out for him from under the door.  Later, these missing fingers are a sign as to which alien captures Morgan toward the end of thefilm and feeds with other memories of signs in Graham's mind resulting in what becomes a resolution to the immediate crisis.Merrill's reference to events being `like War of the Worlds' plays nicely into the TV's description of ground forces assembling and people flocking to churches and synagogues.  Here, Shyamalan pays tribute to that classic sci-fi flick.  That's exactly what happens in that movie.  But, Graham reacts to people turning to religion in this moment of crisis lukewarmly. `I'm going back to the windows,' he says and returns to boarding up the house.so things can't get in.so you can't see out.  No signs allowed, that's the attitude of the former Father Hess.Here we need to discuss to more criticisms of the film.  Many contend that the boarding up of the house is a rip off of previous films.  They also contend that Graham and Merrill are inept in the manner that they deal with the crisis.  The second criticism is ridiculous.  Graham and Merrill and not strong characters.  The critics want something that Shyamalan is not attempting to provide.  The main characters are not heroic, they are faced with this crisis while bearing a tremendous wound and while having little or no inner strength to draw upon.  You might not like this fact, but it is handled quite well, works as Shyamalan intends.  Not liking a character is not evidence of either lack of character development or poor characterization.The first criticism fails to see that the film seeks to pay homage to the genre (particularly to Alfred Hitchcock).  Sure boarding yourself up in your house has been done before.  But, never in this context.  It is the context that is important whenever reading a sign and Signs is a collection of signs.  In this context, it represents an attempt to shut out the world, mirroring the psychological struggle of the whole family in general and in Graham in particular.  The criticism is shallow outcry of a viewpoint greedy for action, reason, strength, and effect when the entire point of the film is based on none of these.As the family is crying together at the dinner table, we pull back through the food and, more significantly, glasses of water to reveal the baby monitor, which immediately picks up on alien signals.  Graham then goes to check the TV only to discover there is no signal, a sign that, as Graham says, `It's happening.'In the final memory of Colleen, Graham hears her say that the truck hitting her `was meant to be' which is exactly the way a dejected Ray describes it earlier in the film.  In other words, they are telling Graham that the accident is a meaningful co-incidence.  He has rejected such a view.  But, his rejection has blinded him to signs both past and present.  (Just like the critics of the film.)  Graham tells Merrill that the last thing Colleen said was `See' and `Swing away.'  That Colleen was remembering a baseball game where Merrill was at bat.   But, in reality what she said was for GRAHAM to `see' and for Merrill to `swing away.'  Whether Graham intentionally misrepresents the event to Merrill or he simply doesn't remember clearly at that point is not made clear to us.  But, the point is that Colleen is calling Graham to `see' and in the context of the film to `see' the signs - which is a sign unto itself.The conversation between Graham and Merrill takes place during the second most important scene of the film.  Merrill is seeking comfort from Graham, he wants Graham to say something to take away the anxiety of Armageddon. Graham, in a philosophical tone, tells him that there are basically two kinds of people.  Those who see events as signs and therefore have hope and those that see events as random chance and are therefore filled with fear. Those with hope have it because `deep down they feel there will be someone to help them.'  Those with fear have it because `deep down they feel they're on their own.'Merrill says he is `a miracle man,' a man of hope.  But, Graham insists that things are random and `we are all alone.'  The irony of this statement comes later when Morgan has an asthma attack as aliens invade the Hess home. This is the film's most important scene.  Graham takes his son in his arms and helps him through the asthma attack without medication.  `The fear is feeding it,' he tells Morgan. `Believe it is going to pass.  Breath with me. Together.  We're the same.'This marvelous scene sets up Graham's - and the world's - redemption. Simultaneously, while helping Morgan through his asthma attack, as he tells his son to `believe,' Graham begins to believe in God again.  How? Ironically, by declaring his hate for God.  This hate is his first step on the road back to the priesthood.It is perhaps the greatest irony that Morgan has asthma and it saves his life.  Because his lungs are closed (placing him near death) when the alien attempts to inject poison gas through his nose, Morgan survives the assault. Equally ironic, because Bo has left glasses of water lying around the house, the final alien is scalded and falls under the blows of the bat from a minor league baseball strikeout king.There are many levels to Shyamalan's screenplay and they are all orchestrated in terrific harmony under his directorship.  Signs is a film that clearly tells us `there are no such things as coincidences.' `Everything happens for a reason.'  `Hope will win out over fear.' Whether or not you agree with this message, whether you find flaw with the film's ending in relation to its relentless build-up, Signs is nevertheless a modern version of the biblical Book of Job.  It is meant to create anxiety as entertainment while offering you an optimistic message as well.  You can either accept this offering or not.  But, M. Night Shyamalan has crafted his story well and has given us a work that will affect you in many ways the deeper you look into it.",Signs

630,mk4,"Tired, recycled hokum",1,10 August 2002,"As an art director maybe I'm qualified to point out some things other viewers may not grasp.This was a purely pointless exercise in film making with so many holes in the plot that it defied credibility which led to me fidgeting  and squirming in my seat for the full running time (spoilers ahead):A. For a rural  preacher-cum-farmer, Mel Gibson wears entirely too many brand new freshly bought clothes, has a nice supply of makeup personnel around to keep his hair obviously over-dyed at all times, and always seems to be distinctly UN-weatherbeaten for a man of the soil. Being freshly shaved throughout the movie seems to take away any realism from  the goings-on which would lead most folks appear quite ragged after a few days of what his character was supposed to be experiencing. Perhaps his character was written  to be the Martha Stewart of farming. Horribly miscast for box office value, GQ Farmer Mel sleepwalks through his role, making one wish for a rough hewn leading man-a guy with dirt under his fingernails (Harrison Ford, perhaps) that could at least make the character credible-in spite of the comic book dialogue.B. Gibson is a fella who vows not to bring TV into his world while sitting on the biggest story in U.S. history. The entire world is focused on the aliens in the Mideast and India and wrings its CNN-hands while back in the states, 45 miles from Philly, the world knows nothing. Mel does. He's cut off a creature's fingers while the alien is trapped behind a farmhouse door. Does anyone in his household care while he casually relates this incident and forgets about it? Heck no. They just go on watching TV and cracking insipid jokes. I believe both his inquisitive children and brother would want to know more and sneak-off and pay a return visit to the creature to take a curious peek at it...and maybe take matters into their own hands.C. Mel and his kin seem to live in a vacuum. The rural police just disappear after the first reel and never again go looking for Mel and family, even when the news goes worldwide and the end of the Earth seems very near. Unusual, 'cause in small towns like this the authorities are, well, neighborly and would be concerned at least, if not for Mel and his brother, for the children.  Phones never ring. Surely the police know the end of Pennsylvania is at hand and something must be done to save the town's Favorite Son And Family.D. Sophisticated aliens from another galaxy seem to travel through space sans clothing. Wonder if they walk around stark naked on their own planet where variations in temperature are not a problem. ? Or maybe this advanced race has ""evolved"" past the hangups found  here on Earth.Oh yes. They melt (in an obvious paean to the ""Wicked Witch's"" death in ""the Wizard of Oz"") when water is poured upon them.  The aliens didn't seem to undertake a thorough scouting report on the planet they insisted upon occupying (lotsa water here on Earth...or maybe they (gasp!) didn't know about water!).  Please. I spent six bucks for this?E. The aliens are easily routed and defeated by forces here on Earth with a glossed-over explanation that a mysterious and unexplained experimental strategy was undertaken by a group of parched middle easterners-which drove the creatures from our planet! Were they sprayed with water-laden crop dusters?F. M. Night Shyamalan's awkward and self-serving cameo goes on for far too long. Sure, his character COULD turn-up in rural Pennsylvania. So could lovable CrocMeister Steve Irwin, but both folks would be highly improbable occupying farmhouses in lovely Buck's County.
I just can't go on. 1 out of 10 for this overlong piece of Celluloid Sominex.If you want to witness highly entertaining (and far more believable) shtick of this genre, pick up a DVD of George Pal's ""War Of The Worlds"". Or ""The Day The Earth Stood Still.""  Or the original ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.""No need to hurry, though.Those films will be around a  heck of a lot longer than ""Signs"".",Signs
631,MystiKef,Want to utterly waste an hour and half? Watch Signs.,3,1 August 2004,"First of all..  I loved the Sixth Sense, and I am a great Fan of Mel Gibson and a few of the other talented actors in this terrible film.  I do not blame them.  Nobody could save this pitiful script.Please stop me if anyone has an answer for these GAPING plot holes:1. A highly advanced alien species has come to Earth.  They are so highly advanced that they have cloaking devices for their spaceships, rendering their city-sized ships completely invisible.  Yet...  they roam around the planet completely naked without any pieces of technology what-so-ever.2. Also..  these naked aliens are highly sensitive to water.  So sensitive it burns them like concentrated acid.  Yet they wander around NAKED on a planet covered with water (acid), with water vapor (acid) in the air, and water (acid) pouring from the sky.  And they are capturing creatures (humans) that have water (acid) pouring out of faucets and hoses and sprinkler systems.  The humans also can spit water (acid), bleed water (acid - blood is mostly water), and so on.  Yet, these NAKED HIGHLY ADVANCED aliens aren't smart enough to even put on a Hefty bag?  Or a rain coat? They run around naked?  Are you @#%&$#*% kidding me?3. They use corn fields for planetary navigation...  Riiiiiiggghhhtttt... So we could all mow our lawns and this advanced alien race would suddenly be lost?  I think any species that has mastered interplanetary travel would probably find a better navigation system than leaving symbols in grassy fields.  You know.. latitude and longitude..  or maybe a computer system of some sort..  GPS, theirs or take over ours...  Something. Just not corn fields.  Please.4.  About a dozen of these highly advance aliens try to get to Mel and family in the basement of their house..  yet a board and some nails stops them.  Once again..  Interplanetary travelers with city sized ships that can be rendered invisible..  stopped by a board and some nails.  Apparently they have not invented the cro-bar on their planet.5. The Nightly News actually said something like this:  ""A group of people have figured out how to defeat the aliens attacking our planet...  more on that after these messages...""  Are you kidding?  Someone figure out that you can throw WATER on the aliens invading our planet and the news doesn't tell everyone IMMEDIATELY?I could go on...  But I feel like I have wasted enough time by watching this pathetic attempt at a movie.  Why Mel?  Did you not read the script first?",Signs
632,Karlos-3,"Very Good movie, intellectual and thrilling..",8,5 August 2002,"Signs is a very good movie. I think it is the midpoint between Sixth Sense and Unbreakable as far as M.Night Shyamalan is concerned. In Sixth Sense.. The movie was greatly successful because of its thrilling story, while unbreakable had more of an intellectual debate that frustrated some seekers of thrill.. Signs is in between.. Signs is thrilling, but in the same time, Shyamalan proposes an intellectual dialog about faith, luck and pre-destination. Do things just happen or is there a plan? It's a respectable dialog though he obviously favors one side over the other.Signs is the story of a priest. Rev. Graham Hess who loses faith in his religion when his wife dies horribly in a freak accident. One that he failed to understand or accept and caused to completely reject the idea that there is any kind of guiding force guiding this world. Graham lives in a farm in a small town with two little kids and his brother who moved in after his failure in making a career in baseball.This small fragile family is immediately thrust into the events of an Alien invasion. Unlike war of the worlds and most other alien movies, this movie is not really about the aliens. This is why focusing on how and why the aliens came and how and why the aliens left is a waste of time. The movie is using this incredible event (an alien invasion) to show how this small broken family is dealing with a crisis. How the faith of the family is tested in this dilemma. Almost all the aspects of ""sci-fi"" and thrill in the movie can be found in other movies, but it's Shyamalar's ability to collect all these features in his movie and making them FIT. They fit perfectly. There isn't a scene when you laugh instead of being scared, I looked around the movie theatre as I watched the movie.. And when an anticipated scary moment was coming (someone is opening a door or looking through a hole) people stopped chewing their pop corn.. This is the sign of a true thrilling movie. When you don't feel that the scenes are standard clichés but actual parts of the story.As far as acting goes.. All the actors did a superb job led by Gibson. Phoenix is great and the four family members portray anguish, joy and fear with excellence. Shyamalan himself does a small role and he is a dreadful actor. Not only that, but I felt his appearance was a poor choice and broke the story a bit. Shyamalan looks Indian as it is his heritage. And it seemed very out of place to see a person of Indian origin in a supposedly very small town south of Philly. It's like casting a Native American actor to play a role in a movie about 15th century Scottland.. Makes no sense.The sound and music are very good, nothing original, but they do a good job of creeping you up.Finally, as far as Shyamalan's intellectual part of the movie.. It will fall to the individual's beliefs. Personally of course, I liked the ending because it chimed in with my beliefs, but I did feel that he made the ending too blunt and open.. He could have done it in more subtle ways.",Signs

I really like this movie and I think I've seen it about 5 times already. It is very well acted, with a great Mel Gibson and a remarkable Joaquin Phoenix. An outstanding scene in terms of acting is the scene where Mel Gibson is confronted with the guy who accidently killed his wife (played by the director - I still can neither pronounce nor spell his name) because he fell asleep in the car. The sadness and the anger on Mel Gibson's face is amazing.DON'T MISS IT!",Signs
635,popgun9,A tense and satisfying movie-going experience.,10,4 August 2002,"The roots of Signs run deep.  It's hard to shake the feeling of Howard Hawk's The Thing, the claustrophobic fear of Night of the Living Dead, or the menace of War of the Worlds.  It's all there in modern, restrained style.  It's a commentary on our world that most of the fear of alien encounters comes to us over TV sets in this story.  The twists and surprises make this film difficult to write about, but rest assured that every second is riveting.  The thrill of fifties horror and sci-fi films has faded due to current day action and demand for high-tech effects....but to Shyamalan's credit this present day genre film creates a mood and thrill not felt in many decades. Not to be overlooked, the past meets the present in a breathtaking fashion in Signs.",Signs
636,jasons_the_man_2000,Best scary movie in a while!,10,7 September 2002,"This movie was truly awesome. Mel Gibson is one of my favorite actors, and this movie only enhanced that for me. As a disgruntled reverand, he plays a role that just wouldn't be as good if someone else were in it. As his brother, Joaquin Phoenix does a fantastic job. I liked him in Gladiator, and I love him in this movie. I also like the fact that Rory Culkin is in this movie. I was a big fan of his brother's when I was younger, and he shows a lot of potential to be a great actor in the future, worthy of starring roles in a few years. The director, M. Night Shyamalan, is my favorite director. I like the fact that he played a sort of cameo as Ray Reddy. He is very good at blending all of the elements of a good scary movie, just as he was in Unbreakable. I can't wait for his next movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes scary movies!",Signs
637,James Felix,"I really wanted to like this, but....",5,12 August 2002,"SPOILERS GALORE--SPOILERS GALORE---LOTS AND LOTS OF SPOILERS HERE!! Ok, I really like M.Night Shymalan. I loved ""the Sixth Sense"", I loved ""Unbreakable"" and I really wanted to like ""Signs"". Unfortunately, too many utter implausabilities and failings of internal logic piled up for me to be able to do so. A brief list of them reads like this: How did the aliens, advanced enough to have mastered interstellar travel, NOT realize that the element covering 75% of our planet was so violently toxic to them? Why are they walking around stark naked? I mean, even a simple raincoat would have gone a long way towards facilitating their missions success, a full environment suit would have ensured it. For that matter, why crop circles? Again, they master interstellar travel but this is the most efficient navigational aid they come up with? The aliens must surely have realized that we have (and are inclined to use) weapons far deadlier than the baseball bat that causes them such trouble, why walk around unarmed? And speaking of being unarmed, Mel Gibsons rural Pennsylvania farmhouse doesn't have so much as a single shot 12 guage in it? Come on now! I really could go on but I'm sure you get the point.  Now, I fully understand that at it's heart this isn't a sci-fi movie, or even a horror movie. I know he's trying to make a point about the nature of God and faith and what have you. But the total of the glaring errors simply created too much disbelief to suspend.    On the upside, ""Signs"" IS perfectly directed, with good performances turned in by everyone (even that Culkin kid). Overall though, I'd say Mr. Shymalan dropped his batting average to .660 with this one.",Signs
638,TheGreenSaga,Amazing film that captures the genius of Shaymalan.,10,3 August 2002,"Signs is an amazing movie that exemplifies the true genius that Shayamalan brings to the film world.  Shayamalan is one of the most original and brilliant filmmakers ever.  His method of ""show, don't tell"" brings to the Supernatural Thriller what Stanley Kubrik brought to Science Fiction. Signs is the third film in a trilogy of similar but uniquely creative films: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. Signs moves slowly through the lives of the Hess family: a sworn ex-reverend (Gibson), his much younger brother (Phoenix), and two children. The film jumps right into riddle and foreshadow, then decides to play the field (no pun intended) until the breathtaking final chapter of the film.      After an arrangement of crop signs appear across the globe and in Hess' backyard, his judgement becomes clouded by suspicion, faith, and philosophy. Throughout the film we are exposed to the highway of thought that has been bottled up inside Hess' head.  This mixes with the strange supernatural insinuations and pan/tilt pop-up terror. Gibson and Phoenix turn in excellent performances, Gibson now taking on the role of Shayamlan's recurring ""quiet protagonist"".  Phoenix switches gears from his spectacular and underappreciated performance in ""Gladiator"", to that of a teenager-like adult who acts as both a younger brother and a second father to the children. Signs is a movie that will both frighten you to the point of tears and put you in a deep mediation long after the credits role.

639,Meckjompa,One word: Disappointment....,3,18 March 2003,"After seeing Sixth sense and Unbreakable i had pretty big expectations before i saw Signs, even though i had heard some mixed opinions from my friends. The thing was that i actually thought Unbreakable was better than SS, unlike most of the people i know. So i was thinking that Signs has to be even better. I was wrong...The story itself is probably one of Hollywoods all time-leaders: Alien-invasion....and sure, Schlyman(or whatever his name is spelled) does his thing with creeping and subtle suspense, not underestimating the viewers, as usual. But something is missing, i can't put my finger on it but it just doesn't have that edge that the previous films. Surprise ending? I THINK NOT! It couldn't have been more predictable and actually cheesy.... aliens can't handle water...please! Earth surface is 70% water. Think the aliens wouldn't have analyzed it before they came? I don't....

I was one of the myriad of movie fans who were intrigued with M Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" (Hollywood Pictures, 1999) and figured that the movie's success was well deserved and was in line to buy the DVD when it debuted.Then came ""Unbreakable"" (Touchstone Pictures, 2000).  I never saw the film in theatres because I got the gist from the promotional onslaught before the movie opened.  To my surprise, the movie featured a story that was oddly similar to ""Sixth Sense.""  There's a character who has a unique special ability and learns to develop and use the gift to help others.  I rented the movie and was thoroughly disappointed at the blatant re-packaging that Shyamalan had pulled off; convincing his new fans to spend more money to watch basically the same movie-and lead actor-again.And now there's ""Signs.""  I was again overwhelmed by the media blitz that Touchstone launched many weeks before this film opened.  I saw enough in the trailers to get the point of the film.  And it again was very similar to the other super-paranormal films Shyamalan's has made.  Crop circles begin appearing, and people have to figure out why it's happening.  I watched the airline version a couple weeks ago and from here on have vowed to never watch any future Shyamalan films.  I was sickened that I spent $5.00 to watch it on the airplane!M Night Shyamalan had a unique perception of the supernatural in his ""The Sixth Sense.""  But he beat his concept dead with ""Unbreakable"" and made it all the worse with ""Signs.""It's amazing the kind of movie that people will pay money to sit down and watch.  I suppose, however, that I may be a more discerning patron that will never watch movies from directors like Shyamalan, Cameron Crowe or Curtis Hanson (at least, from now on after Crowe made ""Vanilla Sky"" and Hanson helmed ""8 Mile"").I still have my copy of ""Sixth Sense.""  But rest assured that I'll never add ""Signs"" to my Paper-Weights (titles I own but can never finish in one sitting).  I'll save that bin for ""Sixth Sense.""",Signs

In any case, this film is the only film to have got me scared, sweating, almost unable to watch. Unlike the much over-rated The Ring, Signs makes your heart-pound faster without spoiling it with a convoluted, non-sensical, ridiculous plot. Even with some ridiculous plot points, and ridiculous scenes, and ridiculous director cameos, the suspense remains. The last 10-15 minutes are truly terrifying- long silences, complete and utter darkness, bumps,footsteps,heavy breathing leave the viewer on the edge of their seat.
**SLIGHT SPOILER** One of the best scenes has Joaquin Pheonix walk up a stair case, camera positioned, fixed, at the bottom. Slowly, he gets to the top, turns around, window behind him, and says to his family below- ""It's all Clear. they've gone"". What happens next I won't spoil, but it's surprising, and a master stroke from Shyamalan It's one of the most gripping scenes in a film I've seen recently, matched only by another scene in the film, involving a hand-held camera video,a children's birthday party and an alien. As riveting as it is nerve-racking**SLIGHT SPOILERS END** The suspense begins early in the film and is sustained for much of the entire film, but the last minutes don't just take it up a notch, they take it up 10 notches. Having said that, the actual resolution, after 10 frantic, frightning minutes, is a major disappointment, rather trite, and the film is not otherwise flawless, inconsistincies in plot making the film suffer. 8 and 1/2 out of 10.

The humans are no Einsteins either, the radio communications used by the aliens, easily picked up by a common baby monitor, somehow escape the higher tech scrutiny that you'd expect from the scientific community or the military. And where is the military? At no time are there big explosions from the usual response to a threat, oh, say invisible hostile alien spaceships hovering over major cities all around the world.Nope, it's a ""wait and see"" approach here (maybe they were praying for rain). And what were the aliens going to do with the planet or us after we'd been conquered? A planet covered mostly by water,which is hardly an ideal vacation paradise for them is it? Perhaps they were going to tow it away and Ebay it. I dunno....and neither does M.

So maybe they'll burn us as fuel. Or Ebay us.

The movie follows a man, his brother and his two children as they struggle to survive an alien invasion and their own inner struggles as a family.M Night Shyamalan is able to build levels of tension in his movies unlike any other director, this movie, 'the village' and 'the sixth sense' are clear examples of his skills as a horror director- the constant questions his movies throw at you may seem to have answers laying in plain sight upon re-watch, but upon initial viewing it is near impossible to see where the films are going.'Signs' is not Shyamalan's best example of a growing mystery, as the plot is quite easy to make predictions about and a pre-established knowledge of his movies will most likely mean you can guess almost every plot beat.However what it lacks in mystery it makes up for in suspense and character, the eerie silence of the house and the world surrounding it leaves the viewer vulnerable and almost expecting a monster to appear out of nowhere at any second, helping us to see and experience the characters motivations and feelings.All of the performances in this movie are spectacular; Joaquin Phoenix in particular elevates his character past an unneeded side character which he so easily could have been.The movie does feel as though it crumbles under its own weight in the last few minutes- the tying up of all the plot threads is very satisfying however it feels very rushed.Overall, Signs is a very good movie with a few issues with it's plot; I would definitely recommend it and it deserves more praise than it has received.Thanks for reading :)",Signs
651,Xenoid,"""The Birds"" with Aliens",9,6 August 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan's film ""Signs"" is a well done spooky piece on crop circles, aliens and all such things. Shyamalan has proved that he is a talented individual, molding a story around the strange phenomenon of crop circles. When I first heard of the film, I was wondering what could you possibly make about crop circles, because you really don't know very much about them. Shyamalan took crop circles, mixed it in the batter with elements from War of the Worlds, and The Birds, and out came ""Signs.""Superb art direction, sound, as well as acting from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The kids Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin also were great, showing also that Shyamalan, like Spielberg, is good at directing kids.Great creepy film that I highly reccomend! Enjoy!",Signs
652,philmck,"Leaden, portentous, unreal",3,10 August 2002,"M Night has a style that is annoying.  Seemed to work for me in 6th Sense, but the next 2 -- yuck.  His stilted directing style loads lead weights onto the characters and makes the poor actors struggle to be able to create living, breathing people.  Unfortunately, in this movie, the actors pretty much sink under M Night's heavy hands, w/the notable exception of Cherry Jones as Officer Paski.  Of course, she has the BIG advantage of not being in that ""locked in the house"" segment, which went on & on & on &... , well you get the idea.  She brought the movie up from being a 1 for me, and the first 1/2 hr or so seemed to be going somewhere.  But then, yawn time.  It's amazing, usually I dislike movies for too many special effects and not enough character development.  Now here's a man who brings NO special effects and still NO character development.  Yuck.",Signs
653,missmizu-4,don't listen to those who say it's only an alien movie,6,6 August 2002,"The film is humorous, suspenseful, touching, and beautifully acted. Other than the religious implication and the ***SPOILER*** [actual green alien], i like everything about it. I love Phoenix in his role, and Gibson delivers a great character. The kids are cute, but they are not overly cheesy. IMO, this film is not about aliens or a specific religion. It's about what people go through in their hours of needs, how they react when their faith is challenged, how they change after that. Mr. Shyamalan really knows how to build suspense and tell a story. He's the real deal. Recommended.",Signs
654,pyewacket,One more strike and Shyamalan's OUT,1,27 August 2002,"I loved THE SIXTH SENSE -- even felt it deserved the Best Picturenomination it got.  And when Shyamalan's UNBREAKABLE came acropper a year later, I thought it was a noble failure -- everyone's allowedone of those.But with SIGNS, my goodwill is gone.  I'm beginning to think that, likeJames Cameron, Shyamalan desperately needs a WRITER.  SIGNS is amess -- full of ""aliens are coming"" gobbledygook, cringeworthy lines likeRory Culkin's protestation that he wants to stay in their home because ""it'swhere Mom was"" and excruciatingly poor acting from just about everyonebut Cherry Jones, who does her best to hold her head up high and not beembarrassed by this dreck that is her biggest shot yet at big-screen renown.Everyone knows the plot essentials by this point, suffice it to say thattheir are loose ends and plot holes big enough to steer a spaceship through, and when it's all over, you can only wonder why the aliens were so intenton terrorizing and/or killing this boring group of rural Pennsylvanians. Weren't there bigger fish to fry in the United States? 
(Possible SPOILER): Every seemingly minor element that is introduced --Joaquin Phoenix's sports past, Culkin's medical problems, the daughter'sobsessive/compulsive relationship to water -- might as well have a big""Deus ex machina"" sign announcing it, as each is obviously beingintroduced for a payoff later on, without feeling in any way organic to theplot or the characters.Save this one for DVD on a night  when there's absolutely nothing else todo -- or better yet, just skip it altogether.",Signs
655,Pzippity,Four Characters in Search of an Author,8,7 August 2002,"It is becoming increasingly apparent that Mr. Shyamalan is in danger of becoming a one-shot wonder.  Both Signs and Unbreakable are stylish thrillers with excellent acting and excellent direction, but the stories in both leave you scratching your head afterwards - is that it?!  The structure of the movie is great, all kinds of disparate events coming together at the end when all is made clear, but to what end?  It's like building Fort Knox to house a Ronald McDonald Happy Meal toy!  I keep holding out hope that he will be able to recreate the terrific adventure that the Sixth Sense was, but, sorry to say, it doesn't look like it's going to happen.  So much talent, so little payoff!",Signs
656,Dario_Gino,Not Just a Thriller,9,29 August 2008,"M. Night Shyamalan is a fantabulous director with the ability to set a plot that is both breath-taking and mysterious. Each scene is significant and cleverly set up. He always adds a deeper, more intellectual meaning to the movie. For instance, although he does a great job with the frightening and suspenseful aliens that attack earth, the movie also contains a character (played by Mel Gibson) that loses his faith because of a death in his family. After, experiencing all of the horrifying events when the creatures come to their house, he discovers that things aren't just coincidences, but miracles and that God has a deeper purpose to everything that happens. This is an entertaining and thrilling movie. Get ready to have your muscles tense and your soul be emotionally moved.",Signs
657,SarumanWhite,Much ado about what?!,5,20 August 2002,"I might be insensitive or plainly dense, but I don't see what's so great about this movie. Just don't... Yes it's a rip-off of almost every hare-brained alien flick, and even ufologists are probably ashamed of it - the vulgarization of their concepts reaches a surprising pitch in this 2-hour drag. I absolutely agree that the whole 'alien' part of the story is so unbelievably stupid that I started to look for satire, parody about 15 minutes into the film. I then I looked again, and again, and again... And I did not find it. The fact that the most ridiculous alien invasion ideas prove true during the course of the film somehow does not convey the idea that the director makes fun of them. For a parody there's too much 'boo' element and clawed hands grasping out of the dark. Is it about searching for faith? Well, then presentation certainly leaves much to be desired. I don't see how finding that asthma can protect from air-born poison lets one come to terms with Deity. Oh yeah, it might, but so can, for instance, observing dung beetles - everything is a part of creation. And how you are supposed to think about all that after being primitively but effectively shocked out of your pants by half an hour of invisible horrors attack?",Signs

659,jcorpuz@ucsd.edu,"OK movie, till the ending",3,24 March 2003,"This movie had a good sense of creepiness to it, a good cast, and some great visuals. It was actually turning out to be a good movie until the horrendous ending, which reeks of b-Movie filler.  First, this movie successfully builds suspense and fear by offering only glimpses of the creature (which has been done successfully in other movies as well, a typical technique that's used).  If you decide to reveal and show your monster in full, steady, prolonged shots you take a big risk of letting the audience down. Signs took the risk and failed. The creature looked very typical of the little green men sci-fi flick mold of monster and appeared to be cartoonish in a way.  This robs the the movie of alot of its steam, and that's an understatement.  The second thing that just kills this movie is this, if I were trying to invade another planet, I presume I would survey the planet to find out whether or not it's covered mostly by a substance which would be highly lethal to me! The logical fallacy here is huge and thus causes the movie to end on a very sour note.",Signs
660,quigley95,sells out at the end,6,28 September 2002,This was a very enjoyable movie full of suspense and in the begining you really are interested in what is going to happen next and the film does begin to give you a sense of fear and forboding and you wonder exactly what is going on.  But unfortunately the film for me sold out big time in the end.  The Sixth Sense and The Others work because they keep you wondering all the way through the film and the Mothman Prophecy also worked for me because you leave the cinema still wondering who or what is the Mothman.   In Signs as in Jeepers Creepers you are eventually shown an unbelievable alien creature and the storyline just loses the plot completely.  For a film to work it has to be believable.  But I think an intelligent Alien race that can travel across the galaxy but can't open doors and are afraid of water just dose'nt make sense to me.I think if Signs had left us wondering just exactly who did make the crop circles and what exactly where they and what did they want then it would have made for a much more interesting film also if the storyline had remained a local phenomonon and not gone to world wide one it would have been more believable.  I think leaving a piece of the supernatural in this movie would have added to its suspense.,Signs

Night Shyalaman's latest film would give me creeps, just like his previous two.While the film did have some terrifying moments, 'Signs' proved to be an emotionally powerful and very insightful film.  While, on the outset, it may be a scary film, 'Signs' is more about the struggle of a family to survive at a time when danger is lurking.I have not seen many films like this- a film that completely consumed me. The last time I saw a film like this was when I watched 'The Blair Witch Project'- another horrifying film, but not without depth, and true beauty.Everybody should see this film.

Lack of originality aside, I found this movie to be engrossing and often genuinely scary.  There's also plenty of humor and some thought-provoking dialogue.  Sci-fi genre fans will probably not care too much for ""Signs"", as the focus of the movie is not on technology, aliens, or babes in tight outfits; rather, it concentrates on one family's experiences and how they cope with the threat, with each other, and questions of faith. It's not a great movie, but it's definitely worth watching.",Signs
663,Tweedtheatre,I thought M Night was suppose to be a good film maker...,5,11 January 2003,"I was dragged to this film over the summer and I have regretted the move ever since.  I don't watch many Hollywood films and this just confirmed my belief that 99% of those films are not worth handing $7.50-$10.00 dollars over for.  Ah the plot holes, where to begin, there are so many.  Now I'm going to get attacked and people are going to say, ""But your missing the point if you overanalyze the plot, listen to the message!""  No, actually, if you like this film you are missing the point of fine film making.  Great films do not contain such horrible plots as what follows.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!1. M Night Shamlyan's character should be in jail.  He killed a woman just six months ago with his car.  Maybe under some obscure loophole he gets out of jail time, but at the very least his driver's license should get taken away for more then six months.  Then the humor of this is that in every scene he is seen driving.2. The aliens creating super spaceships, but lacking in any type of protection or weaponing what so ever.3. Said super spaceships hiding themselves during the day, but happily turning on their lights so that they CAN be seen when humans normally would not be able to see them.4. The fact that the signs in the cornfield of the main family in the movie fail to cause any type of stir.  Yes yes, Gibson yells to no one imparticular that he isn't going to report the Signs, but the problem is that he already has and that many people know about them: the police officer, the troublemaking brothers that the police officer said she talked to, and I'm assuming her superiors, who would have loved to report something big to the government.5. Gibson's character's failure to do anything that aligns with human instinct.  I'm going to head to where more people are as opposed to try and take on the aliens that I know are going to come on my farm land.6. Then again Gibson's character does know that the aliens for some reason can not break through wooden structures and have nothing to help them break anything!  Yeah, that's not a plot hole!7. The aliens' failure to realize that water hurts them.  The aliens had done many scouting attempts according to the movie.  Not once, not ONCE in all of their years had they encountered rain?Okay, there are more plot holes, but those are the big ones folks.  See, good movies do not have these plot holes.  Sure you can have a good message, but that doesn't give you the artistic right to have a crappy plot.  A bad plot takes away from the movie of course, if you like this movie, you obviously have been watching way too many Hollywood films.  Please, if you like this movie, check out the following films:  Amelie, The Red Violin, O Brother Where Art Thou, Life is Beautiful, and Sex and Lucia.  Those films are truly beautiful and might just change your life forever.",Signs
664,SILV3R,The UK perspective,5,16 September 2002,"I had gone to great lengths to watch this movie without knowing anything about the plot other than what I had learnt from the numerous viewings of trailer before every film for the last month or so. I had managed to ban anyone who had seen it from telling me anything about the plot, just so that I could go into the film with my own expectations, and could then have the pleasure of trying to work out the inevitable plot twists that you expect to accompany a Shyamalan film. I had enjoyed his previous two efforts (although I am not a fan of Stuart Little) and was hoping - expecting - to be entertained and confused by the writer/producer/director/actor's movie.The Signs opens by throwing clues and red herrings about so that your brain immediately starts to calculate likely outcomes and try to fathom which information to discard. Assumptions that we all know and understand the various theories behind crop circles and their hoaxes helps to maintain the narrative's speed in getting to Shyamalan's version of events. Based almost exclusively on a farm owned by Mel Gibson, where he lives with his brother, son and daughter, there is clearly meant to be a sense of claustrophobia within the film. Gibson only leaves the farm twice within the movie, once in his memories and once to visit the man who killed his wife (played by Shyamalan) in the car crash he continuously flashes back to. The enclosure is further strengthened when the family barricade themselves into the farm house.Its not giving too much away to state that this is essentially an alien invasion movie. The Signs is presented like a microcosm of Independence Day, and would have perhaps been more suited to an episode of ID: The TV Series should they have ever made it. The clues given earlier in the movie that forshadow the ending are all too easy to spot and work out their importance. Even if you are the worlds worst sleuth there isn't an overwhelming realisation moment when you finally spot the connections between the opening and the end. For those of us who enjoy seeking out the connections, we are left disappointed as many of the earlier events are left unexplained whether they bore any relevance to the conclusion or not. This is particularly disappointing if you are a fan of Shyamalan's writing as, until now, the plants and woven links running through his movies were part of his massive appeal. Similar undertones and issues are dealt with, most of all being Shyamalan's constant investigation into the spiritual world and the conflict of religion with the unexplained. Unfortunately, like almost everything else in The Signs, the study falls short of either reaching a conclusion or creating enough conflict to justify its inclusion in the script. Here it is a particular shame as a three way fight between religion, the unexplained and precognition could have been the boost this movie so badly needed to take it from average (by an average directors standards) to at least something that bit special.This film is ultimately unimpressive. The cast are underused, criminally in the case of Phoenix, the plot is underdeveloped and feels like one half of a story, and visually what could have potentially been a stunning mix of unexplained imagery and haunting glimpses turned into straight-to-video mistakes. The scariest thing about Alien was that you never fully saw the one thing that caused the fear, this is perhaps something that could have been considered when this movie was being made. On a more positive note, should you go to see this movie having no preconceptions about it being a movie by the man who made The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, then you are far more likely gain some pleasure from it. This is not a bad movie, but it must be questioned whether its release would have been quite so widespread and successful, or even attracted the cast it did, had it not been for the fascinatingly monikered author.",Signs

What you don't understand about this movie is that this movie is not about aliens! It is about faith! For example... Merill Hess always thought it was wrong not to swing that bat and Bo was able to see things into the future like her mother and Morgan had asthma. At the end they all connect! Merill's purpose was to swing that bat so he could kill the alien! Bo had dreamt all this and Morgan was supposed to have asthma so he wouldn't breathe the poison! Graham's faith was being tested so at the end of the movie he saw everything. His wife dying was meant to be! That is what the signs where, not he crop circles! The alien part was just to move the story along. M. Night Shyamalan is a great storyteller! This is not a bad script, no bad acting, and also who cares about the special effects!

666,DeadpoolX,Almost excellent,8,17 April 2003,"For all the newspaper critics' bluster about M. Night Shyamalan filling Hitchcock's shoes, this director has made quite an interesting niche all his own.  His movies are unconventional, with humor, suspense, well-crafted dialogue and minimal violence.  Signs may well be his best work to date - I'll admit it had me jumping at shadows for quite a while after watching it - but the ending is simply unforgivable, particularly in an otherwise excellent thriller.SPOILERS AHEAD.Signs is a unique film - all its flaws come into play during the last five minutes.  Shyamalan makes the inevitable mistake of showing the alien clearly.  He should have left it at the blurred newsreel footage, which was effectively disturbing.  I was willing to forgive and forget - until Graham is seen donning his priest's collar.  If we're to accept the film's assertion that everything somehow adheres to a plan set in motion by some higher power - let's call it God - does Shyamalan seriously expect us to believe that Graham would return to the priesthood when God saves his son from the terminal asthma inflicted upon him by God in the first place? God doesn't have the best track record in this movie.  He apparently cut Graham's wife in half with a truck, traumatized a mild-mannered veterinarian for life, made Graham's daughter neurotic about her drinking water and, oh, ARRANGED AN ALIEN INVASION OF EARTH AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HALF ITS POPULATION - all to bring a single jaded priest back to the fold.

First of all the soundtrack is one of the more fantastic ones out there, and the whole film had a very Hitchcockian feel.The acting was great, dialogue was great, my only problem besides the obvious aliens invade a planet full of the thing that kills them, water, was how poorly Gibson and Phoenix react during the ending home invasion. Aliens are banging at the door and they literally have no weapons in their hands when their children's lives are at stake. It's unlikely yet plausible they wouldn't own a gun on a farm but they had a kitchen full of knives and the obvious baseball bat. Then they just plumb forgot to board up the attic door. Just really poor and unlikely reactions to aliens who are trying to murder them.Other than that probably the 2nd best Shamalyn Film next to Sixth Sense out there.

Because Signs doesn't quite make a great deal of sense.It has great cinematography, and quite a lot of the acting is good, but it's boring delivery and plot-hole plagued ""storyline"" makes it a real chore to watch. I was barely able to finish it because it was quite a boring piece of drivel. It was like they came up with the various events of the film and squeezed it all in together. Yeah, that'll do for a film. Here are some *SPOILER* examples: ""Let's make the aliens be able to travel to earth but unable break through wood"" (This is one point that Tom Logan in Scary Movie 3 says) ""We'll write the aliens to attack humans even though they are composed of water, even though that kills the aliens"" (The human body is composed 90-ish% of water) ""Let's have an alien just suddenly stand around at one point whilst being attacked"" (An obviously carelessly ultra-clear continuity mistake for what excuse...?!) ""Let's have a kid killing a vicious dog whilst it's brutally trying to attack him without any noise being made from it. No barks, no growls. No screams. Just the quiet rural air"" (Perhaps a drugged common sense failure?) ""We'll write that special space sensory machine can't pick up alien signals but that a baby monitor can"" (Hell why not have an Orange Cinema Advert moment with you're future ideas!! ""So what, then, what next? A mobile phone? An MP3 player? A microphone! Or maybe even a laptop!"") Yeah, those are extremely excellent ideas! No, they really are. For a pot-smoker. I mean come ON guys! A primary school kid could write a better plot. No wonder Scary Movie 3 p***-took it. Really SM3 should've done more to take the p***, using those plot-holes I mentioned above. I thought they over-did the whole religious faith thing, too. I think that ruined the film, too. By the way, I was joking about the sequels, because...well, from those plot-holes, don't bother.

672,Drew48,"Stop ""Signs""",6,12 September 2008,"We watched this movie Saturday night. While the pace is much like watching grass, or corn, grow, you eventually get sucked into the whole, silly plot which is about aliens landing in a corn field in Kansas and, instead of taking over the state capitol, or a 7-11, they concentrate all their energy on taking over a farm house where 4 people live. I have some questions! Why is it that aliens, who have the technology that allows them to travel 100's of thousand's of light years, can't open a door? Maybe the aliens aren't from ""out there."" Maybe they are by products of genetically altered corn. Maybe water makes them swell up and pop. And, why is corn a symbol of evil, or creepiness? I realize that it is a recyclable food, but evil? I just don't get it. Also, what does Mel Gibson do for a living now that he is unfathered; what does his brother do besides smoke and watch television in a closet? Why don't the kids go to school? Why is no one bothered when the boy murders his dog with a serving fork? What happened to the meat on the barbecue? Where's PETA in all this? Why are there 1252 half empty water glasses all over the farm house. I realize the daughter has a problem with water (hmm, maybe she's part alien), but doesn't any one ever clean a glass? Don't they ever run out of water glasses? Do you have 1252 water glasses in your house? Why does the younger brother hit the water glasses with his baseball bat? Wouldn't it have been easier, and more accurate, just to throw water on the alien? How can you break a bat on a water glass? How come the alien can't get through the wood slats nailed to the windows, but can carve strange patterns in the same wood. It seems to me that he (it?) would just make one of those patterns bigger, and he's (it's) in. Why does Mel Gibson, who is the father who was a Father, lose his faith when his wife is killed, but get it back when an alien is watered to death in his house? Why didn't the aliens bring raincoats, and umbrellas? Why does the boy who has asthma and sucks on his inhaler every 30 seconds throughout the entire movie not have the inhaler when he is in the basement? Why is the boy dead and then not dead? Is it a miracle, or is it Hollywood? Why was this movie made? Did anyone actually read this script before the movie was made? Why did we watch it?

673,lights-5,Most tedious film of the year,1,18 February 2003,"Perhaps it's because ""Taken"" presented an alien-theme story that kept you on the edge of your seat for most of 20 hours that this film seemed so staggeringly slow and tedious.  ""Taken"" didn't drown in so many cliches, either.  This was ""Night of the Living Dead"" meets ""Field of Dreams.""The story had nothing unique or particularly interesting about it, and I didn't feel the actors were ever in character, not even the kids.  I never felt they were uneasy or scared, and thus, neither was I.  After about 35 endless minutes, I watched most of the movie at double speed with subtitles, didn't miss a thing, and even then, it seemed slow.  I think the day is over when anyone can be spooked by someone taking 5 minutes to walk down a corridor with thumping sounds off screen.  Can this have been made by the same director as ""The Sixth Sense""?  It doesn't seem possible. The deleted scenes on the DVD were more interesting than the film itself and they added needed character background.  I can't believe they were cut for time when the movie had so many scenes that contained endless minutes of nothing.  Others have mentioned the plot holes, and I totally agree. The entire concept of a race which can be destroyed by water coming to earth is plain silly.  And why, when the TV reports that people in other areas have found ""ancient"" ways of defeating the aliens, do they not report what that method is?  ""I'mmmm melllltinnnggggg...""",Signs

Every once and awhile it was so good, I could feel my heart racing. Also, I don't really like science fiction, but I liked this one.

His earlier film ""Wide Awake"", which isn't a bad movie, was soon forgotten. Many people have never even heard of it. With three movies in the can he moved on to his next one, Unbreakable. I actually enjoyed Unbreakable. I felt it to be a very creative film with another good story. Unfortanately, many people shared opposite views than mine and Unbreakable did not do as well as I hoped. Soon after Unbreakable, Signs was announced and I knew that a movie about aliens directed by M. had to be good. So i waited a year, anxiously awaiting the arrival of Signs. Finally the day came.I saw Signs on a 70 ft. movie screen by my house. I saw it at my favorite theater, obviously because of the screen. When the opening credits started I was incredibly hoping that this would be a good movie. The credits were strong and powerful, with music by James Newton Howard, I was immediatly hooked. The movie was exactly what I hoped for. It was creepy, inteligent, comical, suspenseful, and just a great experience to watch. M. Night Shyamalan is truly a master of his profession. He can write and direct and he's good at doing both. I had chills while watching the movie. I thought Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix fed of each others line brilliantly. Even the children could act. The daughter was very funny. Wherever you are Mrs. Culkin, keep shooting out kids because the all can act. Rory Culkin did suprise me because i didn't think he could perform at the level in which he did. The score to the movie was fantastic. As an avid score collector I would know. Overall, the movie lived up to my expectations and went beyond them.Now you shouldn't just shrug and say, ""What is this kid talking about...he's such an idiot."" I go to a movie almost every weekend and i usually see more than one. Now there are stupid people out there who think they know what they are talking about, but they don't. They think if they use big fancy words us neandrathols will think they are king and believe everything they say. Well don't, listen to me and everything will just be fine and dandy.TRUST ME, GO SEE SIGNS.",Signs
677,tehfro,Hitchcock reborn...,8,3 August 2002,"I don't want to give anything at all away, but this movie was such a joy to watch.  Probably the best new film in several years.It's not about the gore, or jumps (and there are a LOT in this movie), but it's about the mood and suspense, and this film delivers big-time. Incredibly well-crafted, pretty much flawless flick.  Any Hitchcock fan will eat this movie up, and it's got some touches of warmth to boot.Anyone who hated this movie has ADD or was expecting a pure Sci-Fi/Horror or SFX romp flick.  It's not about what is shown, but what isn't shown and how it isn't shown that builds the tension.  I was on the edge of my seat for most of it.Pretty much every trick in the book is in this one and it's amazing.There's many subtle touches from the director to add to the mood. 
Great acting, writing, and pacing from everyone involved. 
10/10... this is a shoe-in for Best Picture, IMHO, at this point.  Go see it now if you have any taste.",Signs
678,vorhese76,What A Crappity Crap movie,3,10 August 2002,"I didn't really like it. It was too preachy and the aliens were moronic. Here are two perfect descriptions:""Hey, look at that planet. It's 75% poison. Let's land there! Hopefully they won't have doors here.""I've decided that what the aliens did would be roughly equivalent to me and my friends getting together and attacking a planet where the majority of lifeforms subsisted on lava,and were themselves 60% lava. The number one resource on the planet would be, of course, lava. Lava would fall from the sky. Lava would cover a good 75% of the planet.What a bunch of religious propaganda and a sell-out ending. So, aliens evolved beyond pants? The plot sunk in. Aliens. Defeated due to doorknobs. And wood. They travelled a countless distance to attack a farmhouse. Poorly.The Simpsons episode where the aliens are defeated with planks of wood with nails in them came to mind.If this was a ""scouting"" mission, they probably should have picked up on the whole ""75% water"" aspect. Namely, what were the directors/aliens thinking? I love how they remind us that they have scouts just so we can make fun of them for invading a planet filled with water, where it also rains water, and water is used daily by all life forms on said planet. Also, after all that talk of having to find a way to beat the aliens back, they seem susceptible to baseball bats, and therefore more susceptible to baseball bats with moist towels on them, or possibly bullets and missles.Gotta love the fact that they don't know how to open doors either. Poor Gary (which is what I deem to be the name of that alien now), getting locked in a pantry, then missing his army's retreat and running into a room filled with glasses of water and humans. To top that off, he fails at killing an asthmatic, unconcious, child. I love how the only way they can kill you is by sticking their hand in your face (or maybe that was just Gary and his Private Pyle-like antics). Failures, a race of failures. They are very good at shaking and banging on doors though, oh yes!The ships, oh the ships. Yes, they are invisble in the day, but glow brightly at night. Gooo aliens!Overall, quite a funny movie. I couldn't help but laugh at some scenes, like the one I described above, with Gary bursting into the room full of humans. The whole theater gasps, and is then interrupted by my maniacal laughter. I demand a comedy/horror sequel where we battle aliens with super soakers and water balloons.Some things I just don't understand:1. Aliens are harvesting people. So they send ships to major cities where there are LOTS of people. However, they also send a ship or two or however many to BUMSTEAD, PA to harvest the 8 people who live there? What?2. Aliens melt when water is on them, yet they're harvesting humans who possess absurd amounts of water in their bodies, can SPIT onto them as a weapon, and live on a planet consisting of 70% water. I don't know, but if I'm a human, and I want to invade a planet, I'm not choosing the one that has huge seas of hydrochloric acid, and who's inhabitants spit, and drip acid out of every pore. Not even if their bones are made from gold.3. They have the insanely powerful ship technology, but can't seem to get in or out of a wooden pantry that I could easily break through? Sure...I get it...they are so highly evolved that physical exertion is thousands of years back in their evolution. Yet they can run faster than us and jump up onto buildings. Which would explain the poison-gas wrist-thingies, right? I mean...that's logical, that makes sense.4. A farmer in the middle of PA, who farms corn, doesn't have a single firearm in the house? Or a stash? Even if he is a preacher, I find it absurd. I mean, I read Preacher. Jesse Custer carries shotguns and rifles and pistols frequently, and knows how to use them. Lame.5. M. Night Shyamalamnammanmnqyana has lost a lot of weight. He looked like your average everyday guy in this one, and in Sixth Sense, he looked all chubby and fat. But he plays a Doctor in one, and a Vet in the other...weird...some bizarre medical fetish, I suppose.Don't waste your time on this drivle and don't try to convince yourself that he's a genius. he's just playing up to America's post 9-11 ""Faith is everything"" crap.",Signs
679,spingy,I love this movie BUT I do still have a problem with the ending,8,21 March 2020,"Everyone is saying that ""oh y did they go to Earth if they don't like water?"" They didn't know what water was so how would they know if they could come to Earth!! For me it's just that I was annoyed at how not so good the cgi was (personally I wish they used practical effects). The reason I give it a 9 is because the dinner scene and the disturbing footage scene is probably some of the scariest stuff I've ever seen. And genuinely I think the rest of the movie is really scary and really funny and VERY VERY well directed.",Signs
680,mafiahitman,Shyamalan's 1st Grade Writing Project.,2,14 August 2002,"First off, there will be SPOILERS in this.I'm going to use a sort of rating system that I haven't quite seen yet. 1-10, though.PLOT:  (3)  Aliens.  Oh no!  Wait a minute, that really has nothing to do with the story.  This story is about Gibson's character finding God... again.  When I saw the previews to this, and even in the first half hour of this movie, that isn't what I was expecting to see.  MUSIC:  (2)  The theme song, which was pretty much all the music, sets the mood with scary string music, but then goes into some upbeat garbage that really upset me the 5th time they used it.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:  (0)  Where I have the most quarrels.  The ONLY character development was on the part of Gibson's character.  All other characters could have been replaced by almost completely different people. The brother could have been a boxer, a lumberjack, a gymnast, most anything. See the axe on the wall, swing.  See the picture of you as a boxer on the wall, swing.  See the pipe on the ceiling, swing.  The son could have been much older, a female, a friend, as long as he had asthma.  And, as an asthma sufferer myself, I find it sad that a father would force his seemingly bad asthmatic child to live on a farm.  The daughter could have been anyone who didn't like the taste of country tapwater.  Who does, anyway?  I don't even want to know why Shyamalan decided to appear as a bad actor.CONCLUSION:  (0)  Wow.  Pretty much what Shyamalan did was give himself a memo that said ""Write a movie with a lot of build up, anticlimax, lots of stars, where there's a sick boy, a washed up athlete and a disbelieving priest,"" and then he saw an episode (bad episode) of the X-Files.  What he did in the 6th sense was great.  He started with a theme and built FROM it. In this case, he built AROUND it.  FOR it.  It was really sad to watch.  The aliens (which I've barely mentioned) were explained in less than 2 minutes of dialogue, and that goes for the appearance and disappearance of them.  To think that aliens allergic to water would come to EARTH, a planet that would probably in reality have enough water vapor in the air to harm the aliens, to harvest people made mostly of WATER, only to run away because they'd been attacked with (what we assume the rest were attacked with at least)..... water.  The idea that we can fend off aliens with waterguns just made me want to cry.Terrible movie.  I'm beginning to think Unbreakable was better than this...",Signs
681,pzylik,Not quite what I was expecting,7,7 August 2002,"The hype and the trailers seemed to hint at something more than what the movie actually offered.  Gibson and Phoenix did a great job, as did the children.  I wasn't satisfied with the story.  I was expecting something along the lines of ""interpret the signs, it's a code, here are answers to your biggest questions about life and the universe.""  The acting was great, the whole emotional thing going on in the family really added a lot to the story.  Great acting and suspense, but in general I was disappointed with the story.",Signs
682,TSFive,An instant classic...,8,15 August 2002,"I have just returned from seeing Signs for the second time, and it is getting to the point where it's initial frightening quality wears off and it makes me think and enjoy it for the classic that it is, and it registers as one of the best horror/thriller films of all time. It ranks for me with the likes of JAWS and The Shining, proving yet again that it's what you can't see that scares you. This is Shyamalan's best work yet, although I have not seen Unbreakable, I'm sure this was better. Anyways, the scares and moments it gives you are so intense, and so breathtaking that it will sweep you right into it's wonderfully written gem of a movie. Shyamalan creates characters that you get to know, love, and care about, and you feel all their emotions along with them all the way. I became pretty sad as the characters did, and happy along with them. This movie is one of the best horror films in existence, and you would be doing yourself a disservice to not see it or listen to any other person that says it's anything other than a masterpiece...",Signs
683,ubbu2002,What's your point of view? (Spoiler Warning),8,16 August 2002,"Overall, I think Signs is a great movie.  But, there are a some of minor points to consider:A.)  There is definitely a great dispute over what the aliens should have looked like, but the argument is futile because of point B.  Also, this is primarily a horror movie. The fact that it contains sci-fi elements is secondary. B.)  This is a movie about faith, NOT alien invasion or crop circles.  The crop circles are just a sign of aliens invading, and the alien invasion is just a diversion from the main theme.  Thus, for people to argue about how absurd and unbelievable the aliens were is beside the point.  Moreover, if the aliens were reasonable or believable, they would NOT be as scary.C.)  The movie is all about suspense and build-up.  The plot is secondary. Think about the plot of Sixth Sense, about a boy who sees ghosts and finally overcomes his fear.  This movie is about man's triumph over evil.  It is about a man who has lost his faith, who finds reason to believe again.D.)  For people who enjoy really scary theme-park roller-coaster rides, this movie will not be scary, it will be a joke.  So, if you fall in this category, you should not go to the theaters expecting a scary movie. Instead, rent the exorcist.I have to disagree with people who say that this movie does not fall into any genre.  I think it has elements of many genres: drama, sci-fi, horror, suspense.  There are enough funny scenes to make some people think that this is a comedy.  However, what you consider it to be, depends on your point of view.  For me, it was a good drama.So after having said all that, I'd give Signs at least a 3/4 stars in my book.  Not only did I like the ending, but I thought it was great.  (I might be in the minority here).  I thought the last 20 mins of the movie were the best.  When I walked out of the theater, I was satisfied that I had seen a good movie.",Signs
684,EddieMink,"Ruined by an unfeasibly poor Mel Gibson ""performance""",6,9 September 2002,"Right, lets get this straight; M Night Shyamalan is a fantastic film maker. He is subtle, clearly has respect for his audience, and tells stories that are always deeply rooted in exploring the potential realism of the work of a fantastical imagination. There is nobody like him currently working in the business. His work deserves to be celebrated. 'Signs' is no different. But, it is kept back from greatness by perhaps its greatest (financial) asset; Mel Gibson. While Joaquin Phoenix is truly excellent in the film, Gibson is overwhelmingly poor. And therein lies the problem. Phoenix is an actor and Gibson is a movie star. His performance (as a priest struggling with his faith no less) was abominable. He still walked, talked and acted as if he was supposed to be a hero. Not a man trying to come to terms with his ethical and religious decisions. He merely toned himself down. And left us with far too many pregnant silences which hinted at a pretension that simply wasn't there. The man cannot act. Its that simple. And this was truly a shame, because there was so much to admire about this film. The ending was overly hokey, but as far as flaws go, thats it. The film was expertly crafted, fascinating, and all of the performances shone brightly. Bar you know who.Such a shame!",Signs

Frankly, the aliens were not that frightening in my opinion and I am still a little disappointed that I never fully understood what the purpose of the aliens in ""Signs"" was.  I give this movie a 7/10.",Signs
686,MrP823,An Outstanding and Thoughtful Thriller,10,5 January 2003,"""Signs"" is in my opinion the best film of 2002 and should be strongly considered as Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards. M. Night Shyamalan has provided us with one of the scariest thrillers to come out of Hollywood in a very long time. There is an incredible amount of tension that is built up throughout the movie as well as an interesting subplot that becomes beautifully integrated with the main storyline. What really caught my attention and my admiration about this film is the fact that the story is really about a family. The unusual formations that are found in the family's corn field and the sightings of unexplained phenomenon that follow are all taken more or less from the perspective of Mel Gibson's character, his brother, and his children. Unlike a similar scenario that we see in 1996's Independence Day, Gibson and his family are not out to save the world. As matter of fact, there isn't much they can do about what is happening around them. Shyamalan wisely chooses to keep the setting in a small, farm town community and aside from what the family members view on television, the audience is forced to share in the same unsettling feeling of intense isolation that the characters are faced with. Obviously Shyamalan has studied Mr. Hitchcock very extensively (in particular 1963's The Birds) which is of a great advantage to him. It isn't often that I become truly scared at a movie, but this one tapped into an old formula that will never grow old and should be viewed as a true classic in the years ahead. It's a fantastic movie experience that blends drama with the backdrop a sci/fi horror story. Even the film's message, which becomes very clear at the conclusion, makes perfect sense and is wonderfully optimistic. Emphasizing the importance of this family's faith and love over all else. This is a good one and you owe to yourself to make sure that you see it.",Signs

First, most people wouldn't know a good movie if it fell on them.  Second, Mel Gibson's carreer is on the skids.  Thirdly, aliens are no longer scary.  There was no suspense to this film.  Only one pitiful little plot device.  There was no fright, no terror.  The aliens could be beaten by a washed up baseball player and couldn't fight their way out of a locked pantry!!!

688,Bmore1984,Greatest ending in film history,10,17 October 2012,"One of the greatest and most intellectual endings in film history. A typical moviegoers' initial reaction may be dissatisfaction as the film will not deliver the shock and frights expected from the horror genre or the dynamic explosions expected in modern adventure flicks. This film is special, however, because it fits neither of those molds, providing instead a compelling narrative and moral lesson that sustains the film long after its credits roll. Don't get me wrong, there are aliens in this film and some real moments of suspense. But if you come out of this film only concerned about the special effects, then you've missed the point. In the end, this film is less about the grotesque monsters than the internal demons stalking the protagonist and his family.",Signs
689,MrSharma,A pretty decent flick...,8,17 January 2006,"With an increasing fan base and a seemingly inherent penchant for making pictures that arouse discussion (whether it be positive or negative), M.Night Shyamalan seems to be making quite a name for himself in the Hollywood sphere and is well on his way to becoming one of the greatest directors in history. Not to say he's there yet, but in ten years or so, I truly believe that this man's soft directorial style will be considered genius and his uniqueness for suspense will be rated and compared to that of the master himself - Alfred Hitchcock.""Signs"" is a story about a fractured family's reponse to a bunch of mysterious crop circles that begin to enclose their small farm-house in a remote village on the outskirts of Philadelphia. The film progresses as crop circles begin to appear all across the world, spreading mass panic amongst the populations and indicating an extra-terrestrial threat who's intentions are anything but benevolent. Mel Gibson is excellent in his title role, and Joaquin Pheonix's brilliance shines through as always. Further credit goes to the two main children in the movie - one of whom is a future klidden Rory Culkin - who provide a sense of fear throughout the picture and allow a constant reminder of stakes.The film itself is pretty decent, serving up the suspense that we've grown to accept as the trademark style of Shyamalan himself, in his soft and elegant directorial style that has garnered critical acclaim for both this film and, especially, the Sixth Sense. And in its direction, Signs never falls short. For a fairly inexperienced mainstream director, Shyamalan has an immensely strong grasp over the medium and portrays this through his ability to direct both the actors and the action on screen. Once again, his choice of elegance in the most suspenseful and shocking of scenes is brilliant and strikes many different chords at once - surely a quality that raises him above many other directors who have attempted the genre.The cinematography and the editing also serve their purposes in the ultimate aim also - suspense - however, it is within a slightly patchy script that this film falls short. To be honest, it seems that Shyamalan's enthusiasm for directing the film was for more substantial than the enthusiasm he exuberated when writing the screenplay. For one, everything happens too fast. Whereas his other films have allowed it to play out a little longer, and let the crux of the story take as much time as the characters demand, the crucial parts of this film remain a bit too rushed. Perhaps more alien encounters would have dampened the suspense of the ""what's gonna happen now"" factor, however I still feel that despite all the film's other allusions to faith, fate and God (which were tied in rather nicely), we wanted to see just a little bit more of some of the good stuff - not the sappy stuff. That would have made the film perfect, but in the end we are left with what could have been as good as the Sixth Sense or any Hitchcockian thriller, but its in its steadfast simplicity in alien encounters that the film falls short. And don't misinterpret it, as I am fully aware that at certain points the alien aspect is deliberately overshadowed by the theological elements of Gibson's loss of faith and his hatred of God, but I still feel we could have been shown more.And I wish we were...",Signs

691,manolescucrazvan,One of the best horror movies,8,6 June 2020,"7/10 seems like a fair estimation for this movie, but you have to heavily balance the excellent impact on the viewer and the way the movie unfolds. Given that, it should easily have 8/10.What I feel Signs did excellently (and that a lot of modern horror movies fail at) is establish a baseline of normality. They show characters going about their usual lives, with nothing out of the ordinary. The story and associated tension develops slowly and naturally. It's almost boring.Some shallow evidence of a weird phenomena are showed, but there is no killer to jump out in the bathroom while one of the side-characters is taking a shower. There is no screaming and no blood. Just a faint feeling of something being wrong.By the time the first aliens are shown, you are legitimately startled. This is precisely because you're not used to it. If the first 10 minutes of the movie would have shown a non-human claw or spaceship hovering about Earth, that surprise would have been completely eradicated.Most horror movies should take notes from how Signs was constructed and what it really takes to build up a scare.",Signs

694,TheJudge-2,Don't Believe The Hype - Especially Not Your Own,1,9 February 2003,"*** Possible Spoilers Ahead ***I was originally sad to have missed this movie in the theatres, because I had heard good things about it. So it was with anticipation that I rented the DVD and settled back for a good evening's viewing... ...Ooops!I always start by trying to say something nice about a film, because almost no movie is universally bad. Well, ""Signs"" is extremely well-shot, with production design and camera work combining seamlessly to evoke a sense of atmosphere and growing panic - hats off to Tak Fujimoto. The casting and acting are good too - Mel does a classically Gibson good job of creating the role of the self-doubting agonised ex-Father father, Joaquin Phoenix provides a good foil as his ingenuous brother, and both child actors are convincing and endearing, their performances realistic enough to engage your sympathies.Sadly, that's as far as it goes. I started to worry as soon as I saw that M Night Shyamalan, not satisfied with writing *and* directing the movie, had decided to shove himself in front of the camera too, in his role as the hapless killer of Mrs. Mel. Bad move, M Night. You're no actor, but worse still in one stroke you evaporated my suspension of disbelief - I'm instantly asking myself ""Good grief - it's the director! why the Heck does he feel the need to be on screen?"" This totally smacked of self-indulgence and a nasty little suspicion of self-publicising arrogance. It's almost as if, after just three movies, M Night has decided that he deserves a Hitchcock-esque cameo performance in his forthcoming movies as some sort of signature - except he picks out a role for himself that is way larger than incidental.And destroying the suspension of disbelief is what this movie achieves effortlessly as the action progresses. Forget the obvious borrowings from at numerous other mainline sci-fi sources - M Night would probably call these deliberate ""hommages"", and frankly it helps pass the time to pick these out. You'll find Night Of The Living Dead, Independence Day, Day Of The Triffids, War Of The Worlds at the very least and there's more. This however is not the problem. It's the gaping plot holes, the sheer stupidity of the actions of both people and aliens in the context that's been created for them. To highlight just a couple out of countless - aliens capable of interstellar travel being unable to get past a flimsy wooden door? Those same ultra-genius aliens not realising that perhaps bringing an umbrella along with a crowbar might be a good idea?? Mel deciding not to bother calling the authorities to alert them there's a trapped alien in his neighbour's pantry, and for him to just go on home instead??? I couldn't avoid hearing leaden clang after clang as these incongruities kept smacking me between the eyes.I also scowl at the massively misrepresented marketing of ""Signs"" - it simply cannot be a movie about alien invasion, because it's so threadbare of plot, so it *must* therefore be a contrived vehicle about one man's loss and subsequent regaining of his faith, although the massively laboured and contrived series of coincidences in the movie - the fortuitously half-full water glasses left around, the precognitive message from the dying wife, the well-timed asthma attack - would be enough to turn the most rabid atheist back to God. Who needs faith in those circumstances, because blatant proof is being rubbed in your face.In summary, my central criticism of ""Signs"" remains the way in which we the audience are implicitly patronised as being stupid. You can almost hear the thought process -  ""Give the poor fools enough style and atmosphere and they'll not even notice the fact that there's no sense in the plot.""  Don't believe your own hype, M Night. Sure, ""Sixth Sense"" was a good movie, though less original and far less ""shockingly twisted at the end"" than the media would have had us believe, but ""Unbreakable"" was no more than poor to average. ""Signs"" has its good points, but never presume you can get your audience to swallow everything. Yes, we like style and love atmosphere, but sorry, if you're going to set up a narrative context - and remember you wrote the story too - then we need even vaguely convincing plot too. Sorry, but we as viewers deserve better than this.Four out of Ten - and that's for cinematography.",Signs
695,Harry-57,Pretty Good Movie,8,4 August 2002,"I enjoyed ""Signs"" for the most part.  It reminded me of what ""The Blair Witch Project"" tried to do, except this movie did a better job at reaching that goal.  I don't think ""Signs"" was all that expensive to make -- the story did not require any special effects or major sets -- so it is a great example of a fairly inexpensive movie that succeeds due to good writing, acting, camera work, and direction.  I liked how it told a story of an event that involved billions of people, yet did so by focusing only on a few people and showing how a major world event affected them personally. 
It is not a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, though.  It would play just as well as a rental, and it might even work better as a film you watch with one or two others in a dark house as opposed to watching it with one or two hundred others in a theatre.  The ""twist"" at the end was ok, but it wasn't anywhere near as great as the one in ""The Sixth Sense,"" another of M. Night Shyamalan's films.  Also, I wished that more was told about what was going on around the world. Events from around the globe were shown via television broadcasts that Mel Gibson and company watched as things progressed, and this technique worked very well.  The lack of information on that subject was, of course, intentional, since it added to the tension, but I still wanted to learn more about the extraordinary events that had to have been occurring off-screen. Maybe the DVD will add a few more scenes in that regard.",Signs

Night Shamalyan to try to elevate himself to status of Hitchkock (I can't believe this bombastic dork has a gall to compare himself to Spielberg: in the ""Signs"" special that run on 8/4/02). The beginning credits already spoil the movie by having a very loud, scary, dramatic score overlay. This movie startles, but doesn't scare. It creates tension, but only for a few seconds at a time. What I see as a biggest problem with the movie is a horribly wasted opportunity to make a good movie. The ""War of the Worlds"" theme is one of the grandest mistakes I have seen in movie making in the last decade. The director (please retire already: I'm sure you're rich enough) jumps right into the brainless Hollywood mainstream of ""bigger is better"" mantra. Wouldn't the movie been so much better if we didn't get this idiotic ""alien invasion"" storyline? I would have been much happier to simply see Mel Gibson being chased by aliens... because they like his corn or something.Writer, director, actor and producer? Enough is enough. Even George Lucas has gotten help with his writing after ""Phantom Menace"" was criticized. And as for M. Night's acting... let's just say that Madonna has a leg up on him in the skill department.3/10 overall, 1/10 story, 6/10 acting (but not M. Night's)",Signs
697,JackD-3,Holes in the plot -- SPOILER INCLUDED!!!!,6,7 August 2002,"SPOILER WARNING: There are plot details discussed in this comment so please don't read it if you haven't seen the movie yet.  I enjoyed watching this movie, but once it was over I was annoyed at some enormous holes in the plot.  The most obvious gaping hole is that the aliens could be destroyed by water.  Don't you think that if they had the intelligence to send fleets of ships through light years of space they would have known to wear some type of protective covering on earth with its water laden atmosphere?  These creatures would be killed every time it rained. For us it would be like going to a planet where the rain is a powerful acid instead of water.  We would wear some type of protective clothing.  These aliens wouldn't even have been able to run through the corn field at night because at night in the summer the corn stalks would often be covered with dew.  Another hole:  the aliens made these giant signs in the corn fields which people suspect (correctly as it turns out) are aids to navigation.  First of all, you would have trouble seeing them from space, especially if it's night on the ground.  Second, don't you think the aliens would have some better form of technology to navigate the earth's surface?  And most important, wouldn't some bright person have gotten the idea to mow the fields where the signs had been carved to erase the signs?  Another hole:  the neighbor (played by the director) catches an alien and locks it in the pantry.  Mel Gibson knows it's there because he cuts its fingers off.  Shouldn't one of these guys have mentioned this to somebody like maybe the police or the military?  Said something like ""There's a spaceman in the kitchen""?  Instead the neighbor drives off to the lake and Mel runs home and boards up the windows.  That just doesn't make any sense to me.  Like I said, while the movie was playing I really enjoyed it because the performances are uniformly strong and there are some wonderful moments of suspense and humor.  But afterward I just felt annoyed.",Signs

Here we are left with a movie that lacks consistency within its own logic, that in fact insults its viewers by expecting them to buy into what thin logic it does have.  Primarily being a family melodrama, the first and biggest failing of this film is to have no well-crafted characters to care about.  Everything here is made out of cardboard or paper (to give some sense of weight to how the denser material compares).  People are so desperate for actual content in their films that they are lauding this one as a movie that makes you think.

Signs is an extremly wellwritten story and very wonderfully shot.   M. Night Shyamalan is notthe most amazing director, but he is by far the most amazing storyteller of our time.  Watching one of his movies is like listening toyour grandmother slowly reading a bedtime fairy-tale to you andletting your imagination run away with the concepts.  It mightsound corny, but it's true.  None of his films are big on gloriousspecial effects or awesome action sequences... they are all basedupon a genuine flow of story.  The ambiance Shyamalan createsis so perfectly eerie that it reinforces my strong belief that its whatyou DONT see that's scary.  Also, I think that the young actresswho played Bo stole the show...

707,vinzclortho,Another gem from Shyamalan,9,25 August 2002,"Signs was a terrific, spooky, intelligent thriller that can stand aside M. Night Shymalan's previous classic The Sixth Sense. I won't give major points of the story of Signs away, going in with little expectations for this film is a good thing. The movie goes at it's own pace (much the way Sixth Sense did) building the proper tension with use of visuals and sound design. I was on the edge of my seat watching this film, it was a creepy spook fest, emulating such classics as Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and Night Of The Living Dead. I was truly amazed at how excellent Signs was. Mel Gibson was great in his role as a troubled Priest and family man who is the center of the film. He gives a very commanding performance, one of his best. The film also contains just the right amount of humor to keep the nails from your finger being completely chewed off. This is the MUST SEE film of the summer of 2002. Not only has M. Night Shyamalan made one of the year's best films, but he also officially solidified himself as one of the best film-making talents around today!",Signs

There's a scene of a birthday party shot on a home video camera that I will never forget and is one of the creepiest things I could ever witness in my entire life. During the first twenty minutes of the movie, I thought everything in it was so weird and confusing, but this story weaves itself together so perfectly that it makes you just be in awe of M.

710,blaisepascal,"SCARY, predictable, but TOO SCARY TO MATTER!!",9,3 August 2002,"I'm utterly shocked at how many bad reviews this masterpiece of horror received on this web page. I have honestly never been so scared by a movie in my life as I was by Signs. Maybe this is because I've always been very afraid of and interested in aliens, but I think a good deal of it was simply because this is a VERY scary movie. I didn't really have any expectations going into the theater, and knew next to nothing about the film, and came out afraid to go to sleep that night.Yes, the direction of the movie is fairly predictable and the ending is flat out on the cheesy side. This still doesn't change the fact that I think it was all done very well, and it still scared me to death! How the director scared you with what you didn't see, psychologically and with shadows and the soundtrack, was just masterful. What a mood setting soundtrack.The acting ranged from amazing (the younger Caulkin brother) to very good (Gibson). Every one of the four main characters is well developed and acted in a very convincing way.My first instinct was to give this movie a 8. If I liked the movie so much, you might wonder why I wouldn't give it a 9 or 10? Well I saw it was some friends, and a few really didn't like it. Afterwards they bashed the ending especially, which I admit is the weak point of the movie. My conversation with them about the movie honestly convinced me that the movie was worse than I think it really was was. Then as I clicked on the number 8, I thought about how I felt before I talked to them, right as the movie ended. I thought about how the movie made me scream out loud, jump, and honestly want to leave the theater half way through because my heart felt it would burst in my chest. I thought about how the acting, direction, soundtrack, etc were all amazing. Then I thought about how when I saw the ending, I just thought ""that could have been better"", not ""that really hurt the movie"". The fact remains that this is the scariest movie I've ever seen, and it's a great movie aside from the horror as well. So in the end, I give Signs a 9/10.",Signs

His script is also amazing as the lines delivered by the actors are very believable and realistic.  The supernatural and science fiction look of the film are only the surface.  Beneath is a realistic story of a loving family.  Shyamalan shows his mastery of film making by blending scary, sad and humorous to create a real life environment on film.  The story may seem like it forshadows a lot, but that is done on purpose.  Shyamalan duplicates a lot of scenes from classic horror films.  He seems to be showing that he respects these films, but he is also trying to tell us that this is his original take on the horror alien movie.  The special effects are perfect and utilized in just the right way.  The actors are also amazing.  Mel Gibson is back in great form, playing the somewhat reserved father and minister perfectly.  Joaquin Phoenix is also good and shows a knack for comedic talent as his character is a mix of many different emotions.  The children were wonderful and hopefully continue to act in films in the footsteps of Haley Joel Osment.  Rory Culkin was wonderful and shows a true talent.  Abigail Breslin gives a wonderful performance and was as convincing as any veteran actor.  I give this film a 9 out of 10.  It is a great film and a sign that Shyamalan will be with us for a long time.",Signs
713,devon_chris,Wonderfully crafted piece on shifty premise,8,25 September 2002,"It's only after walking away from the cinema, right before drafting this review, that i did as much as cast my mind over the actual plot of 'Signs'. If you do the same after seeing it, you'll realise that the story (and even, tragically, the ending) come straight out of a 50s B-movie. The script is captivating, but nevertheless falls victim to that other big hollywood temptation - to be disgustingly slushy. Sometimes you just wish they'd all grow up and face certain annihilation like real brain-dead action heroes rather than the well-acted, well-knitted characters they actually are. In fact, to niggle over such trivial details such as the entire plot and entire script would, amazingly, be to detract from just what a great film this is. Offsetting the disappointingly simple plot and could-see-it-from-a-mile-off-ending (though this may be unfair; after all, when i watched Sixth Sense, Shyamalan's best film previously, I figured out the twist in the end within the first few minutes; thousands others didn't, so there you go - i'm just petty) are some good interjections of wry humour in the screenplay, and marvellous cinematography and musical score throughout. This director, I believe, is starting to make a name for himself as THE ultimate atmosphere-builder, essentially the sort of director Hitchcock would be now were he to have access to the same standard of FX (Shyamalan clearly aspires to this standard - the trademark device of images reflected in TV sets, and the presently encouraging use of himself as a character, show indications of this admiration). What separates these two great directors at the moment, though, is that Hitchcock picked good scripts and good intriguing stories, and at the end of the day there is nothing vaguely innovative about this film. What makes it so worth watching is the sheer, permanent tension of the movie - if anything, a bit too heavy; the audience needs a break occasionally - but as it happens I think this overwhelming atmosphere puts you right there with the feelings of the characters Shyamalan is portraying to us. 'Signs' is awesome. Go and see it if you want your breath taken away, but only if you don't mind a pretty lame conclusion to the storyline, and if you don't mind seeing more emotional outpourings than is really necessary. All the same, well worth my four quid.",Signs
714,JT-Saint,Lost Faith,1,20 August 2002,"It's all about faith, right? Well slap me around the face with a dead halibut!Shyamalan brings us a mildly interesting film about the reaffirmation of faith of a man who has lost it after the death of his wife, packaged as an alien/crop circle movie.SPOILERS..Although elements of the film were indeed well crafted and filmed, it seemed a shame that the director felt it necessary to 'hammer-home' his concept of faith and belief that 'things happen for a reason'. The issues of faith were much better dealt with in films like Contact and not as tidily resolved or telegraphed as they were in Signs. Many have critisized the alien element of the film and have been berated for not looking past the invasion and concentrating on the main 'faith' theme. The problem that arises when you're developing a story that contains serious issues, like fate and faith, is if you surround it with inconsistancies and implausabilities (no matter how improbable the scenario is), it loses alot of it's impact.The acting in the film is commendable and even M.Night does a reasonable job (with his hydrophobic (yes, again) prophecy) and the story moves on at a reasonable pace. That is, until towards the end. Subtlety is thrown out of the window in favour of childlike story-telling and your left feeling that a good film (certainly amongst this months fare) becomes completely average.I for one, feel too many people are quick to applaud the works of certain directors (especially those that share their name) and not judge a film soley on it's merits. Based on it's merits, this is a wholly average film.Oh and by the way, the Hitchcock associations end with the opening credits!",Signs

717,ThingyBlahBlah3,The Truth Isn't Out There - SPOILERS,8,23 July 2003,"When I saw the trailers for this, I was really excited to see it. I expected a smarter, scarier ""Independence Day."" When it came out, my sister saw it first, and she wasted no time in tearing it to shreds, telling me how stupid and boring it was. End result: I waited to rent it instead, and recently sat down to watch it with no expectations at all (probably the best way to watch any movie).I thought it was terrific. Since I wasn't expecting another Alien Invasion action flick, I could settle in and accept the alien subplot for what it was: a plot device designed to give Graham a chance to reexamine his lost faith and reconnect with his family. While the nighttime chase through the cornfield was tense and the Brazilian party video was really disturbing, the two most gripping scenes were both quiet conversations: Graham & Merrill's discussion on coincidence/luck vs the divine plan, and the dinner scene where the wall between Graham and his kids finally comes down (this scene is played perfectly by everyone).And, to refute what some others have written here, I didn't see the ""faith vs luck"" thing as being explicitly pro-religion. All he's saying is that if you believe in a higher power, then it's easier to build a happy life for yourself. But you can doubt and still be happy; it's just harder to live with the fear that you're alone in the universe. In the end, it's not religious faith or the Benevolent Hand Of God that saves the Hess family from the aliens; it's the fact that they're a strong family that looks out for each other.People have complained about the ""flat"" acting, which seems to me to have been intentional. In a nice change of pace, Mel Gibson gives an atypically quiet performance; those used to seeing him goofing around in the Lethal Weapon movies might be disappointed. Joaquim Phoenix continues to develop into a rock-solid character actor (watch him reacting to what he sees on TV & in every scene he's got with the kids), and the bond between the brothers was deeply felt, as well as the void in the family. Both of the children were excellent; Shymalan has a real gift for casting and working with child actors.A few words about the aliens, since so many viewers wrote in to share their disbelief about the way they behave. It's never confirmed that the crop circles are for navigation. That's just what the reporters are speculating. The crop circles could have religious meaning to the aliens, or maybe that's how they mark their territory. Maybe it's just psychological warfare, designed to confuse us and distract us from the other things they're doing.It's also never confirmed that they need us as a food source. Indeed, if water is lethal to them (see below on that), we'd be the worst thing for them to eat (we're 80% water!). Maybe they view us as a threat and this is a pre-emptive strike. Who knows, maybe they only mate once every 30,000 years and human bodies play a role in it.And here's another theory: maybe the universe is full of alien races, and we were lucky to be invaded by one of the less-intelligent species. It's possible that in all their explorations, they never encountered water or doorknobs before coming to earth. And why are there aliens randomly sneaking around Pennsylvania farmhouses and Brazilian birthday parties? Because they're idiots. Maybe Shyamalan was having fun with the accepted wisdom that the alien invaders would naturally have to be much smarter than we are.If you can drop your expectations and accept that this is a movie about one man coming to grips with God, finding his lost faith, and repairing the wounds in his family, and that the aliens are just a means to that end, then you'll probably get something out of it. If not, then you should probably watch ""Aliens"" or ""Predator"" again instead.",Signs
718,cmarcuslyons,Brilliant and Hitchcockian!,10,26 January 2003,"M. Night Shyamalan has crafted a brilliant and wonderful film in ""Signs"". Dare I say that with this specific film he's reached Hitchcockian levels in his writing and directing, and that's no small feat.  ***Reading Further May Spoil The Plot***I dragged my heels in seeing this, thinking ""oh great, yet ANOTHER cliched movie about crop circles.""  From the opening credits to the very last moment, Shyamalan creates an atmospheric and thrilling masterpiece.  Casting Mel Gibson in the lead could've been a huge mistake, but under the artful eye of the director, Gibson gives a nuanced and understated performance as a damaged and faithless former priest.  Joaquin Phoenix as his brother was a casting coup, as Phoenix never fails to give a wonderfully believable performance.  That Phoenix brings a stunning resolution to the plot was another piece of brilliant decision-making.  Exploring the possibilities of alien visitation on earth, Shyamalan manages to subtly portray one possible outcome of such an event without rubbing it in our faces.  Taking his time to unravel the story works well, allowing the viewer to be drawn in in every way.  As Hitchcock also teased his audience with what was to come, Shyamalan uses several techniques to good effect.

Fans of Night's work, (Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense), will really like Signs. 
Mel Gibson, in my opinion really stretches as an actor, and is supported by a good cast.  And although you never really leave Mel's world, you get a sense of a larger world view with the story.

However, the majority of criticisms are based on things WE know; not on things that the aliens may (or may not) know. Maybe the aliens can't stand something chemical in TREATED water. Did anyone consider the fact that fluoride may be the deadly component? Perhaps they've never even SEEN a wooden door before, let alone housing such as ours; and tend not to break doors down because they don't know what lies beyond them. And we have no idea what they may actually want human bodies for ...so what if humans are made out of water, perhaps they extract enzymes or something.Taking these things into consideration, it's a bit easier to suspend one's disbelief. Plus, I'm an atheist and even I didn't mind the spiritual tie-in to the movie's plot line.

724,FilmFanAndReviewer003,Shyamalan's Best Film To Date,10,20 July 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan has a knack for making some really good movies and some really bad movies. Although ""The Sixth Sense"" was a very entertaining thriller, M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" is overall a better film, and it could be one of the best alien films of all time.Graham Hess lives with his two children and his brother on a farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. As if losing his wife in a car accident wasn't enough devastation for his family, they are told that the strange formations being found in their crop circles are the work of aliens, looking to invade our planet. Although skeptical at first, Graham slowly figures out that the world really is being invaded, and that he and his family could very well be near their deaths....The film wastes no time in getting the story started. Less than five minutes into the movie, the crop circles are already there and the authorities are notified. Yet the film still manages to spend enough time with the characters for us to get to know them well and for us to really care about them. Shymalan proves that he is a master at keeping the tension going throughout the whole film, even when its pitch-black or dead-silent. He even manages to add in some pretty funny moments to the film. The acting is generally well-done, from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix to even the child actors.Some people are not going to like the film's ending, for whatever reason. Some may not like the fact that we actually get to see the aliens at point-blank range, while others may not like the aliens' weakness. I feel a little bit of both, but they're very minor things when looking at the film as a whole.""Signs"" is probably the best alien film I have ever seen (apart from ""Men In Black""), and is so close to being a four-star film in my book. Its one of the few films I have ever seen (probably the only one) that has actually terrified me just because of its realism. Everything about it is just that close to perfection. Its not an alien movie just for science-fiction fans, its a high-stakes drama for anyone.Rating: ***1/2 P.S. When the newscaster on the television says that the footage may be disturbing, believe her.",Signs
725,hashemoon22,Signs...Great movie,10,3 February 2007,"Signs is one of M.night Shyamalan's best movies that i've ever seen,it discusses the whole theory of extra terrestrials but with a wide concept and the movie is mainly based on Mel Gibson and his family...Mel Gibson's acting was excellent in this move and so as his kids and his brother, the whole family we're in perfect roles and they all played them well... Signs is not a gruesome movie or horror movie, but u can say it's a thriller sci-fi movie that suits most thriller and sci-fi lovers.But not only was this movie filled with sci-fi and thriller but also in some parts it's a tearjerker and really moves u emotionally and makes u feel in depth with Mel Gibson's family..Signs 10/10",Signs

I say ""think I screamed"" becauseeveryone else around me was screaming so loudly that I'm not positive anysound actually came out.  I might have just gasped for air.M. Night Shyamalan is actually making me feel bad as a video producer. Whenever I see some hack like Michael Bay take a movie with a $140 millionbudget like ""Pearl Harbor"" and steer it into the ground, I think ""I could have trashed a movie for $140 million!""  By comparison, Shyamalan's ""Signs"" wasmade for $62 million, probably could have been made for a tenth of that if no- name actors would have been used, and was simple enough to have been shoton someone's camcorder.  Yet his knowledge of how to pull an audience'sstrings makes this the best movie of the summer.  Go see it with a big crowd.  That'll hide your screams.",Signs

The little girl of the movie (Bo) is also endearing.  I enjoyed that all of the details came together in the end without being too obvious, imho. I have talked to many people who didn't like this movie at all, but I was literally on the edge of my seat.  I was right a long with Pheonix, with his reactions to what he was seeing.  Many of those I've talked to didn't like it because he was in it, and they aren't able to get past the character he played in Gladiator.  I was impressed that he was able to give a completely different performance. I loved this one.  Obviously.",Signs
729,edwood1954,"Not Spielbergian magic, but Shyamalan spookiness",7,12 August 2002,"Audiences who go into this movie anticipating the kind of spellbinding magic of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" will come away disappointed.  What you WILL experience is a creepy, spooky story that mixes in nice doses of humor along the way.And those who see this film expecting surprise twists at the end will also be disappointed.  Shyamalan has a long career as a filmmaker ahead of him, so let's not get on his case every time he makes a movie that doesn't give you a cheap thrill at the end.The first thing you'll notice is the music on the opening credits.  Very scary, very Hitchcock.  It sets the tone for what's to come.  The plot will leave a number of open-ended questions for those who are really paying attention.  To list them here would be to spoil too many elements of the film for those who haven't seen it.  Suffice it to say that many will be scratching their heads and thinking, ""But whatever happened to...?"" or ""Why did they...?""As for Shyamalan himself, there was probably no need to fill the screen with ""A Film by M. Night Shyamalan"" at the end.  After all, the opening credits told us that (also filling the entire screen), and he cast himself into a key role in the movie.  Add to that the fact that he's appearing on major magazine and newspaper covers worldwide, and I think we're on the verge of Shyamalan overdose.  Here's the antidote:  M. Night, make your next film smaller, less grandiose, less self-indulgent, and a nice, small, classy credit saying ""Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.""  That's right, let someone else write your next movie.  It'll make for a more diverse resume.",Signs

This film brings your worst fears to life and keeps them just outside your range.  I will agree with some who say that the direction was uneven at times, but when it was on, it was right on.  Go to this one only if you're ready to be up all night.",Signs
732,mlescully,What's scary about this movie. . .,8,5 February 2003,"*Possible spoilers within* The first time I saw this film was in the theater, not long after it opened. I was so scared, I could barely move.  My muscles were honestly sore at the end from holding tension in them.  It was the best filmgoing experience. ..ever.  On the way home, I analyzed it and realized what was so frightening to me was the way it echoed my own personal 9/11 experience.  (When I found out, through the DVD extras, that filming started two days after, on September the 13th, I cried.)On that day, more concrete to me than the suffering of the people in the towers, was the fear of the people standing helpless nearby, watching the destruction.  And even more concrete than that to me was what felt like a momentary dissolution of our country, the way things are done here, and the possibility of what might come next.  I remember the most terrifying aspect of that whole day was hearing the f-word on NBC in some unedited video. ..then hearing that footage again and again and again.  Similarly in Signs, the moment that we are ""pushed off the edge,"" so to speak, is the moment that Graham opens the closet door and there's nothing but a test pattern on the television.  That moment, to me, spoke of a terrifying ""end of the world as we know it,"" similar to what I experienced on that day.  Also, when Graham and the kids come out of the basement, the first thing we hear is the television news report, a clear ""return to normalcy.""  I was put off too, once I saw the actual creature effect, but I was willing to forgive that one transgression, as the rest of the film to me was a beautifully crafted piece of cinema.  The direction and cinematography are marvellous and thoughtful, most of the actors have obviously done their homework, the light and indeed the whole production design is beautiful(as a costume designer, I loved touches like little Bo being in her dress-up gown when she is frightened).  Sure, it's got its plot holes.  Sure some bits of the dialogue aren't as well-crafted as they might be.  Ok, M Night Shayamalan isn't likely to win an Oscar for his acting.  However, if you can get beyond these little issues and see the film as a whole, give in to willing suspension of disbelief, and buy into the world of the film, I think there's a lot to be learned, both emotionally and intellectually.",Signs
733,cionex,Ham-handed and forgettable,6,4 August 2002,"After reading a few of the other comments here about _Signs_ being an intelligent film, I have to wonder if I was in the right theatre.  It was somewhat entertaining, but about as subtle as Allen Iverson's jewelry.  You get pummeled about the head and shoulders repeatedly with some of the most obvious foreshadowing ever to hit the screen, and the whole movie is pretty manipulative.If you love Wal-Mart, double-wides, and sport a mullet, this film may strike you as intelligent.  Otherwise, go in with reasonable expectations, and don't pay full price.  The acting was good, but the script and direction were extremely disappointing -- kind of like M. Night Shyamalan wants to sell Beanie Babies or Angel Figurines on QVC or something.",Signs
734,shoktart,The Perfect Example of Why I Love Movies!,10,24 August 2002,"Words cannot describe how much I loved this movie. Take a moment to forget about analyzing the suspense, acting, directing, writing, editing, and entertainment this movie has to offer, and simply ask yourself if it is possible for you to be touched by a movie in an emotional or spiritual way. If it is not possible, then feel free to go back to over-analyzing and hunched over your ego in search for so-called ""holes"" in movies that do not match-up with your own limited perception of reality.But if it is possible for movies to mean more to you than mere chopping blocks for editing and plot analysis, then I would highly recommend this movie to you.Oh, and by the way, the suspense, acting, directing, writing, editing, and pure entertainment in this movie is top notch. Combined with the message in the movie and the emotions I felt during and after the movie, ""Signs"" delivers the full package. It has everything. It is as close to perfection as I have seen in a movie my whole life. It is my new favorite movie of all-time!I liken this movie to a parable. The message behind the story in a parable is much more important and focused on than whether the story is realistic. Many people choose to look at this movie and compare what happens to the way they view reality. YOU MISS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE MOVIE IF YOU DO THAT!The point of this movie is that you have the opportunity to watch how this particular family responds to a major crisis.

736,SteveSWohlgemuth,The best of Shamyalan,8,22 September 2019,"This is one of those films that you never forget. The creep factor is just right... until the end, but that is somewhat inevitable. I believe that the best horror has to touch something deeper in us rather than just providing cheap thrills, and ""Signs"" does that nearly to perfection. We grow to love these characters and to sympathize with them. Child actors are always tough, but these kids put in nuanced and believable performances. It's also a film with a deeper message, that nothing is ever by chance and everything in our lives, even the smallest quirks, has a purpose. That's probably why some people don't like it. They prefer that their horror doesn't have an uplifting ending.
Sadly, I don't think Shamyalan ever made anything better. His recent films disappointed me because I keep hoping for another ""Signs.""",Signs
737,mrlovecraft31,the them of faith done for ages 5-7.,4,9 January 2003,"Well i just saw signs for the second time on dvd and i must say my opinion has not changed. I think it's way to simple and it's view on faith is way to simplistic and kinda dull and pandering. I like alot of how the movie is filmed though. I think it builds tension well and has some creepy and somewhat scary moments but in the end it's paper thin story just does not give much reason to care. For it to have worked as a thriller it needed to be much more dark and driven in its structure i think.M Night says he based it on ""the birds"" and ""night of the living dead"" and ""invasion of the body snatchers(1956)"", but it comes across more as ""Watcher in the woods"" but without all the thrills and violence that watcher had. You think I'm kidding but I'm not. *****Possible Spoilers***** The them of the film which seems to be the ability to regain your faith after tragic things have happened in your life  or how people keep faith in thier lives has been done much better in other films. I would say david cronenbergs movie ""CRASH"" is about how people keep faith in a world that seems devoid of things to trust or believe in. It shows this very well and in a very interesting way without lying to audience with sappy rhetoric. Speaking of which i think ""It's a wonderful life"" sappy as it is is a much better film about the same thing. It has much more character and feeling than Signs even attempts to. Also films like The addiction and Bad Lieutenant provide questions and answers about lost faith in much more honest terms. I don't know what i was supposed to get out of signs but i would much rather watch invaders from mars myself. if anyone else got something out of this more than the overly simple theme then kudos to you because i dont think the director is clever enough to put more into it and having just watched the documentary with the dvd, called making of signs, he proves my point. Lets hope Mr. Nights next film tries to explore something a bit deeper than this one did. Don't get me wrong the themes of faith and losing one's faith are deep but the way they are treated in Signs is not. A great comparison to find out what i am talking about would be to watch the other films i listed right after signs or better yet watch mike leighs ""Naked"" that should get ya thinking.",Signs

741,wilhunteye,"What is that sign ahead? It's got to be a U turn, STOP, or detour!",1,28 August 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** SIGNS: It has  got to be a U turn, STOP, or detour! On the plus side, this film did have several jump-out-and-got-ya scenes, it was in color and the dialogue was in American English. Unfortunately that's all of the plus side. We are introduced to a family still in mourning; where the Mom/Wife/Sister-in-law has been killed in a freak accident some months before. From the trauma of losing his wife Mel Gibson's character resigns his position of a community spiritual leader ( A Priest in some unnamed Faith) We soon understand that he not only doubts God, but he is actually P***ed at him. His brother, son and daughter are suffering not only because they too have lost a parent/sister-in-law, but the head of the family (Mel) has lost his spiritual conviction and love for life. It is apparent that his faith is turning dark, and he is becoming more reclusive.Enter in the Water-soluble aliens. Crop-Circles, we are lead to believe, all along have been communications for alien invasion plans. The aliens mission, IQ, and combat tactics are all found in a book purchased by Mel's eleven-year-old son, from the small Pennsylvania farm town's local bookstore, which we are informed had ordered it by mistake. (I think it was a hardbound copy of the 'Signs' Script.) From information there in contained, they all survive, the days and nights of terror that follow. For comic relief, all, but Mel, at one point don a hat of aluminum foil, which resemble twenty-pound Hershes kisses (an obvious  Pennsylvania product tie in). This is done, so the aliens can't read their thoughts, and maybe control them too. It's in the kids book, and so far it ain't been wrong. With out the poor attempt at a classic science fiction plot, this could have been rewritten as a family drama. Mel had his character down well, but those dam pesky aliens. It seems unlikely that a species of aliens would want anything to do with a planet covered with a liquid (water) that dissolves their tissue. It was tough knowing that the kids super-soaker in this `Signs' invasion, would have been like the yodeling cowboy in the movie `Mars Attacks'. `Signs' however wanted you to believe. It wanted you to believe that the Aliens, who, though super athletic, are adversely affected by light and melt from water, and run around nude for a force recon combat mission, on a hostile planet. Also, the alien's spacecraft now appearing by the thousands over the cities of earth are never met by a military response, Just a lot of looking up in wonder, and panic. While the only offensive gesture offered is the pointing of news cameras. (Anything more violent may cost more to show on screen, and they may not want to come back to earth, for a sequel.) `SIGNS' could have been an `ET' warm fuzzy type of movie, where the aliens crop signs, are made by 'alien' secret agents, living among us. The C-C in Tom's field pointed out that ` The human creatures here need solace, and a renewed faith in the Creator'. The characters would eventually discover that different signs, in various fields around the planet mean different things like; 'Help this person', `Take this one back home', `These idiots still think Crop Circles are hoaxes',  you get the idea. Maybe the priest, or one of his children, would be the only human that could read the messages, etc. The version we got was pretty worthless. Thinking they were in the 'The Birds' Tom and his brother board up windows and doors, they should have at least recalled that this was only marginally effective on five pound birds. Moreover, it doesn't even make a good waste of time here, for soon after the last nail is hammered, the family is forced in retreat to the basement shuddering in terror. The Aliens have no tools or weapons, other than a poison gas they secrete from their bodies though a tube protruding from their hand, and can use it only if they hold you down, and squirt up your nose. These space wimps attempt to get in by using the basement doorknob, or the old forgotten coal chute. They have all night, but fail to breach the inch thick basement door or the franticly stacked sacks of dog food. The next morning after surviving the night of terror, they all emerge to learn that the aliens have departed, leaving behind their injured. Mel's son is having a seizure for lack of medicine, and is grabbed up by one of the stranded invaders, and gassed. He must have been hiding in one of the many Hitchcock shadows. Gibson, a veteran of many military films, should have pointed out the flaw in any global invasion strategy which includes giving the enemy (us humans in this case), samples of it's army to study alive, or dead. The aliens are tall and skinny, at least eight feet tall; at no more than a hundred twenty pounds, and as aliens go, not that bad looking. Enter Batman. A one time local baseball hero, the 20 year old brother of Mel's character takes an enshrined Louisville slugger from the wall and kills this stranded alienated alien. Mel's character, finds faith anew when he discovers that his sons chronic asthma didn't allow him to breath the poison gas used on him, so the boy lives, and the movie concludes showing the passage of time with a winter shot of the house. All religious Icons back on the walls, Mel is once again `Father Thomas', and God is spelled once again with a capital `G'. The aliens are gone with no further mention. (and they all lived happily ever after) To me this film is a big stinker, because I could see within it, no less than three good movie ideas slamming into one another and the mutant result was what we were forced to swallow with our popcorn.",Signs
742,coolmod,all signs point to a good film....sorry bout the pun,9,30 March 2009,"Signs has a definite Hitchcock degree of scope. Characters are well rounded, tension and suspicion are kept to a peak until just the right moment, there is a story within a story and it plays into the hands of the actors. Its a definite watch at night, in the darkest room, blast the volume...not so much horror film but thriller, with horror elements.Signs follows the story of the Hess family. A single father widowed tragically when his wife is killed in a car accident and former priest. He lives with his two kids Bo and Morgan and his younger brother Meryl. the family awake one morning to find a large crop circle in the cornfield of the farm they live on. The young boy Morgan jumps to the conclusion that aliens are the cause, he's a bit of a truth is out there kid, but his ideas are discounted by the family who believe it was the local hooligans playing an elaborate prank but soon these signs start to appear in countries all over the world.the film takes a dramatic tone only really jesting at the idea of this alien invasion theory but tense edge of seat scenes throughout keep the idea fresh and believable. Its a fifties drive through movie in theory but its simple idea leads it to modern sophistication with serious story telling and some tight acting from the leads Gibson and Phoenix. All elements kept this viewer enticed and lead along. its a hard film to walk away from especially mid way through were a terrifying revelationshows up from out of the blue in the form of a news reel showing afamily party ruined by a mysterious creature, which will require a bit of time to come down from.in all honesty its an entertaining film, filled with top shelf acting and suspenseful directorial skill from M.Night.

For those of you who don't know he was the guy that hit Mel Gisbon's wife. And the scene where they were all eating pizza and going ""is that him?"" made it too obvious.Overall the movie was good. It was supsenseful and fun, UNTIL the family went into basement to hide from the aliens. The first time a flashlight got dropped and everyone screamed was scary, then it got really annoying. Especially when it took forever for the director to show that everyone was still in one piece. Yeah, he was leaving it up to the imagination, but it got old quickly!For me the movie pretty much went downhill from there. When everything wrapped up at the end it was just too calculated. The asthma, the water, the bat, ""swing away"" it was all too much. I went to see a movie about aliens, not get lectured about having faith and reading the ""Signs"" in the world around us. I don't mind happy endings, but like I said this was way too calculated for my taste and ultimately ruined a movie that i thought had lots of potential.",Signs

The movie generates a good deal of suspense and tension with humor intermixed at the appropriate times.  The story was good but a little tough to believe in some parts.

746,l_a_t_e_r_a_l_u_s,One of the best movies of 2002 so far,9,5 October 2002,"A scary-looking monster is not needed in this movie. Just simply the fear of the unknown is enough. But just in case that's not enough for YOU, you will also get creepy sounds & very frightening situations. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that some of the stuff that is on the news on the TV in the movie is some of the scariest material in the movie. While all the things on the news in this movie are pretty freaky, there is one news clip in particular that I think really scared mostly everyone (maybe everyone) in the audience. So basically, don't go to this movie expecting to see a bunch of man-killing freaky-looking aliens. If you want something like that, rent ""Alien"".All of the actors in this movie do a terrific job. The kids were great, which was unexpected for me. And as for the director...well, M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. He is the Alfred Hithcock of our time (note that he is nowhere as even remotely great as Hitchcock, I was just saying for our time). And he is now one of my favorite directors. With ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"", he manages to make movies that can truly terrify the audience, and he doesn't use blood & gore, he uses suspense and just simple horror. They are both only rated PG-13, and are both real crowd-scarers, which tells you this guy is really something.To sum it up: This is one of VERY VERY few movies that had me laughing out loud one minute, and then jumping out of my seat in shock the next. Lots of laughs, great acting, awesome directing, truly terrifying material, shock value, all the suspense you can handle and then some, what more do you want from a movie? Little kids saying the darndest things? Excellent character build-up? Drama? Well you get all of those too. ""Signs"" is one of the best movies of 2002 so far.",Signs
747,shady402,"Brilliant, suspenseful, thought-provoking film that people JUST DON'T GET!",8,25 August 2006,"'Signs' is one of Shyamalan's best movies because it is atmospheric, suspenseful and eerie from start to finish but is also a compelling tale of fate, which many people don't seem to understand.All people seem to take away from this movie is that 'water kills the aliens?!?!?!? why invade a planet that is literally made of water?, why harvest humans who are mostly made of water?' and 'how can these aliens master space travel and not be able to break down wooden pantry doors?!?!?' etc etc when in fact this has little to do with the plot.You need to look at the bigger picture. It's about the lead characters journey in the film, from having faith, to losing it, to finding it again. It revolves around the theme that everything happens for a reason (which is PRECISELY WHY the aliens who have an aversion to water invade a planet that is mostly made out of it), looking out for the 'signs' is also why the girl conveniently leaves glasses of water all over the house and why the boy has asthma as it ends up saving his life! For all those who dislike this film, just remember that it is not about the aliens. It's so much deeper than that. Shyamalan is a master storyteller but when his stories don't seem to make sense or appear to be ridiculous, look a little deeper as his themes and morals are often disguised in his intricate and visually stunning films.Beautiful, over-looked,under-rated gem. 8/10!",Signs

The cinematography is still very well done by today's standards, and the humor, suspense, and acting are all very sufficient.Shamalan does well in putting all the pieces together in order to provide a significant and satisfactory ending. All arcs of the characters were fulfilled and made me smile immensely..I did kind the alien parts kind of weak compared to the fear in response of their discovery. In hindsight, there wasn't much that was scary about them.Still very glad I watched it, and hope others take the time to give it a chance.",Signs
750,andy_krysiak,Shyamlan's Most Underrated,8,5 May 2016,"Signs is directed by M. Night Shyamalan, a name that used to mean that we are in for a real treat at the movies, considering he had brought us The Sixth Sense. Signs is probably, in my opinion, the second best M. Night Shyamalan movie, after The Sixth Sense.It tells the story of one family as they try to investigate and piece together what caused the huge signs left in their crop field, which eventually turns out to be the act of an alien invasion. That alone is a simple plot, nothing we haven't seen before, with aliens and all of that weird stuff. However, the film remarkably focuses on the moral dilemma of the family instead of just aliens blowing things up and whatnot. This allows for some great storytelling, as we get some great exploration of the emotional crisis the family is caught in the middle of.One thing this movie gets a lot of criticism for is the fact that the aliens' weakness is water, and that it makes no sense for them to travel to a world that is 70% water. My argument is that the aliens may not have known the Earth was covered in water, as surely there are other blue planets out there.The other major concern people have about this movie is the way that the two kids act. Unlike the water issue, this one does bother me a bit like the majority of people. The kids consistently say things that no normal child would say. Their language feels very out of place, when they remark things like, ""everything they wrote in science books is about to change"", or ""the water has his amoebas in it"". It's just not how 8 to 10-year-old kids talk. I have nothing against the actors, but this does become an issue after a while.Despite that criticism, Signs outshines that because of how extraordinarily creepy it is. It's simply a very riveting story that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The scares work the way they need to: they give the audience chills and allow them to crave more. It's some great cinematic work what they manage to pull off.All in all, Signs is a frightening, exciting thriller that will surely deliver the thrills.Rating: A-",Signs
751,supahz,Disappointing (Spoiler),3,19 April 2003,"Disappointing.  The majority of the film was okay, and the acting was at the high level you'd expect given the cast.  But the whole time I'm sitting here thinking ""okay, what's going to be the gimmicky ending this time?""... and it was pretty weak.  Still, anything with suspense, aliens, and Mel Gibson can't be all bad.  ""Signs"" is a good movie.  But given Night's track record and style, what you expect him to deliver simply falls short this time.The aliens were an interesting story to work with... crop circles and all... and their part of the story was quite entertaining.  The news ""footage"" of the alien at the children's party was very eerie, and the scenes in the cornfields were quite tense.  But the underlying Mel Gibson personal struggle story line was pretty weak... a disillusioned priest who in the end returns to God because of the alien incursion.  Right.  Nevermind that an actual alien incursion would turn the bible on its ear and toss most of it out of the window.And the ""zinger"" at the end was laughably weak... junior is saved from the alien poison gas because he has had an asthma attack that left his throat closed and kept the poison out.  Yeah, right.  I have asthma.  If you have an asthma attack that closes your breathing off, you can kiss your sweet patootie goodbye... you aren't surviving.  But I hear you saying ""it was a miracle, that's the point"".  No, the only miracle would be if anyone thought this was a clever ending.  Night's gimmicky endings are seeming pretty strained these days, having gone from excellent in ""Sixth Sense"" to pretty unbelievable but still chilling in ""Unbreakable"" to downright silly in ""Signs"".I'd still recommend this film, but if you're looking for the great, insightful, mind-blowing ending you got in ""Sixth Sense"", you'll be disappointed.  The gimmick is starting to get old.",Signs

""Signs"" is not much better.Well, I don't go to the movies for realism .. especially not if I watch a Science *Fiction* film .. .. but ..*** warning - spoilers - if you haven't seen the movie yet...Aliens who travel lightyears to go to earth to harvest men .. and to whom water is toxic.. walk around naked without any protection on a planet on which water is quite common... and they walk around not only unprotected but unarmed as well.. and they even don't have the technical skill to remove some simple nailed on planks (while being able to build warp speed space ships).. and they need to punch huge signs into fields to mark their landing points (still while being able to have supertechnological space ships .. with sophisticated cloacing devices).. and then use these signs at night.. and apropos cloacing devices: they are invisible to radar and cannot be seen at bright daylight - but why didn't they turn off their lights at night? .. and so on .. and so on.If the script for ""Signs"" would have been used in the 1950ies to make a cheap B movie, it would have been o.k. (and certainly funny watching it nowadays), but in the early 21st century? .. such a story? Oh lord have mercy with us poor movie lovers.Sure, technically, this film was a nice piece of cinematic craftmanship, which I enjoyed. But with such a braindead story - it was nothing than a waste of money and time for me to watch this film.I gave it a 3 out of 10.

753,shawnk,It came from outer space had a better plot line.,5,4 August 2002,"Possible spoilers ahead.This is a really simple minded 'it came from outerspace' plot. Unfortunately, the 1953 movie, 'It Came From Outerspace' had more realism (hard to believe as bad as it was).Also the plot has NO --- read that ---- NO correlation with ANY accurate information on crop circles, alien visitations, or the characters of real people. It ONLY reflects the fantasy world of some really, and I mean reeeeeeaaaallly, shallow people who evidentally have sources of funding in Hollywood.Here are the negative highlights;[1] Shallow characters freak out in response to alien sightings. I know my share of shallow people and none of them would think the world would end because some aliens are stupid enought to come of all places, ....Earth. A planet ruled by a species who can make such dumb plots and still make a profit.[2] Hostile aliens with the technology to come here from 'where ever' and decide not to use weapons ( Hostile : A word meaning you probably wouldn't forget a weapon or two when leaving for a 40 million light year journey to earth - the planet of idiots in this plot).[3] Show some crop circles and forget about any correlation with numerous books on crop circles, aliens, etc. Just pull the concepts out of ... some dark hole somewhere and throw it together. At least alien sci-fi movies like 'Judgement Day' were entertaining (again, plot pretty shallow - nothing to do with any kind of accuracy with reported aliens, etc).In summary. The people who came up with Star Trek, the TV series, are eons beyond the amoebas that created this movie. Truly a shallow flick that hopefully will be used to train other directors and producers in how to create retro-grade entertainment. .... 'The movies' have finally come to be as bad as TV.",Signs
754,Chasuk,Very Bad Movie,1,3 August 2002,"I went to see Signs with something akin to hope. M. Night Shyamalan's previous directorial efforts were moderately entertaining, I had free tickets and free time, and my 15-year old daughter was eager to accompany me. So, with expectations of buttered popcorn and pleasant companionship, I headed to the movies.Abigail Breslin (Bo Hess) was marvelous. I don't know that I've seen such an impressive performance from a young American actor since Christina Ricci wowed us as Wednesday in the The Addams Family. Rory Culkin (Morgan Hess) did a credible enough job that I could almost forget his famous brother. The rest of the performances were adequate, but I can't say more than that.*SPOILER ALERT* The dialogue was embarrassing, the storyline maudlin (who didn't know that Mel Gibson would return to the clergy?), and the suspense was minimal. Okay, if you find reruns of Lassie or Flipper suspenseful, then this might have made you jump once or twice. My 15-year old didn't stir even during the cheap-but-(usually)-effective dog-snarls-and-leaps-suddenly-at-owner tactic.The movie attempted to be profound and address questions of faith, but all of the philosophizing was strictly at the sophomore level, and that is assuming that the sophomore is rather shallow. There will be some that say that I just didn't ""get it,"" but I did, thank you, and what was to be had was meager fare.The film was occasionally funny, and I do thank Mr. Shyamalan for at least breaking up my tedium with a little humor.No, I don't need my monsters to be slavering, or my suspense to be served with buckets of blood, but I do need coherence and intelligibility. A movie about crop circles had seemed a weak starting point (15 minutes of research will demonstrate to anyone how boring and mundane the phenomenon really is), but I hoped that Mr. Shyamalan would surprise us. He is capable of it, but he was apparently was trying to make a ""message"" movie on this occasion, in which he failed miserably.Oh, and what was it about the ""I'm melting"" Wicked Witch of the West ending that convinced Mr. Shyamalan that it was a good idea?  Was it done as a homage? As other reviewers have pointed out, the movie was replete with other filmic references, and I do have to wonder whether they were deliberate.Two thumbs down, and a single star.",Signs

""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain."" . . .

Unfortunately, too many elsewise amazing movies are deflated by a poor or mishandled denouement.  SIGNS is an explosive, well done film up until the last firework, which feels more like one of those white paper snappers you throw at the ground to make a popping noise. 
I can't, however, ignore the rest of the movie. MEL GIBSON et al deliver spectacular performances throughout.  Even M NIGHT himself does pretty good.

I was thrown out of the movie as soon as the director cast himself as a supporting role. His intro was practically a spoof of itself. The camera techniques to avoid seeing the aliens, and letting our imagination scare us was a clever technique (much like Aliens), but as soon as they were seen onscreen (TV bit, and end bit) the whole mystery/terror was quickly erased. Plus the reason for thier leaving is completely obsurd (as well as the end confrontation with the aliens). Lastly the director did his trademork flashback explanation ending, only for this film it wasn't necessary. The twist was that the story wasn't about aliens but about religion/family, and frankly that's not much of a twist, and you really don't need flashback to explain that.",Signs

Night Shyamalan movie. His previous movies have had fantastic stories and scenarios disguising a very simple and unexpected core plot. You may rush to the theater expecting to see aliens and be surprised. You will get both of those, but if that is your expectation than you are missing the movie. Do go see it.

I would rate ""The Sixth Sense"" an 8, ""Unbreakable"" a 5, and ""Signs"" a 2. I am beginning to think that we have already seen the best that Mr. Shyamalan has to offer.*** SPOILERS BELOW ***
Artistic Impressions: It's hard to figure out what this movie was trying to be. Was it a new look at an alien invasion movie? Nope. It seemed like a remake of ""War of the Worlds"". Was it a horror movie? Nah. It never seemed to relate to the viewer enough to get the viewer truly scared. A character exploration? Possibly, although the only character really being explored was Mel Gibson's. I never felt like I cared enough about his character to really want to see any more depth. Best that I can figure is that the movie is just trying to be another ""revenue enhancer"" for Touchstone Pictures.Pacing: The story was slow (as was true in M. Night Shyamalan's other movies). There was enough going on in the movie to keep me involved, but only barely. There were a few times that I looked at my watch to see how much of the movie was left (not a good sign). However, the few ""scary moments"" were well placed and gave me a little jump, even when I knew what was going on. The first couple of alien sightings were very well done.Acting:  The acting was mostly decent, although the children (as usual in Hollywood) were totally unrealistic. Mel's acting was good, but the character he was handed to play never really grabbed me.Special Effects: Very good. Everything was cohesive visually and audibly. There wasn't any time that I caught myself thinking, ""Cool special effects!"". (This is a *very* good sign). I firmly believe that special effects, when done correctly, shouldn't draw attention to themselves. Special effects should make a story more believable, not become the story.Strengths: Not much that I can think of here that I haven't mentioned already.Weaknesses: Poor plot cohesion. ""Signs"" is a story about a potential alien invasion. Why are the aliens invading? We never find out. Why didn't the aliens use their advanced technology to invade us? A weak quote from a goofy dime-store book about aliens solved that problem. One thing about that book, though - it was always right about what the aliens would do. Funny how that happens in movies, hmmm ;-)? Why did the aliens leave after just a few days? We never truly found out, although I would expect that they would have blasted the crap out of our planet if we had ""beaten"" them as easily as we did in the movie.Summary: Although the character development is decent, the main plotline was very weak. Don't go unless you feel that you really have to.",Signs

762,lyndacatherine,Truly dreadful.,1,25 March 2011,"A completely unbelievable premise from the start; this cheesy sci-fi nonsense is brimful of unlikely events and cryptic comments which turn out to be psychic predictions of advice needed in days to come. It is impossible to be scared despite the desperate attempts to build up the suspense, as at every moment, the viewer is bombarded by the ridiculous. From the start, the violent death of Mel Gibson's wife is portrayed with more comedy than horror, as she is pinioned between a truck and a tree and with her dying words, begins seemingly to ramble incoherently, including the words ""Swing away"". As crop circles and aliens (cartoon-style aliens) take over the neighbourhood, the son finds a textbook which seems to somehow predict the whole episode. At last the aliens begin to retreat, for some as-yet-unknown reason, but Mel and his family have a last battle to fight in their home. The alien attempts to kill Mel's child but _fortunately_ he has an asthma attack at that very moment (wouldn't you know it) so does not breathe in the toxic fumes and therefore survives (restoring Mel's faith, which had been sadly lost by the death of his wife). Meanwhile the words of Mel's dying wife are recalled, and Merrill ""swings away"", splashing the alien with water and thereby killing it (very Wizard of Oz).

Mel Gibson is given one of his most challenging roles here and delivers quite well. What presents itself as a 25 year remake of Spielburg's ""Close in counters"" builds itself to be much more than just a movie about alien contact. This movie explores deep spiritual issues while providing enough sci-fi jargon for the most rabid fans of the supernatural. There are plenty of ""jumps"" to keep you on the edge of your seat also. Some scenes of the film at first seem a bit awkward but by movies end, all elements of previous dialogue are tied together to underline the film's main theme.

Sure, the aliens are a bit weak and predictable, sure the plot has a lot of holes in it, but anyone who focuses on either of those issues has completely missed the point. Signs is not a movie about aliens - it's a movie about faith that happens to have aliens in it. It's a movie about how normal people react to abnormal situations - and the way that the actors showed that to us was far better than almost anything else around.Yes, Mel Gibson's character behaved irrationally - even incredibly stupidly - at times, but in the context of the character it was completely believable. We all do stupid things - and in the face of such stress we do them more often than not.The acting was superb throughout - the children were brilliant, and it says a lot about Shyamalan's abilities as a director that he can bring such performances out of them. This and Sixth Sense have the best performances from children I have ever seen.

The film keeps the audience on the edge of their seats and really does a good job of creating a heavy atmosphere. The movie follows a single father, his children, and his brother. M Knight Shyamalan has a way of creating that foreboding feeling you can sense in the pit of your stomach and this movie is no different. The actors do especially well in establishing this darker undertone. Personally, I found this movie to be extremely interesting and it definitely proved, yet again, that M Knight has a way of grabbing the audience's attention and not relinquishing them until the end credits.

Night missed many of things that made 'War of the Worlds' among others such good stories, letting the viewers use their own imagination to create the anxieties.

What starts out as a film similar to Independence Day, ends up being a movie with an unbelievable message that is just so hard to come across these days. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Pheonix only add to the already amazing screenplay. The little kids also add great comic relief along with bringing along great emotional moments. Unfortunately, you people that go to this and expect Independence Day in a cornfield will probably be sorely disappointed. However, I went into this film expecting a film about aliens and invasions, but I left feeling just a little better about my life. What starts out as just another end of the world alien invasion movie, ends up to be a sincere tale about faith and its importance. You want to love gibson's character the whole film, but there's just something holding you back. The deeper and deeper he resents himself, the more you feel sorry for him, but the more you want to love his character. And in a shocking conclusion, (possible ***spoiler*** ahead) Mel, a former reverand, realizes that God really never left his side, which is just the message I needed to hear on this particular night. If you're looking for an alien action movie, this has it's moments but it's not likely that you'll love this movie...But if you go in looking for a whole hearted drama about faith that just happens to be in the middle of an alien invasion, will you like this movie?

793,bdotson,"Self-serving, pretentious narcissism at it's worse",5,7 August 2002,"Okay. Let's give Shyamalan credit. The Sixth Sense was an excellent film. Unbreakable? It should have been called Unwatchable. Signs falls somewhere between the two (closer to the Unbreakable side.)First off. M. Night Shyamalan is FULL of himself! His ego is pouring out of every frame of this film. During the final scene I was seriously expecting him to appear on screen, jumping up and down while waving his arms screaming out ""Look at me! Look at me! Aren't I clever?""Actually, no ""Night"" you're not. I won't even get into that ridiculous nickname he gave himself... I will, however get into this ridiculous movie. ENOUGH of the gratuitous cameos. ENOUGH of the clever ""surprise"" endings. It worked for Sixth Sense, but it's time to move on and find a different writing style. (By the way, the ending of Signs isn't that clever. It's trying really hard to be, but it's not. The set up is awkward and the pay-off is clumsy.) ENOUGH with the superfluous credit he gives himself. I can't think of any other directors who credit themselves at the beginning AND the end of the film. But Shyamalan does, and it is  really lacking in taste. The first credit to appear at the close of the film: ""An M. Night Shyamalan Film."" BUT THE FONT IS SO LARGE THAT IT TAKES UP THE ENTIRE SCREEN! It comes across as self- serving, pretentious, and narcissistic. Nobody wants to see his name spelled with four-foot tall letters (except one person: M. Night Shyamalan).All that aside, basically Signs is a bit slow to start, gets really good, but totally blows it in the ending. I read one review of this film where the critic compared Signs to eating a really good meal...but you find a nasty hair in your food and it ruins it all. That pretty much sums it up. DON'T see this film. The more money Signs makes, the larger Shyamalan's ego will get, and we'll be stuck with his crappy films for years to come. And all that does is take attention away from the really talented filmmakers out there who actually deserve the recognition.Or maybe he'll learn to humble himself and his next film will be worthwhile...we'll have to wait and see.",Signs
794,nunyabisnesss,"TOTALLY INCREDIBLE!!! Hilarious, heartbreaking, horrifying! Scariest movie I've ever seen!STUNNING CLIMAX! 9 out of 10!",9,8 August 2002,"I have not seen The Sixth Sense, but I have heard enough about M. Night Shymalan to know he could be the next Spielberg. I have seen Unbreakable and I thought it was terrific. I'm still waiting to see the highly praised Sixth Sense, but I saw Signs (twice already). Signs is the best movie this year in my opinion. Better than Minority Report, Spider-Man, better than K-19 (which are some of my favorites this summer). The movie begins with the appearance of crop circles in former reverend, Graham Hess's (Mel Gibson) farm. His children, Morgan Hess and Bo Hess, are terrified and confused by them and their dogs begin acting strange, as if they sense a predator. They try to shake off the shock of the signs but the children become obsessed with aliens and it soon rubs off onto former baseball star Merill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix), Graham's brother. Six months before the movie opens, Graham's wife died and he's lost all faith in God (just a big part of the movie). From then on you are frightened out of your mind with nerve wracking intense scenes and jump scenes.This movie was the scariest movie I've yet seen. Even scarier than the rather ridiculous ""The Exorcist"". This movie has the three H's. It's Hilarious, Heartbraking, and Horrifying. The only thing that keeps it from getting a perfect 10 is this: When they actually showed an alien, it didn't scare me. The scene was intense but the aliens aren't that scary. That's just me though. People in the audience were screaming their lungs out. The climax was incredible though.
We had a great audience. People cheered when an alien was (spoiler!) getting the Hellen of Troy beat out of it. People were laughing, people were crying, and at the end, their was an applause.Great movie, 9 out of 10.See it or be disappointed you didn't!",Signs

1) People who don't get what the movie is really talking about and don't feel much for the movie.
2) People who get it and are deeply moved because they have experienced it in their own lives (not the aliens, but the real topic of the movie) - and for them, this movie is one of the most brilliant movies ever.That said, whatever group you belong in, there aren't many movies with such moving acting chemistry, believable dialogue and emotional buildup.And in the end, even if you don't get it, I'd recommend you keep the idea of the movie in the back of your mind.

796,sungwon444,"Signs is a scary, creepy movie, that leaves you stunned and satisfied at the end",9,3 August 2002,"Congratulations to the director, M. Night Shyamalan, for an excellent movie. Signs really distinguished itself from most of the shallow and ordinary movies of the summer (except Minority Report and Road to Perdition of course!). I am serious, if you want to see a movie that has a substance, quality, and lots of suspense and heart pounding horror, watch Signs!!!**Possible SPOILERS**The movie is about a retired reverend named Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), who has lost faith ever since his wife died in an accident. He refuses to have a family prayer during dinner, and he doesn't like it when people call him ""father"" (pertaining to the church). He lives with his two children (beautifully played by Rory Culkin and Abby Breslin) and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix, of Gladiator). One morning, the dogs are barking violently, and the kids have discovered an eerie, complex pattern on their crop field, better know as of course, a crop circle. It turns out that the rest of the world reflecks the situation going on at Buck County. There are crop circles in many other parts of the world, in India, Brazil, etc... As a tv commentor says, ""There are only two ways to explain this phenomenom, either this is inexplicable...something that cannot be explained...that is supernatural, or this is the most elaborate hoax"" Graham Hess takes his children to the town, expecting everyone to be happy, but it turns out that bookstore owners, the pharmacy lady, and other people have lost their faith, and are freaking out over the extraterrestrial invasion...That is basically the plot.Now, I will explain why this movie is so great.-Great acting!! Mel Gibson delivers another hearty performance. You always like this guy. He's so good at playing the father, like he does in the Patriot, We Were Soldiers, etc. Joaquin Phoenix was also good, and he surprised me. He was good at being funny also. Now, the kids were just excellent. Rory Culkin appears to have a promising future ahead of him. As for Abby Breslin, who plays the little girl, she is the CUTEST girl I have ever seen in my life. She's adorable, that's a fact.-The movie is SCARY, and touches on our biggest fear, the UNKNOWN! I mean, seriously, this is why the movie is so darn scary, it's about the unknown. The movie doesn't have aliens chasing people or flying in their spaceships like in Independence Day. This is all pure suspense and TERROR! There are plenty of JUMP-OUT-OF-YOUR-SEAT moments, I can think about at least 5 or 6. SO creepy! Nail biting terror!-The movie is smart and original. I mean, think about it. There has never been a movie about crop circles. The plot is smart, and Shyamalan has his own style that makes him unique.-Surprisingly, this movie touches our hearts. I mean, this is something The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable didn't do. At the end, we are exposed to elements and pointers concerning spiritually and the importance of faith and hope.-This movie is enjoyable and appealing to everyone. The problem with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable was that it was boring at times and so stretched out, that the audience had to struggle to pay attention. Not the case this time.-Worth your money big time!Go see it for yourself, and enjoy this movie. I can't give it 10 out of 10 (the only criticism I have for the movie is that I wished to see Shyamalan use the Crop Circles to extend on the plot, but the movie did not actually focus on the Crop circles)...So I give it 9  out of 10 stars",Signs
797,bryanlord,What do you get when you mix celluloid and chloroform?,2,19 August 2002,"The movie ""Signs."" To be fair, the line between hypnotic and soporific is a fine one (and Shyamalan drifted dangerously close to it in ""Unbreakable"") but ""Signs"" is set deep in the Land of Nod. It tried to weave a spell, but it knitted an Afghan. Let's hope this film is just the inevitable clinker in any genius's career, and that ""Sixth Sense"" was not a fluke. I, myself, intend to give M. Night-baby one more chance, but only because ""Sixth Sense"" was so very good, and because he's bucking the Spielbergian slide-show formula.If you don't go see this one, you won't be missing a thing but nonpareils. If you must see it, rent it, but don't come crying to me to get your money back. It's that bad. It's not even so bad it's funny. It's just slow and obvious and improbable and sketchy. It reminds me of the teleplays of the 50's, with one set, one camera, a cast of several, and radio-era special effects that happen offscreen. But don't think that it's good in the way that those old-time adaptations could be good, and don't think that it consciously harks back to them (though that may be what it was trying for).

It would have been that if there wasn't for one huge mistake:microphones! They stick out all movie long from every angle imaginable so it sometimes looks like a TV interview. I mean,they had a huge budget and all digital wonders at their hands and still this happens? Mr.Shyamalan please check your prints more carefuly next time. All this had no effect at box office result and wasn't mentioned in any reviews so the film became the biggest hit in Mel Gibson's carierr and had excellent reviews. This is not totally undeserved: apart from mikes everything else is great. Shyamalan proves once more that he's one of Hollywood's best directors. The way he tells this not-so original story(in my opinion Shyamalan is a better director than a scriptwritter)is brilliant. The camera is always placed at the most perfect spot. Thrills and chills are not forced upon you,the film slowly creeps under your skin. Film is emotional and deeply religious without being pathetic and scary without having any gore(less is more!). Calm and inteligent stuff from start to finish, the oposite of ,let's say, Michael Bay's work(one of Hollywood's worst directors). Acting is top notch but that is expected when you have Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix in leading rolls. I rate this one 8/10. It would have been a pure 10 value if not for those damn mikes.",Signs

I loved out the build up to the alien arrival was played out, how we saw all the coincidences coming together at the end of the movie, and the general feeling you got from the movie knowing there was little hope.There were however 2 things that I didn't like very much. I didn't like how the Aliens looked, they looked like cheap computer graphics and didn't scare me in the least bit. They came down with a wrath and basically got bitched out by a young teenager and his bat. One more fault I didn't like was the excuse of why the aliens ran away. ""Using Mid-Eastern rituals"" doesn't really cut it very much and it seems like it was very rushed. I don't blame them though because instead of having a couple aliens invade earth, they had millions of aliens invade and it would have been both stupid and impossible for the main cast to defeat them.Anyway, it was a good movie and I give it a solid B or B+",Signs
800,gimmeabreak,SUCH a disappointment!,3,3 November 2003,"First and foremost, I absolutely loved M. Night Shyamalan's prior movies. I think his cinematic eye, attention to detail and sense of dark humor is normally very refreshing. HOWEVER, I cannot see how anyone would consider Signs even a ""good"" movie. Shyamalan's prior movies gingerly lead you through a maze strewn with clues which would eventually bring you a surprizingly satisfying apex at the end of the film. This film just led us through a corn field.
All of the elements that you thought would matter at some point -  didn't. All of the characters that you thought would matter at some point - didn't. The dramatic twist of a ending didn't happen. The scifi movie that was in the commercials didn't happen. I suppose the acting was good considering they had such paper thin characters to work with.I sat with my mouth open during the last half of the movie because I was amazed at how bad it was. Then the end added insult to injury. This was simply a weak remake of ""The War of the Worlds"" (perhaps those of you who actually liked Signs should watch it). That's it.

The funniest part, is when Gram comes back to the house and  he looks over at his kid and his brother sitting on the couch with tin-foil hats on their heads. That part cracks me up every time!

804,armo_852,"Not as good as 'Sixth Sense', much better than 'Unbreakable'",7,8 February 2004,"SPOILERS The three M. Night Shyamalan films I have seen have relied heavily on the use of prolonged suspense. This tactic may seem to some very slow and boring, and this was certainly the case with 'Unbreakable', one of the worst films I have ever seen. As is often true, the first is the best and 'The Sixth Sense' is by far and a way the superior film of the three. But 'Signs', on first time viewing anyway, is worth the watch.Shyamalan does manage to create tension here, in parts, but it does veer towards dire 'Unbreakable' territory too. The film's best moments are undoubtably the scenes where the aliens are present BUT off-screen. This leaves room for audience imagination and this is always more nerve-wracking than any visuals on screen. Therefore the most effective scenes are when Gibson is wandering around in the corn at night, with hidden aliens around him, the alien trapped in the pantry scene and the start of the final attack, as the trapped family hear aliens scurrying over their house.But like so many films down the years, as soon as the supernatural menace is revealed to the audience the tension drops considerably and consequently the film is less interesting. The representation of the aliens is so stereotypical. The thin, green figure that is clearly based on humans. The whole sentimental thing fails to convince too. The 'swing away' finale is cringeing viewing and the recollections of the children's birth could have been much more subtle. The discussion on the couch that people are separated into two categories, those who believe things are meant to be and those who simply think it's coincidence is valid and reasonable, but not really appropriate in the context of seeing what could be alien spacecrafts on the TV. What has coincidence got to do with anything? It's whether the images are real or not that should be the discussion. It is only in the 'swing away' climax we realise the reason for the inclusion of the coincidence discussion.However I don't want to rip into this film that much because I did enjoy much of it. And it does have one genuine moment when the audience jump in shock and that is when the dog suddenly barks at the kids when they are playing. Typically the most effective shock does not include the human-like aliens, and that is no coincidence.",Signs
805,bootjangler,A cheap alternative to sleeping pills,1,4 May 2004,"As a sci-fi fan, I looked forward to this film, although being slightly uneasy about the director's previous project 'Unbreakable'.Signs is overall a thinking film, but to get through it, you will need lots of caffine. The dialogue is so slowly whispered throughout and the scenes played even slower. If I had a penny for saying 'get on with it' throughout the film, I'd have £1.68.Mel Gibson hardly moves and basically keeps the same dour expression throughout. The kids are robotically weird and the minor characters lifeless.Not once did I see these characters as believeable.As with Unbreakable, the director, M Night Shyamalan, has given a thoroughly boring movie experience.",Signs
806,MTGrizzly,Stop Signs?,2,12 April 2005,"After Shyamalan's excellent work on ""Sixth Sense,"" I was really looking forward to Signs. Unfortunately, Signs never lived up to its hype and, certainly, not to its heritage.This movie was the worst of Independence Day, (the way the aliens communicated), Night of the Living Dead, (boarding themselves up in to the basement), and The Wizard of Oz, (kill the aliens by throwing water on them? ""Help me, I'm melting...), all rolled into one. The plot was completely predictable. The characters were not to be believed. The movie was made up of pieces of other, better films, assembled in a haphazard manner. The subplot concerning Hess' dead wife was pointless, what did his wife's death have to do with aliens from outer space? It amounted to 106 minutes of spooky sounding music that was supposed to increase the tension for the climax. Unfortunately, what was going to happen in the end was so predictable right from the start, it just ended up being 90 minutes of boring and 16 minutes of bad special effects. The tag line, ""It's not like they didn't warn us,"" says it all. Anyone who didn't get that the aliens were coming would have to have been deaf and blind. The constant references to water gave away the climax long before the aliens got there. The movie was set in Pennsylvania, not Siberia, was it really necessary to hide in the basement? Why didn't they just call someone, it's not like they were all alone. The problem is, I wish someone had warned me about how bad this movie really was, so I could have saved my $7.00.",Signs

808,knowinglygotebola,Irrefutably Putrescent,1,13 August 2013,"I will start with the positive aspects of this film, of witch there are few. Mel Gibson is believable, if only because all he had to do was look slightly downcast and beyond that be emotionless. The movie is slightly frightening at times and the scenes in the corn are legitimately scary.Aside from these small redemptions, this movie is ridiculous. Although the aliens can travel across the universe and make themselves invisible, they are completely incapable of protecting themselves from their weakness, water (?), which covers most of the surface of the planet they are attacking, is the most common part of the beings they plan to harvest, they cannot escape from rooms if they are boarded up, they cannot fight or exert any strength on anything... The list goes on.Near the end, an alien that is left behind in the house grabs the boy, who is suffering from asthma. Then, in the least effective scene I have seen in any movie, the family all stares in horror at the alien. The father has a religious realization while he is staring... Meanwhile, the alien continues to stand there, not moving, apparently equally appalled as the humans. He makes no attempt to escape, does not harm the boy, and waits a full five minutes, waits until the family realizes that they could hurt the alien with a baseball bat (genius!) to use his poison spray. Why not attack the alien earlier? Why not take the boy and escape? Why didn't the family take the medicine down with them? Why didn't they have weapons with them? Why is this movie so terrible?!?! The theme of the movie is religious. I can accept that, except that it is badly contrived and makes a ridiculous connection between religion and coincidence. The bizarre tendency for the little girl to leave cups of water out is a blatant setup for the ending, when water is exposed as the aliens' weakness. The boy's asthma was also obviously set up for the poison gas the alien sprays in his nose. And it is apparently miraculous that the main character's wife told him to tell Merril to keep playing baseball. Because she obviously meant that only he, great baseball player that he was, could possibly use a baseball bat to kill an alien. And because they had all of their own bizarre problems or talents (the ability to swing a baseball bat, for example), this means that some divine being is looking out for them. A completely immature and nonsensical interpretation of religion. A clumsy and pathetic attempt to convey this theme. God-awful.Do not ever watch this movie. It is an insult to science fiction, to movies, to writers, to the audience.",Signs

However, as the story progress, I could see what was going on, why character acted as they did and it all puzzled out.The ending was somewhat with twist I guess but it wasn't so surprising as sixth sense. However, the ending was very good. I would say that this ending of the movie was the 2nd best after sixth sense of M. Night Shyamalan's movie. The pieces of movie were clearly solved at the end and it made me awed for how the movie ended. I liked the lesson that the movie gave to the audience. The ending was very good.Also, the actors had great acting skills also. The family in this movie, each one had distinctive characteristic that they all were different.

812,Ragby,More Nitpicking?,6,8 August 2002,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN:  I was disappointed with Signs.  I don't mind slow, quiet films but this was too slow for me.  I thought Mel Gibson was sort of one-dimensional and a bit rigid.  The other actors were good, however, and the film did have a couple of really intense moments, without stooping to chaotic, overblown special effects.Most of all, the religious aspect of it bothered me, especially coming from the seemingly multicultural Shyamalan.  I would think that actually being confronted with beings from another world would make one seriously question organized religion and the traditional creation and morality stories we've been told all our lives.  I wonder....does Christianity (or any mainstream religion) mention alien life forms (and what to do about them)?  It seemed to me that Mel Gibson's character retreated to religion in a knee-jerk, frightened way; it became his sanctuary away from science and reality and thought.  That probably happens all the time in real life but wouldn't the film have been less prosaic with a broader view of humankind's place in the universe?  Maybe not.I wanted to know more about why the creatures were there and what else was happening in the rest of the world.  I wanted to know why the aliens didn't have weapons.  How could they be so advanced in space travel but need mapping signs (crop circles) and not have a clue about the water situation--couldn't they have worn protective gear?  I just don't buy the whole scenario and think that M. Night, while directing some really scary moments, ultimately had a weak, frustrating story.  I could be wrong, though.",Signs

Were The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, or Signs really all that different? Essentially strange things happen, clues are dropped along the way, and finally the ""money shot"", for lack of a better term, where everything (sort of) ties together.  The problem is that each time out his plot twists become less and less convincing.  Even the endlessly recycled score doesn't inspire me to care too much.And I didn't know what this movie was really about.  Was it about mysterious crop circles?  alien invasions?  renewal of faith?  I suppose the latter most of all, but if so, why have all this trite alien sci-fi stuff or if not why the constant new age pseudo-intellectual jabber?  One could have easily replaced all of that with a completely different set of events and it wouldn't have mattered in the slightest to the plot.The only thing I really learned from this film was to avoid future Shyamalan thrillers because I've already seen them in the past.

Shyamalan has already proven his talent. Character insight seemed forthcoming in the films description. So what went wrong? The film needed to go deeper. It's main action line was just too simple. I could not ignore the fact that we needed not just to be frightened, but needed to have an epiphany of thought as well. It did not happen for me. The acting was subdued, albeit good. However, the screenplay should have given us more to think about. It did not. I wanted to see more psychological turmoil, not just physical confrontation. The ""signs"" should have revealed more than damaged crops.

Especially when I found out that it was by M. Night Shaymalan.  I love his previous work and this film is truly a shining example of one of the greatest new filmmakers of the 21st century.  Using his unique story writing that utilizes the most minute details to become the center of the climax of the movie, he grabs you from start to finish.  Before seeing the film, I had read a previous comment on IMDB from a person who attended a test screening of the film and didn't expect much when I was planning to see it.  But I left the theater in complete awe.  This is the first movie to actually scare me in a long time, because it portrays how the human race would actually act in the event of a close encounter. (Mainly how everyone is glued to the TV set as though it was 9-11.)  I was especially freaked out when a particular scene that entailed a home video in South America showing a pretty full shot of an alien so soon in the picture.  Constant startling moments and an assurance of human faith were plenty to carry this film.  The person who attended the screening was slightly right about the ending.

Alas no.And the subplot involving the restoration of Gibson's faith is so incredibly ham handed and ludicrous that it drains all the spirit out of the movie - no pun intended.

822,eddievedder55,Misleading Advertisement (possible spoiler),3,3 August 2002,"I just got through seeing this movie and it was a huge, unbelievable disappointment. It was advertised as being about crop circles,UFOs,and aliens. Well, it had all that in it but it was also advertised as being scary or creepy and like something big and suspenseful would happen. The suspense is waiting for something anything to happen to wake you up out of the coma that you'll be in watching this sleeper. This movie is not really about spooky crop circles and figuring out what they mean or even the UFOs or aliens. It's about a man who has lost his faith in God and finds it again. The same old typical dramatic mambo jumbo. I went thinking that this would be an original movie about crop circles and the mysteries surrounding them. Possibly the movie might have addressed whether it was a message made by aliens to communicate with each other or some other beings on some other planet. But this movie didn't do that. Sure it speculated that the crop circles were SIGNS of something beyond, sending a message out to the other aliens but it really didn't explore that idea much.I thought that finally a decent movie on the subject of crop circles was being made. Crop circles are real after all and many people don't realize just how many crop circles there are out there. This movie instead focuses on a family and the tragedy that they have experienced. My problem with this movie is that it was advertised to be something that it is not. It sucks in that way! What it turned out to be was a drama full of some creepy and suspenseful moments but for the most part was about the family. In this way, it still sucked! It was typical. The ending was predictable after all that you had seen!The only up side to this film is that it had a lot of funny parts. It was more funny than anything else. Thank goodness for that much!This movie needed more. Maybe someone else will make an incredible movie more thoroughly exploring the mystery of crop circles and still be able to tell an emotionally charged story that intrigues and excites the audience. I'm not saying make a documentary because that's been done I've seen those but incorporate more techniques to both explore more deeply the mysteries of crop circles as well as explore the people that they affect. Don't use the subject of crop circles as a tag line to really tell a story about a classic family drama without making it clear in the advertisement. I've seen other movies do this same misleading crap and I'm getting tired of it!!!!Watch this movie if you want to see a somewhat creepy,suspense about something you already figured out, and to see Mel Gibson cry like a baby.",Signs

824,davidesachs1,Not my favorite by M. Night...,3,6 May 2006,"Gibson, whose salary probably represents a significant portion of Signs' budget, plays Father Graham Hess, a widower who is caring for his two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigain Breslin), on a Bucks County (Pennsylvania) farm. Following his wife's death six months ago, Graham has done his best to keep his family together. He is aided by his younger brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), who moved to the farm following the tragedy. But Graham has lost his faith in God and has renounced his vocation. Then, one morning, he awakens to an amazing discovery - crop circles in his fields. At first, he is inclined to believe it's all a hoax, but, as evidence mounts that this may not be the case, he and his family realize that what has happened in their fields may be the first signs that Earth is about to have a close encounter.While much of Shyamalan's setup is familiar, the meat of the story has an exotic flavor. Taking a page from Steven Spielberg's Jaws, the director keeps the aliens hidden from our view. We catch occasional, brief glimpses - a leg in the corn field, a hand under a door, and a flash of green on a television screen. With today's special effects being so convincing, it's unusual for a filmmaker to fall back on the old, tried-and-true technique of ""less is more"". In the case of Signs, it creates a level of tension that a full revelation would have spoiled.Then there's the added mystery of whether the aliens are benevolent or aggressive. Shyamalan obscures their intentions for most of the movie, concentrating instead upon the fears and concerns of the characters when they don't know the truth. Graham gives a speech in which he talks about how some humans will view first contact as a miracle that gives them hope, while others will see it as a cause for anxiety and uncertainty. In other words, is Earth about to be subjected to a Close Encounters or an Independence Day? For quite some time, Shyamalan doesn't tip his hand, and, when he does so, it isn't in a predictable manner.",Signs
825,hardwood53,Slow moving. narrow focus.,4,15 September 2008,"I woke up in the middle of the night and saw ""Signs"" all the way through the first time, guided by these reviews. As I read these reviews it seemed we have people from show business and others in related fields. I thank you for giving some very insightful reviews and synopsis. I still like Mel Gibson even after his recent transgressions. His Road Warrior films were instant cult favorites. I just hoped this movie would put me back to sleep, but these reviews had me thinking.Only 10 films in 16 yrs. 'listed here at IMDb' and M. Night Shyamalan is declared the next Hitchcock. It is an insult to a great mans legacy. Look up Alfred Hitchcock here at IMDb, check out his stats. He was relevant to his generation, as reflected by his popularity and prodigious body of work. Maybe there are some stylistic similarities to Alfred, but M. Night is missing some crucial elements that made Alfred Hitchcock household words. M. Night Shyamalan is more an Alfred Hitchcock imitator than the implied replacement. I think for the most part M. Night Shyamalan makes movies only film students can appreciate. We common viewers just want something that grabs our attention and holds it. It is also nice when a think piece (as the pacing of this movie suggests) makes sense. ""Spoiler Alert"" No one emotes the fear of having a regular intruder, let alone one of such unusual and dangerous a nature. So the bulb getting busted should have been a much bigger deal. Another problem was creature design. If you are going to show a creature of this nature, design it so it is well suited to its implied capabilities. Of course warriors can be a different species than the tool makers. M. Nights vision of the Alien Menace, is a naked, slow moving, underpowered creature with claws unsuitable for tool skills. That thing would never have survived natural selection on our brutal planet. No space ships, space guns, suits or accessories. No expensive locations, nor unique scenery, nor difficult stunts. Nothing complex or painstaking. Few extras, few vehicles, no great logistics duties. At $72,000,000 for production costs ""Signs"" must have been a good payday for someone.",Signs
826,scerevisiaety1,"About faith, the film decides to focus on aliens.",2,7 August 2002,"Several reviewers are correct in that this is a film about the personal struggles within a family and specifically the struggle of one man (Gibson) with faith. Gibson's character, once a reverend, has lost his faith following the seemingly pointless and horrid death of his wife in an accident. The plot of the movie is mainly the renewal of Gibson's faith as he discovers his wife's death is not a random and pointless accident, but has a designed purpose behind it. The events that cause this renewal in the character's faith is an alien invasion. Frankly I found the film to be lousy - and not because of the film's focus per se. I did not expect a slam 'em bang 'em flick as Independence Day nor did I expect amazing special effects. Neither of those elements make any film good alone. I did expect a deep story about Gibson's character's faith. As noted above, the idea was there, but it was executed rather badly. Most of the film centers around these signs of the alien invasion - but they are useless to the story other than driving Gibson towards the ultimate rediscovery of his faith in divine purpose. The film therefore is simply a bunch of scenes that are driving to the rather short and unsatisfying ending. Because the ending is so important to the film and you realize that the alien stuff is just backdrop to the whole story, you sit in the theater just waiting for the film to end. It could easily have been a half hour episode of the Twilight Zone rather than the 2 hours (or near) that it is. The backstory of Gibson's loss of faith take up about 15 minutes of screen time if that. The rest of the film is taken up with 'tense' sequences dealing with the characters trying to figure out if the aliens are out there and what they're up to. But we the audience already knows the point of the film has nothing to do with aliens, so who cares? In additon, the tense scenes aren't scary or that tense either. The cinematography of the film was good. Mel Gibson and the actors playing his family did all do a good job with what they had - but very little they had actually added to the theme of faith in the movie. Other scenes and actors gave weak performances. Particularly I remember a scene where the 'uncle' is speaking to an army officer where I wondered why the scene was even taking place (oh yeah, to establish the whole baseball bat thing!) I'm rolling my eyes.POSSIBLE SPOILER I don't want to reveal too much, but the whole baseball bat idea of 'swing it' was a rather weak way leading to reinspiring faith. It almost seems like Gibson's character is stretching to give meaning to his wife's words so that he can get through the disaster that is at hand at the film's end. Perhaps that is the point, but if it is, nothing more is said or implied to give the film any true meaning.I liked the Sixth Sense. Unbreakable was okay. This film could have been good if it would have stuck to its main theme of rediscovery of faith. The focus of this film is instead misplaced around the aliens And thereby many theater-goers are understandably surprised when the end FINALLY comes to learn it's supposed to be all about faith. No matter what you go to this film for (faith or aliens) you should be disappointed.",Signs
827,umyde,When will Shyamalan direct a REAL thriller again?,3,1 November 2002,"The day before I viewed Signs, I saw The Sixth Sense for the third time. This made me think of the way Shyamalan's verve has been evolving - in my opinion, on a downwards spiral. In The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan knew what a thriller was all about - to thrill the viewer. Instead of scary monsters, troubled people who don't realize they're dead are used. In Signs, things get blurred. Stuck between the thrill and the spoof of itself, this movie wastes whichever creativity one could expect. Is it AT ALL credible that the sequence of events wich lead to understanding that coincidences have indeed a purpose can be put to a serious use in this plot? Haven't movies such as Julio Medem's Los Amantes Del Circulo Polar treated the same plot device in a much better way? Top this with the all too frequent humurous moments (which completely wipe away any seriousness one might feel towards this movie) and you've got a useless piece of would-be thriller with occasional jumpy frights. As for the acting, things just don't get any better. Movie after movie, Mal Gibson only proves to be Hollywood's most wasted talent. As for Joaquin Phoenix, he surely needs to rise from his ashes. I can only think of two things that salvage (though not save) Signs. First of all, Tak Fujimoto's cinematography - by far the greatest artist to be perceived here. Secondly, Shyamalan's own directing skills, wich remaining intact. But one does not have to look further than some of Spielberg's movies or Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down to understand that fine craftsmanship does not necessarily make a good film. Shyamalan needs to find his twist of inspiration, which seems to be further away in every new movie he directs.",Signs

I was surpassed by a more complex, enriching story.""Signs"" is loosely based on H.G. Wells' ""The War of the Worlds"" where aliens attempt to take over the Earth. However, in Shyamalan's version, there is also something else aside from the invaders: faith. Mel Gibson, a former reverend named Graham Hess, has lost his faith in God after a horrible family tragedy and become atheist. Upon these events emerging from crop circles in his fields to all over the world, his close ones, his brother Merril (Joaquin Phoenix) and his two children Morgan and Bo, along  with himself, begin to interpret independently what these events could mean. Eventually, they all merge together into one: the end of the world. They must find a way to protect themselves and hope it will ""all pass."" The scenes have very good acting and emotion to each one.I enjoyed this film. Very much. It's not about why aliens attempt to colonize the earth or how crop circles are made. It's about one thing: a man's journey to realize that there is still something left for him to believe in, to discover whether events happen for a reason, or just ""pure luck."" There were comic moments in the films that were not intended to be so, but the audience I was with, along with myself, found them to be hilarious, especially Phoenix's character.I urge all those to see it.

Signs is quite possibly the single lamest movie ever created!  The mind-boggling coincidences, patheticly obvious foreshadowing, cheesy messages relentlessly hurled at the viewer, glaring plot holes, silly use of technical concepts, and all around poor quality can not even BEGIN to counteract the few genuinely creepy or scary sequences.  Even if you buy into the explanation that the entire movie was a dream (which I don't) then the idea was not implemented well if only 1 out of every 5000 people got it.  In addition, the dream explanation degrades the entire movie into a churchy, ""how could I ever have doubted my faith?"" piece of garbage!  If you see this movie, I'm sorry!  If you like this movie, I pity you!  If you vote to keep this movie in the top 250, I hate you with a passion the likes of which you've never seen!1 out of 10!",Signs
836,danicabrown,A real look at the inner person,9,10 June 2004,"Prior to finally watching this film, I had heard very little about it. I had seen the trailers, seen the box office records, but other than my sister telling me it had creeped her out, had heard no comments on how other people felt about the film or what the film was about. The trailers led me to believe that the film was about Aliens and would be scary, and while it is indeed about Aliens, the film touches on so much more than that. The film, while a little jumpy and perhaps a bit of a ""horror"" flick for its suspense, was not a mindless film. It was one where you needed to pay attention. All of this director's films are that way. Hidden messages that you must remember later on in the film. I find that to be positively stimulating. I was in no way bored, as other reviewers have stated.The film centers around a man, Graham Hess (Gibson), and his struggle with god. His personal faith lost after his wives death, he gave up on his church and is trying to live a normal, albeit sad, existence with his children and his brother (Pheonix). Each of the characters has their own ""quirks"". You can see that each of them has anger at life. In this film, the aliens are used to symbolize Grahams fight with god. Instead of god, it is the aliens. It almost seems as though god has sent the aliens to remind Graham of his presence. While Graham is trying to make sense of what is going on once the strange ""goings on"" begin, it is very much like Graham's struggle with his wives death. There is shock, denial, acceptance, fear and anger. He battles to save the family that remains as well as himself. When Graham realize's, at the end, how to kill the alien that has entered his home, it's amazing. It shows that there are no coincidences. His wife, with her dying words, showed part of how to overcome. Hinting that perhaps she knew what would happen. That god had given her the words to show Graham the way. And the fact that the person who killed his wife, Reedy, also in a statement to Graham, gave Graham the final piece of information needed to save his family. Reedy stated that it was like he was meant to fall asleep at the wheel at exactly that moment, when she would be there. Like he was meant to kill her. And the wife said the same. That it was meant to be. And it was. So that both people could, in the end, show Graham the way. Each had information. Had Reedy never hit Graham's wife, I don't believe Graham and he would have ever had the conversation they had. It was very complex, a true look at the struggles of a family, of a man, when faced with unbearable loss. But instead of a dramatic, sad film to show these struggles, the director used a fear that everyone has. The fear of Aliens. This allowed everyone viewing the film to have a fear already, better equipping them to feel what Graham felt and follow along in his journey.",Signs

838,paulod21,Show me a NEW plot line...PLEASE!!!!,5,30 September 2002,"Whilst all the actors performed their roles well, the plot line was disappointing.  Haven't we seen this kind of (weak) plot before?  The premise that these super-intelligent creatures can be defeated by wooden doors beggars belief!!As to the ""reason"" for their ultimate defeat, it smacks of either 8th grade wannabe writers or sheer laziness!

839,pelverud,What is wrong with you people?,10,4 August 2002,"I cannot believe some of the terrible reviews being written for this film. No, not because the film is bad, but where is the intellect?The audience that understands the craft of film-making and does not need to be pummeled about the head with ridiculous special effects and obvious, unneeded exposition?  In response to some of the uneducated alleged ""reviews"" above, I proffer the following remarks:***Spoilers possible, written for those who've seen the film***-""The mood is lost in the film because of the humor..."" --Exactly the opposite. The humor early on actually BUILDS the suspense. Duh! The film is realistically showing that people often deal with the unknown in different ways, often times with humor. This is especially so when Gibson and Phoenix run around the house toward each other. THEY THINK THEY ARE SCARING OFF HOAXTERS! Geez, you didn't get that? Having the main characters, especially the adults take this seriously would have ruined continuity, Oh!, sorry for the big word, I mean the order of events in the film.-""The movie is disjointed or disconnected"" -- No, it was perfectly blended. That is called ""suspense"" and is above your head. There is not a wasted shot in the film. If anything the movie is almost too perfectly paced. I have no idea how someone could have missed out on that...-""Why would an alien form allergic etc. to water land on Earth?"" -- So you are saying because the oceans etc. are wet they cannot still land on solid ground and harvest humans? We (humans) cannot live in/or on the 2/3 of the planet that is water, but we stick around anyhow. What a ridiculous comment!-""The end was terrible, he should not have shown the alien etc...""-- Wrong again Einstein(s). The ending was perfect. This is not some cheap scary alien pic. The aliens are on recon mission. The only reason we see the alien at the end is to tie the movie together. THE WHOLE POINT OF THE FILM IS BEING MADE HERE!!!!!! The aliens are scary because of what we do not know about them. We do not really see them, do not know what they are capable of or what weapons they have. By not showing them throughout the film up to the climax REINFORCES that idea. After surviving the evening, coming upstairs and hearing that the aliens were repelled by the world, the family is ready to face their fears. Therefore, when the family encounters the lost, bewildered, and quite naked alien(i.e. no weapons or any real abilities beyond what humans are capable of) WE SEE THE FAMILY FACE THEIR FEAR! DUHHHHHHHHH! Yes the alien is beatable, he does have poison gas, but little other offensive or defensive prowess. Yes 8th grade dropouts, it is possible that a highly intelligent lifeform may not use weapons! Perhaps they have only encountered beings like cattle and clueless movie reviews who did not need to be subdued any more than with the gas?  If you recall, some of the information in the book that Gibson's son is reading is true and some false. One page shows an alien ship blasting a house with lasers. This is an earthly idea. Sure, aliens may do that, but mostly that IS HUMAN IGNORANCE PROJECTING ITS OWN FAULTS/PERSONAL IDEAS ONTO OTHER CULTURES. If the aliens in the film were using weapons, the ships hovering over cities would have just blasted everything and picked up the leftover bodies to take home for whatever reason. Those quiet, static ships/lights show to the characters in the film, and to those of us with IQ's over 110 that they are not Aliens-A-Go-Go with blasters et.al., but more complicated creatures that must be met head-on in the end so we(and the characters) can vanquish our foes. The ending was perfect, exiting and completely necessary.-Those not understanding this film made a mistake, go to the little theater down the hall showing ""Men in Black 2."" That movie is more your speed. Please quit trying to sound ""smart"" or ""forward thinking"" by continually trashing movies that are over your head. It just makes you look even more droll than you obviously are already.",Signs

This movie has characters that count (especially the kids),a story that keeps you guessing, and keeps you looking around the next corner to see what M. Night will reveal next so you can try to guess how the whole thing pans out. For those of you out there that understand the basic tenets of film making like foreshadowing, pace etc. M.

841,Jamesgraphics,Cliche ridden and full of plot holes... avoid!,4,7 October 2002,"This poor movie has neither the depth to be a drama nor the scares to rank as the suspense/thriller that it's been marketed as.ROPEY PLOT:The low-key plot sees a family headed by Mel Gibson living in a farm house, struggling to come to terms with the death of Gibson's wife (who is also the mother of his two children), which has caused Gibson, an ex-preacher, to loose his faith. Then comes the alien invasion...  ***SPOILERS***PLOT HOLES & CLICHES:The aliens are rather ridiculous big green men, who seem remarkably primitive considering the UFO's they are supposed to have built.It later transpires that these aliens dissolve into goo when sprayed with water. It doesn't really seem to pose a serious threat to mankind when all you need is a f***ing water pistol to see them off...Gibson's family barricade themselves in their farmhouse, and this must be the only movie in history where this actually works, successfully keeping the aliens at bay.Eventually, a radio broadcast announces that the aliens are retreating, though it is not yet clear why. Maybe it just started raining.Worst of all is the oldest cliche in the book, preacher Gibson losing his faith after the death of his wife in a car accident. You can probably guess what happens to his faith at the end of the movie.***END OF SPOILERS***CONCLUSION: Shyamalan doesn't even have one of his usual gimmicky twist endings to redeem this feature, and his Spleilbergian use of the family unit is somewhat cloying.

First of all Signs is not an excellent sci fi thriller but it surely is a great movie.I liked the story of a man regaining his faith.I also liked the humour and the performances(especially Joaquin Phoenix). So don't go to the movie expecting a scifi thriller.Expect a well made movie portraying human emotions very beautifully.It has its creepy moments too. It has its flaws of course.I didn't like the alien because it looked stupid.

And that is not a surprising fact, as we well know that its creator is a man with natural talent in this respect. However ""Signs"" lacks on the imagination side, imagination was focused on delivering brilliant visual scenery rather than intrigue. The plot was too closed in itself, the ""topography"" of suspense did not manage to tingle the viewer. Action built up then suddenly faded into dramatic moments that left suspense aside. This usually would not be a big deal but when one goes to see a movie with the thematic nature of ""Signs"" he not only wants to see good acting, camera work and brilliant images but also wants to leave the theater in owe, shocked and by that satisfied. That is what the movie lacks.Apart from that this is a very decent film.6/10",Signs
845,my_angel,"Wow, what a Sign!",10,7 August 2002,"This was a great film.  I saw it on Aug. 6, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was entertaining, it was scary, it was funny, and excellent the whole way through.  It was a good story with some good performances from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix.  I must say (concidering I love Joaquin Phoenix), that I liked Merill's character the best.  He was extremely funny and plays a very real and well defined character, and you just love him in this movie. A good example of him being funny is watching the news going ""Move children!"" (If you see the film you'll get it).
The comedic lines and the suspense of the film are balanced so well, the movie just flows.  I got scared in this film (at some parts the whole audience jumped), I laughed, and I cried.  The whole emotional thing going on in the family really added a lot to the story.  It showed how it really would be, and how the fear was getting to them.  The kid actors were awesome.  I loved both Morgan and Bo, and their closeness to both their father and their uncle really added to the reality of the movie.  I agree that the few that didn't like the movie missed the whole point.  It was a family movie.  It was about a family.  (I bawled during the dinner scene). Being a Christian, I also enjoyed the spiritual part of the movie, showing that everything happens for a reason.  It show's God's hand in everything.
This is the scariest movie I ever saw in theatres.  I saw it yesterday and was scared last night and this morning.  I recommend you see it.  You'll be glad you did!!

846,StoicBlade,Overrated and a major disappointment.,1,4 December 2002,"I cannot understand the popularity of this film. Mel Gibson is mis-cast as the ex-priest. The acting is not great. Both, Gibson and Phoenix comes across as simple hicks. My favorite scene: When Phoenix equates an experience of almost kissing a girl who vomits to Gibson's discussion of signs and lost faith. Doh! An the aliens are some of the worst, rubbery costumed fakes that I have seen in a long time. The plot is slow and labored and the ending comes on too strong. On a final note, will someone please tell M. Night Shyamalan to stop appearing in his own films! It ruins the suspension of disbelief (he stands out like a sore thumb) and he is no Hitchcock. Leave the acting to the actors.",Signs
847,robertlloyd777,A mediocre Film,5,16 February 2003,"SPOILERS HEREINI saw this movie on a date, and quite frankly, thought that it was a waste of time. There were some high points, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was very good. (I thought it was weird to see him as an average young American male, after watching him as the psychotic emperor Commodus in Gladiator). There were some scary parts, like where Mel sees the hand grab at him under the door. That and the home invasion by the aliens though, were the only scary things that i saw. Also, and this is what the worst thing was, was that it was unrealistic. I mean, if we were invaded by extra terrestrials with superior technology and intelligence, you would think that we would have had a harder time fighting and defeating them. Also, why would intelligent alien beings sensitive to water invade a planet over two thirds water?  So if you don't have anything better to do, it can be entertaining, but don't have high expectations.",Signs

But it deliverson every level, emerging as one of those rare films you lookforward to seeing again even as you're watching it.Shyamalan is a master of subtlety: he frequently puts his audiencein a position from which they will be able to generate their ownsense of fear without ever having to resort to cheap shock tactics.And just to round off his talents, he also turns in a goodperformance! It's a moving film too, Gibson, who has rarely beenbetter, largely responsible for that with a deft portrayal of a manwith both inner demons and impeccable moral standards.

It is an illustration of Divine Providence. Once the viewer sees this, he can appreciate the film for what it truly is.

Saw it a moment ago for the second or maybe the third time, and I must say that I still get a bit scared. The atmosphere and feeling of every single minute in this movie is outstanding! Mel Gibsons character is a former priest who lost his belief when his wife died. He lives with his two kids and his younger brother in a farmhouse. One day they see some strange patterns in the corn field, and there the story begins. Joaquin Phoenix who plays the brother is as good as always. The eerie and creepy atmosphere is more and more significant the further in you come. The negative things about Signs is that in some points its quite excessive. For an example, some scenes are very obvious and its a bit too cheesy! But as a summary:Nice story, good actors, and quite a scare if its your first time! A movie thats in my opinion very well made!

Here some of the most obvious goofs/annoyances:1. Aliens communicating at baby-phone frequencies, so that our heroes can listen to their communication. Even worse, the movie-makers didn't even find it necessary to come up with something that at least sounds good, they are simply playing some random noise in exceedingly long, as well as completely unnecessary scenes.2. Why the hell did they show themselves in the night (the lights floating above cities), and then decided to hide themselves during the day? Just so that the ""dead pigeon"" proof can be used? It was not even very original.3. They get burned by water, and yet they run around completely naked, on a planet, where water is just about *everywhere*.4. Speaking about naked - they also seem to be un-armed: an alien race, attacking earth, is effectively stopped by a rotten old basement door. Extremely convincing.5. So, they're on the raid. What the hell did they look for on a farm with 4 poor souls? Were they out for ex-reverends? Old amateur league baseball bats?6. On the one hand, they can run and jump way faster/higher than normal people can. On the other hand, they seem to be so fragile, that one weak strike with a knife can instantly cut their fingers off.7. Why did the aliens go away? No explanation. Why, exactly, did they come? No explanation.I could go on and on, but I guess you get my point.The whole flick serves only one purpose: it's a religious propaganda movie, with the ending so predictable (""the fallen reverent finds his faith again"") that it makes one sick in the stomach.Rubish, rubbish, rubbish - I wasted 2 hours of my life.",Signs

Night Shyamalan: a lethal combination,10,11 February 2005,"I rated this movie with a ten because I like the movie, obviously, and because I think that it is a bit more than a horror movie. Many of us have had thoughts about aliens and about them trying to take over the world but this movie is the only one I've seen which also has other people implicated in the story. By this I mean that the action is not based only in the USA and it doesn't end in the USA, a big difference between this movie and the X-Files(for example) or The Faculty(recommended). The movie also presents a whole new reason why the aliens want to take over the world and also uses the crop signs as a very innovative guideline.Also the way they manage to defeat them is very ""new"" All in all I think the movie is worth the time and the money spent.",Signs
853,Cpartak,Disappointed,5,15 March 2005,"I'm a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan and immensely enjoyed his other three films. However, I feel that all the things which were great about ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Village"", and ""Unbreakable"" are contrasted by the disappointing and predictable ""Signs"". This film would be considered a dud for an ordinary director, but I am especially disappointed since it was made by a higher caliber of filmmaker in M. Night Shyamalan. Almost all of the elements that make his other films great are missing from ""Signs"". To me, this movie seems like a cheap imitation of Shyamalan's other three films. There is a small number of redeeming factors which I will get to first, however they are few and far between. First of, as in all of his other films Shyamalan does a great job of directing. I really enjoy the way he uses the camera and the abstract angles at which he prefers to shoot some of his scenes. The only other aspect of this movie that I liked was Mel Gibson's performance. There are only a handful of other actors that can bring so much humility and sincerity to a character. Gibson truly is a superb actor and his performance is absolutely top notch. The compliments, however, pretty much end here.One of the most disappointing things about this film is that the plot simply doesn't hold water (no pun intended for those who've seen it). You watch it for two hours and at the end you're left wondering what truly was the point. Shyamalan attempts to convey a message of belief, or the loss of, in God and in other things that human beings have been debating over for thousands of years. Yet it's hard to take away any kind of serious message when you're looking at some alien that belongs in a corny 1950's horror film. Simply put, this message along with the film both miss the mark completely. Unlike the other three Shyamalan films, ""Signs"" left me completely devoid of any true feelings or thoughts. I think that ""Stuart Litte"" (which was written by M. Night) had a more profound message than did ""Signs"". What is most disappointing is that like them or not, Shyamalan's other films at least made you think. ""Signs"", on the other hand, only made me wonder what it was that Shyamalan was thinking when he made this film.",Signs

It goes by the theory of ""Don't give away the monster until the last 5 minutes."" This theory works wonders and I wish more writers and directors would follow suit. The idea of messing with the viewer's mind is amazing,instead of the instant gratification of showing the monster in the first five minutes crap. Another great feature of this and all of M. Night Shyamalan's films are the child actors.  They are just great in their believability and delivery. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix put in wonderful performances as well.

867,info-110,The Emperor's new clothes,1,27 October 2002,"Mr. Shyamalan's first blockbuster ""The Sixth Sense"" was a phenomenon - not for its quality but for being one of the most overrated movies in decades. Still it had its entertaining moments and the deliberate pace was a recuperation from common Hollywood fare and the maniacal mutilation of scenes by cutting frenziedly around the characters you are supposed to watch and listen to.  Then came ""Unbreakable"" which already was a serious let-down.  And now we have ""Signs.""  A movie with a plot so dull that it makes Ed Wood an inspired filmmaker in comparison.  A movie so ridiculously xenophobic that it could even make John Milius a serious candidate for the Nobel peace prize.  And this inane mess, that ""Signs"" is, comes from the self-appointed emperor of the esoteric and religious thriller?!  When will that kid in the crowd finally step up and point at Mr. Shyamalan exclaiming ""But the emperor doesn't wear any clothes.""",Signs

870,velahugo,One of the worse horror movies I have ever seen.,1,14 September 2002,"This looks like a movie that was made for kids. There is not a single moment where I felt really scared. Sure, there are a few times when you might be shaken up because of a stunning moment in the film, but there are basically no more than 3. Instead of being scared, I was laughing a lot more during the movie.I also noted that M. Night Shyamalan, (the director), does not know how to be a team player. Not only he directed, produced and wrote the film,  he also decided to play a role in it. What for? After watching his two prior films, The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I came to realize that he falls in the same cliche over and over. He always wants to make a twist and a breakthrough at the end of each film for the audience to marvel themselves, but this time, the trick did not exactly work. However, it seems that the American society likes to watch the same things, so I guess I have to give him the credit of knowing how to sell his product.I am starting to think that Shyamalan's ability of creating original ideas, is running out, for none of them so far outcomes his first hit, The Sixth Sense. I am hoping that he comes up with something smarter next time, otherwise, I will definitely never recommend any of his movies again.Be smart, and do not waste your money, wait till it comes on T.V.",Signs

The main characters are two kids in the range of 6 to 12 years, along with Mel Gibson and some other guy. I would hesitate to call this a sci-fi, it's much more of a drama about religion and family than about UFO's and crop circles. Finally the movie does not even try to answer anything and leaves the viewer quite empty.",Signs
872,bradshaw-pm,Disappointing !!,5,5 July 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan broke out with his first film, The Sixth Sense, a movie that may very well prove to be both his best and most popular. There are worse fates that creating a cultural touchstone in film your first time out. He followed this with what some thought of as the disappointing Unbreakable. In that line of thought, I must agree that his movie about comic book superheroes looked anything but super. But most of that can be attributed to the cinematographer. In its defense, part of the point was to have the film look mundane. It was about a person who discovers that he's a superhero. It's only a surprise to him if his life looks plain and ordinary, like everyone else's.SIGNS cinematography is much better, more in line with Shyamalan's first film, but in all other ways, plot, pacing, characters, it's a weaker film.Many reviewers have complained about the emotionless nature of M. Night's characters, and he fairs no better here. There are no characters in this film, just caricatures. There is ""the brainy kid"" who is also ""the kid who won't forgive one parent for the other parent's death."" Not that the child's a bad actor, not at all, but he's a Culkin. And let's face it, all the little Culkin Clones make you think about beating the crap out of Joe Pesci on Christmas Eve, not their character.Then there's ""the cute kid' who is also ""the kinda creepy kid."" Unfortunately, Kinda Creepy Kid was already done, and much better, by Haley Joel Osment, in Shyamalan's own The Sixth Sense.Next, we have Gladiator's ever-creepy Juaquim Phoenix, not as Mel Gibson's son, but as his brother. Now, I'm not saying it's impossible, but it is distracting. I'm sure there's at least 20 years difference in age between Gibson and Phoenix, and on screen it looks more like 30. Brothers? The theater-of-reality is blown in the first scene.Phoenix's character is an ex-minor league baseball player, for no apparent reason except that it's a convenient plot device when it comes time to beat the bad guy in the last reel. He doesn't play baseball anymore, despite the fact that he holds the minor league record for the longest hit, at 507 feet. With an arm like that, why isn't he playing ball in the big leagues, much less not playing at all? The only reason given is that he also holds the record for the most strike-outs. Sounds like a man who's played in the majors in Cleveland for a decade, called Jim Thome. Someone should have told M. Night that the top 8 hitters in major league baseball all had more than 100 strike-outs each their last two seasons each. And that even back when Babe Ruth was the home run leader, he was also the holder of the record for the most strike-outs. So it just doesn't add up.And don't forget the town sheriff who's a woman and may be a love interest for the male lead. The only problem with her is that we just had a town sheriff who's a woman and may be a love interest for the male lead last year, in The Mothman Prophecies. And Laura Linney actually had the opportunity to add a little thing called DEPTH to the character. The actress here is just another cardboard cut-out, that ultimately could've been cut completely from the film without anyone noticing.But the award for cardboard cut-out character and winner of the prestigious Kevin Costner Wooden Indian Actor Award goes to Mel Gibson. For the first time in film, the man is emotionless, joyless, and humorless. He plays a reverend who's lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. One problem with this is that we saw this character ALSO, just a few years ago when we watched Harvey Keitel play a reverend who's lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. Again, with the unfortunate result that the THEFT of this tired, Stock Character was also bad choice, as that even in that ""We-Know-We're-Making-a-B Movie"" film (From Dusk Till Dawn), Keitel was much much better.We never believe that Mel Gibson has lost his faith. We don't believe it when his faith is restored (like we don't see that coming), and I don't believe he's a reverend in the first place. At all. Ever. Instead, he walks through the film like the ghost of an actor who used to be allowed to act, or in lieu of that, to at least play the part of Mel Gibson, Superstar. There's nothing to care about in this character, nothing to root for, and nothing heroic. Welcome to the City of Dullsville, Population: Mel.And let's not forget plot points that make no sense. 'You've locked what you think might be an alien in the pantry.' Do you A) Peek inside to see if you're right; B) Call a neighbor or friend to check with you; C) Go get a weapon, then check; or D) Call in the police ? Why, it's none of the above. It's obviously E) Just go home and forget about it.While the cinematography and music are both good, gone is the sense of doom around the corner. There are no plot twists, or what-ifs. What starts off as ""What if crop circles were made by aliens"" ends with ""crop circles were made by aliens."" Mel's faith is restored, but with no real reason, nor does he seem glad that it is.Not a bad movie by any means, Signs is still the lesser brother of Unbreakable, as Unbreakable was to the Sixth Sense.* * * * * * * * * * Rating: C -",Signs
873,hutbay,People fall into two categories!,8,5 August 2002,"Let me start by saying that this movie has an awesome casting. I will try to do include my comment without revealing anything. Aliens are coming and as you would know this. Signs are some how connected to this, but thats only the part of the plot. This is not a movie about alien or crop circles, theres more to the plot. But the talented director Shyamalan never let his audiences slip away or get distracted by it. He created the tense atmosphere through our emotions, the fear of unknown. The soundtrack, acting , atmosphere with our imagination can do wonder. Can anyone say Hitchcock? This is one of the movies you need to watch this summer..Keep looking for the signs!

874,SptJR414,Spellbinding.,7,3 August 2002,"In this movie I went in simply looking for M. Night Shamylan to prove himself to me a third time.  The Sixth Sense was absolutely amazing, and Unbreakable, although not nearly as good, wasn't as bad as critics made it out to me.  Yet with Signs, Shamylan has really written a screenplay that proves he can do great things.  His direction is extraordinary.  Once again he has made children, not ordinarily great actors, shine...and he has mixed comic relief in with masterful suspense.  The film is thorougly entertaining, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Well-written parts include a film laced with the question of faith, of the existence of God...and the movie is layered with an element of hope even in its darkest moments, something I believe to be symbolic of God. Extra terrestrials are seen only a few times in the film, but when they come they make you jump and they come at exactly the right times.  Also, hand it to the people behind the scenes who worked on the sound.  This film's sound is among the best of the year, and the music score, which is composed of mainly three notes played in a haunting and beautiful way is great and makes the film terrifying in a way that movies like Scream and Halloween couldn't do with their violent predictible moments blotched all over.  While I am glorifying this film and making it out to sound perfect, there are still plot incositincies and moments that aren't quite as great as others.  Still, this movie, while not as good as Sixth Sense, has proven Shamylan can tell a story as well as anyone in Hollywood. 8/10.",Signs

Everybody was flopping around and screaming, wanting to get out their seats even though they knew it was pure spooky fun.No PG13 movie has had its audience spooked-out like this since ""Independence Day"", another alien flick.  M. Night Shaylaman's thrill-ride has us jumping out of our seats to laughing our heart out to damping up our tissues. Everything except finishing popcorn.This is a pure favorite of the summer that I would recommend a whole family to see.  Yes, I know it's for teens and above, but deep down in the film's ghostly heart, there is a gentle sensitiveness towards the young ones. While Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix start the struggling pain, Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin, brother of you-know-who, ease it.Every piece of dialogue is an essential character, while every fragment of cinematography is viewed as a piece of art, whether it is symmetry or a from an eagle's eye level.With an ending that's unlike Shaylaman's tales, you'll cry out joy and go back to the box office.",Signs

We are supposed to believe that a race of aliens with the scientific knowledge to perform space travel decided to invade a planet that is 75% covered in water, which is deadly to the creatures. I know, it seems ludicrous to have this ruin the movie. However are we not supposed to be drawn into the storytelling? I was until the end.

880,magic_rich,Shyamalan is the master of suspense,8,24 September 2002,"What can I say about this movie, I loved every minute of it. Shyamalan is a master of suspense and he certainly managed it with Signs, without incorporating really any action, and the few effects shots were also done superbly. One bit in the film I guarantee will have you jumping out of your seat, I actually reacted similar to Merrill (with the addition of a few well known words). Overall, this movie was brilliantly done. there was brilliant acting all round (one thing that I think puts this ahead of 'Unbreakable') and I was glued to the screen practically all of the time wondering what was going to happen next.Very highly recommended, but I would not recommend watching it in an empty cinema (mine was full and I'm still going to have trouble sleeping tonight).",Signs
881,knutsindre,"Creepy, symbolic and well done, but it's message has problems",6,10 November 2012,"I sort of like this movie. Taken as a horror or science fiction movie, it might not live up to many of its peers, but if one takes the plot as a symbolic exploration of the struggle with faith, it has some value. This is a spiritual movie.Visually it's well done in an old fashioned style, and at times really scary. Sudden violin bursts and reveals makes for brief tachycardia episodes with good effect. The entire presentation gives a sense of isolation of it's characters, and the house where the main plot happens, which plays on the feelings of the protagonist. The suspense is good too, and the viewer is left wondering what will happen. Also, the gradual reveal of the past is well done, and not too overstated.But for me, the ""punchline"" of the movie, as it is revealed, is oversimplified and overstated. Without spoiling, I can say that things come together well - too well. Also, the final message of this movie looses itself in the mistake that the same message has when provided elsewhere by people of faith: it ignores the massive suffering outside of the single event that is valued and taken as a sign. All in all, worth a watch for the suspense and occasional thrill, but be critical of its message - this movie adds nothing in that respect.",Signs
882,SuzLouA,"There never has been, nor never will be, another film quite like it.",10,18 September 2002,"SORT OF SPOILERS... I don't think they are, but you know, I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I've described a couple of scenes vaguely, but I'm pretty sure you won't understand until you see it. So read at your own risk, kinda. :)
I don't post comments very often, but sometimes a film will push me that bit further.Signs is one of those films...The basic story of Signs is crop circles, even the ultra-mysterious trailers revealed that much. The first scene in the film leaps straight into ol' Mel (Father Graham Hess) finding the first circles in his fields, and it goes from there. Graham lives with his two kids, Bo (Breslin) and Morgan (Culkin), and his brother Merrill (Phoenix, getting worryingly sexy now). The film is basically about them being a bit confused and scared by the circles, resulting in a climax that, as in all M. Night Shyamalan films, makes you smack your head and go ""ohhhh! Now it all makes sense!"".Sounds a bit dull? Well, think again. Like, for example, American Beauty, Signs is one of those films that you know is very very good, you're just, erm, not sure why. (Ask anyone to answer the question ""What is American Beauty about?"" and watch with amusement as they go ""Well, I don't know really....it's about this guy, and his daughter, and his wife, and his next door neighbour, and pot, and life, and death..."") Of course, the plot of Signs is difficult to describe more because you don't want to give anything away than because you CAN'T describe it. Even tiny details and idiosynchrosies that appear to just be character development all interweave to form the aforementioned head-smacking ending.The one remarkable thing I can say about Signs is that I have never ever seen a film before that has made me repeatedly laugh til I cried (think the ""helmets"", especially when all three are wearing them...) with the most deadpan humour known to man; has made me cry (Graham's final flashback); and has scared the living bejesus out of me (peeking under the pantry door). It was almost Rocky Horroresque in it's audience participant factor; believe me, apart from at the end of Moulin Rouge when everyone sat still for a few seconds, I have never seen English audiences seem to get into the film so much. But tonight you heard people gasp, yell ""What the hell are you doing?"" and in the case of one particularly annoying woman in the row behind, scream.People believed in it. And not because run, run, the aliens are chasing Jeff and Will; or because aaah, it's the end of the world, and for some reason this means Bruce saying those immortal words ""Dig dig dig, let's chew this iron bitch up!"". No, it's because Night is a director who actually gets that nothing, NOTHING on screen will ever be as scary as your imagination. Except that unlike, say, Blair Witch, Night also has this little thing called a ""script"", which helps with the whole keeping you interested bit.Well, this review has probably read like a mindless stream of thoughts and movie disses, and if you are still reading, well done. That's because the only thing I can say about Signs boils down to four words:See it. RIGHT NOW.(and if you don't laugh, cry, and jump, come round and I'll give you a tenner.)",Signs
883,rackshackb,Wow....,10,5 August 2002,"I saw ""Signs"" on Saturday and I was absolutely amazed!  It was BETTER than""Unbreakable"", and I thought that was going to be hard to beat.  Previouscomments have said that it's not laden with special effects and that would be correct, but that is what makes the movie so suspenseful and slightly disturbing. This is a thinking person's movie, and shouldn't be seen by people who want to be fed every important detail. M. Night Shamaylan is absolutely brilliant, and following in his previous movies, he casts himself, only this time, he has a MUCH bigger role than he had in either of his two previous movies.  His acting is impressive as is his directing. The rest of the cast is brilliant, except for maybe Rory Culkin, who I thought played a pretty two-dimensional character, who at times was two melodramatic andruined some scenes.  Abigail Breslin is so cute and the turmoil that she feels doesn't feel fake.  Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful and brought a great sense of youth to the movie, a factor that ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" werelacking.  And Mel Gibson as a former pastor is incredible. 
Perhaps the best part about this film is that the director keep building andbuilding the suspense, so you expect  a big-fallout-finale, and instead heexposes something quiet and subdued, and yet it moved me much more thanany bunch of special effects could, because it isn't until the end that youunderstand the whole movie.Go see ""Signs"" if you're a fan of M. Night Shamaylan and/or if you willing to expand you're mind and see the greater meaning behind the film. 10/10",Signs
884,neale_graham,The signs point to a terrible film,1,8 October 2002,"Contains spoilersWhen The Sixth Sense was released three years ago, the previously unheralded M. Night Shyamalan found himself with one hell of a hit on his hands.  I watched it with the hype in mind and didn't particularly enjoy it.  Yes, the plot twist was good but the rest of the film meandered without aim. Shyamalan's follow-up Unbreakable was given a harder time by critics and audiences alike.  I liked it, certainly more than The Sixth Sense, but it was not a film that lingered long in the memory.  It was one of those films that you didn't really need to see in the cinema, which is damning it with faint praise but there you go.  So it was with some trepidation, and as I was to discover, foolhardiness, that I paid my money to see Signs.  I had been warned off it but there was nothing else to see and two hours to kill.I'll get to the point: this film was about as lame as it gets.  It was in essence more of the same slop from Shyamalan.  One could argue that it's his individualism, a trademark style that permeates all his films.  I would argue it is plain laziness.  If Shyamalan is trying to make as much money as possible with as little effort, then this film embodies that attitude. Each of his films has a premise that is initially a good one - in Signs it is the ever-intriguing argument of fate versus coincidence.  However, Shyamalan fails to flesh out this concept beyond a hushed conversation between Gibson and Phoenix.  It is a total waste of a good idea, certainly on a film that quickly falls into the usual 'aliens are coming' trap.  I might have been more prepared to accept such a tired old routine if the aliens had done something other than bang a few doors and create immaculate crop circles. How is the audience supposed to buy into the supposed fear of the characters when the intergalactic enemy makes little more nuisance than a bored teenager?  The aliens weakness is water, exactly the same as that of Bruce Willis' character in Unbreakable.  Shyamalan is recycling his own ideas! Give me strength.  And his insistence on putting religion at the heart of his work irks me greatly - the motto of 'keep the faith and everything will be alright' is mawkish, indolent and unrealistic.How many more times can filmmakers expect the public to believe that the alien on screen is not just a tall guy in a green jumpsuit?  The scene where you are given your first glimpse of the invaders in a South American home movie is laughable.  When are we going to see some imagination used in cinematic close encounters?  Are they all going to have heads, legs and arms?  A dodgy extra-terrestrial might have been passable if the story was any good.  It's not.  For a film knocking on for two hours long, absolutely nothing happens.  Instead you get the usual 'deep' Shyamalan dialogue, which is in fact pretentious bullshit, trying to mask the absence of plot.  His direction is based upon building an eerie atmosphere but if there's nothing going on within that, the viewer is left with nothing to get their teeth in. The film drags its feet so often that I'm surprised it didn't trip over and fall out of the projector.  Gibson fails to convince as a man of the cloth (he's too gnarled for that s**t), Phoenix's Merrill is an intense weirdo with some bizarre, apropos of nothing lines and the two kids are plain irritating (they hired a Culkin for Christ's sake).By the time the alien that visits the family farm is killed off - in a manner so damn corny it challenges belief - I was looking forward to doing something other than watch this sorry mess.  It cost a reported $70m to make which is arguably the biggest shock of the whole movie.  I shall never see another M. Night Shyamalan film as long as I live.  He is being spoken of as the next Steven Speilberg (from whom he borrowed a couple of suspense-evoking techniques for this film) but such a suggestion couldn't be wider of the mark.  Spielberg can enchant, enthral but above all entertain. When Shyamalan learns to do any of these, somebody let me know.  He is, however, a fine con artist, capable of extracting millions of pounds from the public in return for absolutely nothing.  If you cannot see through this wafer thin film then you deserve to be visited by a tall man in a green costume in the middle of the night.  Just have a baseball bat or a glass of water handy...",Signs
885,drake blueskull,A Sci-fi replete with all the elements of a modern classic,10,11 September 2002,"What can you say about faith and Cinema? Its not like the domain is new from the Cinema standpoint. The lilting ring of 'May the force be with you' might justifiably be considered as one of the reasons why Star Wars is STAR WARS. 'The Excorcist' wouldn't be half as good if, in the end, the devil won. Or what about superheroes? Gotham wouldn't have a peaceful night without Batman, because superheroes are but demigods. For decades now, cinema has fashioned its offerings in a way that has perpetually comforted our faith & beliefs & given them a polished second voice. But the question always is how good has the point been driven? If the patterns of a chunk of cinematic offerings are similar, then how exactly do you rate a film from another? That is where the story and the storyteller come into play. M. Night Shyamalan is a gem of a storyteller and Signs is one gem of a film. The genius of Shyamalan gives new identity to the thriller, as he steers clear of conventional generic perceptions. No matter what aspect of Signs you explore, you'd be convinced that Shyamalan belongs right up there with the likes of Spielberg, Kazan, Coppola & Hitchcock.Signs is the story of Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) who loses his faith when his wife dies in a freak accident, leaving the task of bringing up their two children to Graham and his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Six months later the household wakes up to find mysterious crop circles in their fields. As the family comes to terms with this incident, it gradually becomes apparent that these signs have been made by extra terrestrials and the world is on the brink of alien domination. Apart from battling for the safety of his family Graham experiences a deeper turmoil - Is faith really the solution to his fears?All those who expect the film to be an 'aliens vs mankind' showdown, would be disappointed. Indeed, 'Signs' is not 'Independence Day' revisited in an albeit domestic and scaled down avatar. But that does not stop 'Signs' from being the riveting classic that it is. The film is fulfilling in every aspect of film-making. The performances are top-notch and strong. Mel Gibson, as the widower responsible for two children and a brother, delivers magnificently in a role that couldn't be less in league with his action-hero image. In fact he revels astonishingly in some of the poignant scenes of the film. Joaquin Phoenix follows up his turn in 'Gladiator' with another constrained performance and reveals a genuine comic talent. Once again, Shyamalan extracts remarkable performances from child actors. Rory Culkin is terrific as Morgan and looking at Abigail Breslin, you'd hardly believe that she's 'acting'. The musical score of James Newton Howard goes in perfect sync with the film's moods. Shyamalan's direction retains the edginess he's become famous for, and the pace of the film is unpredictable & never complacent. The camerawork is brilliant as every scene in the film assumes a consistent atmosphere of tension. And even though the anticipation never really kills you, you'd admit that you never really thought that the sound of a dog barking could be this disturbing!All said and done, it is good to see a film that does not struggle under the burden of the topic it addresses. Seeing the story unfold, the concept of quelling fears with faith assumes new importance. The film dwells into everyday territory and offers the same perspective we have, but somehow, due to Shyamalan's direction perhaps, it evokes a new respect for miracles and coincidences as you walk out of the hall. Signs is science-fiction attempted with an approach that is individualistic and perhaps even spiritual. An engaging film that is arguably replete with all the elements of a modern classic.",Signs

Everyone/anyone can come up with the hook, but the key is being able to sustain interest right up to the end and deliver a satisfying pay-off. A good example of a successful pay-off is a film like ""Shawshank Redemption"" or, on the action side, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".Night manages the events in this story almost like a bomb squad diffusing an explosive device. He's careful and meticulous. There's no doubt a lot of hard work and careful consideration went into the design of this story -- up to a point.***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT*** It almost would have been better for the film if there were no aliens. And these particular aliens are amazingly stupid. Water kills them so they decide to try and conquer a planet that is 7/10 comprised of water.

The shock moments were well timed and made even me jump, and that takes a lot.The one thing that surprised me was that Shyamalan added some funny parts; the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were much more serious in comparison.

However, that was not it at all. They barely even go into the crop circles, they pretty much simply explain them in about one line and out of the movie. *What spoiled it for me* ~first off, the aliens themselves. They looked so dumb they pretty much took all of the suspense out of the movie, because I was not scared of them at all. ~M. Night Shyamalan cameo as the man who kills Graham's wife. His performance, for the most part, was very bad. He just had this glazed look and stared in one spot as he delivered his line in this scene that was supposed to be very emotional for Graham when he finally talks to the man that is responsible for his wife's death. ~It said in the movie the aliens were invading to take our resources. Yet they are allergic to water. The earth is mostly made up of water, so that part made absolutely no sense to me. *What I DID like* ~I must say, I did appreciate the acting in this film. Mel Gibson was very good, as always, in his role and I thought he only topped himself in this one. Abigail Breslin, the little girl who plays Bo, is the cutest thing I've seen and I thought she did a very good job as well. The rest of the cast was amazing also. ~I did like the ending, when it is all summed up and Mel Gibson gets his faith back and realized his wife's death had meaning.

Night said in an interview...and i'm para-phrasing...it is truely one of the most original films this summer has to offer...I mean it had some big names to contend with, MIB 2, Austin Powers, however they cannot compete...they can't...some of you may think they were great, but they were not completely new ideas...they were building off of the first, or the sequel...this however...""Signs"", was something that looked ok, seemed different, but turned out to be great.I love the way the story evolves, and how it has a meaning to it, you really gain an understanding for the characters in it and it's not just a horror film. It has the feel of a kind of anxieity, you want to see what's going to happen next, it keeps leading you...and when you finally understand what it's all about it has a depth that most horror/sci-fi films don't.So, It's good to finally get out of the muck of stupid, mindless, films that leave you feeling nothing...and hit the jackpot with a movie that has heart, humor, and horror! The cast was great, the setting, everything, just great...and it is the kind of movie that I go home thinking about.

In the beginning the plot in the film is quite interesting and I was enjoying myself seeing it. The ""feeling"" of this movie is really scary. In the end however I ended up somewhat disappointed about the overall plot. I think it just was not developed to its very best and it was just too elusive.

897,jansd,Brutal Clicheique Self loving parade,1,30 August 2002,"Contains Spoilers!!! I was so excited to see a movie done by such a young guy given the reigns,cover of Newsweek! even, and his having done a great job with ""Sixth Sense"", but WOW!.. this will become a cult film on how many cliches and unoriginal thoughts you can pack in to one movie, and still bore the s..t out of everyone--unless you're 6 or something, and all this stuff would be fresh... and you haven't seen the Wizard of Oz yet.(that's how they get the aliens to sizzle with water, yes I know, brutal,,but it gets better)  Also, I'm puzzled! why did he have to appear in the movie?.. answer: He completel y loves himself and believes his hyper-greatness to the point of embarrassment. Sure, everyone has heard of Indian men being misogynistic, but to weave it in to American film is a huge HUGE no no.  For example, during a kitchen scene when Mel(bless his heart, as this will be his last blockbuster budget film after this stinker)he has the little kids washing dishes as he comes back all freaked out from seeing this thing in cornfield..what little kids wash dishes without being beaten to do so?.. ok, so anyway, the little girl is splashing water on Rory Culkin, and Rory is sitting there taking it, not knocking her off her little step, like a little bro is supposed to.. why.. because Night sees women as powerless, and especially little girls.. because they will grow up to be women.. and ergo powerless in his society.. so let them have their fun now.. or believe they will have power when they are young.. to hide them from the nasty truth for women in non-American society.. for shame.  Keep that for an Indian film.. not an American one. There were so many hilarious cliches.. boarding up the camera to change the scene.. i laughed out loud, or Mel's wife sitting there crushed by a car, and she's sitting there hanging out with him, saying yeah,, this sucks, tell the kids to do their homework..and that I love them, and isn't this a pisser? i think he would be hugging her.. kissing her.. running over to her immediately, not waiting for the highway patrolwoman to calmly explain to him his wife is almost dead. so David Lynchy, but yet not supposed to be!.. or in the beginning when the car starts up! (sound effects) before the patrolwoman is fully in the car.. Ok.. maybe i'm being hyper critical, or reading more into this than I need to.. but BOY this was so bad!! i might have to see it again.. Mel rams the needle in poor rory's leg so hard at the end, he would break the needle off in the poor kid.. ""Oh.. Oh,, don't speak.. let's see if he's going to live.. we don't know yet.. he.. he.. didn't breath in the poison because his lungs were closed..""(actual line) At least color the kid's skin blue so we know that he is out of breath for the last 3 minutes if he was going to paint it to the dumbass public so blatantly.. which he did several times throughout the movie.. flat out explaining obvious things to us.. so we could said ""oh, yeah, yeah, I thought so"".  Joaquin Phoenix.. who is an AWESOME actor.. seemed to be rolling his third eye within his head at having to say some of these stale lines, I would love to laugh my ass off with him about the filming of this.. because I bet there was alot of tongue biting.

This may disturb you...When I first pressed ""play"" button, all I knew about ""Signs"" is that something weird is going to happen on Mel Gibsons' characters' corn field. May be Steven King rising from the soil, or even something more terrible. Fortunately, it was nothing like that. Soon it became clear that it's definitely not rednecks vs. aliens type of movie. And it still scared. It's been a long since I almost jumped out of my chair last time. But ""Signs"" made me do it again. Thanks to all the film crew for that. No guts, gore, jaws, tentacles, torn body parts and other ""meat"" stuff.It is the presence that make you nervous. Presence of something unknown with intentions not clear. It's throughout the movie, all the way. You are scared by what you do NOT see. And when you finally do... The scene representing Merrill being watching a ""genuine birthday video"" is just great. First, TV host warns you, that you WILL see. Then children will point you WHERE you will see. You think to yourself: ""Oh, now it finally will appear. Right now, right there"". And it does. Exactly where you were supposed to. Still a shock. Look at Joaquin Phoenixs' face, then go look to a mirror. By the way, I found out, that in Russian translation they slightly altered the original TV womans' words to something like ""I hate to say... I'm afraid this is real"". Some personality touch, hmm...I liked the humour, too. It's not much fun usually in such situations, when there's ""the same show an all channels"", as we all now know for sure. But comic stuff happens, whether we want it or not. Well, it looks fun mostly to the viewer, not the characters, but still entertains.And after all, this is not horror or thriller or anything like that movie. It deals with faith (not necessarily in divine), the way we are facing the problems and trouble, no matter of what cause them.Read forth if you saw the film already. Else see first. (No spoilers, one just got to see the movie to get sense of what am I talking about).As final credits rolled, I was up to two questions. First - am I the miracle man, or not. And you? That is a harder choice that it may seem. Graham seriously doubts on answer too. And it looks to me that Merrill has nearly changed his mind at some point of the movie. And that leads us to the second question - in what we will believe, if the things will suddenly go the way they did in the movie. What if one day there will be the same show on all channels again...

899,zimm44,major disappointment in 2002,1,9 July 2003,"Sorry to say but I see only the young talent wasted here. ""Unbreakable"" left me thinking that Shyamalan used the same formula known from his intense and amazing ""The Sixth Sense"" but,despite that, had some good scenes (like Bruce touching people and getting to know their deeds).""The Signs"" recreates the same intimate atmosphere but all the elements that S. skillfully uses to create the suspence vanish when we reach to the idiotic finale.It was like the massive orchestra with the skillful conductor after building the theme suddenly started to play Britney Spears song. All those delicate elements, development of the plot WASTED!!!!!!!!!!! I wanted to scream in the cinema (not necessarily because I was scared) and certainly I moaned when all turned out to be horrible a rip-off from a class-B horror from the 50's. It was so idiotic that I was hardly able to believe what I saw. Expecting to get to know that there were no aliens (the form of the film and the ""abilities"" of aliens seemed to reinforce my opinion)I saw Mr. Phoenix hitting the alien (who looked like a total cliche)with a bat!!!!! All the magic vanished -only disgust remained. It's one of those movies in which the ending is paramount and decides about the quality and coherence of the film. Here we have - an intelligent suspence thriller preparing the viewers for horrible catastrophe that is the finale. That is why for me it's only 1 / 10",Signs
900,masterandcommander,"Plagued by ruining its own antagonists but liberated by its heroes, suspense, and message",8,8 February 2013,"This was a great film. Unfortunately, its worth is often completely missed by viewers. The only downfall is the villain. Unfortunately, this aspect was also what was making the movie a significantly terrifying movie for the first two thirds! While the evil lurks in the shadows, the suspense of ""Signs"" is unstoppable. Shyamalan successfully emulates Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" but drops the ball in the final act by entering territory Hitchcock wisely avoided; a slapped on explanation. It is not until the lights come on that the movie falters somewhat but not in terms of character; fortunately! This is almost the scariest film I have seen when it comes to the ""fear of the unknown"". Not because the aliens are super scary- LOOKING, but rather because until the end they aren't SEEN much at all. It allows the audience to impress their own fears upon the aliens as is so brilliantly written into the film's best sequence which is a simple conversation on a couch.Shyamalan is best when he doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, but rather when he is putting spinning rims on the wheel. His successful films are all very typical genres but they are given an interesting context that makes them better than the average film within that genre. Ghosts, Superheroes, and Aliens are all done to death. However, the perspectives Shyamalan tells these typical premises helps them transcend the mediocre. It isn't until he tries to coming up with his own original material that things fall apart. Fortunately, there is not too much that goes astray in Signs. He wisely chooses to tell an Alien invasion story from the perspective of a small family rather than the wide-scale epic. This is where Signs really works. Realistic characters are simply non-existent in alien invasion flicks to begin with. And yet, in this one, they are the centerpieces. They are also acted exceptionally well all around! That alone is why most people disliked this one oddly enough. They wanted aliens frying people and instead got something a lot deeper. This is simply no discredit to the film itself, in my opinion. Plain and simple, this movie, like all of Shyamalan's flicks, should be viewed as a unique film because it has a highly unique perspective. This film explores the concept of how people react in terrifying circumstances. Do you believe that everything is just coincidences and you are alone, or do you read the events as signs of some higher power? For this reason, the film is entirely a dramatic, supernatural, and psychological thriller, and clearly not some mindless horror gore fest or a typical alien invasion romp. Furthermore, the ""signs"" aren't the literal crop circles. All the ""signs"" in the film are shown in the finale and we are left wondering if it was all just luck or part of a plan just as the main characters point out in the previous conversation. It is left to the characters and ultimately the viewer as to what they make of them...In the end, this movie is very terrifying but at the same time immensely beautiful and character-driven. The final act succeeds in completing the main character's arch but unfortunately threw in a little too much information regarding the villains which spoils some of their impact and shows the ""face of the devil"". It pulls a ""The Mist"" and suddenly takes an unnecessary turn into left field when it was doing just fine. Yet, in comparison to ""The Mist"" which abandons both its mystery and its characters, ""Signs"" abandons its mystery but preserves and elevates its characters.Overall, Shyamalan really accomplishes what he set out to do with this one and I believe it deserves more recognition for that.",Signs

903,StevenPlaymountain,"Great science fiction movie, although it is basically a movie about faith and meaning.",9,28 January 2005,"'Signs' is the movie you'll either love or hate. I loved it. To describe it in a nutshell: Close Encounters of the Third Kind meets Hitchcocks 'The birds'. It's a Sci-Fi movie showing a widower (a former preacher) who finds mysterious circles in his crops and the way he deals with this problem. And again, I really, really loved this movie. Sure, it has flaws, but name one movie that doesn't. But for the sake of objectivity I'll sum up some of these imperfections. For example, the introduction of the 'menacing elements' (I call it like this to avoid spoilers) has been done much too sudden and much too overt. As a result the fear-provoking factor is slightly reduced. Still, there's a scene where a home made video reveals those so-called 'threatening elements' very explicitly and I must say, it is one of the scariest moments in the movie. Anyhow, maybe this film lacks the power of suggestion, all the more when compared to Shyamalans other movies. But come on, let's not split hairs. Another 'flaw' is the obligatory end twist. It is after all a movie from the creator of 'The sixth sense', so you can expect a huge eye-opening surprise at the end of the film. I admit, when you have just seen the movie, and you analise the story and all the plot elements, this end twist makes the whole movie seem a bit artificial because every little element in the movie has been introduced for the sake of making this twist plausible. But on the other hand, when you're actually watching the movie, the twist really does work. And I guess that's the most important thing, how you feel while watching it. Any post-movie gibberish is trivial.But like I said before, I loved this movie. First of all the acting is marvelous. One particular emotional scene comes to mind: 'the last supper'-scene. In this scene former preacher Graham Hess (played by Mel Gibson), his brother Merril (played by Joaquin Phoenix) and his children (some will perhaps recognize Macauly Culkins younger brother) are trying to have dinner, but the emotions of fear are just too overwhelming, so they break out in tears. This is really a tear jerking scene. But even in less dramatic scenes the acting is above standard.Another positive element in 'Signs' is the subtle humor, which is rather unseen in the work of Shyamalan. It certainly relieves the constant tension of the story, and therefore it is appropriate within the movie as a whole. What was Shyamalan to do anyway? After all, he hired Mel 'funniest man alive' Gibson. Rest my case.The camera-work in this movie is very artistic and calculated, but I didn't expect any less from this director. So, I won't go into this any further.Some find it a bit restrictive that the movie takes place for almost 95% in the farm-area where the family lives. But to me the limitations of space added to the genuine feeling of imprisonment the family must have had being threatened by unknown forces, and tied to the memory of their departed wife/mother/sister-in-law. This claustrophobic feeling works, just like it did in Shyamalans 'The Village'. What strikes me about Shyamalans movies 'The Village' and 'Signs' is that each of these films is cemented with an universal message. There's always a moral to be found. While the search for pure, unconditional love was the main topic of 'The Village', 'Signs' focuses on the loss of faith and the search for meaning in misery. Okay, being a Shyamalan fan I'm biased, but what the heck: 9,5 out of 10.",Signs
904,Wonderkind,"Clever dialogue, well shot, shaky plot.",6,2 June 2005,"Did somebody forget that water makes up part of the earth's atmosphere? Water vapour is present in the air, we breathe it in AND out. So, I find it somewhat incredible that an alien whose Achille's heel is H2O a)would choose to land on Earth which has vast quantities of the substance -have they never seen the blue planet from above? b)are unaffected by water unless it is thrown on them or preferably smashed onto them by a sentimental swing of a baseball bat. However, despite these obviously huge discrepancies due to an idea which seemed - hey,like a pretty good idea, but wasn't really thought through (I blame this on the director) I think this film is visually brilliant. You weren't expecting that were you? Shymalan directs with startling self-confidence and this film is uncannily good for a paper thin plot. Mel Gibson produces a sterling performance as the Reverend and any film with Phoenix has to be a winner. So, ignore the flaws and enjoy the acting. Enjoy the dialogue, enjoy the suspense and enjoy the camera work. Enjoy the set, enjoy the shiver down your spine as you too feel the fear that the characters do. All I ask, is don't even try to think about the plot realism. Enjoy the film for what it is. It is excellent but oh so fatally flawed.

Was it really as good as my initial reaction?  The answer I think to that is that no, it wasn't.First, the good points.  All of the acting was very good, especially the kid actors.  The script was also excellent, it was the perfect balance of comedy and suspense.  It also has simply, a great plot.  Sure, the whole sci-fi aliens attack movie has been done before, but not as good as this.  Instead of focusing on the world-wide disaster as in other movies, this movie instead focuses on one farming family.  However, by only watching this one small community you still get the feeling of this massive global conflict.Now though, some of the bad points.  First, the thing that angered me the most... a lot of the movie is basically a carbon copy of ""The Birds""... no, not the movie, but the original story; however the birds were merely replaced with aliens.  Many of the details of this plot are taken straight from that story, and that is disappointing.  Second, it is to a point, simply unrealistic.  Why do we not see one pesron with a gun on this farm? We consistently ask ourselves while watching movies about people in big cities ""how did they get that gun"" when they pull one out of nowhere when the character is just to perfectly in need of a gun.  Here though, on a farm where you would expect the owners to keep some sort of weapon, there is none.  Speaking of weapons, why don't the aliens use any?  The final major bad point of the movie is the book that Rory Culkin buys about extraterrestrials.  This book, written purely based on speculation, is 100% factually correct through the entire movie and the characters rely on it to find out what the aliens might try to do.  How convenient is that? 
Enough of my nagging, I'll wrap this up now...  but first, I want to say how I did love the news updates on TV that were added in my Shalayman (sorry if my spelling is inaccurate).  The TV updates are absolutely perfect to show the global chaos forming, the nervous atmosphere of people around the world, and the joy and elation when problems are solved throughout the movie. These brief clips added a lot to this film.I'm extremely glad that I did go to see this movie, as it was 2 hours of good entertainment.  However, with all of the rave reviews of this movie that I've been hearing I have to wonder if people ever thought more about the movie than your original reaction.  My reaction was far different than the one I have about the movie hours after seeing it.",Signs
912,reismark,Unspeakably brilliant,10,5 August 2002,"In last week's issue of Newsweek, M. Night Shyamalan is quoted as saying to his accomplices in crime, ""If I did 'Pokemon 5,' would you come? Come on! I could turn it into a metaphor for the human condition!"" The scary thing about that comment is not only that he probably *could* do it if afforded the opportunity, but also that he pulls off a similar trick in ""Signs,"" which from an artistic standpoint is easily the best film he's ever done.The greater picture of the film is the crop signs that suddenly and quickly start appearing worldwide - and the question of whether they mean anything for mankind as a whole. But once the greater picture is laid out in the first twenty minutes, it takes a complete backseat to Shyamalan's happy & pained family of four, and focuses on their feelings, their worries, their doubts; as the horror of what's transpiring in the greater picture creeps closer to them.When Merrill says, ""It's like War of the Worlds,"" it's NOT hyperbole, even though we never see what transpires in the greater picture. Instead, Shyamalan focuses on the subtle nuances of the fear of the individual. Instead of seeing hundreds of soldiers fighting in hand-to-hand combat with gigantic bugs, we gain an appreciation of what it's like for those who aren't blessed with such courage - or, in Graham Hess' case, being able to find it again.This is the first horror movie I've ever seen that both genuinely scared me - because you sympathize with the family's plight, even without seeing it - and made me laugh at the same time, because the family's reaction to the terror unfolding in the world is a sign itself of a strength that most don't have - the ability to be levelheaded and always keep things in perspective, no matter how scary or ""out-there"" the situation is.As usual, Shyamalan gets excellent performances out of all of his actors, especially Willis & Breslin as Graham & Bo. As usual, everything you see means something - the trick, like with ""Sixth Sense"" & ""Unbreakable, is whether or not you can put them all together. I'd be shocked, though, if this film doesn't get nominated for its sound - the soundtrack is Hitchcockian-creepy, and Shyamalan is a master at using sound effects to create the terror that the visual effects normally do.Don't go to ""Signs"" expecting a monster movie, or a shock ending, but definitely see it before the summer's out, and be prepared to be moved in ways that you previously couldn't have imagined from a horror or suspense film. It's been said that a genius of film is one who knows how to transcend or reinvent a genre - and with this film, M. Night Shyamalan is decidedly on his way there, if he hasn't already reached it. 10/10",Signs
913,mglenn-2,Not very good.,3,16 August 2002,"I was expecting quite a bit more from this film from the flashy trailer. I left the theatre quite dissapointed.  I'm a little mystified at the favorable reviews of this film, probably as much as they are at the unfavorable ones.I think the actors did great, but the script they were acting was horrendous, so that they didn't come off well isn't their fault!  Everyone in his movies ends up playing the same quiet, slow, look around for awhile and say as little as possible kind of roles. I think for movies such as sixth sense this works fabulously...  But here it was just silly. Also, the characters were never developed to the point of making me care much about them.The alien plot was too korny and unrealistic to make anyone feel scared at the ""invasion"", though some of the scenes did work to scare. And I kept getting bothered by the stupid things the actors were doing...  Wouldn't you try to call someone if a live alien was locked in the pantry? Etc...The movie is too slow... Slow can work wonders if used correctly, don't get me wrong.  If used excessively and with too little of a story it just makes you bored.Ok, the losing/regaining faith thing...

Oh well, it didn't get much better.The Newsweek assertion that M.Night is the next Speilberg may unfortunately be true. Not the ""Minority Report"" Speilberg, but the ""ET"" Speilberg, full of unrealistic children performances.

So bloody obvious, so bloody awful.I just saw a low-budget feature called ""Bubba-Ho-tep"" with Bruce Campbell of ""Evil Dead"" fame. With one-twentieth the budget and a clever script, they have crafted a wonderfully entertaining film. Go see this if you can, not ""Signs"".If this is a ""Sign"" of things to come from M.

917,Hylo Bates,"Entertaining movie...funny, suspenseful, all ruined by horrible ending.",3,2 November 2002,"I was very disappointed by this film and surprised that M. Night Shyamalan would produce a work like it.First off, though, the positive:  I like Shyamalan's sense of humor, and it was on display in this movie as in his others.  The scene when Graham comes home to find Merrill on the couch with the children, glued to the TV, and Merrill has joined the children in wearing tin-foil hatsthat was great.  As was the dialogue between Merrill and the Sherrif at the dinner table regarding Scandinavian high-jumpers.  During both these scenes, most in the theater laughed out loud, as did I.  Likewise, Shyamalan knows how to set a scene to produce suspense.  I cringed in anticipation of being startled and scared in two different scenes (the birthday party video, and the knife-reflection under the pantry door).  Both these scenes were masterfully done.I really liked the supporting cast in this movie.  Merrill and the Sherrif were both solid characters and well portrayed.  And the children were cute and added plenty of comic relief (the precocious child who acts like a 50-year-old trapped in a 4-year-old's body is getting to be such a trite, Hollywood stereotype, but I can't hold that against Shyamalan alone).So, this movie made me laugh and cringe and grip the sides of my chair in preparation for a fright.  And then, it made me groan.  And groan.  And shake my head in disgust.  I don't know if Shyamalan read The Celestine Prophecy before writing this script or what, but the cheesy, someone-is-watching-over-us-all message at the end was ridiculous and simplistic.  I don't know if he thought this would be an ending on par with Sixth Sense or if he was actually trying to deliever a message of faith, but either way, he ruined the movie for me.  It went from a good, entertaining movie to garbagenothing more than a two-hour commercial for the Christian Church.  If this is indicitive of Shyamalan's works to come, then it's a shame for the movie industry.  Until this tripe, he had appeared as a bright spot in an industry increasingly formulaic and mundane.",Signs
918,kimiles,Night Shyamalan continues to impress,10,4 August 2002,"I have waited eagerly for Shyamalan's next effort, having been slightly disillusioned with ""Unbreakable"" and its similarities to ""The Sixth Sense"". In ""Signs"", however, Shyamalan has moved on and delivered on the promise of the depth of his talent.In trailers, the film presents itself as an invasion movie along the lines of ""Independence Day""; a farmer notices crop circles and then disbelievingly discovers that they are appearing all over the world in similar fashion. Sounds pretty run-of-the-mill.  Was Shyamalan about to succumb to the big-budget blockbuster and sacrifice the intricacy in plot that he has become known for? Not a chance.  He weaves the alien story into the background as we witness a man's struggle with his faith.  Don't get me wrong; there are moments when you can see daylight under people's seats; it's just that Shyamalan has made this film into so much more.He has rediscovered Hitchcockian suspense.  This is not a film about blatant horror; it touches you in a deeper way and fills you with dread.  This is the essence of this type of cinema.  The audience is far more capable of scaring itself; only you know your real fears and only you can truly scare yourself. Shyamalan simply pokes the fire a little, with elegant simplicity.  The result is a film that has moments of terror only dreamed of by the guys with the big effects budgets.He has managed to tell the story with characters that react the same way many of us would, and with scattered moments of very subtle humour, come to life. Here lies the strength in Shyamalan's work; his character development. He understands which aspects of his characters' humanity are important, and which are unimportant, and weaves the audience into their lives in a way few others can.I thought the aliens were well done.  Not knowing myself what an invading alien should look like, I was more than willing to accept Shyamalan and ILM'sinterpretation.  It worked for me.As for comments about black screen and nothing but sound effects and dark lighting (by Tak Fujimoto, ASC, one of the most well-respected living DPs in cinema), these things are the keys to suspense cinema.  The deprivation of information is far more effective than the proliferation of effects.  If you still have to ask, you just wouldn't get it.  Buy yourself a copy of ID4 and watch it with all the lights on.This is a remarkable piece of filmmaking by one of Hollywood's truly talented emerging directors.  Congratulations on some very good work.  You too, everyone in the cast.  Your performances deserve recognition.",Signs

Really, I think you can tell by the general public's rating (over 8 so far) that most everyone agreed with me.  This movie was great!  It was intense and scary, but also had quite a few humorous moments.  I even had my eyes tear up a bit in one part, so what more could you ask for! As I scanned through some of the comments written by other viewers, I noticed alot of criticism of the movie. I quit reading after just a few and decided to write my own, since I represent the majority of viewers who loved it.  It was a great story- it went way beyond being just a little spooky story about aliens and crop circles.  It had great dialogue and lots of little ""signs"" throughout the movie that all added up in the end, leaving you with that ""Wow"" feeling.  Of course the acting was great- look at who is in it!

He's becoming Alfred Hitchcock - but of the 21st century.Mel Gibson does one thing that most actors do not have the ability of... he becomes the character in the movie.  For once it's fun to actually see an actor just fall into his part so you can just enjoy the movie and not worry about cheesy cliches.  Luckily, none of those exist in this movie.  The director definitely does deserve recognition for his part on making the movie since everything just seems natural, not fake acting, just stuff that you'd say ""now that's how I'd do it.""Now for beyond the acting.  I can honestly say that no movie this year will deserve Best Sound, other than Signs.  And I really do like movies that use original sounds, rather than some sounds that make you go ""that's a cartoon sound!"".  Nonetheless, the script deserves recognition, the cinematography just hungers for an award and the music just begs for it.

924,Denogginnator,2/3 of the movie is worthless,2,24 July 2007,"This movie has it's charm, and certainly has some suspenseful moments. However, without giving anything away, it falls very short in the reality department. I accept that with Sci-Fi movies set way in the future, but this movie tries to make certain things seem plausible, yet no one would deal with the situation like the main characters would. Upon reflection some reviewers say they saw these flaws, but I'm surprised more didn't see them while watching how absurd the scenario's were. I'll try to give two examples without giving away too much info. At one point the family headed by Mel Gibson determines that the Aliens are going to be hostile. They correctly deduce that based on their location, they will be subject to that hostility, yet decide to stay. Secondly, when the danger is immanent, instead of preparing to defend themselves, Gibson starts relaying stories to his kids about their births. This movie is strong in the beginning, but loses most of it's credibility towards the time you should really be enjoying it. The end is also very weak, but I can't explain it without giving too much away. If you like Mel Gibson, and go in with low expectations, you might enjoy some of this film.

925,Northevenstar84,Pure Genius,9,27 May 2009,"When this film came out I was stunned by the negative reviews it received. I thought people would have had enough time to figure it out. M. Night Shyamalan's films are never entirely about the ""scare factor."" There's always another layer, another discussion taking place. This movie is about a man who's lost his faith. It's not about an alien invasion at all. The invasion provides an interesting background, an extraordinary environment of stress and fear that drives the characters. The title Signs is a dual reference to the crop circle and the divine markers that lead Graham back to his faith, allowing him to save his family. The other thing that was overlooked was Shyamalan's superb sense of art. Everything has been carefully crafted, every shot perfectly framed for his purposes. He knows how to manipulate an audience through his choice of camera angles and editing patterns. After all, what's most frightening is what you can't see. What sells the danger is the position and movement of the camera, the sequence of shots, the sound, and the actors' reactions. The other amazing thing is the film's sense of extreme isolation. Almost the entire film takes place at the farm, which places a lot of responsibility on both the actors and the director to keep things fresh and innovative. This film is so underrated, but it does require the patience to think about what you're watching. Pay attention and you'll enjoy it too!",Signs
926,MrVanilla,Just not that impressed,4,12 August 2002,"This was a decent movie.  There was a feeling about the movie, though, that there is probably some technical term for.  Frequently during the movie there was a pause,or pose, as if everybody was saying ""make sure you see how well this is photographed"", or ""make sure you see the symbolism here"". There was a zombie-ish slow motion quality to the acting that I could just never get.  What was that with guys watching TV with their hands on their knees?
I'm generally impressed with child actors.  Not this time.  Gibson & Phoenix both seemed to be handicapped by direction that must have included a lot of ""slow down, do less"".  In fact, the best performance in the movie was probably turned in by Shyamalan himself.  Maybe he should back off on directing, and stick to acting.I'll get over it.

Shyamalan is really bombing here.  He was reaching on Unbreakable, though I can understand some of the intrigue there.  I was still disappointed in Unbreakable after seeing his first major film success, The Sixth Sense, and in looking back I can see that he seems to be trying to be the next Spielberg in the age when Stephen was stuck on children's stories and fantasy movies.  But Signs is really not all that good. Okay, it's got some okay acting, some nice photography, decent editing, reasonable sound work, but sheesh, it isn't all that.  It moves relatively slowly, even for a 98 minute film, it fails to build all that much suspense, until the end, when some of the shots are quasi-unique, but it's just too family like for this type of really suspenseful subject matter and I was quite disappointed after seeing two sources, including all the people at imdb.com recommend it so highly.  It's not that great a movie people.  I once held M. Night in high regard, but now I plan on staying away from any future projects he might undertake.  Sorry, M.

928,Dribbleglass,What the?,3,30 January 2007,"I have to give Shayalaman credit as a true artist. His movies are always beautiful to look at, and it is clear he has artistic vision. In the case of ""The Sixth Sense"" he made perhaps the finest movie of its type I've ever seen. His consequent outings, however, have been sporadic at best. ""Unbreakable"" just didn't do it for me; maybe that just comes from a personal feeling that the whole super-hero thing is idiotic. And I'm not the sharpest guy around, but I had the plot twist in ""The Village"" figured out in the first few minutes. And ""Lady in the Water"" is a contemptible waste of time, money and talent.Which brings us to ""Signs"". This movie does deliver some eerie moments. It shows how effective suggestion and quick glimpses can be in these days of scriptless CGI blockbusters. There are some fine moments here and there, and Mel Gibson who has since proved to certifiably insane or laughing all the way to the bank, or both, turns in a good mournful performance. Joaquin Phoenix is likable as usual. I couldn't dislike the movie based on its actors, but I did dislike it.After successfully building tension, the director squanders it with silliness. Tin-foil hats and aliens who look less frightening than the Sleestacks from ""Land of the Lost"". And you can kill them with water? Who's bright idea was it to invade a planet with four-fifths ocean surface if water can kill you? I think the human race is in pretty good shape if we're invaded by Shayalaman's E.T.s, who can apparently cross the gulfs of interstellar space, but can't force their way into a locked basement, or land without making giant obtrusive patterns in cornfields. And a well-placed urine stream will dispatch them! Not like the guys in Spielberg's superior ""War of the Worlds"" remake. Those guys did some serious killing. Shayalaman's alien invaders gawk through kitchen windows into camcorders and hide in kitchen cabinets and stick their appendages out under the doors. Hey Mister Spaceman? You ever heard of the knife? Maybe the director was trying to make some statement that through their very alien-ness, the invaders were unaware of things we who are more accustomed to this environment know intuitively, but I'm not buying it. The humanoid shape, like an iguana in underoos, their apparent lack of any sort of battle plan, and their general ineptness do a lot to undercut their menace. I managed not to laugh out loud, but it took some effort. Lets hope this talented director turns out some better fare. He's certainly capable of it. But then so was Ed Wood.",Signs

933,traceyames17,War Of The Worlds plot revisited but using a family as they would fare in a hyperthetical situation.,10,20 August 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Identical plot to War of the Worlds in that the aliens arrive without unannounced and without warning. At first people don't suspect an alien invasion. The next phase their presence is seen when many spaceships, worldwide, are seen everywhere. The third phase tells of people getting killed by the aliens and finally, the aliens being defeated and the earth is safe again. In both movies, very limited detail of the alien form is given, reconnaissance aliens are seen searching through houses, being killed, the goodies all live and the world is saved again. That said, the main difference is the use of a family situation and how they deal personally with the invasion on their own farm. There are poignant scenes,  ones showing empathy with some humor and suspense also added to make the film really worth watching.The story starts with a widower, his brother and the widower's two children playing on a corn farm in Philadelphia. The next morning he goes into his corn field to discover strange sightings as his crop is crushed in the shape of some strange key.  Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) soon discovers on television that similar sightings are occurring elsewhere around the earth. Hess was once a reverend who lost faith after his wife was killed in an automobile accident. The following night, strange noises could be heard outside and a human like shape was seen by Hess and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Still not expecting aliens, they thought it was just practical jokers. The children go to the library and read up on aliens as television broadcasts now report that the aliens are seen hovering in the sky above many countries and cities. One of Graham Hess's acquaintances was first blamed for the trouble on the farm, but a subsequent visit to his place saw him fleeing for his life. His last words were ""There is one of them locked in the pantry."" Gibson's search of the house was both dramatic and also filled with laughter. The alien somehow got two fingers severed in an accident there. That is all we saw of the alien at that stage. Meanwhile around the world, there were reports of many deaths by poisoning. The aliens could somehow excrete a poisonous vapour, thus killing any humans in their way. The next and final night saw the family barricade themselves in their house, expecting the worst. Just after they thought they were safe, the aliens entered through the roof, giving the Hess's just enough time to barricade themselves in the underground basement. The acting during this tense and dramatic night was of a high quality and well worth seeing. The morning saw things very quiet and when the son Morgan (Rory Culkin) has a real bad asthma attack, Gibson has no alternative but to venture upstairs again. On turning on the television, we soon learn that the aliens were defeated and those remaining fled in haste. On turning around, we see the alien from previous, with two fingers missing, holding Morgan. The alien can be seen directing a stream of poisonous gas onto Morgan's face. Merrill, as we learnt earlier, was a champion baseball player who once hit a record distance of 504 feet. Without spoiling the end, we can see he was such a powerful hitter and also the fate of Morgan who was gassed.In all, a movie I could watch over and over. Unlike the wooden actors in War Of The Worlds, The acting here was first class. You could easily put yourself in the Hess's shoes and be part of the story. What would you have done in similar circumstances?",Signs
934,alan_dana,"Despite logical flaws, it worked for me",9,12 January 2003,"I'm a skeptic at heart & this movie did not appeal to me on the level of believing in UFOs or mystical origins of crop circles.  As pointed out by many, there are several plot holes/logical flaws in the pseudo sci-fi aspects of the movie. I agree it is ridiculous that the aliens cannot break through a piece of wood.Despite all of this, I found the movie very enjoyable.  I think one reason is that I never watch movie trailers or even TV advertisements - as I find they give away very critical elements of movies. So I went into the theater ""cold"" with noexpectations of it being a sci-fi blockbuster or the scariest movie of the year. Heck, I had no idea there would be aliens in it, or if it was supposed to be scary.So many of the negative reviews posted here are from people who thought itwas another ""Aliens"".  People who were oversold on its special effects or that it was extremely scary.  Who seemed to be looking for something that ""Signs"" isnot.Things I liked about the movie include:  1) The affection within the Hess family. 2) Gibson's performance - and I'm not a huge Mel Gibson fan.  3) The men'sdrive to protect the children.  4) The occasional sprinkles of humor.  5) The baseball element to the plot (I'm a baseball fan).  6) The philosophic angles, which if not of graduate school level, at least added a thinking element to the movie.I first saw it alone, but later took my wife and two children to see it.

But no one said anything about a Terminator who can travel through time and not pick out the right Sarah Conner. His plan was to travel through time, then use a phone book? Or when we used a Apple computer to defeat the Aliens in Independence day. Point is, in all movies, even very famous and successful ones, there are scenarios that don't really work. If you go into this movie and put your mind on vacation, like we do time and time again, you will enjoy it.

937,deanrl1,Poorly written and goes nowhere,1,6 August 2002,"This movie was another movie about a religious man who lost his faith because of something that happened to his family. The tragedy is slowly and excruciatingly revealed, even though it was easy to guess. Writers who dont know anything about sports should not try to include them in their movies. Homerun records are not measured in distance, there arent five homerun records to be set in a season. The way this was revealed was unbelievable by some guy in the army office that we never see again but seems to hate joaquin phoenix because he struck out a lot. They hit you over the head with the metaphor of striking out being related to his life as a loser, mentioning it a few more times in case you dont get it at first. Mel Gibson is an ex-religious man who they call father and dresses like a priest, yet he is married with kids, I guess the writer didn't research religion either. The aliens are such a small part of this brutal story that they aren't worth mentioning, except the way they are defeated is very easy. Although CNN couldn't figure it out even after they had been defeated all over the world. If this were written by anyone other than the writer of the Sixth Sense it would be dismissed as a hackneyed thrown together redone story.",Signs

This movie is so bad it goes past funny and just consistently sucks. The story is so stupid that they dont even try and they just get hokey and sappy and hope that moves you. My 7 year old niece could write a story about aliens that try too take over earth but are defeated by WATER, but she is already too smart to see that would make a terrible movie even if you got the actors too talk real slow and stare at stuff. There needs to be a rule made in the movies. If you are going to involve sports in your movie you need to have seen that sport played or have some concept of that sport. Shymalyan uses baseball as a metaphor for life, yet it is very clear he has never seen a baseball game or been told what happens in one. FYI  M Knight homerun records are not based on distance.

I do feel dirty after watching this movie though, so I have to say a few unflattering words about it, and its creator. It is now clear to me that the author of this piece, whom I can not, in good conscience, call by name here, is the biggest fraud and hack in the movie industry EVER. Yes, both ""The sixth sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" stunk, and this is even worse.The philosophical concept (the pitiful ""You see, in this world there are two kinds of people, my friend"" speech), that supposedly is the *actual* theme of the movie, is as shallow as it is flawed (or should I say, ""as clumsy as it is stupid...""?). The movie make it sound like all skeptics (i.e. the people who concluded that the Earth is actually round), or ""HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS TYPE B"" as we are branded here, are altogether nihilistic, immoral, devoid of creativity and imagination, unable to find a purpose in life, and most insulting of all, THE ONES WHO ARE AFRAID OF LIFE? Did it not occur to The Unnamable that it is precisely because of the so-called ""fear of loneliness"" that people have invented gods, miracles and providence in the first place?It's actually trash like this that makes me consider religion, just so I can believe there is a ""place of constant summer"" (by his own logic, The Unnamable is destined to go there, as he created this landfill guided by the divine, rather than by his own free will) for people who constantly insult my intelligence, and will sink to any level of self-degradation just to force their idiotic ideas upon the world.""The only thing worse than being talked about, is not being talked about"" indeed.Even Mel Gibson, who plays the loving father and ""Soldier of Jesus, America and Democracy"", in movie-after-abysmal-movie, seems to cringe when forced to deliver that ""key scene"" (at gun point? I can picture The Unnamable standing just out of camera shot with a gun in his hand, waving at poor Mel: ""This is my masterpiece! Say it! Say it!""). Other than that, he sleepwalks through the whole thing - even more so than Bruce Willis, in all his dramatic range, in those aforementioned movies.Nobody else seemed to have a consistent personality either. The kids alternated between creepy, cute, lecturing, and indulging in their gimmicks (as opposed to personalities). Joaquin Phoenix' character was superfluous to begin with, he seemed to have been added for the ""baseball"" scene alone, and looked like a child molester the rest of the movie.And of course there's a dog thrown in there for added melodrama, which I guess makes sense, because this guy is like the Dean R. Koontz of movie making.Insulting, shallow, boring. Flush it.",Signs
940,balbs,Truly awful,1,28 December 2005,"Twilight Zone would have done this better without all the pretentiousness and for a lot less dollars...regardless of the plot holes (what movie doesn't have those?) - the real issue is the turgid nature of the film, designed presumably with some sort of artistic 'intent' but actually creating a flaccid, boring piece of celluloid with a soggy sentimental backstop of lost faith. However truly sincere the director was with the creation the end result lacks impact, pace, logic, plot or believability.

943,gregorywyatt,6 out of 10,6,20 September 2002,"Sixth Sense brought an original spin to the Ghost genre.  Unbreakable brought an original spin to the Superhero genre.  Clearly M. Night Shyamalan likes to bring original spins to his films, since, with his third major feature, he tries to bring an original spin to the Alien Invasion genre.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest, who has lost his faith in God and himself.  Following the pointless death of his wife, Hess throws in the collar and struggles to raise his children with the help of his brother, failed baseballer Merill (Joaquin Phoenix).  When crop circles inexplicably appear at his farm, Hess blames local pranksters.  But, as local and world-wide news begin to reveal, these signs may come from an otherworldly source whose intentions are decidedly ambiguous.Shyamalan once again demonstrates where both his strengths and weaknesses are.  The acting is uniformly terrific, and Shyamalan coaxes exceptionally naturalistic performances from both Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, as Graham's children.  Shyamalan, himself, is effective in a scene that reveals the truth behind Graham's loss of faith.Long scenes and slow, lingering shots crank the tension up to maximum for most of the film.  This tension is utterly deflated, however, by a couple of lengthy flashbacks that interrupt the grand finale.  Shyamalan has a tendency to undo a lot of his good work by over-explaining the clues (or signs, if you prefer) that are laid before us.  It's a shame that he falls back on this again, because, unlike his previous two films, there is no real twist for us to figure out.Stylistically, Signs is very similar to both Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, and many of the characters feel overly familiar.  Indeed Mel Gibson is directly interchangable with Bruce Willis, as a morbid hero who denies the truth behind his identity.  The mood and lighting also make Signs feel derivative of Shyamalan's other efforts.  However, it's a credit to the quality of this style that it still works to such an extent.  The distinctly personal view of a world under invasion makes you feel more for the characters than should be possible given the hokey subject matter, and will linger in your mind longer than most films this summer.",Signs
944,alexander3000,the arrivals have come but are they friendly ?,9,31 August 2002,I really liked the movie because when you think of it it was not like the others movies about aliens. by this i mean that often those movies spend most of the times by trying to do these things when you really get a close look at the aliens etc. I really liked when the director created such a great movie by just having so few actors and have most of the scenes taken in the house.,Signs

I sat through this movie and laughed a few times, but the movie was so anti-climactic, that is was a huge disappointment. I really did expect better from this movie, but it was not what it was portrayed as, and that is a SciFi movie about Aliens and crop circles.I watched it with my 10 year old daughter, it was enough to get her heart beating fast, but not mine. My humor had worn out, and so had the movie. Do yourselves a favor, and watch it when it comes to video or pay per view.*****DEFINITE SPOILER*****
There is this part where Gibson is in the house of the man who accidentally killed his wife. An alien is trapped in the pantry closet. Gibson uses a large shiney kitchen knife to look under the door, but the alien grabs his hand, and so Gibson chops off a few of the alien's fingers...that was about the coolest part of the movie...other than that, I give the movie a 6, but it more deserved a 4.",Signs
946,iowane,I'd looked forward to this film,1,8 August 2002,"Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed ""Sixth Sense"" and had high hopes for M. as a filmmaker. I also loved ""The Fast Runner"" so I obviously have no problem with slow-paced films. I thought Spielberg's ""Close Encounters"" was some of his best work, so there should be no doubt that I have no problem with the theme of alien abduction/invasion. And, yes, I generally enjoy Mel Gibson. Though I don't think he is necessarily a great actor, he definitely has enjoyable screen presence and I've seen him nail some scenes (Danny Glover seemed to bring out the best in him).That said, let me also say, ""M. what were you thinking?"" Actually, I think I know what you were thinking. You were thinking, ""Everybody loves me and tells me I'm the next Spielberg, so it must be true."" Ego, my boy, is the surest way I know to create bad film...and this was (in my opinion, mind you) truly bad film. And no, you can't really hide the fact that you have your ego rather heavily invested in everyone else thinking you are the next Spielberg when you use the LARGEST TYPEFACE in all of your credits for the one immediately following the fade out that read, AN M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN FILM...just in case we had forgotten. There is also that matter of placing yourself in front of the camera as the veterinarian who had killed the wife, showing us all how well you can emote...which ain't so much. Keeping your head down and looking remorseful does not constitute acting.Honestly, M., were you making a sly spoof of the genre or were you just incompetently ripping off the films that influenced you? Did you think it was clever to only show the alien in soft focus? Can you really imagine that a family that has locked itself in the basement away from a bunch of hostile aliens would simply turn off their flashlights and go to sleep? Do you think anyone would be able to sleep if they thought the end of the world was at hand?! One more...and be honest about this...did you really just make this movie to sucker us all into the theatre on the pretext of seeing a fun, scary film only to pull the old bait-and-switch routine with your particular religious hysteria? I suspect you've been reading a bit of Deepak Chopra, judging by the sudden introduction of the synchronicity theme at the end (Mel Gibson chanting, ""There are no coincidences, there are no coincidences""). What did that have to do with anything? I can think of no explanation than that you had in mind the whole time to razzle-dazzle us with alien-created crop circles (which you, inexplicably, decided to rename crop ""signs"") only to sucker punch us with a simplistic and bland pseudo-spirituality at the end. The whole thing reminded me of a Scientology pitch.Wait a minute...is M a Scientologist? That could explain a lot. For example, it could explain why he threw in the crackpot writer on aliens who is really the one who knows what is going on. Come to think of it, there is even a bit of naming pattern evident here: L. Ron Hubbard / M. Night Shyamalan. Hmmm... Though really, did we need a kid reading a book to tell us that if the aliens are hostile there are one of two possible outcomes--they win or we win? That's usually the case in those situations. Even ""Independence Day"" paid the courtesy to our collective intelligence to assume that we would figure that out for ourselves. Just because Mel Gibson's character had lost his faith doesn't mean he had turned into an imbecile, too. Worse, you seem to think your audience is stupid. Well, I was stupid enough to pay to see the movie...but I won't be stupid enough to see another picture that includes the overblown (literally and figuratively) title: AN M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN FILM.

Everyone is going into this movie thinking it is some kind of chilling horror, or blood-and-gore slasher flick. Shyamalan doesn't do those tired genres, thankfully. Instead, he gives us a warm, funny, emotionally-charged, and yes, suspenseful thriller which manages to compact an entire list of genres into one whole film.I have seen the movie twice already- the first time for myself, and the second time just for crowd reactions. I wasn't bored through either showing. This is in part to some great acting by Phoenix, and some PHENOMENAL acting by the two child leads! Gibson isn't too bad either, but I have to admit, his part could have been played by anyone (sorry Mel :)I think for the first time Shyamalan really brings us a film that doesn't rely on smoke and mirrors to please the audience.

949,bondjames,FANTASTIC TWIST!,10,17 January 2003,"This is a fantastic film that gets better the more times you watch it. There are some major misnomers that this movie is about Christianity or Christian faith.  This is quite wrong.***WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD***This movie is about one mans philosophy on life and how seemingly unconnected events can influence a persons perspective.  Either you believe events are unconnected and don't see the ""signs"" or you believe there is a reason for everything.  Making this connection (and choice) is what the movie is all about.  Too many people mistake this film for Religious ""propaganda"" or are expecting too much about alien invasion.  The aliens are the threat (not the story) that makes one man rethink his philosophy on life.  In essence, he turns from ""the glass is half empty"" to ""the glass is half full"" by realizing the events in his life may have a greater purpose than what they appear on the surface.  It has nothing to do with Religious propaganda.  The fact that Mel Gibson's character was a priest that lost his faith was only a convenient way to package the idea.  It made the ""signs"" more significant and subsequently had a greater impact on the audience. The guy could have simply been a farmer, janitor, or bus boy, but adding that extra dimension of being a priest to his character made the realization of his philosophy more dramatic upon the films close.This is a fantastic film that has been subject to some rather harsh criticism by those who see it in more shallow terms.  It is not a movie about aliens.  It is not a movie about religion.  It is not a movie about faith.  It is a movie about a man who begins to see the positive side to all the negative aspects in his life.  This realization helps him triumph and overcome his fears.  I would highly recommend this movie for those who enjoy depth of character and story.  It is not intended to be ""difficult"" to figure out.  It is only intended to make you think.  I give it an 8 1/2 out of 10 stars.",Signs

952,ProfRevDrFilmReligionHistory,Shyamalan Getting' All Romans 8:28 with It,7,20 April 2017,"You think crop circles are a hoax? M. Night Shyamalan's film tries to have you thinking differently. And not just about crop circles.Rev. Graham Hess, is a widower living in a farmhouse along with his two children, Morgan and Bo. Graham's younger brother, Merrill, has also joined the household. Wait. Did I say REVEREND Graham Hess? Make that FORMER reverend since, as a result of his struggle to make sense of his wife's death, Mr. Hess has lost his faith.His wife's dying words were ""Tell Merrill to swing away..."" The randomness of those words sends Graham into a nihilistic tailspin, causing him to say things like, ""I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer"" and ""there is no One looking out for us...we are all alone.""But it is the seemingly random words and happenstances of the film that congeal in the end to produce an epiphany of sorts. In this regard, Hess's epiphany is not too different from the one experienced by Jules in Tarentino's PULP FICTION. If PULP FICTION had a big idea, it was that even the least worthy can catch a break from the Man Upstairs. Similarly, Shyamalan's big idea here is that even when aliens with bad intent show up on earth, God still cares, God is still in charge. It's just not so obvious. Until it is.In this way, ""Signs"" may just be a 105-minute, suspense-filled meditation on the Scripture that goes, ""We know that all things work together for good for those who love God..."" (Romans 8:28). And maybe even for the good of those who don't.This film has its definite strengths. There are some genuinely eerie moments midst the cornstalks (naturally). The ""Field of Dreams""-like setting and cinematography are easy on the eyes, effectively contrasting with the shadowy alien invasion. As for the cast, Abigail Breslin (as Bo), barely six years old and in her first film, does a great job being unself-consciously precocious. And there's barely a hint of Mad Max in Mel Gibson's Graham Hess. Furthermore, I tend to like anything Joaquin Phoenix does, including the weird Hip-Hop-ZZ-Top thing he did a few years ago. The weak link is the older brother (played by the younger brother of the kid who played the kid in the Home Alone films).Cinematically speaking, it is clear that Shyamalan has learned much from his movie-making idol, Alfred Hitchcock. On the other hand, unlike Hitchcock, Shyamalan is not content with a fleeting cameo. Instead, he cast himself in the role of a major minor character and the low quality of this performance is distracting. So, yeah, another weak link.Yet another complaint: the aliens come off as pretty wimpy. How is it that a humanoid species can figure out how to travel from one solar system to another but can't figure out a defense against one of the most basic of elements? C'mon now. Really, the best thing about this film is the theological question: Does a caring God exist or not? Shyamalan keeps this theological tension taut throughout the film and resolves it in a manner that you probably did not see coming.UPSHOT: despite its flaws, ""Signs"" manages to be a worthy film that can promote an even more worthy conversation about fate and faith, God and grace.",Signs

960,ILoveFilm1998,"""Signs"" Movie Review",9,5 August 2014,"""Signs"" is a 2002 American science fiction thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The story focuses on a former Episcopal priest named Graham Hess who discovers a series of crop circles in his cornfield. Hess slowly becomes convinced that the phenomena are a result of extraterrestrial life. It stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.I was eager to return to ""Signs"" after seeing the film a good number of years back. One, because I remember liking the film for being a well made thriller with a great sense of dread. And two, because of how the film has divided people in recent years, mostly due to the film's logic at the ending. Form where I stand, ""Signs"" is a masterfully told thriller, that contain real human emotions that makes the film both terrifying, and heartfelt.First off, I love how the story is told from this family point of view. It makes ""Signs"" feel realistic, and let us see the events taking place as they are seeing it. Also making the film seem real is the buildup. Instead on using it big guns at the beginning and ruin the suspense, it shows us information slowly, and grows the sense of dread in a chilling manner. The film lack of CGI unless needed is highly appreciated. Shyamalan's direction makes the story feel small scale, which works with the events that takes place, and wonderfully maximizes the tension throughout the film. To avoid repetition in my points, ""Signs"" less is more approach makes the film feel fresh, and not overly relied on cheap scares. Instead, the film builds it scares through the details given, and greatly done buildup. Simply put, I'm going to have trouble sleeping tonight, and I have to applaud the movie for being to able to do that.The family themselves I found very engaging. They are going through a major conflict that is easy to relate to, and care for. I was interested to see how bad things would go for them in this rather chaotic situation. Plus they seem like real people, as while for most of the film they are completely terrified, they add a few funny lines to lighten the situation. ""Signs"" is not a comedy, but a nice dose of humor gives the film levity to make it feel more human. The performances are great, with Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix especially giving subtle, but emotionally powerful performances, that again, make the characters feel human.And that word is likely, among with the scares, is what I think is the best part of ""Signs"", form the storytelling, to the characters, and from how the film is told from a visual point of view, it all feels human, and heartfelt. It a story about faith, losing it, and regaining it. Truth to be told, I had tears. Not man-tears, just tears of joy and happiness. For a director that has not been on the top of his game of as of late, M. Night Shyamalan had a great love, and even still, for the work he does. Even with his recent films, I feel that at the very least, that he is still trying. In my opinion, I feel he should stick to making films that are on a smaller scale, as he seems more comfortable working with films that are on a small budget. If I have any complain about ""Signs"", it's that even though the films' themes of coincidence and faith are effectively handled overall, I felt at a few points that seem to go a little bit too beyond than where they should have stay.As for the lack of logic with the ending, I have to say that this is a story told from one's family perspective. and ""Signs"" is going for a less is more approach. It not aliens going to Earth, but how one family handles that aliens arriving to Earth. If you want a more in depth look at ""Signs"", watch YouTube movie reviewer, Chris Stuckmann fantastic analysis on the film. What I would have say, he says that in a much more detailed and organized fashion better than what I could hope to do.Link to Chris Stuckmann video on ""Signs"" www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ju05PuiyQ",Signs
961,lonefoxandcub,The twist is... you've been suckered once again,1,23 May 2006,"How does this film merit a 7 rating?M Night Shyamalan seems to have carved an unspectacular niche in his own little 'tales of the unexpected' series. Everything about this film seems to have been done as an afterthought. No, it's not scary. No, it contains no real action to speak of. No, it's characters are not developed beyond a contrived subplot (or rather, only plot) of a preacher losing faith. Shyamalan seems to try so hard to present the amazing in an unamazing manner, that the result is... just dull (The Village is a prime example of his 'technique').As for the infamous water storyline, I don't want to hear about it being a metaphor, or it's the germs or whatever other excuse you can dream up to justify bad storytelling. These are the facts:Aliens vastly superior to us invade Earth, but are allergic to water. EARTH. A planet that is something like 70% water, populated by humans (also largely made up from water) who cry water when upset (a handy defence against these invaders eh?). Oh, and it has been known to rain here from time to time.There's a hell of a lot more pollution in the air than in our water, but hey. Don't tell the scriptwriter. He's trying to be clever.",Signs
962,Regalian_Captain,Who's that man standing in the corner with a violin?,3,9 November 2004,"This movie was a major disappointment, even coming for Mel Gibson. I was really looking forward to Shamylan's new movie but it just stunk. The thrills were cheap and the ending was, me'h. And does a violin playing in the background sharply gets rather annoying after the tenth time And the plot had so many holes I could bury myself in them. The aliens traveled billions of miles to conqueor earth and launch this massive invasion, and to what get stuck in a closet? And they can't even call for help. I would like to have given this movie a 2 but there are some funny parts in it that redeem a few of the actors. So for now I'll just watch Unbreakable and the Sixth Sense again and pray his next movie with be better. Other than that dump it.",Signs
963,strikerman,A masterpiece in excitement and mystery,9,21 April 2007,"I have seen this movie for the second time and it's worth seeing. It is a masterpiece in excitement, probably in this point the best film ever made. The explanation for Crop circles that way, in a family of a priest, working as a farmer now and living in an indigenous milieu makes the movie special. A great compliment to director M. Night Shyamalan, who proved as a genius in getting the audience goose pimples. His special picture of the aliens as green creatures without a face and that you fully see them first in the end of the movie increases excitement as well as his working with silhouettes. I think this movie is more realistic than any other alien-movie because of the inconspicuous picturing them. The only negative think is, in my mind, that water hurts the friends from outer space, but okay you have to find a way how to eliminate them. Of course I have to add the wonderful acting of Mel Gibson and the children who showed a realistic picture of what people would do when aliens take over our planet. The last scene of the film when Morgan is remaining unharmed because of his asthma decease is also well-considered. On balance it is awesome to watch this movie and I would recommend it to everyone.",Signs

It looked so budget (partly due to the old projection TV) that I would have guessed it was made in the late 80's or early 90's.No redemption, no higher moral ground gained, Not plot twister. Endless time wasting footage. It try's to play on your fear to keep you going and count on you being a couch potato. It's main goal was to make money not entertain you. Gibson must have been like a 10000 gorilla getting a see-saw with the rest of the cast and crew and blasting over the moon... A thousand dollars for Mel, $1 for everyone and everything else.I'm Catholic like Gibson; the little bits of religion tossed in were a joke.

966,Colm22,->SIGN<- of a talented director! So clever...Eh?!,9,4 December 2005,"Signs does not have much originality in its plot, (aliens attempt to invade earth and wipe out the human race!) but what it does have is a director who is a master at creating moments of unbearable tension, with the comparisons to Spielberg being very much vindicated by this film. Shyamalam has taken a fresh spin on the alien invasion story by focusing the entire action with one family, ironically in a way that was imitated to an extent by Spielberg himself with ""War Of The Worlds"". The fact that the characters are given room to display a certain amount of depth and humour (particularly in the discussion early on between Graham, Merrill and Officer Paski) make them likable and empathetic which is key to the success of the tension in the set-pieces later in the film and that Shyamalam keeps the aliens hidden until the final act suggests he is a director who is clearly aware of what true film fans appreciate in modern cinematic storytelling and that does not necessarily involve a huge overdose of CGI. Admittedly the alien in the climatic scene does look a tad unconvincing but it is the testament to the films' overall strengths that this barley affects its impact. Strong performances from its two young actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, as well as the ever reliable Gibson and Phoenix on top form make this film an excellent piece of entertainment which arguably improves upon repeat viewings. Pity about ""The Village"" though Shyamalam!",Signs

968,PabloThePirate,The stupidest movie that I have ever seen,3,29 August 2018,"I'm going to talk about 2 moments in Signs that made me sigh (in my head, not out loud). The first one is when Graham tells his family that he heard ""a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water"" (NOTE: ""they"" refers to the aliens) and Morgan responds that said theory ""sounds made up."" This is stupid because Morgan gets most if not all of Morgan's information on aliens from a book that Morgan purchased whose veracity is, at the moment of Morgan saying that the theory that Graham heard ""sounds made up,"" dubious. At one point, Morgan wears a tinfoil hat so that the aliens can't read Morgan's mind, even though Morgan has no proof that the aliens can read Morgan's mind if Morgan's not wearing a tinfoil hat. Morgan's comment that the theory that Graham heard ""sounds made up"" is highly hypocritical. The second moment in Signs that made me sigh is in the climax, in which there's an alien. During part of the climax, the camera angle switches from third-person, where we can actually see the alien, to first-person, through the viewpoint of the alien. I don't know why the camera angle switched this way, but my guess is that the filmmakers stopped showing the alien so that the filmmakers didn't have to spend as much money on CGI. Come on, filmmakers, don't be lazy!I give Signs a 3.1/10.",Signs
969,joeslev,"Good, but not a classic.",7,31 December 2005,"""Signs"" is a film that intrigues the viewer, but the climax is somewhat of a letdown, and disappoints.The story concerns a series of unexplained crop circles appearing around the world, and fears of an alien invasion follow. However the focus is on one family, made up of good performances from Mel Gibson, as a former Reverend, and Joaquin Phoenix, as his younger brother. Mel Gibson is a widower with two children, and the significance of this family is revealed when they find a pattern in their crop field.As mentioned the acting is decent, and the story tight and contained. The film is somewhat of a slow burner with the tension and suspense slowly building up. The characterisation is effective, as each character is involved in the climax. We see how each character, as well as the other people reacts to the events of the film. Memorable scenes include a claustrophobic basement section, which is particularly effective and frightening.The film is not too dissimilar to Spielberg's recent ""War of the Worlds"", but where that is large scale, and often breathtaking at times, ""Signs"" is small and compact, which often works well, as it keeps the story focused, and personal.In conclusion- ""Signs"" is a good solid movie, but does not offer anything particularly memorable.",Signs

In fact, I think the director would have done better to have taken the film in that direction. This is one of the most peculiar, boring, and pretentious films I have seen in a long time.

I know some viewers didn't like the religious undertones, however, must I remind you that this is about a minister's family.  Now, I'm not all that religious myself, but I still enjoyed the film.  I like the way the director intricately tied everything together.  I do have to commend this cast and crew for going through with this film after what happened to our nation (filming was to begin Sept. 12).

First off, you take a fantastical story such as super heroes and alien invasion and you try to spin a human side to them.  It's repectable in theory, but both of these offerings failed to capture an interesting home life with it instead feeling shallow and prefab.  Then to make it more clever, just as the action is reaching its denouement, we switch in even closer so as to avoid showing the audience anything interesting.  The world is supposedly run amock with thousands of aliens and we get a standoff with one.  I don't need big flashy effects, but it honestly seems like a not so clever Ed Wood trick to save money.At least to me anyway, the first part of Unbreakable was better.  This one seemed much more excrutiating.  I was 30 minutes in going...gee I wonder if the daughter's problem with water is going to come to be something important later...

Father Hess breaks it down for us -- When 'bad things' happen, they scream at our flesh one of two options: God a) does not exist or b) must be malevolent.SIGNS tells us though God may seem aloof, apathetic or nonexistent, He is ever present and He cares.   SIGNS tells us that God is good and He is in control. SIGNS is a story about faith...about listening closely.
I thought Night used the aliens as a clever plot device to communicate an all important message to an otherwise deaf world.  Our world is very intrigued by 'aliens' and entertained by the possibility of their existence...and night used our interest to feed us simple truth.  And since Sept 11th, the whole world has been asking: Why do bad things happen to good people?  How can a good God exist in the face of such evil?

So I will add a line saying to READ NO FURTHER when details may give some stuff away.  You are safe until then.  This is an enjoyable movie.  Try not to analyse it too much.  If you spend a lot of time thinking about it afterwards then you will come up with some impossibilities that will bother you.  M Night Shyamalan always spends a lot of time building.  That isn't necessarily a flaw, (obviously since he is being called the next Spielberg), but I don't think building and building always works for action movies.  He did this in Unbreakable (which I really liked) but that movie really needed more movement and more action sequences to work better.In Signs, M Night spends a lot of time building Mel Gibsons character and showing the inner conflicts his family has suffered after a recent tragedy. Then he spends a lot of time building suspense in preparation for the climax.  That just might be too much building.  I read reviews and have heard DJs say this movie was so scary that people were screaming in the theatres and etc.  It never affected me that way.  I never felt ""scared"" one single time.  I don't think that was what M Night was going for.  There are plenty of tense filled scenes in the dark that keep you on the edge of your seat, but I didn't feel the suspense as well as I have in other movies however.  You have to go see this one if you're an M Night Shyamalan fan. If you aren't a fan of his, but are just looking for a cool movie to watch then toss a coin.  Every other person will like it and every other person may be slightly disappointed.----------------------------------------------------------DO NOT READ FURTHER UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE. DETAILS ARE INCLUDED HERE THAT WILL SPOIL IT FOR YOU!!----------------------------------------------------------OK.  I found a couple of flaws in the movie that really bother me.  First of all, Mel Gibson keeps important information about the weaknesses of the aliens from the world.  He could have saved millions of people if he had just made a phone call to the authorities telling them about the alien in the pantry.  It seems far fetched, but scientists could have taken him and performed tests on him and may have discovered their weakness in time to broadcast it all over the globe before communication black out.  And Mel was a PRIEST?  He is an ex-priest with no concern for anyone but himself.  What church was he ordained in?  The Church of the Selfish Mind?  Also I have a problem with a priest who blames God for the death of his wife.  A priest would not do this.  Priests know that death is a part of life and when one dies they go to Heaven.  At least according to the Catholic Church. So there is nothing to blame God for.  His wife is in a better place.  Also priests console grieving family members all of the time on a regular basis.  After assuming the role again at the end, he would have lost all credibility as a priest.  Who wants to be consoled by a priest who blamed God the first time he lost a loved one?  I wouldn't!  I wouldn't trust his advice at all.Also, explain to me again why the aliens can't use their superior technology to bust down a door?  Because we might use nuclear weapons?  A farmer doesn't have a nuke!  Even a child could pick up an axe and get through a door.  Not to mention a race of beings with the technology to travel between galaxies.  A box of nails and a hammer rendered this superior technology powerless.  I have a serious problem with that.  Are you ready for the BIG ONE?  Their weakness is water right?  Our planet is about 75% water.  Would you try to conquer a world that was 75% sulfuric acid?  Would you attack a race of beings whose physical bodies were 80% sulfuric acid and who could spit it out of their mouths?  And if you did attack them, then wouldn't you wear some kind of suit to protect yourself? These aliens are stupid yet they have mastered technology.  This is an impossible combination.  They are walking around naked and attacking people without protection or weapons when even the simplest reconnaisance would reveal that the acid that eats through their alien skin is found in abundance in every house in America.  We are composed of the element that kills them and they fight us hand-to-hand without any protection at all? 
I enjoyed the movie, but after thinking about it now I wish I hadn't seen it.  Its hard to believe that the same director wrote Sixth Sense which seemed to contain no major flaws at all.  This movie is just chock full of them.  Try again Shyamalan.  You can do much better buddy!",Signs
980,inmaniac,How can ANY intelligent person have enjoyed this MOVIE!?!?,6,16 August 2002,"I just have to add a second review.  I can't believe the rave reviews for what I think was a stupid movie.  How in the world could you like this movie?  ITS FULL OF FLAWS!  I could list them, but just click on my username and read my other review for the details.  Anyone, who reviews this movie and thinks its a great piece of work hasn't gone past a basic knee-jerk reaction.  ""What a cool looking Alien.  WOW! This is a great movie!""  And its not even that scarey.  Its not scary at all.  I was FAR more frightened in the Blair Witch Project than in this piece of garbage.  The movie gets worse and worse in my mind as I think about it.  It was extremely irresponsible for Shyamalan to make a movie without giving any thought at all to its credibility and believability. 
I am sorry to say this, but anyone who likes this movie isn't very intelligent or they don't watch very many movies and are overimpressed with some of the cheap thrills Shyamalan throws in there to ""WOW"" the crowd.  I have had more suspense watching the Fear Factor and I find the Animaniacs to be more believable than this total waste of film. Shyamalan has changed his film-making direction (with this movie) from ""Braveheart"" to ""Scream"".  His only goal now seems to be to shock people in quick-and-dirty scenes with little or no plot at all. If you liked this movie, then you are going to LOVE the Halloween series.

Does this imply that a raincoat is a more sophisticated invention than a spaceship? d) Aliens come to `harvest human beings', but can be scared off by wooden clubs. Aehhh . the human body consists 90+% of water, which the aliens cannot handle . does this qualify for the `real dumb plot award'??? e) A referent looses his faith when his wife dies (which is fair), but regains it when he remembers her last words which tip him off that Aliens doesn't like being beaten with wooden clubs . are there more people who think this is crap???Also:f) When confronted with an imminent Alien attack, board yourself into a lonely wooden house in the prairie - don't go into the next town, arm yourself and join the local militia / military organisation.g) Don't have the asthma medicine your son's life is depending on handy. h) After you boarded up your house, just hang around in the lounge. Don't fortify your cellar basement and shift all your water, food and medicine there. i) Lacking fire arms, don't arm yourself with knifes, axes or whatever you can find. Leave your vicious guard dogs (who detect aliens earlier than you and could scare them off) outside the house... And the top price goes to:j) Alien communication can best be observed on baby monitors!!! . sophisticated civil air control and military radar equipment cannot spot them.Well, they don't make movies like that one any more.

About two thirds of the way through, I found myself no longer expecting to jump out of my seat at the climax of any specific scene because most did not have a climax. Any tension that was built, just dissipated and fizzled out. With the exception of Mel Gibson's character, the acting was very good and believable. Mel's character, ""Father"", didn't seem real. At the very start he seemed overly suspicious, but totally unemotional, about the crop circle, but then didn't seem to react ""normally"" to the unexpected demise of a family pet. Most people would freak out whereas he took it all in his stride, with little or no emotion. This film was played using an old 50's method, where all the horror happens off camera, leaving you to your own imagination.

988,johnny_roastbeef002,A great film with an intelligent message.,10,11 January 2003,"The ""Sixth Sense"" is one of my favorite movies; I was totally blown away by it. This film gave me much of that same feeling. Anyone who has seen an M. Night Shyamalan film, knows that he always has a greater message within his films. He does not make movies about just ghosts or aliens, they always have a purpose. People accepted this in ""Sixth Sense,"" so why not this one? I believe it is because people were expecting a thriller/action movie or just did not understand the film. As I was leaving the theater the day that I seen it, I heard people saying, ""That was ok I guess,"" or ""That wasn't very good."" These were comments made in an unsure tone and I knew exactly why. Some people just did not pick up certain aspects of this film, they casted them off as unimportant. I have seen the widest range of comments, everything from the worst movie ever to brillant. Some critics got it right, but many did not, and that showed me a lot. If you do not care for this film, then have good reasons. Don't just say that there wasn't enough aliens or the message sucked. If you watch this message in the future, have an open mind and leave the world's sarcastic manner at the door.",Signs
989,commodorjim,an underachiever,4,5 January 2003,"I was disappointed.  This movie left me thinking one thing at the end.  How could an alien civilization travel from anywhere in space and be too dumb to be able to cope with the likes of a baseball bat an a glass of water.  Mel Gibson is believeable as the concerned dad and grieving husband, but with such a silly premiss, who cares.  There is much better sci-fi out there, old and new.",Signs

991,selwyn-5,Shyamalan has the touch,7,26 August 2003,"Shyamalan is master of orchestrating the buildup of tension and atmosphere. The fact that in the film aliens actually appear just four brief times is a testimony to deft and skilled direction.  The same is true of the 6th sense - all that tension and fear, and you only see dead people about four times in 2 hours.Gibson and Phoenix are an excellent casting choice - they complement each other very well and are thoroughly believable as brothers.  Phoenix has the haunted look down pat - just what the film needs.There's no need to recap the storyline - other reviews have done that already.  But it is necessary just to counter some of the criticisms that have come Signs' way. A lot of people out there were griping about the fact that the aliens were quite primitive  - having to use ground signs to navigate, and being vulnerable to water.  I think this is simplistic - why do people always assume that aliens, if they do exist, are more advanced than we are? Couldn't it be possible that humans are in fact the most advanced life form in the universe?Shyamalan makes his film more believable by not equipping his aliens with every gadget in the book - and at the end of the day its a film about ordinary people, who are emotionally stretched, reacting and coping with extraordinary events.",Signs

The underlying theme of losing and reawakening faith was an unusual gift for a film made in this day and age.  Mr. Gibson and Mr. Phoenix shine as two confused human beings, not sure how to face each day, let alone face the possibility of the end of the world.  I enjoyed every moment of the film and have already made plans to see it again before it leaves the theatre.  This is definitely going to be in my DVD collection.",Signs
993,ronkenator,Science fiction mingles with faith.,9,3 May 2007,"M Night Shyamalan's SIGNS is a movie ostensibly titled for the worldwide crop circles that have mysteriously begun increasing in frequency, but a stronger argument can be made that the title refers to the signs from God that people of faith see in every day occurrences that atheists might dismiss as coincidences. The lead character, Graham, an Episcopal priest portrayed by Mel Gibson, says as much during the film.In addition to finding one of these crop circles in their own field, Graham's faith has been shaken by a tragedy that he is trying to recover from, while raising his two young children with the help of his down on his luck brother, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix. The crop circles indeed portend something sinister, and the tension that builds as the family hunkers down and tries to survive is reminiscent of Hitchcock. We do not see the threat until the very end, and suspense is built with mundane dangers like asthma attacks, and sculpted by letting our imaginations fill the shadows and groans.There are many types of science fiction, and the science fiction that takes a background role to its characters always has greater appeal. Also, there are many movies that approach the question of faith; those that attempt to persuade one side aren't as successful as those films that simply try to present a test of faith. SIGNS manages to do both, although the payoff for the faith subplot far surpasses that of the science fiction plot. Very few films combine science fiction with faith. SIGNS is much more successful than the Jody Foster vehicle, CONTACT, and SIGNS manages to present the test of faith in a manner that is believable and eloquent. In a pivotal moment during the film, Graham must decide if he was given a sign from God, and act on it. Audience members of faith will see the sign, atheists will see coincidence. Shyamalan beautifully makes this moment ambiguous, as are all such signs in life.",Signs
994,JUGGERNAUT-1,"VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH ""SIGNS""!:",6,3 August 2002,"After all the hype, the waiting, the anticipation, etc,....this film simply DOES NOT deliver the goods. I'd give it a 6.9 on the high side as a more than complimentary gesture. My wife gave it a 1.0.The theater was packed and this movie will sucker a lot of people in for a few days (probably $40 mil+ weekend gross), but then the word-of-mouth will make it drop like a rock quickly thereafter. I saw NO ONE who seemed thrilled by the film at the end. No buzz. No chatter. No excitement. Walked kind of limply out of the theater. Most seemed, like me and my wife, to be disappointed and left kind of hanging a bit.Script is often slow, a bit dull and, at times, muddled up. Acting is ""OK"" to good....nothing spectacular. It delivers just a very few suspenseful moments (about 3 or 4 tops) that perhaps 8 people (mostly under 12) in the whole audience screamed at. This hype of it being a ""very scary"", ""edge of your seat"", ""jump out of your seat"" film is just not true except as I've said above. And the claim that M.N.S. is ""the next Spielberg"" is a TOTAL joke!!! M.N.S. has NOTHING in common with Spielberg AT ALL! If anything, M.N.S. is more like Rod Serling or Hitchcock in that he tries to deliver surprise elements (even if getting there is very slowly paced). Even in his best film, ""THE SIXTH SENSE"", the writing gets slow and dull during the first half or so...you know how M.N.S. is....but it paid off BIG TIME in the final resolution, as we all know. ""SIGNS"" has a LOT of the M.N.S. type of dullness and slowness throughout a lot of the film, but you TRUST that he WILL, in fact, lead the film down to another great resolve, etc,.....but it just does not deliver on that trust. And that will be enough to see this rating drop along with its gross. I predict it will end up with about a 6.5-7.0 rating at best and a domestic gross of about $140 mil-$160 mil with a total WW gross of about $250 mil-$275 mil.I wanted to like it...I'm a HUGE fan of ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" (I'd rate it a 10). I like M.N.S. and Mel Gibson a lot. By the way, ""SIGNS"" also seems to be somewhat of a ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" rip-off in a couple of regards as well as a rip-off of other films. To me, it was nothing more than a much better than average flick (most flicks REALLY suck these days!), but I expected a major blockbuster. If you plan on dropping $40-$70 to take your family to this thing, you WILL NOT get your money's worth. Take a smaller group to a matinee or wait for DVD (which I'm sure will add footage and alternate endings), I am VERY sorry to say.__JUGGERNAUT__",Signs
995,Jeffscr5,Shyamalan continues to thrill audiences,10,10 August 2002,"Signs had a difficult battle of meeting the high expectations that M. Night set for himself.  Sixth Sense provided that twisted ending that made audiences see it twice to check M. Night's consistency and Unbreakable is one of the few modern movies that not only tells an amazing story but uses many innovative film techniques to demonstrate a point.  But I believe that M. Night did not want to spell it out for us so cut and dry this time around, he relied a lot on the audience's perception of this movie.  M. Night did not wait for the very end to twist the plot like he in Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, but he used a more clandestine approach to make the audience think and send them back to see it right away at least two or three times to check their theories.SPOILERSM. Night has taken a child's candid and insightful approach to life as the key in all of his films.  It as if what he has been trying to tell all us is that children are the key to all of the life's mysteries.  Therefore, just as Haley Joel Osment had the key to the purgatory creatures and Wide Awake's Joseph Cross held the key to answering his own impossible question, little Bo Hess has the key to what actually went on in this movie.  Her first lines were strange but overshadowed by the horror of such a mammoth crop circle. Bo said to her father `You're in this dream too?' and her father, Graham (Mel), replied `This isn't a.' (Graham never finished the lie)  Bo comments about dreams two other times throughout the films duration.  M. Night also shows many night figures like metal moon wind figure blowing from a ledge of the barn and star cut outs of wood during the daylight to contrast with a dreamlike atmosphere.  These contrasting images portray a dream taking place that even though the dream takes place during daylight hours, night figures still exist, perhaps solely for symbolism.  Having the entire movie, except the very ending when Graham is shown becoming a father again, dismisses a lot of the distasteful comments said about the film.  Some did not like the abrupt Sci-fi turn the film took at the end, they prefer that M. Night tap into the tricks he used in Unbreakable and continue to only show a dark reflection of the alien or just its shadow and an occasional finger or two but not the entire alien.  But, dreamlike apparitions must be shown in their entirety unless the dreamer as a lack of imagination.  The movie did not show a cut a dry dream for one reason.  Think how upset audiences would be if M. Night panned from Graham's bedroom from the dream to him waking up. The audience would walk away feeling that they accomplished nothing by going to see the movie that just witnessed a man's dream that re-established his faith.  Therefore, it was imperative for M. Night to flash forward to the dream's outcome and put in the hand of the audience to decide what they just saw.M. Night keeps amazing me with his innovative style, twists, and plots. Movies about questioning faith are potent force in everyone's mind and M. Night tackled the task in the strangest but most perfect and thrilling way. I have become the biggest M. Might Shyamalan fan and I know want to be the first in line to all of his movies and I hope that one day I could meet or even get a chance to work with this brilliant filmmaker.  I gain something new every time I re-watch Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs.  IN a disappointing summer season of blockbuster movies, Signs stands alone as the must see of the summer and the must own when it comes out on tape just so you can enjoy this ingenious piece of filmmaking over and over.",Signs
996,Jeffscr5,To all those who are complaining you did not get it,10,14 August 2002,"Read this comment only if you have seen the movie and want a further understanding of its greatness:I feel so bad for M. Night if he is reading all of these comments downplaying the movie because the general audience just did not comprehend it.  Here is the big spoiler... the whole thing is a dream.  Notice the snow at the beginning and the end that was not a part of the major plot.  There were the day/night contrasts popping up everywhere- the moon metal ring hanging from the barn during the day and sun shining the stars in the boards on there way up form the cellar.  And the fact that little Bo Hess mentioned that it was a dream at least three times.  She says to Mel Gibson ""you are in this dream too?"" and Mel replies ""No, this isn't a...""  He was interrupted by the view of the large crop circle in the field that overshadowed this crucial comment and redirected the audience's attention just like they did the entire movie.I give a lot of credit to M. Night for keeping his mouth shut and hiding this hidden plot real well.  The twist that everyone says the story was missing came early and was reaffirmed by the snow at then end.  M. Night was not going to end the movie with Mel waking up, that would infuriate the audience.  Therefore, he showed the dreams outcome instead.  I apologize to Mr. Shyamalan for the audience not figuring out this brilliant piece of work, I do now expect after those less savvy IMDB users read this and fully understand the movie they will go back and see the movie in awe of this filmmaking genius and change their votes and their comments. I give Signs at 10/10 and look forward to M. Night's next masterpiece.",Signs

I don't think I've ever seen another movie with such overdramatic acting.For example, SFC Cunningham was nothing but a parody of a military guy in an old horror film. If this film was meant to be taken seriously, (and I think it was), then that character was just a horrible disruption of whatever mood the director was trying to set. That happened over and over.
So many acts by the characters didn't make any sense! Merrill went up from the basement to check the house, and even though there was an axe handy, he went up empty handed! Also, the aliens are smart enough to get here, but not smart enough to bring raincoats?

From that point on, it's just the watching and waiting for the big moment when he regains his faith.  And when it does eventually happen (come on, it's not like we believe Mel WON'T regain his faith), it's in a scene that's utter gibberish.  Don't get me wrong. There are some GREAT scenes in this movie--about five in all.  The rest is inconsistent (characters are capable of building spaceships to travel across the universe, they're strong enough to jump straight up onto the roof of a house, but can't get out of a locked pantry?) and s-l-o-w, presumably to let the suspense build.

Let's get that out of the way at first.  But it is a very mediocre movie, especially considering the rating it has on this ridiculous website.  Much like The Others, which was another supposedly creepy movie, there's really nothing scary in this movie.  You don't get to see what's scaring you -- some people have pointed this out -- and yet, well, yes, you do.  The movie's ""faith"" question that everyone seems concerned about is essentially trivial -- some people believe that weird things happen because of coincidences, others think that weird things are signs, and when Mel Gibson breaks down, crying out, ""his lungs were closed!"" you see Shyamalan's take on the question.  But it never really mattered whether Mel lost his faith in the first place, because Shyamalan is far from a gifted writer and Mel's character development was poor.  I cared more about why the little girl wouldn't drink her water (which we never found out) than why Mel's faith even mattered.  At no point in the movie did he really seem to have lost it, or did it matter whether he did or not.  (And speaking of the water, thanks, M. Night, for the ridiculous aping of Gremlins.)The problem is that Signs is a B-movie trying to masquerade as something deeper than that.  The plot is silly, but I found no evidence that Shyamalan was trying to pull a big joke.  I wondered out loud during the movie whether this was supposed to be a farce (having looted ideas from Gremlins, Close Encounters, Aliens, Evil Dead, even Blair Witch!) on the order of a Scary Movie, but it ended up taking itself too seriously.  The joke's on Shyamalan, and, I suppose, anyone who's actually scared by little green men, especially when the plot is so obvious from the get-go.
Shyamalan's movies keep getting worse.  Sixth Sense was pretty good. Unbreakable was intense and powerful, but ended up cluttered and confused. Signs is a sloppy mess.

1003,Inuendo,A mixed bag of two halves,6,4 April 2003,"Very rarely does a film have an equal amount of good and bad points. Usually I can say 'I liked that film' or 'I didnt like that film' in varying degrees.  With Signs I couldnt decide and ended up liking some and loathing others. **SPOILERS FOLLOW** On the good side first - The trailers led me to expect a film along the lines of a conspiracy theory with a is it/isnt it aliens plot throughout. Very early on though we establish that they are aliens and for me we got to see a more realistic version of Independence Day. I also liked the fact that we were treated to an opinion that there may actually be no such thing as God.  So rarely do us atheists get our say in films - even in Contact we were in the wrong! The direction was excellent once more.  I like a film that treats its viewers with enough intellegence so that if it doesnt show you something you can let your imagination work it out.  From reading the other reviews I can see that this doesnt always work as some people prefer to be shown every detail rather than use their imagination. Final good point - nice to see Mel Gibson not overacting for a change, if anything he underplayed it to produce one of his best roles ever but unfortunately not one of his best films. Bad points - Number one out of the blocks which follows from above is the fact that in the end the 'non believer' turns into a 'believer' once more and everything is right in the world.  Perhaps one day we can have a film without everything turning out right because of God.  I believe what Mel's character says in that we are alone and it is what we all do that makes a difference NOW because this is all we have. I found the soppy part with the wife a bit distracting that late in the film and her 'vision' of the future a bit convenient - I'm sure they could have found another way to work out that water kills aliens as sure as paper kills stone. Finally I didnt like it's pace.  It was slow for the most part but I cant knock that too much as it added a bit of suspense. I'm just glad I saw it on DVD and not at the cinema.

I'm sorry, but this totally blew this movie for me, and as I liked both The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I have just one piece of advice for Shyamalan, please stick to those type of films and for the sake of true Sci-Fi fans like myself, do not attempt any more Sci-Fi flicks, it's not your bag.",Signs
1007,apk2043,Not meant to be alien film. SPOILERS,10,11 September 2002,"For me this is my favorite movie in a very long while. First, I don't see this movie as another INDEPENDENCE DAY or another alien horror movie. I take the position that Shyamalan was trying to bring a story across about what faith is and what it means, and how one man regains his faith through an interesting circumstance. This film was billed as a ""crop circle"" film which I really loved because I went in thinking I would see another alien suspense movie but was pleasantly surprised to find one of the deepest plots to any movie, as well as one of the most original ideas. I would never have guessed that this movie would be a movie about faith with a majority of the plot set during an alien invasion. The minute amount of special effects used was also well done, because it didn't overwhelm the true story. I think lately many people go to movies just to see how good the effects are and not really caring about the plot (for example,STAR WARS:EPISODE1), well in this movie Shyamalan throws the plot in people's faces, and doesn't rely on special effcts to carry the movie. He also relies on the music and camera techniques to create a genuinely suspenseful thrilling experience (a la Hitchcock). The opening credits themselves were suspenseful with the music, even though they just showed names. Overall I would definitely give this movie a 5 out of 5. And probably the best movie of 2002.

No, this movie does not have the alien ships chasing after us as ID4 did, or the grand spectacle of contact that so many other alien movies have centered on, but you'll have to forgive it for being original. Instead, the movie centers on a single family and their reactions to a potential alien invasion.*** Possible spoilers ***It's like the Sixth Sense in that, if you think about what happened in the film in a greater context than those people who were in the film, it doesn't make much sense (I mean, it's great that he tricked the audience into believe he was alive, but do you think he could go that entire length of time - I believe it was eight months - without talking to anyone, or realizing something unusual?). All of his movies are a gimmick used to bring another aspect of human nature to light. But the gimmick isn't the pay-off. I mean, if you expect some great revelation into the nature of aliens, you're not going to get it. If you want some revelation into the nature of human spirit, then pay attention.I do have a few points, just interest stuff (and one critisism):I always find it interesting when a film portrays any ambiguous spiritual pay-off as pertaining to a particular belief system. In regards to this film, there's really nothing in the Christian faith that would support the concepts of fate and signs as promoted by this film. It could just as soon promote Hinduism, Islam or Judaism. But this is a trend I've seen a lot of recently. Simon Birch, for instance. Or even The Testament, one of the latest John Grisham novels. Both have ambiguous religious ideas which the characters translate into some broader religion, which implies other beliefs. But perhaps it's just the world's latest trend to promote this sort of ambiguous spirituality, that the underlying principles of religion are worth living by, but they manifest themselves in many ways. Perhaps we're supposed to become Ba'Hai. And make no mistake, I'm not criticizing the movie - I sort of like the idea - I just find this sort of thinking interesting.However, M. Night should promptly turn on the television and see how a *real* news report is structured. I laughed every time the television was turned on. I mean, we've all seen reporters reporting during crises, like 9/11, and they do not report like that. They do not get all huffy and puffy and try to incite the viewers with slow-paced lines about how terrified everyone is (especially with a trembling voice). They give the facts, usually with a straight face. That's what they trained to do. The reports here looked like they were being narrated by the guy who does the voice-overs for The Outer Limits.Matty J",Signs
1012,alan_taylor69,Absolutely fantastic!,10,1 October 2002,"Signs is the third film of M.Night Shyamalan's short Hollywood career. After critical and commercial success for 'The Sixth Sense', and unfair criticism of the vastly underrated 'Unbreakable', he has opted for a different slant on the theme of Alien invasion.  this is not an independence day no-brainer, but an intelligent, thought provoking and original movie. I think I'll struggle to name another film as good this year.The central story revolves around Graham Hess, a former minister who has lost his faith.  When mysterious crop circles appear beside his home, a life changing, and faith seeking journey begin.  To say much more about the story would spoil it, but suffice to say, it is mind-blowing, and thought provoking at the same time.The direction from Shyamalan is first class, and by a man who clearly knows how to provoke a reaction from the audience.  I can't think of another director in Hollywood today who can control the camera quite like he does. Comparisons with the great Alfred Hitchcock come to mind.Overall, this is one the very best films of all time.  A bold statement maybe, but nevertheless a true one.

I have already written a positive review of this film but there is one point which is annoying me.  This so called 'plot hole' about why the aliens would attack a planet which is 70% water.I'll tell you why.  Does anybody know what they are allergic to until they are exposed to it?  No.  Only upon exposure do you learn that it is harmful, possibly fatal.  Therefore, when they do learn that it is fatal to them, they do the rational thing, leave.This movie was frightening, though provoking and above all, very entertaining.  Maybe those out there who are reared on 'MTV rubbish' won't appreciate such a well crafted film, but those among us who prefer the film maker to treat the audience with a bit of respect and intelligence will.10/10P.S.

Night wanted to cash in on another blockbuster, not entertain his fans from sixth sense and unbreakable.  I'd comment on the plot, but I'm not really sure there was one.  Good acting is the only thing that kept me watching and not heading to the exits after the first half hour.

Imagine my disappointment when the incredibly stupid, unconvincing alien invasion turns out to be just what it seemed to be!

At least, I feel most of moviegoers felt smarter because they could ""figure out what it is about"" even though the message was concealed behind some obvious trivialities. I was annoyed by the whole ""nothing happens by accident"" idea rubbed in my nose all the time. I was also annoyed by X-filish background soundtrack that is supposed to mystify us. Music and sound in this kind of movies is there to uplift the suspension not to torture us with a false sense that something really important is happening all the time. ** spoilers ** I am not going to comment on painfully lame ""alien attack"" thing, nor on the ""profound"" sign to Phoenix to ""swing away"". ** end spoilers **. The movie just simply misfires as far as I am concerned.And what do you think about appearance of Mr. Alfred Shyamalan himself? Please...Let's start from ground zero, for it does not deserve better. For some great camera angles and a few creepy scenes towards the middle of the movie I give it +5. For being too self-important about its ""message"" -2.

In theese days of pointless movies that give the audience no credit for understanding ""Signs"" comes out and smacks the industry in the face.. Its nice to see a big budget movie come out with such style and craft... If your looking to see a scary movie with lots of guts and no brains then Signs is not your movie .. If your looking for terror that you create that you dictate this is your movie.Its Almost as if M. Night was a student of Hitchcock, From the Intro to the music everything is almost cut and dry Hitchcock(including his role in every movie). He crafts a very tight Charecter Study, yes its not a movie about aliens to most of your suprize. This movie is more about Faith ... Trust.. and well Signs.
********Spoilers***********************Some of the things i picked up in the movie where M's smart craft of having such a strong plot wrapped in a simple premis. Its easy to make alien movies but to have a movie about a mans faith which this movie is about is so amazing. I love the every little deatail from J. Phoenix charecter smashing the lightbulb to actauly never seen any danger to the end.. Also if you notice closely throughout the movie when he shows the water he lots of times pans to the cross.. I'm pretty sure that it was holy water but i could be wrong .. Also eluding the 3 middle east states where god was belived to be from .. or at least jesus.. could possibly the water they used be holy because where it was from??? also the ending is killer gota love the irony...**********Talking back to thoose who didnt like it********* For all of thoose i have seeen whining about how it was boring and slow and dull.. I am not sure what movie you were watching cause i dont remember one untense moment the whole flick.. Go see Halloween if u want guts .. maybe the simple plot that you were all looking for is more sutiable .. and please dont compare Six Sense to this completly diffrent movie diffrent style and diffrent mood all together.. To have a whole movie inside of a home and have about 5 charecters that mean anything is beyond me.. this is a true work of art and hopefully (lets pray ) of more good things to come from the other wise dull mainstream that has become of motion pictures.. with exception of a handfull this was the first widely hyped non indie movie ive seen in a long time where i had no negitive outlooks on itI give signs 10/10 thoo i still think one hour photo is gona be the movie of the summer",Signs

I also saw Unbreakable which was good but not mind blowing.  Just some fun entertainment and a reunion of one of my favorite duos Willis/Jackson.  I've been waiting to see Signs for quite some time now.  Shyamalan really knows how to market his movies by hiding what the reasons behind the crop signs are.  I wanted to see this movie just to find out what the heck the answer was.  What were the signs?  Who was doing it?  This was major when I watched the film because even from when the First credits were rolling I was excited and anxious.  I couldn't wait to find out the answer.  It was a great marketing job which affected how I saw the film.  Now to the actual film.  This story is probably the most wonderful work of story telling I have seen.  Just how everything ties together and the dialogue of lines makes me think, ""How could anyone ever think of this?""  I could better explain the what I mean here but that would mean spoilers, which I want to avoid.  Just go see it and you will know what I'm talking about.  It's a great story because there are the obvious connections you can find and then there are those deeper more complex connections that you can only find by seeing the film twice, yes  i have seen it twice.  I also love the title of the movie because I went into the movie thinking the title ""Signs""  was about crop signs, but I came out of the movie with a different perception on the title.  This is just a fantastic movie told in a fantastic way.  Shyamalan is a true story-telling genius.",Signs
1021,henrybaskerville,A Review,10,3 August 2002,"""The Sixth Sense"" established M. Night Shyamalan as a premier film maker. ""Signs"" further cements his reputation by delivering one of the most suspenseful, thrilling movies ever made.By far the best film of a summer that has had its share of quality titles (""Minority Report"", ""Road to Perdition"") ""Signs"" is better than anything out there, far surpassing even Night's own ""Sixth Sense"".I do not wish to divulge any key plot points, but a scene of home video footage is one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen.The film deals with several issues regarding spirituality, and Mel Gibson,playing the father of the family who lost his faith after his wife was killed in a car crash, does a fine job of conveying his character's conflicted feelings. This film is a jewel, something that should not be missed. The best film of the summer is ""Signs"", a surreal adventure that will leave you with goosebumps long after you leave the theater. ***** (out of five)",Signs
1022,xoid24,This is one of the best movies I've ever seen!,10,18 February 2003,"A lot of other people who left their comments didn't seem to like the movie, but I personally think the movie was great! The Sixth Sense is NOTHING compared to this movie! (I don't know what people liked so much about that movie anyway.) Not only was Signs scary, but it was funny too! If for no other reason, watch this movie for the humor.",Signs
1023,JFogliasso,"This was a great, inspirational film!",7,5 August 2002,"I went to this movie full of anticipation based on the fact that I enjoy most Mel Gibson films. Unfortunately, it ended up not being what it was advertised as being about. The crop circles, which I thought that the movie was about, were definitely not one of the central ideas to the movie. It dealt more with losing faith, and then trying to regain it. The character development was one of the stronger points of the movie, and the audience seemed to connect with the family in the movie. While the ending was unfulfilling, I felt that the movie in all was definitely worth ones time and money to check it out. In the end I give this movie a 7.5 out of 10. Enjoyable, but not one of the years best.",Signs
1024,abelishka,"Scary, but without much meaning",8,3 August 2002,"The problem with Signs is that it tries too hard to mean more than your usual scary-alien-invasion-movie.  Shyamalan hits us over the head with his central character's grief over his wife's death and his ensuing loss of faith.  Even the swing of Mel Gibson--preacher turned non-believer--is extreme. This lack of subtlety, however, helps when it comes into swing in the scariness of the movie.  It is claustrophobic and tense; Shyamalan uses his actors' fear to excite the emotion in the audience, rather than special effects and explosions.  He falls rather short of Hitchcockian, but the end result is worth seeing nonetheless.",Signs
1025,MeanderingMegan,"Not Bad, But Not As Good As Expected",6,4 August 2002,"I went to see this movie with such high expectations.  The trailer was great, The Sixth Sense was awesome and my hopes were that M. Night would live up to the same high standard on this film.  Sadly though, he didn't. The subject matter was juicy, the possibilities were endless, and although I did scream a couple of times in my seat, the movie never gave the payoff that one waits for in a stellar film.  Gibson was great, no fault on his part, as was Joaquin Phoenix and the two kids, but the film seemed to missing something in the equation that took it out of the league of exceptional and into the category of a near miss.  After having looked forward to seeing this film for a month, it was a letdown.  That being said, it's still a better summer movie than most other choices and certainly seemed to satisfy a lot of other audience members -  my advice, see it on a weekend afternoon when you've got some extra time on your hands to kill.",Signs

Very emotionally filled, and keep an eye on the bat.Because I'm typically bull headed, I almost didn't get to enjoy the show at all. A piece of advice (for any movie): Get there early, OR exchange your ticket for the next showing! Being frustrated at getting a poor seat can just ruin your movie time. Focus on the movie, not the lousy seating! :-)Signs gave a new viewpoint to an old story.

Just so that you know: There's no big surprise ending. The movie doesn't need one, it's strong enough as it is.Go and see it. Expect nothing and just enjoy yourselves as the story unfolds.

1028,ArmedMonkeyRescue,"Not the greatest movie of all time, but still a damn sight better than most.....",9,11 August 2002,"The main problem with reviews for certain movies is that they can only negatively influence your perception of the film when you finally see it. The less you know about Signs, the better. Do not expect anything in particular. If you have not seen it, I recommend that you stop reading this review after the first paragraph. I won't be revealing anything about the plot, but the simple fact is that Signs is a rare movie, one that does not need a $100 million marketing vehicle to sell patrons on the story before they even get to the theater. If you enjoy simply sitting back in your seat and inviting the filmmaker to tell you a story, your time will be well spent.After reading a few negative reviews, it seems that some people went to the theater expecting to see Independence Day II. Complaints that the alien wasn't dazzling enough, whines that it was boring and nothing happened in the movie...you people have been fed a steady diet of ""Let us do the thinking for you"" stories for so long that you're now completely unacquainted with the concept of ""delayed gratification."" NOT seeing the aliens more than we did was a GOOD thing. You just don't realize it. This is the kind of movie that no one seems confident enough to make anymore, with a few notable exceptions. The very BEST stories anyone can tell (and in case you forgot, that IS what's most important in any decent movie, is the STORY. George Lucas, make a note of that) have to do with people, and that's what Signs is about. Real fear in a movie has almost nothing to do with nifty CGI effects and creepy aliens ripping off heads and limbs (although that IS sometimes pretty cool), but it has a LOT to do with how well the filmmaker and actors convey fear through the situations and characters.
This was a decent way to spend a couple of hours, as long as your cinematic diet is not the equivalent of chili Fritos and Mountain Dew. If you're looking to be spoon-fed a skeletal story that's merely the framework for expensive visuals, stay away from Signs. But if your tastes are more mature than that of the average waterhead who keeps dragging the film industry down with their crappy opinions about crappy movies (i.e. Attack of the Clones), fork over a few bucks and give this a try.",Signs
1029,quiksilva19,No one has an imagination anymore!!!! Great Movie!,10,10 August 2009,"I thought this movie was excellent! It did not deserve the bad reviews it got. Does anyone have an imagination anymore?? The people who said this movie had plot holes were not thinking correctly. Maybe the reason the aliens had no idea that they were allergic to water is because their planet did not have any water on it. Maybe they were scouting our planet to see what resources we had. Could it have been that this was their first time off of their spaceship and that from now on they will know better. Maybe the crop circles were made to mark where they needed to get off of their ships and scout while being still being efficient and covering equal ground. The reason the alien was able to be locked in the pantry was because on his planet they have no need for doors or handles or locks or any combination there of. Or maybe he wasn't smart. I think the reason they were able to pick up the aliens voices was because they were on a different frequency then the government. We were never told that the government didn't pick up the signal. The reason Mel Gibson's character was angry at God was because he didn't understand how his wife could be taken like she was and in her final moments speak nothing but gibberish. The reason he found God again was because he found out in the end that God allowed her to save her family with her final words. That was enough to let him realize that there is a reason for all things and that God loved him and had a purpose for him still. I believe the director was trying to get us to use our minds and our imaginations. That isn't too much to ask, is it??",Signs

1031,toneil,A unique film which challenges us to use our minds not just our eyes,10,18 September 2002,"First off I would like to say that I noticed that there were many people who commented that this film was not what they expected. It wasn't scary enough, there wasn't enough excitement, etc., etc.  I, myself thought that this was a pleasant surprise.  ""Signs"" was not just another sci-fi thriller with no point.  It was a great tale of faith and redemption.It amazes me how many people didn't seem to get this point.  The film, to me doesn't really even fit into the genre of science fiction.  The aliens are simply used as a vehicle to help deliver the film's message. The aliens could just as well have been thieves or murderers who broke into the house. The movie's point would still have been made.Speaking of the film's message, I know that a lot of cynics out there think that the films message is an over used cliche.  I disagree.  In a world where all we see around us is pointless death and destruction I feel the themes in this film are very relevant and revealed in an original and clever fashion.As for those of you who can't get past the ""gaping holes"" in the plot such as a race of intelligent aliens who can't even break a wooden door to get into a cellar, can you tell me of any film that doesn't have a hole somewhere in the storyline.  **SPOILER**  Let's take the classic thriller ""Jaws"" for example.  You tell me how you can blow a gigantic shark to pieces, scattering it's blood and flesh everywhere and not attract countless other sharks.  Brody and Hooper would never have paddled their way to any shore without being killed by other sharks.  But that's okay.  I can get past all of that because there were so many other great aspects of this film.  Bottom line is that you can tear apart any plot if you really want to. **END OF SPOILER**I think what happened was that some people went to this film wanting to sit back and not have to think about what they were watching and got upset when the found out they were going to have to use their brains a little.  To me, the more thought that you have to put into a film usually means the more your going to get out of it.""Signs"" was a great film, with a great story and a great message.

1032,stu_locorp,Dial M for Night,10,10 November 2002,"If M. Night Shyamalan is truly the Alfred Hitchcock of the multiplex generation -- as his prodigious stylistic talent and penchant for cameos suggests -- then composer James Newton Howard deserves credit as his Bernard Herrmann. The score that comes up under the opening credits for Signs is eerie, unsettling stuff, portentous without being overblown. It promises a scary night at the movies, and Signs delivers. This is the creepiest Hollywood thriller in a very long while and almost definitely this year's horror flick par excellence. By employing the same MO as The Sixth Sense -- establish sympathetic characters and believable situations before putting your audience though the wringer -- the writer-director crafts his most suspenseful and unnerving film to date.Retired pastor and widowed dad Graham (Mel Gibson) finds some strange patterns carved into his cornfield, which he suspects is a well-coordinated local hoax. His younger brother, a failed minor-league baseball player (Joaquin Phoenix), shares his skepticism, but the kiddies aren't so sure, especially when the younger one wakes up in the middle of the night saying she's seen something lurking outside her window.There's so much more to say about Signs than a mere recap of this straightforward set-up, but it would be doing the film a disservice to reveal its surprises. Shyamalan's methodical pacing and carefully deployed shocks are more effective if you assume as little as possible going in. It's fair to say that the crop circles are no hoax, and that the little farm home that houses Gibson and his brood will come to seem less quaint and more terrifying as things progress. If you bring a date, make sure they've cut their fingernails, or else they'll end up embedded in your forearm from prolonged clutching. It's just that kind of movie.ADAM NAYMAN",Signs

1035,jalbert3,In Defense of Signs,9,14 January 2003,"According to the theatrical success of this movie and high user rating ""Signs"" would have to be considered a popular and well-regarded movie. But if one were to just read the user comments on this site, it would appear that this movie was a total flop and a total waste of time for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  I have to respectfully disagree- I found this movie (watched late at night by myself) to be totally engrossing and entertaining....MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD... First of all, many people had a problem with the aliens invading a planet that was mostly water, a substance which they had to know was extremely hazardous to them.  I thought the movie made it clear that this was a desperate action by a desperate race on the brink of extinction. I'm sure that they would rather inhabit a world more hospitable to them- but the odds of them blundering into a planet that suits their needs perfectly are astronomical considering the vast distances between stars and the sheer infinite number of directions to travel.  Just finding a planet that offered an atmosphere they could breathe and temperatures they could tolerate would be a godsend!  Maybe they would just inhabit earth as a forward base while they continued to search for a more suitable planet to colonize.  Perhaps they had the technology to alter earth's climate once they were established here, if they had the ability to travel to other worlds, would this be so far fetched?  This ""plot hole"" isn't really that big of an issue to the central story, in fact I don't even think it is a plot hole at all! I found the minimalist approach in regard to slowly unveiling the aliens very intense and scary.  The build-up to first seeing the alien scout on the TV and the scene with the alien in the pantry both had me on the edge of my seat!  The hairs stood on the back of my neck when first glimpsing the image of the alien in the alley on the news clip... and I can't tell you the last time a scene freaked me out like that. Also, I found the whole issue of a man losing his faith after the death of his wife totally believable.  No one I talked to after watching this movie thought this plotline was ill-conceived or not feasible.Unless there are glaring, ill- thought out major faults in a movie, harping on small, under-explained, or misunderstood themes does not ruin a movie for me.  Some of these ""plot holes"" expressed by others are more suited in my opinion for ""slip-ups.com"" instead of a thoughtful review on this site.  In the movie ""Hoosiers,"" it was never explained how the point-guard named Buddy rejoined the team after getting kicked off the team along with his friend Merle.  He just magically reappeared one game.  It turns out that the scene with him rejoining was lost on the editing room floor.  But that minor point never ruined the movie in my mind.  Maybe through the editing process some of these themes so many of you had trouble with would have been better explained, but at the cost of a 3+ hour movie. Sometimes it's better not to dwell on the minutiae, but rather step back and see the work as a whole.  This criticism is not directed at anyone that didn't like the movie overall, but rather for those who chose to just let a few points that they couldn't reason out or use imagination to overcome let ruin a movie that so many of us (7.5 overall rating on this site) have found to be well worth our time.",Signs

Finally, someone has decided to create an extra-terrestrial invasion movie that doesn't rely on special effects, galactic spaceships that can level cities and fancy hi-tech weaponry but on the reactions of one family. This movie had everything that I could've hoped for, the discreet appearance of the creatures, the claustrophobia it projected, the intense and moving memories of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and the determination. This movie never set out to become a blockbuster because in many ways it didn't have to. M. Night Shyamalan delivers to us every time a disturbing look at what could happen; watching Independence Day (1996) I soon realised that about twenty minutes into the movie that this was highly unfeasible (despite loving the movie) and the same for War Of The Worlds (1953/2005) but with Signs it uses accounts that we are familiar with, strange lights in the sky, crop-circles, worldwide confusion, these attributes are perfect and we know them! This is a scary look at perhaps feasible possibilities and has certainly made me think twice about what eyes could be watching us.As for the performances, Mel Ginson delivers the best performance of his acting career since Braveheart (1995) with the powerful emotion he uses to deflect the death of his wife and the survival of his isomorphic son. Joaquin Phoenix completely alters his character from Gladiator (2000) from a tyrant to a loving uncle who will strive to keep his family from collapsing from panic. All in all, this movie is brilliant and those expecting a bloodbath are going to be disappointed!",Signs
1039,michael310162,Yet another let down,2,29 March 2005,"As with all his previous films (and The Village after it) Night has the ability to keep an audience initially intrigued ,there's no doubt about that - but the pay-off, the climax, the BIG TWIST (T.M) turns out to be pretty obvious from the first five minutes. If only there were such a BIG TWIST (T.M) to partially save this film. Have to agree with most of the other anti-Signs comments here...major plot faults, limp acting and just the occasional interesting direction.I guess, for me at least, he always promises much more than he delivers.

1041,kybo_king7,Signs is definitely overrated.,3,19 September 2003,"CAUTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSWhen I went into the theater to see this movie, I was expecting an X-Files-esque alien story, with lots of shadow play and psychological suspense.  I thoughtthere would be a lot more buildup from the crop circles than there is.  I was disappointed. Signs has potential, but that's all there is.  This movie tries to be a family story, a sci-fi thriller, and an underdog-overcoming-the-odds tale.  Each of these genres has its merits, but not when spliced together.  Signs has many good points, such as the first, say, half an hour.  Unfortunately, M. Night Shyamalan tries to do too much with it.  In the course of the movie, I started to care less and less about the characters.  I didn't care about their fears and past misfortunes, and I certainly didn't care what became of them.  I also began noticing more than a fewinconsistencies in the plot, not to say blatant hypocrisies.  WARNING:SPOILERS ARE APPROACHING!  First of all, if the aliens melt when they touchwater, wouldn't the nighttime dew in the cornfields kill them?  What about the fact that water vapor is in the air?  Wouldn't their skin melt?  Why are they kidnapping creatures that are 80 percent water?  Why are they attacking aplanet which has two thirds of its surface covered in water?  Another problem I have with the monsters is that they have mastered interstellar travel, yet they can't figure out how to break into a boarded-up house.  Finally, (SPOILER!SPOILER!) one of these supposedly advanced beings gets beaten by a guyswinging a baseball bat.  A freakin baseball bat!!!  Has anyone even heard of guns?  Why didn't the army try shooting them, for God's sake?  My majorproblem with Signs, however, was the interjection of mushy spiritual crap atmoments of suspense.  Family film parts absolutely kill suspense, and beat its corpse with a stick. As I say, there are good parts of this film, but the director should stick to doing one thing at a time, and not try to please everyone all at once.",Signs
1042,gavinayling,"Slow, boring and causes you to lack empathy with the characters",1,19 May 2005,"This film starts slow. If you notice this and think that it may pick up, do not be fooled - it does not.The film starts with promise, the slowness is initially put down to building suspense but the suspense leads nowhere.The idea that something serious might happen means that you should at least care slightly about the characters. Instead Mel Gibson just seems rude and uncaring, his brother lacks zeal and the children deserve to be eaten by something.Avoid and then, if it chases you, avoid this film more seriously. Do not succumb to the Sci-fi pretence... It belongs to another genre altogether.",Signs
1043,DeathandTaxes22,Shyamalan is Getting Closer.,9,14 January 2004,"Reading reviews on this site and the Signs message board can be a bit confounding. It would seem a lot of people either are getting caught up in the ""plausibility"" aspect of the ending, which Hitchcock remarked to Truffuat about, or they were disappointed the final scenes didn't end in some type of cataclysmic battle. I think both criticisms miss the point. What Shyamalan is trying to do here ( for the most part he succeeds) is both awe us, and make us consider more than just what the plot says is happening. After making the disappointing Sixth Sense which slowly made its way to an obvious ""twist"" ending, and the much better but still lacking Unbreakable, Shyamalan comes closer to realizing the potential that his talent makes so evident. This is the closest he has yet come to a masterpiece. The premature Hitchcock comparisons are fitting in some ways, the director knows how to utilize mis-en-scene for maximum impact and he does a very good job with the suspense scenes( I was on the edge of my seat two times on the second viewing of the movie, and many more the first time). Shyamalan is not there yet, but perhaps given a few more films and a perfect script he is closer to being thought of as one of the greats. This is no complaint though, I enjoyed this movie more than I have most so called big budget movies getting similar critical praise.   4.5/5",Signs
1044,jochooi,"Ahem, i beg to differ",1,23 January 2005,"Sure, its new, its different, its 'fresh', etc.But it suffers badly from lack of pace. I'm sure it depends on the type of audience you are. I come home from a long day at work busting my brains/guts out - I want to be quite simply entertained.Yes, if you watch a lot of movies (most people on IMDb) then the way this movie is presented will impress you because it is different.For me, if a movies goes down a different route - it had better be good - otherwise the next button I press is *off*Incidentally, I think there might be a slight bias in some of the comments which rate this one of the best movies (think deep guys and girls - think!)",Signs
1045,MxPersonGuyMan,★★★★,10,13 January 2016,"In the unraveling of a story, people expect a payoff. With Signs, the payoff is the unraveling. We pick up on strange frequencies given by the somber tone of the film. We tell ourselves that nothing is there, our senses desperately scream at us otherwise, and the film builds and builds and builds.The mastery of Signs isn't in its concept, but rather in the way it manages to sustain a certain tone of trepidation, and deliver upon it in progressively suspenseful ways to the very end. Movies like Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" have been wise in the ways they've concealed a crucial element to understanding the true nature of themselves right in plain sight-- the telling felt off, right up until their realities were overturned while leaving audiences frantically working out the logistics of the newly defined truth in their heads. Signs has honed this skill, and uses it to suspend our need for explanation while all around, things have never felt more wrong. The unease inherent in fearing something just beyond our ability to see and hear is something we are more receptive to than any other type of fear; command over this instinct is what separates bad horror movies from good ones, then good ones from great ones.From the opening credits, we are granted insight into how the movie works. At first, the words are introduced with slow fade-ins and the aid of subdued violins. Low-key, before a Hitchcockian score cuts through the repose and the title is introduced like a jump cut to something unfriendly. The title cards are now shown in regular cuts, but then- whoosh!- now they're zooming onto the screen with the score now in full Psycho-mode. This is escalation, and it reflects perfectly the aim of this film and the way it chooses to go about it. The opening shot is just as disseminating: a normal backyard in all respects, and yet... Something is Wrong.The backyard belongs to a farm in rural Pennsylvania, under the ownership of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his family of two kids, Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin). Graham is a former priest who seems to have lost his faith ever since an incident that left his family a little emptier. Bo, his daughter, cannot ever seem to finish a glass of water but has discomforting dreams that seem to mean something for the family; the dreams are never brought into the spotlight, cannily remaining in the fringes of the movie's focus for us to interpret. Morgan is the son who suffers from asthma and maintains his faith despite his father. They are accompanied by Hess' brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). They are already a broken family before the crop circles form in their field, and we start seeing things, signs. Of?Terror is quiet. We stare for longer than we should because we think we saw something. We listen intently, and hear nothing, and we listen harder. Skillfully done horror doesn't manifest in the form of tangible scares, but in their absence. You remember the saying by Hitchcock: ""There's two people having breakfast and there's a bomb under the table. If it explodes, that's a surprise. But if it doesn't..."" Dogs bark at nothing, the wind blows strangely, and it's as if what's hidden is right in the characters' faces. Right in the air they breathe. In a scene that has the characters parsing a book on the possibility of extraterrestrials, I thought back to Jaws.Whatever they are, the things we can't see, we perceive them through secondhand means. We see shadows, we hear noises, silhouettes in the night slink in and out of view. When footage of them is captured, the image quality is low and grainy; we see just enough. Fewer things are more disturbing than catching a glimpse of someone's, or something's, head dart behind a wall. Because our terror is inflamed by what we can't sense and justified by the few times we can, their presence extends far past what we can physically make of them and locks the whole movie in a state of omnipresent dread.Our knowledge of the aliens is as sparse as it is beside the point. News reports aren't that informative or knowledgeable-- realistically, they know as little as we do. Although we know the spaceships are there, we can't see them. We know there must be panic brewing down there, but we never see any rioting or commotion; by diverting the focus away from scenes of pandemonium in the streets and in homes, we aren't given a means of climactic catharsis standard to the aftermaths of alien invasion movies. The crop circles explain pretty much nothing and everything. We don't have to know where they come from, just that it's obviously unnatural. Our imaginations take care of the rest. Quite a bit is left up to the viewer's imagination, but Shyamalan gives us the tools to start out. When crickets suddenly stop chirping, he gives us room to consider why.The story is all the more real for keeping its scope limited to the experiences of a few. They live ordinary lives, are surrounded by ordinary things. That these events are transpiring is all the more unnerving because whatever normal is, this isn't. Signs gets under your skin, inside your mind, takes your most primal fears and plays hide-and-seek with them. Don't look in the pantry.",Signs
1046,bha099,Extraordinary suspenseful,9,10 September 2017,"When humans fear darkness and death, the real fear is the unknown. Whatever hides in the shadows is very often scarier than the beast itself. Shyamalan keeps the danger from us. We feel it, but we don't see it. And that is always scarier than constant gore and jump scares.I think Gibson and Phoenix did very well in this movie, their response to this atmosphere is very believable, the execution brilliant. The little girl does well too, the boy is okay.The score may be what impressed me most, it creates dread like nothing else in the movie. Along with the cinematography and the plot, it creates a constant unsettling vibe continuing throughout the entire movie.This is, in short, a brilliant thriller. 9/10.",Signs

The focus on the family dynamics was the best of the film to me. Each character was well defined and the actors performed brilliantly. The fact that the invaders were susceptible to water was fine with me. The flashbacks brought in story development in a suspenseful way. The photography was beautiful throughout. 
I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspense, family drama, and gorgeous scenic atmospheres. It was more about family, healing, faith, and redemption more than an alien invasion.",Signs
1049,Everton_Paul,"Mostly dreadful, with some redeeming features",3,25 February 2005,"This film could have been so, so much better. Its greatest weak points are 1) the overly religious theme and the complete pap that links coincidence, fate and religious faith, and 2) completely stupid and illogical storyline regarding the Aliens attack of the earth.The cinematography is good, but nothing special. Mel Gibson's acting is laboured. Joaquin Phoenix is better, and has real talent, but is wasted in this. The dialogue is cringe-worthy in many over the top sentimental scenes between Gibson and his kids.The best thing about this movie is the genuine build up of tension for the 1st hour or so. Like some of the best monster/alien movies, the creature(s) are only revealed a tiny bit at a time  and old (but good) tricks are used to keep the suspense high. Up until this point I was quite enjoying the film, and it 'had me going' a little.The finishing 30 mins does not do any justice to the build up, and the plot at the end is just silly and lame. I don't really know where to begin .. Well, OK, for starters, it seems absolutely ridiculous to me that an extremely advanced race of Aliens (as they must be to build space craft that can travel great distances in space and that can also be rendered invisible to our eyes when they get here) have toi) create crop circles to navigate the earth ii) cannot work out ways to smash down wooden doors and battened windows of a house.You would think that had they come millions of miles to 'harvest (????)' humans they would have come prepared with some sort of hi tech guns that paralyse us, or at the very least some suits that make themselves invisible (like their ships) or maybe carry some hi-tech equipment to aid them in their task. But oh no, they wander around our planet surface butt naked thereby enabling us to lock them in wooden pantries! Perhaps if we were told that the Aliens are giving us a sporting chance (a la the Predator alien that hunts Arnie) then we might be willing to suspend disbelief regarding their apparent incompetence in 'harvesting' an inherently inferior race (i.e. us) a little more, but we are not led to believe that they are doing any such thing. You would also think, that such an advanced race of Aliens would probably work out a way to feed themselves without having to travel round the galaxy looking for beings to 'harvest', assuming that they are 'harvesting' us for food (we are not really told). And if it's meat they want, you'd think they get better value harvesting cows, sheep and pigs, no? In fact, if they'd just have asked us, 'hey we need some food', I'm sure planet earth's leaders would have given them a good supply of meat. But no, they attack us and risk themselves in the process!Also why, if water is like acid to them, are they wandering around butt naked on a planet that has most of its surface covered in water and whose atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour??!!? Are we supposed to believe that bulk quantities of water 'melt' the aliens, but they can quite happily breathe our air complete with the high levels of water vapour that is in it?!? And if they don't breathe (we are never really told much about the aliens) then still the high levels of water vapour in our air would surely be a bit of a problem to them, no?There are just so many stupid inconsistencies in this film, it is almost quite laughable. And it is a shame really, because (as I said initially) the film is genuinely scary and suspenseful in the 1st hour. It's just that when the final credits roll, you think, 'hang-on a minute, that ending was just complete nonsense!!!'For all the hype M. Night Shyamalan is getting for writing, producing and directing his films, he really should learn a bit of science before trying to write a plot involving science fiction",Signs
1050,shooshkebob,Feel some viewers might have missed the signs,10,10 November 2019,"I was blown away when I first watched this and continue to be with every watch.
A really clever piece of writing that I fear some viewers are missing the symbolism of. This is not a movie abput aliens any more than it is a movie about religion. The decifer, I believe, is in it's title ""Signs"" Beautifully ambiguous, it mostly leaves the viewer to decide what that means to them through plot and purposeful (but sometimes easily missed) imagery.
The alien presence that some seem so hung up on (that also cleverly helps subvert the films genre) is merely a clever tool acting as the protagonist to forward the characters journey through their own belief of fate/ luck/ religion/ beliefs/ spirituality etc which they feel ultimately defines them and their life as a whole.
Whilst the aliens are integral to plot momentum, they are NOT what the film is about. The film centers on a family broken and lost by personal tragedy, the dad especially, as he loses his faith in both religion and his own personal worth (noted by his brother who has his own life come downs) which is doubly scarring as he was the priest and the social glue for an American small farming town.
It culminates in a series of unconnected ""coincidences"" that reaffirms Graham's (Gibson) faith in himself as both a father figure of his family where he sees he has failed, and as a Father of faith and support for the community.
We all search for meaning and design in our lives regardless of belief, and I think this movie speaks to that.
""What kind of person are you .."" speech encapsulates this in a bit shell.
Beautiful cinematography, pace, dialogue and casting.
If you watch this, go in with no preconceptions, an open mind and not expecting a movie about alien invasion.

M Night Shamylan weaved a great tale of alien invasion like no other I can remember. The focus is not on the aliens, the horror, the death, the battle, the big wigs trying to stop it...it's on every day people and it shows how something like this brings out the humanity in all of us. The back story...which really when you think about it can be considered as the front story...is one that so many can relate to...a tragedy eats away at a man and his family...causing him to lose faith...but then the aliens come!! and the family comes together to find out there are no coincidences...and faith is regained!! sound corny or cliché?...maybe...but M Night Shamylan presents this tale in such a way that it's hard not to be moved...and to cry along with Mel Gibson who really makes it all too real...what a great performance...so...if you are expecting an alien invasion thriller...skip it...the sci-fi logic and smarts is not all there...but look past that to the real story of humanity within this film...and you will be very pleased!",Signs
1053,ade72,Why Should I Care?,4,24 July 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I had been looking forward to seeing this movie- in my opinion, nothing has warranted much hype this year since ""Spider-man"".  I attended a screening already disappointed by one fact I had been warned about (if your interested, I'll put it at the end with a spoiler warning), but still slightly optimistic.I left ""Signs"" feeling very glad that I hadn't paid the $10 for it.  I have never cared before, but found myself very concerned that the character development was horrible!  Why did I care about these people?  Just because they lost their matriarch in a horrible (and completely non-logical) way? That just couldn't cut it for me...  I was glad to see Mel Gibson playing a role where he acts his age rather than trying to act forever the ""hunk"", but the rest of the characters were totally shallow.***POTENTIAL SPOILERS***My original disappointment before I even came to the theater?  I knew that aliens would be seen.  I'm a firm believer in leaving scary things up to the imagination, and hence yielding more scared movie-goers.  On the other hand, the first time you see an alien (via a children's birthday party home video on the news), it seems believable.  The ""home video"" quality seems accurate, and the fear in the people filming seems genuine.But after the film you leave with few answers to many questions...  How does Shyamalan's character figure out the water thing so easily?  Why so much build-up with Bo's water obsession?  What the heck did that alien do to Morgan?  Perhaps the least believable: ""Father, we decided since your wife is pretty much severed in half by a truck that we'd just leave her there until you got here, so you can watch her die!""  Actually, I lie...  The most unbelievable part is that a former reverend who no longer believes in his God after watching his wife die, would suddenly believe again after surviving an alien invasion!***END SPOILERS***BOTTOM LINE: If you can see this for free, do it.

1054,bouncer-3,Heaven on Earth,10,13 November 2002,"I was really reluctant to watch this movie as the South African critics had given it really bad reviews. They are obviously Aliens masquerading as humans. Mel Gibson gives the performance of a life time. He leads you through the most tumultuous roller coaster ride of emotional ups and downs from calmness to terror, from love to abject hate just by the expressions on his face. This is a must see. If you have ever questioned those ""coincidences"" in life go and see this movie. The casting of Joaquim Phoenix as his brother was sheer genius and the Author / Director's cameo appearance is tastefully done and helps to bring home his passion for the story. I was a bit put off at first by the way scenes never seemed to flow, nothing is flowing about this movie. Its very ""boxed"" time wise. By the end of the movie you realize why the Director did that.

I enjoy sci-fi and suspense very much, but I spent most of the movie squirming in my seat and checking my watch.  I don't mind movies that move slow (I loved Road to Perdition, which friends complained was too slow), but this one kept me struggling to stay awake.  Every time a little suspense started to build up, it was squashed by yet another dull flashback of Our Hero's wife's tragic demise.  Said demise was contrived to manipulate emotions, which always sets me off.  Note to Mr. Shyamalan: the audience isn't as stupid as you think.  Trust us to feel for your characters without manipulating us.  It would have been much more effective to show the horror of her death instead of just telling us about it.  Of course, that would have required lowering the cast's dosage of tranquilizers, which appeared to be fairly heavy.  The children especially seemed to wander about the movie in a fog; effective, perhaps, in evoking a mood, if we'd had anything at all to contrast it with.The worst part of the movie, though, was the bruises I sustained from the anvils being regularly dropped on my head.  It's all about faith.  I got it already.  I'd like to see Mr. Shyamalan go back to trusting his audience the way he did in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, which were truly wonderful movies.",Signs

Then I saw the trailer.Wow!I so wanted to like this film.  Although I disliked Sixth Sense (because of Haley Waley Osment and the blatantly obvious twist) I had loved Unbreakable (I know, going against the grain), and by the look of the trailer, Signs was going to be up there with Unbreakable.Oh dear!Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor, as is Mel Gibson, as is the youngest Culkin - but even they couldn't save this film from being the most overblown pile of nonsense ever...period.  The script was reasonably good, dialogue wise, but when it came to plot it seemed that M Night had fallen asleep at the keyboard, repeatedly bashed the zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz key with his head and thought that'll do'.  I couldn't work out if I was watching a sci-fi film in the style of Close Encounters, or a Carry On film as it veered from one extreme to the other.  This couldn't be the film I had seen in that trailer? Unfortunately, it was.There must have been a bit of a budget on this film, so where did it all go? Mel's pocket?  Just when it seemed like things were about to happen, the director decided that locking everyone in the basement, where they couldn't see anything would be 'really interesting'.  Maybe, if there had been more tension, more suspense it would've been interesting.  Unfortunately we were waiting for that for the entire length of the film, it never came.Then there were the characters.  I love character driven films, but when there are only about six main parts why does M Night takes one of those for himself?   Fair enough, take a cameo, walk in and out of a scene ala Hitchcock, but don't give yourself such a role again, please!  It's not fair on the viewer.The finale was the biggest cop-out of all, I thought I had seen a film with a reel missing.  Biggest let down of the year so far.All the way through the film my mind kept wandering back to that trailer, it made the film look great, exciting, suspense filled.  I started thinking 'Give the guy who cut that trailer a film to direct'Unless it's M Night, then don't.Like Joaquin's character in the film, a failed baseball player who hit so many strikes -M Night, for me you've hit two.One more and you are out!",Signs

'Signs' is actually a story about a reverend who loses his faith when his wife is killed in an accident and his personal struggle to reclaim it. That's it.  Yes the world is invaded by hostile beings who use crop circles as road maps and they try to snatch Mel Gibson and his family, for some reason, but these themes are lost in the sad puppy-dog looks of Gibson and Phoenix as they whine through the film and strive to prove how one is sadder than the other.Stiff acting, dabblings ripped out of E.T., Close Encounters, Independence Day, Alien and sappy emotional drama are all a viewer will get from this incredibly overrated waste of time.  The aliens show up, make crop circles, and everybody gets confused and concerned.  Then the aliens are actually spotted and the world sits on its hands, scared and unable to apparently do anything, at least in Mel Gibson's self-absorbing world.

1064,slaveofthelamp,M. Night Shyamalan Still Hasn't disappoined me!,8,3 August 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan has come to be one of my new favorite directors. His ability to create tension and suspense is literally amazing. And Signs is no exception.I've read some reviews of this movie where people thought it was too slow or didn't have enough action. People, this is NOT an action movie. This is not Men In Black or ID4 (Blah). This movie is pure suspense, down to it's bones. Just like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable before it, the pacing of the film is slow and deliberate. Shyamalan uses every minute of the film to build tension.Overall, I thought the film was great. I'm now an official fan of this great director.PS: When I saw the movie in theaters, there were a couple scenes where a boom mic was obviously visible. However, I think this might just have been a problem with a specific reel, since I haven't seen anyone else talk about it. Lemme know if any of you have seen this also.",Signs
1065,Master Flix,What Signs is really about (SPOILERS!),7,16 September 2002,"WARNING: FULL OF SPOILERS!After leaving the cinema, I was somewhat confused, but sure that the movie was NOT about alien invasion. Later on, I figured out some pieces of the puzzle. First of all, I was shocked after reading some many posts in which people thought that the movie was crap, because the aliens had no weapons, earth is covered by water mostly, the aliens were green, man-like and so on... It think it was pretty clear, that it wasn't about aliens invading earth (this was definitely a metaphor).There are many scenes that should really disturb you when think this movie has no second, subtle meaning: E.g., the boy killing the dog with a bbq fork (very strange, should be impossible, and the reaction of the other people is strange as well). Generally, some of the main characters act strangely in numerous scenes, which together with some of the little girl's comments might hint at a dream. The vet who accidently killed Gibson's wife plays a very important role. He is sorry for what he did, but Gibson is unwilling to forgive him (in one of the key scenes of the movie). He lost his faith including forgivingness as one of the major parts of chritistianity. Before leaving, the vet tells him that there is an alien in his house. This alien is the ONLY one that is seen in the entire movie (except the one on TV). This is Gibson himself, i.e. his faithless part, a demon. He created this demon by giving up his beliefs. The vet was haunted by the demon, couldn't take it anymore, and left. Most importantly, you never see an alien doing harm to anyone! Even when attacked by Phoenix, he does not defend himself. This is not an alien and he is not hostile. I believe the main topic of the movie is Gibson's bad relation to his son (after having lost his faith): his son wishing Phoenix was his father, the dispute at dinner,... If you paid attention, you might have noticed, that the alien (Gibson's faithless part) only haunts his son (in the cellar, upstairs). One of my friends was 100% sure to see a kind of reflection of Gibson on the alien's skin in one of the final scenes. This could be explained by the fact that the alien represents a part of Gibson. The three remaining characters are able to jointly displace the demon: Phoenix' baseball bat, the boy's asthma, the girl's water toxication problem. You can basically forget most the stuff that is shown on TV and said in the radio (about the invasion) as this is NOT real. E.g., it could be part of a dream. However, some things are hinting: ""people in middle-east"" found out how to get rid of the aliens (middle-east is the birth-place of many religions), water (holy water is of great importance in various religions) destroys the demons,...Things that are ambiguous, but that I don't understand (yet :) :The boy killing the dog (the dog became aggressive when they tried to give him water...) - The killing of the second dog - The army office scene - It seems like the little girl had some ambiguous lines, that I was unable to comprehendFinally, I wonder how one can ignore the subtle meaning of the film: aliens that can fly through space but cannot open wooden doors?? The same alien that Gibson met at the vet, comes to his house to take his son? And, think about it: If the director would have wanted to show evil aliens, he would have at least made a different ""fighting"" scene at the end. The ""alien"" seems pretty harmless. There are no flying saucers, just ""lights"".Besides all that stuff, I didn't like the movie that much. I liked the first part, but was disappointed by the ending. The same holds for Unbreakable.",Signs
1066,MyDixieNormous,I think a lot of you don't get it,10,5 August 2002,"**********POSSIBLE SPOILERS THROUGHOUT**********I've read some of the reviews here on the IMDB and one thing comes to mind: A lot of you have no idea what the movie is about, or just didn't pay attention to the dialogue.  There's a lot of....1) Why did the aliens come to a planet that's 2/3 water when they are harmed by water.2) Why did the alien look so cheap.3) The characters don't act like people really would.
Well allow me to try to explain it to all of you nay sayers.
1) There are a lot of explanations for this.  One could be that they would have inhabited the other third of the planet.  That's like what, 400 square feet.  The world's a small place right?  Another explanation could be that they weren't aware of the fact they could be harmed by water.  Sure it seems silly but tell me, how does one know when they are allergic to a certain medicine or when one doesn't like a certain type of food.  You aren't born with the knowledge that you aren't going to like steak before you even try it.2) For those of you that don't understand the film I'm going to try my darndest to explain it to you.  For those of you that did understand the movie but still had something bad to say about the look of the alien all I can say is that the Director is presuming not to know what aliens actually look like.  Since none of us have actually seen them or know the extent of their existence he's not going to show us a tall lanky green alien with a huge head and big yellow eyes.  That's also why all the scenes where we see the aliens the best is somewhat blurry.  That was Spielberg's mistake with A.I.  He used the same aliens from Close Encounters.  Unless he has a few aliens living in his backyard I assure you he doesn't know what they look like if they do exist.3) I find this totally untrue and I'm going to cite certain examples from the movie to show you that.  The scene at dinner where Mel Gibson breaks down and then the children come over and hug him.  I've heard it said that no child of that age would do what was done after having just been yelled at.  He would most likely go running into the other room.  I have a 10 year old niece that is actually one of the smartest people I know.  Smarter than a lot of the adults I know as well and would have handled the situation the same way.  Just because someone is a child doesn't mean that they always act like a baby and start whining and crying.  And vice versa.  Just because someone is an ""adult"" doesn't mean they always act like an adult.  The best scene of this movie is another example of this.  When Mel Gibson crouches down to his sons height and proceeds to tell him of the day he was born. How awesome of a scene is that?  If it hadn't hit yet, that scene should have been pretty clear that this wasn't a movie about an alien invasion but rather something else.  And that is most likely what a real father that thought he and his family was going to die would do.  They wouldn't have run.The Director is not an idiot and he is not going to treat the movie going public like they are idiots.  That is why at the beginning of the movie there wasn't a disclamier saying that this movie is not really about aliens and that's why there aren't going to be very many aliens throughout the movie.  He left it up to you to figure out what the movie was about. Obviously a lot of you had trouble doing so.  If you wanted to see an ID4 type movie then go rent it.  That may be the kind of movie that racks up all the millions but I guarantee you that the Director would rather his movie tanks while making it his way then it makes millions by being a cheesy alien film.",Signs
1067,jafowler,"Decent film, but...",7,26 August 2002,"***Spoilers***I think this movie had two working titles, and they couldn't figure out which one to use, which is why they settled on ""Signs"". The first was, ""Episcopal priest regains lost faith"". The second was ""Blue Man Group proves to be history's stupidest invaders"".Here's the strengths:  I like character-driven movies. Say what you will about whether the script or the acting were convincing, this was deeply character driven. Shyamalan felt much more comfortable with this movie, going for a few jokes that were decent. The ""scary"" parts were of the ""POW!"" variety, often accented with a tympani, and appeared to be spaced evenly, in a very calculated fashion, throughout the film. Although I found those moments reasonably fun if not all that startling, the audience around me screamed like startled geese, which I guess made it a little more interesting. The philosophical heart of the movie seemed kind of forced, especially Hess chanting ""There are no coincidences, his lungs were closed"" over and over again, but it was ultimately quite satisfying. As a father myself, I was easily drawn into the father-as-protector story, and I enjoyed that quite a bit. Shyamalan also did a good job of building suspense, working well with glimpses and noises rather than all-out attack. He obviously knows the truth that so many filmmakers seem to have a hard time grasping:  The unseen is much scarier and more suspenseful than the seen. Likewise, he has a Kubrick-esque talent for letting a scene develop slowly. Action is often unnecessary, and the biggest payoffs come from a patient director. There was plenty of that in this flick.Weaknesses:  Like ""The Sixth Sense"" (which I liked a whole lot more), this film telegraphed its revelations from miles away. The super-strong homerun hitter will, of course, save the day with a baseball bat. Saw that one a mile away. ""I'm moving near a lake, because for some unexplained reason I think they don't like water"". Another telegraph. Not a big deal, but when the movie is supposed to have this big payoff at the end, it would be better if there were some surprises. There were none. And if you're going to try to make a plot point about how all the ships are hovering next to crop circles, PLEASE PLEASE don't, in the next moment, show me ships hovering over the Capitol in Washington, DC. (which also happens to be surrounded by water). And I couldn't help wondering why the Hess family, who had grown up in that farmhouse, had no idea where the coal chute was. Or why the invaders could leap 20 feet in the air in a heartbeat, but couldn't get past a loosely-locked door (or why they gave up on the coal chute, since no one actually blocked it much). I'm not a nitpicky moviegoer. Most of this stuff just washes by me, so when I actually notice it in a movie, the filmmaker must really be letting his guard down. And, of course, there's the whole ""Why invade a water-covered planet if it kills you"" question that I'm sure many have already raised.I never know what to make of movies that draw heavily and obviously on other influences. When the camera dropped, Blair Witch-style, in the basement, I fully expected to see Mike standing in the corner, waiting to be killed. The obvious references to other classics in the genre were equally distracting, but they didn't have to be. But with all that said, I still think this was the best movie I saw this summer. I'm not quite sure how it made it so high onto the imdb all-time list, but it was a lot better than Minority Report. It's worth the 8 bucks, especially if you can see it in a full theater.",Signs

The obvious one to recall is ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", and less significant but unfortunately overlooked gems such as ""I Married A Monster From Outer Space"".If viewed in equivalent terms (and you are a fan of such films) you might appreciate it.

1071,joekm-1,A perfect blend,9,23 July 2006,"M. Night definitely knows how to scare us. In the film we see non traditional camera angles and a whole slew of eerie sounds. He manages to get the feeling of complete alien invasion without the overuse of special effects which sometimes ruin movies. On the surface this looks like a scary sci fi alien movie, but after watching it is much much more. I went in to the movie expecting nothing more than the average. A little bit scary with a typical plot. This was far from it. The story is a perfect blend of classic sci-fi elements, religious messages and appropriate comic relief. In the same movie I laughed, cried and froze with fear. The religious message was pretty powerful in the film, but I feel it wasn't too much to handle. The acting was far better than i expected. Gibson stepped away from a typical role and delivered a convincing performance. Joaquin Pheonix was cast in a role perfect for him and did a great job to keep the movie from getting too serious or too comical at any time. He is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The musical score my James Newton Howard was the icing on the cake in my opinion. The unique score presents itself in the opening credits and is found throughout the whole film, giving it a sense of unity. Without the music, the movie would not have the same potent effect.Even though I am not very religious myself, i felt very comfortable with the theme that was presented. We are not alone. We may not know who or what, but there is something else out there. There are no coincidences and even though things may seem bad with a little bit of faith and courage things will be alright. Believe in yourself, trust your family and keep your faith. As I said, it's a powerful message, but trust yourself you can handle it. THis movie come highly recommended by me and i feel almost anyone would enjoy it. Powerful, exciting, scary and completely captivating, there is no reason to not see it.",Signs
1072,dramasylum,One Sign: Do Not Enter,1,3 August 2002,"The first coherent thought that came to me about a third of the way through this film was: ""Change it, Beavis, change it!""  Mike Judge, however, understands the nature of spoofing and how and when to use appropriate citation techniques.  This film shamelessly borrows original material that it tries to push off as its own. It does not do so in any effort at homage - it's called plagiarism - a practice that gets most students expelled.  In Hollywood lately, it's just the acceptable practice and has the possibility of earning you an Oscar nomination.  On the plus side, Mel Gibson proves once again that he can add dimension to any character he delves into.  He leads a talented cast in an otherwise trite and miserably disappointing film.  If you are looking to escape the summer heat, attending this film will offer you a well air-conditioned spot for a siesta.  If you are looking rather for intellectual or emotional stimulation, stay at home.",Signs
1073,webmaster-88,Classic film style makes a modern classic,9,1 November 2002,"The modern ""classic"" monster films - Jaws, Alien, etc. relied upon suspense rather than shock tactics. This is mostly due to budgetary limitations, rather than style. For example, in Jaws, the shark model just didn't work. The production team found ways around it, and created a really scary, suspense filled film.In more recent years, film-makers have resorted to showing the monster in all its glory - George Lucas purposefully did this Empire Strikes Back Special Edition.Signs is a retreat from this habit. Barely do we see the monster (in this case, Aliens) at all, except fleetingly, or in shadows. The result is a suspense that can almost be cut with a knife. Literally. The first moment that the monster is seen, the whole audience is searching for it, desperate to find out what it looks like.This suspense could very easily break down into schlock horror, but M. Night S* cunningly interweaves moments of humour into the film. However, the build up for this suspense also results in the first act feeling painfully slow.Signs is not a work of true genius, but it is a valiant effort by man who is one. Without this slow section, the finale would not, nor could not have the emotional impact it does.I rate it 4.5/5",Signs
1074,burningscarf,Wholesome Sci-Fi,8,4 August 2002,"Someone [Manoj Night' Shyamalan] finally made a wholesome science fiction film. `Signs' is the ultimate contradiction to the lame and flimsy `Independence Day.' Shyamalan realizes that emotions are so much more effective than explosions. `Signs' is 'the' most convincing and freaky depiction of an alien invasion that I have ever seen. There are no laser guns, no mind reading, and no bull. There are just real people, like you and I, with real emotions.",Signs
1075,alimoyeth,Masterpiece!,10,24 June 2020,"Signs is directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan, and it stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix in a science fiction thriller about a family that sees a bunch of crop circles in their cornfield, and that there's a creature of some kind that lurks around their house, making them slowly realize that they are not alone.When an M. Night Shyamalan film works, it really works: Signs is a pure example of it. Previously I talked about ""The Guest"" and it's crazy rating. The same thing happened with Signs again. I am honestly shocked by the 6.7 rating. I gave this movie 8.5 as more of a statement, anything less than an 8 is criminal. I have absolutely no idea about why it is highly underappreciated and misunderstood by critics and audiences. I've only seen the film twice, and I can say that Signs is one of the most suspenseful, well written, and well-acted alien movies ever made. This film has everything, even better, in terms of what I'd ever wanted in a movie. This film has suspense, intensity, emotions, great acting, and the message on fate all in one.The best thing about this film is how realistically the character's response to the emergency. I think if anything this insane were to actually happen people would at first be wholly unbelieving, then skeptical, moderately anxious, and then full-blown terrified. They would sit and watch the news all day, holding their loved ones close, board up their homes and hide or pack up and go as far away from the trouble as they could go.This movie is the reason why I like this director. M. Night Shyamalan is just best when it comes to depth and details in a film. His ability to create so much chilling, hair-raising tension is monumental. He can create tension from the simplest of scenes and creates characters that you truly care about. The movie has a great set up with sounds and visuals which makes it quite mysterious, leaving me on edge throughout the whole movie. It's a misfortune that he isn't making movies like this anymore nowadays.Signs is M. Night's BEST film (yes, even better than ""The Sixth Sense"" for me). I'm glad M. Night Shyamalan went for a more minimalistic approach to an alien film, instead of having overblown CGI explosions and chases (not that I don't have any problem with that, but it's nice to see something different). If you think, that this will be another one of those alien movies, you'd be very mistaken and also, it's not an alien movie just for sci-fi fans, it's a high-stakes drama for anyone. It's a fascinating personal story being told, while the world around them has changed in a heartbeat and challenges them to face their fears and regrets. I think Signs was one of the few sci-fi thrillers I've seen that makes me terrified because of its realism when I think of it.PS: Highly Recommended!

1076,gwitherspoon-1,"For Its 1, 2, 3 Strikes You're Out At the Old Ball Game",1,31 August 2006,"I recently saw this movie on DVD and I was really looking forward to it because I remember how much they were promoting it when it first came out, and after all, it was a Mel Gibson movie (with Joaquin Phoenix as the icing on the cake, how bad could it be?). I read most of the reviews on here before I saw the movie.For the first hour, I was on the edge of the couch, totally riveted to my television screen as I waited to find out what was going to happen next. But. . . in the back of my mind I was thinking ""I'm sure this isn't simply going to turn out to be about some stupid green aliens who supposedly want to take over the world. The crop signs have to mean something else, and they are just trying to mislead us by implying that it really is about aliens."" Boy was I wrong! Slowly, I came to the realization that this movie was the biggest piece of crap that I've ever sat through. No, it isn't a ""thinking person's movie"" unless you are remedial and on drugs. Why is it that every slow-moving, pseudo-spiritual film is thought to be so profound - are we trying to fool ourselves into liking this garbage? Are we afraid to admit just how silly the movie really is so we pretend that it has a deeper meaning to justify our having been foolish enough to spend 2 hours watching this drivel? Are we really such gullible sheep? Grant Hess was shallow, grim and boring - I didn't believe one single emotion he was pretending to have. I can't even imagine how he ever became an Episcopalian priest. Surely, as a priest he had to deal with life and death issues before so why would he think he would somehow be exempt from sorrow or death in his personal life? Isn't he supposed to believe in an after-life and feel that his wife has ""gone to a better place?"" How could he have enough Christian faith to even become a priest yet when he is faced with a personal tragedy of his own, be so quick to abandon his beliefs? It made him seem like a hypocrite - ""I'm a man of God but the minute I'm faced with a personal tragedy, I'm done with religion."" How shallow is that? I certainly wouldn't want him to be my priest. Then, when he is faced with the prospect of evil aliens, all of a sudden he knows exactly what God is thinking and why things happen the way they do. What a simplistic ass! The children were acting more like aliens than the green dudes - they were unnaturally pale, emotionless, coldly logical and moved like they had taken one too many tranquilizers. Even the sheriff seemed like she was on Valium. After she asked them a few questions about the intruder in their cornfields, we never saw her again. It made you wonder if that town was peopled with humanoid robots. Evidently, Shamalyan doesn't know anything about dogs - do some research, buddy. No German shepherd is going to turn on his owners the way the one in the movie did - if anything, he would be trying to protect the children and probably give his life protecting them, not try to kill them because he sensed a few green strangers lurking around.What about that wife? - she was supposedly sliced in half by a truck and held together because she was wedged between two vehicles, yet she was able to have a last inane chat with her husband. I don't think any of the characters were well developed and you really didn't know what made any of them tick. You didn't get a sense of what their life was normally like until this whole crop circle business started. If this was a working farm, where were the hired hands? Why would you be terrified of these so-called signs and assume that they had to be related to aliens? If you were mindless enough to stay in a deserted house and face down beings who wanted to kill you, wouldn't you at least have a stockpile of things to use as weapons like knives, axes, tire iron, whatever? Wouldn't you put aside food and water and blankets for your family before barricading yourself in the basement and wouldn't you have enough sense to make sure your child had his medicine? The way that little boy was snorting on that inhaler every few minutes, I'm surprised there was anything left in it. If his asthma was that severe, he shouldn't have been on a farm at all. And how stupid were the aliens - just stand there while someone beats you to death with a baseball bat or fall and wait for a glass of water to fall on your head and melt you. Who says extraterrestrials are supposedly superior? Wherever these airheads were from (The Naked, Stupid, Clueless Planet for Green Rejects, I'm guessing), I'm surprised they survived at all.I didn't care about anyone in this film and as far as I was concerned the green men could have slurped all of them down.",Signs

Location, sets, script, filming and casting were superb.  From the interesting method of credits at the beginning, the special effects were exactly right and in the right quantity to help pull you in without typical overload of most movies.  The use of sound and the unseen were most effective.  There were plenty of places this movie could have gone, but the package presented was perfect.

I can't really explain what's so bad about it without spoiling it, so:***********SPOILERS***********Nothing makes any sense. Water-allergic aliens landing on Earth without protective suits? Don't give me that ""alien logic"" stuff. It's just dumb.The divine message from God is ""take the big bloody piece of wood and whack the alien over the head"".

1084,Kickstand_911,Not good at all.,5,12 August 2002,"I have several problems with the movie. SPOILERS1. These aliens can take a baseball bat shot to the back and still stand, but cant kick a door in?2. They are referred to as very resorcefull, yet they cant take boards off of windows?3.  Why would aliens who die when confronted with water invade any planet that is covered by 71% water?4.  What if it rained?  Movie over!5.  Why the hell wouldnt anyone pick up a knife or a bat earlier in the movie, come on, these things want you dead fight back.6.  When dumb and dumber are nailing up the bedroom doors, does it occur to anyone else that the doors opened in, not out, making the boards virtually useless.7.  Did anyone else see the microphone bobbing in and out at top center on their screen?8.  If schools were canceled because of the alien sittings, why werent his kids in school at any point before then.9.  The sixth sense was a good movie, unbreakable was unwatchable.10.  Kill a lady with a $3,000 truck, get a $40,000 SUV?11.  If you had 5 minor league homerun records you would be in the majors no matter how many time you struck out, Reggie Jackson!I dont know how anyone can get past the water thing and still think that this was a good movie, it may have been entertaining but the basic premiss misses big time.",Signs
1085,IMDB808,"I saw the sign and it read ""Excellent""",10,5 August 2002,"This movie is a beautifully done thriller because it is suspenseful and thrilling without resorting to high tech CGI explosions or gore to get the point across. I loved it. M. Night is a director that I've been following ever since seeing ""The Sixth Sense"". To me he already ranks up there with Stanley Kubrick, Luc Besson and other spectacular directors. I won't ruin any of the plot for you. This movie does everything that I WISH the X-files (movie) did for me and more. A truly must-see movie!",Signs

There are so many emotions involved in this movie... at one time you are laughing out loud... the next you are crying (or if you are a guy like me just crying on the inside  )... then you are nearly soiling yourself from the intense thrilling scenes... then you are thinking about your faith in God! I seriously hope that this movie gets some recognition around awards time simply for its uniqueness... M. Night Shyamalan is a genius!,Signs
1087,TJConn728,"Very good, until you think about it",8,13 August 2002,"*Contains Minor Spoilers* From the captivating television commercials for ""Signs"" one would think this is a movie that is mostly about crop circles and aliens, but it is actually about much more.  In fact, although the aliens are of major importance throughout the movie, the crop circles play only a minor role, and are simply one reference to the title, which is more directly related to the sometimes seemingly random events in one's life.  It is much too complicated to explain without giving away the plot, but this movie may not be what you are expecting. Instead, ""Signs"" is a rare movie that successfully blends suspense, comedy, drama, and horror, among other things, into one film, while still delivering a strong message.  Despite this, I think this movie has much better entertainment value than message delivering ability.  Throughout the film, I was captivated by what was happening on the screen, despite the relatively little action in the film, and was kept in suspense from the opening scenes until the finale almost two hours later.  Unfortunately, I think the ending is one of the stupidest that I have ever seen, it just doesn't make any scientific sense at all!!!  And the more I think about it and talk about it with other people who saw it, the more problems with this ending surface.  I won't say what that ending is, but in my opinion it was enough to demote this movie from an easy 10 down to an 8, maybe a 7.  However, in all other aspects, it is the best movie I have seen so far this year.  The acting is very good, although I thought that Mel Gibson was a little stiff throughout the film, the direction is superb, the score is perfect, and except for a few cheesy lines, which seem mandatory in all movies these days, the writing is excellent.",Signs

The movie is tediously slow. There are however more fake scares than a ""Friday the Thirteenth"" movie, a tired ploy when overdone, as here. The screams at those by my fellow theatergoers, however, were the only things keeping me awake through this ""thriller"".

Aliens travel hundreds or thousands parsecs in space and invade Earth naked (which as everybody says is 80% covered by water unbearable for them)??

1090,sthorson,"Signs should be renamed ""sins""; sins against good film making.",2,16 August 2002,"Signs was dreary, dark and dull and with few surprises.  Clues were so broadly drawn and overdone that the viewer couldn't help but know what was going to happen.  And,when it did happen, they knew what was going to be done about it.  And, what is this 2002 movie cliche about someone forgetting to have their life-saving medication in their possession before they lock themselves in a small, dark room to avoid attackers?If you had found an alien invader locked and defenseless in someone's pantry, wouldn't you alert the local law enforcement agency?  Or, tell someone?  Mel Gibson didn't.  And, as far as Mel Gibson goes, when I told my husband we were going to see Signs, starring Mel Gibson.  His comment was, ""I hope he doesn't cry"".  Well, he cried.  And I cried too, at how bad this movie was after I had ""heard"" others say how good it was.
Signs was good for a laugh or two.  How about when they nailed a few thin boards from the inside of a room across a doorway whose door opens out from the room?  So, the invaders can open the door toward themselves and crawl through the 2 foot gaps?  Who let that gaff go undetected?  And, how and why did the invaders carve out elaborate moon, star, and sun cut-outs on one of the boarded up windows?  Just for good photographic effects?  Don't bother going to this movie; wait for it to come on TV where you don't expect very good movies;  you won't be disappointed.  This is NOT a very good movie.",Signs

1094,Snoopy3334333,this will scare the socks off your feet!,10,8 August 2002,"my official review: (no spoilers)""All Signs Are Good""Signs is aptly titled, not only because of what the movie itself deals with, but also, because it hints at things to come from the brilliant M. Night Shyamalan...It starts off setting up the story we see in the previews: there's crop circles appearing everywhere...what are they, and whose making them? As the story progresses, we find out, as we all know, that these are indeed alien creations. We then are left to wonder and figure out, ""why are they doing this?"". This proves to be the underlying question of the movie. Along the way, we experience several jumps and jolts (actually, more like half a dozen) mixed in with refreshing bits of witty humor, an unexpected yet wonderful and ingenious addition to the film. As the plot continues to unfold and reach to deeper depths, we learn the circumstances of the death of Graham's wife, and hence, why he has turned against his once embraced God. There is one particularly striking speech by Hess about types of people that really brings this aspect to heart. At a point in the movie, we finally see the real plot emerge: can this family stick together and make it through, even in spite of the desperate times?The technical aspects of the movie are outstanding. The acting is top notch, and perhaps even award-worthy for Joaquin Phoenix. The many quirks and subplots of the film provide superb foreshadowing for the rest to come. Everything involved with the movie is beautiful, and were this film to be properly recognized by the academy, I feel it would receive nominations for cinematography, supporting actor (Phoenix), editing, sound, score, screenplay, and directing, and maybe even best picture. Even if one does not find the story to be involving and compelling as I did, they surely must enjoy the movie for it's technical brilliance.The movie as a whole feels like a superbly crafted mix between a great summer thriller and a moving family drama. Expectations are met, and to some points, exceeded by this film. Others have commented about the story's ending being a letdown, but to me, it was fitting to the real meaning of the movie. Sure, certain aspects of the film are cheesy, such as the some of the visuals and the few plot holes, but it's all in good fun, so my reccomendation is this: see this film, not for a twist ending that won't be there when the time comes, but for a thrilling, taut, and engaging movie-going experience of a lifetime.9.4 out of 10",Signs
1095,dagreatestmceva,Wasnt as good as it was hyped up to be...... (SPOILERS),1,7 August 2002,"This film was disappointing. Firstly, the Americans hyped it up to be such a great film and absolutely scary, WHICH I KNEW FOR A FACT WAS RUBBISH seen as the Americans couldnt even make horror films if their lives depended on it...'scary' to them is like someone dropping a bottle on to the floor and the sound created is enough to send chills down their spine! I was amazed at how many of the audience in the cinema in New York (where i am on holiday) screamed every time they saw something remotely unusual..such as an alien hand suddenly grabbing someone..whereas in England, the audience would have remained quiet and said: ""Ok....where is the scary bit??""Secondly, the ending was much too short and a greater effect would have been to show more of the reflection of the alien being on the television screen and a view from behind it before showing a brief glimpse of it right at the very end rather than just to show its whole face and body for a few minutes and spoil it. Shamyalan had built up the suspense and made us aware of the beings' presence throughout the movie, so why spoil it all at the end?
Thirdly, the movie on the whole is very short and it seemed that the only good scenes were at the very end of the film. I read somewhere that you shouldnt go alone to watch this film..well thats right...you should bring all your friends with you to have GOOD laugh at how the Americans think a 'scary, alien' film should be.I AM very sure that if this film was released in England with the same director and crew, it would have been an absolute flop because the Americans, as usual, think their movies are the best when in actual fact they are mainly rubbish and not even scary, i.e. Mothman Prophecies, Signs and the worst of all: Minority Report. A British director would have done a MUCH better job of it. But Shamylan does write his movies well, i have to admit. Shame he couldnt direct it well. i give it a not-so-scary 5/10.",Signs

1097,pad_rag,Troublesome aspects of Signs,8,5 August 2002,"Signs has sterling performances, Joaquim Phoenix's being my favorite.  Mel Gibson is refreshingly subdued, and when he vamooses on seeing an alien's tail (possibly), it is unlike anything you have seen from Mel.  The movie does not have surprises like in Shyamalan's previous movies, and is a welcome change.  Unbreakable's ending seemed contrived.Signs has wonderful camera work, and a great musical score.  The movie is eerie, funny, and moving.  Signs is about how normal people would behave when aliens came to earth.  Not how Will Smith would, based on Jeff Goldblum's advice.  The movie is disturbing.It is troublesome nevertheless.  Staying away from special effects altogether is not a sign of greatness in the young Indian director.  I mean, a movie must be different from a play in some way.  Signs isn't.  I'd still like to see how Shyamalan uses special effects, if he is to be compared to Spielberg.  I had the same problem with Unbreakable: the train shook, but we did not see it crash.  How would Shyamalan make it look different on screen? That's my poser.My feeling is Shyamalan either doesn't have the ability to show these effects, or wants to save money.  The trouble is his films are becoming blockbusters in spite of a lack of effects.  Signs has more scope, and I felt it wanting.  It is very well for critics to say that it is what you don't see that's scary.  Spielberg did something similar in Jaws, but the final showdown with the shark looks frightening on the screen even today. The creature in Signs was more comical than anything else.PS.  I am an Indian, and a die-hard Shyamalan addict. I hope he will listen.",Signs

I won't go into detail of the story (go see it now if you can!!) but it was funny and frightening and sad and shocking and all the things a good film of its genre should be. Gibson was at his best in this and young Culkin and Breslin gave chilling performances. Phoenix has got another notch on his belt and proved yet again that in front of the camera he can be anyone, do anything.The beauty of this film is that it's conceivable, not like the futuristic Matrix, Signs is a story that could happen today and that is what's so terrifying. The plot is full of twists and is perfectly woven; I cannot wait to see another film by Shyamalan.Swing away, Merrill.",Signs
1099,veridical,Not a shred of originality here,3,12 August 2002,"Although the director makes a good attempt to scare the heck out us with classic ""halloween"" elements - strange sounds, movement in the cornfield, things that go bump in the night, and creepy aliens, the film lacks theme and focus, and what results is goofy monster flick.  The increasing silliness amongst the characters is a bad sign itself, as if the actors themselves need some comic relief from their own professional descent. The alien/monster genre elements offer nothing new, seen a thousand times on the X-files, with a happy ending even less tantalizing but expected.  The ""spielburgesque"" camera work and character development does little more than introduce a treacly family adrift in rural life. I went in to the film hoping to be mesmerized by the crop circle phenomenon, but the crop circles were little more than a prop to suck you in.  We learn nothing more than we already knew, and nothing at all about their truly fascinating history in the England, Europe, and other parts of the world. The screen writing is sloppily, and apparently hurriedly, written.  At one point, the character of Merrill Hess, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is developed with a story that he was recognized as hitting the longest home run in school history, by swinging hard and striking out a lot.  For anyone who knows anything about baseball, the longest hit has nothing to do with the hardest swing.  It's about years of practice connecting and coordinating complex muscle movements in the swing.  When you think about it, it sends the wrong message to our kids.  Even the messages in Signs ""strike out"".",Signs

Also, Mel Gibson is great, and so is t he gladiator guy. THe only bad thing I can say about this film, is the boy (Mel's ""son"") is damn annoying and is always nagging to the father.

1102,jivetalkingrobot,Hitchcock reborn,7,8 September 2002,"Whether it was his attempt, or not, M. Night Shalaman has recreated Alfred Hitchcock's style, and in essence, made it his own.Structurally, there aren't many differences between this, and a film like Psycho.  The opening credits follow Hitchcock's style of very distinctive music while showing all those associated with the film.  As well, Shalaman's cameo performance in the film, although larger than most of Hitchcock's roles, show the influence that he had on him.  Not to mention, the pure psychological aspect of the film's suspense.  Much of the action is either implied, off screen, or very, very brief, keeping the audience guessing at what is behind the tension, etc.The difference between the two, however, is the brilliance of the story itself.  The dual purpose of the title itself, ""signs,"" is brilliant in its own right.  Firstly, the actual signs, directing extra terrestrial life to various places on the planet, as well as the signs that Mel Gibson is recieving from God, to renew his faith.This outing by Shalaman is comepletely different from his previous exploits, and some may be disappointed with the absence of such a bizarre twist that exist in his previous films.  However, the mere suspense alone, makes this film worthwhile, and worth anyone's $13.50, or however much it costs in your neck of the woods.",Signs
1103,kuypy,You will gasp and jump with fright!,10,5 September 2002,"Signs is a great movie reminiscent of the old way of making a movie, built on suspense, great acting and the single most significant ingredient - FEAR. No computer graphics, no high tech weaponry, no non stop action.  Just the slow building and continual hold of fear, and tension through out the entire movie.The formula of Signs relies on the simple fact; that we as individuals fear the unknown.The story is about a farming family who are  dealing with the fairly fresh death of a family member. Gibson's Character, Graham ""father"" Hess has to deal with his own grief, let alone his children's.  One morning, he finds the beginning of a Crop Circle, and thus the weirdness and installation of fear begins.Is it Aliens, the local mischief makers or something else entirely?A lot of the movie we go through a cat and mouse approach. You can hear the sounds of whatever is ""out there"", but you very rarely see what it is, as a whole.  In one great scene, the Hess family are trapped in their boarded up house. The camera pans, as if our eyes, looking at the areas where we hear the movements of what is outside the house.  And we know there is no where for these people to go, and no one can help them.  They are a every day family, there are no weapons for them to use for protection.  All they have is each other.The suspense of Signs works because the story is realistic enough to relate to. All the emotions of fear, panic and the instinct to survive, the family go through in their secluded location, is to be expected of anyone in the same circumstance.Mel Gibson is brilliant as the grieving father, once a priest, as he questions his faith.  Signs would have to be the best movie I have ever seen Mel Gibson in and I've seen most of his movies!Signs is one of the best suspense movies of recent years.  If you decided to see only one movie this year, make it this one.  You will not be disappointed.  You'll be scared.",Signs
1104,GunZblaZin,A misunderstood Masterpiece.,10,28 October 2002,"Spoiler Alert!! People who didn't like it are definitely not getting it. But that is totally understandable. Signs is a highly symbolic movie.People don't ""get it"" because North Americans are not used to heavy symbolism in film. The symbolism gives it a ""dream-like"" quality that is confusing to some. Symbolism is also ""alien"" to the genre of science fiction.From ""The World Treasury of Science Fiction"" ""So much science fiction was... unreal on one hand, and so concerned with the gritty realities of science and technology on the other, that a majority of educated readers had no interest in learning how to read the genre, a practice easily picked up by children and teenagers - by taking every detail literally at first, until given other direction by the text. This is just the reverse of the way we approach the prose literature...""Science fiction is a product of the post-modern materialist world. A world in which there is no God, and only technology can save us from the random dangers of the Universe. This is precisely the ideology that the filmmaker is against! He even pokes fun at the sci-fi fans with ""Dr Biimbo"" and the brother's theory on ""the nerds"".Far from being a science fiction film that needs to conform to the expectations of the genre, Signs is actually out right ""anti-science fiction"". It doesn't make scientific sense on purpose (how could aliens that melt in water walk around in earths atmosphere, which contains high quantities of water, without environmental suits?), because it's not about science. It's about faith. It's about symbolism.... signs...Most science fiction is written as ""what would aliens really be like?"" ""What is the most realistic alien invasion scenario I can come up with?"" Signs isn't like that. In Signs, the aliens are just symbols. The invasion is a symbol. The house is a symbol. The signs are a symbol.So for all the atheist sci-fi fans who didn't ""get"" the symbolism, here it is put very simply:""when you don't have faith, you are alone in the world. Isolated and vulnerable to the soulless whims of nature. You are like a boy with asthma trapped in the basement of a boarded up house in the middle of nowhere surrounded by invading aliens.""That's it. Get it now?This is one of the best films I have seen... until the last five minutes. It has some flaws, but what great work of art doesn't have a few flaws somewhere?",Signs
1105,GunZblaZin,Where Shyamalan can do no wrong...,10,4 November 2002,"Harry's review of SIGNS.When Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross reinvented the art of superhero comics with their MARVELS, something rather profound happened to me. For the first time in my life I looked at superheroes from the angle of imagining what it would be like to live in a world where the events that I've seen portrayed in issue after issue of a thousand comics would be thought of by the people living in that world that were. like me. normal and not super at all.It wasn't about the 'hero' shots anymore, where we stay on their plane of existence, but from the point of view of that guy down below looking up at gods, demigods and beings beyond imagination doing things one could not believe. It made me reflect upon fiction as though it were part of my world, it made me reexamine my own take on the medium that I had given so much of my active thought processes over to, and made me think. What if it were real? Then with UNBREAKABLE - M. Night did something that was even more earth-shattering for my thought processes about comic books and super-heroes. What if you've been a super-hero all along, that your own marginal expectations and evaluation of your own abilities have kept you from discovering what you were truly capable of. What if you discovered you were a superhuman, not in the MARVEL UNIVERSE not in the D.C. UNIVERSE or any of those others... But what if you were a superhuman in our world... for real.It is that WHAT IF quality that I love, cherish and adore about M Night Shyamalan.When we were younger and Steven Spielberg could literally do no wrong, I believed in the magic he used to transport me. He took people living in the suburbs, blue-collar types and took them on adventures you couldn't imagine. JAWS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T. were perhaps the most astonishing. The films he produced like POLTERGEIST, BACK TO THE FUTURE, GREMLINS and YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES captivated me with that same. this could be YOUR adventure quality. Even Steven's television show I grew up with. AMAZING STORIES, all of his classic period work was about WHAT IF. From MUMMY DADDY to GHOST TRAIN to THE MISSION to that Alamo episode to the Sid Caesar magician bloke episode. The ideas that flowed from Steven's head back then. all those STORY BY credits he used to have. It is just sad to see that well dry up. Now he's an adaptation boy. Finding other people's stories to tell, and really I miss his own. Perhaps he has no more stories to tell personally. If so, I'm glad that folks like M. Night Shyamalan and Richard Kelly and Charlie Kaufman are around to give the stories that are told on film that personal touch I miss from Steven's films today.
For M. Night's grasp of the WHAT IF, I can't help but reflect upon a screening of DESTROY ALL MONSTERS at a Quentin Tarantino Film Festival, where he went into an amazing introduction in regards to the TOHO Universe, where he wished he could make a GODZILLA film that wasn't about the military trying to get Godzilla out of the town, but rather a Woody Allen type of movie set in the Toho Universe Tokyo where. from time to time 300 Ft Tall Monsters could come and destroy everything you know and care about. How these creatures would come to have quasi-religious cults that would worship them, that you would have basic drills just like EARTHQUAKE scares and TORNADO warnings. The Giant Monster Updates on TV and Radio. How the whole of society would be conditioned to deal with the horror in the most normal and accepting manner there could be. Much like the people in George Pal's TIME MACHINE did in regards to Nuclear War. Where it was simply a way of life that was adapted to.There's something wonderful about treating the incredible, in all seriousness, as though it is something that happens in our world and it is no longer a work of fiction and you. your neighbor. your pastors and doctors and law enforcement types have to deal with. FOR REAL. And play it serious, with everything having the weight of reality behind it. That this, for better or worse, is happening in our world, where people die, people get sick and it doesn't necessarily work out for the best. OH. And life will never be the same for anyone after this point.SIGNS is our story about THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. It isn't about the world fighting the aliens and repelling the invaders ala WAR OF THE WORLDS, MARS ATTACKS! or INDEPENDENCE DAY. This is your story. The story of the little family that is caught up in this. They are not the key to it all. They don't discover something profound that drives the aliens away. They are simply one of the millions of stories that would take place, the night the aliens came.This would be like telling the story of Moses from the point of view of some anonymous stone carver that didn't understand why flaming hail was falling from the sky, where the various plagues were coming from, but by the time the Angel of Death rumors start, you better believe he's painting lambs blood over his door, because he's seen *beep* that made him really believe.See, to a large degree that's what M. Night is doing. He's making movies about characters that don't believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny or Harvey, and he's making them believe.As an audience member, I find it my duty to simply let him take me with him on these stories. Just giving myself over to Shyamalan and letting the story take me wherever it may take me.All I really knew about SIGNS was that there were Crop Circles and I think Aliens actually appear in the film. I think. I knew that Mel Gibson played a preacher that didn't believe anymore, that he had a couple of kids and that Joaquin Phoenix played some sort of relative.That's the perfect way to go into this film, because M. Night, Tak Fujimoto, the actors, James Newton Howard and Barbara Tulliver are going to take you on an experience. And when it is all wrapped up at the end, well I just want to see it again. Not for any other reason than to watch possibly the most elegant old school filmmaker working today, tell a story to perfection. Knowing exactly when he wants you to know something, when to hand you a piece of information, what to put in front of our eyes, while giving our ears something else to do. This is just perfect filmmaking for me. It really just feels perfect.
Everything exactly the way I love it. There are some tiny things that might bother some folks, because they feel that Shyamalan is talking down to his audience, but I disagree. That moment towards the end of the film isn't about the 'audience' realizing something, but for a character in the film. It is about that character's blink thought - his OX-BOW INCIDENT reflection at the end of all things. Had we not seen his thoughts, for me, the moment would have lost its emotional resonance. It would have simply been. cute. As played, I felt it was perfect. It isn't a huge twist, just a moment of realization, not unlike Chazz Palminteri's character in THE USUAL SUSPECTS.except more subtle and a helluvalot less 'earth-shattering'. Like I said, the scene in question, you'll know it when you see it, isn't about you realizing it, it is about that character realizing it. About it registering for him. Then - it is time to move forward, because that character can finally move forward with what he needs to do. No matter, I loved this scene.Watching this trilogy of films from M. Night has been bliss. A trilogy about believing in the impossible. About dealing with the impossible. About living through the impossible. What a wonderful place to explore.He's done it with razor sharp humor, built out of the situations that the characters find themselves in. For example. the Baby monitor moment in the family car. how that scene evolves, where that scene goes, what that scene does. It feels organic, real and creepy as all hell. There are things to laugh at. nervously and hilariously. but it is grounded in reality.The dog scenes are simple and utter perfection. Just hair on the back of the neck, clicked heels and standing at attention wonderful. Here there is no place for humor, and he knows it. It is so nice to see a filmmaker know exactly when to release tension and when to keep the lid on.The way the television is used, the baby monitor, light, darkness, sounds - specifically the sound in a digitally wonderful surround sound auditorium. BTW - Yes, we're all aware that this film is out there in the digital pirate world, if you *beep* download and watch it this way for the first time. with only a couple of days left. DON'T DO THAT! This is an audience film. The nervous teetering laughter - the genuine shrieks of terror - the applause caused from the delight. This is a film that you let yourself get caught up in the minute to minute reality of the characters on screen and I couldn't help but react emotionally at every turn.The way he directs this family. The relationships between Father and Son. Brother and Sister. Father and daughter. Uncles and nephew and niece. Priest and community. Sheriff and Priest. Killer and Survivor. These relationships are so honestly told. So genuinely affecting and real that I was captivated and entranced. These are real relationships. Real affection, anger, frustration, delight and joy. Real fear. Real scares. Real nerves.
The skill and craftsmanship involved in this film is breathtaking. You feel a scene coming that you've seen in a dozen other films, at least, and he unfolds it in a way you've never seen before. When presented with choices he chooses the path less followed. It is very odd seeing this film after FULL FRONTAL, because Soderbergh was playing with some of the same ideas, to unfold a scene in a less obvious way, but when he did it, it felt like he was doing it, whereas here. for me, M. Night's story telling is so consistently compelling and smart that it feels one hundred percent natural. He turns the soil, plants the seed, waters and fertilizes it, watches it grow and harvests the resulting fruit. Oh. and I chowed down like the happy hippo that I am.I don't feel him winking at me during the film. I don't get any smugness or artificiality from his stories. Instead I feel that I've been given a log to sit on, a fire to watch and a story to hear. It feels intimate, genuine and wonderful.M. Night has everything that I once loved to death about Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. He consummately is telling stories about real people in extraordinary situations. These people make choices that I can imagine making. I celebrate in their victories, mourn their losses and retell their stories. After the film, for the first time in a long time, I went out to dinner with the local AICNers that were in attendance and we talked about the film. We had a dinner, we sat around that table and we talked about what we loved, our dreams about more from M. Night and what is to come from him. I've heard rumors that he is interested in doing the JOHN CARTER OF MARS film at Paramount, and I can't even imagine what that would look like. Sort of like imagining what Baz Luhrmann's ALEXANDER THE GREAT project is going to look like. Again. can you imagine?Right now, M. Night is the one filmmaker, above all others, that I want to just transport me. Whom I absolutely trust to tell me a story exactly the way I would dream of having it told to me. Is he the best director working in films today? I think such ideas are ludicrous, that you can place one above all others, but for my sensibilities, my tastes, my way of watching films. Shyamalan is where Spielberg used to be for me. His stories are less IN YOUR FACE with the effects and the scores that he's getting out of James Newton Howard are far more Miklós Rózsa and Bernard Herrmann than they are John Williams. In the end though, for a boy that was brought up on Spielberg, the grown-up version of that boy loves Shyamalan and hopes that the well from which he is pouring from never goes dry.",Signs
1106,GunZblaZin,Can't wait to see what Shyamalan has for next,10,23 November 2002,"Don't go into M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" expecting a conventional sci-fi thriller. ""Signs"" involves circular formations in a farmer's crops that might be the work of aliens. It's scary and suspenseful. But it's not intended as a jolt-a-minute terror-fest, and it's not an ""Independence Day""-kind of action-packed man-vs.-aliens war movie. It's as much a drama about faith as a thriller. Mel Gibson, in one of his best performances, plays Graham Hess, a former minister who turned his back on religion after his wife's death in an accident. He lives a quiet life on a farm 45 miles outside of Philadelphia with his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin). Then things start getting weird. Graham discovers circular patterns and lines cut perfectly into his crops. He and his brother first suspect pranksters. They're wrong. When the truth is revealed, the film's characters must face the distinct possibility that they're about to die. ""Signs"" is about how they react and what they choose to believe. Is life a random series of events? Or does everything have a purpose, with no coincidences? Writer-director Shyamalan boldly takes a stand here, and the result is a series of moving sequences, including a finale that, if it hits you as it did me, will take your breath away. As he did with the acclaimed ""The Sixth Sense"" and the underappreciated ""Unbreakable,"" Shyamalan shows in ""Signs"" that he's a writer who knows how to weave an intricately constructed tale and build to a richly satisfying conclusion, and that he's a sensitive, assured director with a talent for character development and blending humor and tragedy, the supernatural and everyday life. He also knows how to tell a story visually and with economy. Just watch the opening sequence. We see a photo in Graham's bedroom that indicates he's been married; we see him wake up alone in a single bed; he walks into a hallway and there are kid's drawings on a bedroom door; a wall shows a mark where a cross once hung. All of these shots tell us something, without a word spoken. Shyamalan also is a good actor. In ""Signs"" he's excellent as the guilt-stricken man who accidentally killed Graham's wife.
That's just one of many fine performances in the film. Gibson is heartbreaking as a man reeling from his wife's death. Phoenix, taking a break from the more offbeat characters he's often played (such as the villainous emperor in ""Gladiator""), gives an impressively natural (and often funny) portrayal as the brother. The kids are believable. And Tony Award-winner Cherry Jones is memorable as a compassionate local police officer. ""Signs"" is a great movie. Can't wait to see what Shyamalan comes up with next.",Signs
1107,vchic,Plot holes galore,6,1 November 2002,"The plot holes are so amazing in this film that I was stunned it even made it to the big screen without someone in production going ""errr wait a minute..."".  Sure there were some scenes of suspense but that's it.  The rest is poor plot and I regret not waiting for this one to come out on tv so I could have saved my money.  Spoilers:  so the assumption is that the aliens are hostile, want to harvest humans and take over the earth. Except they have a wee problem: they don't mix well with water.  Let's see, how much of the Earth is water?  How much of the human body is water?  How much rainfall do we get?  And haven't these aliens ever heard of wet weather gear?  If you do watch this, make up some kind of drinking game in advance where you take a big swig every time you notice a major plot hole.  I guarantee you'll be riproaring drunk by the end of the film.",Signs
1108,morgan_patterson,What did I just watch?,5,30 January 2003,"I thought that this story had some serious potential, but when I watched it I soon learned that  I was sadly mistaken.  The whole alien thing was not explained well at all and there was virtually no chance for character introduction and development (because of the lack of them).  I knew what the aliens were doing, but never actually saw anything, so the ""impact"" of the situation was extremely dulled (for me).  I did, however, give the film a 5.0 and I will tell you why.  I liked how they did the flashbacks to the accident, therefore explaining two of the seven main characters in the film. Anyone could have done this film and easily substituted the aliens with something else.  I felt that the aliens served little purpose in this film.",Signs
1109,AaronBilawchuk,Best alien movie ever that's not about aliens...,8,13 March 2003,"After the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and now Signs, I certainly hope we see something new from M. Night Shyamalan very soon.  He is already a recognized and marketable name as a director.  I can't help but liken him to Alfred Hitchcock, though he is nowhere near and will likely never achieve that bar set by Hitchcock.  Even the music and his cameo appearances in his films suggest Hitchcock.I honestly didn't know what to expect going into this one.  I knew it would be creepy.  I wanted a thriller.  I got way more than I expected.People looking for another 'Independence Day' or 'Alien' need not apply. You won't see much of the aliens in this movie.  But, as it turns out, this movie isn't about aliens at all.  It's about faith.  I have NEVER seen the subject of faith presented in such a novel and provoking way.  Mel Gibson needs to take on more roles like this one, because here he truly shines. For that matter, the entire cast does a remarkable job, notably Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin.This movie had its scares, but at the same time it had some absolutely hilarious moments.  This movie has found the balance between horror and comedy that clicks just so perfectly.Don't just ask someone to tell you what happens.  If you're at all interested, see this movie.  Thought provoking, funny, scary, and entertaining, this is the best of Shyamalan's work to date.  I eagerly await announcement of his next movie, and hope it continues his trend of quality and Hitchcockian suspense.",Signs
1110,jordan-trydal,Signs,8,23 March 2003,"I found this movie to be suspenseful and creative.  You don't see too many movies that have the world going to end by an attack by aliens and the Americans not doing any thing about it.  They should have called up Will Smith to go jump in a space ship and blow the mother ship up.  That seems realistic enough.  That was the best when they had some country, other than the U.S figure out a way of killing the aliens.  I also thought it was a good idea not to show the aliens that much.  (This isn't an action/horror movie!)  We don't need to see all the guts and blood of the aliens, if they show too much of them it takes away the suspense of the whole movie, and wondering if they are actually for real or a big Hoax.  And another thing is the aliens were not all that impressive in the first place; I don't think you needed to see much more of them.  At least you know where they spent their budget on (Mel Gibson), and not on special effects.  Over all I rate this movie an 8/10.",Signs
1111,bcocheran,Mostly Great (Possible Spoilers),9,23 February 2003,"This was a very interesting film.  It was well worth the viewing although I am still unsure how I feel overall concerning the picture.  Most of the film is brilliant and I would recommend it highly.  The things I was most disappointed in were: (1). The ending is a little shoddy. (2) The entire theme of the movie is unpleasant from the beginning with no view of life as normal before things begin to fall apart. (3) The struggle of faith in Graham Hess's (Mel Gibson) life is left almost totally unresolved (or it is brushed over to an undramatic conclusion). (4) The end of life glimpse of the future from Colleen Hess (Patricia Kalember)seemed somewhat fake/staged. Again, noted I rated the movie a 9.  I thought the movie was great and am still uncertain how much the above mentioned short comings effected the my overall view of the movie.  I thought it was a great movie with a few shortfalls.  Would highly recommend to sci-fi lovers.",Signs
1112,holerj,dark comedy?,5,22 February 2003,"Shyamalan's trademark seems to be clichéd paranormal tales. The filmmaking is not clichéd but the ideas are. In Sixth Sense, about 10 or 15 minutes from the end, I was thinking ""why was everyone talking about this film?"" then with a simple twist it gives you something to think and talk about. People told me that they thought Sixth Sense was very scary. This is my problem - I don't find films scary anymore. I seemed to have reached the age, or state of mind, where I don't scare easily, especially by films with B movie ghosts or aliens. It didn't help that I watched Signs at home with my wife and kids but I saw Sixth Sense at the cinema and neither raised any hairs on my neck. I put this down to the fact that I don't believe in the spiritual or paranormal. In fact, stealing a line from the movie, I think that events just happen, not that they are signs. If you believe that everything is ultimately explainable (or random) then there is less of an unknown to be scared of.So, what you get out of this film will depend on your beliefs and whether you like scary movies. If you don't find it scary there is not going to be a lot left to entertain you. On the plus side there are a few laughs - more than you would expect but the Science Fiction is corny (no pun intended!) and implausible. Perhaps it is best to approach Signs as a dark comedy.So, what you get out of this film will depend on your beliefs and whether you like scary movies.

1113,AlbinoAlbedo,Disgusting waste of celluloid and your time,2,10 July 2013,"I feel kind of bad for M. Night Shyamalan. The Sixth Sense, one of the best films of the 90's and one of the best plot twists of all time, ultimately sucked all the talent, potential and genius out of Shyamalan and left him as a stupid, egotistic moron who wouldn't know a plot if it was injected directly into his skull. And this is one of his worst films by far.The only reason I have not given this film a 1/10 is because at least Shyamalan films have half-decent cinematography and he obviously puts a lot of effort into making his films look good. That's where the praise finishes. ALL the actors did a horrible job. Even Gibson's performance is flat and boring. Phoenix does a stereotypical white American jock hero sort of act and fails to give off any emotion. The actors who play the kids are also terrible, they did nothing but irritate me and their acting was bland and talentless. And of course Shyamalan sticks his ugly mug in for several scenes and tries to stammer out fancy sounding lines in an obvious attempt to boost his ego.The worst parts of this train-wreck are the plot holes. Here we have aliens that can build spacecraft and travel billions of miles across the universe... and can't open a pantry door (and what does Mel do upon stumbling across this extra-terrestrial threat? Call the police? No, he goes home and acts like nothing happens, idiot). These aliens, to whom water is like a highly corrosive acid, choose to invade a planet that is mostly water, while naked, running around in air that's full of moisture, sprinting through cornfields that would be covered in water droplets in the morning, not taking into account things like rain, not bringing any tools, medical equipment, weapons or armor, and on top of all that, feeding on humans who are about 80% water. It's so STUPID it hurts. And their top secret communications? You can pick those up on a baby monitor. Please. Also, don't keep your son's life saving medication handy- he'll never need it.That's not the only problem. This film bills itself as a science fiction thriller, but it's a thinly disguised Christian ""regaining-of-faith"" flick. Mel looses his faith after his wife is killed by a rouge driver, then he regains it again after he realizes her death rattle was a warning from God to help him defeat the aliens. So what does Mel say? He basically says ""Thanks God"", when he should have been questioning why God made him loose faith and then gave it back to him, only while KILLING his wife in the process! Come on! What a waste of God's time, Mel's time, our time, and some innocent person died for no reason because Mel ended right back at point A! This entire film disgusts me and insults the intelligence of reasonable people everywhere. In the end, I was hoping some of the Hess family would die because they irritated me so much. I almost got my hopes up when that brat started having a respiratory attack but then my hopes were quickly crushed. In the end, the message is ""God will make you loose your faith, kill your loved ones, and then give your faith back"". Good job Shyamalan, your writing and directing talents (but not your acting talents- your cameos suck) never cease to amaze me. This man should be BANNED from making movies.2/10",Signs

Independence Day kind of film.I beg to differ.It seems to me that the two most important things in life are FAITH and FAMILY and not in that order and this film explores them both beautifully.Faith is important in anything one does,in life ,in work,in god ,in the one you love,in your books ..and need I say about ones Family(sure we might not totally 'love' some of them).ONE THING YOU SHOULDNT DO:please dont take this movie at face value...that is dont expect a movie about aliens and please dont expect a lesson in science from the movie.what the films about?the film center around one family(meaning :no SUBPLOTS )whose head is A MINISTER (played brilliantly by Mel Gibson),he loses his wife in a horrible car accident and also as a result loses his trust and belief in god.His family includes his brother(Joaquin Phoenix...emperor in GLADIATOR),his daughter and son(two of the cutest kids you can hope to find) all characters portrayed with a great deal of emotion.The family is taken through a emotional roller coaster as a result of the crop circles and the notion of aliens invading the planet.THE most amazing part of the movie????In such a situation the entire family normally looks up to the head (in this case MEL GIBSON),instead they find that he is cracking under pressure and the thought that he could lose his entire family.the ENDING?some of the people I know didnt enjoy the ending too much as they felt it was too superficial and not too dramatic,again I beg to differ.I am not gonna give it away But if you are gonna watch the film,my advice purely is,do not take it as it comes,think about it.If the movie does not make you ask yourself some basic questions about god or faith ;then it does mean that the desired effect which shyamalan had hoped to bring through hasnt worked.As for the coincidences part,it is left to each one of us to take in our own way",Signs

While I was watching it I kept on thinking ""What's going to happen next?"", in fact the movie is made in a way that keeps on making you curious and wonder what will happen next, just like it happened to me. I really appreciated the way the director put everything together, for example the lighting, the way the situations were shown and how every little detail might be really important for the story. The two little kids were really important characters in the movie, they help you see it more from a younger prospective, and their acting was really professional. The father and the brother help you see the movie from an older person's point of view and also helps you see how adults would react in a situation like this one. I really liked the fact that after all this is a family movie , and by that I mean that there is not one main character but the main character is the entire family.

1121,bsoft-3,Breaks movie rule #1,1,30 July 2007,"Signs breaks movie rule #1: don't insult your audience.Fantasy is great. Implausible is good. Outlandish is acceptable.Signs is none of the three. It somehow manages to find its way into a fourth category - one that is so absolutely ridiculous that we question whether the writers were even awake.It's stupid that Jeff Goldblum uploads a computer virus to the alien mainframe. It's stupid that viruses kill aliens who probably wouldn't have DNA at all.But, you know what? Audiences aren't computer scientists (I am), and they don't know jack about how viruses (real or computer!) work. We accept that writers don't have technical knowledge and that they usually don't get it right (though we applaud them when they do).Signs, on the other hand, is an entirely different matter.Everyone who sees this movie knows how common water is on Earth. It comes out of the tap, falls from the sky, and covers 70% of the planet. It's in rivers, lakes, and in every living thing on our planet. Kids play with blasters designed to shoot it and balloons designed to hold it. We have pools of it to swim in. It's sold in bottles in every food store, convenience store, drugstore, and pretty much any other kind of store you can think of.So, considering that you could hardly choose something more universal, WHY would the writers of Signs decide to make the aliens vulnerable to water? They know how universal it is. They know how absolutely ABSURD such a plot point is, and they know that their audience will know it.Yet they proceeded anyway. Perhaps they were trying to push the limits of what their audience would accept. Perhaps this is some kind of silly joke. But whatever the reason, their choice was not a lack of understanding. Their choice to make the aliens vulnerable to water was not a mistake and not an oversight. It was a deliberate choice.It's a slap in the face. A big ""screw you"" for trying to believe that this movie in any way represents any sort of reality. Not just the reality we live in, but any reality whatsoever. Movies don't have to be consistent with the world we live in, but they do have to be consistent with themselves.I am vocal about my distaste for movies that insult me. Flightplan sucks because it breaks the barrier of plausibility. But as bad as Flightplan is, Signs is 1000 times worse. From beginning to end, this movie just doesn't fit together.Signs doesn't break with plausibility to advance the plot. There is no tongue-in-cheek ""OK, this is absurd"" like Austin Powers or Spaceballs. It's not funny, it's not artsy, and it's not smart. Signs breaks with plausibility simply because the writers thought they could get away with it. I, like many others on IMDb, have responded with an empathetic ""NO"". You can't just jerk me around for your own amusement. Write a movie that holds together or I will go watch one of the numerous other pictures that do.",Signs

1123,von_s,"Disappointing, Derivative",2,10 August 2002,"As a big fan of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I had high expectations for Signs.  Unfortunately, not only did Signs fail to meet these expectations; it was also a very disappointing film, not nearly up to the high standards set by Shyamalan's previous work.Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Signs is its lack of originality. The brilliance of The Sixth Sense and, to a lesser extent, Unbreakable, was the creativity and fresh vision of a new filmmaker who was unencumbered by expectations or commercial pressures.Signs is almost purely derivative.  The directing devise of showing only glimpses of the invading aliens until the climatic scene is right out of Jaws (in which Stephen Spielberg delayed revealing the shark with much greater effect).  The theme of a man who's lost his faith due to a personal tragedy has been dealt with many times -- and with much more subtly and emotion -- than it is here.  The death of Gibson's wife (without giving away too many details) is immediately recognizable as a theft from an episode of Homicide.   And the idea of alien invaders has been seen many times, most recently in Independence Day.Another problem with Signs is the premise itself.  Unlike Independence Day, which had no pretensions to serious drama but developed great characters in the midst of exciting action, Signs takes itself very seriously.  Yet, it's hard to take seriously a bunch of aliens who are so utterly inept that a farmer can lock them in a room and sit in his car the driveway while they try figure a way out.  Despite having the technology to travel across the galaxy to kick some human butt, these aliens sure are stupid.Finally, the writing and direction are just not up to Shyamalan's past standards.  I found no depth or subtly to Gibson's performance--and I am usually a defender of his.  Joaquin Phoenix, who is supposed to be Gibson's dumb jock brother, plays the role with too much intelligence.  One minute he's telling a story of a woman puking at a party, the next he's speaking eloquently about the need for his brother to keep his faith.  Finally, Abilgail Breslin's brilliant performance as Gibson's daughter is overshadowed by a terrible performance by Rory Culkin as Gibson's son.  In Culkin's defense, Shyamalan's script hands him line after line that is just not believable for a child.  Nevertheless, Culkin is not convincing as a serious, sulking young boy.Despite some suspenseful scenes, I found this movie highly disappointing and, at times, almost laughable (particularly the climactic scene).  I hope this is not an indication that Shyamalan may suffer much the same fate as Quentin Tarentino, being unable to live up to his brilliant early work.",Signs
1124,Banter,A truly scary film,10,14 August 2002,"Signs follows a family in rural Pennsylvania as they deal with unexplained `crop-circles' in their cornfield and who or what, made them. It would be hard to say too much more about the plot without ruining the experience of seeing it for yourself. So I will simply say that this is one of scariest movies I have ever seen. But, as with M. Night Shyamalan's other movies, it's not necessarily what happens, so much as how it happens. And Signs is no exception.Throughout the entire movie Shyamalan keeps the tension high by using the music, the silence, and the camera angle, and every once in a while throwing in something scary, something to fuel the fear, effectively turning your imagination into the vehicle with which to scare you. He plays the audience like a piano. And does it very well. In one scene he has the audience feeling the deep emotional pain of Graham Hess, only to jump to a scene totally and perfectly terrifying. After the screams subside, we jump to a scene that makes us laugh.Another thing that makes Signs scarier is simply how believable it is. This is greatly achieved through incredible acting and character development. Mel Gibson turns in one of his best performances to date as `Father' Graham Hess, an ex-minister who's recently lost his wife, and is trying to hold all the pieces of his family together. He plays the part so well, after watching the movie for the first time I remarked that I had forgotten that Mel Gibson was even in the movie. In fact, all of the actors, even Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are so believable in their parts, I nearly forgot I was watching a movie at all.Signs is not your typical scary movie. It doesn't have in-your-face action and special affects. It's not a gore or violence fest. In fact, the plot really isn't that scary. What it is, is a story with deep characters with real feelings, and a subtle terror that creeps up on you, scares the crap out of you and won't let you go for days. I give this movie a perfect 10",Signs

1126,Alastair-11,Scariest film for years,10,13 September 2002,"Tonight I'm still in shock, after sitting through ""Signs"". This has to be the scariest film I've seen for years ! After a relatively ordinary opening, the film gradually builds to a genuinely terrifying climax.Based on the traditional principle that what you don't see is often far more scary than what you do the director masterfully wrings every last drop out of his material and ties up all the clues to produce one of the best films of the year.The whole of the relatively small cast is just excellent, and Mel Gibson has never been better. However, even he is acted off the screen by his young co-star Abigail Breslin.Tell all your friends to go and see this movie - just don't do it alone !",Signs
1127,Jabba359,An informed critique of the film,8,5 August 2002,"After reading the various comments left about this film, I can't help but wonder how all these people can think that they are so educated in film. While reading many of the reviews, I could only think, ""My, this person obviously has no idea about the film making process and what is good and what isn't.""  Since I am majoring in film directing and producing, I would like to offer my review (hopefully somewhat informed, but obviously not perfect) of this film.  First of all, it is a technically brilliant piece. Shyamalan's use of lighting and camera angles only serves to heighten the tension in certain scenes.  The whole idea behind having lots of dark space and shadows is to play off of our fear of the unknown.  If it resembles Hitchcock, all the more power to him.  It is about time that someone gets the difference between a scares and gore correct.  As for the story, many complain that it doesn't tie up all the loose ends and that it has a twist to it.  It is nice to see a non-predictable film that makes us actually use our cerebrum to try to figure out how the loose ends tie themselves up. Lastly, for those who trash on the performances, I found the acting to be superb. I think that the main problem is that people lazily expect everything to be served on a silver platter and that if something is genuinely good, they don't feel as intelligent and superior if they don't trash on it; by talking it down, they somehow think that it makes them look better and smarter.  So if you want to follow the advice of these people, then don't see it.  But if you want to see an incredibly well-made and thought-provoking film, then I can't recommend this movie too highly.",Signs
1128,douggold,Wow,10,11 August 2002,"At different times watching this fantastic film I recalled the impact of previous masterpieces. It often achieved the intense, unsettling horror of The Blair Witch Project. It achieved a tone of eerie solitude and helplessness that reminded me of the best the old Twilight Zone could dream up.

1131,Metaphor123,One of the greatest thrillers ever made...,10,6 February 2003,"M. Night Shyamalan broke through in one of the biggest ways with 'The Sixth Sense', a cleverly scripted, chillingly shot, superbly paced horror/thriller that, had it been the only film he ever made, would have assured the director a place in film history. His next film, the well-directed, but less engaging 'Unbreakable', was not quite what its predecessor was. And even though Shyamalan wrote a twist ending for 'Unbreakable', it lacked the punch of 'Sense.''Signs', on the other hand, is one of those rare things: a film that is practically flawless. Whether the film has a twist ending or not I will not reveal, but an unexpected denoument is not necessary for a film like this - a film that grips the audience in unrelenting dread without apology. It is rare indeed for a film-maker to succesfully manipulate a post-postmodern audience. Rarer still is a director who can do it so consistently, without cheating, without resorting to shock tactics. Also very worthy of mention is James Newton Howard's equally flawless score. Equal parts 'Psycho' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', Howard's main theme is played over the style of opening credits rarely seen nowadays. Shyamalan has been compared to Spielberg, but 'Signs' is closer to Hitchcock than anything else, and Howard is Shyamalan's Bernard Herrmann.Shyamalan has woven tales from remnants of pop culture - ghosts, comic books, crop circles. One can only wonder what poison tale he will tell next.",Signs
1132,PEter-185,Starts out great but ends up really bad!,1,2 September 2002,"Really I had high hopes for this movie, and it was so good for the first hour or so. It was real Hitchcock movie, but then the director shows you the object of terror. You actually see it walking down the street and close up in a house. And then the movie fell from a perfect 10 to a horrible 1! It lost all credibility and I was laughing through the last part of the movie. This is a shame because the director really has caught this ""there is something out there vibe"" it was really intense. But it ended up as a plain big budget b-movie after you actually saw the object of terror! Shame on you M. Night Shyamalan !!!",Signs
1133,Ascetic,Still reeling,10,5 August 2002,"*********Some mild plot point spoilers. I don't recommend reading this until you've seen the film. i.e., go see the film.************It's possible that, in long retrospect, ""Signs"" will appear to my memory to be a simplistic, one-trick B-movie thriller with a generous sapling-layer of faith arguments thrown in for good measure. If I feel that way I won't be alone.But I don't feel that way right now.Right now I'm looking over my shoulder. Right now I'm pondering how M. Night Shyamalan could maintain as direct a focus on the details of this film as he does. Right now I'm still reeling from the realness of the situation into which the film's characters are thrust.Right now I'm writing this review so that I can rejoin the real world in some way, and detach myself from the one I was so thoroughly woven into a few hours ago. So I can sleep well, mostly.Shyamalan is possibly the most brutally efficient director I have ever seen at work. Only Hitchcock kept a focus nearly this narrow, and it's sure that ""poor man's Hitchcock"" is a phrase that will dog Shyamalan for the rest of his days. Others have compared him to Kubrick for the drawn-out scenes filled only with the immediate focus or sometimes with nothing at all, leaving the viewer to fill in the gaps. But in nearly all Kubrick films I find myself urging the next scene to begin; with this film I found myself wondering what new thrill or revelation would walk into the scene. Not a second is wasted. And yes, there are the trappings of early Spielberg, the ""less is more"" of Jaws, where we're slowly introduced to our assailant one terrifying limb at a time.And as we work our way into the nature of the beast, we are also astonished with the strangeness of the main characters, each of which it seems have been cast with a specific thrill in mind. Both Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix have creeped us out in one way or another in previous films, and the child actors, far from being boilerplate screamers, are as different as night and day, Rory Culkin appearing helpless and insightful while Abigail Breslin is naive yet resolute as the unflappable Bo.Shyamalan's only misstep is casting himself in a substantial role in this film, where he seems a young child who has created a spectacular fantasy world and finds himself unable to play-act in it with nearly the skill that its complexity and intensity require.And even his deadpan performance serves to dish up yet another of the ample thrills in the film. While I was somewhat disappointed with the ending, that disappointment was the same I feel as I pull into the station of my favorite roller-coaster ride - sadness that there couldn't have been one more blinding bit of firework, but soberly aware that I probably couldn't have handled anymore.Give this film a spin and see if you can handle it.",Signs

Well, I was, to say the least, mildly dissapointed. From the opening credits that reminded me of a high school powerpoint presentation, this ""Sci-Fi Thriller"" had its work cut for.Mel Gibson seemed to have his abilities of an actor caged up, which in turn made him simply a name to slap onto the picture. Joaquin Phoenix proved to be the highlight of the picture by adding much needed humor to the story. The two kids were pretty stereotypical for the whole cornfield horror genre.
THE FOLLOWING COMPLAINTS INVOLVE SPOILERS. YOU'VE BEEN WARNEDSorry for the following rants, but it's the only way I can put them out. First off, the Appearance of Night is a standard in his movies, but his most recent character just doesn't fit into this world. When the Alien is revealed, the broad daylight turns the scene from a creepy first look into a Scooby Doo-like laugh fest. There was not enough outside views of the Alien invasion. The final face off was all out ridiculous. A Hostile Alien would not dance around for two hours threatening to harm a person, it would just go for it. Why in all places in the world does the Middle East figure to use Water to fight off the Aliens? Why Not Seattle or an area with Rainforests? Why do the kids in these movies have to act like all of the life has been taken away by heavy sedatives? Why poisons from a wrist artery? Why not goo?

1147,moffitt2,Good but with big plot holes.,5,14 January 2003,"Signs is a good movie, and I enjoyed it. But it had flaws. I really think there are two separate points that bother most people.The first is the way the film deals with faith and predestination. The film takes the beliefs of many Christian groups about predestination to their logical conclusion.The second bigger problem is due to the incredibly bizarre behavior and nature of the aliens, and the very strange reaction of the humans to the invasion.***Spoilers ahead***Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Some things need an explanation or they ruin the entire movie. Yes, I know Signs wasn't really about aliens. But that doesn't mean that the aliens shouldn't make some kind of sense. I'm also willing to ignore things like the baby monitor that picks up space aliens and the book on aliens that is way too accurate. Those are minor things. I'll even overlook how a small boy manages to calmly kill a large enraged dog with a fork. But, some things were just too major to overlook.
The aliens were burned and injured by water. That's possible I guess. As I remember it, we are immune to water because proteins don't dissolve readily in water. But it might be possible for life to be based on a substance that did dissolve in water, like sugars or something.But an alien like that wouldn't just go walking around on Earth naked. Even humidity would hurt them. One rainstorm and they would melt away. They would last about as long as a naked human would in the sulfuric acid atmosphere of Venus.Water is very common in the universe, very common. There's no way that any alien species wouldn't realize water was harmful to them. It would be like humans not knowing about ammonia or methane.The aliens crossed thousands of light years and they can't even manage to break into an isolated farmhouse? They didn't have a disintegrator ray gun or even a crowbar? They couldn't find a crowbar? They don't know how to start a fire? Nothing the aliens did in any way exhibited intelligence beyond that of chimpanzees.They just came to Earth, made a few crop circles, harassed people for a bit, then started kidnapping people. All of it seems very, very, implausible and this is from someone that has already accepted for the sake of the movie that there are freaking aliens running around on Earth.I guess I could explain it by speculating that the aliens we saw weren't intelligent and were instead a semi intelligent species that was transported to Earth by the intelligent alien species.But Earth has nothing a star traveling species needs. There are thousands of cubic miles of metal rich rock floating around in space. Water is also very plentiful in space too, not that these aliens need water. The only thing on earth that can't be found in space is life. But what good would this be to Aliens, except in a zoo. OK, so maybe the alien plan was to capture humans and put us in a zoo.I'm really having to stretch here. So far we have sugar based aliens that send their semi intelligent slaves to capture humans for zoo animals. I guess that works. The crop circles might have been something to mark pickup areas to the semi intelligent aliens or something.But the real question is, why didn't the family have a gun? That was a rural are where nearly everyone has a few firearms. Even if they didn't have guns in the house they would have managed to get one from somewhere when the problems started. They didn't even have a good pitchfork or axe to fight with.There's no rational explanation for that.I've always thought that people go to ridiculous extremes to explain things like crop circles, which are obviously man made. Perhaps the intent of this movie was to show how absurd some of those beliefs are. On that level it worked very well.Other than that though, I thought Signs was pretty good.",Signs
1148,wayne-106,Too easy and formulaic.,4,22 August 2002,"*Warning Spoiler*I can only assume that the real point of the story is Mel Gibson's character regaining his faith in God, as the rest of the plot is so thin that it can only be considered a convenient prop for the main story line. Unfortunately this piece of the movie doesn't work either. If his change of heart were to have any real meaning it should have been based on something of more substance than a string of coincidences such as his son's asthma protecting him from the poison gas or the baseball bat on the wall coinciding with his wife's dying words. Why not just have his Alpha-bits spell out ""Hello Graham, this is God, and I do exist""? If Shyamalan had guts and was willing to forego the typical happy Hollywood ending, it would have been more effective for the family to face a much more believable sad end at the hands of the aliens, but for Graham to find his faith through the examples of his children and brother, the memory of how his wife faced death, and his own internal resources. On the plus side, Abigail Breslin was charming as Bo and I enjoyed the cinematography by Tak Fujimoto with the crop circles being frequently echoed by such things as the Hess' driveway, the baseball field in town and the throw rug in the living room.

1151,topp1guy,Interesting Thematic Ideas but leaky plot and performances,7,8 August 2002,"Signs is the latest offering of the very talented M. Night Shyamalan. It is set in the ""rural"" area of Bucks County just outside of Philadelphia. Mel Gibson is Graham Hess, a former Priest of no stated church who is angry with God and has lost his faith after the accidental death of his wife. For some odd reason he also has a large farm that has acres of corn fields that he appears to tend with no farm hands or help. Suddenly geometric signs appear in his field and Hess is determined to get to the bottom of this while protecting his family. His crises of faith in God or a guiding force in the Universe is supposed to be the concept that drives the film but weak plotting undermines the idea. Mel Gibson is not entirely successful in conveying Father Hess's confusion and sorrow after the death of his wife. One thinks as a middle age Reverend he must have counseled people on how to deal with the loss of a loved one. Sometime, he must have figured out that times like that are what test your true faith and conviction: but right now he ""hates God."" The Aliens have traveled here for dubious reasons and are ill-equipped to deal with earthlings; though they did have the technology to get here from wherever and make cool patterns in grass and crops. Primitive means are most successful in dealing with them. Perhaps had Mr. Shyamalan formally collaborated with someone the plot could have supported his lofty questions of faith.",Signs

It may have perhaps been the writer's intention to have the viewers' experience the happenings from a rural farmer's family perspective, but nonetheless, the ""realism"" aspect of the story was hard to grasp, mostly because of the lack of revealing the reactions from people on a wider scale. To me, story-line was weak, and it seemed to me the crop circles were the least touched-upon element of the movie.  However, the movie did a good job of grabbing your attention and keeping the suspense going, with many scenes that may make you jump.  The movie is still worth seeing, but it may come as somewhat of a disappointment for a film starring Mel Gibson.",Signs

1155,abomination,Good?,7,8 August 2002,"Signs is an insane trip that'll have you looking around every corner but unfortunately, that doesn't make a very good movie.  It's undoubtedly one of the scariest movies I've ever seen and it was very well done.  On the other hand, it wasn't very well thought out.For example: The aliens are all advanced 'n stuff, they come from who knows where, they have cloaking space ships that don't emit any kind of anything, they can hover perfectly with no problem, then they get water on em and totally die.  Wouldn't they have expected that?  Especially because Earth is 2/3s made up of water, why the hell would they come here?  And not only do they come here regardless of the water thing, they come here completely naked?  Lame.Besides the fact that it wasn't very well thought out, it was still a trip of a movie.  One hell of a scary movie for sure.  I give it a 7/10",Signs
1156,BradyNickJoe,Another stunning piece from Shyamalan.,10,2 October 2002,"It's difficult to say too much about how good this film is, without giving too much away.  As with ""Unbreakable"" and ""Sixth Sense"", I found myself waiting for a twist of some sort, and as everything comes to a climax at the end, I was not disappointed. There are some very dark moments, yet having Mel Gibson in the lead allows some careful use of humour to balance this, without lessening the tension and very real menace. I found myself thinking about the film the day after, with the hairs on my neck standing up, it was really that good! Thankfully, it is not a film weighed down with special effects, Shyamalan tells his story through the eyes of Hess.  Somehow, it made the terror all the more real, since it is difficult not to like this gentle character. Overall, thank goodness the film industry has talent like M.Night Shyamalan, a storyteller and thought provoking artist at the same time.",Signs
1157,cormaicmacairt,***Contains Spoilers***,1,16 September 2002,"This has got to be one of the worst films I have seen in years.The plot was unbelievably formulaic (man loses faith, man has scary experience, man overcomes scary experience, man regains faith). I mean, come on, how about a bit of originality here. I had high hopes for this film having seen The Sixth Sense and was sorely disappointed with the trite that was Signs.Also, there were gaping holes (nay, yawning chasms) in the plot - ***spoiler coming*** I mean to say, why would aliens who can be killed with mere water, attack a planet whose surface is >60% water and whose inhabitants are >80% water? Hello?At least I know that if those aliens ever do come to Earth, I'll be safe here in Ireland (land of a thousand raindrops!).",Signs
1158,ferdiverweij,Independence Day without explosions,5,6 October 2002,"(SPOILERS HERE) I have a mixed up feeling about this film. Sure, the suspense in it builds itself, real slow. Nice. The way it all made me think of an Independence Day without Will Smith and without the air combats could satisfy me only because from the beginning, I was just curious of one thing: what's the catch? What will happen with this one? Certainly no nuclear weapon set off in space!Well, the ending is dissapointing. Until then, you have seen a few glimps of extra terrestrial creatures, but not much...just enough too be scary. In the end, though (spoiler) you get to see all of it. By then, the alien population left earth (for NO reason) and it's all of a sudden easy for Gibson&Phoenix to beat the last one out there, threatening Gibson's son. This is in daylight, and we get to see the poorly designed alien holding Rory Culkin in his hands. Why do these aliens always have to look the same: green (although this one can change colors, which is nice), barely naked humanlike body and a big, triangled head? It was a major dissapointed towards the end of a movie, where the first question (before starting) remains your only question through out the film: What can possibly be scary about some crop circles in Gibson's field? Well, these 'signs' aren't that important, and apparently, the rules of suspense aren't either to the director, showing us the alien in the (happy) end, it being nothing more than a regular thriller/horror movie with an outstanding cast.This means: a great movie for the average cinema-visitor, but a little dissapointed concerning the gifted mind of mister Shyamalan. I expected more of him, as I was afraid of. Maybe next time he can direct a Schwarzenegger action flick or a Sally Field drama, or maybe a Jim Carrey comedy, because this genre brings up too much expectations for him to achieve.",Signs
1159,abicool,Heavy Stuff,9,6 August 2002,"Now firstly i got stranded with a very bad print of this movie and although i am strictly against piracy, i couldn't wait 3-4 months for it to release. The movie is Shyamalan's 2nd since ""sixth sense"" which i regard as his masterpiece. In this movie he also makes a slight shift from the system he had succesfuly used in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. This time there is no surprise ending; unless you call Gibson's return to faith that.So the movie instead of dealing with the supernatural deals with aliens; but not completely. The aliens are just a backdrop to the story of a man who loses his faith and events force him to regain his belief in a supreme power. Understandably, the scary moments( which were missing to an extent in Unbreakable) hold your attention to the story and meanwhile the main story is unfolded through glimpses. I felt phoenix was great here and dabs in with very subtle moments of humour. The kids are great especially culkin's delivery is breathtaking. Gibson does a good job of what could have been a disaster. He underplays the part and doesn't go over the top forming the crux of the film.Overall,good stuff. i'd recommend it to anybody.",Signs

I understand that life throws many curves at you but to dovetail it with an ""Independence Day"" style invasion of malevolent aliens ruined the struggle for me and brought it from the philosophical to the ridiculous.Joaquin Phoenix' acting was done well, though.I'm still not a fan of any Culkin actor.

The credits at the beginning of the film were eerily done - setting the tone of a scary, terrifying suspenseful show.  If you decide to attend - be prepared to take a look at the way people behave in stressful situations.  It is very similar to what many people may have felt following 9/11, entranced, scared, helpless, hopeless, wanting to be educated about something we don't understand...  Mel Gibson and Joaquin play brilliant adult male figures with two children Rory and Abigail, and the police officer (Cherry Jones)is a strong female who helps bridge many bits of the storyline.  If you are a fan of M. Night Shyamalan, this film continues his edge on unique film script and direction.",Signs

From the opening credits to the end the movie maintained a high sense of fear and apprehension. The cast was marvelous especially the youngsters and I loved the slight build-up of tension with the use of the extra-terrestrials and Shyamalan's use of faith. This was definitely a Type-A thriller that is worth seeing again...but maybe in my own household where I have the disposal of pillows.,Signs

Often I have not felt the impact of his movies until I have walked out of the theatre and sat thinking about later on. I was bit skeptic as to how can he pull off an Alien invasion movie, which is more of a popcorn movie theme, but he has done it brilliantly. It's not so much about Aliens, but more about human fear and faith and it's brilliantly executed. Don't go and see this movie expecting a Spielberg-like suspense thriller, it's deeper than that. Fear of Alien invasion has never been so realistically portrayed before.",Signs
1165,lor-4,Poor script - I was bored,1,21 August 2002,"I was completely bored throughout the movie. I found it agonizingly slow and not really much happened for a film that was hyped up so much.WARNING - SPOILERSI had a real hard time believing in the aliens. There were so many contradictions I found it annoying to watch.If the aliens had the technology to fly to earth in spaceships, then surely they could easily overpower the humans or have much more technologically advanced weapons than the silly gas idea. I mean, having to get that close to humans to overpower them is a sure way to lose any fight. And if they were only there to gather a few specimens, why arrive in such a conspicuous way?Many of us had problems with the water hurting them. Since this planet is water based, surely they would have a problem with the air which can be up to 90 percent water!They seemed quite weak and vulnerable, with no resistance to a simple wooden door, knives, baseball bats etc. Gee, what about the guns normal American people keep in their homes?The script was the big problem. And the basic plot was just that...basic! It's a *yawn* tried over and again idea. Man loses faith, man regains faith...boooorrriiinnnggg. Why not be a bit more adventurous and do it the other way around??? Man becomes religious, then realizes he's made a big mistake and goes back to being a non-believer. We need some balls in the US film industry.",Signs
1166,alexvergan,The more I think about this movie the less I like it...,5,20 January 2003,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, however upon my second viewing, I started thinking that it was a bit too much..For example(warning, some spoilers ahead)1.These aliens are big and look very agile. How the hell does our friend Night Shymalan wrestle this dude in the pantry. C'mon any human being would get a huge ass-whupping from these guys.2.Why the hell would Night Shymalan or Mel Gibson not call the police upon discovery of ET'S scary cousin in the house. They have just seen an alien...wouldn't you at least call 911 or the policewoman...any normal human being would.3.After learning that the UFO's are to be found a mile from the crop circles, any normal family would pack up and get the hell out of their farm. At least go in town where it's probably safer....even if you think it's the end of the world, I'd rather be with a bunch of people, then all alone with my brother and 2 kids in the middle of nowhere, fighting these aliens.4.These aliens come from god knows where, have built a technology that we probably will not see here for centuries to come..... you're going to tell me that they can't figure a way to get through a basement door...c'mooooooooooon.5. These ultra-intelligent beings have only vapors to kill us.....they haven't developed weapons.......what the hell...they build flying saucers that travel millions of miles that can render themselves invisible, but they don't have any weapons(even if it's ground war, they can use some type of weapons without provoking us to use nuclear weapons)6. Knowing (I would assume that with their intelligence they would know that earth and every living being on it is made up of 80% water) what water does to them, you would think they would have developed some kind of protection to H2O.I think the bottom line is I should have watched this movie once only.",Signs

1168,Dilpikle20,Signs Rules!,10,4 August 2002,"I was worried at first that M. Night was gonna spend all his time filming random objects and overly dramatic pauses and obnoxious beats in dialogue and very little of the aliens in the movie. After I saw Signs, I realized that he did exactly what I worried about...and it was perfect. Everyone can spot an M. Night film when they see it for his obsessions with having just as much silence as he does noise and filming all his shots through cracks, holes, and crevices. It worked perfectly for The Sixth Sense, sucked for Unbreakable, and kicked ass for Signs. His style really seems to be top-notch when he's making a scary flick. The silence and the unseen is what scares you alot for Signs, and when you actually do see something, M. Night smacks you in the face with it whether you were expecting it or not. This movie successfully scared me. Only a few movies have done that (it still hasn't beaten Event Horizon). The acting is great in this movie (finally good kid actors are found besides Haley Joel), and the script is superb. M. Night puts in enough plot and character development to make the movie more than just a horror flick. He doesn't abuse the awesome-looking aliens he created by showing too much too often. He also avoids all the horror-movie cliches you usually expect in most scary flicks. Signs makes your skin crawl and makes you jump out of your seat. It's been a long time since I heard the entire movie theater of people scream out all together. M. Night rules! Also, props to the composer, James Newton Howard, for the spine-tingling music.",Signs

I liked Unbreakable, because of it's unusual plot line.I was however interested in Signs from the beginning, because I'm a Mel Gibson fan, and because I've always been fascinated by crop circles. Still the fact that it was Shymalan held back my enthusiasm. I'm glad to say my fears were misguided and I'm now a huge Shymalan fan.This is the first movie that I've ever seen that I personally can say was an emotional roller coaster, it's hilarious, terrifying, heartbreaking, and thought-provoking in the same instant. All the performances are top-notch, especially the little girl that plays Bo Hess, for such a young age she is a wonderful actress.This film has surpassed The Crow to become my all time favorite movie. I really can give no higher recommendation then that. Go see,now, trust me, you'll be glad you listened.",Signs
1174,Highly_Suspicious,"eery, relentless, melevolent, profoundly moving.",9,18 August 2002,"I was looking forward to seeing this one from the first (and last, remarkebly) time i saw the trailer, during a screening of LOTR. so little was revealed about a central idea that was so broad in interpretation that it grabbed me immediately. to add to its promotional strength, the name M. Night Shyamalan was tacked on to the title...after months of subtle publicity and growing anticipation on behalf of anxious punters like myself, i finally got the chance to see it. 'Signs' is without a doubt a fantastic piece of cinema. Shyamalan has achieved to create a complex, multilayered and effective film using old-school methods and challenges his audience with a 'less-is-more' philosophy. we find ourselves searching the screen desperately with our eyes and our ears, trying to prepare ourselves for the inevitable. the most startling thing about this film is that despite all our mental preparation, the inevitable does arrive, and it still terrifies us. we know somethings in the cupboard. we hold our breath and clutch the seat while mel investigates. the silence is unbearable and we strain to hear signs of life on the other side of the door. and then...the timing in this film is pure perfection. genuine, contextualized humour is interwoven beautifully with the tension, and the interplay between the characters is great. this isn't a jerky, angular film. it moves very organically as the tension builds up, undulates with small injections of humour and doubt, before reaching crescendoes that linger and spill into the next sequence.the thematic elements within the story aren't entirely original. Alien invasion, the questioning of personal faith, small town anxiety and isolation have all been delt with in many forms, but the way in which Shyamalan gels them together and the influence and importance he allows them to hold in the final story gives them strength. each element doesn't simply present itself, leave an imprint and recede into the next one, they feed off each other and present different contexts for the others to play against. it deals with faith, and this is presented in a number of ways. one thing i noticed in particular was in the opening shot of an empty backyard and the surrounding cornfield through a window. the camera pans out and the yard becomes slightly distorted with the inconsistancy of the glass. in one of the final shots, after the faith of mels character is tried tested and ultimately prevails, a similar shot of the backyard through a broken window reveals a clear image of a family united.i could go on but time and space limit me. the characters are great, and the performances reflect a rare maturity in all the cast members (for the first time in a long time, mel gibson was Father Hess, not mel gibson). sound design was fantastic, particularly the eery chittering of the ghostly visitors and their moonlit rooftop antics. lighting and camera work was suitably moody, ensuring once and for all my absence from and near any and all cornfields EVER. a fantastic score adds even more unearthly life to the relentless melevolence of shadows and shapes surrounding the house and breathes audible relief into moments of moving personal triumph.as i said, i could continue ad bloody nauseum about this film, but i'll allow you to reflect on it yourself, or if you haven't seen it, catch it while it's still on the big screen. so before you go to bed tonight, tie up your dog in the barn, lock your doors and windows, board up the attic door, put a glass of water by your bed and if one were so inclined perhaps say a prayer. and if one weren't so inclined, see the movie and you soon will be.",Signs
1175,pjbauer10,I'm offended,10,15 August 2002,"I am the kind of person that gets offended and annoyed by other people's ignorance and stupidity.  I read many of the reviews given by other IMDb users before seeing this movie, and frankly I'm kind of mad.  Some people were saying that this movie has a ridiculous ending which ruined the movie. Some said it was Shyamalan's worst film yet.  It seems like these people don't understand the movie.Everyone should agree that the performances were great, especially the kids. Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin were brilliantly casted and fit their characters.  Joaquin Phoenix had a really funny character and did a good job providing the comic relief, and of course Mel Gibson was great.Everyone should know by now that the movie is about a former reverend who has lost his faith after the death of his wife and lives with his brother and two kids who have found what seem to be crop circles on their property, right? Good.Now the important part...*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Do you remember the movie about the lovable farmer/Vietnam vet/shrimp boat captain/probably a lot of other stuff played by Tom Hanks? Of course you do, it's Forrest Gump.  And do you remember the meaning of that movie - how he was trying to figure out if there was a God and if everything has a meaning and is meant to happen? Well in case you didn't know, this movie had the same meaning, and the same plot.M. Night Shyamalan just decided to mix that plot with an alien invasion rather than a mentally disabled farmer/Vietnam vet/shrimp boat captain/probably a lot of other stuff.  Shyamalan felt like scaring everyone again, something that he is very good at and did a very good job at with this movie.  For the people who thought the aliens looked cheesy and ruined the movie, how else do you think they should look?  Shyamalan found something that everyone fears and brought it to the big screen in a very realistic way based on what people have thought aliens looked like and what an invasion would be like.  If you thought he should have left the appearance of the aliens to your imagination, he left something more important to the audience's and the characters' imagination... the actual invasion.  He wanted you to feel like you were there.  Also, without the aliens just leaving, there would have had to be a big war or the end of the world, and without one of the aliens threatening the characters you would have felt ripped off.  If you didn't want to feel ripped off, you would have to show the alien when it threatened the characters. Personally I think an invisible alien would be the worst thing you could do.  It was very interesting how the plot developed and how it showed the different details that turned out to have an impact at the end of the movie, and it was touching to see Mel Gibson's character re-gain his faith at the end.  The ending was by no means ridiculous and surely didn't ruin it.

Thanks to a fellow reviewer ""Paul Tempke"" and a second viewing, I can say ""By George I got it!"" The whole movie is shown from child's Point Of View. That's why it feels childish.

At least I prefer those people who hated the movie because me too after the first viewing hated the movie. but I was unsatisfied and would not believe that the man who made Sixth Sense would make such a movie with so many obvious plot holes. I am glad there is more to this movie than you think. I think the whole alien story is Bo's dream. Key to that is the book which Morgan referes to. If you see the thought process in the Alien story it is really as if a child would think. The use of baby monitor, water, baseball bat all indicates that she is behind that thinking. I think she was reading that book and fell asleep, now she is imagining the things from the book (Farm House, Crop circles, Aliens) and people she knows. I am pretty sure about this part.

I was listening like the husband nudged by groggy wife with ""did you hear that noise""-- the entire movie. I felt Shyamalan's grip as an artist- not deigning-down to me with the avant-garde but using commonplace  sensations like fleeting visions and noises half-heard. I'm sure this engrosses an audience of sentients more than explosions and special-effects. All that and  surprisingly generous dollops of laugh out loud funny dialogue make this a must-see event. Topped off by an audience-rousing splat of slugging brother's bat to alien's head, I wouldn't have changed one thing.

1180,lennybird91,"A great thriller, but not your typical alien movie",8,7 January 2011,"Signs is a wonderfully crafted movie, going far deeper than I ever remembered it being back when I watched it as a twelve year old. Characters exhibit growth and dynamicism, while the entire film is very diverse with its thrilling and scary scenes, heart-wrenchingly tragic recollections, and pondering conversations. On the surface, it's a film about a man and his kids and brother on a farmhouse coming to terms with the onslaught of an alien invasion. Going deeper, it's a movie about coincidences versus miracles--are you faithful, or are you being reasonable? Countless times throughout the film, situations directly ask this question--was it meant to be? Or was it by chance? Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is an ex-preacher who lost his faith after his wife died in a freak accident. His outlook lays the groundwork for his decisions made throughout the movie.It's amazing how scary a movie can be without even seeing an actual alien. Throughout the movie, the suspense builds up, and then more details are revealed to the viewer, satisfying their anticipation. Then there's the grand finale, so to speak.I believe where this movie shines is in the cinematography, music score, and ambient sounds. Some may say the acting is a little plain, but frankly, I picture their entire situation as shock. Considering that the crop circles began appearing only 6 months after Graham's wife died, the whole family would still not have gotten completely over the original fact--let alone aliens. Shock numbs the emotions.I've seen this movie several times, now, and I always enjoy it.",Signs

Mostly delivered by Merrill Hess played by Joaquin Phoenix.  The comedy delivered is the only thing that let me relax for a brief time until that starry eyed looked from Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) was seen again and you knew something was about to happen, or was it?

What is the most amazing thing about it is the incredible acting from every single actor.  Of course Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix did a superb job, but also his children in the movie were very understandable self-sufficient and intelligent themselves. The family was so close that you felt every shutter that ran though them, and shuttered yourself.  This movie didn't try to but funny, but the wit of it made you laugh during odd parts of it.  Of course the movie had frightening parts, very frightening, however, it was much more emotional. The family didn't suddenly become aggressive, and launch a full attack on the aliens, which would be unrealistic for a former priest.  They simply did what they could only do, hope and protect themselves for whatever was to come.  This movie is much like Contact, but in my view better because of the focusing on the actor's emotions rather than the aliens and action.  And unlike Contact, we are given a conclusion and aren't left in the dark.

1186,jgsmeall,Thematically Frayed; Unintegrated,1,22 September 2002,"Despite the glowing receptions, both critically and popularly, for ""Signs"", M. Night Shyamalan's third descent into the underworld of horror thrillers, I was ultimately disappointed by his laughable take on the phenomenon of crop circles. As far as I'm concerned, out of all the movies Shyamalan has made, only one, ""Sixth Sense"" (1999), has actually succeeded in raising demons, let alone eyebrows, for me; and even ""Sixth Sense"", stylish as it was, was quickly outdone in two years by Alejandro Amenabar's genuinely terrifying reworking of the gothic ghost story genre, ""The Others""(2001).It's sad to see a sci-fi thriller with potential like ""Signs"" flop into a banal puddle of theistic pop-psychobabble and jejune derivations from ""War of the Worlds"". The first half of ""Signs"" was slightly creepy and chilling due to an unnervingly tense atmosphere, and it seemed that Shyamalan is sticking to his tried-and-true method of scaring his audiences with what they can't see, rather than what they can. But when the not-so-little green men began popping out of the cornfield; and Mel Gibson - thinly disguised as an Anglican minister-turned-atheist - with his whiny, snot-nosed offspring, was forced to retreat to the cellar of his dismal farmhouse to escape the inevitable, it became sadly clear that the final confrontation would not produce a suitably chilling ""whodunit?"" surprise ending, typical of ""Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others"", but rather a preachy, self-satisfied response to the question of whether Mel Gibson will regain his lost faith. Uninspired and lackluster.",Signs
1187,sys-drako,"It's a brilliant emotional, scary, family movie.",8,5 April 2011,"What a simply brilliant and well-made movie is ""Signs"" by Manoj Night Shyamalan. The ingenious ideas of linking the whole movie with aliens, coincidences, the existence of a supreme power, the ever wavering human mind and how events change a person for good or bad Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors I have seen And the script has been so well written that it suits perfectly for a person like him. The super caring and concerned Father who is going through a personal misery. And the two kids have played their parts brilliantly too. Especially the little girl is really cute. And the brother has played his part really well. Everyone has played their parts so well that the movie feels so real. The movie's script has been really well thought. The way the things are linked right from the beginning till the very end. Including the brain nerves of Mel's wife going all crazy and recollecting ""Swing away"" and Mel thinking about his wife all though the movie resulting in the outstanding climax that suits this movie perfectly. The boy having asthma and the aliens secreting small amounts of poison. This movie is quite simply made of coincidences and has been put forth brilliantly. And the very simple fact that they hardly even show the Alien, is the best part. One of the many concepts of crop circles being for navigation and they are for forming maps . The aliens using only hand to hand combat as they know that humans would eventually use nuclear weapons making the planet useless . Shows how well the movie has been made. The dialogs have been so well written. Touching , really sensible & perfectly written in context. Yes there are some clichés here and there that cannot be avoided while making a movie.

But why do things always level out on the side of the first group, those who believe in a higher being dictating events/lack of coincidence, just to appease a God-fearing society and probably the film's backers? What about a voice for us lot in the second ""sh*t happens"" group for once?And why did M. Night Shyamalan feel the need to show us that rubbery 'alien' wobbling about at the end?

Robert Rodriquez threw out the same plot device in his vastly superior ""From Dusk Til Dawn"", but whereas he at least handled the situation in an extremely tongue in cheek manner, Shyamalan's serious portrayal of the situation is, quite frankly, cheesy.This is unfortunate, as the movie does have several good points - it is extremely well directed, well acted, and the interplay between the humor and suspense inherent within the situation is extremely effective.  The fact that the alien invasion is basically handled as a ""non-event"" does not bother me - I believe it is an extremely interesting way of looking at the situation.However, these points fail to redeem this movie.  Once again, I feel that I have been a victim of Hollywood's ceaseless attempts to ram their half-baked moral cliche's where they are unwanted.(Note to self : never again expect Mel Gibson to appear in something which doesn't involving a concerned father looking after his children, and struggling with his own personal demons - further note to self, steer clear of ANYTHING involving Mel Gibson if diabetes is a problem - lethal injection of saccharine could result)A very average 5/10 I'm afraid",Signs

The story of an alien invasion and crop circles feels like something from the 1950's film Invaders From Mars. Signs has a good plot but it seems to be missing more of the action and suspense that audiences today demand.

1195,mani_ratnam,The ending worked for me,10,6 August 2002,"********** SPOILERS ***********I read a couple of bad reviews of this movie and decided to see it without any expectations. I was amazed at how much I ended up enjoying it. I was impressed by The Sixth Sense but didn't really enjoy it that much.I saw this movie on opening night, along with the rest of a sold-out audience. It elicited laughs and screams and sighs. The air was really thick with tension in the suspenseful moments and not a sound could be heard. I was sitting at the edge of my seat.The Acting: Absolutely top notch. Mel Gibson moved me to tears in the scenes outside the vet's house, and at the dinner table. I hated Joaquin Phoenix in The Gladiator, but loved him in this movie. Both the kids are terrific. Abigail Breslin steals every scene she is in (she is so cute, and when she was crying I wanted to go and hold her and console her), but Rory Culkin's performance gives an extremely sensitive, nuanced performance {the anti McCaulay Culkin performance}.Sound and sound editing: Perfect. The Brazilian birthday scene is made more frightening by the perfect use of sound.Visual effects: Minimal and Perfectly used. This movie is not visual eye candy like Attack of the Clones. This allows you to be absorbed in the *story*.Direction and Cinematography were excellent, especially in heightening the suspense. The scary scenes work so well because of the brilliant camera angles.The Ending: Some of the audience members were clapping with delight in the final scenes, while others were disappointed. Personally, the ending worked for me in the context of the movie, especially in the way it tied up all the ends together (yes, the water does not make much sense scientifically but I will not let that get in the way of enjoying this movie).It has also been a long while since a movie has absorbed me so much. Because this is a quiet, minimalist movie, I emerged from the theatre without a headache (as in Pearl Harbor) and without my eyes watering.",Signs
1196,Mr Yakamoto,Worst Plot Ever,1,7 August 2002,"Ok imagine this, you are part of a super advanced alien colony that needs to attack another planet to survive. You decide that Earth looks good enough so you start heading towards it. You finally get there and all looks good, you have the planet in your grasp, until wait! oh no! You forgot that you went to a planet that is 90% water and water makes your freaking skin melt off. This movie features some of the biggest plot holes i have ever seen and some of the crappiest aliens also. I think the thing that bothered me the most about this movie (no not M. Night Shyamalamandingdong's pitiful attempt at acting) was the scene in which one of the aliens was beaten mercilessly with a baseball bat and did absolutely nothing to stop from being killed. These are the same aliens that could jump up on 10 foot high roofs in a matter of seconds and yet they apparently cannot do anything but stand still when being beaten over the head with a bat. I will give this movie some credit however because if you look past the bad acting and the retarded aliens there are a few scenes with very good cinematography. Lastly, I hope to God that if the Earth is attacked by aliens in the future, they are the ones from this movie so all you have to do to survive is stand by a freaking sprinkler.",Signs
1197,rikkimima,Not your average Alien movie,8,24 September 2002,"After seeing ""The Sixth Sense"" which to me was a really amazing movie, I was a little disappointed with Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"". So I was really eager to see if ""Signs"" could tell me if ""the 6th Sense"" had just been a lucky shot or if ""Unbreakable"" was just a little bump in the road. And to tell the truth, despite what others might say, ""Signs"" is an amazingly good movie. It just proves to me that Shyamalan is a great director (and a good actor too, cos he's in the movie as well).Some will say that ""Signs"" is just a mix of various other movies (The Birds, War of the Worlds, Encounters of the third kind,...) but that just proves they are missing the point of the whole movie. This movie isn't about the aliens. No. It's about a family coming closer together in adversity. The alien-story is almost secondary, but i liked it nonetheless (the part where they show the alien in Brazil is really scary).The characters are recognizable to everyone and that really isn't that obvious in a science-fiction/thriller movie. Whatever bad (or good) thing happens to the family, you can always relate to them. Mel Gibson is great in this movie (almost as good as in ""Braveheart"") as are Joaquin Phoenix and both kids. This film is good because like every other Shyamalan movie it has a message: nothing ever 'just happens' by accident. Most things happen for a purpose. And as you'll watch, you'll find out too.So to be brief: This isn't a story about Aliens invading earth but a story of a family coming closer together (during an Alien invasion).I give it 8 out of 10.Have fun watching! It's most certainly worth it.",Signs

Some have complained that if the aliens have studied earth, and are coming to get earth's resources, then why didn't they know that water was deadly to them, and why didn't they wear wet-suits. First of all, if there's no water on their planet, then they've probably never felt it.  Therefore, they didn't know it's harmful to them.  Second of all, this may sound like a cheap explanation, but maybe, they didn't wear suits because they were wearing a skin-tight protective shield, or perhaps they just underestimated earthlings and didn't think that they would need the suits.",Signs

Think about this:  if the aliens do know about water but have never visited earth and have never felt water, then they wouldn't know that water is harmful to them. They have no water on their planet.  Also, that alien is computer-generated for the most part at the end of the film.  They wanted him to be designed like a human. Also, many have complained about Shyamalan getting effects happy and giving in to showing the alien at the end.  The next time you watch the movie, imagine the final scene without the alien.  I did, and it looked pretty stupid. Shyamalan knows what he's doing, and he does it well.  Signs is close to being a masterpiece and should get some Oscar nominations.  9 out of 10 stars.",Signs

Perhaps they did wear skin-tight suits, not realizing the suits could be harmed by water too. In a movie like this, nearly anything is possible. The movie states that the aliens didn't like water, but maybe the aliens didn't know the water was as harmful as it was to them.

Too many of the reviews I have read here sound like they are coming from pretentious ""intellectuals"" who viewed Signs with a bias, ready to pick it apart because it was beneath them and unable to appreciate the film for what it really is.  For those of you who feel that way (obviously brainwashed collegiate types), why do you even bother seeing mainstream movies?  Just stick to your subtitled pedantic garbage and let the rest of the world enjoy life!Anyway, I digress.  Signs was everything a Hollywood movie should be (in a realm where few are).  Shyamalan has proved himself again in this creepy and startling, while at the same time comedic and thought-provoking, movie.  My initial response to this film was that the ending fell short.  But the more I reflected on the movie, the more I realized that the alien aspect was not the story that was really being told.  Someone on here wrote that the movie had two levels, one shallow and one deeper.  I think that's true and is the reason why Signs will appeal to so many.  But mostly, it was ENTERTAINMENT - something most movies have been missing since special effects took over the industry.  I felt the movie was second in ""fright factor"" only to The Exorcist.  And at the end, I was not looking forward to returning to my big old house in Bucks County, PA which is within walking distance of corn fields (ok, so it hit home a little!).If I could have one wish (as far as movies are concerned), it would be that I could watch each M. Night film without ever having seen The Sixth Sense. It seems that many, myself included, cannot watch any of his movies without making the comparison (just as I do with Pulp Fiction and anything Quentin did after it).

The movie is beautifully filmed and directed, but as the ending credits began to roll I felt there had to be more.Unlike ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" which dealt with earth-bound topics, ""Signs"" spends too much time eluding to aliens that we never get to see much of.  That worked well during the first half of the movie when you're not sure if the entire thing is a hoax or not; however, by the end of the movie I found myself wishing that I could have seen more of what was going on in the corn field and less of what was going on in Gibson's beautiful Victorian farm house.""Signs"" is a good movie, worth the price of admission, but if Shyamalan truly is ""The Next Spielberg"" as Newsweek Magazine proclaims, then he needs to show us what's going on in the corn field and in the sky above Mexico City next time.",Signs

There's no doubt M Night is a talented director, but a scriptwriter he ain't and as an actor he makes Tarantino look good.  Alright, the movie didn't bore me, which is a good sign, but it sured bored a lot of people at the screening I saw.  I've never heard more mumbling or people shifting in their seats.First, the acting.  The kids were good, and Mel & Joaquin did reasonably well, but some of the supporting roles were really poor: the female cop, the army sargeant & especially M Night himself.  I really hated the bit where they were sitting in the diner going ""Is he the guy?"", which was clearly intended to carry a double meaning, of ""Is he that talented young director everyone's going on about?"".  His role was too important to the movie to squander on such a poorly-acted ego-massaging cameo.SPOILER: Second, the alien invasion was lame: I really didn't get why they wouldn't use any weaponry.  To avoid nuclear attack?  That is SO lame! Surely an unarmoured ground assault is far more vulnerable to nuking that a highly mobile air war?  It is completely illogical, as Mr Spock might say.However, my main sticking point with the movie was the horrible ""you gotta have faith"" theme.  SPOILER(ish):  You could see a mile off that Mel was going to recover his faith in god, but what a lame way to go about it. What kind of weak stupid capricious deity just interferes in the world by giving people good luck?  Surely the whole concept of a benevolent one-god depends entirely upon his/her pro-active engagement with the lives of the people he has chosen to ""care"" for?Enlightenment comes with the rejection of superstitious outmoded belief structures and the acceptance of your status as an individual in control of your own destiny.  In explicitly stating that faith makes you a stronger person, more able to deal with trauma and tragedy, M Night spits in the face of those of us who have achieved some small aspect of enlightenment and rejected such superstitious, uneducated, blind folly.

1208,neoxman,Stylish & Original...2002's best film.,10,11 September 2002,"Here is a film with a very basic plot that has been written and directed in a unique style unlike anything we have ever seen. M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most amazing cinema storytellers, he has grown to become one of my favorite writer/director in recent years. His latest dramatic sci-fi thriller `SIGNS' has proven that Mr. Night can create so much with so little. `SIGNS' tells a basic `alien invasion story', but M. Night is NOT going to show us 20 different flying space ships blowing things up here and there, instead he is going to put us inside a family home with characters that are suffering real emotions to those that the audience can relate to. The suspense is well balanced with the comedic and dramatic side of the story. The most amazing thing about this film is how M. Night has us (the audience) paying attention to every little detail and how we are deeply seeing something when there is nothing to see, the suspense scenes don't reveal the horror right in our faces but rather in our minds. The director leaves a shot long enough for us to imagine the unthinkable by providing sounds of what we can NOT see. `SIGNS' is not a film about crop circles nor aliens; that is just a background to what the real meaning of the plot is, which in an M. NIGHT style it builds up to an answer revealed at the end of the film. This is my #1 film for 2002.

Someone could have done a similar job, delivered the same message and have more action in less than 5 minutes. The movie is all based in one place (two if you count the scene of them in town), and is yet again a way of getting people to believe in god.Lets start with the aliens!  First of all, they are 'allergic' to water. If these aliens are seriously smart enough to invade a planet and have the technology to make things invisible, you'd expect them to wear some sort of protective clothing to reduce contact with water.  And what do they do when it rains?  Water will be pouring down all over, are they supposed to stay inside until it's a dry day?  Second of all, if they are smart, they would use another method of communicating (such as a tracking device) rather than killing crops.  Third of all, the aliens of course, have to have the two arms, two legs, two eyes, mouth etc just like us humans do, but of course, without the clothes and genitalia.  Last of all, they communicate using radios, and as predictable as it may seem, a typical baby monitor can pick up the radio signals.  What are the odds, that these aliens invading a planet full of poison (to them) would use a radio frequency identical to a baby monitors!There is no climax in the entire movie, there is nothing to look forward to. The so-called scary scenes are nothing compared to other movies. Independence Day has better and scarier scenes than this movie, and the aliens aren't allergic to an abundant source on the planet either!  More than half the movie is based on the farm and in the house.The little girl who claims there is something wrong with every glass of water she drinks is just a dumb idea.  She would have to be bent in the head to think there is something wrong with every glass she drinks.Overall I say this movie stinks.  Go see a comedy for a better time, and don't bother with this bible-based movie.  All it's here to do is to lure you into religion, and get you to start believing in god.I give it 1 / 10, because it made me laugh a few times.",Signs

The plot is kind of stupid and unbelievable, but that is secondary to the human struggles going on with Grant, Merrill, and the children.  The events occuring worldwide are out-of-focus and surreal, but the fear, confusion, and family bonding of the family are intense.   The characters are stressed out by the death of their wife and mother six months prior, and the alien invasion puts them all close to psychosis.  They make it through the crisis of the attack, but whether the strength comes from a mystical message from the dying wife/mother, common sense (hit them with the bat, stupid), or a little of both, are questions that this film tantalizes with.

Everything seems unusally loud and moviegoers are transported into the film along with the cast. There is nothing to distract anyone from what unfurls onscreen, nothing. Another aspect of signs is the camera work. The photography is indirect and has a very artistic feel to it. But it is also a letdown.What may have otherwisebeen accomplished with pomp and superb camera work is not. The camera angles and shooting of the concluding sequence in Graham's living room is surprising and lacks what one would expect. It's as if Shyamalan couldn't handle an action sequence. What Shyamalan wins by way of build-up and mystery, he looses in leaving too many loose ends and too much left unexplained. In an era of films like Independence Day and such, Signs leads us to beleive we will see more of some contact between intergalatic races and then when we do not, it is a letdown. A sort of anticlimax. And then, in retrospect, the film is not smooth. Scenes just seem to be put together with no flow and some times even border on ridiculous and cumbersome. What saves the movie and is worth serious moviegoers' time, is a superb performance by Mel Gibson, climaxing in an emotional dinner scene with his family. All in all, SIgns is a grabber upto the last ten minutes.",Signs

The audience would gasp and fly back into their chairs as if we were headed down a steep incline.  Just as we would relax, bam! Another twist and scare!The suspense harkens to the best of Hitchcock.  The music is haunting, much as John Carpenter's ""Chiming Bells"" from ""Halloween.""  Like ""Halloween,"" there is no slasher-type close-ups and then bam, a big scare.  But many times you feel the scares coming, a la ""Jaws,"" and there's nothing you can do to stop them.  You just have to ride it out!Some complain about the subplot, but it adds the heart to the movie.

I went into the theater with my doubts, but because so many people referred me to this movie I decided I should see it. Was I ever impressed. Shyamalan made a very on the edge of your seat type of film. There were plenty of points in the film that straight up startled me, and what didn't startle me sure as hell gave me goosebumps. Along with that, there was a good amount of humor in the film that added quite a bit without negating the thriller-type tone of the film.Extra Terrestrials or just a bunch of geeks? If they are extra terrestrials, are they hostile or friendly? Are they really out there? Who could have created all those signs?I would love to say more about the film if I could, but there's not much more to tell without spoiling the plot. There are two main struggles in this film. The struggle between the humans and what they believe are aliens, and the struggle of a former reverend(Gibson) who has been losing his faith since the loss of his wife. Of course, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance in his film, as he does ever so often. His character is integral to the story although he is only seen in about 3 short scenes.For once again entertaining me with a well made film, I give M. Night Shyamalan 5out of 5 stars for a VERY solid movie with an excellent plot.",Signs
1222,bradley-kehoe,A family living on a farm finds mysterious crop circles in their fields which suggests something more frightening to come.,10,17 December 2011,"I absolutely love this movie. I first saw it when I was young and I must watch it once every four months. It gets better every time I watch it, and I pick up on things. First off, the story sets itself up to be suspenseful, and one wrong turn could have ruined that. But Shyamalan knew better back then. He teases the audience with suspense, showing us something very quickly, or in the corner of our eye. He knows what he's doing, and it works perfectly. The acting in this movie is phenomenal, and many scenes move me to tears every time I watch it. The direction and writing is amazing, there is a couch scene where Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix have a ten minute conversation, and it holds you so deeply. SPOILERS Lots of people who saw this movie didn't like it because they were expecting a horror movie. THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE. This is a moving, emotional, suspense movie that is focused on story, acting, cinematography. This is an amazing movie if you can appreciate those things. It's not an Independence Day movie, and thank gosh for it. This movie focuses on one family and puts you through the emotions and fears that they are feeling. I repeat, an amazing movie all together. Another thing that annoys me is people are always talking about how stupid it was that water killed the aliens. People are always saying, why did the aliens come to earth if it's covered in water? Okay, maybe the aliens had never come into contact with water before and didn't know it could harm them. Or maybe they did know, but earth was the only planet around with the kind of resources they needed. The movie's not about the aliens anyway, it's about a man regaining his faith. Watch this movie with those thoughts in mind and you may have a different response than you did before.",Signs

Unfortunately, he didn't learn much else from the master of suspense. Perhaps if he would have hired a realwriter instead of penning this boring script himself, it would have been more interesting. Somehow his press agents have got the spin going that he's afantastic director and writer. He obviously believes this and wants to make sure we know this crap is all his fault-- his name appears so many times in theopening and closing credits and in such a large typeface, the local zoning board wants me to get a sign permit before playing the DVD again. And, not todisappoint us with his bad script and repetitive camera angles, he cast himself in a pivotal role. Couldn't he afford a character actor?

I must admit, I had been intrigued by the trailers - looked like a good old fright-from-outer-space picture to me. It isn't, though - more's the pity.""Signs"" does employ a few time-honoured tools of the genre - inexplicable phenomena (corn circles - could have been a good hook), the fact that you don't really see the creatures until quite late, and the classic situation of it all happening to (or at least centring on) a lonesome farmstead, all these are classic devices.But what comes along in this garb is not actually an alien-shocker sort of film, but rather a drama of spiritual rediscovery (potted: Cleric loses wife, as a consequence loses faith, but it turns out her last words as well as some of the action in the film preceding the finale can be interpreted as divine predetermination/intervention, and badabing-badaboom: he rediscovers his faith). Quite apart form the fact that I'm personally not likely to be impressed by challenge-to-faith storylines (unless done in manners as excellent as ""Dead Man Walking""), I think this is what spoiled the film for me: trying to both spiritually challenging and suspenseful, it fails on both counts.As to the first: the alien invasion is not plotted well enough to make the viewer really interested. We don't know why they come (or where they come from), we do not get to know anything about their greater strategies, and most of all, we do not get a satisfying bust-up at the end (someone found a way to repeal them, apparently - that's all we are told. And there's a scene in which an alien is vanquished by the judicious use of a baseball bat and tap-water - effective, maybe, but hardly riveting. ""independence Day"" - need I say more? Not a film I find intellectually interesting, but then, so few of the alien take-over genre are). Of course I am aware of the fact that the invasion is incidental to the film's main theme, the vicar's return to the godhead - rather like the murder in Gosford Park - but a) the trailer should have given me an idea of that and b) that storyline is beset with problems of its own.Actually, for me at least, its really only one problem: its too pat to be in any way engaging. At the centre of the picture, a dialogue scene is used to introduce a dualist view of humanity: those who believe in predetermination, and those who believe in the essential randomness of life. The film then continues to integrate disparate occurrences (from the dead wife's last words to a child's bad habit of leaving half-empty water glasses standing around) into the parson's final revelation that God must exist because why else would it all make sense in the final instance. Unfortunately, it's all too glib for my taste - where's the spiritual challenge? Getting over a loved one's death has been done better before. Not to mention the fact that the central dialogue mentioned is unbelievably trite, theologically about as sophisticated as a penny catechism, and geared towards an audience of the literalist kind with a Manichean world-view (dare I say US American at this point?) - and not towards anyone with a shred of interest in the psychological machinations of fitting a disastrous event into an essentially optimistic religious world view.Failing both as a suspenseful and technically interesting exercise in the alien invasion genre and as an exploration of crise de foi, I cannot recommend this film - watch it when your flatmate/partner rents it, but don't rent it yourself.",Signs

I saw it again tonight on a pay-per-view channel, and I see it more clearly now. This film goes straight into my personal favourite top three films of all-time.Basically it's about a family trying to come to terms with grief. They have lost their mother, and Mel Gibsons charactor has lost a wife he obviously loved deeply.Whilst they are trying to get back to some sort of normality, they discover a huge crop circle in their backyard. Strange occurrances happen, and it turns out to be an alien invasion!What makes this film unique is that the action revovles around this one family and how things effect them. Will the father figure be able to snap himself out of his grief to be able to look after his family, or will the aliens win?All the charactors are fully fleshed out. We learn in flashbacks how the wife and mother died, and everyhting is observed in an inteligent manner.

This movie is basically a boring religion oriented family drama with little to offer if you're waiting for a quality sci-fi story. The word 'sign' is literally used to give a moral lesson such that anything that happens on earth is a sign that god exists and everything depends on fate. And aliens are just for adding some spice to the story. it was totally a waste of time for me. BTW: i gave 2 points instead of 1 just for the sake of acting.

1233,Foxhound199,Earth is being invaded! Everyone grab a bat!,5,11 August 2004,"Some minor spoilage is contained herein.Perhaps it is a testament to M. Night Shyamalan that he can put us on the edge of our seats over nothing at all. In ""Signs"", he masterfully creates strong suspense inspired by a not-so-strong antagonist. When we think of hostile aliens invading Earth, we may picture such scenarios as ""War of the Worlds"", or some other variation of the ""death-ray toting, destroy all human life"" scheme. ""Signs"" decides to take a different approach. But never fear; what these aliens lack in sophisticated technology, they more than make up for in navigational ability. Crop circles, of course, are not elaborate hoaxes, but actually road maps for alien invaders. From what facts can be gathered in the movie, they roughly translate to ""Attack somewhere around here"". In movies such as ""Independence Day"", the aliens wisely began by destroying major population centers such as New York and L.A. The effect of their elaborate crop beacons in ""Signs"" seems to be to direct invaders to small farmhouses across the world. I don't want to pretend that I'm smarter than an alien, but perhaps there are better indicators of major population centers than crop circles (Hint: Look for the big bright lights).The point of my seemingly incessant rambling is to note that this movie lacks believable baddies. From our very first glimpse of the aliens in a very bigfootesque home video, we almost want to laugh at them.

Plenty of people who lack a belief in God have trashed this film because it causes the viewer to consider what they think about faith.  I find their reaction to this theme rather sad.  I think that the fact that the film makes a statement about faith and asks you to decide where you stand on it is one of its strong points.The film basically has four main characters, a family which comes under an extreme amount of stress during an alien invasion.  The acting and chemistry between them was top notch.  I was especially impressed by the children. The supporting cast was also very good.  I though that the use of the television news reports to advance the plot made the story seem real and made it very interesting.  When you consider all of the reporting that went into covering the military campaign in Iraq you have to wonder how the news media would cover an alien invasion.Note in defense of the aliens:You will enjoy this film more if you are capable of remembering it is a film and not a representation of what an alien invasion would be like.  You will enjoy it if you accept the aliens the way that they are instead of holding them up to your preconceived notions of what a good invader should be like.

This movie has been tagged as a ""Mel Gibson movie,"" or an ""Alien Movie."" Neither are accurate. Signs is a movie about a man that has lost his faith through some of life's unfortunate turn of events. His family struggles to cope with the loss of their mother and their father's loss of faith. Sometimes when a person loses all faith, it takes some great event or miracle to turn him or her around, and in this case, its aliens. This is, in my opinion, M. Night Shyamalan's best picture to date, and one of the better films made in the last decade. This is not a big budget special effects picture, and if fact, you hardly see the aliens at all. This movie is suspenseful and downright eerie at times, helped along mostly by Howard's wonderful score. Signs is as creepy as your mind will allow it to be, and on top of that is as much a spiritual odyssey as it is an eerie movie you should watch at night with the surround sound up and the lights off.

I would first of all disagree with this statement I think it strikes the right balance of sci-fi and religion, and even if the scales tip in favour of the religious elements, why would that be bad? There are plenty of sci-fi films, the skew on this film towards religion, in my opinion, builds the suspense.I think the themes are interwoven very skillfully the writing is superb, fresh, funny, suspenseful, you get a real sense of danger in this family. What I like most about Night is that he manages to make things real. I genuinely believed the film and I think that is because the film is not about saving the world, its about saving our faiths and beliefs, and about destiny and...signs. It's focused on a family that are going through trouble much like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, and this makes the story real and the characters more likable.In any case its business as usual from Night, visually its stunning, it has some scary moments, some very funny moments, and in general is very touching.

The head of the committee says to the presenter you are a moron that's why you aren't on the committee. Yes water will kill us but worms are icky. I hate worms. Nothing in the movie makes any sense.

I was so into the aliens that I didn't notice how stupid the ending was. Wasn't it a little far-fetched for that alien who got his hand cut up by Mel Gibson to come back for revenge on the family? That totally made me rethink how good of a movie it was. Also, the movie is similar to M. Night's previous two because it is very slow moving and takes a while to develop. It also cannot be ignored that water plays a big role in this movie, much like that of Unbreakable. The more I see of this movie, the more I realize how stupid it was. It can be enjoyable because there are laughs and there are some scary scenes. Overall I would give it a 3/5.",Signs

The fact that aliens with an ""agua allergy"" would come to a planet that is 2/3 water populated by 'humans' who are also 2/3 water shows that either the aliens, or the film maker, was completely out to lunch. Since the aliens don't really exist... Swing Away... Half-a-wife... the director playing the part of ""hey I'm a dazed guy in a truck""... God's against them and for us (the human race)... and on and on... The magic of movies allows this one to suck AND blow at the same time. I would rather watch my Uncle Chuck's vacation videos.

It tries to be a tense and suspenseful horror, while trying to maintain a spoof-like attitude towards 50s B-movies... and for the large part it succeeds.Though this film was advertised and branded as a horror you have to appreciate it as comedy if you want to enjoy it... Certain characters and actions as laugh out loud funny, and i think this is very intentional. The weird army man. The way uncle Meryl acts in places, and the tin foil on the head thing... (something which Scary Movie 3 missed the mark spoofing... because it was a joke in the first place) However in places the film seems stuck between the horror and comedy genres ad doesn't know where it wants to be, and you'll notice this scenes because they seem very awkward My suggestion is you enjoy this as a film that takes the mick out of old sci-fis but is also suspenseful in its own right.

Signs is no exception.The writing is amateurish, predictable and cloying. The conflicts are superficial, the character flaws and inevitable redemption are hollow and contrived.And the menace, the alien menace, is laughable. Two dimensional characters, they might as well be zombies or simple thugs.They have traveled across the vastness of space, to a planet whose surface is composed mainly of water. They cavort naked around in the humid air, through dew damp fields of corn, barefoot on the damp ground. They fly space ships but dig in the wet soil with their hands and.... buh buh buh baaaaaa!!!!

1251,cjp-10,"Not M. Night Shyamalan's finest, but good.",7,29 May 2005,"On the surface, Signs is an alien movie where the human race comes to contact with a foreign life form. Signs might have had a rather large budget, but it doesn't make it a big Hollywood spectacle. This means that there isn't a lot of scenes with the aliens nor does the scenery change much from the farmhouse that the family of Mel Gibson's character Graham Hess lives in. This is intentional.The reason for this is simple: Signs is really about family, faith and coincidence. It is clear that M. Night Shyamalan is a man of vision and good taste. As scenes with aliens are scarce, every glimpse of the invaders has a bigger impact. Signs isn't about cheap shots with well placed stingers or visual horror, but relies on its haunting atmosphere that is created by the uncertainty regarding the aliens. Not until the very end does the viewer begin to learn the first things about the invaders. For me, this worked very well and kept me interested throughout the film. However, some viewers will find Signs boring for this very reason.If the film hadn't been directed by M. Night Shyamalan, I doubt that Sign's would have turned out as good as it did. As the film contains a few dramatic scenes, it comes very close to being corny or cheesy, but Shyamalan manages to pull it off.So why only 7 points? Well, to tell you the truth I can't think of a reason why I didn't like it more. Sixth Sense totally blew me away, so expectations were naturally high on this one. 7 points is definitely not bad and there certainly isn't anything wrong with the film. Signs is just one of those movies that are ""OK"" and you can't really explain it. I found a lot of good in it, but maybe that just wasn't good enough.",Signs

I feel as if this movie gets a bad rap because of the religious side of it, but let me just say if you are religious or not I believe you should watch this movie. Another complaint was the look of the alien but they aren't in it that much and it doesn't distract from the action much either.

The script was very well written and acted out by the cast. There was excellent interaction between all members of the cast, and no scene appeared stilted or contrived. I was intrigued by the cameo role in the movie by Mr. Shyamalan himself; the fact that he didn't portray a ""good ol' boy"" in the rural town lent to the air of suspicion surrounding his character. The range of emotions that Mel and his ""family"" displayed were executed believably, and was the main (although far from ONLY) ingredient to the overall excellence of the movie.The script was so well written, the acting by the cast so believable, and the cinematography so precisely executed, that I felt I was literally transported in time and space to the farm, sensing deep within myself, scene by scene, the entire range of emotions that the family went through. Rod Serling and Alfred Hitchcock were excellent mystery writers, but this work by M. Night Shyamalan surpasses them all. Thank you, Mr. Shyamalan, for an excellent, believable story!",Signs

Your never gonna sit down to a Night movie and predict everything that will happen after the first 10 minutes. He will always keep you guessing and you will NEVER guess right. I give complete props to a writer/director who is not afraid to do something different.I didn't catch on to him until after I saw the Sixth Sense, then I went back and watched Unbreakable. I loved them both. Later when The Village came out I was surprised by how much bashing it took. I loved it. I love it because it was original and it made you think. Signs does the same thing. It's not just a alien movie. It has a huge story other then the aliens. You are brought into the lives of the father and his family and you understand them and why they feel they way they do.

1258,dgeiser13,Inspired Filmmaking,7,4 August 2002,"As with his previous films, The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, Signs is the ultimate one-man show, written, produced and directed by its creator, M. Night Shyamalan. It's a great, creep-fest of a film and easily the best film of 2002 (that I've seen) to date. Shyamalan proves himself again with an incredibly taut script and innovative direction. Focusing on a very small group of people, the family unit, while still retaining some diversity of characters is inspired. The slow and deliberate pacing makes you feel like we're never out of touch with the characters, except for a few minutes here or there, during the few days we spend with them. He allows bits and piece of characterization to reveal themselves as the plot plays out and to relieve the tension, which is ratcheted higher, in this movie, then most thrillers ever dream of reaching, he uses copious amounts of well-timed humor. Probably more than anything I came away from the film thinking how funny it was. I'll also give him extra kudos for having the presence of mind to cast himself as an (ultimately?) unlikeable character in a movie filled with real, likeable and honest people. Choices like that are real gutsy ones and, when you pair them with the zeal that he shows for innovative filmmaking, you can see why his continued success seems boundless.

In ""E.T."" we've already seen someone running through a dark corn field, holding a flashlight, looking for the extra-terrestrial. We've already seen common people preparing for the historical encounter with aliens in ""Close Encounters"" and in many other films.  We've already seen the aliens hover above the world's main cities in ""Independence Day"" and alike.  So why does Shyamalan repeat these scenarios in such a boring fashion???If he want's to show that ""anything Spielberg can do, I can do better"", well, he can't.In ""The Sixth Sense"" he had a great original idea. In ""Unbreakable"" the idea wasn't that great, but at least it was original. ""Signs"" brings the promising director/writer to a sad low-point.It is a conservative, righteous and annoying story about a father and his son.

1260,Moppet,The Sign of a great movie.,8,5 August 2002,"I went to see Signs opening day and have to say it exceeded my expectations. Mel Gibson, who at no point plays a leader of an oppressed group, plays the role of a former Reverend who has left the church after his wife dies in a car accident.  Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job playing Gibson's brother and has a great comic timing and delivery.  The children actors were great and the little girl will make you sigh and laugh at her innocence.This movie differs from M. Night's previous two movies in that there is much more comedic dialogue.  It felt at some point that M. Night had watched a lot of Aaron Sorkin's West Wing because of some of the back and forth interaction between Gibson and Phoenix.However, FOR ALL THOSE LOOKING FOR A SCI-FI THILLER... THIS IS NOT ONE!!!!! It is full of suspense and has many tense moments but like all of M. Night's movies, the main story is not the actual events happening (crop circles, aliens, etc.).  It is the character development as he/she is affected and reacts to the events in the story.I cannot for the life of me, understand why those who have seen M. Night's movies before expected Signs to be a sci-fi thriller and be disappointed when it MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better than a mindless sci-fi movie about alien invasion (though, they can be fun as well).  With this movie M. Night has solidified the fact that he is one of the only director's of our time that understands that great characters make a great movie.  Not special effects!",Signs

Although the movie starts out with great promise, having us believe that we're actually going to find out some facts we didn't already know, the movie digresses into yet another horror flick.  The final blow is the ending that has a stuntman in an alien suit breaking into a boarded up house and attacking the humans inside.  This movie does not live up to the expections and all the hype. The only thing good that can be said about it is that at least the majority of crop glyphs appearing are attributed to extraterrestrials and not human hoaxers.  But since such a mockery is made of the alien connection, one can only conclude that all crop circles must be the work of very skilled hoaxers.

I wholly trusted that the Director of Unbreakable and the Sixth Sense would lead me through another great suspenseful story and he certainly delivered!M. Night knows how to build suspense using mood, music and cinematography. Some of the devices used to create tension and foreshadowing are brilliant. He also seems to be able to coax great performances from his actors.I was a bit worried that having Mel Gibson as the lead would be distracting (he looks too familiar), but this was not a problem.The only downside of this movie experience for me (and yes - it was an experience) is that afterwards, some things don't add up.  For the first time in an M. Night film I thought that he ""cheated"".

His next movie went down from there, but was no slouch ""Unbreakable"".  However, this movie was, in a word ""disappointing"".  Sham a Lam also makes the mistake of starring in his own movie.  His acting is very ""wooden"".  He should not do this again. Looking for some originality from Sham a Lam was something I looked forward to.  He had done so well with ""The Sixth Sense"".  The only thing I noticed was that he used a lot of shadow in his lighting.  Many scenes just showed half a face.  His flashlight tricks in the movie were a rip off from ""Blair Witch"". Mel Gibson plays a minister who has left his church for the past 6 months. He has given up on God, because his wife died in a car accident.  He has two kids, about ages 8 and 4.  His oldest child is a son, played by Rory Caulkin.  That's right, another Caulkin - like we needed that.  He looks and sounds just like McCauley (his brother, think ""Home Alone""), at his age. Mel's brother is played by an actor that I loathe, Joaquin Phoenix. Although, he wasn't that bad in this movie. Crop circles are popping up all over the world, in a manner that is too fast to be a hoax.  Then alien spaceships show up, sort of like in ""Independence Day"".  No one is sure if they are here to take over, or just to observe.  The aliens are only able to be detected by dogs.  They are also very fast, and can jump at least 10 feet in the air.  Scientists seem to believe that the crop circles are like points on a map to tell future aliens where to land. Mel and his family make a last stand at their house.  They board up all their windows and try to hold out against the aliens.  The main thing that I found wrong with this movie is that the pace in many parts is excruciatingly SLOW.  Mel and his brother have a confrontation at the end of the movie with one of the aliens.  Again, I question Sham a Lam here.  The look of the alien was not original at all.  For those of you that remember ""Marshall, Will, and Holly - on a routine expedition"" from the 70's Saturday morning television show ""Land of the Lost"", it is basically a Sleestak.

No wait, that was The Patriot. Aliens -- it's aliens this time.That's part of the movie's point -- it's not really *about* an alien invasion. ""The aliens were a Macguffin,"" my wife pronounced as we left the theater. Like he did in Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, MNS uses the supernatural as an occasion to examine the human condition.
One of the early shots in the farmhouse shows a blank spot on the wall where a crucifix once was. Hess (Gibson's character) is an ex-minister who has suffered tragedy in his family and turned his back on God. The appearance of crop circles in his backyard, the signs of the coming alien invasion -- they're occasions for Hess to ask himself, ""does everything happen for a reason?"" Anyone who's had someone close to them die has asked the same question. They've probably also had people tell them that everything, including death, does happen for a reason. That gives some people comfort, and makes other people angry. Hess is angry at God. (""I hate you!"" he yells at one point when another family member's life is threatened, and it's clear Whom he's addressing). While the Test of Faith movie has been made many times, Signs is about Hess's Test of Faithlessness.(Incidentally, we saw this right after renting ""Serendipity"", which asks the same question in romantic-comedy mode. Coincidence? I don't think so....)The acting, by the way, is great. There are a couple of moments where Gibson breaks out of the strong-silent-suffering mask -- one where he confronts MNS's character, another at a family dinner  -- that are really powerful. Cherry Jones deserves a Two Minute Oscar for her role as the local cop. And the kids are really quite good. (Abigail Breslin as the daughter reminded me of Drew Barrymore in ET and Heather O'Rourke in Poltergeist.)Don't go into this movie expecting Independence Day. Or even expecting The Sixth Sense.

Night Shyamalan is an extraordinarily talented director, the cinemetography and performances in this film were excellent.  MNS creates some genuinely creepy sequences.  But, please!!!  The surprise ending to which this film builds is so hoaky, contrived, and inane that I felt my intelligence had been insulted.  I have never seen so much talent (not only that of MNS, but also of Gibson, Phoenix, and the kids) thrown at such a lousy script.  I admire MNS's efforts to create ambience and I appreciate a *good* surprise ending as much as anyone, but this was simply too forced and sophomoric to be swallowed.  Any ""surprise"" ending which hinges on so many contingencies & coincidences and requires SO MANY expository asides and monologues to be established really should be scrapped.  People seem to really enjoy this turkey, and in all fairness it is artfully done and worth a view, but I would definitely rate it a rental or wait to catch it on cable.",Signs
1276,fillbert_speed,"Good, but not great",6,3 August 2002,"My sense of excitement and giddy anticipation slowly went flat through out this film. Although Shayamalan is a master at building suspense by letting the imagination run wild this film just dose not deliver at the end.  He builds up the tension to unbearable levels and then just eases up at such a gentle pace it is almost anti-climatic. I was expecting some type of plot twist at the end, like in ""The Sixth Sense"", but was sorely disappointed when it failed to deliver. All in all it was worth the price of a student admission, and I will probably go see it again to pick up on all the little details that I might of missed.",Signs
1277,jbyersjr,A mercifully short movie,4,17 August 2002,"Although it may seem longer, Signs commendably wastes only 106 minutes of your time. It's also a shameful waste of Mel Gibson's talents -- unless you find pleasure in viewing Mel's face constantly filling the screen, wearing a constipated expression that's presumably intended to convey extreme concern. Weak plot, negligible character development, oh-hum action shots, and senseless inconsistencies add up to a major disappointment.",Signs

The answers to both questions remain elusive, but Shyamalan leads us down a valuable pathway in this eternal search.The strong direction brings out compelling characters, as expressed by a superior cast. Cherry Jones is fantastic. For that matter, so are Gibson, Phoenix and the rest.Signs is NOT a B-movie, and it is NOT an action movie. It is NOT even a sci-fi movie per se. Rather, it presents a grieving family in the face of an existential crisis (or two, actually). This movie speaks to life's most basic questions with emotion and clarity.It does not compete with Aliens (which I also loved) or Independence Day in any way at all.

The film has a Blair Witch type feel in that the menace is felt but not seen (for the majority of the movie)which works really well. I for one gripped the sides of my seat thought large portions of the movie! What doesn't work is the sudden reversal in the plot to dovetail in with the various strands in the story and connect this to Mel's restoration in his faith.  It just doesn't work and leaves you feeling short changed when you leave the cinema.  I almost felt the film would have worked better if it ended in the cellar when the lights went out, at least the outcome would then have been left to the viewers imagination.

If the audience consisted of pod people, it might have worked.  Suffice to say Hollywood is anti-gun, pro-Bible belt, and anti-dog.  Two dogs get killed in the movie, both in a fairly horrid fashion.The acting in Signs is so terrible that my first reaction was that this was another `pod person' movie, and all our main characters had been taken over by aliens.

It attempted to deal with a few concepts e.g. everything happens for a reason, but the way the movie presented them was fairly obvious.Although, it was quite scary and the actors did a really good job in showing real fear, but the seriousness was often alleviated by humorous youthful stories from the younger brother.

1285,frederick-jon,!!Movie Spoliers & Unusual Theory!!,7,20 January 2003,"SINCERE APOLOGIES, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. Firstly and foremost the hype surrounding Signs did not live up to the reality. I left the cinema with no definitive feeling!. The performances were good, especially the youngsters, and the film itself was intriguing from the point of view that you were waiting for something to happen. But in the end nothing happens and I felt a little let down.I put myself under the impression that a big crescendo was building and unfortunately, this was a mistake. I did however enjoyed the movie but, only afterward when I believed what the theory was behind the film (maybe). Hence the spoilers as opposed to a review.Here's the Spoilers!!!! (May I just add, that I do not, under normal circumstances, appreciate spoilers. One of the most wonderful commodities of film is that is can be want you want it to be and therefore I do apologise for providing spoilers, but on this film an exception is made!)My interpretation of Signs was that I was watching Independence Day from a sideward view! - A story that tells how one small family in a remote part of the US, not to far from a major US city, dealt with an invasion of Aliens!!Evidence forthwith.The director, Mr Shyamalan (who without any doubt is a very talented director), has crafted a well constructive thought provoking film that has certainly produced an abundance of healthy discussion.OK evidence and Spoilers to my theory! (May I just add I am no fan of Independence Day, nor have I seen the film many times, so please feel free to judge the evidence).* Signs was set over a 3-4 day period in the summer, 45 miles from Philadelphia. - Philadelphia was an initial prime target in ID (short for Independence Day from here on in).* The first telling evidence was the aerial shot of India. We see multiple areas (major cities) where the UFO's or corn circles are stationed. This interpretation is down to the viewer. - In ID a similar shot was used depicting the aliens above the US.* Signs makes continued references to the visitors being either hostile or friendly? It's 50/50, black or white...which one are you? - In ID some believe the visitors to be friends some do not.* I would say that the climax of the movie depicts the Aliens, albeit inconclusively (I Agree), as hostile. - This is fairly clear in ID.* The (saucer shaped) UFO's start to appear over many cities in the world - and they just seem to hang over them motionlessly for a couple days seemly doing nothing.  - This again is clear and very similar to the events in ID.* A baby monitor is used in Signs as the family discovery of codes being transmitted. - Televisions come to mind for ID.* In Signs its mentioned that these codes may refer to a possible countdown to an invasion/or other!. - Goldblum discovers this in ID.* Signs makes reference of the use of hand to hand combat. (Armies) - In ID Will Smith gives us a Birdseye view of them.* When confined to the Basement: Merrill mentions that the radio transmission states that the Aliens have started to leave and that many people have been killed. - Part of the plot in ID.* Then for me, the clincher: The TV broadcast at the end (near end anyhow) of the film mentions that the Aliens had been defeated with the help of an old fashion form of communication (Morse code?) that originated out of the Middle East. - The woeful ending we are giving in ID.What makes me more convinced of this, is why would a talented and intelligent director as M. Night Shyamalan make a film about aliens with so many (arguably) similarities to a recently poor movie about aliens?There are numerous indiscretions, agreed. Like the water causing damage to the aliens (the Wizard of Oz perhaps!). But I see Signs told from the characters perspective of how they defended there small part of the world in the midst of confusion. Hence the visual differences.In which case I summarise by saying that I believe the director has had a little fun with this movie and I found it to be more of a comedy then a thriller. This is Independence Day told from an alternative perspective.
For me this makes the film original and I take my hat off to that. But this is far from a great!",Signs
1286,Max1013,Shama-lama-ding-dong,6,6 August 2002,"I was utterly disappointed after seeing ""Signs.""  M. Night Shyamalan has captivated me in the past with his creative wit and intriguing stories. This story is neither original nor is it very intriguing.  The scenes seemed very choppy and did not flow together well.  There were some great comedic scenes and the actors were fine.  Unfortunately, the story they were in just wasn't as interesting as their characters, whom we learn almost nothing about.  I kept waiting to find out more about the characters, especially Joaquin Phoenix's character - but it was not to be.  The end was abrupt and seemed like the writer ran out of paper or something and just decided to end the film.  It was a great jump-out-of-your-seat, spooky movie, but that's pretty much it.  M.

The director has made one good movie I know of (""The Sixth Sense""), but his follow-up efforts were not particularly outstanding -- which means they should stop trying to entice people to go and watch his other movies.

1289,yeti-28,much credit for a fantastic movie,9,9 August 2008,"Recently viewing the votes for this particular movie have shown it to be at a 7 of 10, which is FAR too low. to be honest, many of my friends I speak with, tell me that director M. Night Shyamalan is a ""sham"" and an overall bad director, but they could not be more wrong. Although many of his more famous works (signs, the village, etc...) seem to rely upon the suspense that builds up the climax of the movie, which may make younger or 'less intelligent' persons to become quickly uninterested, it is within this style that he shines. for example, multiple scenes in the movie would show Mel Gibson in some scary and harrowing situation, (I:E: in the abandoned house with the alien trapped in the pantry), where you the viewer KNOWS that someone or something is watching him, possibly even on the verge of the attack. unlike the cheap and cliché-riddled, quote-un-quote ""horror movies"" produced today, signs departs from said cheap-theatrics, and think; the thought being utilized here, :what will happen next? it is what the viewer cannot see, that the should and do fear. Also, many little messages and morals can be received throughout the movie, one such example: Don't give up hope or faith. All things considered, signs is a rocking good time, that plays out like Jaws, but with a classic Hitchcock ending. Enjoy.",Signs

1291,Q-Panic,simple but good,8,25 July 2002,"I was actually surprised by the movies' courage for clichés and quotations. I was expecting something new somehow but ""sings"" ist ""just"" a tribute to all those old 50s alien invasion b-movies. And it's NOT about the struggle of Hess' spiritual life. Maybe Shyamalan wanted the movie to be about that but in that point he failed. I even thought that the backflashes (*spoiler*: to his wife's accident) where useless, disturbed the rhythm and were the weakest part of the script in general.And don't expect that the secret (like the trailer promised) of the crop circles is going to revealed. The movie just gives a stupid theory (which is completely unbelievable and just a guess...). The crop-circles however aren't even the ""signs"" which refer to the title. That was just a fake. Shyamalan actually means ""spiritual signs"" (e.g. coincidences which just cannot be coincidence...) but the ""sings"" he uses in this movie are not convincing and therefore the (spoiler warning!!!) change from faithless ex-father to faithful Reverend isn't convincing either. I even was a little annoyed by it since I count myself to the ""first kind of people"" and I am not really filled with fear...Anyway. The suspense is great. Shyamalan uses his now well-known style of ""simplicity"". You often hear more than you see. And that works perfectly. It shows that you don't need big special effect to create suspense.The story is weak, has some really really deep plotholes but it carries the character through it. Mostly because of the actors (especially the little ones) who give a nice performance.I found ""sings"" entertaining and thrilling. The subplot (for me is the subplot the spiritual search of Hess and not vice versa!) was a very good idea but it would have been better to raise another question: do you fall back into praying and believing when you life gets threaten and you think the world could end? Is that true faith? But the movie avoids those question. You can see from the very beginning that Shyamalan is a person who believes in miracles.Overall: far better than most of the summer-block-busters. And even better than Panic Room (comparing the thrill-factor). And for sure the best X-Files episode ever. (:I would gave it: 7 or 8 out of 10",Signs
1292,sspence-1,"Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs.....",8,3 August 2002,"*May contain SPOILERS*I would have to disagree with the previous posting with regard to M. Night Shyamalan's newest venture starring the wonderful Mel Gibson.  I have seen all three of his films and I enjoyed all.  A few things I think that deserve to be mentioned are mostly directing and producing techniques that Mr. Shyamalan used this time around.  The Sixth Sense was accented with shades of red.  When something important was happening (a sweatshirt, a doornob, etc.), an item on screen signaled ever so subtly that this scene was important to the plot of the film.  In Unbreakable, Mr. Shyamalan used a lot of colors also, but mostly shades of purple, which has always been related to royalty and essentially, related to good.  Whether clothes or wrapping paper or anything else, purple was a significant sign.I noticed tonight, at the late show viewing of Signs, that our writer, director, producer didn't use color as much in this film.  I believe his intentions were to use light as a way of speaking to the viewer.  Whether a flashlight, or going between changing a room from dark and light, or through lights shining through windows. The next thing I want to mention is how Shyamalan reflects in his films his obvious respect for Hitchcock.  Notice during the credits.  Notice the music.  It is very apparent and, I thought, very obvious.  Another point, Mr. Shyamalan always has himself in his films at least as a small part. Although he has thus far had larger roles than Alfred Hitchcock gave himself, he has include his face in his films. My favorite aspect of signs was that there was a hot and a cold.  One is either very intense, on the edge of one's seat; or one is laughing out loud.",Signs

If they say ""yes"", or even ""it was pretty good."" I tend to like that person. To me, if someone likes or dislikes this movie it says something about their personality. It's like there is a psychological profile embodied throughout the movie and when people watch it there is a varying quality of likes and dislikes inherent in the viewers. More so for this movie then any other movie I have seen. It seems extreme but there is something about this movie that sets it apart from anything I have ever seen.

That was okay back in the 70s but after having grown up with Star Trek and Star Wars not to mention a whole lot of other movies that graphically illustrate every kind of alien imaginable I would have to say the mystique is gone for good.  Mel Gibson was excellent as always and I found myself laughing at some of the words coming out of the little girl that plays his daughter.

After reading some of the other reviews that said Signs is not a good movie I had to see it, knowing that these people are the same people that can not watch a movie without gross-out humor and dazzling special effects. Signs is a brilliantly crafted movie which managed to keep me enthralled to the very last minute. Instead of using explosions, special effects and hundreds of CGI aliens, which are used in most movies to distract the viewer from the weak storyline, Shyamalan keeps the effects to a bare minimum and instead uses images and a feeling of isolation to keep viewers in suspense. Signs is NOT your typical Science Fiction movie because it goes much deeper by evaluating religion and instead of seeing the whole world in turmoil we see the whole invasion through the experiences of a family isolated on a farm. The performances are excellent. The story amazing and the movie SPECTACULAR. But be warned if you are narrow-minded and you are not stimulated by movies which make you think this isn't for you. If you are on the other hand one of those people who enjoys an amazing experience in a movie, see it now. Definitely a contender for the Oscars in 2003. Undoubtedly one of this years best movies.

This is a very good movie, without all the fast action special effects stuff. It's a real tribute to the old movies where you could scare, without actually showing anything, by just using lights and good acting. You can hear the scary things, you can see a clawed hand or see the blurry reflection of it on a television set.

1301,Jim_Hall,"""The Signs Of Life""",8,8 January 2007,"""Signs""Rating: PG-13 | for some frightening moments | Theatrical Release: 2002 | Runtime: 106 min.Critique: ""Signs"" relies heavily on symbolism and a belief that there are no coincidences. The film seems to be a montage of documentary, sci-fi, thriller, and even comedy since it has a bigger meaning than just sci-fi. It doesn't waste time to lose your interest; rather it immediately cuts to the chase when crop circles are discovered on the family farm. Don't you hate those movies that just drag along? I'm afraid this isn't a huge thriller. There are very few times that this movie actually scares you. There are some, don't get me wrong. M. Night Shyamalan mainly relies on mystery and suspense instead of actually facing fear up close and personal. Shyamalan is the kind of guy who doesn't want to use CGI if at all possible, and frankly I don't blame him. The aliens that are used are CGI, and they're pretty good, but that's not good enough. Even though Shyamalan decided to use CGI, I honestly don't think he should have. CGI hasn't managed to maintain a perfect form and at times it doesn't look real. Even though ""Signs'"" CGI is top grade, it's not perfect and it tends to deteriorate the movie slightly. Don't expect to see a lot of communication between outsiders and the family. They do manage to go into town, but Shyamalan wants us to focus on the family's characteristics and their problems of crop circles. We are thrown into their own fears while the majority of outside communication is beamed through the family television. ""Signs"" displays some values of faith in God and it uses that concept along with symbolism to clean house at the end of the movie. Overall if you have a taste for sci-fi and the art of symbolism, this movie's for you. *Audio 8/10: The audio is available in English and French Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. English subtitles for the hearing impaired are also presented. ""Signs"" has a nice little score that will keep you on your toes with the discomfort of a possible invasion. In many moments of the film you can hear a pen drop, a nice addition to bring the fear into your hearing senses.*Video 9/10: The video is presented in widescreen (1.85:1) for 16x9 televisions. Scene access and interactive menus are also available. The video is presented quite well, while beautiful farmland is shown in the filming locations of Pennsylvania. The colors are presented in a traditional and realistic way with dark colors, to show the mysterious terror of the family's problems. *Extras 9/10: We get more and then some. This film is packed with extras however no trailer or audio commentaries are provided. Deleted scenes, Night's first alien film and storyboards are available. His first alien film is quite dull and corny, but it gives us an excellent example of his determination to become a filmmaker. The most impressive extra is the six-part documentary by M. Night Shyamalan, exploring various concepts including the ideas that made it, to the marketing of the film. *Since studios release a variety of DVD editions: the audio, video, and extra reviews may be directed at one specific version.",Signs
1302,Spamquat,"Audience Participation Req'd, but not as you'd expect.",9,8 September 2002,"**Possible Mild Plot Spoilers Forthcoming** Many moviegoers are jaded today.  This has affected the way we see movies.  Not just our viewing habits, but actually the way we perceive the films themselves.  Horror is an incredibly mood dependent genre, and one difficult to accomplish without some measure of audience participation.
The expert craftsmanship of M. Night Shyamalan as a filmmaker is evident in this film's use of traditional horror elements, from the Hitchcock inspired credits and score, to the ""fake scare, now...jump!"" techniques, even paying homage to old B-style invasion movies with a genuinely creepy military officer in a minor role providing some exposition while echoing other marines with similarly angular haircuts.  With all of these elements, his direction takes and uses time honored traditions, and adds his own brand of magic, to save the movie from descending into camp, and to give a meaningful message to transcend a genre that has been done many times before.If a viewer walks into this film believing they can't be frightened by it, they are right, and I pity them.  The power of belief is a strong theme in this movie, that filmgoers would do well to recognize.  Accepting the film's reality is essential to relating to the situations, and experiencing fear.  Other reviewers comment on the ""unrealistic"" physical weakness of the Intruders, failing to notice that the film establishes them as physically no more powerful than a little boy.  If this easily dispelled ""error"", or the Christian elements involving a man in a crisis with his faith which are in line with his established character, have gotten in the way; then the viewer has missed something.  The opportunity to enjoy a horror movie made ""like they don't make 'em anymore"", flavored by a brilliant modern director is worth a small leap of faith.",Signs

1304,compman86,"This movie tried to be too many things at once, and each aspect was poorly done",1,20 August 2002,"Signs had so much potential, but it really disappointed me when I went to see it. The movie tried to inject humor, science fiction, thrill, and drama all into one plot. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was done very poorly.The humor wasn't that bad, and I laughed at most of the jokes. However, there were jokes at suspenseful moments and it would just ruin the mood. However, humor wasn't the biggest shortcoming of this film. It was just out of place.The science fiction aspect of the movie was horrible. They spent the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the movie developing the suspense and mystery of the crop circles and then...***SPOILER***...they ended up being for navigation? How lame is that? I think most of the people there wanted to see a more interesting reason for them. The aliens were also done very poorly. They tried to build suspense by only showing parts of their bodies, but that didn't really make me all that apprehensive. Eventually when they showed the whole body, the alien was incredibly stereotypical. Skinny and green.The thrill part of the movie consisted of purely hollywood cheap thrills. Sudden music with sudden camera changes with something new. Yes, it made me jump. Then, I swear, I started laughing my butt off in the movie theater. It was just so simply stupid. A real thriller is psychological which makes you not be able to fall asleep when you get home.The drama part was done poorly too. The biggest short coming in my opinion was that you never really became attached to the characters.
The whole thing with the ""signs"" being placed etc was to try to prove a philosophical idea. This wasn't done so badly, however, they basically told the audience ""Some people believe in God and fate, and others don't."" Usually, when a movie comes out which tries to make you believe something different, it comes up with something new that most people haven't thought of. Since the idea was so unoriginal and shallow, all of the work done to develop the signs etc was a waste of time.In conclusion, I went into the theater hoping to see something which made me think in different ways like A.I. and other science fiction border of reality movies do, but instead, I left wishing I didn't spend the $6.00 to see the movie (not to mention the $4.75 I paid for the popcorn which happened to not be that good that night, lol).",Signs
1305,alancaster,Signs of talent...,9,10 August 2002,"Ok, after just seeing this movie, I could go on & on about Shyamalan and how his work is welcomed like a breath of fresh air, especially amid these stupid teenager-partying/slasher insults. But I'll just get to the point and say that if you enjoy horror/suspense/sci-fi at all, and you liked Sixth Sense and/or Unbreakable, this movie is for you. It's creepy, it's cool, it's crafty and it's entertaining. It taps into a virtually untouched source of mystery and uses it to unleash one of the greatest films about close encounters since, well, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. But Shyamalan has this great sense of incorporating something freaky into a scene, and then not always providing the punchline for it. It leaves you a little unfulfilled and it's a good thing. Much like that scene in Sixth Sense when Cole gets locked in the little room at the top of the stairs and you know he gets attacked but you never really know who or what did it to him, or what really happened. The kids in Signs are very close to being believable and although Mel overacts as usual, the movie makes up for it with lots of dark corners and realistically creepy scenes. Two hours haven't flown by that fast in a long time...",Signs
1306,Jewels508,Great acting! (one isty-bitsy flaw),10,14 August 2002,"""Signs"" was excellent! I normally don't watch thrillers since I am scared to death afterwards, (this one was no exception...) but I am so glad I saw this movie. I just loved it! My best friend and I peeked through our hands during most of the more frightening parts, though. LOL! Everyone had excellent performances, especially Rory Culkin (Morgan). I will definitely see more of his movies! He is also a very cute kid, like his older brother, Macaulay. The ending could have been better, it was a little too sappy for me. I enjoyed Shyamalan's other movie -""The Sixth Sense"" ending more. It was a thriller, though it had some very humorous moments too. EVERYONE laughed during the part when Graham comes into the living room to find his two children and brother with tin foil hats that looked like big Hershey Kisses to me. LOL! I hope to see this movie again, though not in the theater (I'm broke). I know I will most surely rent it as soon as it comes out on DVD! Overall, ""Signs"" kicks @$$!",Signs

I rank it up with my favorite movies of all time. Joaquin Phoenix does an awesome job as Merrill Hess and Mel Gibson is the coolest priest I've ever seen. His character Grahm Hess rocked.

1313,starlet-uk,More than Sci-Fi,10,17 September 2002,"Most reviews of this have been mixed, and some seem to have missed the point.  Night has developed some similarities between his films now, e.g. the use of colour (Red- 6th Sense, Purple-Unbreakable, Blue- Signs). Here he makes his debut acting role as the Vet. Some say the inclusion of an Asian man in a film at this point in history is emphasising the problems people have with people of colour, since 9/11. I don't know about that, but go see this film if you want to watch a funny, intelligent, thought provoking films. I am not a big fan of Sci-Fi's so cannot tell you if this is a good one or a bad one. (Seeing a little less of the aliens may have been better.)The relationships in the film are executed perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix is very funny, showing another dimension to his acting. Don't go expecting to see Commodus or Toby N Tucker, or any of the others he plays. The kids are good actors. You believe they all are a family.The emotional scenes are very touching without being corny.

1314,craigkimball,Not very good,3,29 August 2002,"There are a number of problems with this film.  It is cheap, chose the wrong actors for the roles, and ultimately fails to deliver anything remotely scary or suspenseful.The storyline borrows heavily from other 'invasion' movies without adding anything new, it plods along hinting that something scary may happen when ultimately nothing does.  Essentially this is about 4 people in a house running from strange noises.The final scene is actually very funny. You finally see an alien (this showdown having been predictably set up during earlier scenes) and the way that this alien is dealt with is laugh out loud funny, although I am sure this was not the intention of the movie makers.Both myself, and all the people who watched this film with me thought it was a major turkey,  the only thing that stopped us leaving before it finished was my insistance that 'something good is about to happen', and didn't I look stupid after that.If you enjoyed Blair Witch then you will enjoy this, and I truly feel pity for you.",Signs
1315,nufan_78,I really wanted to like it,6,4 August 2002,"The best way to describe this movie is comparing it to a huge tease.  From beginning to......well.....the last ten minutes I was on the edge of my seat expecting to receive some kind of satisfaction in the end.  Without giving any spoilers away....lets just say you don't get that special reward at the end. The movie is intriguing and suspenseful almost through its entirety, but the missing piece at the end destroys what could have been a great film.  What happened to the creative spin Shyamalan put on his last two movies?  It's almost as if he had to come up with an ending in five minutes or he wouldn't meet deadline.

In trying to be both an action movie and a drama it failed at both. The character development isn't there for it to be a drama, and the action/suspense is too spread out to keep any interest there either. When I left the film I could think of only the term wishy-washy to describe what I had just seen. The acting tried hard to prove otherwise and the efforts turned in by the main characters was very good. However it appeared that the director had taken on much too much as a project in this film, and came out with bland underdeveloped characters, plot, and finally the entire movie. Save your money and don't believe the Hollywood hype for this film.",Signs
1317,sweetypie111,Wonderful except for the microphones,9,12 August 2002,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSI liked signs.  It was creepy, suspenseful and expertly crafted.  My only problem is that at least 4 times in the film you could see the microphone bobbing up and down above the actors.  Shyamalan must of been in a rush or something not to notice this.  Hopefully they will fix it for the DVD.I've been reading some of the comments here and I'm surprised so many people are complaining about the film.  Some have said that they didnt show enough of the aliens. I think they did show just enough because when you start seeing armies of obvious CGI it makes the film less believable. If you were expecting some epic alien vs earth battle then of course you would be disappointed with the film. The film isnt even about aliens. The title Signs is not even a reference to the crop circles it goes along with the theme of the movie that everything happens for a reason and there are no coincidences.  Someone also mentioned the children weren't realistic. I thought the kids were excellent. When the son kills the dog he isn't sobbing because he is in a state of shock. And for all the people complaining about the plot holes with the aliens you can't really call them plot holes because you don't know everything about this alien race so just let it go.  It's called willing suspension of disbelief. You can't enjoy a movie without it. I also liked the little funny moments during the movie.  It kept the movie from becoming unbearably intense.Overall Signs is worth your time.",Signs
1318,c_janack@yahoo.com,a bit heavy on the religious...,6,26 August 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan has again delivered a very watchable movie.  The actors performances were well done.  What did bother me was the bold assertion that superstitious people (IE: people who believe in miracles) are better prepared to handle adversity than rational people.  The movie is a good, old-fashioned, return to the horror movies of the fifties, portraying off-world aliens as monsters.  And the movie is fun on that level.  I just did not appreciate the heavy-handed religious message.  I get enough of that in the newspaper and on the radio every day.",Signs

1320,z0diac,An audience of low intelligence will LOVE it!,3,8 February 2003,"caution: possible spoiler(s) in this quick review.Ok, a race of aliens, so intelligent and technologically advanced that they can travel through the depths of space, come to earth and are thwarted in their attempt to break into a rural country house because the windows are boarded up.  And while they lay siege to planet Earth, the audience is given no information on why the governments and armies of the planet are just sitting idle.  But not to fear - the aliens came all the way to Earth so they could run around naked in the streets, unarmed (except for ""poison gas wrists""), and are easily defeated by water.  So what if the aliens are so intelligent that they can build space-travelling vessels.  If you're in danger, just lock one in your pantry.  Your alien visitor will spend days scratching its head in its failed attempts at escape.  If worst comes to worst - just add water.A COMPLETE lack of realism in this movie made it almost unbearable to watch. Global news coverage of the alien invasion, yet people are left to fend for themselves in their homes.  How this movie became so popular, instead of the joke of the year is beyond me.

I have been exasperated by it's critics who seemed to have missed the point completely and pick holes in this movie. For me from the very first scene to the last the direction is sublime. Every shot, camera angle and scene works, and it's a delight to marvel at the work of such a great director, whilst enjoying the story build and grip you. The cast is excellent, Mel portrays his character with depth and honesty, Joaquin is intense and mesmerising, the children are a delight, and every one of the side characters are memorable, another ""sign"" of a great director. James Newton Howard's music enhances the movie utterly, with the basic melody building along with the story to a crescendo, building our tension and emotions to their peak. There are some truly beautiful scenes in this movie and the story is ultimately a human one, the ""Signs"" are many and profound and they lead us beautifully to the film's conclusion. I can't recommend this film highly enough, and after 30 years of watching movies and admiring the art that is film making this movie went in to my list of favourites the first time I saw it, and there it will remain.",Signs

Mel Gibson was excellent, as usual, along with the rest of the cast.  Mel has a knack for using just the right children for his movies. It's about time a movie didn't depend on profanity or nudity to get through it. This movie actually allowed actors to act and portray emotion.  It showed that some actors can still act without ripping off their clothes to show love and passion or show anger or other emotion without spewing profanity and offensive four letter words! (What a concept!)  I hope the rest of Hollywood takes the hint and look at the great classics that did the same.  Children wouldn't be left out and they could make more money!",Signs
1325,a_cacace926,Excellent,10,25 February 2007,"Exactly. I thought it was excellent. I think that all you haters out there are retarded too. The point of this movie wasn't aliens invading earth. any one who has seen a movie knows that you have to dig deeper to get the true meaning of a movie. The meaning in this case was, as stated by a fellow user below, is faith within yourself. Graham isn't just battling the aliens in this movie, the main idea is of him battling himself and his inner demons.Personally i believe (since its technically classified as a sci-fi/horror) that this is in fact one of the best horror films of all time. All of you expecting big ugly aliens with guns that can kill us to be scarier need to crawl back under your rocks. One of my film mentors once told me ""what is scary on screen? seeing a big huge drooling creature, or something on the otherside of a door scratching and growling trying to get out and at you?"". Any of you want to argue me on that, go watch the 6th sense.The stereotype in horror films these days is the directors seem to think that using 150 gallons of blood and 24 hot babes fornicating left and right will some how scare the crap out of us.M. overcomes that stereotype in Signs. We don't even see the creatures entirely until the last 10 minutes of the film, and he still left most of the people in the theatre closing their eyes too scared to see what happens next.In conclusion, all of you haters out there need to shut up. all you do is complain about how bad a film is. get a life. see something for what its good for. grow up. instead of criticizing stuff and saying you can do better, than go out and do something better! go make the next casa blanca, go re make citizen kane. just do something instead of being so down on others since everyone is so down on you.",Signs

1327,Geneseo98-1,Think about what the movie is trying to accomplish,8,23 August 2002,"SPOILERS...People who are writing off the whole movie just because of some variations of the following reasons need to think some things over....1. Why did they have to show the alien at the end? He looked stupid. 2. Why would intelligent beings prone to water attack a planet made mostly of water with no suits or anything? 3. The last shot is boring.I can answer all of these reasons to not like the movie in a few sentences. First off, this may be a movie that involves space aliens but it is not a science-fiction movie. The alien invasion serves as the life-altering event needed to jar Mel Gibson's faith back into place.Yes, it seems trivial that a dying wife's last words trigger the husband to tell his brother to beat an alien up with a baseball bat. But isn't that how things work in life? How ""SIGNS"" show up in day-to-day life?The movie comes down to the monologue on the couch. The world can be separated into two groups. One who believe in signs of a higher power and those who don't. This is a movie that shows us a good man's journey between those two. That's the reason the movie didn't delve into any alien-discussions outside of the immediate family. No presidental meetings, no nuclear bomb plans, no military strategies, no reasons for them coming here.Shyalaman had to put fannies in the seats. It's a summer blockbuster. So why not maybe ""trick"" people into thinking it's another basic blockbuster when it really is so much more. Isn't that how Sixth Sense fooled us all.One last thing, Think of the film's opening shot: a hazy shot of the land around the house through a window. Now, think of the last shot: the camera pulling out from that same window except now the window is broken and we can see clearly now, no distortion thanks to the window. Father Ness can see clearly now too. Think about it.",Signs

The story could be interesting, but every time it seemed like something was actually going to happen...it didn't.  That is the main problem with this movie: NOTHING OF INTEREST ACTUALLY HAPPENS!  There is a lot of talk about things happening other places and a few minor things happen, but the movie gets so boring after about 20 minutes that if something did happen, you probably wouldn't care anyway because it would interrupt your nap!  And as for being scary, the scariest part of the whole movie was when the dog barked the first time. The most enjoyable parts of the film were the few moments of comedy.All in all, I would say this is a low-budget movie trying, very poorly, to hide behind a powerful cast, a popular name, and miles and miles of advertising.  Quite frankly, I expected a lot more from everyone involved.",Signs
1333,aasaxell,The most intelligent stupid movie I've seen in a long time,4,27 August 2002,"*SPOILERS APLENTY!*Just finished watching Signs.....That was probably the most unnecessary and elaborate way to describe a mans return to faith....I call this movie intelligent because in many ways it was well written, original and gets you thinking. On the other hand, I call this movie stupid because in many ways it was poorly written, unoriginal and leaves you empty.Having seen neither The Sixth Sense nor Unbreakable (Yes, there are one or two of us out there) I was able to watch this film without any preconceptions or expectations of Shyamalan's latest ""triumph"". I was expecting nothing, and I got nothing in return. (To be honest, I hope that The Sixth Sense is a lot better than this.)Right....I guess I'd better explain my opening statements.The dialogue (and acting, for that matter) was very good, I laughed a few times, I found the kids surprisingly unannoying and the little hints that are given throughout the movie come together nicely towards the end (the whole thing with Bo's ""hydrophobia"" was very clever). HOWEVER; The actual plot was pretty silly. By ""actual"" I mean; Priest loses faith after wife dies in crash, crop circles appear, turns out that aliens are invading the planet, the (former) priest and his family manage to fend off the aliens for one night, the aliens inexplicably leave, man regains his faith and returns to priesthood...The End. I mean seriously, if you read that plot outline, without any knowledge of the cast or crew, there is no way that you would leave your computer/couch/children and go to the movies to see that. I know that the story has a deeper meaning than the skimpy synopsis I've just written, but that's honestly how I felt.This is obviously not a Sci-Fi flick. It's a story about a man and his struggle with his spirituality, disguised under the premise of a Sci-Fi thriller. And a Sci-Fi thriller it is, up until the last 15 min or so, where the real message is revealed. I felt cheated. After watching Signs, I can't help but think of The Abyss. Fantastic build-up, visually superb (although in two different ways), a constant feeling of ""what-will-happen-next"" and then....a finale that completely lets you down, almost insulted. (Don't get me wrong, I love The Abyss. Great movie, stupid ending.) This doesn't mean I would prefer an all out ""Starship Trooperesque"" battle to save humanity. That would've pissed me off completely. It just felt like a total waste of a good idea to make the point of telling people that ""all things happen for a reason"". I'm sure that people who are more spiritually inclined than myself will appreciate this film for those exact reasons, but handing out pamphlets on the subject would have had the same, if not more, impact on me.Focusing on the alien aspect, the amount of flaws and shortcomings they have are just plain bizarre. We're talking about a race of beings that can travel across time and space, engage in inter-planetary warfare and make really groovy patterns in fields, but for some reason they can't seem to grasp the concept of breaking down doors, using weapons and wearing protection against their two arch-nemeses, H20 and baseball bats. Oh, but wait..I almost forgot...One of them does seem to possess the ingenuity to break down a door, ignore the retreat of his compatriots, find Mr. Gibson at the other side of town and nab his kid when nobody was looking. A piece of logic exceeded only by Jaws in ""Jaws: The Revenge"", where the baddest fish in the pond manages to track the frightened heroes from Amity to the Bahamas. Hmmm.....I could go on talking about the great ideas, good screenplay and superb direction only to demote them to the B-Movie level of intelligence and originality that this film sometimes delivers. All in all, I'll have to give this film 5/10...bordering on 4.I'm just glad that I downloaded it instead of forking out money to see it in the theater. Money I could use for bats and water bottles (just in case)",Signs

Shyamalan tells the story in such a fashion that it is almost realistic. I did not know nor could I predict what turn the film was going to take. The movie dives deeper than a mere sci-fi flick.  It delves into the loss of faith, not in God necessarily, but how you live your life.Signs is about a man who has lost the ability to see the good things in life. It does not focus heavily on religion, but rather the love of a family surviving through the worst.Shyamalan uses the art of suspense quite well.  He will cause you to jump a bit in your seat.

1338,AMBEDOHO,(SPOILER)(SPOILER)He's Dreaming(SPOILER)(SPOILER),10,31 August 2002,"Signs is not ""Sci-fi"" as most reviewers want to pigeonhole it.  M night Shyamalan is resurrecting a long dead genre the Hitchcock psychological thriller.  Give them what they think they want without giving them a thing. His use of: Sounds, Music, and Clues, are second only to hitchcock. Shyamalan can easily be labeled a mediocre sci-fi writer/director, but this movie is not a sci-fi movie.  He only led us to believe it was a poor sci-fi film.  (SPOILER)""Father"" Gramm is introduced walking out of the bathroom and we see a cross shaped dust shadow on the wall.  After all of the alien gobbledy goo we see Gramm leave the same bathroom now the cross is on the wall.  The time line is ASSUMED to be several months when in reality it was only over night.  Gramm had a horrifying dream about how humanity is threatened by aliens, which leads to his new found faith.  Shyamalan gave us so many clues beginning with Bo's opening line, ""Uncle Mike are you in my dream also?""  Everyone is clarivoyant.  The crop circles are maps. They ""care"" about rural Pennsylvania.  The drugstore clerk's confession to a protastant priest.  The aliens look like every crude drawing we've seen in the National Enquirer.  Basically every ""plot hole"" you've seen listed was a clue it was a dream in Gramm's head.  Shyamalan is a genius to have fooled almost every reviewer to date into believing this movie is a poor excuse for a sci-fi movie, when in reality it was a hitchcockian (if that is a word)psychological thriller.  Definately 10 out of 10!!!!!!",Signs
1339,oarkhead,Signs: A Thrilling Explanation of Crop Circles,8,5 August 2002,"I went to see Signs a few nights ago with some friends. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of this movie because it deals with aliens. I thought it would be another cheesy sci-fi thriller with a huge battle between aliens and humans in the end, Independence Day style. Boy was I wrong. M. Night Shyamalan's script shines a bunch of light onto the questions Are we alone in the universe? and Are there really any coincidences?Mel Gibson gives a great tormented character performance of a reverend who gives up his faith due to his wife's being killed by a drunk driver. Joaquin Phoenix plays his brother, a former minor league home run champ who lives in the house next door to Mel and his family. Mel Gibson has two children, Morgan and Bo. Both child actors give surprisingly good performances.The little girl was funny because all the water she drinks is 'contaminated' and needs a new glass of water after every few sips of a new glass.Overall, Signs is a thriller put together very well. The script is extraordinary, and the performances are even better. If you have not seen this movie, see it. You will not be disappointed. All throughout the film M. Night Shyamalan keeps you guessing and jumping out of your seat, right up to the amazing climax that explains everything. Well-rounded, simple enough to understand, definitely a winner. I gave it a 9/10.",Signs
1340,Hoffhammer,Can I get my $8 back?,1,24 August 2002,"This movie was atrocious.  Mel Gibson is a fine actor, and so is Phoenix, but they are not enough to carry this pathetic attempt at a thriller. Right from the get-go, NOTHING happens.  Let's see, ONE crop circle appears in his field, they fork a dog, and then sit around the tv and tell each other what is happening.  They do not show us these ""startling images"" on the TV except for once, and that one time the footage looks like that old stock footage of Bigfoot running through the woods.  The child actors are horrible as well. The little girl looks like the Bride of Chucky, and her voice has no inflection at all.  Of course, that could be said for all the characters, except for the aforementioned Phoenix and Gibson.  And we also see an alien foot and hand, and that is it until the very end, and when we do see the alien finally, it is like they stuck a green beer bottle in front of the camera.  You can't make out many details, and the screen is pretty blurry and obscured.  The theme is non-existent.  Gibson gives up being a preacher because his wife gets killed.  So now aliens showing up out of the blue (and then disappearing with nary an explanation) is going to make him find his faith again?  The wispy threads of a plot fail to come together in any cohesive pattern.  I think there are two lines in the film that sum up my thoughts.  The first is Mel Gibson saying, ""You're wasting your time!""  I couldn't agree more.  And the second is Phoenix stating, ""This is just like War of the Worlds.""  Perhaps, but WotW was a good movie.",Signs

Nearly everything was a little clue to something everything can refer to:Bo with her water-tick Merril with his Baseball stick Morgan with his Asthma Attacks and Graham with his lost faith into God...at the end everything will be fine.

Homer Simpson would sum up this waste of time in one word; ""Boooooooooooring""  This has to be the most over-hyped film of all time. I would have fallen asleep during this movie, but everyone else snoring kept me awake.  This movie was flawed from beginning to end. The only redeeming value may be the soundtrack by James Newton Howard.  I would have demanded a refund, but there were too many people in line in front of me to get theirs. 20 minutes of screen time could have been saved if M. Knight Shymalan's cameo had been left on the cutting room floor.  His character was pointless. It made no difference who killed Father Hess' wife, only that she was killed.  And wassup with this long scene about baseball in the Army recruiter's office? Don't get me started about the ""throw-up-in-the-mouth"" speech.

1345,saturdaynight2006,"In a year of great movies, this is one of the best",10,2 August 2002,"Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan is known for his ""A""-movie treatment of ""B""-movie subjects. ""Signs"" easily could have become another Independence Day, with Mel Gibson saving the universe from the threat of alien invasion. Instead, Shyamalan chose to look at this rather silly subject from another point of view - that of an average, small-town family.Indeed, Shyamalan focuses on the more human aspects of an alien invasion, and how it affects the personal and moral beliefs of Gibson's character, Graham. The actors were not a foil for the special effects; the aliens instead contributed towards the fine acting. Early on, Shyamalan creates a tense, disorienting mood, and keeps building it until the end.Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""Unbreakable,"" the ending of this movie is unpredictable, yet hindsight makes it unevitable. Also like Shyamalan's previous films, ""Signs"" deals with more esoteric ideas: in this case, with the nature of fate and predestination. Is there a hand, guiding everything we do? Do miracles exist, or do we face life's blows alone? M. Night Shyamalan answers these questions in a way few can - with excellent writing and solid filmmaking. The Orson Welles of this era, Shyamalan has become a master manipulator of both emotions and expectations, and he uses his talents to their fullest in ""Signs."" Don't go to this movie with any expectations, and you will be thoroughly rewarded.",Signs
1346,Calim11,Excellent piece of filmmaking,10,27 August 2002,"(Spoilers may be included) My mother summed up M. Night films: they're about death in various forms. ""The Sixth Sense"" was about a dead man who didn't know he was, ""Unbreakable"" was about a man who couldn't die, and ""Signs"" is about a man who is spiritually dead.In the latest from M. Night, ""Signs"", we're faced with a man who has lost his way and finds it again through the signs that he finally sees around him, signs that we all have around us and fail to see.  He is forced to see them because of the coming invasion just like we would be if the same thing was happening to us.Because the film focuses on just this one family it makes me, the audience, feel like its happening to me.  By cutting out other families and only giving information that it is a worldly invasion via the television, M. Night has shown me what it would be like if it was really occurring.  It doesn't matter that the world is being invaded, just my little world - my house, my family - that matters.  This film explores that feeling of isolation beautifully.The cast is extraordinary.  As with Bruce Willis in M. Night's other films, Mel Gibson has achieved stillness in this film and he gives a riveting performance.  Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful as the underachiever, Merrill, who saves the day and the children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) steal this picture.Some people have stated that the ending ruins the film.  I found it a perfect ending for a magnetic film.  All the clues are there from the beginning to the end and they tie up in a great ending as Gibson's character finally understands what all the signs were telling him.So see this film!  It is a beautiful piece of work.",Signs

Though the principal cast is small, it is dynamic.

1359,Moon Whale,Better than 6th Sense,10,2 August 2002,"It's amazing to see how many reviews are out there saying this movie is the best film this year and yet there's the same amount of reviews stating it's the worst movie this year.  I am here to say being an avid movie fan that this movie is a very good film and deserves a nine out of ten at the least. If you thought this movie was based on shrieks and freaks that go bump in the night your mistaken.  Unfortunately Mr. Shyamalan didn't have control over the making of the trailers.  This movie goes deeper than aliens and sinister sounds; it goes right to the soul.  The movie bases life on faith and trust.  Whether it's faith in a supreme being like a God or faith in something smaller like another race far beyond Earth.  Signs is built up like any other Shyamalan film making you learn and yet wonder about the characters for the first twenty minutes.  Then after the long twenty minutes the film gains conflict and the anxiety of the film goes to insane proportions.  This film is not meant for young children and teens but mainly for adults that have struggled with life and need to hang on just a little bit longer.  Now of course some of what I wrote falls under implicit meanings but to understand the film you've got to break the middle and end of the film (Signs) especially down.  If you're not into that then it's a great film that portrays a family in a world conflict.  I will also state that the movie did freak me out of times but it was just an added bonus to what Shyamalan was going at.  As Shyamalan said in a review not to long ago, `If I didn't have aliens at all in Signs I would at least still get my point across.'  -9/10-",Signs

1363,Dodger1614,Most Unexpected movie of the Summer,10,3 August 2002,"Looking at the other comment on this movie makes me think about how people look at all the stuff in the movies and point out the bad stuff. Granted, this movie is not totally about UFO's or aliens or even crop circles. Rather the movie title alludes to different signs, signs that there is Someone working for us, not against us. I read the reviews of this movie and had a very small inkling of what I was to expect from this movie. I read about the parts about the spookiness of the aliens, the spirituality of the good Reverend Hess and the storytelling of M. Night. When I came out of the theater, I was totally content. This movie was worth it and then some. This movie was a long step from M. Night's twist endings, but if you see it again, not really. I don't want to spoil it for anyone if they are reading this. (If you haven't seen this movie, come back and read this when you have.)SPOILERS--------------------------------------------------------------- One thing that has been a constant with M. Night's movies is his real writing that gets the humor and terror from everyday situations. When Merrill flinches at his taunter in the Army recruiting office, I can imagine my friends, who are also baseball players, do the same thing if someone was heckling them. I loved it. And when Isabelle, the dog is barking and then stops after a scuffle, that is way more terrifying than seeing the aliens come for you. In the end, this was a very uplifting movie and I'm GLAD IT ENDED THE WAY IT DID. If it went further, it would have ruined it. This was a story about a man in extrodinary circumstances wrestling with faith. Not about alien invasions. Very good performances by the kids, Mel and especially Joaquin. Even the Hitchcock cameo by M. Night was great. I'll never look at a pantry the same way again. But I will look towards the heavens and not for spacecraft, either.",Signs

But, by then, you're so worn out by the draggy pace of the film, you've lost interest in the picture.Mel Gibson seemed bored with his role. J. Phoenix vastly over-acted as he often does. He can be a great actor when carefully directed, but that was not the case here.One big problem for me was that the film never addressed the issue that ""real"" crop circles were proven to be fake in actuality when they appeared in England several years ago. So when they appear in the picture, they seem silly, not scary.Also, the writer needs to do some basic research about how corn grows!

Mel Gibson as per usual was excellent. The story's perspective is clever, as we rarely see this sort of story from the ordinary person's point of view, with regards to Aliens invasion.You know most films seem to have the government, army, etc., in the film somewhere. This does not. Also the clever lack of background music is the reason for the very eyrie atmosphere that the director seems to have strived for and achieved.Although I felt that the charters did some strange things.For example if you where being pursued in your own house by someone or something the natural reaction is to arm your self, even if only with a tennis shoe, to lash out at, no one did. They seemed happy to wait what ever fait would come. When the son is under grave threat, the notion of striking out, at the threat seems to evade the brother, who is portrayed as a bit of a thug come nice guy. The end was also a little lame, but these complaints set aside I would recommend this film.",Signs

The characters are well-developed and perfectly acted (particularly by Mel Gibson). The writing and themes are very well thought, tying the story's sci-fi aspect in with the character's own personal struggles. The cinematography is fantastic.

It made me feel the same way ""Unbreakable"" did, except that it was also creepy and scary as hell at some points.There was so much tension in this film.  So many long silences that made me almost shake with apprehension.  There wasn't anything about this movie that I didn't like.  I liked it better than ""The Sixth Sense""--quite a bit better, actually.  I'm still not sure if I liked it more than ""Unbreakable."" They are both two of my favorite movies of recent years.  And ""Signs"" really did scare me.I really regret not seeing ""Unbreakable"" in the theater.  I regretted it as soon as I saw it on DVD.  So I made sure to see ""Signs"" as soon as I could, and as long as M. Knight Shyamalan keeps making movies as exciting as those two, I'll keep going opening day.  I'd love to talk to that guy.

There are moments of comic relief, but they are not too heavy handed as to take away from the suspense.  I do think that M. Night's story telling is still a bit amateurish in spots though.  I don't understand why he feels like he needs to hit us over the head with his message sometimes (e.g. the whole ""that's why he has asthma"" thing).

That's because the director has created such a superb atmosphere and built the tension that makes a huge impact on our minds. Also this movie makes people think about their beliefs and disbeliefs about god. It makes much higher impression than any other movie about aliens or a documentary about crop-circles. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are both at their best at acting. The kids in movie are good too, and non-irritating unlike some other movies.

It can't even be described as entertaining. Sixth Sense was a scary and thought-provoking movie that kept me up many nights. Signs is trying to be a suspenseful film with some substance.(Substance as in the lost faith of the reverend.) But the substance was ridiculous and the suspense was unrewarding. Is this film supposed to be a drama about a man who doubts the existence of a caring God, or is this a film about the invasion of aliens? Either way, Signs falls short. The scene when Mel Gibson tells Joaquin Phoenix about the two kinds of people in the world was perhaps the most superficial and idiotic scene in film history.

At some points I wasn't sure if I was crying because it was sad or because the movie was just so GOOD. I am in awe of the genius of M. Night Shyamalan-I've been a fan of his since before The Sixth Sense. He has this talent that lets him get below the surface of his viewers.

A brief glimpse of the coming attractions before ""signs"" is more than enough evidence of that. However, I cannot see how he's succeeded in bringing us much more in this latest effort.""Signs"" does manage to keep my attention, however, it is ultimately a sadly uneven film. Too many films have played with a central character who's lost his faith only to gain it again through some extraordinary sufferings. This story has been appearing time and again since the Bible. However, the ultimate failing of ""signs"" is that it hasn't illuminated this story in a way that it hasn't been before. The strength of M.Night Shyamalan's previous work is that it has offered an aggressively unique approach, and has sought to play with the mind of the audience. The only way that ""Signs"" played with my mind was the dumbfounded feeling I had waiting for my mind to played with. It's straightforward approach jammed into a pseudo artistic wrapper is more insulting than a movie that slaps me in the face with it's formulaic weapons.",Signs

This particular film has all of the essential elements: humor, adventure, suspense and most of all, soul.

1397,kwyjibo5000,A sci-fi thriller... I think,7,10 August 2002,"I voted a six for this movie for a reason.  It's been two days since I have seen it yet I am still not sure what my exact opinion is.  It's not a bad movie, don't get me wrong, but I haven't decided whether it's a great movie. It certainly doesn't deserve to be ranked #176 of 250, as it currently is.Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Rory Culkin are all incredible in the film. The young Abigail Breslin is fine but a little too quiet for the movie.
As has come to be public knowledge of M. Night Shyamalan, sound plays an extraordinary role in this film.  The sound from the baby monitor, the haunting hiss/click noises from the supernatural beings, and the whirring wind and shaking corn husks that make you feel a cool breeze as Gibson rushes through a corn field.  Even silence is a major character in the movie.The only reservation that I have for Signs is the ill-timed, often inappropriate humor that Shyamalan feels the need to inject just as the tension is building to a break.  The ""quirky"" if not sometimes ""stupid"" humor that is sandwiched in with the startle scares often times takes away from the thriller genre this movie should be trying harder to achieve.
I could not give a decisive thumbs up or thumbs down to this movie.  I say go see it and decide for yourself if this is the way you want your sci-fi, horror, thriller movies to proceed.If you disagree send me an e-mail.  It's right up there ^.",Signs

All the characters have their own dilemmas, and like a painting we all take something different away from it.Signs is entertaining, it has a Hitchcock flair to it.  You don't get the easy ""give-away"" shots that you expect.  Mostly though, you will be provoked to think about your own perception on life, and your choices.  I came away asking which type of person am I?This movie isn't an ""Independence Day"", it is a 1 hour and 45 minute long question about your self image and self-awareness.  Do things just happen randomly, or is there a higher reason?  If they do happen randomly - we should be very afraid.  But then there are those that have more Faith than that, they have a quiet confidence, and a hope that carries them through the struggles of life.  Be it a fire, disease, lost child, or even aliens - it's about Faith in God.This is an excellent movie, it asks a question that some don't like to think about, and leaves no place for an answer.

1399,nox12,THE TRADEMARK TWIST? UNSUSPECTING AUDIENCE DUPED BY SHYAMALAN,1,12 August 2002,"SPOILER: THE TRUE PLOT/STORYLINE - OTHERWISE NO SPECIFIC DETAILSThe only twist here is that this movie was marketed as a scary mystery involving the origin of crop circles and aliens but has very little to do with either.  If you are in the mood for a tired old plot with heavy-handed (some might even say nonsensical) religious messages rehashed with the prospect of aliens/crop circles featured basically as a 'hook', AND you don't expect the characters to speak or act realistically, AND a logical plot is not terribly important, then you probably won't have too much of a problem with this film.  But that is not the film I expected to see.  My strongest, and totally unexpected, reaction to this film was ANGER!  I don't mind seeing a bad film, one that just doesn't pull things off, or is the sad product of people with little talent or imagination.  But this is personal! Shyamalan's previous surprises have been revelatory and thought provoking. With 'Signs', Shyamalan has demonstrated an appalling lack of respect for his audience and apparently has no ethical qualms about using them to make a buck or to force-feed them his viewpoint, whichever is the motivation. The audience here is just being duped, manipulated and ripped off.  If you happen to like the end message, that's fine, no problem.  However, pleaseunderstand that it is STILL a 'bait and switch'.  The fact that someone might like the cheap, shoddy and unimaginative 'substitute' instead of the shiny new product they were enticed into the store (theatre) with, doesn't change the fact that a rip-off took place.  All you really get is one of the oldest movie plots in history - man has faith, man suffers a loss, man loses faith, something 'miraculous' happens, man gets faith back.  AND we are manipulated into seeing it, paying money and giving up 2 hours of our life that we'll never get back, by false advertising.  No offense to any spiritual believers, but if I wanted to see a movie with a supposedly 'uplifting' religious message, I can think of a LOT better ones than this to watch.  Yes, there was a good bit of genuine humor and a few very suspenseful moments.  I was suspending disbelief and really enjoying the humor and suspense (even though very contrived) up to a point.  The problem was that almost from the start the whole thing was marred with implausibilities in plot, dialogue, and character's behavior that just kept adding up until they inevitably made it difficult to enjoy the film even on a superficial level.  Even so, I held out hope until the end.  My reward? The big finale was just stupid, period.  I can only assume the much-anticipated trademark 'twist' is, in reality, simply that many people will be suckered into paying to see a film they otherwise wouldn't have watched and won't enjoy.  View at your own risk!",Signs

1402,sl83,Could be much better,5,16 August 2002,"Of course after watching the first two masterpieces by M Night Shyamalan, I went to the theatres to watch ""signs"" with very high expectations, and I am really sad to say that my level of disappointment increases as the movie went on.No doubt that the acting was superb, all the actors did a great job and I was even surprised to see Mr. Shyamalan himself playing a role in the movie.Yes, now to the disappointing part, that is the plot of this movie. It is true you might say that this movie is not so much about aliens, its about a man who loses faith and finds it again, there are so many plots that could be used to tell a story about how a man would lose his faith and finds his faith again. However, since Mr.Shyamalan had chosen to use the invasion of aliens on to earth as his plot, I think he should develop the plot well enough. I think that he should explain more about the ""Signs"" and how are they related.**Spoilers** Subsequently, while watching the movie, I was giving hopes on how Mr.Shyamalan would end this movie as many people think that the invasion of the aliens would bring this world to the end. Sadly, I almost burst out laughing at the part when they just said that the aliens have left our word as we humans have found a way to defeat them and they are afraid of water. This concludes that the aliens were not as smart as we human beings, which is redundant to what the story told us earlier that the aliens were smart as they anticipated humans would use nuclear weapons to defeat them and the world would be no use to them after that. Adding to it, while the aliens were searching for the Hess family in the basement, it also told us that they were smart and they were able to solve any difficulties that they confront. At that point I thought the story was getting interesting as the pace of the movie was picking up while suddenly it ended up that the aliens just ""left"" the planet! Do enlighten us something more about the signs, the aliens.. some new ideas that we don't know!!However, I think the acting alone made this movie worth watching, Mel Gibson along with Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin did play their character very well. The managed to capture the emotions of the audience and it was well done! On top of that, I did enjoyed the part about the reason Mel Gibson quit being a priest and the idea that does coincidence really exist.In summary, the movie was okay .. the movie actually does have a bit of scary and frightening moments, it's just that the plot about the invasion of aliens should be improved further!

People see these things and start drooling like some Pavlovian pooch, expecting to know EXACTLY what the movie is going to be about. THAT'S THE POINT! Shyamalan IS the next Spielberg (before he sold out). He has studied such move greats like Hitchcock and paid attention. His use of darkness, sounds, and depth of characters are prime examples of this.

1408,roth1900,The genre's of Family Drama and Suspenseful Thriller.they don't really fit together. or do they?,10,15 September 2002,"""Signs"", the newest from director M. Night Shyamalan, has revived a nearly extinct art form-- True Suspense. This absolute skill requires four basic but necessary components: complex characters, at least two story lines of different genre, a filmmaker that thinks past the commercial success and looks through to the genuine idea of the movie, and a soundtrack that is more chilling than the show could ever wish. ""Signs"" reaches all of these goals and exceeds them with a tremendous amount of heart and terror (unfortunately, I have limited space to write so I am going to focus on the first two rules predominately).As per all of Shyamalan's movies, the characters are the most intriguing puzzle piece of the movie. Mel Gibson portrays Graham Hess, an Episcopalian minister that converts to atheism after the heartbreaking death of his wife. His two young children (Rory Culkin and Abby Breslin, both are extraordinary child actors whom I am excited to see more from) are trying to cope with the loss of their mother and adjust to the complete transformation of their father. Joaquin Phoenix plays Merrill Hess, an uncle and brother that acts as the `fill-in father' while Graham is mourning over his wife.  The idea of a newly single parent isn't new to Shyamalan's films though, in `The Sixth Sense' the mother of Haley Joel Osment is a single parent and in `Unbreakable' Bruce Willis is ready to divorce his wife and leave his child for a career in New York.Going into the movie, I expected a mind-blowing thriller about aliens attacking the planet while a farming family defends their home-and that I did receive. What I didn't expect was the profound force of the metaphysical and heartbreak surrounding all of the characters. While most will argue this is a film about aliens, I will contradict and say this is a film of survival. Images of aliens terrorizing children and the unmistakable sounds of an alien in a cornfield will stick with you as you drive home, but so will the touching speeches given by Mel Gibson and the fact that fate and faith guides us and the message that whatever happens has happened for a reason. That my friends, is the moral of this story, unlike some alien movies that teach us big guns and a lot of ammo will resolve anything.
Though `Sixth Sense' brought Night into day, `Signs' will allow him the opportunity to be a legend in filmmaking.  Some compare Night to Hitchcock and Spielberg, but Night has formed his own niche in the motion picture industry, now, others will be compared to him. The true test of a movie is whether or not you can describe the emotion and significance in a single sentence, if you can, then you have just wasted your time on a movie.  The nearest thing to a single sentence summary for `Signs' is. A reverend turned atheist must protect his family and reconsider his beliefs when a worldwide phenomena touches his home.",Signs

They say that the aliens, who are much more advanced, need crop circles to find their way around, don't have weapons, and that they couldn't knock down a wooden door.  I have only one thing to say to these.  THIS WAS NOT THE MAIN POINT OF THE MOVIE. Plus, crop circles have been known to be related to aliens so M. Night probably put them in there to get the idea of aliens coming.  Hmmmm... crop circles=signs, there are signs in the movie.... the movie's title is SIGNS.  The aliens didn't bring any weapons because, as it says during the movie, they are afraid that we will us nukes and the nukes would destroy the planet.  And about the doors, WHO REALLY CARES?!?!?!The whole point of the movie wasn't an Independence Day, or an XXX action packed kind of movie.  It was a thinking and a drama movie.  M. Night wanted the viewer to be swayed by this movie and to look onto their own lives to see if there were problems that could be changed, not by a bad experience, but by the viewers own determination.Over all... this movie is one of the best ever made and anyone who disagrees can try to make their own movie, writing the script, shooting the movie, and editing.  Then you will see how hard it is to make the movie... I have a great admirance to M. Night because I have made my own movies and know how hard it is to get the viewer to see your point of view.",Signs
1411,dmorton-10,One of most stupid movies I have ever seen,1,24 May 2008,"Again, Hollywood insults the intelligence of the cash carrying public.This is a story of and alien invasion - well, its the story of a small town family in the midst of an alien invasion.Its plays out with a priest who loses his faith, a family that loses its mother, and of course, all that is nicely resolved as the story plays out through the alien invasion.The aliens in this film are somewhat mysterious, possessing a multitude of spacecraft, lurking around in the dark, making crop circles, and without really being given much treatment except as a source of menacing and scary noises. Oh yeah, poison gas can come out of a thing on their wrists, whose only function seems to be threatening children.Having sat all the way through this film, wondering what its all about, we find that the aliens really are invading the earth, and soon after that we find out that this story will resolve by a secret alien vulnerability.Whats the secret alien vulnerability? They melt when they come into contact with water. A little girl, who has been stashing glasses of water around the house throughout the whole film, throws one on an alien and it melts. Boom Boom.At this point, the sheer intellectual laziness of this film washes over me, filling me rage. $10 and this is the best you can offer me.You can picture the writers huddle - ""ok, now, how do we get rid of the alien menace before the film end? I know, they are vulnerable to ...., {swigging from a bottle of Perrier}, um, WATER!. Oh fantastic, you are a genius, lets put that in the script and we can all go home now."" So lets see here - an alien civilization travels between the stars to invade the earth, a planet 70% covered by water, and where almost no place is untouched by rain, and they forget to wear the simple protection that something like a raincoat might offer, not to mention any other protective measures their star-traveling civilization might have come up with for when they encounter this most common of solvents.Hollywood writers, I know its just a plot device, but fer Christ's sake, if you cant come up with something better than this, you should probably go and find another job. It really wouldn't take much more thought - you could pick any common household substance to use, petrol, ammonia, whatever, and it would be more credible, and I wouldn't feel like I was just slimed as I leave the film.",Signs
1412,Patrick_Lohmeier,THE SIXTH SENSE Part III,1,17 September 2002,"SPOILER ALERT Who told M. Night Shyamalan that it is really cool to make the same movie over and over again? Let's remember: (*Spoilers!*) In THE SIXTH SENSE we have a middle-aged man (Bruce Willis) with lots of personal problems who - with the support of a smart weirdo-kid - finds out that he is a ghost (Surprise!!!). In UNBREAKABLE we have a middle-aged man (Willis again) with lots of personal problems who - with the support of his not-so-smart weirdo-son - finds out that he is a super-hero (Surprise!!!). In SIGNS we have a middle-aged man (Mel Gibson) with lots of personal problems who - with the help of his two weirdo-kids - finds out that he is a kind of super-hero priest who uses his faith in God to destroy the aliens (Surprise!!!).The worst thing about Shyamalan and these identical storylines is, that these seem to work very well for most moviegoers and that his movies make such lots of money... I was surprised when I read all the positive reviews of SIGNS in the US and compared them to those published in Europe, nearly all of which were bad ones. I wonder if there are really such deep cultural gaps between America and Europe and why some groups of people seem to be so attracted by these kind of paranoia-movies and some don't.And another thing...Well, I don't have a problem with kids given a main role in movies. Actually, Haley Joel Osment was great in SIXTH SENSE. But he didn't feel 'real', more like a superior being. That's OK because that was the character he played. The children in SIGNS are very similar to Osment's character... but they don't show any emotion!!! What's up with these kids? Is it the actors' lack of talent or does M. Night Shyamalan think that little children behave like that? Examples? - The family dog is killed by the son: No emotions. ([calm] ""Dad, the dog is dead."") - The little daughter sees an alien at night: No emotions (""I can't sleep. Wanna drink some water."") - (*Spoiler*) Imagine a six year-old girl which has to see how an alien tries to kill her brother... What would she do? Scream? Cry? Lose consciousness? Well, in SIGNS she just watches the scene and mumbles some weird stuff about the water which will ultimately kill the alien.What's a movie where all the characters feel so unreal that I don't care about them? A bad one, from my point of view.",Signs
1413,remieres,Good movie,8,20 September 2002,"I am not going to give this movies a bad rating.  Because it was a great piece of work.  The movie was not a disappointment when it came to keeping up to today's competition and talent.  On the contrary it is probably one of this decades best example of a movie that runs on the fear of who ever is watching.  for the movie buff that sees a movie as nothing but makeup and photography,  it might have been a bad movie.  But I give this movie 2 thumbs up for the fact that it gave me the chills most of the way.  and also raised my eyebrows to some questions that I have had my self on the subject that this movie was based. everyone is entitled to their own opinion about a movie or story. and I give mine freely as this is a Good film.  Right along with movies like 6th sense.",Signs
1414,Aphius,Now where are Mulder and Scully?,10,20 September 2002,"I loved this movie; I truly, honestly did.  It had almost everything I could ever want in an alien-scary-horror-thriller-drama-scifi-type movie!  Just except Mulder and Scully.Personally, I love the actors; Mel Gibson was wonderful in this movie and his sarcasm at times was a really good addition as well.  Just like with Joaquin Phoenix; his character was sarcastic when he needed to be and that added to the whole movie.  The two other main characters, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, were excellent as well.  It's nice to see some more little children as some of the main actors.(SPOILERS AHEAD)When the aliens leave, I found most people were totally confused.  Some reasons they probably left was all the water; you know, the Earth IS around 70% water and only 30% land.  Those aliens couldn't stand water and we sure had lots of it; it also has a part where Joaquin's character is talking to Mel's character in the basement and says something about some people found a way to stop the aliens.  It was water.  Okay!  Okay!  So yes, it was odd when they left but if you think about it just for a MOMENT, it does make sense.Now one thing that could have been done better to ME is the dream parts. I thought that at first, when Mel's character was getting out of the car dressed in his Priest suit was real!  Not a dream!  Well, now I don't know how it could have been done better.  Maybe a flash at the bottom saying, ""DREAM SEQUENCE!"" or something alone those lines.  Corny, yes.  Pathetic, yes.  Needed, not really.In all, the movie was great.  I just think you need to have a kind of thing for these movies to actually appreciate them.  To me, this was better than The Sixth Sense.  M. Night Shyamalan is getting better!Just my two cents.",Signs
1415,anshell,Looking for faith,10,1 October 2002,"Once more,Shyamalan does not speak about ghosts, heros or aliens, He speaks about the hard way to find faith, love and family ties. We find a very different and tender story with a special family (brothers and little kids) trying to keep the love and faith.Joaquin Phoenix gives us a great work as Merrill Hess, and Rory Culkin (who I find in ""You can count on me"") is his perfect little alter ego. Even Mel is marvelous. The best scene: Joaquin watching TV, He is really frightened!!!!. I cried, I laughed and I screamed: These are all things that I want in a movie, there is not anything else.It was perfect.",Signs
1416,psybro,"Great Movie, Christawful Finish",7,7 October 2002,"This film has been wrongfully promoted as being a full-blown alien invasion movie.  The actual invasion turns out to be a lot less prominent than you expect.  The film focuses, instead, on the family of Father Graham Hess (Gibson), a priest who leaves the church after the death of his wife.  It also has a strong message about faith, which some might find too preachy. Another part which goes uncommented on is the light-hearted comedy that is on display (`I am insane with anger!', `It was very dark.').  Perhaps disappointingly, the aliens end up being a mere vehicle for the true meat of the film; the emotional responses of the characters to the deadly situation they are put in.  Nonetheless, suspense is masterfully built up throughout the film, with excellent usage of light and particularly sound.  I can't say much more without spoiling the plot.  However, I will say that the conclusion is extremely disappointing, and ends what was a very good, suspenseful production on a slightly low key.  Also, you may soil yourself at the scary parts, or just laugh, depending on your disposition.",Signs

I'd heard mixed reviews and frankly would have been happier going to see ""Red Dragon"" instead.Yes, M. Night Shyamalan knows how to build tension. Yes, Mel Gibson is unusually good in this. Yes, Rory Culkin is good, too. But the aliens are just plain ridiculous. Frankly, Shyamalan is much better on the emotional bits than the scary sci-fi bits, which is what we paid to see.

What makes the thriller so effective is that Shyamalan does not have to use a lot of gore or cheap thrills to captivate the audience. The movie's simple tone makes every thrilling move even more thrilling than it would seem in an average thriller. Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and the child actors give a great performance as the family whose lives have been altered by these mysterious 'SIGNS'. Beware though, that by the end of the movie, you will find out the true meaning of 'SIGNS'. Really, the only disappointment with the movie is the ending, which has become a signature for Shyamalan in his previous films , ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". This movie is setup so well for a thrilling ending, that it comes off as rather anticlimactic. Overall though, one of the best suspense thrillers you will see. 7/10",Signs

It was so weird to see that.Has anybody else seen this?But really it was a nice movie...I saw it 6 months after it was released, liked it back then and still like it.

Now, it is not a bad movie, it's just that it's below the Shyamalan standard that we now expect.Strength: the cast, the cinematography, suspense, sound and lightWeakness: unbelievable, the ending (he couldn't use the flu to get rid of the aliens, for obvious reasons -war of the worlds-, so he had to settle for... you'll see!)Overall rating : 6.6 Worth watching, but not Shyamalan greatest by far.",Signs

1427,wordman2k,Big Disappointment,4,13 November 2007,"After the ""wow"" of The Sixth Sense, I expected to be wowed again by Signs. Instead, I ended up laughing through the finale! This film does NOT belong in the same category of greats that includes: War of the Worlds (Gene Barry original), Alien, and The Day The Earth Stood Still. Outstanding shock scenes overshadowed the director's serious omissions and clumsy character motivators. Examples: 1) Wife is conscious and pinned against a tree by a car. EMTs decide she will die soon and fetch her husband so they can have a final moment together... and deliver Mel Gibson's big tag line,""Swing away."" Are you serious??! EMTs rescue, treat and transport all victims. They do not withhold treatment to allow a tender moment. 2) The alien is standing in the living room and about to administer a fatal dose of gas to Mel's son. Does the director really expect us to believe that the boys' father needed his dead wife's inspirational pronouncement and his trophy bat to save his son??? What father wouldn't have ferociously launched himself at the creature or pummeled it with a chair? 3) In all the documentaries about this phenomenon, they are referred to as ""circles."" Not one calls them ""crop signs"" ... except in this movie.This film is full of such amateurish oversights and mechanical breakdowns. They're actually fun to look for. Start your own list.",Signs

Instead Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix look like they are half asleep all through this movie. Extremely disappointing to see this movie signed (heh) by the director of ""The Sixth Sense"". I am surprised to see so many votes, it is a bore. The so-called alien seems to be involuntarily funny, and the facial expression on the actors seem to be ""I am surprised, I am surprised, Now I am an itsy-bitsy more surprised"". The plot line is laughable, especially when you consider, that the aliens worst enemy is water and they then decide to go to our planet Earth which is not exactly the driest of spots. Re-visit your cd-collection or do the dishes instead of letting this movie take your time.",Signs
1429,Meres7341,Really well done,9,17 March 2003,"I think this movie was really great.  I couldn't help but think of Hitchcock movies when I first saw it.  The way the camera moves and sustains long, steady, unmoving shots really creates suspense that can't be matched with computer generated aliens.  Hitchcock was the master of this type of suspense, and Shamylan can't quite be compared with Hitchcock, but their styles are similar, and I think that's refreshing.  (The cameos that Hitchcock was famous for are even being reincarnated by Shamylan.) Instead of trying to scare us with gore and disturbing images, we have to deal with constant tension and fear of the unknown.    Shamylan lets us use our imaginations, which is scarier than throwing aliens in our faces and showing us what we are supposed to be scared of.  Other than just being suspenseful, the humor that is intertwined to lighten the mood really makes it enjoyable. The cursing scene and the comment about the female Scandinavian Olympian were especially amusing.  But even more than the suspense and humor, the deeper questions that the story bring up really make the movie great. Good movies are meant to entertain you, but great movies make you think, and this movie made me think.  The whole ""is it possible that there are no coincidences"" got my mind going.  Contrary to what other people have been saying in their comments, I think M. Night Shamylan is a promising director who has a fulfilling career ahead of him.",Signs

The plot takes itself seriously, which is great, only it fails to deliver on any sort of believability.  The plot holes are too numerous to list entirely.  A few big ones: How'd they get here?  Why would they try to take over the world without using any advanced weaponry?  Why, if they are very physically superior to humans, would a normal man be able to lock one in a closet? Why would that person then not call the authorities but rather head for the lake?  Why would these aliens give a rat's behind about a totally insignificant farming family?  And on and on and on.  The concept of the wife's last moments and last words is a good plot facet, but again the specifics cause it to fumble.  ""Swing away""?  ""See""?  I laughed at the end because I thought the foreshadowing was so lame.There are a few good moments of suspense, and a few brief frightening moments, but if you're a fan of good screen writing, this is definitely not the movie for you.  3 out of 10.",Signs

1437,BigOkie,As close to Hitchcock as this generation of directors will get,10,30 September 2003,"With the current generation of directors relying on mindless plots and CGI to the hilt to make a statement, it's really refreshing to see a director unafraid of risk-taking.M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" embodies everything that a movie-going experience should be about.  The emotion that this director draws from his performers is incredible.  He leaves you on the edge of your seat when it's all said and done.I've read several negative reviews through these comments, and I can understand.  For the last 25 years we've been blasted with cheap, thrill-a-minute, high-budget action flicks that are all flash and no substance; and as such, we've been seasoned to believe that a good movie MUST have some sort of resolution at the end of it.  The bad guy must die, the good guy must get the girl, so on and so forth.  But Night refuses to get bitten by that bug.This is a psychological thriller, the kind that makes you want to gnaw on your fingernails for 105 minutes until you know the main characters are safe.  The kind that makes you feel like even though you've only watched the movie for 45 minutes, you know the characters like they were your best friends..all the little quirks.I heard a rumor in the beginning, Touchstone didn't want Mel Gibson cast as the lead in this movie, that they wanted Bruce Willis.  While Bruce Willis is a superb actor, I just don't believe he has the range of emotion that Mel Gibson displays in this film.  Very strong performances from Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin make this movie shine.Whether or not this movie is about aliens is secondary; it's more about the triumph of the spirit over adversity.  Shyamalan's choice of James Newton Howard to once again score one of his films proves to be a work of absolute genius, as his score sets the tone from the opening credits to the incredible climax of the film.I'm sure Hitchcock and Hermann are smiling devilishly at the advent of this young, fresh director, and thinking quietly to themselves ""The MacGuffin lives""....",Signs

The director and story teller does a good and unique job of engaging the viewer so we're on the edge of our sets wondering what is going to happen next and what is around the next corner and in the director's usual style, there's a hidden story secret that's revealed at the climax.  This is not just a story about scary things that frighten us, but a story about people and their relationships and beliefs.  I'm not religious, but found the lead characters conflict compelling.Also, I saw ""Unbreakable"" (same writer/director) and didn't think that movie was engaging as compared to this one.  And I thought this was a little better than that ""I see dead people"" movie (completely forgot name!) perhaps because I'm not sure that Bruce Willis is the best choice for this sort of role.However, I'm definitely glad to have this writer/director out there creating movies (won't attempt to butcher the spelling of his name from memory) and I think he's one of the top movie-makers these days.Don't forget to see his home-videos on the DVD version(s)--- it's a reminder that it takes a lot of work and commitment to achieve what he has, but that it all starts with a desire/vision/dream.",Signs

1441,Yousry,Excellent if seen from certain angles,8,9 August 2004,"Spoiler WarningI have seen this movie and I liked it. I find this movie a pioneer in dealing with belief in god -as an orthodox issue- through science fiction -as a relatively modern subject- which is what I liked, and that is what some people missed about this movie as they looked at it as is, they didn't read what is between the lines, they ignored that the science fiction was only a means of discussing the orthodox issue of belief. The title could be seen as signs from god instead of signs from the aliens -as suggested by the poster- Starting from the beginning of the movie till its end M. Night Shyamalan was giving hints that everything happens for a reason, that God doesn't just shuffle events or fates randomly. I think that Shyamalan is trying to prove that all the daily events that we either brag or complain about is only a small part of a bigger thing and somehow I think that this is the key to get a better understanding of this movie and that is what I liked about it. I found Shyamalan was a little bit Cartesian in the process of proving the viability of belief in God.On the other hand, judging this movie on strictly science fiction bases I actually found it hilarious. First of all, the idea of crop signs saying attack or land here or whatever -as suggested by Scary movie 3- is a bit stupid. If I had the technology to travel through the universe would I need landing signs designed on such a ""mark your territory"" approach? Secondly, the idea of aliens, who by the way can be ""erased"" by water, invading a planet that is 70% covered by water is amazingly idiotic. Among the things that I also disliked about this movie was the look of the aliens. It was old-fashioned and outdated. As a matter of fact it was the standard issue alien of the 60's brought back to the new millennium, but this could be explained by Shyamalan's vague tendency of unfocusing on the fiction part, rather, making it a means of discussing belief or faith. Finally, I think creating such a controversial movie could be one of the things that contributed to its success.",Signs
1442,imdb-189-492949,An analysis of the human psyche,8,17 August 2012,"When I first saw this movie, I did not particularly liked it, it is not a good 'alien invade earth' kind of movie, there are many flaws in that as many pointed out, technology advanced alien capable of traveling through space would not invade sending virtually unprepared and unequipped troops to the planet, I know people have said that is a tactic to avoid destroying earth in a human conflict, but it does not make sense, there are a lot of technological attacks that would disable the hole earth defense system quickly without need to do it in a guerrilla type of invasion.Anyway someone pointed out that most people did not get the movie, that there were no aliens, that the director intentionally misled the beliefs of the spectators to think in a way, and I thought, maybe it is true, and I saw it again, but there is a strange alien type being in the movie, and there are things on the sky, and signs on the ground of course.So there are aliens, but when I saw it again, I thought maybe the director really misled the spectators, it is really not a good 'alien invades earth' kind of movie, because they are not invading earth, I think they are leaving earth, the aliens are not soldier ground troops, they were already on earth for a long time, somewhere away from humans, that is why they are not good fighters maybe they are just scientists and have just very basic self-defense skills, I am not sure, but they communicate with home with the signs on the fields, like they have been doing for decades, it is just that now they finished whatever they were doing and put up signs so someone comes pick them up. And they do so and go away... there is no major war, in the chaos and fear of humans some of them are killed, but I guess they knew that doing research in an savage planet might have its risks, like any researcher can die on duty going to the middle of the jungle, no big deal really, it is part of the risk of the job.Anyway I think the movie is really more about human faith, what we belief in, how we perceive reality, and how we bend reality to justify what we belief in, how we put meaning in things we don't understand, how humans need to understand and rationalize things they don't really understand what their true nature means.Seeing the movie in this light makes the movie much more enjoyable as an analysis of the human psyche. But even then I wonder if I am not the one rationalizing myself... :-)",Signs

I even watched it over completely to make sure I didn't miss anything but it was just a terribly directed movie with unbelievable characters. As much as I like Mel Gibson and I believe he is an outstanding actor he could not save this one. You would think that if the world was about to go to war with a highly advanced alien race that were as horrifying as the ones they showed in the movie the children might have showed some emotion but it was so matter of fact it was hard to feel there was ever any danger. I believe it could have been a better movie with someone else at the wheel and if it weren't for the outstanding cast this would have made Ed Wood look good. I watched this film when it was released to video and everyone that I talked to about it had basically the same opinion, saying they waited thinking the story was about just about to take off and redeem it through the whole movie but it just never happened.",Signs
1445,judithkasim,Good creepy film,8,12 March 2012,"I have been a horror film fan for 30 years. While I remember a few films actually scaring me as a kid (Jaws, Psycho), I have failed to encounter many in my adult life. I like to be scared, but Hollywood has seen fit to retread every tired formulaic convention in just about everything it throws at the local multiplex. Even the independent filmmakers, free of the ""system"", seem to forget what FEAR is. Mostly I sit solemnly staring in disbelief at the screen, waiting and hoping to get those goosebumps. Then, finally, we were given Signs. Most will say, including the director, that this is not a horror film; I genuinely disagree. If this is not a horror flick, then it is time for this film to start a branch of its own and begin a new genre. I admired every little aspect of this picture, from the use of everyday objects: baby monitor, a blank television screen and a half empty glass of water, to convey and act as a vehicle to extract fear from the ordinary. Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the most out of space, actors and sound. It is the lingering shot on a basement staircase when you are desperately hoping he moves his camera to show us more, or the screeching sound in the next room whose source he won't reveal . This director knows just how long to hold the shot, to increase the tension and build the suspense, long enough for our mind to begin forming pictures. And those pictures can be the most frightening of all. Stay the course Shyamalan.",Signs

I love the script... Especially when I saw the new horror movies that came in this year, I really can understand the value of this movie much more. Signs is one of the best of its kind. I really can not understand that how this magnificent story doesn't deserve better. I think Signs must have been earned at least 7,5 points. 6,7 is too low for this piece of art. I really liked the alien concept but not all of the alien movies can make you this much scary. Signs is scary, and suspenseful at the same time. And how many movies you know that M. Gibson and J. Phoenix are both playing at the same project. They both are a legend! And you can see why when you are watching the movie. Signs is a classic, this movie is one of the few of its kind. They don't make horror movies like this anymore. M. Night Shyamalan was a genius director back in those days, but it is sad that he is not making horror movies like this anymore. But Signs will be a classic forever. And we will understand the quality of this movie much more when we will see the upcoming new generation horror movies. Making a classic horror movie is a hard thing. But Mr. Shyamalan achieve that by making Signs and The Sixth Sense.",Signs

The suspense is delivered at the exact dose each moment. There are not empty spaces lack of thrill and suspense. Your tension is kept at the right level.There are some top moments in the film that deserve to be pointed out, for example, the scene with the baby-watch radio; or the scene when "" the same show's on every channel"". To me, the screenplay is just a masterpiece.And what about the actors? It is a dream team. The casting is great, and the performances are excellent. We have to point out, of course, the astonishing work of Abigail Breslin (Bo Hess). This (then) barely six year-old little girl does just an overwhelming job, with a script that I'd say is too hard for any kid, not to mention the age. It's really astonishing.A turn-off of the film is the final outcome of the fight between a human and an alien. That makes the scene look somewhat like many low-category films.Another thing I dislike is the quality of special effects: I actually didn't see those smooth enough to be as excellent as the rest of the features in this film.As you watch the film you notice many other virtues: good direction, good dialogs, good photography... One thing about the dialogs is that they are real: you never find someone saying things that a normal person wouldn't.Everything in this film is perfectly balanced and flawlessly made.",Signs

The aliens are supposed to be technologically superior to us but still they try to capture humans with their bare hands. Where is the logic in that, there would have been tons of way to get the humans dead or alive.Also the motivations of the aliens are left really vague, which is clearly wanted but still it leave this kind of moral that nothing can harm us because god watch us. The aliens are merely the impersonal enemies that are there because they are evil and we the good one are going to defend ourselves because we are the good ones.The major plot problem in this movie is that nothing explain why the alien left, or at least nothing gave clear answers to this event. It is evident that water was the weak point of the aliens, but there is inconsistency in this. First inconsistence: the atmosphere is composed of a part of water. Second inconsistence: humans are composed of over 70% water so as most living creatures and plants. Third inconsistence: The planet is composed of 2/3 water, why would a supposed superior race show up on a planet mostly composed of water, to capture creatures that are composed of water and all that without protective suits.The movie in a global view isn't bad as long as you don't seek a logical sense in all that.",Signs

Night Shyamalan, an alien invasion movie based around a Christian family who will soon realize that aliens are invading earth and will soon invade their very own home. As I watched the movie (watched it 30 times approx.), the horror in the movie isn't as you would think. Here are my thoughts: Suspsense/Frightening 100%. The film was perfectly made to frighten everyone, and especially disturb you. Even adults get disturbed by the movie, because having the thoughts 7-foot tall aliens who can spray poison gas and invading earth is truly disturbing. Scenes in the movie such as the alien reflection on TV, the disturbing clip of the alien at the birthday party on the TV (Which was probably the scariest part in the movie), and the alien on the roof were jump-scares, and sure to take your heart down on a roller coaster. If you have children, they will most likely have nightmares or be afraid of this movie, ergo PG-13 for being frightening.Profanity, Obscenity 5%. There was hardly any profanity, except in one scene which was considered a comedic scene.Plots/Well-Designed 20%. Although the premise of the movie was good (alien invasion and what not), the plot wasn't. It made no sense at all for aliens to come to earth vulnerable to water, and the ending especially ruined the movie (even knowing it was tense).If you want to see a good suspense movie, yes, this is perfect for you.

It was an amazing movie with little amounts of plot twists-each getting more closer and nearer to the resolution than the one before.Crop signs is a very superstitious and mysterious thing. To use them in a movie is very rare, and very hard. The antagonist(s) in this movie have used these crop signs to work their way through. The protagonist, Graham, has been challenged by his faith. Likewise, his brother feels like he has to help the family, but no matter how he does it, it feels like he's being the opposite of help.This movie was very entertaining.

There are conflicts between an alien and the main character's family, and the story is about it. I really enjoyed this movie, because there was a final reversal and the ending was different with what I expected. I personally really liked this movie because the symbolism in this movie was kind of touching. Everything in the movie was all connecting, so I think the plot of the overall movie was good. One unique thing about director M. Night Shyamalan is that he always comes out as an actor in his movie. Whenever I watch his movie, I am always trying to find him out while watching the movie. Another unique thing about his movie is that when he is filming the movie, he uses lots of long shots other than short shots. I think these long shots make watchers to fall into the movie, because short shots make people hard to concentrate. I personally recommend this movie to Christians, because this movie's message is related to the religious thing. This movie shows and talks about faith in Christianity, but it can also be related to other religions.

Also, the symbol of water is pretty important in Signs, it signify the importance of having hope and guys quick facts about M. Night Shyamalan, In most of his movie water played an important role. Overall, I would say Signs was a pretty decent movie if you just want to watch it for entertainment which is okay, but it you are seeking for a movie that explain the importance of faith and the development of individuals overall this is a great movie. I would rate it as an 8 out of 10 because no movie is perfect, one thing I didn't like about Signs is the progress of the story, in my sense the story moves ""too"" slow, nothing much happened in some scene but it might be my own ""favor"" that a movie moves fast and have lots of stuff happened in a short period.Thanks for those who read it, and if you have any suggestions for me please commend (p.s. first time writing movie review).

Finally, when there was obvious proof that aliens came, there were people that evacuate to different places to be safe. However, our main character decides to stay in their home and wish for the best.This film is a mystery/thriller that allows the audience to think. The story line is not a straight forward story that the audience can understand without thinking. There are also constant actions that catches the attention of the viewer. This helps the audience to always be cautious and keeps them on their toes. There are also very meaningful messages and themes that is shown in this film. This is not an obvious thing that shows but there are plenty of hints that we can see.This is overall a very well-made film.

(After Signs, my chum & I decanted back to my place to enjoy Gremlins, which, while cheesy as all hell, at least wears its cheesiness with pride).  But Signs was so contrived in its foulness -- so smug in it's ""Ahhhh.

1476,MickC,Signs is Oscar worthy,8,4 August 2002,"While many fans of the Sci-Fi genre may not like Signs because it does not revel in the alien attack, Signs is an example of the best the genre has to offer. The plot revolves around a Reverend who has lost his faith after the brutally tragic death of his wife. He then has to find himself for his family while a War of the Worlds scenario starts to play out. Like Jaws, the monsters are effective because they exist in the shadows. If morons want to see people fighting anal probing space Nazis, go rent the crapfest that was Independence Day. Like many great movies, Signs works because it deals with larger issues which do not overshadow the basic premise. Shymalan's skill in weaving the two shows him to be one of the few gifted writers left in the field of film. Signs is an indescribable film that shows the evolution of Shymalan through The Sixth Sense, the under-rated Unbreakable and to Signs. I can not wait to see his next effort.",Signs
1477,cloudnin,Still waiting for a good film from Shyamalan,1,27 December 2002,"Warning: SpoilersThe first major idea presented is that crop circles really are of extraterrestrial origin. The true, hoax origin of crop circles is acknowledged in the film, and then quickly brushed aside by the fact that in a mere 72 hour period, 18 crop circles were made in India. Surely that is beyond the possibility of human behavior! Just do the math! In the film it says it would take a 2-3 person team 1 night to make a typical group of ""circles"" in a field. So over 3 nights, that would require 6 2-3 man teams, or a total of 12-18 people in on the hoax. This, in India, which has a population of over 1 billion people. Also, we are told that they are being used as ""markers"" for the extraterrestrials to use when their invasion begins. This, from beings who are obviously very technologically advanced, being able to travel at very high speeds across space. All that technology, and to remember where they want to go on Earth they're still relying on forming patterns in crops which will only be visible about half of each day.Next we are told that the extraterrestrials are probably here to take over the world in order to exploit its natural resources, having depleted their planet's natural resources already. This is believable enough, as if the film was set 200 years in the future, I can easily see it being turned the other way around, with humans as the invaders of the alien world. It's also suggested that the aliens will rely on hand to hand combat so that our nuclear weapons will not be of value in stopping them, which is another believable idea. Not content with believable ideas, it turns out that the only weapon the aliens have is the ability to emit a small amount of poison out of their wrists, having traveled across the galaxy and evidently forgetting to bring any serious weapons. Near the end of the film, without the aliens having made any real attempt to take over Earth, they inexplicably go back home, just as quickly as they came.
This film does raise some interesting questions, though.
At one point, the comment is made, first by Morgan, then a few moments later by the newscaster, that ""Everything people have written about in science books is going to change."" This is a rather profound statement, but it is probably false. While information from an advanced civilization might give a few insights that would have taken science a few more decades to find out, the bulk of chemistry, physics, geology, and even cosmology and astronomy would be unaffected. We might get a few more organism made elements at the end of the periodic table and a few refinements of current physics, but the rest of our knowledge of these subjects would more than likely be unchanged. Biology would probably be the most heavily affected science, as we'd have evidence of biological organisms that are possibly quite different from us, and this could shed great insight on common principles of Evolution throughout the universe.Also, while much attention is given to human beings and religion, the subject of religion is ignored in relation to the extraterrestrials, which is a source for many questions, such as: Were the aliens theists? While they were above the major cities in their cloaked space ships, were they praying to their God(s) for success in their invasion in order to claim what's left of Earth's natural resources? Or, perhaps the extraterrestrial invasion had nothing to do with our natural resources but rather was a cosmic proselytizing mission, in which the extraterrestrials, with empirical evidence for their God(s), were simply trying to share this evidence with us so we can stop worshiping our false Gods and start worshiping their true God(s).And perhaps most importantly, was ""swing away"" good advice, let alone so good that there was any reason for thinking it was of divine origin? That is, is there any good evidence to suggest that a God would have a man fall asleep at the wheel and kill an innocent woman so that she could utter the last words ""swing away,"" which would be interpreted by her husband, 6 months later, that this meant her son Merrill should beat an extraterrestrial in their living room to death with a baseball bat?  No. Merrill owned 5 records in minor league baseball, one of which was the record for the most strikeouts. He probably would have made it to the major leagues if he didn't recklessly `swing away' as he did. It is not plausible that without those last words Graham and Merrill would have been unable to defend their family. Indeed, it is amazing Merrill didn't grab the baseball bat much earlier in the film. Also, it would have been an ideal time to heed Colleen's last words when the family was in the basement by having Graham open the door suddenly and shine the light in the extraterrestrials eyes while Merrill swung away at the extraterrestrials head with the pickaxe.
In the end, the film isn't really about humans fighting off invading extraterrestrials or even extraterrestrials, but rather about using coincidences to support a belief in God. With this as the main premise, the whole extraterrestrials thing becomes not just completely superfluous, but incredibly deleterious to achieving this goal. For, if the writer's goal was to make a film about using coincidences to establish faith in God, then resorting to saying that a hodge-podge of hoaxes and unlikely ideas are also real diminishes this goal. Thus, instead of using extraterrestrials so that Colleen's last words can have divine meaning, it would be better to have a human burglar break into the Hess home, at which point Graham tells his son Merrill to ""swing away"" with a bat to protect the family. As is, this film provides nothing but silly, even if fanciful, ideas and scenarios about crop circles, extraterrestrials, and God.",Signs

The ET invasion and the idiotic ""green man"" alien are there only to serve the purpose of demonstrating God's existence and get the attention of simple minds.Very bad movie, does not deserve any analysis. Who can believe in these days that a civilization with superior technical skills will walk around the Earth nude, without special protection? What is the alien doing in the house alone, where are the others? and the spacecraft? If water kills them, how can they cope with the rain, for example?

1479,dabrowsa,Shyamalan out of ideas,2,10 August 2002,"Sixth Sense was based on a great idea, Unbreakable on a passable idea, but Signs doesn't seem to have any idea at all.  The aliens are ridiculous, Ed-Woodesque bogeymen, the little boy is irritating, and the tone is alternately flippant and maudlin, with not nearly enough of the former. Evidently Shyamalan was determined to make something really cool again, but the well was dry.  Maybe it's time for him to retire and rest on his laurels.",Signs
1480,jordy123,Creepy and Intelligent,9,1 August 2002,"After the wonderful Sixth Sense and the equally beautiful (but unfortunately less successful) Unbreakable, Signs is M. Night Shyamalan's third big movie. Like in his previous two movies, Night creates a world which rules have already been set a long time ago (Ghosts, Super Heroes, Crop Circles), and places identifiable characters in it. Signs works on two levels:On the surface, Signs keeps you on the edge of your seat for the full 110 minutes. Not because of the expensive special effects, big explosions or massive fighting-scenes (don't expect Independence Day II), but because you care for the characters, and you know just as much as they do about what's going on: almost nothing.If you want to look further, the movie deals with some of the same topics Night addressed in his previous movies: characters dealing with their place in the world, and how to accept the world they're faced with. It also, through the doubts of the former reverend played by Gibson, deals with the question of how people find or lose faith. The movie, however, never gets preachy, and lets the viewer decide for himself how to interpret the events Gibson witnesses.The ending is something different for Night: not a complete surprise as in his previous two movies, but still something you will be talking about when you walk out of the theater. The music is wonderful, the cinematography is beautiful, the acting perfect: Signs is one of the best movies of this year so far.",Signs
1481,ss_ajmani,Deserves to be seen in a theater,8,6 August 2002,"Manoj Night Shyamalan's newest film is also one that I like more than the other two he has made. Is it a better film than Sixth Sense and Unbreakable? I think so. Where I found Sixth Sense and its ending a bit gimmicky, and Unbreakable to be slower than molasses, Signs hardly ever tries to fool the audience with some weird twist, and it moves faster than Unbreakable, though not by much. And I like it that it's a fairly straightforward film. Some people are disappointed in this film. I can see why. Many expected a sci-fi thriller, but it's only part sci-fi thriller, and more of a personal-journey for the protagonist. I think if you keep that in mind before watching the movie, it will help you appreciate the movie and it's unfairly criticized ending a lot more. This is a good movie. A very good movie, with very good performances. I have never been a fan of Mel Gibson, but here he is just terrific. If there is one thing that Shyamalan does very well, it's getting his actors to project their very emotions onto celluloid. Everyone does a terrific job. Even the score is fantastic. It is one of the most memorable, most suspenseful scores I have heard in quite a while. I would also like to add, however, that Shyamalan is a writer/director whose style is really, I believe, an acquired taste. His dialogue often just sounds like dialogue, with little realism, and delivery of it is sometimes even less realistic. And his films move at a seemingly un-naturally slow pace. But films don't have to be realistic! They have to tell a story, and tell it well! And Shyamalan tells a very good story with Signs, and tells it very well. The film has many small flaws, but overall it's a real gem. ***1/2.",Signs

I give it a 6 out of 10.  Mostly because I think I'm supposed to have really like this movie.  Seems like some well spoken people, think they're supposed to as well.Mind you, I really thought that Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai were entirely overrated also.

I've never seen one that was this bad on purpose.  The various premises of the film are absurd and insult the intelligence of the sixth graders whom it was obviously written for.  I was tempted to see it by the approval it's director received in a weekly newsmagazine I subscribe to.  I will never trust them again.  And Roger Ebert has now lost my confidence as well.  I don't even want to talk about the details of the film except to see it was unremitting garbage (but the little girl was sure cute!).,Signs
1484,rnaroth,Great bold film making.,10,4 August 2002,"Great cinematic experience. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Shyamalan's way of story telling is quite special. He gives hope to a lot of beginners. Hey you dont need to spend megabucks on big studio sets or exotic locations or use special effects to create an effective movie. You need story telling skills, a good script and good acting. And of course some boldness to be different. Check out all his latest 3 movies. Bulk of the shots happen indoors. Cast is very minimal too.From reading some of the reviews here people are still expecting shyamalan to 'rise up' to matrix and independence day style of film making. Hey if you want eye candy, go watch starwars and mib. But if you want something with more substance, here is a guy that gives you stuff to think about. All of Shyamalan's movies had me thinking about his movie making even days after I saw it.On a side note, all his movies combined probably contains just one 'R' rated sentence. (Unbreakable: the crude sexual reference in the comic book store.). Aspiring filmmakers, take a deep breath. You dont need to fill your movie with 4 letter words and references. Here is your example. (Half the shorts in atomfilms.com or ifilm.com are r rated).Was signs scary? Oh yes. Good acting? defenitely. Very touching at some points. I have no complaints about the plot. Its irrelevent. Its the way he approached the subject that matters.Signs is a good movie. Just ignore the negative comments. Most people havent gotten out of the sixth sense hangover yet. Its probably the same people who compained about not able to see the CGI train crash in Unbreakable.Will Signs make money? You bet.

This is illustrated by a lot of whispering, soul-searching and annoying one-liner slogan conversations with his family. We got the obligatory ""smart kid"" as in the other Shyamalan movies, being very very serious, never smiling once throughout the movie. Also, the ""can't get to the medicine and will die"" situation from Panic Room, Con Air and heaps of other movies was added for increased excitement. The mood music was annoying, the camera work was the typical ""First film the people looking at something scary, then after too much waiting, show what they were looking at"". Aargh!

Signs is not a movie with over glorified violence to keep the interest of the viewer because the movie is far more exciting without it than with it.  Signs takes a different route than most movies.  This is not the fight of the military where we would get mindless action, but of an ordinary family and how they deal with these extraordinary circumstances that is going on in their world.

This is one you'll have to think about.Never assume that anything by M. Night is going to be simple. If you've watched the trailer (it was hard to miss- it was showing before almost every movie for the past year) then you probably assume that the title ""Signs"" refers to the crop circles, and the words flashed through the trailer, like ""a message"", are indicating that the crop circles are supposed to have an actual meaning. If you watch this movie and refuse to think about it, and instead choose to simply view it as a summer blockbuster, then you will be let down. M. Night wants you to think.*Possible Spoiler*If you think about the title after you've watched the movie, and think about what happened in the end (m. night always has his power moment at the end), then you might conclude that the title doesn't refer to the crop circles, and the ""message"" was meant for only one person.All said and done, you need to have faith that this movie is not what it seems on the surface.",Signs

Here, Shyamalan returns more to the form of The Sixth Sense, but the intricately woven plot suggests the complexity of his last movie, Unbreakable. In the first hour, Signs alternates between creepy and hilarious.  The movie manages to pack in quite a few good one-liners and sight gags, but for every laugh there is a moment that makes you jump.  The movie doesn't waste any time; the mysterious events start within the first few seconds.This movie can boast excellent performances from all involved.  Mel Gibson is well-cast as a grieving widower and minister who has lost his faith. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as usual, and the children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) are endearing. Signs only shows its weakness in the last 25 minutes, but any ending would suffer after the fantastic buildup that Shyamalan has put together.

They are capable of setting up an efficient navigation system (the circles), have advanced means of transportation (UFOs that can even become invisible), and are clever enough to send some scouts ahead to check out the place before sending over an army of aliens.Now this is where the problem lies. These scouts will surely have found out that they are vulnerable to water. They will also have noticed that on this planet water is basically every where. These aliens melt when it rains! Why would the scouts tell the others to come to earth, knowing that they are so vulnerable? Why didn't the aliens raid outdoor-stores and wear rain suits for protection? Or develop some efficient protection system against water touching their bodies? For intelligent beings from another world they seem pretty stupid to me.A nicely made movie, but a ludicrous plot.",Signs
1490,vohiyaar,Shyamalan at his very best,9,6 August 2002,"I watched a screening of Signs on the very first day it came out. I am absolutely stunned by the genius of Shyamalan's writing and direction.
On the outside this movie might be about extra-terrestrials and so on, but if you think about it enough you see the deeper philosophical message the movie sends out.Life is all about small things happening in a series of events and how they have a cumulative effect on the future. Every action anyone commits has its effects at some point in the future. Every situation that anyone goes through, however small, can be the difference between life and death!",Signs
1491,greensight,"A well crafted thriller, Shyamalan at his best",10,4 August 2002,"Signs is a sensational film, but like Sixth Sense and the less popular Unbreakable, it isn't for those without a sense of imagination. The story gets rolling when retired reverend Graham Hess (Gibson), along with his his two children and his younger brother Merill (Phoenix) discover a crop circle in their corn field. As the Hess family confronts their daily struggles, the tension mounts to an incredible climax as all the ""signs"" point to extra-terrestrial harassment.Gibson turns in a great and uncharacteristically soft performance as a faithless preacher, hollowed out by an the unfortunate death of his wife. Phoenix, who stood out in Gladiator as this millennium's creepiest villain, steals the show with a eminently likable character who often takes the edge off the suspense with a laugh line or a sight gag. We're used to seeing kids in Shyamalan's films, but in Signs he's given us two at once, and Rory Culkin and the adorable Abigail Breslin play off of each other very well.
The last character in the film is the setting. Location. Location. Etc. The atmosphere went a long way to making this the scariest film I've ever seen. Shyamalan is becoming adept at controlling an audience, holding a closeup for just long enough, and showing us exactly what scares us the most - sometimes everything, sometimes a little, sometimes nothing.This is a very different kind of movie than most people are used to seeing, from the quality of the writing, to the piecemeal exposition of the family's situation, to the camera work, and most of all because of the really daring nature of the subject matter. I read one review that called Signs derivative - no way. Shyamalan makes his own films, his own way. If you come out of it not knowing if you've just watched a sci-fi film or a drama, I think that's a fantastic feeling. Its a suspense film, no one should be confused about that, but the amount of warmth and humor that can fit into the gaps between the thrills is surprising.If you have the opportunity to see this in the theater, do it, especially if you liked both Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Bring friends so you can laugh when they laugh, and see it in a packed theater so when the audience gasps, you gasp with them. Rather than pick every line and every shot apart trying to figure out what kind of shocking revelation Shyamalan will dump on you at the end, just get lost in it, so that you can smile when it all comes together.",Signs

The movie story is a dream that the little girl (or Mel Gibson character himself, I am not clear) is having, and it is childish, not understandable, illogical because of this! we are given so many clues through the movie that I feel incredibly dumb for not having got this by myself (I got it from other people's review).

You might think that's a bad thing, and certainly the people I went to see it with thought so, but I liked it.  Far from being disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised.Without giving too much away, its proposition is an examination of how a fairly normal family might deal with the threat (real or imagined) of an alien invasion.  Naturally, the characters all have their hooks and foibles, and there is a crisis-of-faith subplot, but the central theme is tightly focused on a normal, vulnerable, rural family faced with a situation for which none of us would be prepared.  I enjoyed seeing the progress of the characters from the first interruption of their normal existence to conclusion and consequences.I particularly liked the way the whole thing was resolved without recourse to action hero shenanigans, despite Mel Gibson playing the lead.  Mel fans may be disappointed with this, and others may be disappointed with his attempts to portray ""tearful"", but his performance otherwise fitting.It was good to see that movie makers still exist not only willing to forego the quips and flying bullets but doing it in a way that kept me interested, excited and - yes - a little scared, for the entire duration of the film.",Signs

Night Shyamalan creates his second picture since break-out 'The Sixth Sense,' and his masterful control over an intricate blend of humor, suspense, and intimate drama produce another truly great movie.Signs starts fast, moves fast, and finishes fast; but the film-making techniques give the movie a thoughtful pace. A few breaks from the main plot to explore a sub plot add to this feeling of slowness, but they are necessary as Shyamalan develops his characters. For those of you expecting a monster movie/slasher-style thriller; the movie is more about the internal of the characters and the strength of a family, but any Sci-Fi junky will tell you - that's the heart and soul of any good Sci-Fi flick. In movies, events surrounding the characters only exist to better develop personalities - making the events futuristic or scientifically epic is the only thing that separates such movies as ""Sci-Fi."" Bottom line on this one...if you handled the pace of Unbreakable, you've got a shot at liking Signs. If you liked Unbreakable, you should like Signs.

1502,thronsop,"Nice Suspense, Awful Script",4,3 September 2002,"My hat is off to the director, who crafted this movie with the idea to duplicate the suspense of an old twilight zone episode or Hitchcock thriller. While he succeeded at creating the sense of fear and the surreal I hadn't felt since Stephen King's Cat's Eye, he forgot to create a movie around the suspense with enough coherency to suspend the belief of a 21st century audience. All I kept thinking was the characters could have been so much more with so little effort and while very funny at times, the dialogue was forced and contrived and didn't fit like I great movie does. Ultimately however, the failure of this movie was the terrible science-fiction. I'm not complaining that we didn't hear an explanation to the mystery and incredulous visitors and their methods, what I'm p***ed off about is that I paid good money to see a movie where air breathing aliens (which largely consists of water) are also harmed by it --- must be they only dislike it in liquid form, eh? Funny how the aliens avoid the lake, but fly in clouds too. These aliens are intelligent enough to fly trillions of miles, and possess technology that we cannot dream of, yet one cannot get out of a flimsy locked pantry. Please don't brandish me as `not getting it' and one of those people who fall into the group that at my core must fear, rather than hope, that's not it. Maybe I am a bit mad that I was alienated because I choose to believe that luck is luck; maybe I think it is a bit indulgent that God choose to give Mel advice about how to save his family, while in the meantime millions were being abducted and killed by the aliens (maybe they weren't Christians?), but mostly I am mad that this movie was good is so many areas that so few aren't and was so bad in places it didn't have to be.",Signs

The ideas of faith and redemption in the face of tremendous personal loss are the elements that drive this story. It's a hybrid genre. Shyamalan's wraps his primary message in suspense thriller, and there are plenty of bumps in the night. The mise-en-scene and production design is incredible, and there are plenty of gems in the cinematography and acting too. This is some of Shyamalan's best.It's true that the alien invasion logic is not utterly thought out. They make some serious mistakes. But look at America in Iraq, or Vietnam for Christ's sake. Never underestimate the power of hubris.If anyone feels like complaining about this film, it's because they got something different from what they expected. When will Shyamalan's marketing team learn to stop promoting his films like teen slashers? They are intellectual thrillers and if you go in knowing that, you're in for a terrific piece of drama.",Signs
1508,branyan,Another piece of genius..,10,2 August 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan is fastly becoming my favorite filmmaker.  In Signs, he again masterfully creates a spellbinding tale of an ordinary man (or boy as in the Sixth Sense) in an extraordinary situation.  Shyamalan uses all the subtle tools of filmmaking to slowly turn the dramatic screws on the audience.  He also displays his ability to somehow hold a key plot point right in front of your face without you realizing until it's payoff at the end.  Signs is frightening, poignant, and even has very good humor.  This film has all the elements that an intelligent audience could want.  To those who don't enjoy this and Shyamalan's films, I suggest maybe going to a film that doesn't require much use of your mind.  Something with lots of BOOM BOOM and such.

The thrill factor of this movie wasn't any good either. Not to mention, the fact that things didn't add up greatly hurt this movie. In order to combat the problem of highly intelligent and hostile beings from entering their home I would think one would have to go through a lot more trouble than to club it a couple of times and throw a glass of water in its face. I did, however, enjoy the acting of both the adults and the children in this movie. The emotional intimacy of the family and their crippling past made me tear up more than once. The light humor also made it that much more enjoyable. I think it would have been best if Shyamalan had just taken the whole faith issue and ran with that instead. As a psychology enthusiast I would have been very interested. I can't stress how much of a distraction the ""aliens"" are to the true meaning behind this movie! It could have been much more successful and memorable, but instead it's shoved into the ""what if aliens exist?"" category along with all the others. Just for having aliens in it! Even the physical appearance and behavior of the aliens were cliché. In the beginning the movie is very intriguing but I feel as if they didn't know how to continue in that direction or they'd think a much more complex plot would take too much time and effort but in the end it just hopelessly collapsed.

The director is the same one as the Sixth Sence and he does as good if not more. The acting is superbly acted. Mel Gibson and the bad guy from Gladiator do there best jobs in Signs.

To me it has more value because of the sentiments it transmits, rather than the obvious mistakes and holes in the story line. Because we do not have an answer for what aliens actually can or can't deal with, I can forgive the assumption that they did not know water was bad for them. I can forgive the fact that they could not get through a wooden board. I can even forgive the CGI effects, because to me this movie transmitted a message deeper than its surface.

Night, Mel and company, this film wasn't trying to be ridiculous. This movie would have been MUCH better had it stayed with the ""unseen menace"" approach. That worked well in another fialed film effort: IT. The first half of the movie is solid and then it just falls apart when the threat is solidified and made real. Unfortunately, this is even worse. There is NO explanation why aliens, who can cross interstellar space, are vulnerable to the most common substance on the planet they invade or why they are apparently incapable of harming human beings.Another commenter says this is a movie about faith.

Thumbs up for Shyamalan!",9,3 August 2002,"I have adopted the opinion that many of the people giving such scathing reviews to this movie were instead waiting to see ""Independence Day 2"" or some other computer effect-ridden insubstantial character drivel of the same sort.In fact, this movie is nothing like the in-your-face, look-how-many-millions-we-can-spend, typical sci-fi movie that movie-goers have been exposed to lately.This flick has style. This flick knows how to reach into your chest and twist. This movie is a roller coaster of emotions... taking you from curiosity in the premise, to compassion for the family, to concern about the building sci-fi overtones, to almost utter heartbreak at the pain this family has suffered, right up through sheer terror, and finally into a resolution that, contrary to much opinion here on IMDB, I thought was brilliantly done and had plenty of meaning for my tastes.There is a particular scene toward the end of the movie where I felt my eyes almost welling up over the sadness on-screen, and in a single instant, with nothing more than the reaching of an arm and the tugging of a shirt, was into a hilarious laugh. Two minutes later, I was about to jump out of my seat again with suspense, set off by Shyamalan's genius using a baby monitor as a suspense device.'Signs' grasped my attention and held it throughout the movie. The acting was incredible throughout. Abigail Breslin almost steals the movie away as the adorable little Bo Hess. Rory Caulkin and Joaquin Phoenix each turn in commendable performances. Even Shyamalan himself in a cameo role is believable in his plight. Gibson, of course, always hits his mark.As far as the deus ex machina ending of the movie being written about here, what people are describing as the contrived ending had nothing to do with the real action that resolved the overall sci-fi conflict in the movie. My guess is that they failed to understand the ending in their disappointment over not seeing Randy Quaid piloting an F-14 into the mothership.If what you want to see is F-14s dog-fighting with flying saucers, a minimum of $30 million spent on special effects, and scenes of millions of aliens swarming over the landscape and being blasted into orange goo -- wait for Independence Day 2.If you like movies that rely more on your own imagination to create suspense and thrill rather than having someone program your imagination for you, and would rather be treated to a thoughtful reflection on the human overtones of sci-fi stories over the pervasive special effects of 21st century movie-making... go see Signs.

1518,steck_n6,Signs,7,19 September 2006,"Signs (2002) Director: M. Night ShyamalanGraham Hess (Mel Gibson) has made an astounding discovery: giant crop circles have mysteriously appeared in his cornfields overnight, and all the evidence suggests that they are extra-terrestrial or aliens in nature. Without warning, these unexplainable signs begin to pop up all over the globe, and the entire world is suddenly faced with a unique event: aliens from another world may be coming, and no one knows their intentions. Hess is an ex-reverend who experiences a huge crisis of faith after the horrific and untimely death of his wife. Living with Hess are three members of his broken family: his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed baseball player who lacks discipline, which kept him out of the major league; his son Morgan (Rory Culkin), a young boy afflicted with health problems; and his daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin), a little girl who is curiously paranoid. When Hess and his kin are confronted with the threat of an alien invasion, the failures and heartbreaks of the family comes to the surface in a volatile mixture of blame, guilt, and anger.Questions of faith, belief, and hope are all raised and explored in what is a thrillingly, terrifying, and satisfying film. Yes, this movie is about aliens, and yes this movie is intense, scary, and all the other great things you may or may not expect out of this type of film. Nevertheless, this movie is also about faith and family. Signs is about finding meaning and hope whatever we might face in life.M. Night Shyamalan is the unthinkable. You can never expect an original film out of him. Either you like his movies or you do not. In any of the films in which he directs he pulls the twist and turn technique. This unique technique should tell you that he is by far out of the ordinary when it comes to directing a movie.

1519,Boxturtle7,Alien invasion movie with great style and no common sense,5,4 September 2006,"An invasion by an an advanced alien race who come in an invisible spacecraft - Earth is in big trouble, right? Wrong! Luckily, these are the dumbest aliens in the history of cinema. First of all, they leave huge location markers known as crop signs from which the movie gets its name. These aliens, despite superior technology, don't seem to know they could stop at a store and get a GPS locater for a few hundred bucks that conveniently tracks anywhere on the planet down to the square yard. Next, they are allergic to water. Good old H2O reacts on their bodies much as hydrochloric acid would. Add to that, they come down naked with no protective devices and choose to invade Pennsylvania where it rains a lot. I gather they didn't happen to notice on their approach from space that earth is covered with 80% water. So that gives humans a big advantage, right? Well, yes. But unfortunately, the aliens invade the only known section of rural Pennsylvania where nobody owns any guns. Anywhere else in America, every farmhouse has at least a rifle or a shotgun but these residents defend themselves with aluminum foil helmets, knives, and baseball bats. Luckily, this is offset by the fact that the aliens' only weapon is a poison sprayer that travels about a foot and a half. That seems oddly primitive for a race capable of interstellar travel and invisibility. Despite an inane plot, a lack of explosions, and no sexual content, this movie is worth seeing. It has alternately surprising chills, suspense, laughs, and tenderness. The redeeming qualities come from superior direction, great acting, and a strong theme (faith), proving once again that people will buy absolutely anything if it's packaged right.",Signs

There have been many movies like this, whether it's a volcano (Dante's Peak, Volcano), tornado (Twister), flood (Hard Rain), meteor (Armageddon, Deep Impact), and now aliens.  The only thing that made this movie different was it had M. Night Shyamalan's trademark epiphany scene.

What I found, though, is that the spiritual aspects of the movie actually made it moving.  That's what I found so amazing about this.  Ask yourself when was the last time you found yourself even a little bit emotionally moved by a sci-fi film.  I've seen several other users comment on this being the downfall of this movie, but it was undoubtedly its strongest point, the one that makes it stand out above and beyond the other two films.  Night's ability to merge these two genres together seamlessly was incredible, and the fact that you didn't quite get it until the last five minutes was nothing short of brilliant.  Quite simply, this is one of the smartest films I've seen in a long time.  I actually feel a little bad for the reviewers who just didn't get it.

However, after watching a screening of it I was left somewhat confused.The sci-fi element of the film left much to be desired as it was practically non-existant until the last 10 minutes. In fact, it seems to be thrown in there for the sake of adding some special fx and getting interest from the public eye.The films director (M Night Shyamalan) got himself off to a great start with The 6th sense, then met with mixed reviews over Unbreakable; a film which took a great deal of time to get to it's point but payed off in the end with one of Shyamalan's surprise thought provoking endings. I was half expecting the same thing from this film about half way through(a long subtle trail to a great finish) but this was not the case.Instead, the film drags on and on in a slow build up fashion which leads to a great deal of nothing. If that thought provoking ending is in there, I must have missed it. I suppose it was left forgotten, boarded up the house with the many glasses of water, a baseball bat, and a a holy man whose lost his faith.Signs does give a good performance from Gibson and fair performances from the rest of the cast, including Shyamalan himself (who actually played an important plot character).

Yes, the director and the actors do a fine job, but the story is silly. How can a movie be great if its plot is downright silly. One example for readers of this to ponder is the purpose of the crop circles in the movie - what if there are no crops, what do they do? What if the farmer mowed the fields after the crop circles appeared? Why weren't they using the stars or satellites or ground-based beacons or even maps and photographs?While watching it, I could not help wondering whether Signs was intended to be a comedy or not. I'm still not sure. My hope is that Shyamalan made Signs to find out just how far his skill as an director could carry him on its own, without any help from the plot. I hope the next film he does has a plausible and well-written plot, one that does not rely on tricks such as the one in The Sixth Sense.

Which makes his films much more mysterious and curious, because you look for him and it brings you deeper into the movie...in some very very peculiar way.  But back to the film...I don't know how Night thinks of these stories, these are amazing and fresh ideas and it seems like he is going to be in everyone's mind for time to come.  His films are beginning to push the envelope in these Sci Fi/thriller genre's and also in genuine films overall. As much as his films are slow...pacing wise, it only leads to much much more suspense and concludes the ending with conflict and shocking value that makes it much much more intense.  I believe that ""Signs"" is one of the best films of this summer and the best from this amazing director.

And while the obvious theme is the small family's struggle against the dark forces that threaten their lives, the deeper themes of faith, love and loss ring true and provide a richness that is hard to find in most of today's films.No movie has made my heart pound quite as quickly as it did during this one. M. Night creates an atmosphere where fear of the unknown and imaginations run wild, builds tension quicker than any slimy scary looking alien could. His use of long shadows and unknown sounds make the tension rise, just as he brings you back down with smooth easy humor delivered by Mel Gibson's wry wit or through the antics of his brother (Joaquin Phoniex) and children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin).I recommend this movie as much for its fabulous story telling as for its fantastic filming.

It takes half of the movie for it to get past boring talk and uneventful scenes.Once the movie does get going, it has a few suspenseful scenes that make you anticipate an amazing ending, but leaves you at the edge of your seat wondering what happened to the rest of the film.The only good aspect of this movie is the great acting from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix.  The film could have been so much more.  I give it a 4 out of 10.",Signs
1544,kem,Spoiler,3,18 August 2002,"One word describes this film best: boring.  The plot was bland to non-existent, the action was so slow I almost fell asleep twice.  And who decided to cast the writer/director/producer as an actor - it must have been the same idiot who came up with this stupid movie in the first place.  I loved 'Sixth Sense', was so-so on 'Unbreakable' but I almost demanded my money back on this one (I wish someone had twisted my arm to make me see this one, then I'd have someone to blame other than myself)The end was so predictable that I fail to see how this can be categorized as either a mystery or a thriller.  For future reference, when the writer/director/producer casts himself in a movie to deliver the prophesy that he's going to the lake because the aliens must not like water, you can pretty much take his word for it - after all, he wrote the thing, he should know.",Signs

1546,afanzo,Wonderful Filmmaking,9,4 August 2002,"I saw Signs this evening and it was simply marvelous.  A grand exercise in story telling, M. Night Shymalan crafts this story like a true master. The action and suspense starts right away when Hess (Mel Gibson) discovers Crop Circles in his Corn Field (corn fields are not a good thing unless your name is Kevin Kostner). This is the beginning of a great buildup, with a dramatic climax that rivals 6th Sense. The suspense is riveting  throughout with great acting by all involved.  If you enjoy character development, suspense, and a strong story you will enjoy Signs.  This is not E.T. 2, Signs is multi layered with the aliens as just a backdrop.  I highly recommend it.",Signs

1548,gaylensquire,A great postmodern sci-fi film,9,10 August 2002,"*possible spoilers* I find it interesting that those who are members of the postmodern generations (x-ers and millennials) find this movie more appealing then the boomers and others.  Perhaps it's because this movie is not about how our scientific minds and weapons destroy the invading forces, but rather how faith and love overcome adversity.  It's really not a movie about aliens invading at all.  It's a movie about finding your place in the world, and remembering what's important.  (Much like Unbreakable... which too was a great postmodern movie)Signs is great and scary because we are taken into the life of an every day family, and are forced to witness the happenings in the world through their eyes.  It is scary because we only know what they know, which is very little.  And the scariest part... which many have disliked, was the end, when the aliens just up and left.  Why?  Because we still don't know.  Did they really leave, or is it a trick.  And when Gibson's character unplugs the t.v., it became even scarier.  The only link to the outside world is severed, and suddenly we are made to feel uneasy again.  Shamaylans genius is in his ability to scare us simply by unplugging a t.v.I mentioned the ending, and how most people gripe about it.  But seriously, what do you want.  Would it have been better if there was an Independence Day type battle, or Mel Gibson running out with the family, and kicking some alien ass.  Or how about a surprise ending where we discover, as has been suggested by some, that the little girl is an alien, and she protects them. Or maybe she turns on them.  (I'm picturing the scene in Night of the Living Dead in the cellar with the young girl stabbing her mother with a gardening spade)  Personally, I thought the ending was perfect.  We don't get to see the fight.  We don't get to see the aliens poisoning people.  We only know what the family knows.  They are just as confused as us, because they don't know any more than us.  To go outside the boundaries of their experience would be to ruin the genius of the film, and destroy the suspense.Go to this movie not because you want to see an alien movie.  Go because you want to see a movie about a family and their struggle to overcome adversity in their lives.  You will get scarred along the way.  Consider it a bonus.",Signs

It's terrible...really terrible.  This is by far the most unimaginative science fiction movie in a long time.  The aliens offer no surprises except for the fact that they are built from the same mold that we are used to.  The dialogue is completely awkward and offers little insight into the characters. All of the supposedly scary scenes resort to lame tricks for shock effect, like black outs and not showing anything that is happening.  I even caught a glimpse of the microphone in one seen.  Don't waste your time, this movie is one of the worst i have seen in a long time",Signs
1551,higherflyer3,Symbolism in Signs,8,19 May 2014,"|Contains Spoilers|I need to share this particular theory that appeals to me more than any other popular critique of the movie and of the director, or even any misjudged 'praise' based on a naive surface reading, in place of a deeper visceral analysis of symbolism in Signs. The issue with the water killing aliens and the viewer's prideful assumption that this particular ""plot hole"" is beneath them because of its seemingly simplistic nature, watch the movie again and think of the water as ""holy water"", and keep in mind that the little girl was called an ""Angel"" upon her birth. She is the bearer of the holy water, scattering water glasses around the house.Think beyond the idea of ""aliens."" Things that are ""alienated"" to the mind, are perceived as dangerous, frightful and even demonic. Think about demons in mythology and religious texts. Note when the radio announced that they came up with a way to ""fight them back"" in the Middle East, the provenance of the Abrahamic religions. This is the demon that the priest has to face. He is being examined for the deep- seated organic nature of his faith that still resides within him, rethinking meaning behind seemingly unnecessary events that happened in his life. The idea of a substance such as water that was sufficient in demolishing aliens NEEDED to be simplistic. It is a notion within not only Christianity but most spiritual traditions that water is the source of purity, washing away dirt and basically anything and everything that comes in its way. Be it man's sins, or obstacles to salvation. All the while being something so ordinary and within reach.And lastly, the title ""Signs"", I think is a reminder of the ""Signs and Wonders"" school of thought. The idea that the teachings of Christianity and the Gospel can be communicated more effectively when associated with phenomenons of a metaphysical essence, or of the ""unknown.""Fear of the unknown is a truly powerful thing! There is so much to explore in Signs, including the many uses of reflections and iconography but I leave that to others.Lastly, I am clueless as to what Shyamalan himself believes in. I know that he went to a Christian school while being Hindu. He sure as heck insists on advocating religion. Nonetheless, he had a vision and I hope he comes back strong!",Signs
1552,jimhunter99,Signs is One Great Classic,10,4 August 2002,"I read some of the posts here and I noticed many people who hated the film simply expected an X-Files episode, but my friends Shyamalan does not work that way, go see Six Sense and Unbreakable again to figure out the genius mind behind those films, or may be see some works of X-files director Rob Bowman titled ""Reign of Fire"" to see the difference.I loved Signs for the story, the acting and the marvelous camera and soundtrack works...needless to say ....I can't wait for his next film already. Way to go Night, we believe you're one great American storyteller...",Signs
1553,MMLehnert,Scariest movie ever with brilliant actors,10,23 September 2002,"I've read many comments about this movie and many seem to have missed what this movie was about. Most who gave the film a bad rating complain about aliens who act not logically, about bad acting, about a bad plot and so on... First who on earth wants to say that he fully understands an absolutly unknown alien race? There are no hints in the movie why or from where they came, we just know that they are hostile. I cannot understand those guys who think that all aliens have to look like humans and think like humans with a specific trait (like in Star Trek). I see no reason why a brutal but technologically advanced alien species shouldn't be doing any mistakes (even grave ones!) Humans are the best example that sometimes they are intelligent and sometimes stupid beyond imagination.To the actors: All acting was brilliant, and if you ever witnessed people under enormous stress or in panic, than nothing the protagonists did seems ridiculous or unbelievable. The dining scene where Mel Gibsons freaks out is absolutly terrifing because you can see the terror of the occuring dangers in the way the protagonists behave.The plot: All the plot is about the feeling of lonelyness. A familiy lives far away from other persons and far away from big cities in the middle of nowhere, the main protagonist has become distanced from god and when the aliens arrive this terrible feeling of being alone is rising to a unbearable level when the tv-stations stop airing and the hushing feet of stranges can be heard outside the doors. Of course the director is spicing everything up with a certain moment of realization in the end. The film is terrifying and scary, and when being confronted with these poor beings when all hope is falling to pieces and the end of the world seems to be imminent all your own problems suddenly seem to be insignificant. The film is able to convey the terror of the protagonists directly to the viewer, and therefore it's a masterpiece of modern horror-movies. Just don't watch this movie if you never let yourself emotionally influenced by a movie and if you are unable (or unwilling) to understand and sympathize with people in deep trouble. 10 out of 10.",Signs

1556,chris-766,Another corker from Hollywood's new Hitchcock/Spielberg (delete as appropriate),10,10 September 2002,"The first thing you need to know about Signs is that it is not for everybody. Certainly not for those who hated Unbreakable. The slow, measured pacing, the lack of real ""action"", the dialogue-heavy character scenes - all are present and correct in Shyamalan's latest. And why not? Personally I found Unbreakable to be an understated, underrated cult classic, and I see absolutely no reason why Signs should not be elevated to such status.The second thing you need to know about Signs is...nothing else! Seriously, this particular cinematic dish is best served cold - the less you know, the better. One of the greatest pleasures in cinema is going to see a film not knowing quite where it will take you - something which, in these days of plot-spoiling trailers, is all too rare, and something which that sly trickster Shyamalan is all too keen to play on.Any pre-conceived ideas anyone may have about Signs will probably be blown away by the time the film reaches its final act, which, despite what some critics may say, is just as thrilling as the first two thirds. During the hour and forty five minutes I was in the cinema, I did not take my eyes off the screen ONCE, I laughed several times, and jumped just as much. The sheer gut-wrenching tension made me grasp my arm rest, and the emotion made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck on more than one occasion. I really don't expect much more from a film than that.Onto the acting then, and the performances, without exception, are superb - Shyamalan again drawing winning displays from the two young children. Phoenix proves what a tremendous range he has with a brilliantly subtle performance, whilst Gibson underplays his troubled patriarch beautifully.So, Shyamalan has now made three blockbusters, all of which have been intelligent, exciting, thought-provoking and enjoyable. Shouldn't he get some kind of award for that?*****",Signs

1558,wileymiester,"A great, possibly a classic",10,3 August 2002,"To be completely honest, I feel that Roger Ebert gives a great review of this movie.  Usually I disagree a lot with him, but in this case he is right on the mark. A lot of people are trying to drag this movie through the dirt because of Shyamalan's self-absorbed idea's that he is going to be the next Hitchcock. Usually I would have a problem with this but I have to say that he has completely delivered in all of his movies.  And Signs is absolutely no exception.  The movie has a lot of twists and turns and I'm not going to waste time explaining the plot since you can get that elsewhere.  I just felt the need to tell everyone who might want to see this movie that it will be more than worth your time. One things I'd like to say before I leave is that music in this movie worked absolutely beautfully, it makes my eyes water just thinking about it.  An absolute masterpiece to say the least.",Signs
1559,Dupajeuda,Surprisingly Good,10,3 August 2002,"After reading several reviews of this movie before attending a screening last night, I figured ""Signs"" had a 50\50 shot of entertaining me. Unfortunately, once again I placed far too much credibility in the hands of movie critics.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, from start to finish.  The mood Mr. Shyamalan creates is at times quite intense.  If you are the type of person who can't sit still and enjoy the moments of a movie that don't include vulgarity and excessive violence, this movie is not for you. However, if you are the type of moviegoer that can appreciate a nicely woven tapestry of ominous dramatic anticipation, without the lapses in pace that plague so much of what modern movies have become, I highly recommend this movie for you.  The cast turns in a wonderful and moving performance.  Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are spectacular.  M. Night Shyamalan does not allow you to leave the theater unfulfilled if you keep in mind one simple concept; true catharsis as it relates to the movie-going experience is rarely achieved through the spectacle of overwhelming special effects.  Go see this movie.",Signs
1560,Handstanz,Shyamalan's Best-- A Masterpiece,10,12 December 2007,"Signs is one of the most touching, thought-provoking films I have seen in years. It is Mel Gibson's best movie since Lethal Weapon, and an amazing piece of art by M. Night Shyamalan. What Shyamalan does with his films is so much more intelligent and awe-inspiring than the dreadfully meaningless films we see today, that filmmakers like Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis should be embarrassed to say they work in the same business as him.To call Signs a thriller is wrong. Watch it with your kids, your entire family. It is on of those movies where you don't just watch it, you experience it. And after it is finished, you will want to see it again. Signs is about a former pastor who now lives on his farm with his children and brother, whom is helping him out after a family tragedy. One morning, they wake up to find an enormous crop circle in their corn field. Once these begin popping up across the globe, strange things begin happening. Signs is the story of one family who face their fears, their past, and the terrifying present as the world is being invaded No you might have read that thinking ""Oh boy another alien flick"". This is NOT an alien flick. I wont even say if aliens appear in the movie--because it doesn't matter. What this film plays on is not special effects, loud explosions or extreme-action sequences; it is something entirely different. Quiet. Never has there been a film where silence is more scary. M. Night Shyamalan is one masterful director. He can get an audience to cry so brilliantly--I have never seen so many people cry in one theater Please, do yourself a favor, and see this movie. Its got one of the greatest endings of any movie I've seen, and as one last tip--don't think about all the technical stuff when its over Just enjoy it You will be glad you did",Signs
1561,disneycrazee,It Happened,10,4 August 2002,"I discovered 'signs' in late December/early January, causing me to wait a seemingly unhealthy and extremely drawn-out seven months.  Many would assume that because of the excitement that was gradually built within me, only disappointment could follow my viewing of the movie (mainly because I had such high expectations).  I rushed to the theater opening day, and I must say, my excitement only heightened by the end of the movie.Naturally, trailers and commercials expose this crop circled movie as a supernatural thriller, but M. Night Shyamalan himself is careful to note that the center of the movie is really on one's faith rather than crop circles, aliens, or anything related to such.  'Signs' is a mixture of things: humor, emotion, frightening elements, and a factor found in some of the scariest of movies--silence.  Just before actually seeing the film, I found myself slightly worried that the word 'alien' found its way in.  It made me somewhat skeptical because I thought that the presence of extraterrestrials would fail to effectively deliver the message that Shyamalan so intended.  However, he is a pure genius and I wonder how I ever doubted him.  With pure intelligence, which seems to be lacking in so many movies these days, he makes everything work, slowly releasing information to the audience and finally tying all of the ends together at the very end. Though it may not have the kind of 'surprise' ending like 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable,' it has one all its own and nothing can replace it.  The secret is not to release too much information too early because 'Signs' is meant to keep you guessing and to experience it with your own eyes, or rather, own mind.  The performances delivered by Joaquin Phoenix:), Mel Gibson, Rory Culkin, and adorable Abigail Breslin are memorable and only add to the strength of 'Signs.'  It will most likely be a box office winner, but more importantly, it will be put on the list of 'smart' and challenging movies.",Signs

Although the whole cast does an excellent job playing their parts, and every emotion can be felt throughout the movie, I didn't enjoy the plot enough to truly be moved.

This film features the most useless ALIENS that ever appeared in a major SCI-FICTION movie. It is hard to imagine an alien travelled millions of miles across the galaxy to conquer the Earth but cannot breakdown a door and afraid of water.  I like Mel Gibson even this is not his normal action film and there is a lot of extreme closeups (so if you are obsessed with Mel Gibson then this film is a gem). Night Shyamalan tried hard to make a punch line (similiar to what he tried on Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) repeating throughout the movie -- ""Tell Merill to hit ...""

Never mind the rationale of the actions taken by reverend Graham and his family in this emergency situation.All the above mentioned elements of the plot (complete with the isolation of a barn-like home next to a cornfield) are merely nice clichés, familiar for any movie-goer. Can anyone think Shyamalan wants to be original here? No. He just uses these blocks (and in a tongue-in-cheek manner, too!) to create an instant ambiance of suspense and retell a universal story. The story of purpose in life.Human purpose is an underlying theme in all major works by Shyamalan, Unbreakable and Lady In The Water being his most obvious attempts to elaborate on it. Out of these movies, Signs delivers the simplest and most convincing answer.Yes, you do have a purpose in life. Yes, suffering through a major crisis gets you closer to it. (In fact, this may be the only way you ever open up your eyes to see.) And yes, at one point, you will suddenly and unexpectedly understand the master plan.This all is told very simply yet quite powerfully in Signs.

However this was one of those films during which I just kept looking at my watch to see how much more I had to sit through.  The underlying themes were isolation, faith, and attitude to life. The isolation would seem to contrast with other impending disaster films in which humanity is drawn together, but this self-absorbed family seem to be experiencing their own crisis. A loss of faith is something I've witnessed many people experience, but once lost it takes extraordinary events to restore it, so I suppose the film was accurate in that respect.The acting was OK with Mel Gibson playing against type, but a different lead actor might have brought a bit more to the role.There were a few decent shock moments, but on the whole I found the film exceedingly dull.",Signs

It brought me back to my own comic book days, and again made me obsess about becoming a super-hero when I grow up. When I first saw the preview for Signs I couldn't wait, but I had to until now.  Whoever says a single bad thing about this movie should go straight to hell and back.  I was amazed, not only by the exciting and meaningful plot, but by every aspect of direction and cinematography.  Shyamalan is just getting better with time, and I hope it never stops.  I was never able to fully sit back in my seat, I knew I had to be ready to jump at anytime, and those parts that did make me jump were never in vain. For the most part, sci-fi movies have always disappointed me with the look of the actual aliens.  Signs did not.  It must have been the way Shyamalan built us up to be ready for them, seeing a shadow first, then a leg, then a hand, and finally the entire body, all shown in a very scary manner.

All the other times, they never showed anything (except for a few hands). Big deal.2) It seemed the director would gain momentum with a tense scene, but would then ruin it by throwing in some pointless comedy.

Simple, if they simply just over powered us so easily then they'd end up gettin nuked, plus they could have also just stopped by to harvest a few million humans for food, fuel, etc. hence they didnt plan on staying and didnt need to break out all their weapons. How did the alien with the chopped off hand know where Father Grahams house was? Perhaps that alien was the one who was at his house nights before, and saw him. After his hand was chopped off he simply just went back and tried to repay him. I gave this EXCELLENT movie a 10 outta 10",Signs

1578,dashe@attglobal.net,Good execution of a very weak plot,4,21 August 2002,"This is a beautifully made movie, Shyamalan is clearly a good director as he brings out solid work from his actors, and creates a suspenseful and even somewhat insightful film from a B-movie plot. The cinematography is beautiful as well. However, the plot is weak, no matter the angle one sees it from. Is it a film about a person's quest for spirituality and meaning in life's twists and turns? Is it a film about aliens? Whichever one of the two somewhat ill-fitting plot lines is so superficially developed as to be laughable. The alien plot line is so full of holes that I found myself laughing out loud.Pity, as the director clearly has a lot of talent at creating a consistent atmosphere of tension through clever management of subtlety (which is refreshing). I see Shyamalan also wrote this film. He should stick to directing only. Not a film I would recommend to anyone. Maybe on video.",Signs
1579,Goblin Imp,Blew my mind,10,20 January 2003,"This movie completely blew my mind.  I could literally feel the plot lines and threads coming together in my head, it was like a physical sensation. It was certainly helpful that I saw it on DVD so I had the option of going back and seeing what I had missed. I thought this was excellently done.  The beginning may seem slow, but the movie plays on the natural human fear of something we can't see.  The plot was incredibly original, considering the movie's premise is one of the most worn out alien cliches of our time.  I would definitely recommend it, whether you're a fan of scary movies or think that it won't be scary enough. Just stay alert, don't doze off.  It's the details that are really amazing.",Signs

1581,oceandirector,Awesome; for me Shyamalans best work.,9,20 February 2009,"Shyamalan focus's on various aspects of UFO's and Aliens, but Signs also has a great sub- plot which delves into religion, family, and love. Many people accuse this film of being quite boring, but thats due to people thinking its going to be some sort of 'Invasion' action horror which it isn't. The structure and content of the script is very clever, as the narrative cuts to different plot lines. Once again Shyamalan has the power to use various techniques of suspense that produced so very scary scenes. Thumbs up to James Newton Howard who produced the score, it improves the 'fear' element so much.The only thing I didn't like about Signs was the special effects of the water catching the Alien on the shoulder. Its a shame they couldn't make that look a little more realistic. Overall, an awesome film that in my opinion was the best in 2002. (Lets just say its better than the happening).",Signs

A very bad movie secretly disguised as a movie about 'FAITH'. Yeah right. There are only two moments in Signs that made me jump, great enough to think there are signs of talent in such a conceded director. But the tension and suspense it manages to amount to pretty much.... NOTHING. The climax involves a man beating the alien to death and spraying him water. Wow, this took my breath away in all the wrong ways. Horrible Horrible movie. Thank god I didn't pay for SIGNS, ironic since I believe that faith has saved me from spending 10 bucks. I was also disappointed that the crop circles are only featured once in the entire movie. I think they would have a key role in the movie. But the first five minutes pass by and its the last you've seen of them. Then why the hell devote a poster and a trailer to it? I was extremely disappointed with this movie. It deserves a one, the lowest rating possible. Not because it doesnt have anything good about it, but for the way things are handled in the end.

The elements for a great movie are all there, they simply fail to have a sequence or to flow in a coherent manner and at times it goes way beyond unbelievable, I did end up thinking that Independence day was more believable than many parts of this movie.

1597,peterstac,A slow pace eventually going ... nowhere,5,16 August 2002,"There are many similarities between Shyamalan's movies - slow pace, building tension gradually and a climactic ending.  It worked in 'The Sixth Sense' and to a lesser degree in 'Unbreakable.'  Unfortunately in 'Signs' we're only left with the slow pace.Without giving much away (there isn't much to give), most of the movie deals with the issue of unknown aliens.  We aren't given many details, but this is used effectively to build suspense for the first half of the movie.  Then we're give a few more details that are so absurd as to cause you to suspend belief.  Once that happens, the suspense dissipates and all you're left with is a feeling of how much longer you'll have to endure to get to the inevitable twist.  When you do get to the end you'll wonder why you waited at all.If you liked 'The Sixth Sense' and were hoping for something similar, check out 'The Others.'",Signs
1598,Keith25,"A Fine Film, but probably not what you expect.",8,2 August 2002,"Alright, so it's not the film that they showed in the trailers, but that doesn't mean its not a fine movie.****** Possible Spoilers *****The alien invasion/crop circle plot is really just a backdrop to a storyline of the test of a man's faith.  The loss of Mel Gibson's wife made him lose his faith, and the saving of his son got it back.  He realizes that he is one of the first group of people and that there are no coincidences.Sure, the alien effects at the end are a little goofy, but that's OK as this is not the focus of the film.  If it was, we'd have seen Mel's basement loaded up with firearms and he and Joaquin would have kicked down the door and started kickin' some alien butt.  Instead, we see a man's struggle with loss and the effect it has on his family.I think the roles are perfectly cast.  Mel shows great range, Joaquin Phoenix is WONDERFUL (and actually steals the film IMHO), Rory Culkin shows that there IS some talent in that family and Abigail Breslin is just plain adorable.Night does another great job with tying up everything at the end and manages to give you another surprise ending, albeit not nearly as surprising as The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.  I can't wait for his next film",Signs

1600,sanyok,What signs?,5,21 August 2002,"SPOILER!! They may as well call this movie ""Father Graham Hess' discovery of inner self"".   Shyamalan must have missed the point of the script.

Subtract the ""signs"" and the aliens from the plot and you almost get a good drama.Mel's  and  Joaquin's acting was superb though.  The film had its moments and some potential but  Shyamalan lost it 30 minutes into the movie.  All the negatives aside I did enjoy the last scene where Merrill gets to kill the alien by spraying it water.Ah, on the point...  Why would creatures from other planet with super technologies to travel great distances and make themselves invisible, run around ""naked"" when their skin is sensitive to the most abundant  material on the planet they came to invade??  And what's the deal with them unable to break through pantry doors?  Doesn't sound like super race to me.Aliens were certainly underdeveloped by the script writers. Discounting the phone ringing and the door banging, the sound effects were absent from the movie full stop.Very disappointing film.",Signs
1601,steeashford,It takes the word 'terrifying' to a whole new level.,10,25 May 2010,"*INCLUDES SPOILERS*It was a dark evening in 2002, I was 12 years old and wasn't expecting a great deal of horror, seeing as it was rated a very lousy 12 certificate by the BBFC.I inserted the VHS tape, found a comfortable position on the couch and started to watch. Never before in my life had I been so immensely terrified by a movie. I took a peek at my mother who was sat next to me during the scene in the basement; her face explained what I was feeling. M. Night's ability to create so much chilling, hair-raising tension is monumental. The music is something I had never heard before, it's such an incredible contribution to the theme and mood of the film and defiantly in my opinion, a soundtrack deserving of an academy award. The story sees a family of four in rural Pennsylvania facing their greatest fears. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former reverend, is deeply saddened after the death of his wife in a road traffic accident. His brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) has moved in to help him get back on his feet and return to normal life. Graham's children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) have also been enduring deeply depressing times after the loss of their mother and have both lost faith in their father as it seems he has lost his. Many surreal events begin to occur, initially ignored by the family as they try to recover from their bereavement. As the events begin to snowball into a worldwide panic the family are forced to act, uniting and attempting to survive.The most terrifying part for me was the Brazilian home video scene. As the reporter informs the audience that ""What you're about to see may disturb you"" and the music begins, you can feel the suspense building. You're watching the video for around 40 seconds and nothing is happening, until the music builds to a climax and all is revealed. Phoenix's acting right here was fantastic, as he witnesses the video the immediate shock he shows is out of this world. This is the moment when he realises what to expect.The acting is superb, it really is. Gibson leads well and acts just as man would in his character's situation. He shows very low charisma, but still a doting side for his family. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was also a joy to watch especially during the Brazilian video scene, along with Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin who both contribute greatly.M. Night Shyamalan's screenplay writing for this film is very smart indeed; he is able to make a film feel so chilling, it's possible to feel your heart jumping from your chest. Even whilst watching the opening titles you can sense that you're in for a roller-coaster of a ride.The core subject of this movie is faith. How Graham had questioned his after his wife's death, how his children are losing theirs in their father, and how Merrill has lost his in himself.For me, this has everything; great acting, astounding suspense, recognisable characters and of course, aliens!

1607,jpaul_preston,OVER-RATED!!! OVER-RATED!!!,2,6 February 2004,"10 things I hate about Signs: **SPOILERS**1. Shameless Hitchcockian/Psycho opening music and credits rip-off.
2. Casting: Hiring 46-year-old Mel Gibson and 28-year-old Joaquin Phoenix to play brothers.3. Acting: Everyone said their lines like they were reading them off a teleprompter. Mel Gibson never changed his facial expression once during the entire film.3a. Small thing: If you want to build mystery about a character, don't cast the director of the film as that character. The audience will forget immediately that he is supposed to be mysterious and instead will say, 'Hey, that's the director!'4. Crop Circles are not inherently scary. You can't just establish that crop circles are scary without establishing why they're scary. The film opens with Mel Gibson discovering a crop circle in his yard. He is instantly frightened for the safety of his family, which is practically laughable. If some farmer woke up to find his crops ruined, I don't think he would be frightened. He would probably go and get his shotgun an' hunt down the sum' bitch who did it.4a. When one of the characters writes off the crop circles by saying it was discovered to be a hoax by some of British guys a few years back, you instantly negate your entire movie. Unless M. Nught purposely wants us to believe that two random dorks coincidentally guessed an alien language while playing their practical joke.5. Not one but TWO painfully long speeches by Mel describing how his children were born.6. Tired ""My child has asthma"" plot device, AND tired ""little kid happens to be standing next to the only opening in a locked room while monsters are trying to attack them, so one of them can reach in and grab him"" plot device, BACK TO BACK!7. Joaquin Phoenix plays an ex-baseball player who couldn't make it to the pros because he struck out a lot, even though he could hit the ball over 500 feet!!!  Um, probably not.8. When a kid thinks there's a monster standing outside their window, they don't tell their parents in a monotone voice. It's usually more of a blood-curdling scream.9. Hearing a jarbled cell phone conversation over a baby monitor and thinking it's two aliens talking.not scary.10. Retarded scene with alien walking through kid's birthday party. Why would the aliens jeopardize their entire mission so one of them could walk through a crowded birthday party in the middle of the day? Is he a big fan of cake? Did he want a crack at the piñata?Bonus #11 (big spoiler)11. The aliens' weakness is.(drum roll).WATER! It's like acid. It burns their skin. Sound clever? The answer is no, and let me tell you why. If the aliens are killed by water, how is it that they can walk around on Earth? The air on earth HAS WATER IN IT!!! It's what makes the sky blue. We measure it with something called HUMIDITY!!! Why would aliens come to a planet comprised mostly of water to harvest humans who are ninety percent water? It's a plot hole so big, you could fit Rosie O'Donnell through it.

I think his plot twists deceive the audience without adequate explanation or consistency. And now every movie has to have a trendy twist, most of them I either figure out before it happens or am disgusted when it is finally unveiled.I agree with most of people's complaints about the plot holes in Signs, specifically how unintelligent the aliens are. But my biggest problem with this movie is how lamely the 'faith' premise was interjected. Aliens meet God. Yikes. This might be my heretical agnosticism speaking here, but doesn't the concept of Alien life sort of suggest that there is no God? Okay so there are Aliens and God? Well I only have one question then.Do the aliens have their own God or is He the same as ours?",Signs

The acting was great, except Shy... himself, is like a piece of wood talking, he must stay behind the cameras, his work there is perfect. The story is amazing. The extraterrestrial attack is only a excuse, the faith in something bigger which is taking care of us is the principal topic. We never see during the film any spaceship, thats great, I'm a little tyred of special effects. Probably they shouldn't show us the alien, but it was necessary to close the perfect circle.",Signs
1611,Kirkless,Signs of Things to Come,9,2 August 2002,"There was a point near the beginning of ""Signs"" when I thought to myself, ""I have no idea where this movie is going to end up...I'm leaving myself in the hands of the director.""  Within the first few minutes of the movie I found myself engrossed in what was taking place.  The strange happenings begin taking place right from the beginning and each event makes you wonder what will happen next right up until the end.As far as the acting goes, Gibson and Phoenix both turned in great performances in their roles as a doubtful preacher and former minor league baseball star.  It was hard to believe that this same Phoenix played such a completely different role as the emperor Commodus in ""Gladiator"".  The two children were also very believable.As for the story-line, Shyamalan really shines here in developing his characters along with the progression of the story.  The more events that take place, the deeper you see into emotions and motivations of the Hess family.  As much as it may seem like a movie about crop circles or aliens, it is a movie about people finding their place and discovering the importance of who they are.  This is a theme that has run through all of Shyamalan's movies.  Unfortunately, in our society that breeds sequels for a public that desires to see clones, many would be happy just to see Shyamalan write and direct The Sixth Sense Part 2 and get it over with.  Signs is a different tale from either of his other movies and still clearly delivers his message.  If one can understand that Shyamalan was trying to get something across about people instead of setting the audience up for a shocking ending, then maybe all of his movies could be enjoyed even more. The ending to ""Signs"" wrapped everything up nicely which was the only thing I had predicted from Shyamalan.  I look forward to seeing what he does next.",Signs

You might think it unfair to compare his films this way, citing the fact that they are all about very different subjects, but I think they're going to be compared this way until Shyamalan matures as a screenwriter, and does something new.  All three of his films have used a very similar formula so far, the most important element being the shocking revelation at the end.  I think he really needs to stop relying so heavily on this element, because his revelations are becoming much less shocking with each successive film.  There's just no way he's going to top 'Sense', and I really think he should just stop trying, and move on.Just something else I noticed, it seems to that Shyamalan really wants to act, his cameos just keep getting bigger in each of his films.",Signs
1615,TayngoMaureen,A pleasant surprise,10,4 August 2002,"Granted the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect from this film--but upon seeing it, I will say that every negative review was blown out of the water.However, I am of the opinion that the simultaneous gasps (and one scream, might I add) coming from around the theatre was worth the price of admission in and of itself.With a suspenseful score appropriate for any thriller, I was hooked by the time the opening credits were finished--and it didn't end there. I was given no time whatsoever between the fade of the last words and the first striking image before the horror began.I was extremely impressed with all of the performances, but particularly with the emotional range of Rory Culkin (Morgan) and Abagail Breslin (Bo), and also by the comic timing of Joaquin Phoenix (Merrill)--something new for him, as he rarely gets a chance to flex his comedic muscles in the other films he has done. It is rare to see such talent all in one movie--and Mel Gibson (Graham) is stellar, as always, with his emotional portrayal of the reverend who has lost his faith.The overall humor of the movie, in fact, is absolutely sparkling, with witty one-liners and visual gags that will have you laughing for hours afterward. (And may I say, I think I'll make my own tinfoil hat.)My opinion? This film is a force to be reckoned with. Impressive soundtrack, impressive camera shots, impressive acting, and pretty impressive storyline. I've not been scared so badly in a long while--10/10.",Signs
1616,osoor,Awesome Movie!,10,23 July 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan struck gold with this movie. A movie that will certainly be around for a while and never forgot about. A movie that has all of the genres of a good movie: drama, thriller, horror, suspense, a little hint of comic relief, and many other. Everyone did such a wonderful job on this movie crew and definitely cast. Mel Gibson as Gramb Hess and Joaquin Phoenix as Gramb's younger brother. Even the kids did really well Rory Culkin as Morgan and Abigail Breslin as Bo. I so do recommend this movie to every one who wants to see a good movie like they haven't in a while then this one.GO SEE IT!!!",Signs
1617,Chewy_Penguin,My thoughts,9,5 August 2002,"I just got back from seeing this so here are my thoughts...All in all I would have to say I enjoyed this movie, however the end did kind of leave me disappointed, I was expecting something a bit better. All the praise that critics have given this movie is well deserved, the whole movie basically leaves you riving in anticipation for 'what will happen next?', which is why I think the ending was kind of sketchy, it is like going up steps the whole movie, its good, then better, then really amazing, and then it ends, and when it ends, its like you just fell a few stories because the next step is so low, also, I believe that this isn't a movie you can watch again and again to understand everything, I usually love these movies, namely 'Fight Club', when everything is happening at the end, you can just say, ""Okay, now I see"", rather than, ""what the hell does this mean?"".The other thing I didn't like was seeing the alien, seeing the hands was nice, and even the quick video capture, but I would have rather just seen shadows or tinted reflections.If you are looking to see a movie, then I would recommend this, I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because I am quite lenient on how I grade movies, but it does deserve a good rating and a good watch.Enjoy the show...",Signs
1618,cptnpanaka,Disappointed,4,15 August 2002,"I was really hyped up during the movie.  It kept building really well, and Phoenix and Gibson were awesome as always.  But then, when you are expecting something really cool to happen, the movie kind of dies out and the credits roll.  The movie is kinda twisted around this weird plot of Gibson being a former Reverend and his loss of faith.  How strange is that for a ""scary/thrilling"" movie?  Also, you would expect some really cool effects; but aside from crop circles that a 5 year old could make on a computer and an alien that looks like a human in a colored jumpsuit that clicks to make its ""sounds"", there is no special effects.",Signs

1620,dgackey,Shyamalan's most character-driven film to date,8,30 July 2002,"*** SPOILER FREE REVIEW ***Just saw ""Signs"" via a free sneak-preview.   In my opinion it was Shyamalan's most character-driven film yet, and was also far more humorous than either The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.  While this made the film really enjoyable in one aspect, it also distracted me because I expected the same kind of tone and execution he utilized in previous films.  That said, I still consider this movie to be worth the price of admission.  I rate it about 7.5/10.  It didn't excite me like his past two films did, but it was still better than most of the tepid summer fare.Thumbs up to whomever cast Joaqim Phoenix, he stole more than a few scenes in this one, and Mel Gibson proves once again that he's got a range few in his field can match.I really appreciate Shyamalan's willingness to explore imaginative and fun (but potentially disastrous) subjects like superheroes and crop circles, and I'm always intrigued by his ability to narrowly avoid falling into utter schlock.  This film dances on the edge a little more than his previous two, but in many ways it succeeds in ways the others failed, namely by providing character depth and humorous interludes that break up some of the overly grave tones he's prone to.Taken on its own merits, I think the film is a worthy one, and it certainly entertained me.  Unfortunately, many people expect every film the man makes to be a refilming of ""The Sixth Sense"", and the studios don't help matters with the ill-advised commercial themes which don't really give you a true sense of the kind of movie you're going to see.  As with Unbreakable, my advice is to go into this film with no expectations, and you will probably enjoy yourself.",Signs
1621,slashum,Yawn,2,31 July 2002,"After Sixth Sense, I was hoping for much more than this from M. Night. Mel Gibson is usually reliable, but he let me down as well.
Don't waste your money going to see this.  It felt like a short story that was dragged out as much as possible, and filmed by high school students.The budget for this thing was most likely on par with Blair Witch project, and as the other person here commented, it felt like Blair Witch at times. Anyone out there could have filmed this thing with a rubber alien hand and a video camera.After watching this, you feel completely hollow inside.  Don't be fooled, it's crap.",Signs
1622,Soonertown03,"Awesome, scary movie!",9,31 July 2002,"I absolutely loved this movie!    It is full of suspense and surprises and kept me on the edge of my seat until the credits rolled.   The brief glimpes of ""something"" kept me wondering what was around the next corner.  **The less you know about this movie going in the better.**This movie is nothing like Independance Day where the aliens are killing everything in sight.    The snippits of information we do receive about the crop circles and the possibility of aliens are thru brief news clips on TV and rumors from town folk.   Exactly like it would be if you were home alone.   That kept the fear of the unknown that much higher.    Not knowing what you are up against is often scarier than anything.I was also surprised how funny this movie was.    The mixture of suspense and humor made it all the more fun to watch.    The music was superb as well.Lastly, my only complaint of the movie was a distracting dialogue (during an extremely suspenseful scene) and the inability of the characters to stock up on weapons of some sort.    This did not hurt my opinion of the movie much though.I give this movie a 9 out of 10 and declare it my favorite movie of the summer.",Signs

I found my self glued to the movie screen, I mean this is actually a movie that is worth the $7.50 movie ticket. Mel Gibson's performance is just excellent. You never see Mel is a bad film. Well,maybe Lethal Weapon 4,but anyways. If you want to see a good suspense film, this would be the good choice. It will keep you shocked and suprised at every corner. It has to be with of the years finest.",Signs
1624,gzilliox,"Shayamalan's best picture yet, I left the theater uplifted.",10,9 August 2002,"It sounds stupid to say I left a science fiction movie uplifted, but the movie isn't really about alien invasions at all. It's about Faith, a base belief in human beings that life can be better than it is, hope for the future and acceptance of the past and present.  A belief that there is a reason for things to happen the way they do.I keep reading reviews saying the ending of the movie left people hanging. I think they are missing what M Night was trying to do with this film. The movie doesn't answer alot of questions about the aliens, and I think this is why people say the ending is abrupt. I don't think the movie is about the aliens at all.  It's about what happens when a man who claims to have lost his faith has just that put to the test.  Mel Gibsons character is meant to provoke something in all of us.  His character is designed by M Night to hold a mirror up to our lives, and reaffirm that good things can happen and that maybe things do happen for the best.  I think he wrote this movie to give people hope.Shayamalan used the Aliens (in brilliantly chilling fashion to test the Faith of his character in the movie.  Obviously, a scary alien invasion will test a man's character. Shayamalan found a great way to put his character to the test, a really frightening one, and a topic that keeps you interested. He could have told the same story with no aliens in it, it just would have been billed as a drama and less people would go to see it.  He used scary aliens to sugar coat a story that many viewers wouldn't see otherwise, a really smart move, and a great result for us!My guess is he (M Night) wants people to identify with mel Gibson and make that emotional journey with him as the movie progresses.  Do things happen for a reason?  Is there and grand scheme of things?  Does life have a point or purpose?  These are the topics Shayamalan was focusing on when he wrote the script, and I think that his hope was just to get people thinking about what they believe.  What the director believes is pretty obvious by the end of the film but I won't ruin the ending for those who haven't seen it. The point is, this movie will move you emotionally, and scare you to death at the same time, and I can't think of any other movie that can say that. What a ride, absolutely fantastic filmaking!",Signs
1625,mbushmire3,Thought-provoking!,10,11 August 2002,"This was a very thought-provoking movie about how an alien invasion of our planet affects one family, and whether or not we believe in a ""supreme being"" of some sort guiding our decisions.In a way, this movie is a lot like Independence Day, but without all the awesome special effects.  Instead, we are made to care about the Hess family:  Mel Gibson, as the preacher who has lost his faith after his wife's accidental death;  Joaquin Phoenix, as his brother, who's a minor-league baseball player who never made it big; and Rory Culkin (looking very much like his older brother, Macauley) and Amanda Breslin, as his children, who are both still hurting from their mother's death.There are some funny moments in this film - was I the only one who thought that Tracy's confession was hysterical? - to offset the more intense moments.  I don't think that any of it was too much for a child to handle, though, so I thought it kid-friendly.
The basic concept of the movie, though, is about faith.  After September 11, 2001, I believe that a lot of Americans worried about the ""end of the world,"" so to speak.  We didn't know what to expect from moment-to-moment, just as the Hess family doesn't know what to expect in this film.  Do you believe in ""God"" (in whatever form you accept), and do you think that everything happens for a reason, or do you believe that things just happen randomly, for no particular reason? I found these ideas genuinely thought-provoking, and that's why I think that this film was a very quietly powerful one.",Signs

1627,kevingrogg,"Deliberately paced, so what? Go see it",8,13 August 2002,"This movie was great, I saw it two days ago and I still feel a little creepy. Not many films can do that for me. I love that Shyamalan's films don't jump right out and grab you, no, they require a level of mental engagement and then they slowly crawl under your skin and work their way into your brain. You might not like the deliberate pace of his films, I don't mind it, but if you like well developed characters, well executed ideas and movies that stay with you for days, I highly recommend it.",Signs
1628,randomm,"""I hear Aliens""",6,2 August 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan borrows from many sources (even from himself) for this film, whether in the spirit of repackaging and recycling the themes and elements or as an homage to the shoulders he stands upon. And it almost works - if he can only pull everything together at the end so that he takes everything one step beyond or gives us a new perspective that we haven't seen or thought about before. Unfortunately, he doesn't. There's plenty of heavy cloud - and thunder and lightning and atmosphere - but no rain. And don't forget the herrings, ""red"" (a la Sixth Sense)  and otherwise.Despite its soft spots - thin plot, ending that doesn't deliver - the film has its strong points, namely excellent fx and suspense, strong acting (especially from kids) despite some  irrational rationale and a few lines that are just plain silly and/or irrelevant. In other words, if you want plot or otherwise totally satisfying movie experience, look elsewhere. If just watching Mel or titillating suspense does it for you, watch on!****** SPOILER ALERT *******This film tries to bank on its believability and asks that we suspend our disbelief. But honestly, if you come across an old baby monitor that is making noise, would you think that the main unit is on in the nursery (or a closet) or that the signal must be coming from unseen UFO's (do you hear aliens, ""...2 of them, talking together"")? This concept/scene belongs in that other movie - Sixth Sense. And how about those crop circles - if you suspected that strange circles in your field might be landing instructions for a hostile invasion, wouldn't you consider firing up the combine, the field or otherwise erasing the signs? How about irrigating those suckers? But then we'd miss Mel Gibson as a tortured and ineffectual soul (snap out of it, Mel! You're the Dad! Grab the kids and head to the lake like Night suggested! This is no time to be democratic!). And a priest who loses faith when faced with personal tragedy probably IS in the wrong profession - not that farming is a suitable alternative (probably requires more faith than the cloth).
Shyamalan's films are also enjoyable from the point of view of recognizing and assembling the clues woven into the scenes as well as whatever is going on in the film. A reason to watch this again would be to examine the clues that Shyamalan scatters along the way - like the color ""red"" and coldness as being symbolic of significant events/objects and presaging dead people, respectively. in The Sixth Sense. Though the reds were more muted in this, they still seemed to figure prominently. Also, I think the windchime sounds were strategically placed. Obviously, Bo's water obsession and Shyamalan's outright statement about water were significant. Another thing I'd look at is the use os light/dark, day/night.   I suspect these effects are more carefully plotted than the rest of this movie, but maybe a re-viewing (when it comes out on video) will show something I'm missing. I hope so.",Signs
1629,jacobs2k,"Rewarding film, suffers from misdirected marketing",10,2 August 2002,"This film is a suspense-drama about faith, family and personal philosophy. Let me repeat that. This film is a suspense-drama.The greatest difficulty that many will have with ""Signs"" is their own expectations for a science fiction story or simple action move. Those who expect an ""Independence Day"" or ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" will be disappointed. And they will lose out on a wonderful movie.""Signs"" is tightly focused on the Gibson's character. The heart of the movie revolves around how he chooses to view life. M. Night Shyamalan's direction is steady with a deep appreciation for and sympathy with the struggles of people struggling to lead and guide others. The tautly built sense of apprehension is structured around the mysterious and threatening events, but is more deeply focused on the internal confrontation of Gibson's character with himself and his own conception of the world.James Newton Howard's score transforms from an oddly sappy 50's style piece at the intro to a haunting, dissonant and simply disconcerting theme as the movie builds. It's a work of genius, not in the sense that you'll want to listen the soundtrack many times, but in the sense that it perfectly supports the film. Likewise the sound work richly provides a depth that captures well the unease within its commonplace setting. Shyamalan continues to pull great performances from children and both Rory Caulkin and Abibail Bensen are solid. They pull at your heart in believable ways and provide substance to the family.Bottom line:  Go for the thoughtful drama of human struggles with personal and family faith. Look elsewhere for the Sci-Fi and action kicks.",Signs

Especially note-worthy are the performances of all ACTORS including the Cameo of the director.But after three movies in the same genre , It would be interesting to see how Mr. Shyamalan approaches a non ghostly-sci-fi human drama.After seeing many summer movies,  I can attest that SIGNS gives the best bang for your Buck.",Signs

IT IS SOOOO F'IN SCARY!!!!!!****MAJOR SPOILERS****Seriously, last night, i had to leave my closet light on because I was so scared. Everywhere I looked, I saw that stupid alien on the roof!!!! AHHHH!!!! And the alien walking across the alley (okay i KNEW that that was going to happen, but when that thing popped out i was so F'IN SCARED!!!) and the alien reflected in the TV.  I think i almost peed my pants. I didn't know what to expect at that point, and when he rolled out the TV and there was the alien, squatting down in defense mode, and then the reflection of Joaquin walking into the room and dropping the insulin thingsOkay, calming down now. It was just such a good movie and some of the reviews here are like, it was horrible. How can you think that? I don't know, maybe it's more of a movie for the imaginative, but GOD was it SCARY!!!!Joaquin Phoenix gave one of his best performances, in my opinion, and Abigail Breslin (such a cutie!), shared a partnership with him as the two comic reliefs of the movie. Abigail was more cute than funny, although she did crack me up when she said ""Why can't they get boyfriends?"" and ""This is serious!"", but Joaquin's character was just, hilarious, and fearless. I noticed that he was the one that did everything, that boarded the walls, walked up the stairs when an alien could attack him at any time, stayed back to make sure the kids were okay, hitting a hostile alien in his room with a baseball bat, and even though they made him seem like a wuss at times, he was actually pretty damn brave. But God, was he funny. I especially enjoyed the scenes where he and Mel ran around the house (i was on the floor), when Mel came in and Joaquin had his tin foil hat on, and when he was packing the salt on against the cold shute and put a can up top.M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. An absolute genius. Naturally, audiences are expecting a surprise ending from the well-known writer/director who likes to twist his stories in horrifying ways, and that's exactly what he gives them.Right from the start, I leaned over to the person sitting next to me, and whispered ""Bo's the alien."" It was obvious, too obvious. The dog trying to kill her, the ""contaminated water"" obsession while the theory behind the aliens is that they don't like water, the dreams she has. M. Night made us believe that the big ""surprise ending"" was gonna be that Bo, or someone in the family, was an alien. Me, I thought it was Bo, definately, just because she's just too darn cute and she wasn't afraid of what was happening up until the end. But when M. Night actually gives us a HAPPY ENDING?!?! I was shocked, absolutely shocked, but laughing my arse off. It all made sense once it was explained, and it boggled my mind. The water, the asthma, the bat mounted on the wall. All of it just, scared me more than anything.I could go on about this movie forever, but I think I'd go step by step through the whole sequence of things, and I've already given enough spoilers, so I'll just end it saying M. Night's done it again. The movie's scary, the movie's funny, the movie's definately not overrated, and the movie's just one that you have to see TONIGHT!!!

1636,mahesh-moturu,Brilliant!!,10,3 August 2002,"**** SPOILER ALERT ***** **** SPOILERS ALL THE WAY *****For me, the movie Signs' deals with at least three more subjects - apart from the crop-circle mystery. The trailers tell us this movie is about the mystery of crop-circles and who did those. By the middle of the movie, we know it is Aliens who did it. So it becomes an Alien invasion movie from then onwards. In the end it reveals another subject  a preachers journey towards restoration of his faith.But, there is another subject that lies beneath all this. It is about exploring the role of myths and beliefs in us, and affirming their significance in of our lives. There are several myths and beliefs explored in this movie - including, belief in God, existence of Aliens, kids faith in parents as protectors, reason for the existence of flaws - especially in humans, premonition, purpose behind unexplainable events, purposes of individuals in this world.Belief 1: Some higher power guides and protects the faithful Graham's faith in God is shaken, and finally restored. His wife's death was a God's test and has a purpose. His brother's swinging away', his son's asthma, and his daughter's dislike for water, Ray's call, and even the threat from Aliens led to restoration of faith and revival of affectionate bonding with his family and fits neatly for him to have faith renewed.Belief 2: There is life on other planets and Aliens are coming. Morgan's belief in Aliens, and crop circles as signs for their navigation is affirmed beyond doubt. Skeptics (Graham and his brother) who did not believe him got convinced. Several beliefs about Aliens by various characters are explored, questioned, ridiculed and finally affirmed to be true: Aliens exist; they are planning to invade earth; they are using crop signs to navigate; their communication can be heard on radio signals; they don't like places near water. And so on Belief 3: Some flaws in people may not be what we think they are. Merrill's shaken faith in himself is regained after understanding the purpose of his flaw. Again, seemingly flawed characteristics of Morgan's Asthma and Bo's sudden aversion to water - all have some deeper meaning.Belief 4: Parents are always there to protect young children. This faith that was shaken in kids because of their mother's death and growing distance from their father, is finally restored and reaffirmed.Belief 5: Animals and kids have premonition of bad things. Bo was questioned for her sensing something in water but ultimately proved correct. Dogs were correct too.Belief 6: There is a purpose behind every event and tragedy. Death of Graham's wife, Ray hitting her, and many other events are explored for a deeper meaning.Belief 7: Every person has some purpose in life - obvious or not so obvious. By the end of the movie, each character gets something meaningful for them. Graham has not wasted his life in dedicating his life to something that he lost faith in. Merrill finds a purpose in swinging away'. Both kids got to know how precious they are for their mother (story of their birth) and father. Even Ray feels some purpose in why the accident happened, uses an opportunity to clear things with Graham, and plays a role in informing Graham about Alien's weaknesses.Every character brings it's own set of beliefs or myths which are explored, tested, and ultimately, all are affirmed to be true. The beliefs of some minor characters like the military person who believes in Alien invasion tactics, the bookstore owner who thinks crop-circle coverage as a scheme for advertising sodas are also affirmed at a trivial level by subsequent events. Even the pharmacy clerk has her beliefs about sinning affirmed by an authority she trusted.Am I reading too much into Signs'  more than what there is? May be. Even though I don't believe in most of the stuff he asks us to believe, my faith in Shyamalan in delivering a brilliantly complex movie, which was a bit shaken after reading some reviews, is finally restored and soared to a higher level. If all this is just my own myth, so be it.On top of this, Signs' defies genre - mystery, suspense, horror, sci-fi, drama, and comedy  all at the same time.",Signs

My boyfriend agreed not to try to scare me at moments of high tension or be subjected to viewing three romance movies of my choosing.  He behaved but was never truly tested because this movie didn't deliver on what was promoted in the trailers. Other than momentary startles, this invasion movie has only slightly more suspense than Bedknobs and Broomsticks!Spoilers below!!!This movie is first and foremost proof that you should never reveal too much about your methods if you intend to use them again.  The ""making of"" documentary about Sixth Sense let all the tricks out of the bag.  From the moment Mel Gibson sets down the water glasses and we see them strewn about the rest of the room, I knew they'd be key to the ending.  Also, I wonder if MNS ever saw Day of the Trifids?Mel Gibson as a shell shocked, slow moving, and at times slow-witted farmer didn't work for me, not because he wasn't at his best, but either the script or the editing removed almost all evidence of the character's ability to reason.  For instance, where was his call to his friend the police officer to let her know about the alien in the pantry or to give her the ""fingertips""?  Was it to save us from enduring more monotone delivery from her?  (And how did the alien get out of there in order to reappear later?)Are we really to believe there would be no reporters or hordes of the curious appearing in his corn fields?  The horror of protecting his farm, his family's privacy and his kids from strangers would have made a more frightening movie than this one!With one exception, the movie outcome was predictable from the get-go.  The brother states in the recruiting office that he has his prize baseball bat at home.  The only surprise at the end of this movie is the baseball bat being in his brother's living room instead of his own.  Shouldn't it have been in his apartment as he said?  He didn't take it with him to his brothers with his pillowcase full of belongings.  I was expecting that and looked for it.  (Also due to seeing that ""making of"" program.)  Besides, when would he have mounted it?Some things were great about this movie, it's just not the movie they advertised.  The last movie I saw that did this was The Abyss, which I will forever call The Abysmal because of it.  They should have had more faith in their movie and audience and promoted it for what it really was - a tale about faith and struggling back from devastating loss while facing the possibility of another.The acting of the family characters as a whole was great.  The kids were extraordinary and Joaquin Phoenix got a new fan.  The distraction of the Alfred Hitchcock-like appearance of the producer wasn't welcome but will probably end up as a good trivia question someday.Moral of the tale?  Don't brag too much when you do it right!  Not if you want to ever surprise your audience again!",Signs

It is this achievement that proves Shyamalan's mastery of his craft--he is able to juggle both tension and relief without sacrificing one for the other.-Possible Spoiler Warning-The plot itself is thick with mystery and skepticism. The characters wonder about the circumstances they find themselves in, the loyalty they have to each other, the faith they hold dear, and their ultimate fate. Every aspect of ""Signs"" is held up and analyzed, with the audience trying to piece the answers together with what little is revealed. The issue becomes the 'neatness' with which the answer is given: how could it have been that easy?However, one cannot truly criticize a film for the tale it tells so much as how it is told. It is for that reason that ""Signs"" is a film whose greatness isn't apparent until one wonders at what it did wrong. It was perfect. It was Shyamalan's vision come to life, and whether or not we agree with his creation, we cannot help but marvel at the process.***SPOILER WARNING***I do have one bone to pick: near the end of the movie, Mel Gibson's character moves the TV so his son can watch.

Gibson and Phoenix were quite excellent as a reverend wrestling with God, and his brother who wants him to go back to the way he was. There were many shades to these performances, and like the scary scenes, you knew there was more to everything than what you could actually see or hear.That's what makes it so amazing...there IS violence in the picture, but most of it is only talked about as happening elsewhere.

1647,captainhaddock,The best film of the year.,10,4 August 2002,"*very minor spoilers only*Usually I can accept that people have widely varying opinions of movies. However, I cannot understand anyone who does not consider this film one of the best ever.M. Night Shyamalan has shown us that he intends to be the best Hollywood director of the new century.  His 6th SENSE was terrific, and his UNBREAKABLE even better, but SIGNS is a tour de force.Shyamalan puts soul into SIGNS like few directors or writers can.  He's taken an event so colossal in importance that it could mean the end of the world, and he's turned it into a small, personal story; and in doing so, he makes the film's events of even greater importance to the audience.  I can be impressed by Will Smith shooting down aliens, or Agent Mulder gallivanting about the country hunting down the paranormal; but it never feels real and I'm never a part of it.SIGNS, on the other hand, is as real as it gets.  You're on the farmstead with the rest of the Hesses, peering into dark corners, catching glimpses of terrifying spectres on the television, and straining to hear every creak and rustle from outside.  No other director can make the story feel as relevent and as genuine as Shyamalan can.  Disbelief is not merely suspended, it is torn from your mind and hidden where you cannot find it.It's also scary.  In fact, it's the scariest movie I've ever seen.  Today's ubiquitous, gratuitous gore and overdone ""look-at-me"" CG monsters cannot replicate the genuine terror that lasts the entire movie.  One particular scene, shot on home video and broadcast on the Hesses' television, scores a 0 in the eye candy department but a 10 in the freaky department.
And on top of these base instincts, SIGNS piles on simple yet profound moments of sadness, happiness, and humour.This is not an alien movie, yet it is the mold on which alien flicks should be patterned; and it is more effective than any I have seen.  The slower moments bore only the moviegoer whose wits have been so dulled by slasher pics and moronic sitcoms that he cannot understand the unfolding psychological drama.  The at-first-confusing introduction of the veterinarian is a clever way of unfolding several key subplots.  The ending is not a disappointment if the viewer has any intelligence at all.  Rather, it turns Father Hess's inner conflict (and the movie's real storyline) on its head, resolving the entire film in an unexpected and greatly satisfying manner.  The drama is not cheesy; if anything, cheesiness is what happens when other filmmakers try to pull off what Shyamalan has done and fail.What else is there to say?  The acting is wonderful, the scripting perfect, the sound production incomparable.  The lighting and camera angles are not distracting, but they are done in such a way as to make the viewer just as confused, interested, scared, and engaged as the characters on-screen.  In short, this is a rare gem, and I cannot wait to see what Shyamalan has for us in the future.",Signs
1648,anthony-ippolito,"Heed not the fools, for this is filming greatness!",10,4 August 2002,"I saw M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" last night and I must say that I cannot understand the negative attention that this film is getting.  Yes, I have seen numerous good reviews for it, but also an inordinate amount of bad ones as well, and upon reading why some people didn't like it, it baffled me: the ending was ""not conclusive"" and ""there were some sappy scenes"" and, best of all, ""some scenes were borrowed from other films.""Well, I am not here to spoil any part of the film but I will address the main criticisms of this film, since I do not feel I have to explain in depth what worked in it, I will just list it: solid acting from Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, the two kids, the very serious military general and Cherry Jones who plays a sheriff; very good cinematography and camera angles; numerous humourous moments and even better scary moments, which for a PG-13 film really put to shame anything I've seen in allegedly scary R-rated films; excellent atmosphere of tension and anticipation; and perhaps most importantly, an emphasis on some serious questions concerning the nature and ordering of the universe.Having said what I liked, there was not much that I didn't.  The so-called ""sappy scenes"" (I guess some people can't understand why a father would talk affectionately to his kids moments before they might all die) were effective, as they revealed the way a real person might react in such a situation.  The so-called ""dull"" or ""inconclusive"" climax and ending, well, who said that movies should be so clean-cut and have a definitive ending? Such endings are for the simple-minded who desire their baby-food as opposed to a full course meal, generally speaking, and the fact that the film closes the way it does leads people to think about many things.  The same people who didn't like the ending in ""Signs"" are the same ones who thought the brilliant ending to ""Traffic"" was also bad.  Finally, about Shyamalan borrowing too much from other films, well, it does not change the fact that he is a brilliant writer-director who is capable of arranging scenes in an interesting, thoughtful manner, regardless of their origins.All in all, ""Signs"" is one of the best films you will see this year, and is another feather in the cap of M. Night Shyamalan.  Though the film has flaws (as does every film, without exception) they do not detract from the better parts.  The film's strengths outweight its weaknesses, perceived or otherwise.",Signs
1649,Gwythaint_ny,signs of spoilers,7,4 August 2002,"I have enjoyed all the work that M.Night Shayalaman has produced, but I have often wondered; how many original ideas can one person produce? The Sixth Sense was completely new; I loved Unbreakable but its impact was understated,but it also had an action hero cast as an action hero, but Signs was not quite the same.  The main thing that it had difficulty with was the dramatic casting of Mel Gibson in a movie almost completely free of action sequences as we have come to expect them from hollywood. Night created a film, that while dressed lightly in the trappings of science fiction, and definitely suspenseful, was an emotionally centered personal drama. On this level, it was very good, and its focus on the sensation of impending doom was much more satisfying than pleny of films that removed the threat from our imagination and slammed it on the screen head on instead. He made use of a lot of referential imagery.  Repeatedly, we would se Mel's character, the formerly Reverend Graham Hess being framed in a doorway with the shadow lines of an absent cross on one wall, signifying his loss of faith, and behind him, a stained glass window with an eye-of-God motif, which I suppose indicated the continuing presence of that which Hess was denying. With Gibson as the lead, it took a while to realize that this was a movie without any kind of action hero, unless you considered Joaquin Pheonix's cowering, insecure ball player.  Seriously, the anti-esp helmets made them look like hersey's kisses.spoilers(moreso)When they decided to board up the house against the monstrous menace, clawed, greenskinned and hungering to consume their flesh, the sequence was a direct lift from Romero's Night of the Living Dead, complete with a final retreat into the poorly secured basement.  As a fan of that film, I appreciated the reference, as a means of applying context to the level of fear.  Of course, the relative toughness of the foe was more severe, because a thump in the head was sufficient for the zombies, but it took the world's hardest batter about a dozen swings, enough to break the bat, and all the leftover's the precognitive little girl could gather about the house to do in the baddie.",Signs

The best part of the movie however was the wonderful acting. Mel Gibson was excellent as the former preacher who lost his faith.  He was very clever and made the character so realistic.  The best character however must have been, Pheonix, cast in the role of the younger brother, he was the comic relief in the movie.

1655,mr-gm,"Certainly overrated, but not all bad.",4,16 August 2002,"-- MILD SPOILERS --Reviews I've read of 'Signs' seem to either praise it up to the skies or lambast it as a complete waste of money. I'd say it was neither of those - simply a poor to average film.I enjoyed both 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable', but not 'Signs'. All the elements of the previous films were there - MNS' slow, deliberate pacing, excellent performances from the central actors and the building suspense. But I could not care about the paper-thin characters, and without that, the suspense was meaningless. Sure, I was curious as to what was going to happen, but I didn't *care*. For the most part, the handling of the religious overtones was hokey and heavy-handed. Again, the poor character development might have interfered with my appreciation of these aspects. The ending to the film was distinctly unsatisfying, and raised more questions than it resolved. Finally, the poor special effects (if so they can be called) and 'alien invasion' plot aspects were ridiculous enough to be distracting.That being said, there were several redeeming moments scattered throughout the film - some of genuine humour, some of genuine fear. Scattered as they were, these moments were all entertaining. I was fortunate enough to be able to observe the reactions of the woman seated next to me in the cinema to some of the more frightening scenes - that was worth my $14 all in itself. Luck or miracle?I've read elsewhere that the entire movie was a dream - that this was its 'genius'. If I were to ever give it another viewing, I might be persuaded that it was Bo's dream, but so what? It might explain the film's shortcomings, but it doesn't excuse them. I see a film to be entertained, and be it reality, fantasy, sci-fi or dream, I still want a quality story with characters I can make an emotional investment in.

As an avid fan of movies, and someone who watches reviews and award ceremonies very closely, I can honestly say this is the most entertaining movie ever made. The camera work forces you to follow every detail on the edge of your seat. The movie keeps you on edge from the first scene to the last. As a reviewer from the show Access Hollywood put it, if Alfred Hitchcock made a movie relating to extra terrestrials, this would be it. It is so intense that the viewer is eyes wide open during every scene. Mel Gibson gives a extremely compelling performance as a former reverend, and Joaquin Phoenix shows his versatility by playing a former baseball player who moves in with his older brother, Gibson, after a tragic accident. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are simply amazing. Their performances are heartfelt and cheery at the same time. Cherry Jones provides comfort as a realistic local law enforcement officer. One can only see Signs to understand its deep nature. But this movie is not about aliens, it is about a man finding himself. Everyone thought it was impossible that M. Night Shyamalan could top himself, but he has done it with Signs, a movie which is even more entertaining, compelling and deep than the Sixth Sense.

1658,theplanet,this movie is so disappointing... don't waste your time,4,5 August 2002,"I really adore Shyamalan for ""Sixth Sense"", but ""Signs"" is maybe the biggest disappointment of this movie season. And it's too bad, because the movie starts out so strong and the first 30 minutes are absolutely thrilling. However, the more time passes the more it appears that the movie doesn't have any story to tell. You are waiting for a ""big bang"" ending like in ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable""? Well, your patience won't be rewarded. The inevitable weakness of this movie is its over-constructed plot. Shyamalan is searching for the mysterious elements and explanations that made his former movies so famous - without success. I would love to discuss the final explanation for it all and its stupidity, but I would tell the ending and obviously shouldn't do that. But it appears to me - and I guess I can tell you that without telling you too much - that Shyamalan wants to tell us that ""God is the answer"" to it all... Is this really all the message? In the end this movie leaves the viewer alone and this is sad... All I can give you for now is an advise: Don't waste your money for this Hollywood crap!

After having greatly enjoyed 6th Sense and Unbreakable, I thought for sure that this would be an enticing piece. Unfortunately, this attempt at an alien & return to religion (I'm unsure) storyline just plain, for both, sucked. An alien invasion! Alien!! This family's realization of an alien presence on Earth was boring and not evident. Sure, w/ well-staged and well-planned (you're being force-fed Hollywood here!) catch-lines and actions (family wearing aluminum foil on heads, now isn't that funny), it was delivered only humorously. But, the alien invasion was also delivered confusingly or as immaterial. As examples of this: Would anyone in his right mind who was cognizant of the fact that an alien broke into his home & was just upstairs of where they are standing find this to be a suitable time to kneel down and convey an ~2 minute birthing story to his son? We are already aware by this time that the aliens are hostile! i.e., What the hell are you thinking?! The director's character asks for forgiveness or understanding from Mel Gibson's character regarding the horrible accident that ended Mel's wife's life BUT then decides to throw in only a brief mention that he locked one of the aliens in his bread pantry before quickly driving off so don't go in there. What kind of person who is asking for forgiveness or understanding would act this way? If you've got to leave quickly, what good is it to mention something like this to Mel. Why even say anything about it? But better yet, REALIZE that we're talking about an alien here and at least show some interest in it & stay to maybe investigate what to do about the alien in the pantry! After all, it's not a stray cat we're talking about here!! Yet that's what the director's character actions convey; that it's only a stray cat. Bloody awful...

1661,simon_p_oliver,Desperately slow to begin with and generally shockingly amateurish,2,5 August 2002,"Spoiler Alert So this is a Mell Gibson movie with a sci-fi twist. Budget should be no problem! Dialogue and screenplay should be what you've come to expect from a Mel movie right! Wrong! very wrong! This is one move that really sucks, more even than Reign Of Fire and that was fairly poor, though an enjoyable romp.!The movie's first half an hour is desperately slow moving and while it has its few tense moments they dissolve into farcical, amateur-dramatic, almost slap-stick conclusions that you somehow cannot believe were quite intentional. Accordingly, the fantasy of the movie is shattered and you are left squirming in your seat wondering how Mel Gibson could have allowed himself to be part of something quite so awful. And those are the memorable bits! My companion was soundly asleep by the time the movie was half way through and had to be awakened when things started to hot up.... eventually.I am not an out and out ""Action movie"" fan, far from it in fact. And I was certainly not under the illusion that I was going to see an action movie here. But the vignettes and cameos that are littered throughout this movie almost in the style of a French low-budget production simply fall far short of the mark, often adding nothing to the plot and giving the impression that the director was being totally self indulgent for no reason at all. All very shameful.The latter portion of the movie does at times manage to achieve a significant level of edge-of-the-seat suspense, but most often manages to loose it somewhere near the climax leaving the audience feeling somewhat cheated and let down. And the screening of an alien in the final few minutes of the movie is sadly reminiscent of an awful B-Movie, rubber-clad actors flapping cardboard fins around whilst trying to convince us they are hostile marine life from the bottom of the sea. Complete nonsense and a big let down.The movie deals with a hot-topic and one that could easily have engendered a spine crawling horror at the thought of the Earth being invaded by aliens bent on body snatching. And to be fair, from time to time this film does make the audience squirm in its seat with fear of the unseen invaders. But most often, it gets its jump scenes from sudden dog barks and views of door knobs being turned from the other side by the hand of the invader. For the same budget and using the same ideas, it could have all been too scary for words leaving a traumatized audience having nightmares for weeks and wondering who is really ""out there"" at night.

The movie is all about tension build up and despite the rather short end movie climax, I was immersed in the story that was being told. People in the movie act logically. If it were directed by some other directors, Mel Gibson would definitely be holding a shot gun blasting aliens, and the climax could be a hurt Mel Gibson and a bunch aliens crawling on the kitchen floor, reaching for the rifle with only one bullet left.I have stopped watching sequels of Halloween, Friday the 13th, Scream, etc for years, and this movie is a breath of fresh air in the horror/thriller movie genre.",Signs
1663,starringas,This is a film that has re-invented suspence. A Triumph!,10,5 August 2002,"As an independent film maker M. Night Shyamalan has raised the bar for excellence with Signs. He did it with a script that can only be described as a flawless piece of written art, his direction can only be put into words with 'genius', and the performances from the actors is nothing short than frightfully close to real. The profound use of symbolisms is a God-sent to those of us who ACTUALLY enjoy thinking, for those of us who go to the theatre to view a film, not just see a movie. In fact I say that the only way anyone can even begin to call this film anything short of amazing is by using the excuse that it's symbolisms and excellence flew directly over their heads. This film was never a sci-fi knock off of Alien or any other sci-fi movie, it is completely unique, and by all rights should be given it's own genre - my girl friend said it best by pointing out that Shyamalan put every single emotion into this film. It can grip you in a hundred ways and take you from emotion to emotion in a matter of a scene change.There is no comparing Shyamalan to Hitchcock or anyone else for that matter. While I'm sure Night looks at Hitchcock as master of suspense in no way is this a rip off of one of his films like other users had said. M. Night Shyamalan is the Renaissance Man of the film world, he flies well beyond ordinary standards of 'good'. With The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and now with Signs he has made three marks in history and will most likely never be over passed.And furthermore none of us have any right to judge his thoughts or visions, for they are his and when all of you users out there who write things like ""for shame"" and use words that are demeaning, I don't think any of you have a right to unless you have even come close to doing what he has.-My congradulations to M.

1668,leah_platt,A huge disappointment,4,7 August 2002,"I have been a dedicated fan of M. Night Shyamalan since happening upon ""The Sixth Sense"" a few weeks before the (well-deserved) hype hit.  I chalked up the flatness of his next venture, ""Unbreakable,"" to the jitters that inevitably come with the pressures of fame.But what is the excuse for ""Signs,"" which despite its solid acting and beautiful cinematography, relies on a storyline so banal that it leaves the viewer feeling used?  There are no surprises here.  Unlike Shyamalan's earlier movies, which depended on neat twist endings and that eerie ""Twilight Zone"" feeling you get when the world isn't at all what it seems, Signs is as straightforward as a Sunday school lesson.  And, I won't be ruining anything if I tell you that of course Father Hess (Gibson), in whose corn field the little green men land, finds his lost faith -- and just in the nick of time.Which leads me to one last question: does anyone else detect a hint of the evangelical ""Left Behind"" series here?",Signs
1669,cbhunter,Riveting and clever scarefest reinvents the modern horror film,9,6 August 2002,"I have been a horror film fan for 30 years.  While I remember a few films actually scaring me as a kid (Jaws, Psycho), I have failed to encounter many in my adult life.  I like to be scared, but Hollywood has seen fit to retread every tired formulaic convention in just about everything it throws at the local multiplex. Even the independent filmmakers, free of the ""system"", seem to forget what FEAR is. Mostly I sit solemnly staring in disbelief at the screen, waiting and hoping to get those goosebumps. Then, finally, we were given Signs. Most will say, including the director, that this is not a horror film;  I genuinely disagree.  If this is not a horror flick, then it is time for this film to start a branch of its own and begin a new genre.  I admired every little aspect of this picture, from the use of everyday objects: baby monitor, a blank television screen and a half empty glass of water, to convey and act as a vehicle to extract fear from the ordinary. Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the most out of space, actors and sound. It is the lingering shot on a basement staircase when you are desperately hoping he moves his camera to show us more, or the screeching sound in the next room  whose source he won't reveal .  This director knows just how long to hold the shot, to increase the tension and build the suspense, long enough for our mind to begin forming pictures.  And those pictures can be the most frightening of all.  Stay the course Shyamalan.",Signs

1671,nandinig,I thought this movie was terrible,2,7 August 2002,"I don't know where to begin with this movie. I saw it last night, and at the end my husband and I just burst out laughing right there in the movie theater. Maybe if it had not been so hyped I would have been less offended, but really what are people thinking comparing the directing to Hitchcock and Speilberg? I am less surprised by how bad the movie is, and more by people's reactions to it, which I find absolutely flabbergasting.***SPOILERS ALL THE WAY!**** The story, such as it is, has been summarized in other reviews so I will deal with its meager elements. I'm not sure whether these are spoilers because frankly I did not find anything suspenseful in the entire movie. But if you have made up your mind to see it anyway then you should avoid reading this paragraph. Mel Gibson stars as a wooden faced ex-priest who everyone still calls father but who has apparently given up his priesthood because his wife died in a car accident. First of all not much of a priest to put one's faith in - I mean what did he tell his parishioners who experienced tragedy - better you than me? Anyway take the director's word for it - the man has lost his faith in God. And the movie is about how he regains that faith in one revelating moment (the last 2 mins). That's it. Even if one is remotely interested in how an individual misplaces or regains ""faith"" this movie would not satisfy- there is no gradual questioning or development, there is no subtlety anywhere to be found. This is not one man's ""journey"" - there is no trip, the guy is standing in the same spot and stuff falls out of the sky onto his head. Faith is regained in an aha moment, just like it was apparently lost in one. Even though I'm not a remotely religious person (and this premise bores me silly) I can still see how insulting it is to pitch faith as an object one can lose in an instant. What about the fact that this guy does not believe, respect,or get any joy out of his son, brother or daughter? To me he looked like he needed to take some Prozac.
Ok now for the mistreated aliens in the movie. People have billed the alien invasion as being scary. I wonder what movies these people have been watching? Hokey - yes, cheesy - yes, scary - no. Compare this to the Blair Witch Project ( a far far superior movie so I don't really want to suggest that they are comparable), and what you have is Everybody Loves Raymond. There are precisely 3 BOO! moments that you are fully expecting and that are very shabby. Getting into the specifics, these aliens are technologically advanced enough to come all the way across the universe - yet they have not figured out that water can kill them? What happens when it rains?! The planet is 3/4 water for chrissakes! The alien part was so schlocky that all I can assume is that the director meant it to be that way. Why so lame? It was a way to get people into the movie theater - which has worked. When people attribute a subtler motive, i.e. the alien stuff is to distract you etc, that does not work because without the aliens the guy could not regain his faith - the big message. Contrary to what is being put forth, the alien part is crucial - i.e. no aliens - no plot. Then why was it done so badly? Because he could not figure out a way to do it well. If you want to see a real spoof of aliens see Mars Attacks. Signs is not a nod to bad B movies of aliens attacking earth - this is the genuine article.Now to the characters. There are 4 in the family and one policewoman. The two kids and the policewoman are all developed early and then they disappear. Why? I don't know. The kids don't literally disappear (the police does even though aliens are attacking)- but they don't have any roles once the aliens attack. Boy is laid low with asthma, girl stands around. At the beginning the boy is given a rather proactive role, he hears sounds on the baby monitor, checks a book out of the library and teaches his dad and uncle everything there is to know about aliens, makes tin hats for everyone to protect their thoughts. Then once the attack happens - kaput. Nothing, he's got no plan, no ideas, no role. The boy killed the beloved family dog with an axe to protect his sister in the first scene, and then when the aliens attack, all he;s asked to do is pass out. I think the director was too distracted trying to get Mel Gibson to develop a second expression for his face. Apparently the whole point of having that character in the movie is that he had asthma. Then all the stuff at the beginning was just to keep the actor busy cos it has no significance whatsoever for the movie. Same for the policewoman, just disappears in the second half of the film when these people are under attack! Perhaps the local law enforcement agency needs more funding. Then you have the director himself in an incredibly stupid vignette - a long winded melodramatic speech asking for forgiveness and then he revs up the car and drives off at high speed while Mel Gibson is still holding on to the side of the car. You'd think that if you ran over someone you would watch your wheels around remaining members of their family. The brother. The brother is a jock, albeit a somewhat unsuccessful one. Is that relevant for the movie? No. This jock does not even think of bringing a weapon with him down to the basement where they go to hide from the aliens.  So let's get this straight, somewhere in rural pennsylvania in the middle of cornfields, in a farmhouse, there are no weapons? I don;t mean AK-47s - no get this, as aliens are trying to break down the windows and doors, two able bodied men take two young children down to the basement, and they don't even have a kitchen knife with them! The jock even has to be directed to a baseball bat to smite one of the evil ones - otherwise he would just keep standing there with his mouth slightly agape while a slimy creature digs its long unpainted nails into his nephew's face.Of course the jock can;t reach for the baseball bat himself because faithless guy has to remember dead wife's last words and direct him to pick up the bat. All part of the subtle plot.I will stop now, reliving this film has been painful. But I have to add one last note - thank god for the last scene - that kept us laughing all the way home.",Signs

But as far as being considered a good movie, I would rank this movie with 'Hollow Man'.  I guess that was kind of mean.  Anyone see the trailer or the previews for this movie and think it had something to do with aliens?  I sure did.  I thought this movie was about aliens invading the Earth and the warnings they were leaving us through crop circles that appeared years before, hence the name 'Signs'.  Little did I know that this would end up being a feel good movie of restoring your faith into God through the help of signs.  Not only did the writer foreshadow this story to death, the plot had potential to thicken in so many ways but still managed to leave the audience with nothing. You'd think that intelligent life with technology that advanced would think of attacking the human race with something more harmful than gas not to mention the lack of research the aliens did on a planet that is 75%(?) water, when water ended up wiping most of them out and driving them away from Earth.The only thing that I will take with me from this movie is that 'there are two types of people in this world', but even that wasn't too profound.

1675,geeklazy,Signs of Spielberg - Is Your Sixth Sense Unbreakable ?,7,9 August 2002,"It was a moment of joy for me. For an indian like me to witness a loud applause from the audience for a hollywood movie in an american theatre directed by an indian. And it was truly breathtaking. Yes, Manoj Night Shyamalan does it again. First by sixth sense he swept us near the oscars then he dusted the childhood heroes inside us through his unbreakable . Now he comes back to touch the spiritual and human side of us with a backdrop of UFOs in his signs.
Signs is a movie to relish quietly in a corner of the theatre without catcalls and whispers. It really impacts you with a melodramatic and an eerie mood. Make you rethink your beliefs. Only condition - Listen to the dialogues carefully, else you might be lost in this complex screenplay.
Shyamalan love for philadelphia, where he was brought up is evident and this one is set there too. The greenish farm which is the heart of the movie increases the suspense. Amazing location.
This movie is ceratinly Mel gibson's career high. Shyamalan's builds Mel Gibson's character slowly yet strongly. He is such a cool actor that his character builds up in you. Thats what he did to me in ' What Women Want' . You become him after some point of time in signs and you get involved in the during the course of the movie and try to save you and your children from the UFOs and aliens.
The twist which you would expect in shyamalan's movie is certainly missing but that is the wish of a creative writer which cannot be questioned. To the given story and characters, shyamalan gives rationale and ends it great. Some might think that it was an abrupt ending but that again depends on your taste of movies. Night doesn't spoon feed you. Just makes you realize the need of using your brain and co-relate events. Thats why you so feel special while you see such movies. You feel elevated to the heights of thinking and you certainly do. Your sixth sense would not be unbreakable and you suddenly rise up from your seats in fear. Especially in a scene while the dog which is silently eating and suddenly barks the nerve out of you.A Spielberg is on the making and we are witnessing one of the to-be-legends of all time. Is that so? Your catch on this is welcome.",Signs

All you will be thinking of is the things in this movie, and that is a good thing.Parents, unless your kids can stand some pretty scary elements in a movie, I suggest you do not take them to see this, or they will be sleeping in your bed tonight.",Signs
1677,Priyesh_ptl,Signs ain't just another sci-fi movie,8,22 March 2008,"I just watched signs on DVD, and found the movie to be highly enjoyable. I loved Shyamalan's cinematography style which certainly pays homage to the great Hitchcock. Shyamalan's ability to stir up emotions from so little on screen is incredible taking you form laugh out loud comedic moments to edge of your seat fear. This is the sort of movie I'd watch when I want something different from the standard Hollywood fare of big budget CG and over the top acting.Before I watched this movie I already knew about the aliens weakness against water and I do admit it does make you scratch your head as to how silly it is in the overall plot, but you would have to be foolish to give this movie a bad review just on that alone.I read some of the negative reviews on this site and all I can see is how they have only treated this movie like just another Sci-fi movie and that is a huge mistake.When reviewers evaluate a movie according to sci-fi and particularly the classic alien invasion plot, They immediately conjure up movies like War of the Worlds, Independence day etc. Movies whose plot can be summed up in a single sentence ""advanced alien race arrives in space ships and plan an invasion of earth"". That is the first mistake, thinking that that is why the aliens have come to earth. The true intension of the aliens isn't made very clear in the entire movie. Who they are? , Where they come from? , The reason they have come to earth. We get snippets and assumptions a few abductions, but that's it. The only thing even remotely indicates that this is an invasion is the number of space ships hovering in the sky, and this is when ""in the box thinking"" occurs, they drag up the 'Invasion' plot as a critical template. Lets look at a few criticisms and some alternate explanations.1) (The biggest complaint) Aliens come to invade a planet mostly made up of water and harvest humans who are made up of up to 70% or more which is harmful to them.Again the intension of invasion is not made clear, and just because they are hovering over earth doesn't mean they are planning to invade. Lets look at simple logic and psychology, The aliens are in full view hovering over the earth sending down small groups, to what seems to be primarily observation and capture of specimens. If we take the comparison of a man and a fire ant hill, The man believing he is more intelligent and superior to the ants has little fear of them so casually observes them and perhaps kills and takes a few for closer study. The 'Water' argument relies on the assumption that this is an invasion, alternatively perhaps they are just passing through, logging life around the galaxy or are were forced to come to earth looking to restock resources. At the end the aliens seem to have disappeared after reports of people attacking them which goes against the hostile takeover theory. There are many things that harm us which in the realm of science fiction can just be an everyday substance to other alien species i.e. the acid blood of the creature in Alien, So who is to say that logic can't be turned on its head to make up all sorts of crazy theories, the aliens might be mostly made up of gas, or potassium.2)The aliens were advanced enough to travel in space ships, but too stupid to get through a pantry door.Now this makes assumptions on the aliens' (The ones walking around) intelligence and that they are the same aliens who built the ships in the first place. Who is to say that these aliens aren't a less intelligent species used by a more superior alien race to do the dangerous work. Humans have used animal species to do all kinds of work through out history, in many cases training them to perform simple tasks such as sending messages, fetching items and more. Also What about the societal structure is it like ours or is it akin to a hive with drones, soldiers, A queen or more, a drone only has enough to get the job done and is only intelligent enough to carry out a few actions. Point is placed in a situation outside of its intellect it wouldn't know how to react. Hence the pantry situation even though it escapes eventually.3)Level of technical sophistication = Level of preparation.So the aliens did or didn't take into account that water a substance most deadly to them is everywhere on earth, or that their communication can be picked by a simple baby monitor despite their ships not showing up on radar of the most advanced military on earth. What if those two aspects are just coincidence. In war of the worlds the aliens were advanced enough to wipe out all human life on earth but died because of common germs humans had grown resistant to. Just because they are advanced doesn't mean they have taken every bit of human technology or situation into account. So little information has been given about the aliens we can't begin to make assumptions of how they function.------------------------------------------------------------------ I'll say again you shouldn't write this movie off because it doesn't meet your expectations. Instead watch it with fresh eyes and an open mind, that's what's so great about Shyamalan's movies, they delve into the unexpected and at times are powerful yet subtle. If anything watch the movie for the directing style alone witness the superb example in quality over quantity in cinematic direction.",Signs
1678,gjlp,Weak 50's style alien B-Movie but with decent actors,3,9 August 2002,"Definitely a case of the hype exceeding the reality.Decent acting spoiled by a weak storyline and 50's B-Movie style view of aliens.Surely, if alines had the technology to get here they would be a bit more intelligent than to be wiped out by baseball bats and glasses of water.The tv news sequences were really weak, unlike recent movies like Deep Impact that used tv news to add realism.The director should have decided at the outset whether he wanted the audience to be afraid orlaughinh hysterically.

1680,endless00,Worst ending I cam imagine,2,10 August 2002,"Showing the alien at the end with the boy was just a horrible idea.   It took away all the fear of the unknown that drove the film.  Then having Merrill hit it with his bat? I was wondering why Shyamalin bothered noting that Merrill was a baseball player, but then I found that it was to bring a fairly decent movie to a slopping ending that seemed like it was written by an eight year old. They discover that the aliens left because the people in the middle east found a primative method of defeating them, which was water.  The aliens were said to have probed the earth before their landing.  Wouldn't you think they would have seen that the earth is 75% water???  If water kills them, why would they want to invade a planet that will kill them?  Shyamalin has yet to write a fully quality movie, and he honestly seems to be getting worse at it.  Signs was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen.  It built and built to a point where fear was so deep in the viewer that it was amazing, but the ungodly poor ending just ruined anything that could have made that movie anywhere close to good.",Signs
1681,Artomegus,This movie is not about aliens.,9,10 August 2002,"***Note, I'm not going to discuss plot points but I will refer to components of the film that might be considered spoilers***I just laugh when I see so many people focusing on the last thing that this movie is about: aliens.  I get the feeling that people were expecting an action-packed alien invasion movie.This movie is not about aliens.  It didn't even have to be aliens; it could have been terrorists or animals or undead for that matter.The movie was about part of the human experience. The sense of danger was simply an element to magnify the theme of the movie. It was brilliant in my opinion.As another individual mentioned, this movie was a marvelous example of the deliberate pacing of a movie--an art that seems to have been lost since the early 80's.  People with short attention spans should definitely stay away from this movie.The movie also seems to follow a similar theme to Shyamalan's other movies (the first one was Sixth Sense, followed by Unbreakable) in that it is a story of beginnings--you are always left with the impression there are many stories that could follow out of the idea.Nicholas Meyer, the director of Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan among other movies, said something which reminds me of this film. I can't remember the exact words but he basically said that sometimes it the things that are deliberately omitted that make great art. M. Night uses this idea effectively--in some scenes we simply can't see what is going on, which serves to increase the tension and actually makes one *think* about the moment, and it draws you into it. This is a contrast to some of the other more flashy movies of late where the audience can passively watch pretty pictures for two hours, with total detachment.Well... enough rambling. I highly recommend the film, obviously.",Signs
1682,miron1,Religious vehicle and full of plot holes,2,11 August 2002,"**** Spoilers *********Very disappointing (2/10).This movie is a religious vehicle in a very heavy handed way.  At the beginning of the movie, the lead character is a reverend that loses his faith because of his wife's accidental death.  At the end, due to a ridiculous set of coincidences (i.e. a ""miracle"") he regains his faith. The whole alien/sci-fi thing is completely incidental - it could have been a non-sci-fi movie and it would have achieved the same goal.  It would have been nice to know it's a religiously inspired movie ahead of time - I would not have watched it.And let's talk for a second about the plot holes.  The aliens have to fight without technology because ""we would nuke them and make the planet uninhabitable"".  They use poison to kill their victims.  Why in the hell can't they have at least light weapons?  And if they are spread across the planet, why would we nuke them and kill ourselves in the process?At some point, the aliens carve large star and moon shaped holes in a door. But before that instance, they couldn't go through any of the barred doors in their way.  The protagonists fend them off nothing more than planks of wood and some nails.  If they can carve those shapes out, they can surely break down a door.  Give me a break.The kid forgets his asthma inhaler before going into the cellar.  You'd think he'd have it on his person.They keep dropping their flashlights for no reason.They walk around with aliens about but they take no weapons (such as an axe they previously used to bar a door with).And the list goes on...Oh, and there's a slow three minute flashback interrupting a 20 second action sequence near the end.  You'd think a professional director wouldn't make such an amateurish mistake in dramatic pacing.In all, it's the worst movie I've seen in years.",Signs
1683,Bent_Brush,Tripe. (Spoilers),1,11 August 2002,"This film suffers in so many ways as to be unable to list all of them in 1,000 words or less.I will attempt to give a brief synopsis of them.1) Politically correct beyond belief.
a) One of the main characters has a Cleft Pallet, this adds nothing to the story or to the fact that the character is fairly unlikable throughout the film.
b) The Police Officer is a woman, this rather unbelievable, the actress does not posses the strength of character to pull off the role.
c) The ""Farm Family"" has not one gun in their house. I lived on a farm and guns are a mainstay of that lifestyle, oh wait if they had a gun then the film would be a blood bath of people trying to defend themselves against alien invasion, can't have that.
d) ""Go to the Army recruiter when you think the world is in danger."" Yes as we all know, the military is the best place to be in an emergency. With such a proven track record how could it wrong?
e) ""The Television will give you 100% unedited Information."" Even in the United States where the Broadcasts are free from interference this type of Information would be kept quite and relegated to the Internet as a hoax.2) Card Stock Cutout Characters
a) Gibson is a fine actor and pulls off the role of a (married catholic) priest well.
b) Phoenix could not act his way out of a box. His character of the brother is flimsily and under developed.
c) Jones's Police officer, a main character with out any contributing qualities, used more as a plot device.
d) Small town Folk are always close-minded and vulgar, the booksellers, the Girl behind the Counter, the guy at the Army registration office.
3) The story is extremely contrived.
a) Throughout the film we get flash backs to the death of this man's wife and it has little to do with any thing happening in the film till the end. It turns out that there is an unseen overwhelming force that binds everything and forces destiny to happen.
b) The baby intercom can pick up those signals but the government can't, or if they are, they are not saying any thing, which would make my part 1E even more correct.
c) ""Maybe if we hide in this hole they won't be able to get us"". Yes everything in the house is prepared for the invasion, with the exception of the final location. The basement.
d) During a life or death situation it makes total sense that a person would be thinking about the death of their wife and her last words rather than thinking of a way out of the situation, of course this leads up to the next contrivance.
e) At the end the ""Father"" regains his faith, because at this point ""The Force"" has finally proven that it exists by having given him a hint some six months earlier.
f) Convenient that water, a MAJOR component of the Earth, is what kills the monsters. It makes total sense that an alien species would not know that over 1/2 of the world they are going to be invading is extremely lethal to them and won't take any precautions.4) There are some totally missed opportunities in this film.
a) Over and over the little girl mentions that this event or that even was in her dream, this is never fully explored.
b) The real reason the brother is home is never fully explained. Yes he is there now that the wife died but the viewer gets the feeling there are other reasons as well.
c) An opportunity to see the town's agitator at work so as to add some level of belief to the concept.5) The only saving grace in this film is the children.
a) Abigail Breslin, perfectly portrayed the part of the little girl with a bit of a mental disorder and a gift for understatement.
b) Rory Culkin, who would have thought a Culkin could actually act. This young man has talent and as long as he avoids the pitfalls of his older brother he will go far.Over all M. Night Shyamalan serves up exactly what you expect, no surprises only a lot of social programming. The USA needs a feel good film and this is it.",Signs
1684,acschurr,So much potential...,6,11 August 2002,"SMALL SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN.Unfortunately, no matter how rosey your glasses are, Signs is your basic ""rediscover your faith"" movie that has been done to death over the years, this time thinly veiled as a sci-fi thriller.  Even worse, it was obvious this was going to be the case right from the ""there are two kinds of people"" monologue about 30 minutes into the movie.Don't get me wrong, at the end of the day I did enjoy this movie - it had some nice humour, good suspense and (if you ignore the spiritual stuff) a reasonably good plot.  I particularly liked the way you (the viewer) knows no more about what's going on than the rest of the characters - the deliberate lack of the usual ""eye-of-god"" viewpoint was refreshing.The sad thing is that at the end of the day this was a very shallow and predictable movie from quite early in the piece (although that being said, the marketing revealed very little of what the movie was really about - reminds me a bit of ""Dangerous Minds"" in that regard ;)  ).  A typical ""along for the ride"" type fiasco where you don't actually have to any thinking for yourself - unfortunately all too prominent in Hollywood.  I personally don't like having all the details laid out for me, but it appears that I'm in the minority.  Interestingly, this reason was exactly why I liked The Sixth Sense so much, but it was obviously wrong of me to expect more of the same.I said above that the suspense was good, but I did feel it was overdone - A bit of a one trick pony really - the only really effective and (vaguely) original use was the scene near the end where the (presumably two) aliens were stomping around outside - *very* good use of the surround sound too! I agree with a lot of the previous posts that the ""amature video"" scene, while being 'scary', actually took a lot away from the intensity of the film - fear is largely based on the unknown, yada yada.One interesting point, on a personal note, is that this movie did make me feel a bit uncomfortable.  I was thinking about this, and came up with the following conclusion: because I believe that it would be very arrogant of us to think that we are alone in the universe, this scenario, while not probable, is (IMHO) quite possible.  The basic level of fear was quite effectively communicated in several scenes (ah, so much potential, Mr. Shyamalan!) and this in turn translated into quite a primal feeling within myself.  So much so that I found myself checking nervously over my shoulder while sitting reading these posts at about midnight after seeing the movie. AH! you say - that was the point of the movie... unfortunately, not so - please refer to first paragraph.  However, it does hint at the talent of this particular director, not seen since The Sixth Sense.There was so much promise in the opening minutes of this film, including good development and some excellent screenplaying, all ultimately betrayed by the ""human"" element.  A solid 6 out of 10.Aidan",Signs

1686,fuzebox,Waste of time and money,1,12 August 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan lucked out with The 6th Sense.  Unbreakable was a harsh disappointment, and now Signs is even worse.  Shyamalan seems to have a problem with building a plot.  He has excellent ideas, but when it comes down to assembling an interesting movie that actually makes sense, he falls quite short.  His ""plot twists"" and ""surprise endings"" are getting worse and worse.Let's break this movie down.  Forget all the amazing similarities to Panic Room (child who requires regular medication?).  Forget the cheesy lines. Forget the wasted ""suspenseful"" scenes where Mel walks around outside, tells his dog to shut up, and returns to the house.  When you strip all the inconsistencies and all the fluff, you are still left with a disappointing movie with a empty plot and poor excuse for a ""surprise ending"".I was expecting some sort of a revelation.  Maybe my hopes were too high, but the movie essentially being about a greater power telling everyone to hit the alien with a baseball bat fell short.  And don't get me started about the aliens.  Who invades a planet composed primarily of water, buildings, and humans with basically unarmed beings who cannot open locked doors, melt like the witch in Wizard of Oz, and can be beaten to death by any guy wielding a bat?  All of this while wearing green spandex, and carrying poison gas devices with a range of 4 inches?If you were going to create a movie based on faith and preordination, why pick such off-the-wall elements?  To prove that even the most strangest of coincidences can become clear in the end?  I howled with laughter when Mel exclaimed his hopeful ""that's why he has athsma; his lungs were closed"". It was obvious that Shyamalan was trying much too hard in this one.I wouldn't even give this film a ""wait-for-the-rental"" reccomendation. Don't believe the hype, it isn't worth your money.",Signs
1687,krowman88,Polished Turd,1,15 August 2002,"What a Joke? I can't believe how this movie is getting hyped up at this website. There is really not a story line, just sudden screamers, like dog barking and such, a cheap one at that. Frankly I think Gibson is a poor actor and in this he is even worse, maybe he is getting his payments in installments.

1688,davescool2001,So good I saw it twice,10,12 August 2002,"Yes, I saw the movie twice within the period of a week.My first thoughts after the movie were along the lines of ""good movie, yet some things could have been improved on"" when I saw it the second time, I took into consideration the great camera work and other small details that really made Signs come together (when seeing a movie for the first time, one doesn't usually sit down and analyze it for its true meaning). I wont sit here and tell you what I think the deep down hidden plot of the movie was, nor will I talk about a such and such scene where Mel Gibson does such and such with his kids. I will say that this movie is great, not quite as scary as The Sixth Sense, but I believe Signs wasn't intended to be a knock off of The Sixth Sense.To sum the movie up in a nutshell (ah what a cliché that is): A small town farmer finds a crop circle in his backyard (yeah we saw that in the preview). Mel plays a single father (wife died) who lives with his two --surprisingly smart for their age-- kids, and aliens stop by for a cup of tea. That is all that can be safely said about this movie, other than ""go see it!""Will you like this movie? Well that depends how you enter the theater, if you are a Sci-Fi horror buff like myself then you will enjoy the movie, if you liked the ""makes you think"" aspect of The Sixth Sense, then you will have no problems sitting through this movie, and leaving with an intrigued look on your face. I will say one more thing before I go, Signs had me thinking ""how in the heck are they going to end this movie?"" which is a very good way to keep the audience attentive, and involved in the show.",Signs

(I gave it a ""2"", and was being generous).I saw it based upon the reviews that it was not an alien film, but an examination of what is important in our lives - ""a thinking persons' sci-fi movie"". Well, I didn't think much of the film. Although about half-way through the film I was afraid, I was afraid that I wasted $14 - and I was right.The acting is poor - by everyone except maybe Graham's daughter. The characters did not react in a believable way. All of the ""there are no accidents"", ""everything happens for a reason"" and ""it is almost like it was meant to be"" is very contrived. This movie is about as deep as a Wal-mart wading pool.This, in conjunction with the obvious technical flaws, and ""loose ends"" made this a complete waste of time and money.I guess it goes to show you, if you've got a big star and director - Roper & Ebert will give you a good review.

Save your money or see something else.",Signs
1692,luckyduckie22,"Unlike Merrill, M. Night does not strike out.",9,14 August 2002,"Shyamalan's movies are characterized by chilly camera angles and eerie soundtracks, but his greatest talent is in understanding his audience, and how they work.  Consequently, this movie is one of the funniest I've seen in a long time, as well as the scariest--he alternates between the two to give us time to recover. So while it is spooky, the suspense is not always at a high level, making the movie enjoyable and the jumps and screams fun. I will be the first to admit,though, that I was a bit reluctant to turn off the light the night after seeing it.Most of the complaints about this movie seem to be about its implausability, which is odd, as movies are supposed to be a break from reality.  If you really want something realistic, go watch a documentary.  And as for complaints about the aliens themselves, Shyamalan's neatly skewered you with Proffessor Bimboo's book, and Merrill's theory on The Nerds.Well written and well acted, it's interesting to note how few people there are in this movie.  Four main characters, two supporting, and a few people we see only once.  This adds to the feeling of isolation, and it allows us to really get to know the Hess family, especially Graham (Mel Gibson). Gibson does an excellent job in this movie, portraying the ex-reverend with a sublime subtlety; he never over-acts, but moves seamlessly from gentle humor to fear and terror.  You can't help but empathize with him.The rest of the cast is great, too, M. Night can act as well as write and direct.  Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) provides effortless laughs, and the two children, police officer, et al, are quality.The actual direction does not dissapoint, either, and the details are what make this movie great, not just good.  The circle patterns on the curtains, the sense of timing that makes everything fit together in the end and still be surprising, the alien pattern on the tv as they finish boarding up the house...look for these things and you will enjoy the movie that much more.Alfred Hitchcock remarked that a good thriller should play the audience like a piano. If you see this movie, you'll be putting yourself in Shyamalan's hands, to be frightened and humored, and as Merrill might say, stiiiiiiiiimulated.  So do yourself a favor, if you go to see this movie intent on picking it apart, just stay home.  But if you want an enjoyable hour or two, which will stick with you and may even provoke thoughts, then see this movie and enjoy.",Signs

1694,dbcoolio,i liked it,10,25 August 2002,"i liked this movie a lot first off, i think perhaps the title doesn't refer to the signs of the aliens coming but rather to the signs to mel Gibson that god does exist. also appealing to me was how this supposed horror sci-fi thriller turned out to be very spiritual in nature.  i can also see how this would be disappointing to those of little faith out there.as for the weak plot, it was only weak as far as the aliens go, and I get the feeling that that is what night wanted.  it makes you stop thinking about the aliens so much, which would be distracting to the hidden story. kinda brings out the issue of faith again.i also really enjoyed the ending because there all the little signs that had been posted for Mel finally came together, just how little things that seemed kinda weird at the time turn out to be evidence of a higher power. getting you to trust in the lord and not lean on your own understanding.some one said that they thought it was very formulaic, but i don't see how a sci-fi film about god can be formulaic.  actually seems to be the opposite.The surprise ending is that it is about god and not aliens. (as it was advertised)this movie is incredibly appealing to some and not to others.  If you want a spiritual and philosophical work for the soul i recommend it.  if you are looking for the horror thriller that has lots of cool special effects and gory fight scenes i wouldn't want to waste the movie on you.",Signs
1695,protohuman,Signs: Hollywood is going down,1,20 August 2002,"To me, this movie is made based on a presumption: audience are a bunch of fools and they just accept everything the movie has to tell! Well, maybe some of the audience are, but not everyone.When I watched the trailer, I thought this was a horror/supernatural movie. 20 minutes into the movie, I told to myself: ""No, this is not a horror flick, it's a sci-fi movie. That's cool!!"" But, as the movie dragged and drew to the end, I knew I had again wasted my good money on a bad movie. However, this movie particularly aroused my anger because it failed to give a reasonable explanation of its main plot. It even failed to give us a direction to use our imagination. I felt insulted when I walked out of the theater...Some defenders claim this movie is all about ""faith"". Well, if I want to see a movie about ""faith"", I have tons of better choices than this garbage. (A beautiful mind, Good will hunting..., to name a few.)

I was disappointed when I realized it was about Mel Gibson's character's faith and not the aliens. It took me a couple of days to realize this. ""Oh, Signs, I get it."" I walked out of that movie entertained, confused and with a very unsubtling feeling in my gut. I've never such conflicting feelings for any other movie in my whole life.

1697,aobrien22,Disappointment (this review contains a spoiler),3,16 August 2002,"I usually stay to see the credits at the end of the movie; I didn't bother this time.  The premise was great, but the delivery was poor. The family's farm is located outside Philadelphia - not in the middle of nowhere.  But their crop circles don't get the same media attention as all the other circles throughout the world. No planes go over that part of Pennsylvania??  When it is learned that the aliens use the circles for navigation (what a clever idea, haven't heard that one before), the family stays there and it not encouraged or forced by anyone to leave (like the police or the national guard).  And then one of the main ""emotional"" scenes in the basement when an alien tries to attack the little boy, the aliens conveniently decide to leave.  I guess they knew the movie was nearing 2 hours.  Aliens are so thoughtful.  There is no real explanation of why the aliens are there, why they leave, etc.  Background on that is given by the boy reading from a book about aliens.  I expected more than cliches from Shymalan.  Why didn't he make the aliens malevolent? In general, the acting was good.  However, Mel Gibson was not well cast in this.  His ""emotional"" scenes were forced and overdone.  But then, the script was pretty weak, so it is hard to say if anyone could have really done any better. Wait for it to come out on video - and it really doesn't matter if you're alone or not.  It is not scary at all.",Signs

And for you people out there thinking ""Aw, come on it can't be that bad!""  well, my friend, it is.  The acting was not only bad, but down right freaky.  At many parts in this movie, it had me wondering whether the whole Hess family weren't aliens themselves.  And don't get me started on the cop.  I still think she's from another planet!  From the very beginning of the movie when the kids discover the crop circles and start freaking out, I knew this was going to be a weird movie.  Think for a moment how actual kids there age would react if they saw something like that.  They probably would have come running back in the house yelling ""Daddy come look!  It's so cool!""  Not nearly as freaky as these kids acted.  It's like they were reacting to the situation as if they were much older.  I didn't find this movie very scary either.  I found myself laughing more than anything.  The only thing worse than the actual movie is the fact that I wasted 7 bucks and 2 hours of my time.  And what could possibly be even worse is the fact that there could be a sequel: remember what the boy said about the aliens coming back later with a much bigger army?!

Yes, Mel Gibson's performance was pretty good but, come on, as good as ""Braveheart""????? That's just a load of b.s. Even in ""What women want"", Mr. Gibson had done a better and more enjoyable acting job. Same goes for Joaquin Phoenix. This was very sad comparing to ""Gladiator"".

1703,militisinvictus,Not worth the movie ticket. Sad but true. Lowest rating.,1,19 August 2002,"I must warn everyone that this movie is really, really weak. It relies mainly on cheap ""noise shocks"" to make the audience jump. The characters are quite unbelievable, and much of the plot is senseless.HERE COME THE SPOILERS. Some Signs apologists will try to say that this movie is not about the aliens. I can see why they would say that, because this main plot line is atrociously thought out, and utterly indefensible.You have the Earth being invaded by aliens whose intelligence gets them all the way through space to our planet, with ships capable of cloaking themselves. But then, that's where the genius stops, quite abruptly. You see, they have come to a planet that is 2/3rds water (which is toxic to them) in order to ""harvest"" human beings, who are also mostly water (hence water present in their dwellings). Human beings also have a proliferation of weapons, and yet what do the aliens bring, besides their gangly bodies? Nothing. (BTW, I love how a humanoid body strong enough to jump up to the roof of a farmhouse can't kick down a pantry door!) Their natural weapon is a gas-emitting spike on their wrists. That's all they use! Not a very wise choice for conquering the Earth now is it? And what makes them think they could rely only on their ""poison gas"" to harm us, when our basic physical properties are so different? Finding out whether your only weapon works after traveling light years to the battlefield is not very wise.So where do these practically unarmed geniuses land, after their ""recon"" mission is complete? Among other places, the United States, the most effectively armed nation on Earth. Wouldn't it make more sense to go ""harvest"" the more defenseless humans in Africa, who have practically no infrastructure? Well it might, if the writer/director had worried as much about the story as he did about getting Mel Gibson to cry for him.The aliens use mere radio waves to communicate (did the FCC give them authorization?) to each other, which somehow doesn't alert the military, who could at the very least have started jamming it. But hey military, shmilitary, this director is afraid of guns, so the defenders of our nation get no mention.Another archaic tactic the aliens use is marking targets with- tada! crop circles! Nobody will suspect a thing about these giant areas of crushed crops, will they? Of course not! And using a less obvious, more technologically advanced method of designating targets (we already do it with lasers or GPS) is out of the question.But wait, maybe the aliens aren't the dumbest folks around this town! How do you like the fact that Mr. Gibson knows there is an alien trapped in some guy's pantry, but doesn't call the cops! I can understand if he's a wimp and doesn't want to open that door to take on an alien himself, but at least call someone who will! Great, just leave it for someone unsuspecting to find...This is an over-riding theme in Signs- leave everything up to someone else. Mel leaves the alien in some fool's pantry, then goes home and boards up his house. He doesn't even take steps to arm himself so he can protect his family. Do you know anyone else as useless as that? Would you leave it to the rest of the world to protect you from the aliens who are in your house looking to kill you? Shammie fails to create a believable character. It's also hard to picture the sunken-chested, narrow-shouldered Joaquin Phoenix being a home-run champ. He's a cool actor (8mm) but an athlete he is not.Sure there's some good crying and flashbacks to a dying wife, but did director/writer Sham have to use aliens to tell it? Of course not. They implied the supernatural/alien plot in the trailers to pack you into the theater. From there, it's every sucker for himself...Don't support junk movies! You deserve better!",Signs
1704,res0mklt,"Hitchcockian elements done well, but poor sci-fi ruins movie",4,22 August 2002,"Some say that ""Signs"" is a movie that must be appreciated for its human elements, a salute to Hitchcock, where the plot is not so important as the experiences lived on the screen.  To director/writer Shyamalan's credit, the first 30 minutes is a fun ride, displaying lovable quirks in the characters and several ""boo!"" moments that are uncommonly innocent in their setup and resolution.  But the lame sci-fi elements and the religious grandstanding at the end simply ruin the movie.SPOILER ALERT:  If you don't want to know who is making the crop circles, don't read further.The trouble with ""Signs"" is that it builds up to something that requires a solid plot in order to carry the movie's end.  This movie is built around the experiences of the Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) family as a result of the aliens who created the crop circles.  In the beginning of the movie, Mel and his little brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix, whose distinctly un-muscular build makes him poorly cast as a former minor league hitting champ) try to corner the crop circle artist, but seem to be dealing with a foe who can jump from ground to roof and scamper off into the corn fields like a superhuman.  Throughout the movie the aliens are scaring the living daylights out of everyone, what with crop circles on a massive scale, animals sensing something really spooky, and space ships that are hovering over big cities but somehow cloaked to invisibility during the day.We see through a series of flashbacks why it is that the Hess family is in a constantly on the edge of complete emotional breakdown, and Graham explains to his brother that he has completely lost his faith in God and concludes every person is on his own.  ""There are two kinds of people in this world,"" he says, people who believe God is guiding our lives, and people who believe that life is a series of coincidences/random occurrences.  The plot that Shyamalan is interested in developing is how Hess shall regain his faith and the love of his shell-shocked family.Where the movie starts to feel cheap is where the aliens begin to show themselves but they have absolutely none of the superhuman strength displayed at the beginning of the movie, nor any degree of intelligence that must be expected of a race traveling through space and carefully plotting to pillage the earth.The aliens are simply pathetic and the ending feels like a sham in order to wrap it up in under 2 hours and deliver the dramatic payoff.  And the payoff may work for some people:  the people who believe that God is guiding our lives in intricate detail.  For the rest of us, this movie concludes with a heavy-handed theology statement by Shyamalan that, together with the ridiculous resolution of the alien problem, simply ruins the good feeling the first half of the movie gave us.I rate this movie a 3 out of 10.",Signs

Once you get beyond the first few scenes, which are incredibly slow and stilted, there's none in sight or even any mention of them.  M. Night Shyamalan drags things out over the first 75 minutes and doesn't develop what turns out to be the theme until the last half hour.  Even the extraterrestrials seem to play bit parts as this film boils down to one man's struggle to find his faith.  Mel Gibson, as Father Graham Hess, had some good emotional scenes, but I was surprised he allowed the denomination of his character's religion to be blurred since his faith is so important in the end.

I noticed a lot of bad comments about this movie on the site and was very surprised to read some user comments. This movie was incredible, with some strong acting from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, along with some other solid acting from the children in the movie.  This movie has you anticipating what will happen next, and it is great as the tension and uncertainty builds up within the viewer as the movie progresses. When we first see an alien on the streets of South America, that particular moment absolutely shocked me (along with the majority of the audience), seeing what appeared to be an alien sneaking around the streets in broad daylight. This movie does a good job with how the aliens look, as they look creepy and strange, yet not as far out there as the aliens in Independence Day or Aliens look.  M Night Shyamalan is a cinematic genius.  This movie was actually surprisingly funny as well, providing some uplifting moments during some tense parts of the movie.  This movie is also quite emotional as well at times, like when Mel and his family are having their ""last supper"" at their dining room table. The ending  is incredible.  It startled the hell out of me.  What else can I say, this movie has everything that I want in a suspenseful thriller.  M Night Shyamalan again has made another hit movie in Signs.

1713,indrapramit,"Signs is a truly frightening and expertly engineered reinvention of the ""alien invasion"" sub-genre.",7,2 September 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan has finally completely convinced me of his creative genius by following up two brilliant films(both surprising and powerfully original explorations of familiar and time-worn genres)-The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable-with yet another that not only lives up to his previous works, but in some aspects even surpasses them. Signs is everything I hoped it would be, and definitely more-Shyamalan has personalised the ""alien invasion"" sub-genre, which has spawned explosive and grandiose special-effects laden blockbusters like Independence Day as well as classics like War of the Worlds and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, with truly amazing results. In Signs, Shyamalan focuses on a single family, and (might be considered a SPOILER)unfolds a worldwide alien invasion through their eyes, wrapping this entire scenario with an issue of lost faith. What results is riveting, truly frightening, moving, funny, meaningful, in turns, and most importantly of a palpable intensity that is so lacking in most newer ""horror films"", or most films of any genre in recent times, that it will leave the viewer breathless and completely taken aback-most pleasurably, that is. Note that pleasure is used simply for lack of any other word-Signs will do far more than stimulate the nerves with mild entertainment. It moved me to heights of emotion, be it fear, anxiety, nervousness, sadness, and many other hues of the mental spectrum.

It is definitely one of the best films this year, and I recommend it highly.There was a lot of negative criticism about the plot holes and the ending of the film. I am not here to justify Shyamalan's logic but to address the main criticism, if the aliens are water averse why are they here? Well, why do we assume the aliens to be that smart? Just coz they can travel across galaxies???? Cant they have weaknesses that they are not aware of? Just coz we have been exposed to films that portray aliens to be distinctly superior to humankind or read books that translates the same, are we to assume that they have no weaknesses at all? Maybe, their weakness is water, and they are not aware of it.The ending, heavy-handed as it is, could have been better. That got me thinking on the possible endings. My friends and I came up with a few but they were either ludicrous, lame or predictable. Unless some of the reviewers can come up with something smart, I think any other ending that Shyamalan would have drawn up would have met with just as much criticism or disappointment.It is a pity that the director came up with 'The Sixth Sense' as his first film, and it is all the more unfortunate coz most of the users are criticizing 'Signs' in comparison to that film.'Signs' is a good film in many aspects. I enjoyed it thoroughly for its execution, and if people stopped dissecting the film as much, they might also enjoy it. The acting, the camerawork, and the music complement the film very well.I rate the film 8.5 out of 10. ENJOY!!!",Signs

1716,erichough,Not in favor,5,30 August 2002,Went in with high expectations for a film that might raise an eyebrow and promote some thought on the subject of alien visitors. Was unfortunately treated to essentially a horror film with an alien as the monster. All hopes of a profound film dealing with crop circles and their meaning were quickly dashed with a scene nearing the end of the film. I was largely disappointed.,Signs

Seeing ""6th sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" earlier i expected a great scary movie with an interesting storyline. But no such thing. The movie wasn't scary, and had a really thin plot. DONT SEE IT!!Let me illustrate this with one of many examples (spoiler!): It turns out that water will kill the aliens - so I am wondering: these aliens - smart enough to invent invisible spaceships (which I guess is a sign of quite advanced technology) - arent smart enough to invent a raincoat to protect them from water! - instead they wander around with no protection on a planet made up by 3/4 of water. Pretty lucky that it didnt rain the day they invaded...",Signs

I really enjoyed how well the movie blended humor with suspense and the science fiction aspects.  Plus, the ending had a nice salute to the War of the World from the 1950's.  I've always felt that after a movie was over, if you said to yourself, gee that didn't seem like nearly two hours, then the movie worked and worked well.  That's the feeling I had with this movie.

Up untill now I thought The Thing and Alien would hold my scariest viewing but oh no, Signs goes well beyond the use of models, suits, or robotics to scare you. The silence alone is enough to make you wonder if they're watching you ;) M. Night Shyamalan knows what scares people and deploys that tactic well in this movie. From the very beginning we see the mysterious traces of what could be hoodlums making trouble in a small farm town but as the movie progresses things begin to change. It isnt often that you hear the rest of the movie goers in the theater gasp at a dark silhouette or scream at the sudden appearance of...well, you'll see. After seeing M. Nights first two hit films, viewers are sure to pay special attention to tiny details, watching for what could be clues to a twisted ending.

People critisizing the movie are those who didnt get the story right....The movie may have some flaws but its forgotten by the screenplay of shyamalan. Mel gibson joquan phoenix had done their best. The cinematography is awesome.shyamalan scared us just using the most common objects like TV and Baby Monitor.The film shows how every major event or some unusual habits can be the signs of a greater thing to come. It will help you understand why an unusual habit of yours may be helpful in future and which may change the course of yourlife and i realised that something like that happened in my life. One of my unusual habits saved my life. The unusual habits and events that occur in your life are the signs of something you are about to face. The movie shows Bo's fear of contaminated water and morgons asthama phoenix's old bat and mel gibson's wife's death and her last words, all the above save them from the hostile alien.Over all the title signs itself gives you creeps when you think really deep. and the music and the background score especially the title sequence is breathtaking.I never get scared by horror flicks but this scared me in a very unusual way as it is something close to my life.anyways this movie has become one of my all time favorites.

Of course not everything was perfect like the aliens and water condensing the aliens would die since they have a weakness and that is water. Take this for example: In the movie, they say everything happens for a reason. His son had asthma and if he didn't he would of died from the poison. If his daughter Bow didn't think the water was old and gross, they couldn't of killed the alien by hitting him into the water. If Grahm's brother didn't have the bat he set the record with on the wall, he couldn't of hit the alien into the water and if Grahm's wife didn't tell Grahm to tell Marrel to swing away, he wouldn't remember the bat on the wall.

Night Shaymalan seems to a people's golden find.It's not often America agrees on a rising talent. With Signs, I really don't think people came to the movie to see Mel Gibson, but they saw it for M. Night. This is a wonderful fluke in the movie business. Aside from Spielberg, people simply do not attend a film based on the director. One of the most terrific thing about this film is that it works on more than one level. Without spoiling the film, you'll be hard pressed to hear them talking about the thing you're watching. The movie works on a visual level and then surprisingly it works on an auditory level as well. This is weaved together in such a way that people of all sorts can gain some sort of enlightenment on the situation. The final scene is a beautifully muted scene that ties up the main character's story. Beautiful. I think it's best to say that this is Night's most mature film and I can't wait to see what he has planned next. He has mentioned that this is the last 'surprise ending/supernatural' movie for awhile, so it'll be interesting to see his take on other genres.",Signs

Perhaps he even over does it with the tension in Signs. The characters always are acting strangely, there is always something disturbing in every scene such that there are very few relaxing moments for you to breath again to contrast that tension. The problem is two things...first, the girl has a magical premonition and there is this whole ""prophesy"" thing going on which is NEVER done well in any movie let alone this one and second, the movie's central message is to have a certain amount of faith and believe in hope and humanity...but then they just have this goofy resolution to the alien invasion that fails to live up to the message.HOWEVER, the idea of showing a worldwide horror from the perspective of an individual family was absolutely BRILLIANT and truly terrifying in many ways.",Signs
1730,ph-jenkins,Poor ending betrays basically good movie,7,30 March 2003,"Lets do this in reverse order. The ending is laughable. It betrays the whole movie. And the script - The plot holes are amazing. Do people really jump to such implausible conclusions so easily. The boy gets a book (out of the millions of different books available about UFOs - all with different ideas about aliens - and this book is totally 100% accurate about the aliens plans). Mel Gibson seems to have lost a little of his edge with this film (which is a shame, as the majority of the budget must have gone on his salary rather than the script) I may be persuaded to watch it again, if it comes on to cable in a couple of years time, otherwise this is one to miss",Signs

1732,tomparmiter,The film is better than all the critics make it out to be.,8,1 June 2008,"Okay, just to clarify - this is not M. Night Shyamalan's BEST work. However, this movie is still good, and does not deserve all the abuse that seems to be hurled at it here.Within the movie, all the key points which people say make it an awful movie, are explained, and if you just think logically, you will notice this.Overly Relgious: Some people claim that the film is overly religious, however it is religion that is being promoted - it is faith, which is different. The movie can be interpreted many different ways; this is just one of them.Aliens have interstellar technology and cannot open doors: Aliens, like the name suggests, do not know our planet, and most likely have never encountered doors, and locked doors for that matter also, so they do not IMMEDIATELY know how to open them. HOWEVER if you notice within the film they are referred to as ""problem solvers"" which is how they discovered how to get into the coal shoot. This explains how the alien which Mel Gibson cuts its fingers off, must have learnt eventually how to use doors and get out of doors locked by a chair propped against them.THE WATER: This one is a biggy, and the main criticism of the movie: the fact that aliens get hurt by water. I do not think this is necessarily stupid. They might not have even experienced water until going to earth, and the movie never even theorises to where the aliens came from - they could have come from Mars, for all we know. It is the same story as War of the Worlds - no one is criticising War of the Worlds because aliens were defeated by viruses on earth - in fact people seem to applaud it. The aliens might not have encountered it yet, and when they did; they left the planet.Why would aliens come to a planet just to eat us? Surely they have other sources of food on their own planet - or if they have such good technology could do so? The suggestion in the movie is that aliens are vegetarians, and it seems that their natural resources, or their farming land or something went wrong on their planet, and they came to ours. It also seems that they have been pushed into such dire straights they have to resort to killing humans. There is no comment to them NOT slaughtering animals for food - as they killed the dog in the movie, and could well have eaten it. It seems that they just want to survive, whether it means killing humans or not.Why are they naked in the movie with no good technology for killing humans, or at least making them easier to eat? The aliens came from dire straights on their own planet so they could survive (supposedly) and if this were true, they might not have the technology at all, or available at this time for this kind of warfare - it might be new to them, or they could have left with non-or little of it. You have to remember that the film is just following the case of four people on a farm - who is to say other people in the world didn't run into more trouble.I hope this shows how the movie, isn't completely silly, and that it is in fact a good film.Thanks for reading.",Signs
1733,rhinojdog,Another M. Night let down (spoilers ahead),4,20 September 2002,"This had all the initial makings of a fantastic sci-fi feature.  But just like Unbreakable the story failed miserably.  Just so I understand:1. An alien race travels millions of light years in space crafts with Klingon cloaking ability yet have to mow arrows in fields in order to navigate. 2. They are able to blend in to their environment with chameleon-like ability, have super human strength, but can't break down a two inch door. 3. To incapacitate the human race they rely on poison gas emitted from a gland in their wrist and evidently must be approximately two inches in proximity for this to work. 4. Despite their technology they can be defeated with a Louisville slugger and a glass of drinking water.I would be able to overlook all of this if I was presented with a gripping story/unforeseen twists (eg. The Sixth Sense).  Instead I got a anti-climatic story about losing one's faith.  How does this stuff get made into a movie?!",Signs

Films like Panic Room, The Wizard of Oz, Invasion of the Bodysnatchers and Independence Day all get 'Borrowed' from heavily.I approve that Mr. Shyamalan attempted to include a religious note into the film, but the film as a whole seemed dis-jointed. Hardly flowing from scene to scene, appearing more like a collection of short and mildly related stories. Signs tries to be too many things to too many people, as a result the dischordant family life was washed over rather swiftly before it's resolution. The alien scenes seemed farcical, as if Mel Gibson's fee had taken so much budget the extra terrestrials had to be made of rubber. Cheap rubber.The acting and directing are first class (Mostly) but it cannot save a lack-lustre film/script from being disappointing.",Signs

The acting, writing, direction, camera work, and sound editing and score are so well meshed, they flow together as you forget that you are only watching a movie. The title is a metaphor with multiple meanings, the least important being the crop circles which are used in the promotional posters and trailers for the movie. The beauty of this movie is the way Mel Gibson's character lets us experience both the unbelievable societal events occurring, as well as a more profound inner transformation of faith and perspective. There are so many scenes to savor in this movie, ones that touch every possible emotion, and the ending is powerful and satisfying. It is impossible not to be swept up along with this story and its characters. Don't think too hard about the rationale for the alien invasion and the predominance of water on our planet-that is one of the only problems or flaws in the movie. Shyamalan leaves the viewer with closure, but questions, and room for different interpretations. A beautiful, mesmerizing, frightening, and uplifting movie experience!",Signs

1742,king_kobra,An expert at work...,10,23 November 2002,"Leave it to M. Night Shyamalan to take our expectations for a movie, turn them upside down, and still deliver a work surpassing anything we'd dared hope for.With `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable' the young director so immersed us in threatening, supernatural realities that we would follow him anywhere. When all roads led to remarkable twist endings, we loved him even more.It's with high expectations, then, that audiences greet his new sci-fi thriller `Signs.' And Shyamalan waltzes into the picture clearly aware of what's expected. He knows we're on to his trickery and will spot his clever little ending a mile away, and that knowledge assures that we won't.Shyamalan also uses the ongoing allure of UFOs and space aliens to sell a film that, ultimately, has little to do with either one.Despite the inescapable background noise, the movie is really about the emotional and spiritual journey of a rural widower named Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Formerly a reverend, he gave up his church after the death of his wife.When we meet him, his days are spent tending a large farm with his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), and children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). It's a simple life that's turned upside down when strange crop circles show up in his field. At first, Graham is convinced it's a prank, but then they begin to appear around the world, and the possibility of alien life - perhaps even an invasion - looks realistic.As the film runs its paces, it riffs on a number of themes more important than the crop circles themselves, but Shyamalan is smart enough to know he has to hang his hat on something. With that in mind, he hides his real issues within a first-class, neoclassical thriller. That means the scares come not from splashy, grotesque special effects but tight editing and suspenseful storytelling.From the opening frames, Shyamalan creates an atmosphere so eerie and tense that one literally feels tired by the time the film ends. But it's a good tired, the type that comes after working on something worthwhile and being aptly rewarded for the effort.It's safe to say nobody else could have directed this movie. The unique perspective is purely that of Shyamalan, who wrote, produced and directed.At one turn the film feels campy, at the next desperately serious, but Shyamalan has somehow melded the diversities into a whole that plays like real life. Since that's what most people look for at the movies, the payoff is big.Shyamalan also demonstrates an expert ability to build tension, break it with comic relief, then rebuild it. It helps that he has veterans like Gibson and Phoenix delivering the lines, but one gets the feeling this movie would have been great even without the megastars. I'm glad they signed on, though, because their names assure a big-time audience, and this is the type of film that deserves one.",Signs

1750,Tommmo,"A Refreshing Story, Fantastic Movie Overall",10,31 December 2002,"I really enjoyed this film, and would recommend it to others as it combines moments which appeal to a very wide range of audiences. Signs could probably be described as the other side of Independence Day: it doesn't focus on multi-million special effects scenes, and you never actually see any big battle scenes as the action is all on the 'home front' - the beauty is in the way that its told, leaving most of that to your imagination as you get a glimpse of the events unfolding in a realistic fashion. This is a refreshing feature in an alien movie, which normally would follow the genre and include explicit mass conflict, military scenes.The plot would be the only feature of this film that could be considered as slightly dubious. I won't include any spoilers, but the situation seems to be resolved slightly too quickly and I think it would have been nice to have prolonged the action for a little longer. However, Shyamalan builds up the suspense very well and manages to create a very atmospheric screenplay. Perhaps the alien isn't the most original creation, but I don't think this matters too much as the atmosphere around it is built up perfectly.
This movie rates very highly for me, I think any plot holes are far compensated for by a well-told story. Star Rating: 4.5 out of 5, Excellent Overall.",Signs

The aliens spent decades scouting and never realize that 75% of the planet is poison to them. If they had realized this, why did they not protect themselves from water? Not even a rain coat? Don't they know it rains on this planet? What if they attack someone who just got out of the shower? Or trip and fall into a swimming pool at night? And yet they run through fields of corn at night, somehow avoiding the dew. Have you ever been in a field at night? Obviously M. Night hasn't. Otherwise the aliens would have ran screaming back to their spaceships, looking for their first aid kits.And after they showed Gibson's wife dying, some guy in the audience said ""I bet his brother hits a home run on an aliens head!"". That was just too obvious, and yet this was supposed to be part of what gave Gibson his faith back.(And yes, we were at the very first screening of the film in our city)
I know the aliens were just a plot device to enable Gibson to regain his faith, but M. Night just got lazy on this story. That or he's just out of ideas. I thought ""Sixth Sense"" was pretty good in spite of some plot holes. ""Unbreakable"" was good but too long. Maybe he should try to do a movie without a gimmick ending.",Signs

I have been a great fan of hard core science fiction since I was a teenager, and I have always been fascinated with the possibility that we may not be alone in the universe. Films such as War of the Worlds, Earth vs the Flying Saucers and Close Encounters of the Third Kind were all awesome in their own right and for their time.  Although I found a lot to like, I must say I found Signs ultimately disappointing.Shyamalan has proven himself to be a moviemaker of the highest caliber having directed the brilliant Sixth Sense.  In Signs, his talent again comes through in his ability to grip the audience with rising tension.  I found myself in the movies grip, anxiously awaiting the payoff.  How was the Hess family, and Gibson's character's loss of faith going to play out?  I cared about the Hess family and their predicament.  Imagining myself in the Hess' place at the moment of seeing the alien figure on top of the roof of the neighboring building left me squirming in my seat.  The movies pacing is fine, the acting adaquete, but the climax left me feeling I had been cheated.Perhaps it is my love of hard core sci-fi that was the root cause of my opinion that this movie failed in the end.  The aliens were just too easy to defeat.  How is it that a race of beings with the technology to cross the void of space could so easily be tossed aside by just sprinkling a little H2O on them?  How would any self respecting alien super race have individuals that cannot find a way to get out of a closet, or break through a basement door?  Give me a break.The problem with this movie, and so many more Hollywood sci-fi flicks is that the writer or writers just lack the imagination and the general knowledge of science to really blow true sci-fi afficionados away.  It is in that regard that a movie like the Matrix was so brilliant.  Someone with some real imagination sat down and penned a screenplay that truly stretched the imagination of filmgoers and hard core sci-fi buffs in that one. In Signs, the aliens are laughable in their ineptitude.  I did not see how having faith had much to do with the alien races demise.  This was an alien race of idiots.Signs has already greatly appealed to the general film viewing public.  It will also appeal to the fans of horror/suspense in that the movie will grip you with tension.  It will most likely be disappointing to many hard core sci-fi viewers like me that would like to see a little more thought put into the powers of aliens, and how they are defeated.  Is it truly that filmakers lack the necessary imagination to produce high quality sci-fi, or is it that they just do not care enough?",Signs
1756,wilson75k,Horror of the best quality,10,23 January 2003,"Signs is the greatest horror movie made in the last twenty years. M Night Shyamalan has constructed a film which uses the camera angles as its main tool into scaring the audience. The best example of this is the scene in which Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is woken by his daughter and told that there's a monster on her roof, oh, and can she get a glass of water? Hess rises out his bed and in the background of the shot the camera shows the barn roof in darkness, then there is a flash of lightning and you make out the shape of the Alien on the roof. The best moment of the film is the news report on the T.V, where a man has recorded the Alien walking casualy past his window and when his children scream it could just as easily be you. The film is going to be a classic and I would recommend it to anyone who is good with D.I.Y and does not mind boarding up their windows before they go to sleep, cause its a lot of work I can tell you.",Signs
1757,mimikat46,eerie sci-fi movie. :),10,20 January 2003,"**A FEW SPOILERS** ok, i personally thought this movie was awesome. if you like aliens and stuff it's pretty good! it had a very nice storyline, and the outcome of everything was well put together. but what i didn't understand is what scared the aliens off in the end. was it the water? I'm not sure. But it's an enjoyable movie. And I think one of the best features of this movie is the music. it's an eerie kind of music, a bit scary, but thrilling at the same time.",Signs
1758,dreamer6683,"Even though this movie has a high-rating, I still believe it's underappreciated... that, and Gibson and his priestly demeanor are quite hunky",8,22 January 2003,"I saw this film in the theatre with my older and younger brother, and we loved it. It really hit home with the family storyline. Because there are only 4 central characters, they are all extremely likeable and fleshed-out. The acting is superb, and you really feel a genuine family feeling (particularly at the dinnertable scene, which still makes me emotional). The children in this movie are great (the little girl steals the show whenever she speaks). Gibson is great... like Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense, this is probably the most mature role that he's had yet. Joaquin Phoenix is HILARIOUS, and he played well off of Gibson. I read a review on this site about how you can see microphones in almost every scene. Truthfully, I saw Signs in a real theatre and I did not see any microphones. However, when I came to college and saw it again when it was showing at the school theatre, I did see the microphones. I thought, ""Thank God they weren't in the real edition that I saw,"" because they really did ruin the movie, especially with everyone laughing at the mics popping up during very intense scenes. Just know that the real movie does not have the microphones (do you honestly think Shymalan-whose name I cannot spell-and the producers would let something like that slide?). There must be a really early, uncut, or maybe just off-center edition floating around. Anyway, I love this movie. As everyone else has said, the suspense is handled extremely well by a masterful director. For those who have been bitching about unrealistic plotlines, get over it; how the hell can anyone know how aliens would act in a completely new environment? And if I were a member of a desperate species on the brink of extinction, I sure as hell would get to the first planet that I could in order to get nourishment, regardless of any impending weather such as rain. The one thing that I will gripe about with this movie is that seeing the alien is not so much of a letdown, but more awkward than not. When you see the alien on the TV (both in the news AND at the end through the reflection), it is quite well-done and terrifying. However, I would have rather not seen the alien as clearly as they showed it during the climax, because the computer generated effects took a great deal away from the movie. But to the filmmakers' credit, from the amount of suspense that this movie builds up, it would have been impossible to lead to anything that will please everyone (especially in the way that the alien looks). Other than the alien, the story's main strength is the family. It's one of the best *family* films that I have ever seen, really. The message of faith, not so much (to me) in a higher power, but in your family and in love, was quite powerful. And to top it all off, it's funny as hell. I still laugh at every part that I originally laughed at. Watch Signs... you'll laugh, you'll cry... hell, you'll probably soil yourself too.",Signs
1759,Joe_Dalton,totally illogical,2,29 January 2003,"Signs shall be treaded seriously or with humor, but not incoherently.the scenario begins great but looses its consistency at the middle of the film.

1760,bms-1,One movie that has some weight to it.,8,24 January 2003,"I have never seen a movie, that for most part, placed some real and possible facts concerning this type of movie. It addresses the reality issue rather than pouring a lot of hype and special effects into it. By gripping the human emotion and engaging our minds, we become part of the movie rather than just sitting back a watching. Mel Gibson played an excellent role and he has placed himself into the arena of harms way. This area has been watched over for years being guarded by big brother and the truth concerning this topic avoided. The timing for this movie was right.Personally I would like to see MR.Night make another documentary applying this movie one step further including the same actors, but on a deeper level. With a return of these aliens with a new perspective on warfare with humans. But, without a whole lot special effects, yet enough to keep the audience on the edge of there seat. With that same eye catching and engaging our minds as Mr.Night did in this wonderful movie--- SIGNS.",Signs
1761,tjohnsn63,"Pathetic - Mel, Mel, Mel....",1,26 January 2003,"This movie started with dark, cliche wispers and ended the same way. It never left the ground! With a plot borrowed from, oh let's say... Predator, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Night of the Living Dead and Mothman Prophecies... Poor Mel found himself trapped in a trite, loosely gathered web of B movie pictures from the 70s all wrapped up into what was supposed to be a block buster!?!  You know it's bad when the best special effects are a cornfield with bent stalks, clips from the old TV show ""Alien Encounters"" and a house.  A HOUSE for god sake where everyone sat on the sofa waiting for the poorly dubbed big foot out-takes to physically break in??  BAD AND PATHETIC FROM THE WORD GO!! (and I'm a Mel Gibson fan)",Signs
1762,jamesego_2000,Remember Land of the Lost?,2,1 February 2003,"*a couple of spoilers ahead*I knew that it had been nothing more than my willing suspension of disbelief that kept me from bailing on this craptacular, cinematic train wreck as soon as they showed one of the aliens on the news. I really wanted to be scared. Honestly. I almost had myself talked into it too. Then they showed the alien walking through the alley, videotaped at the children's party in Mexico. I couldn't fake it anymore. The poor actor lumbering around the alley in the alien costume was a dead ringer for a sleestack, from Land of the Lost. Remember that Saturday morning TV show? Remember the sleestack that could talk? He would walk around in his red dress, with his big pimp necklace on, apologizing for the other sleestacks behavior, because he was from the future, and he could see the flaws in their actions. This movie needed one of the aliens, from the future, in a red mini-dress, to say to us, 'Jeez guys, I'm really sorry about this blowing so hard. I realize this is all little more than a third-rate morality play that Rod Serling would have passed on forty years ago. And please don't ask me why they had to drag us aliens into it. Well, you can figure that out on your own, can't you? No one would pay to see this if it was just about some priest whose wife, then faith, was smooshed by a mumbling veterinarian, would they? No sir, they wouldn't. So they bring us in, with some cockamamie crop circles, a little static on a baby monitor, and PRESTO! It isn't boring anymore. At least that is what was supposed to happen. Oh well. Sorry.'
Plenty of holes, large enough to make one wonder if M. Night ever re-read ANYTHING having to do with this film, have been discussed elsewhere. Let's just say the films continuity is dicey at best. I know others have praised both of the child actor's performances, but I thought they were as one dimensional and wooden as that of the adult actors in the film. And whoever did the final alien computer animation should think about doing something else for a living. Perhaps open up a comic book store, or a frozen yogurt place. That has to be the worst thing I have ever seen. The nasty claymation scenes in the Sinbad movies looked better, and scarier, too.So why did I sit through the whole thing? One word. Tak. He still rocks, and with the exception of the horrible computer animation at the end of the film, it looked beautiful. Wow, there was something good about Signs after all.",Signs
1763,chauncyxxx,What,1,14 February 2003,"I'm sorry but this was one of the worst movies I have seen all year. I don't want to sound like one of those people who pick apart everything in a film but there is just SO MUCH WRONG with this movie. How could it possably be that these alians have the technology to come to Earth with the purpose of taking over but did not bring along the technology requred to break in to a farm house, or break out of a pantry? Where are there weapons? We have the technology to put a 2000 pound smart bomb on a target the size of a window from 30,000 feet using electronic guidence but these invaders must rely on crop circles to guide them in? Even if the aliens were just a backdrop to the rest of the story, it was done so poorly one must ask, who cares about the rest?",Signs

1765,jakke008,I don't know what the fuss is about.......,1,31 March 2003,"I've seen SIGNS last night and taking a look at what all the others think about it, I'm so surprised that I need to say in some words why this is, for me, a very very bad movie. The visual look of Signs is O.K., beautifully shot and good acting........BUT, the story ladies and gentleman! The earth is taken by aliens and they are not very friendly. The American way of scaring people: unknown intruders can be very dangerous..... I wondered the whole time through 'where' this story was going to, what is the ""shocking turnaroud"" as I've read everywhere. Oooooh, that everything is pre-programmed and coïncidence does not exist, so GOD exists.......Pfffffft. It's an interesting point to make a movie about but please please not with a sci-fi story like this. Sorry for the vagueness of this commentary, i'm not native English speaken but wanted to warn you for this movie. If you wanna see a good movie about time, destiny, coïncidence and the impossibility of changing (chasing) time, watch DONNIE DARKO......10/10and a debut-film !!!

1766,fastforward-704-441423,It's nothing special,3,4 April 2010,"Hi, this movie is really unconvincing, What struck me most was the dull acting by anyone. Especially the kids. It's like the writers were in such a rush they forgot to put in the emotions the actors should portray (like when Mel Gibsons son is grabbed by an alien, they all just sigh). This movie lacks a message (it could have had an interesting one considering the priest and alien life) But nothing happens that makes me wonder about these aliens and why they have come to this world and hang around in cornfields.It's as dull as a Mc Donalds hamburger, no particular taste so it appeals to more people. And it shows with a 6+ rating on IMDb.",Signs
1767,chris_sansom,Maybe they didn't realise water hurt them because they live on a planet without any,9,15 November 2012,"I've felt obliged to register an account just so I can answer some of the objections being raised by the negative reviews for this film.Foremost among them is the question that ""why does a super advanced alien race which has a weakness to water chose to invade one of the only planets in the universe with liquid water present?"" Most asking this question are presenting themselves as paradigm's of logic.But they state the answer to their own question within the question. Most planets in the universe do not have liquid water present. Therefore, it is possible, and even probable, that the invading aliens are from one such planet. It is therefore more than possible that they did not realise they had this vulnerability. I think humans would be caught similarly unaware if we invaded a planet an found we had a deadly vulnerability to the gaseous form of gold, for example (ignoring temperature as an issue.)Other criticisms are why such athletic aliens cannot brake into a boarded up house. However, they do brake into the house. Really quickly. They just avoid doing it via smashing through wood and instead find an easier way in. The latter option, to me, indicates a higher level of intelligence.I could go on, but I'm just going to say that you could either a) suspend your disbelief or b) stop trying to be the biggest intellects on the internetz. The film is wonderfully crafted, has a great score, the acting is first rate, and the culmination of several different plot threads into a singular tense ending is great. There is lots of things to like about this film, and seemingly a few to dislike if you really try hard enough.But don't try that, just enjoy it for what it is.",Signs

1769,shawn-771-698596,Movie so bad I had to sign up to IMDb to complain,1,22 June 2010,"I won't comment on the plot holes of this one, which were abundant. In typical fashion of watching M. Shyamalan film I was looking for the unique plot twist from the get go. I swear the first half hour I thought the plot twist was that everyone were B-movie actors a la the ""Truman Show"". The dialog was so corny and the characters were used so blatantly to explain the plot and their emotions.The ""explain the plot to the audience"" police character was a bit too much. It wasn't until they went into town and the army recruiter guy tells us the aliens are ""probing"" us with their crop signs I realized that the bad acting and HORRIBLE dialog was not a plot twist, but the signs of a director/writer with no critical ear.That he appeared on screen in something quite less than a bit part seems to really prove that this director's ego has run amok. Sixth Sense was awesome, I really enjoyed Unbreakable, but it really felt like this movie was really hamstrung by his need to provide us with his surprise ending, which completely fell flat. The movie felt forced, the characters were completely 2 dimensional, the dialog was cliché.Even the music for me was too much. It was an hour and a half of X-Files music, completely over-used so that any moments of real suspense felt mundane. Sorry, this movie was bad.",Signs
1770,fangningsheng,My favorite M. Night Shymalan film,8,28 July 2010,"This was a great sci-fi film. There was lots of suspense and creepy scenes. The acting was great, especially the part when Merril(Joaquin Phoenix) watched the alien walk across the road on TV. His jaw dropped and his face was twisted in shock, revulsion and fear. This was one of the scariest movie moments in my opinion. Personally, i thought that it was better than even The Sixth Sense. I would recommend this to any sci-fi or horror fans, or to any fans of M. Night Shymalan. It is generally appropriate for those age ten and up. Anyone younger than ten will likely be terrified by this film. I know i was, because the first time i tried to watch it i was nine, and i couldn't sleep for months.",Signs

The only thing getting me through the film was hope; to see one of Shyamalan's famous twists, but was very disapointed to find the climax of the film was a very poor CGI of a green alien. Shyamalan should stick to what he knows best not try and make it in the sci-fi genre.",Signs
1773,mrchipslewis,Signs is the ultimate movie,10,25 March 2011,"This film is one of my all time favorites.First off, I think it deserves more credit then what people have been giving it. Its called willingly suspending your disbelief. The elements in this film are Shyamalan's, which he imaginatively wrote and put together as he saw fit. So forget what most sci-fi resources would say in terms of what would be more likely to happen if aliens made contact with humans.Most of the entire story and events are revolved around the Hess family on their country property. The television and radio are the only things that even remotely show what is happening to other places around the world. This is extremely effective. It allows the audience to be more engaged and attached to the Hess family.The acting is phenomenal, absolutely pristine. This is my favorite Mel Gibson movie. His performance as a beloved father struggling to cope with the loss of his wife with abandoned faith is outstanding. The dinner scene and the ending is where he really works his magic.Joaguin Phoenix is a perfect addition to the cast, as a charming, yet still caring younger brother living with Mel Gibson.You couldn't ask for better child acting from Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin as the kids of Mel Gibson's character (Graham) The film is surprisingly funny. Quite frequently there are golden touches of humour in the first 3/4 of the movie.It is perfectly suspenseful. Not showing the audience everything at once, but little bits at a time is the perfect trick. Then when the ending comes around, Bam! ""Oh jeez this is intense!"" And lastly, it is tear-your-heart-out emotional. Deep down it is quite a sad story, as this family is struggling to survive, and Mel Gibson is barely holding his family together from everything that is being thrown his way. His battle with faith and God is one of the key elements, and I think it is spectacular how this conflict is finally resolved at the end.Amazing movie, perfect in every way. It is funny, suspenseful, emotional (I will admit to tearing up every time) The acting, the story, just everything is top notch. I recommend this to everyone. If you like movies at all, watch this, give it a chance. I want to see it have at least a 7.0 rating on this site, right now! come on!10/10------5/5------20/20, any variation of perfect",Signs

It's just so bad. I really don't know how logically the writer thought when he crapped out the script for this movie. I can try to give you a few examples:The aliens are intelligent enough to build the means necessary to travel to earth but not enough to realize that the planet they are trying to conquer has 70% water on it's surface and we all know how healthy the water was for them, not to mention that when it came to open a simple door they just couldn't...That really made me lose my respect for the once great Mel Gibson.",Signs

I'd hoped, wished the director would have had an new, original view on crop circles. Alas, it was the aliens again. There were other cliché's: the 'psychic' kid that gets messages from 'beyond'; we've seen that in Poltergeist and other movies. And the storyline of aliens at first being almost invincible and than suddenly dying of something stupid, ordinary, onnozels (well, look it up); that has been used before: In War of the Worlds it were germs that finished the aliens and in Mars Attacks! country music. Another thing I noticed. Although at some point in the story it became quite clear the aliens were here (crop circles, giant spaceships hoovering in the sky), when the aliens got down to the surface they moved around almost undetected.",Signs
1779,momtofabfive,I don't understand...,10,4 September 2011,"...why this film got so many bad reviews. I'm not a fan of aliens or horror films so perhaps these people are judging it by those standards. Maybe they came in expecting ""Alien"" or ""Nightmare on Elem Street"", so if that's what you're into you definitely skip this film. But if you're looking for a soulful, delicate and powerful film that makes you think about the bigger questions (God, coincidences, faith and hope) and offers some actual ANSWERS (something films have little of these days) you'll enjoy this film even if you aren't into aliens or horror.Basically, it's about Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), an Episcopalian priest who has just suffered a horrible tragedy that has made him lose his faith in God. He lives on a little farm with his two children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin)and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). One morning he wakes up and discovers crop signs in his corn field. He at first thinks its just some neighborhood boys horsing around but soon it is discovered that there is a full-scale alien invasion underway all over the world. The best thing about this film is how realistically the character's respond to this emergency. I think if anything this insane were to actually happen people would at first be wholly unbelieving, then skeptical, slightly anxious and then full-blown terrified. They would sit and watch the news all day, holding their loved ones close, board up their homes and hide in the cellars or pack up the car and drive as far away from the trouble as they could go. Most alien films move right to the aliens wreaking carnage after the first ten minutes and therefore they lose something, they become a simple fight/flight ride that we never really required to think about. This film for the most part never showing the aliens, only in glimpses, and therefore our imaginations are allowed to enhance the fear and tension. This makes it a slow-moving film, but it never loses that sense of anxiety, the feeling that somewhere out-there, something is watching you and waiting to pounce...The message of the film is a universal one: at one point Graham asks his brother what kind of person is he, one who believes in blind luck and happy chance, that you are all alone in this world, or are you a person who believes that there are no coincidences and that there is Someone up there, watching and taking care of things? I myself am a Christian, but I think no matter what your religion, you will be able to take something comforting away from this film. I have seen many Christian films that do not give such a powerful display of faith as this one and I respect Shyamalan for being able to pull this off without it once seeming cheesy. The acting in this film is wonderful; the performances or subtle and quiet, these are everyday people still fragile after a tragedy, yet powerful and genuine. I know Gibson has been criticized and judged these past years, but he is without a doubt one of the best actors out there and his performance is the linchpin of this film, he character is so obviously damaged and insecure, yet when called upon he gives such strength and power. Phoenix is a great supporting role, he is quirky and rather simple, but no less strong or deep than his brother. The children are great, Culkin and Breslin work to together seamlessly and exude genuine love and tenderness for one another. Cherry Jones has a small part in this film but she is excellent in her scenes and even Shyamalan himself has a small scene, a very emotional one and he is actually very good. When I first saw this film I was unsure if I would enjoy it, the slow pace and the subtly of the performances, but by the end all this payed off: I knew each character deeply and I was invested in their story, and the ending was one of the most moving experiences I have ever seen in film. Go see this film, you will not be disappointed.",Signs
1780,Mamasahick2,"I found a goof not listed in the ""goofs"" and some of my thoughts",8,26 July 2011,"A little corny but I love this movie and will watch it over and over. Probably how I saw the goof that isn't listed in the official list of goofs. When Graham is going down to the basement after everyone else, if you look up behind him, the door or window that is in the background already has the stars and moons etc cut into it. This is supposed to only be shown after it's all over and they all come back up stairs. My favorite part of the movie is when Graham is talking to Bo in the beginning and sees the first alien on the roof top. The music makes that scene great. My second favorite part is when Graham and Merrill are running around the house trying to scare off Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers!!! ""I'm insane with anger!""",Signs

If one wishes to have a movie about faith and redemption, fine, but don't trash a whole genre in the process with unbelievable sloppiness. Three years after seeing the film, I still feel insulted.Spoilers: Why would an intelligent life form capable of traversing untold distances and for whom contact with water is fatal choose a planet for invasion whose surface is predominantly water? Why would that intelligent life form be incapable of sufficient intelligence and tools to free itself from an ordinary locked room? Why would those beings choose to prey on beings that are primarily composed of that substance they find fatal? The list goes on and on, but the bottom line is that some director with no feel and, obviously, no respect for the genre choose that genre for his vehicle? Oh, yeah, name stars and $$$.

1782,Ejzuber-164-715225,Everybody's a Critic.,8,22 September 2018,"I've been a regular visitor to IMDb for quite a few years now, but lately I've found myself getting increasingly irritated by what I think is the biggest flaw on the site: the user reviews.Listen, everybody's got a right to their opinion, but many these commentators have barely got enough of a grasp of grammar, syntax and punctuation to construct a proper sentence. Beyond that, I see very little evidence of any semblance of knowledge of cinematic history or film production - certainly not enough to convince me of their ability to evaluate their subject with any clarity or insight. Instead, the unfortunately prolific contributors to this section seem keen to regurgitate catch-phrases and talking points from legitimate reviews, more often than not using their soap box to diminish a work that deserves the critique of a more skilled and thoughtful eye. ""Signs"" is such a work. It's an exciting, artfully-crafted and endearing film with a wonderful cast. Is it perfect?

1783,newskindotnl,Not your average alien film...,2,2 January 2004,"***SPOILER-ALERT***Imho, this movie sucks. And to be able to explain why it sucks, I have to explain the plot. Don't read further if you haven't seen it yet...Signs starts out like any other alien movie. Signs of alien life appear all over the world and an invasion seems inevitable. But in fact this in not a movie about aliens. It is a movie that deals with religion and belief. Towards the end this becomes more clear and you get the feeling that you've been watching a sci-fi version of the bible. All logic has been shoved aside and has been replaced with religious symbolism.The main problem with this film is that the symbolism takes over the story. The plot seems thin and weak, but eventually becomes clear. Everything is a metaphor. Aliens are apparently dumb-ass creatures, who are unable to open doors and can easily be killed with water, but in fact, aliens are demons. This becomes apparent when you realize that the aliens are not really invading the planet. They are here to get us, the humans. These aliens are actually being killed by some kind of ""holy"" water. The whole goal of this movie is to make you believe in the presence of a god, no matter what happens. The last scene, where Mel gets his faith back, is the most important scene in the movie. I, however, choose not to believe, and that is why I really dislike this movie. It felt like religious ""in your face"" propaganda, while I was expecting a good sci-fi movie. I'm disappointed, because I actually liked ""Unbreakable"", M. Night's second film...My rating: */*****",Signs

1785,Ethonaut,This will be a cult classic in the future.,8,29 November 2012,"Honestly, I don't understand why this film didn't receive the love it deserves. Maybe it's because this generation of audience prefers action and fact over allurement and artistry. Or maybe because it escaped the viewers' understanding of poetic story telling. The art of story telling has no restraints in any case. Any argument against a film's regard for scientific, historical, and logical accuracy is already invalid, because a film is not made to be truthful, it's made to be experienced.To see a film should be to have a dream. Sometimes dreams disagree with what is logical in this world, but it is the journey that captivates you. The way a story is told is what should define it. In Signs, all elements work together to create power in poetry. Never have I heard a film's score fit so perfectly to its mood. Camera angles and duration leave you hanging while throwing you into the story, letting you witness it as if you were there, as well as holding symbolic themes of which most viewers miss. The dialogue is real and philosophical, and whether a believer or not, will cause thought provoking attention. The story is fascinating and is supported by actors who completely capture the awe and disbelief of what they are experiencing. There are metaphors and allegory around every corner. There's tenderness and there's heart break, there's joy and there's terror, there's comedy and there's utter sincerity. You experience an alien invasion unlike any other, with an isolated family so blissfully ignorant to what is happening that it alone is terrifying. It is exquisitely genuine. Sometimes if you want to subtly and metaphorically portray a fault or weakness in a characters motive, you may make him unable to perform the simplest task of opening a pantry door or inability to come in contact with the purist of substances. In order to be a creative and intelligent story teller, you must sometimes break rules of logic. As a viewer who judges a film by its poetic integrity and engaging experience rather than its coherence with and regard to real life logic, I give Signs an 8 out of 10.",Signs

The little kid actors did such a good job & they were so cute. The special effects done for the news reel of the alien walking across the street was awesome. The scene where Mel Gibson is running through the corn fields & you see a hand or a foot of an alien was perfect. And, as always, the art direction was amazing. I found this to be M.

It was a nice touch how the water is what is the antidote to destroy the alien invaders. Very metaphoric I suppose. Also the film delivers in its hero portrayal.

There are several plot holes and several stupid plot points that make this an awful movie.One major problem that this film has is the plot point that says the Aliens have mastered space travel, but can't get through a door. What sense does that make? None.The design of the Aliens is also unoriginal and bad looking. I was expecting something better. I was genuinely shocked when, while listening to reviews of the movie on YouTube, that people actually jumped out of their seats in the theater when the alien was revealed.As a closing statement, I am shocked that Signs got 3 stars. Why? Because of how ridiculous and cliché the plot and acting is. All in all, Signs is a horrible movie and should not be watched.",Signs
1795,liulouis4,Criticisms Unwarranted,8,12 July 2012,"I personally disagree with many of the posts made by previous reviewers about how the plot holes ruined the movie entirely for them. First of all, this movie is fully enjoyable on a scale outside of the plot. One has to realize that the movie is not focused on the invading aliens, but the life of a father/pastor turned upside down after the death of his wife. This is an experience from his point of view, and his revelations and understanding of himself after another traumatic event equal to that of the death of his life. If you have not realized this already, the scenes do not focus on the aliens themselves, but the family, and Graham. Secondly, the critics of this film call it stupid because the aliens get killed by water, and that they are dumb because they invade the only planet with surface water in the entire solar system. There are several problems with this: as humans, you can't judge the intelligence of other species. If you really want to get sci-fi and all speculative, maybe they never knew about water as an element before, and therefore was not aware of its affects on them and maybe even not aware of its existence in the first place. Their technological advances, some claim, are absurd, because they can't be picked up on radar but can be heard on a baby monitor. The same thing applies-we don't know anything about the aliens, so it's completely ignorant to assume them to be dumb using human standards. And, really, would the movie have satisfied your sci-fi fetishes if they were killed by large nuclear missiles? Would more explosions in the film have made your experience better? The film is an exploration of human nature, NOT a lavish, ultra-Hollywood-style shoot-em-up like independence day. If you go to the movies for the explosions, and inception-ist plot, then you will miss a lot of great movies out there like this one.",Signs

The end was completely ridiculous: the alien looked a man with a rubber suit (acceptable in a movie in 1940 .. ) and if water was so dangerous to it, it should already have died as the air is full of it. Complete bullshit movie. The whole movie is full of boring moments, and the action is limited to a few man running around.

I figure it was to create an opportunity for it to come back at the end for revenge. All in all MNS did a good job at keeping you guessing, keeping you on the edge of your seat, and adding comedy into it as well.

It truly is his finest hour in film-making, with his suspense-thriller 'The Sixth Sense' coming in a close second.The film surrounds the plight of the Hess family, that is, Graham (Mel Gibson) the father, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) the brother of Graham, and the two children Morgan and Bo. They discover a series of crop signs in their corn fields, and as the movie unfolds the Hess family and the entire world is faced with a potential invasion from extra-terrestrials.Shyamalan truly is a brilliant storyteller. He uses brilliant setting, camera angles and lighting to leave you breathless. The casting is also brilliant, with Gibson doing a fine job as Graham Hess, Phoenix enchanting as Merrill, and the two children do a thoroughly capable job of portraying Graham's sometimes quirky children. Another fine feature of Signs is the musical score. Perfectly timed, the music is haunting and windy, helping the watcher's imagination to follow its path.This movie is worth a watch. Then another.

1800,chandra_locka,A genuine masterpiece!,10,21 January 2005,"Possible spoilers! Although I believe nothing can spoil the joy of something so great!First, to all of you screaming: HOW COULD ALIENS BE STOPPED BY A SIMPLE WOODEN DOOR?!!!, WHAT ABOUT THE AIR HUMIDITY?!!, ETC.... - People, what's wrong with you, do you really accept this movie as an ALIENS-INVASION-SCI-FI crap. This movie's got nothing to do with aliens. What is more it is amazing how a movie can be based on the ALIENS-ARE-COMING-TO-KILL-US-ALL-AND-EVERYTHING'S-GOING-TO-HELL cliché and still be a real masterpiece. 'cos nowadays what else do we have got left to use but clichés. But only a genius can arrange the old clichés and recycle the past in order to produce something interesting. The aliens are simply a symbol of what exceeds human capacity for understanding, a symbol of anything supernatural or beyond. Anything else could be used successfully instead of aliens as long as it was supernatural enough. THE ALIENS is fine by me. It's absolutely unimportant. Have you heard the saying (a Chinese one, I believe): ""I was pointing at the stars but they were looking at my finger."" - interesting one, don't you find? You're missing the point guys.And now, on the comment (you distracted me, you) I'm a bit late I guess. Anyway this one will turn into a classic and it's never late to write about classics.I missed it when it was on at the theaters. When I came across this title a few months ago I was drawn by the Indian (I'm always fascinated by anything Indian) name of the director/writer but when I read the review on the back cover some doubts occurred due to the sci-fi hint as I'm not that much into the genre in general; I consider it neither science nor fiction. However the very first scene captured me and it was clear there was something about that movie; and when it was over I merely stood there in awe and I still do.Since I'm too hard to please (huge fan of such films as Terry Gilliam's, Antonioni's ""Blow-up"" - one of my all-time favorites and obviously one that ""Signs"" can be related to in a way, and a few more) I haven't seen a great (nor even a decent) movie for many years (except for some sparks like ""American Beauty"", ""Lost in Translation"" and stuff); and then it came.As I understand it (I've seen it twice) this is a work about truth being revealed step by step through ""signs of things and signs of signs"" as Umberto Eco put it in ""The Name of the Rose"". And one more quotation: ""A great work of art always reveals more than its author consciously intended to say. (Albert Camus, ""The Myth of Sisyphus""). So in my opinion what we deal with is an existential or metaphysical (why not call it) work about people seeking clearness about what they are surrounded with. Since humans tend to let themselves be carried by inertia one starts ""reading"" the signs mostly when they are forced to. Only under extreme circumstances one finds it necessary to think about ""important"" stuff. Ultimate situations require ultimate measures but ultimate measures definitely take ultimate thinking. But I believe works like this movie make us think from time to time even in the stream of everyday things. Last quotation (I promise): ""Wherever you look there is something to see.""

If the aliens can master space flight, turn their aircrafts invisible, wipe out an entire species and take over a planet, why can't they figure out how to open a wooden door. 2. The alien's weakness is water right? Then why would they land on a planet that is mostly made up of water? Wouldn't they also have shriveled up when they landed anyway considering there's water molecules in the air we breathe as well. 3. The boy who plays the son can't act for his life. 4. Why didn't the aliens bring any weapons with them? They can build aircrafts so they can probably make weapons as well. 5. The alien's design looks is very unoriginal.

Any director worth his merit would have thrown this horrendous script away with disgust. The screenplay is utter crap no matter from which angle you try to look at it. It's like polishing a dog-rocket in the hope people would by chance mistake it for a diamond; the smell will reveal the truth...I won't reiterate the gaping holes in the logic of this film so often mentioned on this forum.

But this doesn't make sense considering the creature has to have some intelligence. I mean they conquered space travel, so they cant be completely dumb. And any intelligent creature will first test the environment of a new planet by taking air samples, observing the weather etc and then act accordingly. But not these aliens. They just hop in and hope for the best. Ugh... If they had done some tests, they would find that even our AIR has water, and so breathing would be impossible. They would see it rains a deadly liquid and would equip themselves properly. But what we got were stark naked alien dummies with no protective clothing. So if it rains out, they're all doomed. A kid with a toy water pistol is a deadly weapon. Not to mention a couple firetrucks or a garden hose. Completely unbelievable. And now for the biggest plothole involving water. The aliens were running through cornfields at night. AT NIGHT! I don't care if you live in the dry Sahara desert, you run through a cornfield at night and you'll be soaked from head to foot in dew. Mistakes like this are unacceptable. And for the last stupid alien idea, like this movie needs another, is their weapon. Its the weakest thing I've ever seen. Its suppose to be a poison gas but they gave a sick child a direct hit and it did nothing. It trickles out of their wrist so slowly that in a slight breeze it would blow back in their face lol.

1806,schaaper2,A fascinating story of reconciliation and hope,10,30 April 2013,"M. Night Shyamalan delivers once again in a film that is sure not to disappoint anyone who enjoys scifi flicks. From it's amazing soundtrack to top notch acting, ""Signs"" keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what's going to happen next. As far as the plot is concerned,Shyamalan tells the story of an normal American family experiencing crisis on every side. The film documents the struggle of a family grieving the loss of a loved one while also dealing with a world falling apart around them. Although much attention is focused on how the family as a whole deals with grief and despair, the real story centers around Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Hess is confronted with a existential crisis of whether God really exists in the light of his wife's death. ""Signs"" uses the phenomena of crop circles and the threat of alien invasion as a metaphor for the truth that God really does have a plan in mind for humanity. Could all the evil and hurt in the world actually be used toward some future good? Shyamalan seems to think it could. The spiritual significance of this film is overwhelming. As a Christian, I view this film as a fascinating and deeply moving story of the questions that all of us ask in life. Could God actually be using the present evil we experience in life for good? I side with Shyamalan's conclusion. Just as suffering is a mandatory part of life on Earth, so to is the possibility of healing and hope. Of course, since I am a Christian, I see suffering as a result of man's decision to rebel against God. However, God has a plan! Just as sin brought about suffering and death to every person, so to God through Christ lived a life of suffering and experienced death without sinning, so that by believing in Christ's payment for sin we can experience reconciliation and hope ourselves. God has a plan! Please don't lose hope, find it in Christ.",Signs

I don't understand all the hype over this movie as the plot was weak and the acting was uninspired. After watching the movie, I wondered how aliens with super technology could not get through a locked basement door. It is baffling how aliens that could travel millions of light years in space could lose a war in one night to a planet,which in contrast to their own world, had to be primitive. Another flaw is in the fact that although water is a deadly toxin to them ,they decide it's a good idea to take over a planet that is 2/3 covered with water. If you were looking for a new world wouldn't you pick one that was 2/3 covered with arsenic? Smart huh? The last insult to my intelliegence occurs when an alien has abducted Rev. Hess's son and is about to kill him with poison gas. Rev. Hess's brother takes a baseball bat and beats the alien and the alien just stands there making grunting sounds. Once again I'm astounded by the sheer stupidity of this superior alien being. With the technology this species must have, where are the death rays and laser guns? I mean the EBE isn't even smart enough to run away when getting beat to a bloody pulp with a Louisville slugger.

1809,morning_dew,The most UNDERRATED movie of all times,7,7 May 2006,"This has got to be it. Every time I ask someone if they've seen it, they tell me how much they hate it, and how much ""it sucks"", and I seem to be the only one who likes it. It's such a beautifully written, directed and produced movie that it's even hard to find words to describe it. OK, yes, it's a movie about aliens, but I think most people fail to see what's really behind it... it's so much more deeper than that. I think people who dislike this movie are too nihilistic and narrow-minded to see what's really behind it. They go in thinking ""Ok, another alien movie"", without paying attention to the story behind it, or, on the contrary, they go in having great expectations and minding every single little detail and going crazy about plot holes, and stupid details that prevents that from seeing what this movie is REALLY about.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is an ex-reverend with two kids, who lost his wife Colleen in a car accident provoked by Ray Reddy (small appearance by M. Night Shyamalan himself). Graham is devastated and seems unable to get over the accident, blaming God for letting it happen and hence losing his faith in Him and religion, which notably affects his relationship with kids and brother Merril (Joaquin Phoenix). The whole movie deals about Graham's conflict dealing with this sudden and drastic change in his life, and the alien situation is just brought in to test Graham's faith again.The movie has an amazing cast, amazing performances by all of the people that's in it and it keeps you hooked for as long as it lasts. There's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't like it unless you watch it thinking it's just another alien movie, in which case, such prejudices will surely make you miss the deeper insight and meaning of the story. This movie is more than a movie about aliens. It's really a wonderful story about how a man who has lost his faith in life, in love and everything else gains it back, and anyone who doesn't like it, it's because they failed to understand the concept behind it. I believe this movie is a masterpiece I strongly recommend, and I suggest to all of those who have seen it and didn't like it that they watch it again, but this time paying attention to the details and not being shallow enough that they are blinded by the ""crappy alien concept"" without grasping the lesson behind it, so they understand the real meaning of one of the most beautiful, well-written but sadly underrated movies of all time.",Signs

Just because aliens are involved, coming from space? That's kinda weak explanation from a sci-fi fan. You can't judge Spartacus upon the base it's a comedy. Taken as a comedy it's a bad comedy, because it's not funny. The same way Signs is of course a bad sci-fi, because it's isn't sci-fi at all... And it was not even intended to be sci-fi. So it's a fantasy/horror movie with some drama, as it is with all Shyamalan movies, you should have noticed that by now. A very likable fantasy/horror movie with much suspense and atmosphere, and also with a feel for drama and for actual human psychological themes. But it's all metaphoric, and of course, if you don't like or don't get metaphors, obviously this movie isn't for you.",Signs

He appears defenseless as the movie starts and, while he and his family are under severe but subtle attack as the story progresses, the family's strength is entirely based on a reliance on each other and on an unspoken yet unrelenting faith in each other. The Director has shown in this and his other movies that are clearly a product of his vivid and poetic imagination that the theme of the movies he makes, much like the movies prominent New York directors make, are set in the same locale, here Pennsylvania, but always about spiritual and transcendent topics. In ""The Sixth Sense"" it was a universal and eternal love, while here it is faith under attack and a strength in those we care most about. Outside events, deaths, abandonments, and seeming isolation can destroy faith but the individual can choose in the final analysis to look for faith, to seek faith, and to find it in the searching. Mr. Gibson's character finds what faith he thought had abandoned him and he finds it closer than he ever imagined it. This movie is excellent in following the Gibson character's pilgrimage to a new and stronger belief in himself, in his family and in his faith.",Signs
1812,katherinemdolan,"By the Morons, for the Morons,",1,5 February 2005,"Signs is the worst science-fiction film ever made. Its alien-invasion story is so idiotic it makes Independence Day look clever, and the cinematography is as dull as the plot is stupid. There must be at least an hour of closeups of Mel Gibson's slack, basset-hound face looking nervous but steadfast. Poor Mel needn't have worried so much, because the aliens menacing his farmhouse are so helpless they literally can't figure out how to break down a boarded-up door. Their plan to conquer earth is simple: they plan to wipe us out by breaking and entering our humble abodes and fighting it out with us in unarmed combat. That's right: these advanced interstellar travelers can't come up with any better way of wiping out six billion people by breaking into each and every house on the planet and attacking us with their bare hands, or paws. That's right: they don't have any weapons at all. Yes, folks, these critters can cross the galaxy, but they don't have enough sense to bring a weapon when they attack, not even a tire iron. So when the aliens decide to make Mel's little farmhouse their first strategic objective, their battle plan is simple: a single alien skulks around the living room, totally unarmed, trying to look menacing. This makes the interstellar burglar an easy victim for Mel's little brotherJoaquin Phoenix--an ex-baseball player who's lost his batting average, just like big brother Mel has lost his faith. defeats the alien in the farmhouse living room by getting the IL' Lousiville Slugger off the wall and hitting a home run right off the extraterrestrial's ribcage. Oh, wait, I forgot: the bat just softens up the evil alien, knocking him to the floor where he's finished off by...a spilled glass of water. It seems these technologically advanced ETs failed to note, in their decades of recon, that 2/3s of Earth happens to be covered with water. It's a good thing Phoenix mugged the poor fool; otherwise that first alien picnic at the beach would have been a real bummer. Signs may be a collections of dismal clichés, but it is original in at least two ways: not only are its alien invaders the first to arrive without any weapons, but they're also the first in film history to be baffled by simple wooden doors. First Mel's neighbor locks an alien scout in the pantry, where it scuffles around helplessly. Then the bigger invasion force lands, advances on Mel's farmhouse, and withdraws without managing to get in. What clever tactic has baffled them, you ask? The answer will surprise you: Mel and family have boarded up the doors. Boarded-up doors, a baseball bat, and a spilled glass of water: that's all it takes to foil an interstellar invasion. The really interesting question is why this movie makes its space invaders so comically helpless. Do American audience just need to imagine an enemy they could actually handle, after all the grim news out of Iraq--or are the film's director, star and millions of adoring fans just plain stupid?John Dolan",Signs
1813,thatgirl1969,Most people seem to have actually missed the point,9,16 November 2006,"After reading at least 3 pages of reviews saying how awful ""Signs"" is, I really felt I needed to clarify the actual POINT of this movie. Look at the name of the movie. If you have any concept, or belief, in 'signs', karma, kismit, coincidences - or whatever terminology works for you - then you'll overlook the inconsistencies and appreciate the movie for what it was meant to be. This is, quite simply, a movie that tries to offer an alternative view of what so many people think of as simply random occurrences, a lucky break, divine intervention, or as I said earlier, coincidences - all those 'little things' in life that when they happen, seem to happen for no reason.. until all the pieces of the jigsaw come together in that one moment, and everything you THOUGHT was just a coincidence is explained. If you're a believer in ""everything happens for a reason"", then you'll appreciate ""Signs"". If you're not that type of person, then you'll do what many others have done, and look for the inconsistencies (of which, I admit, there are many in ""Signs""). Watch this movie and appreciate it for the story BEHIND it, and you'll enjoy it. Watch it expecting the best alien invasion movie ever invented, and not only will you be disappointed, but you'll miss the whole point of the story. Overall, a brilliant movie for those that like to believe that everything in life happens for a reason. Not such a good movie for the skeptics. Enough said.",Signs

It goes on about the title being stupid because if aliens could find their way to earth from a distant planet then they would be able to find their way around our home planet. Summed up in a couple of words this is sheer Cr*p. We can see bodies such as Mars and Venus through telescopes. But we needed to send robots, satellites etc. to scale the terrain.

1818,gchilder,"Hold on to your seat, this is going to be quite a ride.",9,21 March 2005,"""Signs"" is an intense film that grabs you at the very beginning with an insight into a world beyond what any audience believes is the only possible world. M. Knight Shyamalan has set out to intrigue the viewer with his display of alien crop circles and their possible use for navigational purposes. This idea seems to be based solely on Shyamalan's perceived knowledge of life beyond this realm. Shyamalan sets the mood of the film during the opening credits with the type of eerie music that you might find in an Alfred Hitchcock movie. The music is continued throughout the film and lets the audience know to hold on to their seats, this is going to be quite a ride.The movie ""Signs"" stars Mel Gibson as Father Graham Hess who lives with his family on a remote farm in Bucks County, PA. This closely-knit family consists of two children Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin) and Father Hess's brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). The children's mother died six months earlier in a car accident and Merrill moved to the farm shortly after her death to help his grieving brother and his family. ""Signs"" shows that even a religious person can suffer the loss of faith when life's direction is challenged by a higher power.The first half of the film focuses on the children who seem to have more insight into things beyond what the adults can comprehend or will even allow themselves to believe. Short of a miracle, the world seems doomed. News reports from all of the news agencies were appearing on the Hess family's television. The reports were plastered with the same images from around the world. When asked what was on television, Breslin answers in an eerie monotone voice, ""it's the same on every station"". Eventually the television was hidden from the children in a closet and only Phoenix was viewing these reports. Shyamalan uses these newscasts as their only link to the outside world. The everyday life on the farm is filled with signs. The half-filled water glasses that Breslin leaves around the house even has a purpose in this film. We can see daily how the family grows closer. Shyamalan accomplishes this in the film as the family gathers around the television to watch these reports. The family who started out on opposite ends of the farm at the beginning of the film are now huddling together in fear of the signs around them.Gibson's character struggles with his need to regain his faith in God and his own ability to help his family to get through this terrible situation. Something appears to be watching them. Is it God or something else? The signs are all there. Shyamalan allows us to catch glimpses of the aliens in the fields and on the roof top. The film seems to carry out its sign motif even further with delightful ornate woodcarvings and images in every scene in the film.The entire film seems to come together because everyone all over the world is seeking answers to God's purpose for this alien invasion. The conclusion is that they will have to seek out God themselves for the answers. The family that has been isolated from the outside world draws strength from the Gibson character. In the end of the film, Gibson's faith returns and the overall knowledge that the world as well as their home is once again saved by God's endearing love.The work of Shyamalan in a more recent film shows a group of citizens of a small town in ""The Village"" who are struggling with their own beliefs of the outside world and what is happening beyond the walls that were protecting them. Both ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" explore the possibility of the world having forgotten them and how the characters in both are left to fend for themselves.The fact that ""Signs"" is an awesome thriller is well known to those of us who viewed the film at its opening in 2002 and are still on the edge of our seats as we watch it again today on DVD. This is truly a film that will open your eyes to the possibilities of another realm and what might be possible beyond this world. The questioning of anyone's faith will certainly be a hot topic of discussion after viewing Signs. Watch this film with someone who appreciates a good thriller, it will be a fun and fantastic film to talk about long after the film ends and the popcorn has disappeared.",Signs

1822,jayrandolph9,'The Sixth Sense' turned into a religious film with aliens...,4,4 January 2015,"Several of my friends have recommended this movie to me over the years, telling me it is an engaging psychological thriller and one of the scariest movies they had ever seen. I finally found a copy of 'Signs' in a thrift shop and decided to check it out for myself. I waited until it turned dark, turned out all the lights, and settling in for a thrilling adventure...The story immediately introduces the audience to eerie and mysterious crop circles in Graham's (Mel Gibson) corn field, where he finds his kids walking around (in a typical children-who- casually-say-something-creepy-to-their-worried-parent fashion) after waking up. The plot then delves into the realms of extra-terrestrial life from the viewpoint of an average family (by average I mean average on-screen family, where there is a young boy, younger girl, single parent (with a deceased spouse), and some other family member who has come to live with them) who live in a small, rural town in their old farmhouse. Many reviewers see 'Signs' favorably because of its attention to the realistic aspect of a hypothetical alien invasion, focusing on just your average family and how they see what is going on in the outside world. However, Shyamalan goes too far in this regard, using sometimes extremely cheesy dialogue and several awkwardly written scenes to stress this family's averageness.I won't go any further into the plot, and anyway I feel like there is nowhere else to go. Throughout the movie, the dialogue felt extremely forced and it sometimes felt more like I was reading a screenplay off a piece of paper than watching a film. I was expecting much more depth and character development going into this Shyamalan movie, especially after watching 'The Sixth Sense.' However, I was highly disappointed, as the film felt like a failed attempt at incorporating the psychological elements and suspense of 'The Sixth Sense' into an extra-terrestrial thriller/horror film (I mean really, Mel Gibson even begins to look like Bruce Willis after a while). I gave it a 4/10 because the directing and cinematography is decent (I enjoy Shyamalan's style), but the screenplay is extremely sub-par. The premise of 'Signs' isn't half bad, but it would have made a much better short film than full-length feature. The acting and directing is fine, but the film felt hollow, with a solid shell and nothing to fill it. In addition, there was an unexpected and completely unnecessary religious element added to the film (I won't go into detail to avoid accidentally giving out spoilers) that completely changed the general feel of the movie from a psychological, extraterrestrial thriller to that of a religious flick, in my mind.If you're looking for a psychological thriller, sci-fi, or horror film that will keep you as engaged as 'The Sixth Sense' and leave you staring at the screen, this movie isn't for you. Just watch the 'The Sixth Sense' again. However, if you enjoy Shyamalan's style and want to see his take on an extraterrestrial thriller, you may enjoy 'Signs.' Just don't expect to leave the movie in awe or have any nightmares about it (you're more likely to have nightmares about the screenplay than the actual aliens in the film).(I'm not even going to get into the plot holes, just read the other reviews...)",Signs

1824,koinonia_pneumatos,An invasion backdrop for an excellent faith story.,9,31 May 2005,"SPOILERS AHEAD!Some people believe that this film falls apart towards the end. I don't believe that. In fact, I think the ending is its strongest point, but you have to be tracking with Shayamalan the whole time. The movie isn't about aliens. Not really, at least. It's about faith. It's about family.Mel Gibson's character, Graham, has lost his faith. And it is that part of his character around which the entire movie revolves. We are constantly reminded that he was once a minister, and he constantly reminds us that he doesn't want to be associated with it anymore. We learn about his wife's death and how that has changed his life and his family dynamic. He's very angry with God.Once one understands that, the rest of the movie is quite excellent and falls right into place. By the end, Graham is confronted with the complex ways that God has been guiding his life. The ending doesn't fall apart. It draws everything together at the central point of the real story of the movie: a man who is angry with God about how his life has played out.As a Christian, I readily admit my slight bias towards stories like this. However, if you strip my faith out of my view of the film it still completely works and is still a well crafted story and film on both technical levels, and storytelling levels. Whether or not you agree with the story or its possible message, that doesn't change the fact that it is a story that hits its marks and is told well.",Signs
1825,jagheteraxelberntsson,Signs is a moody masterpiece,9,18 February 2015,"When it comes to M Night Shyamalan movies, they are often heavily criticized for being too absurd. And the critics may have a point when it comes to some of the movies, which holds a very low class. But in this case, the critics are absolutely wrong. I can honestly say that ""Signs"" is one of the greatest Sci-fi movies ever created. The story centers on Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). A former priest whose faith in god has been shattered after his wife died in an accident with a drunk driver. After the accident, his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) moves into the farmhouse where Graham and his two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), live. Months pass and few things happen that are out of the ordinary until Graham discovers an enormous crop circle in his field. Instantly, Graham and Merrill wonders which gang that may have come around to make a big prank but after they see breaking news about crop circles all over the world, they begin to expect an extra-terrestrial interference. This is the plot of the movie, and just reading it can make you anticipate that it is going to be a very exciting film. And it sure is. ""Signs"" really shook me and made me discover a whole new kind of suspense. To create a movie that is tense for 106 minutes, you are going to need class actors. And in this case, M Night Shyamalan, does not disappoint. Mel Gibson, two times Oscar winner, is perfect for the role of Graham Hess, and Joaquin Phoenix delivers both tears, hoorays and a couple of laughs. Even the child actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, are very talented and play their rolls in the best way possible. Do this movie have any flaws or plot holes that may lower the rating? Absolutely. There is a plot hole in the movie which makes viewers want to give it a low grade, and even some flaws that excludes the movie from being one of the smartest ever directed. But people have to remember something; M Night Shyamalan does not aim for being the cleverest director with the smartest plots. He aims for something else that is called sheer suspense, and in that field, he is one of the greats. If you want a film that will knock you over, maybe not in the level of intelligence, but in the level of suspense, look no further. Do yourself a favor and buy a big bag of crisps, sit down in the sofa and watch ""Signs"" and you won't regret it for a single minute.

Shyamalan pulled the movie off well. Some things could have been fixed like the odds that Graham found his daughter that quickly in such a massive and dense crop field at the movies beginning. And some of the acting by the children seemed at some times like the acting you would expect in a Kraft Macaroni and Cheese commercial.Besides that the movie was pulled of excellently with some very interesting moments as well as some sudden movements and scares.

There are two major things about this movie that make it completely awful, and it makes me think that he was too rushed or lazy when making this film.-- The deadpan acting. I don't know if MNS was trying to go for deer-in-headlight shock, or the heavy burden of the situation, but Mel Gibson and his entire family were completely unemotional about *anything*. After listening to their monotonic drone for thirty minutes, I was completely bored.-- The aliens. These guys are smart enough to accomplish interstellar travel, yet they've been plotting for a long time to take over a planet that's 70% covered with a substance that's toxic to them (I don't know... maybe they were looking for a source for WMDs), and they can't figure out a way to break down a wooden door with a weapon, explosives, or at least an improvised battering ram.... hoooo-kay!",Signs
1828,PeanutGalleryReject,Very overrated and stupid,3,2 March 2016,"This movie is really bad. Nothing makes sense, the people make stupid decisions, and the aliens are absolutely brainless. The child actors, while they can cry on screen, are terrible. Any time they're not crying is atrocious. At one point, something pretty scarring happens to the children, and there is NO EMOTION. Given context, you would agree with me in saying that the kids should AT LEAST act a LITTLE shocked. And then there's the camera-work. The camera-work for the most part is alright, but those shots where the camera swoops across during a conversation or something mundane drives me crazy. There's nothing in this movie that you can't find anywhere else. The aliens look generic, the setting is cliché, and most importantly, the main twist makes NO SENSE. I'm not going to spoil it here, but it is literally the most BACKWARDS THING you could imagine. Like once you see it you'll be wanting to beat up M. Night Shyamalan. I honestly don't see why so many people like this movie. The only redeeming qualities are Mel Gibson's and Joaquin Phoenix's performances, those are actually pretty good. But other than that, there's next to nothing good here. I mean, some of the camera-work is alright (aside from the aforementioned swooping thing,) but sometimes alright camera-work doesn't make a good movie.

This makes you question why would they take the risk and come here? Why come to a planet that will kill you? The purpose of the alien visit is not very clear, maybe they were desperate, maybe there home planet was torn apart by some civil war? In fact you won't think about any of these questions during the movie. The movie has so much thrill it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Few movies manage to get a grip on you. The build up of the events is very suspenseful. The first time I watched it I was a kid and I got scared in some scenes. As I watched it again as an adult I felt the thrill in some scenes.

Durring the final, climactic scene something so completely retarded occurred that I was ripped out of the contented haze the movie had lulled me into. I was shocked.

I love Sci-fi films but this one make me Turn Into Sleep and use my remote to fast forward several times to bypass those boring plot. This movie was not scary at all. There were maybe 1 scenes that were actually scary, and the only reason I was then was because of a quiet scene suddenly interrupted by a loud sound(by that Crazy Dog dog at beginning). I want my weekend back! Don't SEE IT!!Don't SEE IT!!Don't SEE IT!!Don't SEE IT!! Don't SEE IT!!Don't SEE IT!!Don't SEE IT!!Don't SEE IT!! Don't SEE IT!!Don't SEE IT!!Don't SEE IT!!Don't SEE IT!!",Signs
1838,stinerknudsen,Whats up with the aliens!?!,6,17 April 2006,"Hello everybody! In the sense of a thriller the film was actually good; I was shaking a lot through this movie. But I just really hated the point in it! We have to imagine that the aliens went back into outer space, cause the film only showed that the aliens were afraid of water! The actual point with this film was that the father began to believe again... So whats with the aliens!?! If they were just there to fill out some of the time, well... then I think this film could just as good have been without the aliens! Whats the point of making people believe that this film is about aliens, if it was only about the father believing again! But I think that there were a lot of very good comments in this movie! Especially from the father! And some good facts about aliens, too! Cheer up! In the big sense this movie was actually good enough! :-)",Signs
1839,two_cents,Stupidity is it's own reward,3,30 December 2005,"Or so it seems.How Mr Night Shyamalan got away with insulting our intelligence in this way is beyond me. But he did, and he is handsomely rewarded with a rating of seven, four points more than this film deserves.Signs attempts to mix science fiction with religious motifs, and fails miserably. The first half hour of the film is bearable as you can still maintain the illusion that it will actually lead somewhere. After that it rapidly goes downhill and becomes unwatchable for anyone with even a remote understanding of either physics, biology, combat or navigation. I've watched many bad films, but this one made me feel so violated that I had to write my very first review.To be fair, this film isn't a total loss. It is worth watching if you are very religious, preferably the Gibson variety, and neither logic nor common sense interest you.For all others: stay clear of this film or you will feel cheated afterward.",Signs
1840,altafhajiyani,a film to keeps u on the edge of the seat.,4,7 February 2006,"starts with the point for which the film was made 'signs' on the field, dogs barking, actors confused,you know it was done by aliens but the director makes u if or if not.news reporting series of similar events in other parts of the world .the film succeeds in keeping u on the edge and scares u in certain parts but no signs of the so called alien till the last frame.as always in his films the background score is fantastic.performances are okay and the screenplay is good.by seeing this film u are forced to think which one was better sixth sense or signs .for me sixth sense was a gem in its content but signs was better in the technique.anyway it is my opinion.a must see for all m. night shyamalan fans.",Signs
1841,silasmaigaard,M. Night Shaymalan and Signs misunderstood.,10,14 February 2006,"I've heard many people saying, that they were disappointed after seeing ""Signs"". The reason why they get disappointed seems to be, that they expect a horror movie when they go to the cinema to see a M. Night Shaymalan movie. That's a mistake, in my point of view. M. Night combines superstition, beliefs, and everyday conflicts in his movie. The last one may seem a little odd, considering the plot in ""Signs"". But the truth is, that the film is far more than just another horror movie. It's a reflection of the human mind, faith and weakness.Expect a dramatic, sad, frightening and exceptional touching film. It will make you wonder if it could actually be authentic. But remember: It's no horror movie!Enjoy!",Signs
1842,erinlconner,I think a lot of people are missing the point...,8,5 November 2018,"I'm amazed at all the bad reviews for this movie. After reading a lot of them, I've come to the conclusion that there are three types of people that will not like this movie. If you recognize yourself in one of these categories then don't watch this movie. It's not for you.Firstly, there's the ""I'm looking for a bloody/standard science-fiction alien invasion movie"" person, then the ""I'm offended at anything religious"" person, and finally the movie snob type.To the first group: The point of this movie is not the aliens. In all the reviews I read I found only ONE person who seemed to actually understand this. The aliens story-line is just a vehicle for the actual point. This story is about a man struggling with overwhelming grief and finding his way back to himself and what's left of his family. It doesn't matter whether or not the aliens look ""cheesey."" They weren't that bad anyway.The second group: These were the most frustrating reviews to read. The religious undertones don't make this a bad movie. Calm down. All some reviewers can talk about is the ""sermon"" of this movie. One reviewer talked about how no one would need what he called ""divine wisdom"" to hit the alien with a bat in defense of his nephew. The message the movie was trying to convey here (that seemed to go miles over the reviewer's head) is that there was a REASON Merrill was so strong. Obviously no one needs to be told to ""hit an intruder with a piece of wood."" I suppose not everyone is good at interpretation although I think this was fairly obvious. I'm sorry the idea of faith disturbs so many people but just because a movie doesn't line up with your beliefs is no reason to call it bad. The point of the climax of the movie is to make you think not necessarily to make you agree.To the third group: Some of your complaints are actually valid. Good for you. Yes, it was silly that aliens can travel possibly millions of light-years but can't break down a door. I'm with you. The fact that they can pick up communication on the baby monitor but an army designed and operated radar can't detect anything? Yes I'm with you again. Things like this are why I took off stars. However, there are a few complaints I'd like to comment on.Some people mentioned that the movie left them with too many questions. They were disappointed that we only saw what happened to this family and never got to see the rest of the world. I feel this is one of the best aspects of the film. The film concentrated on this family because, say it with me, THAT WAS THE POINT. The invasion is not the real focus here (refer to group one above). I really enjoyed the limited focus. It made you feel like you were there with them instead of just an observer.Some people complained about the ""deadpan acting."" This fits with the story-line. For many grieving people going through life almost mechanically is all they can manage. Mel Gibson actually does some great work when he, very realistically, has to hold back obvious emotion when he speaks to his children.Another common complaint was about water being what ultimately saves humanity. There were two kinds of complaints about this. The first was basically along the lines of ""that's lame."" Refer to group one.
The other kind was something like ""why would they invade a planet that was mostly water?"" This one has some grounds. I understand where these complaints are coming from. However, I think that the limited perspective is the culprit here. We don't really know much about these aliens. In fact, we know next to nothing. We are only seeing them from the perspective of this family. There could be any number of reasons why the water specifically on Earth harmed them. Or perhaps they had no plans to stay long term and therefore were not concerned about the water. Maybe they were just arrogant. Be open minded. There could be any number of reasons why they would have made that risk. Remember the limited perspective that was supposed to tighten our focus to what was actually the point of the movie. It's a story-telling device. Intentional. This kind of story doesn't have to explain everything. That's the nature of this kind of writing. It leaves you with questions. It's thought-provoking. It's supposed to make you think. It's another aspect of this movie I really enjoyed.Like most of Shyamalan's movies, his purpose is to convey a deeper message through symbolism. That's not for everyone. Some people just want to watch popcorn flicks with aliens getting there heads chopped off with no message or any ideas that could conflict with their own and nothing to make them think. That's fine. This movie is just not for you.However, this is very far from a bad movie. I've seen a lot of bad movies and this doesn't even come close. Does it have problems? Yes. Definitely worth watching though. If you can be open minded.",Signs
1843,tfeinman,Preposterous!,1,16 March 2006,"Aliens who are able to travel through interstellar space who could use some type of electronic beacon or global mapping system beacons, rely on carving patterns into grass instead! The star-traveling aliens have no advanced weaponry such as neutron bombs or viruses, and must instead rely on hand-to-hand combat to subdue earthlings! Incredibly, the aliens choose Earth -a water planet to colonize/subdue, but the aliens are unable to deal with water, which is apparently toxic to them! Whoops! Big strategic planning error for the aliens. Yeah, right! The mood evoked by Shyamalan was spooky and oppressive, so I give him credit for that, but the plot problems really interfered with my enjoyment of this film.",Signs
1844,natcawithalex,Are aliens not logical?,1,20 March 2006,"The biggest problem that I had against this movie was the logic. Why would aliens attack a planet that precipitates water and is 75% covered in water if they are allergic to water? Personally, I think that if they are supposed to be far more sophisticated than us, they wouldn't come near our planet.The other biggest problem that I had with Signs is the fact that scientists believe that no life can live without water, so according to that theory, these aliens shouldn't even exist.In my opinion, the writers should have thought of something else that would kill the aliens off... maybe some other common household item.",Signs
1845,annie830508,why we are always unaware of things,8,24 March 2006,"This movie does make me think about such a question----why we are always not aware of the important signs that others had sent to us. I mean sometimes i think about the basic senses of human beings. We are not that sensitive to some natural signals such as earthquake or flood, while cats and dogs may be much more aware. To those everyday signs that our lovers our friends try to send us, we seem to be less and less sensitive either. We turn a blind eye on most of the details that do count. What hints does she want to give me in that deep look at me before i go to work this morning? We seldom ask ourselves these questions which may bring us closer. In this point of view this is an excellent movie and an excellent sign as well.",Signs
