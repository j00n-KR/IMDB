0,MartinHafer,Did these reviewers see the same film I did?!,9,22 October 2019,"While I am not a huge fan of horror, I was very impressed by ""The Lodge"". It was very intelligently written and never lost my interest. Oddly, the other reviews currently on IMDB really hated it....and I am not sure why.The story finds a couple children being drug to a cabin in the freezing wilderness for the Christmas holiday. I say 'drug' because this trip will include Dad's new girlfriend....and the kids blame her for their parents' failed marriage. Much of the trip, the girlfriend will watch the kids as the father has to work and will be going back to the city for a few days. In the meantime, the weather and other factors conspire to make the prospective step-mother lose her mind! Can the kids manage to survive? There is much more to the story than this...many twists and interesting story elements (such as the lady having belonged to a suicide cult as a child)....but if I tell more it might ruin the suspense.The bottom line is that the film was usually difficult to predict AND the motivations for the breakdown were interesting. This is not a slasher film but a more intelligent psychological thriller....well worth seeing and very unsettling.",The Lodge
1,SnoopyStyle,opens with a bang,5,5 June 2020,"Laura Hall is separated from her husband who plans to remarry. She kills herself with a shot to the head. Her kids (Jaeden Martell, Lia McHugh) are devastated. They find some disturbing material in their father's computer. He (Richard Armitage) brings the kid and his new wife Grace Marshall (Riley Keough) to a remote lodge.The movie starts with a literal bang. It's a visual explosion and then it bumps along at a slow roll. It's trying to be a moody atmospheric horror but that explosion leaves a ringing in the ears. It's hard to hear a soft melody after one almost loses one's hearing to start the song. There has been a few of these smaller artistic horrors recently. There is some interesting aspects to this attempt although it never truly achieve terrific traction.",The Lodge
2,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Films I Have Recently Seen,7,10 May 2020,"""The Lodge"" is one of the best films I have recently seen. It is impossible to write a synopsis without spoiler since the movie has many plot points. The story and the mystery are engaging and the viewer does not know what is happening to Grace and the kids. This a psychological horror film and the conclusion is perfect for the situation. I believed Richard Armitage was Hugh Jackman, my mistake. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available",The Lodge
3,nogodnomasters,REPENT!,6,5 May 2020,"PLOT SPOILERS:
Richard (Richard Armitage) wants to divorce Laura (Alicia Silverstone) for Grace (Riley Keough). They have been separated for a while. Grace was the daughter of a suicide cult and the lone survivor. When Laura does herself in, the kids blame Grace. Dad forces them together with Grace over the wintry Christmas as a remote lodge. Grace takes meds. One morning they wake up and the Grinch had come to visit and took everything. They quickly figure out (Plot Spoiler) they are in a bad remake of a Nicole Kidman film.Riley Keough was a lame character. It was hard to imagine Richard leaving his wife for someone so maladjusted to life. And what was with the dollhouse reflecting real life? It was interesting but how did it fit in with Grace's past? It appears they tried to cram too much into the film. Sometimes less is more.Guide: F-word. Nudity (Riley Keough)",The Lodge
4,kosmasp,In the know,9,6 February 2020,"Even to know, does not mean you know, you know? It does make sense believe, as does the story. And again, it is about the story and where it leads. Now hopefully no one has told you anything or you haven't read too much about it. But even if you have hints (or figure stuff out as the movie progresses), it won't spoil the ""fun"" of watching the movie.Because the backbone of it all is strong enough. And the performances are quite something too. Of course there are ""duh!"" moments and things done by main characters which you might think as not clever ... but then again you need these moments to move stories along. And they are not too far stretched or not to the breaking point (imho). Sit back and enjoy this slow burner - it is rewarding",The Lodge
5,classicsoncall,"""You know how to open the door.""",6,29 March 2021,"The movie plays out more like a psychological thriller than a horror film, as the horror implied has more to do with Grace Marshall's (Riley Keough) nightmares and the revenge plan concocted by siblings Aiden (Jaeden Martell) and Mia (Lia McHugh) Hall. That revenge plan butts up against the guilt Grace perceives over the marital breakup between their father (Richard Armitage) and mother (Alicia Silverstone), and the mom's subsequent suicide. I have to say, the scene in which Laura Hall kills herself happened so quickly that one doesn't have time to prepare for it as the viewer. If you wanted to point to a jump scare in the picture, that would probably be the first and only one because it was very effectively done. The nagging question one is forced to focus on was why in the world Richard would have fallen into a relationship with the sole survivor of a suicide cult that left thirty eight people dead. You would have to know that there would remain lingering effects of such a horrific event that it would eventually stain the relationship, and in this case it led to utter destruction. I have my doubts whether a teenage boy and his younger sister could come up with such an elaborate plan as they did to drive their future mom crazy; the phony newspaper story showing they all died due to a faulty gas heater was icing on the cake. Had they known it would have ended in a finale where they had to repent for their sins, I think they might have been more accepting of their father's fiancée.",The Lodge
6,michaelRokeefe,A slow twisting thriller,8,11 May 2020,"If you are already moderately depressed, this may not be the movie for you. But if you care to see a sleeper that has potential to break out; enter the LODGE. After a business man's wife's suicide his two children are deeply saddened. He wants them to accept his new fiance, Grace, (Riley Keough), and they end up secluded with the pretty young woman at the family's remote lodge. As their relationship starts to warm, they are snowed in and Grace's personal psychological demons begin to haunt them all. This move keeps getting darker with a tricky twist before a non-guessable finale. Atmospheric being snowbound and some eerie original background music from Danny Bensi and Saunders Juriraans.Riley Keough is worthy of carrying this movie. (By the way, if you didn't already know, she is the granddaughter of Elvis Presley.) Also featured are Jaeden Martell, Lia McHugh, Richard Armitage and Alicia Silverstone.",The Lodge

8,george.schmidt,Keough gives blood however the film not so much,7,6 July 2020,"THE LODGE (2019) **1/2 Riley Keough, Jaeden Martell, , Lia McHugh, Richard Armitage, Alicia Silverstone, Danny Keough. Atmospheric psychological horror flick with Keough as the survivor of a cult about to become a stepmother who vacations with her impending children in a secluded cabin in the woods when things begin to twist and turn much to her detriment. While filmmakers Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz (who co-scripted with Severin Fiala) manage to supply some feeling of true dread the buildup ultimately is somewhat a disappointment. Keough gives blood in her performance of a woman slowly unhinging and the gorgeously foreboding cinematography by Thimios Bakatakis underscores the fears she experiences. Sure it's wonderful to see THE THING referenced but it is always a slippery slope whenever a film nods overbearingly so to a vastly superior film; nice try.",The Lodge
9,ferguson-6,most of the pieces,6,13 February 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Should you ever get cast as the stepmother in a horror movie, just know things aren't likely to go well for your character. That even holds true for the stepmom-to-be in this latest from the writer-director team of Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz who delivered GOODNIGHT MOMMY (2014). Their script comes from an idea by writer Sergio Casci, and it starts with a bang!Richard (Richard Armitage) has planned a Christmas holiday trip to an isolated cabin in the woods so his two kids can get to know his fiancé Grace. Of course, his kids blame Grace for the break-up of their family, and the subsequent tragedy that befalls their mother. Aidan (Jaeden Martell, IT) and Mia (Lia McHugh) take advantage of Google to discover that Grace is the sole survivor of a cult's mass suicide (similar to Marshall Applewhite's Heaven's Gate). As if that's not enough, Richard gets called back to the city for work (what??) and then a massive snow storm hits the cabin just after the power and water are cut-off. Finally, Grace's meds for sanity disappear, along with most of the clothes.So we have a snow-covered cabin deep in the woods with two kids stranded with a quasi-stepmom that they don't like. And yes, there's a cute pet dog. We also have more religious images and ornamentation than anyone who is not the Pope should have in their home. On top of everything, there is a large dollhouse that often factors in to what we see on screen and to what the kids and Grace are going through. And it's Christmas! In other words, there is no shortage of elements necessary for a quality horror film.I much prefer creepy over slasher for horror films, and this one easily meets that standard. Rather than a slow burn, it's a slow freeze. Unfortunately, the actions of the characters and the script just didn't work for me. The tormenting that goes on was not believable, and I just never could get over the fact that dad left these people who didn't even know each other, together in the middle of nowhere while he went back to work. As a rule of thumb (or red flag), when a character expresses their theory about unexplained occurrences in a horror movie, you can be fairly certain that the theory is incorrect, or at least misleading, even if it's what you were already thinking.On the bright side, Riley Keough (daughter of Elvis Presley's daughter) gives a terrific performance as Grace. She is very effective in keeping us guessing as to her true colors - is she a creepy monster or is she being victimized? Also, the film has a very stylish look. The cinematographer is Thimios Bakatakis (THE LOBSTER), and the cabin and nature setting give him plenty to work with. Other bright spots include a very brief appearance from Alicia Silverstone, and the opening credits logo of the resurrected Hammer Films (a favorite of monster movie fans). I caught this at the inaugural North Texas Film Festival in 2019, and it will surely strike a chord with some horror movie lovers ... even though it left me out in the cold.",The Lodge
10,trashgang,100% hammer,7,29 May 2020,"A lot of boring statements about this flick and I can understand it. It is slow and it is confusing and there aren't really any scary parts but it's so typical late Hammer that only Hammer geeks will love this.No blood (almost), no jumpmoments but what it does offer is a creepy atmosphere with excellent cinematography. The sound adds towards the sphere throughout this flick and the acting is sublime too espescially by the brother and sister but in favt, the 3 main leads do offer excellent acting.If you don't like horror with the Gothic overflow or don't like slow movies then you bettter forget it. I admit, sometimes I even thought, okay, let's move forward but it all adds to the story.

11,deloudelouvain,Easy entertainment.,7,25 September 2020,"I would probably have enjoyed the movie more if I didn't see the twist coming so soon, it kinda ruined the surprise for me, but then again we always try to figure out what's going on and sometimes we're right, sometimes we're wrong. In this case I was right just a bit too early. But it's still an entertaining movie to watch, for this genre of thriller/mystery. The acting wasn't bad either and that from the whole ""small"" cast. The cinematography was better than I expected it would be, the pace of the story a bit slow but it added to the dark ambiance of The Lodge. Not a masterpiece but not a bad movie either, worth a watch.",The Lodge
12,FeastMode,wow... well done,7,6 July 2020,"Well-made movie all around. Great story that kept me intrigued and affected me. It's not very scary, more creepy and uneasy. When i found out it was directed by the same duo that made goodnight mommy, i said ""OF COURSE IT WAS THEM."" this movie actually made me think about goodnight mommy before i found that out. Two movies. Two eights. Well done. I think i like goodnight mommy better but we shall see.On second viewing, i found it pretty slow. I was debating dropping it to a 7, but my initial impression is more important, and in the end i was just as impacted. (2 viewings, 7/5/2020, 10/16/2021)",The Lodge
13,dromasca,"white around, dark inside",7,19 January 2020,"The story of 'The Lodge' takes place around Christmas, but I do not expect this movie to appear too soon on the television programs during the winter holidays. The film is written and directed by the Austrians Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz who have in their filmography only one more feature film, belonging to the same genre (I haven't seen that movie yet). Now they crossed the ocean and made their debut there with 'The Lodge', one of the most effective and therefore the most frightening horror films that I have seen lately. Even more. While holiday movies on television tend to be feel-good films, 'The Lodge' is conceived in many ways as a feel-bad movie. Feel Very Bad!Chalets isolated in the mountains whose connection with the world is cut by heavy snow storms and whose inhabitants have to face nature, their loneliness or each other are a familiar setting for many films of the genre. The script of 'The Lodge' written by the two directors together with Sergio Casci brings in the lodge two children orphaned of their mother in tragic circumstances, and Grace (Riley Keough), whom their father plans to remarry. The relationship between them is under the sign of suicides, that of the mother of the children and those of the members of the religious cult whose leader was Grace's father. The father intended bringing the three together to give them the opportunity to better know each other and reconcile, but nothing will go according to plan.'The Lodge' drew a lot of attention at the 2019 Sundance festival, but will be released in North America only now, after one year, in February. I think that it has at least a moderate chance of success. Many of the recipes of the genre films are present and their mixing in a family drama amplifies the tension. The story runs smoothly, the surprises are not lacking, and the atmosphere becomes darker as the white snow accumulates around the lodge. Dream and reality, older and newer traumas, insanity and religious fanaticism mix and are questioned. The ending satisfactorily clarifies everything we've seen before, and reopens the discussion of whether the endings of films like this should clarify everything or leave certain details more open to interpretations and discussions. We will not settle this debate here. The cinematography belongs to Thimios Bakatakis, the author of some of Yorgos Lanthimos's films, and the fact that the atmosphere resembles that in 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' is not accidental. I also found Riley Keough's acting to be very good in a complicated and very physically and psychologically demanding role.'The Lodge' is not a pleasant movie, and those who avoid psychological thrillers and horror films will do well to bypass it. Others will have a chance to see a good movie.",The Lodge
14,ThomasDrufke,Hauntingly Atmospheric,7,10 March 2020,"The strength of The Lodge lies within its mind-bending/suffering script and hauntingly atmospheric direction. These are the types of horror films that do in fact creep me out. It's the same reason I was much more of a fan of 'It Comes at Night' than most people. The offscreen horror in these films has always produced more heart racing scares than your average clown/monster jumping out behind a door would. For the most part, The Lodge is a grueling (but always interesting) watch that challenges its viewers to be open to a story without much hope or sunshine. Does it succeed on all levels? Not really, its final 15 minutes started to lose me a bit, but the acting from Jaeden Martell, Lia McHugh and the always fantastic Riley Keough kept me invested.7.1/10",The Lodge

The mood and atmosphere were very good in this movie. There aren't many of usual horror ""cliches"" in this movie - story was surprisingly better then in looked on a surface, and this movie was more involving towards its second act and at the end it was a very dark story.Overall, i enjoyed ""The Lodge"" more then i thought i will be.

16,westsideschl,Different in Some Ways,7,5 June 2020,"Setting: Usual isolated snowbound house.
Plot: Clever/different opening scenes; didn't see that coming - unnerving. First 1/3 had a nice flow as tension builds, but dragged a bit after that. Final scenes, also didn't see that setup happening and just as unnerving. Left for viewer to finish, but I don't think it ends well. Some may find some of the Christian & cult subplots such as the enticement of Heaven, ""Death, however, is but a new beginning, a new start."", a bit too unsettling to their sensibilities, but that's reality.
Rewrite: Couldn't figure out how the doll house fit in. A more supernatural/horror storyline would have connected the dollhouse characters to the real ones in some fantastical way. Too many little odd scenes that didn't do much like one nosebleed; the dog's role.",The Lodge

They will soon face some strange events and they will have to be united in order to overcome them.I had high hopes and high expectations from this movie because after watching its trailer I was convinced that it will be scary and very interesting. Unfortunately, after watching it I was disappointed because the movie was very slow and made it very boring despite the interesting plot. I believe the pace of movie has ruined everything including its good potential. I have to admit that I liked the interpretations of both Riley Keough's who played as Grace and Jaeden Martell's who played as Aiden Hall but they were not enough. Finally, I have to say that ""The Lodge"" is an average movie and nothing more, if you want to watch it then you should lower your expectations in order not to be disappointed.",The Lodge
19,eddie_baggins,A moody but forgettable slow-burn horror,4,3 June 2020,"Those seeking fast moving and visceral horror experiences should be giving The Lodge a very wide berth, with directors Severin Fiala & Veronika Franz bringing the same slow burning intensity to their Hollywood debut that they established in their festival hit Goodnight Mommy, but The Lodge doesn't make the most of the tools at its disposal as it becomes an unbelievable and meandering affair.Filled with ample mood and atmosphere, The Lodge has moments of pure dread filled intrigue and suspense but as a cold and depressive pre-Christmas affair between grieving siblings Aiden and Mia and daddie's new one time cult member fiancee Grace takes hold on the film, you begin to quickly grow tired of the cat and mouse games the film and its characters play on us as we sense things are not going to end up with milk and cookies around the open fire.There's a lot of padding in the film as Richard Armitage's father nicely leaves his children with a damaged, mentally unstable victim of abuse of manipulation to look after them and while the film maintains a level of believability early on, that quickly gives way to a plot that never really gels the way in which it should as motivations, abilities and developments don't always appear to be clearly defined or worked out.Viewers don't want their horror's believable as such but suspension of belief can only take us so far and the core of The Lodge's conflict's all stem from decisions and happenings that don't sit well, stopping the ability of its three main cast members from ensuring The Lodge becomes the next underground horror hit.As she's done over the last couple of years, Riley Keough is once more a standout member of an ensemble she is a part of, instilling Grace with a sense of vulnerability, menace and sadness.Keough's impressive turn deserved a better overall outcome and some of the films best singular scenes stem from her interactions with Jaeden Martell's Aiden and Lia McHugh's dole-loving Mia, with the two not always as innocent as they at times seem.Final Say -Filled with moments of promise and some lovingly staged mood pieces, The Lodge has some fine horror stylings to match it with the best but its disappointing narrative and murky character motivations hold it back from its potential, ending up in an unfitting finale that will soon make the film itself forgotten.2 frozen pooches out of 5",The Lodge

It should mean something, or at minimum have some sort of emotional / intellectual impact, outside of being a humorless, pointless downer.

We then go to ""6 months later"", and Richard is trying to convince the kids that the 4 of them (Richard, Grace, Aden and Mia) should spend the days leading up to Christmas in the lodge away in the countryside.

At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is co-directed by Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, Franz made the excellent 2014 thriller ""Goodnight Mommy"", so that was a good sign. Here they bring a scary movie in a familiar setting, the remotely located lodge. The lodge is dark and cold, and did I say isolated? This a plot-heavy movie, so I am not in a position to say a whole lot more without spoiling, so I shan't. Alicia Silverstone alert! It wasn't until the movie end credits rolled that I noticed that the small role of Laura is played by none other than Alicia Silverstone. Silverstone, now in her early 40s, is a quarter century removed from ""Clueless"", and still going at it with some regularity. Riley Keough (It Comes At Night; American Honey) is quite good in the main role of Grace. Other than that, this movie is okay (not great, but okay), but does take a very long time to really settle in.""The Lodge"" premiered at the 2019 Sundance film festival (yes, over a year ago) to positive acclaim, and is just now getting a limited theater release (given the movie's Christmas setting, I cannot understand why this wasn't released last October or November). The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended well (6 people in total), and I really don't see this playing in the theaters much longer.

25,jtindahouse,A horror film that will leave you stunned,10,29 April 2020,"There is no pleasure in life greater than watching a terrific horror movie. They are becoming so rare these days that when a great one comes along it is something to be savoured. 'The Lodge' is one of those films. Immediately I could tell how well it was made, but it was the content that really made it what it was. The story was a slow-burn, yet it was immensely gripping. I needed to know what was going to happen next and where it was heading - and I was not let down by the answers. The way this film finished will stick with me for a long time.When Alicia Silverstone appeared on screen I tried to remember the last time I had seen her in a film and I came up empty. She was a pretty big name in the 90s, but her career fell off a steep cliff. I was looking forward to seeing whether she still had the same charisma and acting chops. The movie then took one of the most drastic and unexpected turns I have ever seen in a film. I was stunned. It left me reeling. It only made the casting of Silverstone that much better though.The first movie from these filmmakers 'Goodnight Mommy' was a tremendous horror film, but I would suggest 'The Lodge' is even better. They have obviously picked up some tips from Ari Aster along the way (you'd be crazy not to, right) and added that into their own unique style and format. I can't recommend 'The Lodge' highly enough. You can't afford to miss films this good.",The Lodge
26,jadavix,Snowed in and frozen out,8,18 January 2021,"""The Lodge"" is not unlike the previous movie by the same directors, ""Goodnight Mommy"", which also featured a battle of wills between two children and a surrogate mother figure. The threat of violence was always under the surface there as it is here, and both were uncomfortable viewing experiences.""The Lodge"" however is more interested in getting inside the head of its mother facsimile. She is a survivor of a cult, haunted and perhaps fractured with PTSD, and swallows pills to maintain her grip on reality. The children are her fiancé's, and their actual mother took her own life when she found out her husband was marrying the survivor. When the husband idiotically takes this utterly unhappy, dysfunctional ersatz family to the titular lodge during a snowstorm, and then leaves them on their own, the stage is set for something we know will not be pleasant.""The Lodge"" is a very well made, well acted movie, and as such is very unpleasant.

This is a disturbing horror movie because there are times when I wasn't exactly sure of who was doing what. Richard and Alicia are a married couple-with 2 kids-that are separated and getting a divorce. Richard has moved on with a new girl friend Riley, but Alicia is still clinging to the hopes of a reconciliation-she hasn't signed the divorce papers yet. Richard decides that it would be beneficial for his kids to get to know Riley and so they take a trip to a lodge in the mountains. Jaeden is Richard's son that does not want to go-he and his sister don't want Riley taking their mother's place. Richard is then called away for work, so the kids and their future step mom are alone in a snowed in house for days. Awkward situations arise, Jaeden and his little sister discover secrets of Riley's past-involving cults & mass murders-and strange things start happening in the house, like things start to disappear including food, clothes and even objects. Who is doing it? The only thing I did not care for was the ending. It left questions unanswered, at least for me.
It's rated ""R"" for disturbing violence, bloody images and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.

Directors: Severin Fiala, Veronika Franz and Writers: Sergio Casci, Severin Fiala very much dialed in a sense of of claustrophobic dread.The acting is excellent. Alicia Silverstone, Riley Keough were on point and conveyed their dramatic sense of emotions fantastically. The children Jaeden Martell, Lia McHughreally did a great job in this film as well, maintaining the somber tone. And in doing so are dealt serious dose of comeuppance.The Lodge has one of the best setups I have seen for a psychological horror film in a long time. There is ample misdirection that severs the dark plot line with telling a compelling human-story that slowly builds up the tension to a powerful climax.The Lodge is very much a slow burner,it manages to create interpersonal tension among the characters intensely . The screenplay is masterful at toeing a 'fine line' between what is real and who is at fault for what is occurring. Remarkably well-done psychological Drama, Horror, Thriller. Dour and riveting ; It left me emotional drained and pondering long after the credits rolled. If you enjoy a slow burn, psychological horror that is truly disturbing, and very unsettling. The Lodge is what you want to watch. Brooding and dark film. 9/10",The Lodge
29,parry_na,Exceptional slow burner.,9,8 September 2021,"This is an extraordinary horror film from the modern Hammer stable. Despite the company having made a name for itself as a UK company, 'The Lodge' didn't even get an official release in the UK, which is ridiculous.'The Lodge' takes its time building up the central character of Grace (Riley Keough), and we really don't know what kind of person she will turn out to be. Alicia Silverstone plays Laura, and her character's fate will, I think, surprise you.Just about everything about this film is wonderful. The characters are sympathetic - even the troubled children, which is a very difficult thing to get right (often a juvenile's problems are displayed by petulance, which is absolutely not the case here). The location is wonderfully isolated, and the tale is expertly told, teasing the audience with a number of possibilities - none of them pleasant.The main twist is very effective, more so because it is revealed in very unspectacular fashion, and the overall story is as bleak as anything you might have expected. My score is 9 out of 10.",The Lodge

Entire film full of boring conversation and overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching things scene, overuse of the dreaming scene, and overuse of the watching through the window scene! Make the film unwatchable!

31,dar0417,Pace was not right,5,26 February 2020,This one is getting some solid reviews and I am not sure why. In the films defense the premise was scary enough and the acting was fine but the pace of the film was off by something that I was checking my watch to see when this will end. The film does have some shock factors that worked well and a few twist.,The Lodge
32,drownnnsoda,Dour and riveting,9,21 February 2020,"""The Lodge"" follows two children-a teenage boy and his young sister-who are towed away to their familial lodge for Christmas with their father and his new fiancée, Grace, a woman who was raised in a Catholic separatist cult that committed a mass suicide. When the children are left with Grace after their father has to make a business trip back into the city, things get progressively sinister.To go into too much detail could ruin this film for those who have not seen it, so I will spare the details, but I was extremely impressed by ""The Lodge."" It's drawn comparisons to several films from the recent horror renaissance, such as ""Hereditary,"" though I think I preferred ""The Lodge"" more. It's also a far more threatening, sinister film than its directing team, Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz's previous feature, ""Goodnight Mommy,"" which had a similar plot setup.While ""The Lodge"" is very much a slow burner, the first act manages to create interpersonal tension among the characters masterfully; anyone who is a child of divorce will find these sequences profoundly realistic and discomforting. The film eases its audience into this feeling of awkwardness slowly before descending into a purgatorial hell-hole about midway through. The screenplay is masterful at toeing a fine line between what is real and who is at fault for what is occurring--it's the type of screenplay that would make for a fantastic novel, and is perhaps even better fitted for that medium. The film eventually shows its cards in the final act before leaving us with one of the darkest film conclusions in recent memory.A substantial part of why this film works so well rests in the strength of the performances. Riley Keough is both meek and terrifying by turns, while the children--Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh--are both very believable. Richard Armitage has a supporting role as their father, and Alicia Silverstone appears in a brief (but powerful) role as their mother. Another core strength is the photography, which is dark and consistently ominous. The wooden-walled interiors of the home are oppressive and unwelcoming, and contrast sharply with the snowy exteriors.All in all, I found this film to be a remarkably well-done psychological thriller. Audiences need not expect a popcorn film, though, or they will be disappointed. ""The Lodge"" doesn't necessarily play for amusement, but rather a bit of good, old-fashioned madness. Recommended for fans of psychological, sparse storytelling. Most others will find it too bitter a pill to swallow. 9/10.",The Lodge
33,Pairic,A Tale Of Two Lodges,8,10 November 2020,"The Lodge: Not one creepy house but two; there's The Lodge itself in the upstate Massachusetts wilderness and a doll's house model of it. At time it;s difficult to tell the interiors apart. Laura Hall (Alicia Silverstone) commits suicide when her estranged husband Richard Hall (Richard Armitage) informs that he is going to marry Grace Marshall (Riley Keough). Grace is the only survivor of a mass suicide by a Religious Cult, we see film of the Prophet preaching followed by the dead sect members, then we realise that Grace is doing the filming. Aidan (Jaeden Martell) and Mia Hall (Lia McHugh) grieve for their mother and are hostile towards Grace, Mia has a strange doll. Richard decides to spend Christmas at The Lodge to ty and bring them all together. Disaster intervenes at an early stage as Grace falls through the ice as they skate on a lake but is rescued. Richard reluctantly returns to the city to deal with work, Grace assures him all will be fine, he'l back to the wilds for Christmas Day. Then things get strange, food and clothes disappear. A weird film, we first see Grace in silhouette and through frosted glass. Her nightmares are truly deranged. what is really going on though? We have several plot twists before we head towards a terrifying climax. Most of the horror here is psychological but there are some shocking and violent scenes. Good performances by Keough, Martell and McHugh. It comes in at 108 minutes, IMO it would have been a better Horror-Thriller at 98 minutes.

I had the entire movie spoiled for me before I ever turned it on, and I still ended up watching it all the way through. Very well done.",The Lodge
36,TdSmth5,Not much to it,4,26 December 2020,"A guy tells his ex, with whom he has two children, that he wants to marry his girlfriend. That causes a rather extreme reaction in her.Months later, the guy takes his two children and his new girl Grace to a their winter lodge in the middle of nowhere. The kids don't want to have anything to do with her. She tries to get along with them to no avail. Worse, he decides to leave them there for a couple of days.We learn a couple of things about Grace. She was the sole survivor of a suicidal religious cult. She takes meds for something, perhaps to sleep. The father of the kids meanwhile is a psychiatrist who wrote a book and Grace's case is part of that book. Grace also sleepwalks at night.One morning Grace wakes up only to find all things missing, including her pills. Cell phones don't work, power goes out, the generator doesn't work either. And of course this in the middle of a snowstorm. Grace decides to walk to the next town but doesn't make it far and after having some more hallucinations of the pastor and his cult.Then the teenage boy suggests that perhaps the three are dead and are now in purgatory. To prove it, he tries to hang himself but doesn't die. They suggest that Grace has to repent her sins for them to make it to heaven. This pushes Grace into a downward spiral toward madness. Eventually the genius psychiatrist returns but by then what shape will Grace be in? The answer is that she's in bad shape and he will suffer for it.The Lodge was written and directed by the team behind Goodnight Mommy. And there are similarities, it has a similar tone, and the theme of kids being up to no good is the same. This movie starts fairly stylishly. The lodge looks huge and modern on the outside, yet is oddly small and old on the inside. For a while one gets the impression that it will be style over substance. But quickly it sets aside substance as well, leaving the viewer with...not a whole lot really. When a movie doesn't offer much for a long time, and this movie is much longer than it needs to be, you know that it will be all about the ending. Like Goodnight Mommy was, except that there the ending did much more to redeem the movie than here. This movie has 3 interesting and more or less surprising moments. The actions of the kids could have been turned into a revelation, but for some reason the crew decided not to take advantage of it, which they could have easily done. Instead they bet it all one the last minutes of the movie, and it's not nearly as striking as they hoped it would be. I Can't recommend this movie.",The Lodge

38,aidanratesmovies,"More style over substance, but not a total waste of time",6,15 July 2020,"Well acted, atmospheric, but at times contrived, The Lodge seems to take too much time copying similar elements from other horror projects, rather than thinking of anything very original itself. The film, for the majority of it anyway, is lead by actress Riley Keough who is by far the films greatest strength in her role as Grace, a young step mother. I'll stop and say that the acting throughout the film, although there is mainly only a few performances, is quite good, and it is quite interesting to see these characters and their strengths and flaws play out until the end credits. That being said, somewhere down the line in this film, The Lodge seems to get lost in its own plot, and seems to lack much of a purpose at all. It's story goes a bit all over the place, with its beginning seeming emotional, its middle seeming creepy and atmospheric, and its end seeming like a hodgepodge of things to tie up. The film can be interesting to watch, but isn't terribly entertaining, as it proves to be more of a slow burn to watch throughout. It's a bit disappointing to watch by the end, especially since the film seems like it has so much potential. It has a great atmosphere, and seems to be heavily inspired by the works of Hereditary and other films like it, but it just doesn't seem to amount to much. In the end, The Lodge seems to be nothing more than an average and somewhat forgettable horror flick that would be better served if if were cooked just a little bit more through.

40,truemythmedia,Good But Very Predictable,6,21 February 2020,"This was one of my most anticipated films of the year, and while I wouldn't call ""The Lodge"" a disappointment, it certainly wasn't what I was expecting.I'm a huge horror fan, and I was blown away by Severin Fiala and Veronikka Franz's first (narrative) film: ""Goodnight Mommy"", which came out six years ago. The trailers for ""The Lodge"" made it look like a straight up horror movie on par with ""Hereditary""; reviewers were even quoted in said trailers, saying that ""The next great horror film is here.""I'm going to refute that claim. This is not a great horror movie; it's a very competent but somewhat frustrating thriller. I don't think this movie is very scary, but I do think the things that happen in the third act are undeniably horrific, inventive, and unnerving. It's a disturbing thriller that takes a very long time to get to the disturbing moments, and that's part of the reason I found this film to be a bit frustrating. I found ""The Lodge"" was also a little bit heavy-handed with its foreshadowing, so it became easily predictable for those that are used to the tropey twists of the genre.At the same time, the story that this movie told was one that I thought was compelling, and towards the end, when the horrific elements start to ramp up, it really grabbed my attention; the problem was that it took about twenty minutes too long to get there, and the film isn't very long in the first place. I liked the story ""The Lodge"" tells, but the lack of payoff for the first two-thirds of the film really tests the patience of the viewer, and it's clear that this film takes heavy inspiration from recent horror greats (""Hereditary"" in particular- there's a lot of interior miniature shots).",The Lodge

42,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Haunting Tale of Isolation, Madness and Religion",10,11 November 2019,"This was a film that was on my radar from early in the year. I knew that it was doing well at film festivals so it was one that I was waiting to get released. I lucked out when I saw that at the Nightmares Film Festival it was showing for its regional premiere. It was one that I knew I was going to see for sure. The synopsis is a soon-to-be stepmom is snowed in with her fiancé's two children at a remote holiday cabin. Just as relations begin to thaw between the trio, some strange and frightening events takes place.We start with a mother, Laura (Alicia Silverstone), at home with her two children. Her older son is Aidan (Jaeden Martell) and daughter Mia (Lia McHugh). She has a dollhouse which we learn is modeled after the cabin that they go during the winter. Laura calls her ex-husband, Richard (Richard Armitage) to bring the children over. She's making sure that his new girlfriend won't be there.She was told that Grace (Riley Keough) wouldn't be, but we see a glimpse of her in a window and then Laura sees her sneaking out the back gate. Through some subtle things, we know that Laura wants to get back together with Richard and is devastated to learn that he plays to ask Grace to marry him. This leads to a traumatic event that rocks this family to the core.Richard tries to get his children to come around to Grace, but they blame her for what happened. Through them snooping, we learn that Grace has a dark past as her father was the head of a cult and she is the only survivor. Richard tries to have her over for Thanksgiving, but the children lose their minds so he rethinks it.This all leads to his plan for them to go up to the cabin for Christmas. He still has to work so his plan is to take them up, get them acclimated and then go back, forcing the three to work it out in isolation. There's definitely some awkwardness as Laura decorated the place and there's still things that belonged to her there. They do seem to be making progress until one morning, they wake up to everything they brought is now missing.Now since this is still a film that hasn't been released just yet and still making the rounds, I wanted to give as much a recap without spoiling anything. I will say that this film definitely lived up to the hype for me. It is such a haunting tale that has a feel of something like Hereditary or Midsommar.There's an interesting family dynamics here. We have children who are living in broken homes after their parents divorced. They want them to get back together, which is exactly what Laura wants as well. Richard has moved on though. Grace is interesting as I feel like she's a little bit awkward due to her past. Being raised in a cult, she has lasting effects from it.That's what I really want to delve into next is the religious aspect here. The cult Grace was in was religious based. They took it to the extreme. When they get to the cabin, there's a creepy picture of a nun that looks stern as well as a giant cross. Grace is now at the least agnostic due to the trauma. As she descends into madness, her religious history flares up, which I find quite intriguing.This film also flirts with is what happening supernatural or is it really happening. I really dug this mystery if I'm going to be perfectly honest. The morning they wake up and everything was before they got there freaked me out. Then every time Grace looks at a certain clock that shows the date, it keeps going back to the same one. This is unnerving and makes her start to think they could have died and are in purgatory. Now this is I guess is a bit of spoiler, but there's a journey to figure out the truth.That takes me to the pacing of this one, which the runtime clocks in at 100 minutes. I heard the saying that 90 minutes and below are free, anything over that you really have to prove to me it needs to be there. I completely think this film needed that extra time. There was a couple times my jaw actually dropped in shock. I was sucked into this film and trying to figure out what happened. There were things I even missed that were shared with me later that made me like this one even more. With that said, I thought it was paced very well and I like how it ended as I'm down for bleak endings.Moving to the acting of the film, it is definitely on point. Keough was great as the lead here. I love how subdued she plays the character, but as things around her start to break down we see her descend into madness. She's mentally disturbed from her past and with the stress, we see her reverting. It had me hooked to see. Martell and McHugh did really well as the children also. Martell was made famous from the two It movies but I have to say I'm quite impressed with him for his age. Silverstone and Armitage are solid in support here as well.As for the effects of the film, we really don't need a lot of them as it isn't that type of film. To be honest though, the realism of them being stranded in this cabin felt real. We do get some practical things later on that looked good. If anything though, this film is shot very well and I was impressed by that for sure.Now with that aside, despite my high expectations, I felt that this one lived up to them. It is such a haunting film of loss and I really like how they incorporate that this could be supernatural or that it could not be. It is done in a way that doesn't feel like a cheat as well, as we see little hints along the way. The pacing works to build tension and I love how everything ended. The acting was great across the board, which can be tough sticking three characters alone for most of the film. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but it doesn't necessarily need them. It is shot well and the soundtrack fit for what was needed as well. Overall I'd say this is a really good movie and it stuck with me after checking out it. I would recommend this to horror and non-horror fans for sure.",The Lodge

We have children who are living in broken home after their parents are separated. They want them to get back together, which is exactly what Laura wants as well. Richard has moved on though. My girlfriend who saw this with me brought up an interesting point. We see that the children do not like Grace and blame her for what happened. I didn't pick up on this, but she tossed out the idea that Richard had an affair with Grace so that feeling of blame makes sense. Something else interesting about Grace is she's a little bit awkward due to her past. Being raised in a cult, she has lasting effects from it. The social norms don't really seem to be there and it is reflected in things that she says at times.What I really want to delve into next is the religious aspect here. The cult Grace was in was religious based. They took it to the extreme. When they get to the cabin, there's a creepy picture of a nun that looks stern looming over the dining room table as well as a giant cross. Grace is now at the least agnostic due to the trauma. As she descends into madness, she falls back into her religious path for comfort, which I find quite intriguing. It can be heard through the voice of her father. It makes you wonder for a good portion of the film, is she really hearing it or is it in her head.Going along with this idea, what is happing flirts with being supernatural or is it real. I really dug this mystery if I'm going to be perfectly honest. The morning they wake up and everything was before they got there freaked me out.

It is after a reveal that I didn't remember though that erased that so I still agree with this assessment.Moving to the acting of the film, it is definitely on point. Keough was great as the lead here. I love how subdued she plays the character, but as things around her start to break down we see her descend into madness. She's mentally disturbed from her past and with the stress, we see her reverting. It had me hooked and I feel horrible for her. It doesn't help they're snowed in and the power is out. The two children don't like her so it adds to the isolation. Martell and McHugh did really well as the children also.

To be honest though, the realism of them being stranded in this cabin felt real. We do get some practical things later on that looked good. It feels cold, which is good. If anything though, the cinematography is what really helps to drive some of the tension. We get a lot of slow zoom ins and outs. It lingers on things which make it feel even more unnerving. I was really impressed there to be honest.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. It really helps to build that sense of dread and uneasy feeling as well. There's quite a bit of string instruments, which is par for the course when you're dealing with a movie with this type of brooding feeling. It would actually be a score I would like to add to my collection while I'm writing to be honest.Now with that aside, despite my high expectations, I felt that this one lived up to them.

I will warn you, this is a heavy movie and there are a lot of emotions here. My rating also came up slightly as this is a damn near perfect film.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10SPOILERSI wanted to do this section here as there's a lot in this movie. The first thing is that the event I hinted at is that Laura kills herself. I tossed out the theory that my girlfriend suggested that Richard had an affair with Grace while writing his book about cults. There's a subtle hint from Aidan while he is going through his father's computer for information and he shares that with Mia. Laura and the children want her to get back together with Richard, but when that isn't the case, Laura kills herself.Richard keeps pushing his children to get closer to Grace where Aidan comes up with a plan to I'm assuming scare her off. This is introduced much like in Hereditary through Mia's dollhouse. We see it is modeled after the lodge they will be staying on.Their plan is drug Grace with a sleeping pill. They take down all of the decorations, but it was set up with a gas heater being used while they're watching the movie. Grace asks if it is safe, but the reason it is there is for Aidan to claim they died from asphyxiation. They're trying to tell Grace they're in purgatory. She isn't buying it, but she also is on medication which also has been hidden. It doesn't help that Grace has some scary dreams of what she dealt with that are getting worse under the stress that is around her. She is sleeping walking and the children are adding to that as well.After the second viewing, I looked at my girlfriend to say that I hated these children. They're horrible in what they're doing, but it is interesting is that all of these characters are horrible. Richard presumable cheated on his wife with having relations with the subject of his book and he knew she was troubled. Grace is troubled so I feel bad what the children did to her, but again, it seems she slept with a married man. Aidan and Mia are really to blame for all of the tragic events so there's sick satisfaction in me to see Richard killed in front of them. It is horrible for me to say, but I stand by it. This really is a deep movie and aside from I don't think everything the children did is plausible, this heavy movie really affected me and I love it.",The Lodge

45,begob,Shocked but not horrified,7,21 September 2021,"A girlfriend struggles for acceptance by her boyfriend's newly bereaved kids, but her past returns to haunt everyone ...The opening sequence hit me with such a shock that I spent the rest of the movie dreading the director's every move. The event is all the more harrowing for its casual execution, but even as I kept whispering OMG to myself the story slowly unfolded with great skill, especially in the cinematography, which added dimensions to the snowy exteriors and shadowy interiors. So I had a slow, icily atmospheric story constantly holding that same threat of unexpected violence over my head - the most effective jump scare I've seen, and one with material consequences for what follows.Great set up, but does the movie deliver? In the end it's a psychological chiller with a twist of lemon on the rocks, rather than a horror, and I was disappointed. The pity is that the story had the.elements of a true psychological journey, rather than plot trickery, through the psychic consequences of suicide on those left behind - just the kind of story that horror cinema is suited to, where we get to see thoughts brought to life on the screen. Surely these survivors have to engage over their common experience at some point? The Hereditary-style doll house in the opening scene was a promise of some over-arching force, but the film maker cheated and, instead, gave us a double-switchback with lumpy plausibility and an unexamined view of religious guilt.The performances are very good, but I thought the lead actress had a lot more to give to a character who was only sketched in outline; and the son may have been miscast, because the role needed earlier signs of his deviousness. Also a problem in the role of the father, common to many horrors, is that he anchors the family in the opening act but is sent away while the position shifts, and returns only to provide an outsider's POV, with no shift in his own position.The director is excellent at catching mood and atmosphere, and also the contrast in the opening act between liveliness and the weight of death and grief. Cinematography was just beautiful, with several visual metaphors to add to the doll house, and the sound design and music were interesting and always effective,Overall: Some great quality, but a deliberate dumbing down of a complex story.",The Lodge
46,rivertam26,Intense,8,3 March 2020,"Sadly, this movie is going criminally under noticed. This stylish, provocative, terrifying, disturbing horror thriller is brimming with strong performances all around. The movie centers on a pair of siblings who go away with their father and his new girlfriend after their mother has committed suicide. It's uncomfortable to say the least. And things get worse when the father had to leave for business. You see Grace the father's new girl suffered trauma some time ago when she was the only survivor of a suicide cult. Strange occurrences begin to happen from her missing clothes, to their loss of power and creepy voices and visions. The atmosphere is thick with dread and the movie is psychologically tormenting. The movie feels surreal and it's such a strange( in a good way) cinematic experience. I knew from pretty early on what was going to happen but I didn't know to what degree and was still shocked as things began to roll out. This was the movie I wanted Hereditary to be it's a aesthetically pleasing waking nightmare of a film. I would also like to point out Alicia Silverstone does the best work of her career here. In a small role she makes an amazing impression and in my opinion deserves some awards buzz.

51,IonicBreezeMachine,"It won't be for everyone, but The Lodge is an effective exercise in slow descending isolation and insanity",8,30 August 2020,"The Lodge has been a rather divisive point between critics and audiences, audiences have been more split on the film while critics have been more inclined to view the film favorably. This is not a movie made for a mass horror audience like the films made by Blumhouse or Atomic Monster, rather this is a character study with a no holds barred approach to its themes of lingering trauma and toxic religiosity. The film follows Aiden(Jaeden Martell) and Mia(Lia McHugh) who after the suicide of their mother Laura(Alicia Silverstone) live with their father Richard(Richard Armitage) and soon to be stepmother Grace (Riley Keough). Richard, needing to work through the holiday season arranges for the two to spend time with Grace at lodge in the woods that they frequent in the hopes that they will bond, but once there strange happenings coupled with the lingering resentment and bitterness felt by Aiden and Mia towards Grace for their mother's suicide a slow decent into terror begins.The Lodge as horror film is very effective at building its mood and atmosphere. The titular lodge becomes a character itself with its empty halls, surrounding frozen landscapes, and generally sense of foreboding created by its minimal lighting and cavernous nature. Be it in the dark of the night or the light of day there is never any sense of comfort felt while in the lodge and a general feeling of unease permeates the film.The characters aren't written with much in the way of depth, but they do effectively convey the feelings we expect given the circumstances. The crushing despair felt during the opening act's funeral, the mixture of boredom, restlessness, and unease felt during the second act, and finally the sheer terror and resignation that serves as the penultimate lead up to the films final moments. It's a movie where the minimalism is put to good use because it respects its audience enough not to through in a jump scare every few minutes.The overall narrative deals with heavy themes of grief and religion as the two kids, Aiden and Mia, are devout Catholics as raised by their deceased mother Laura. Grace herself has distanced herself from religion later in life as her involvement with a extremist Christian cult left her with lingering trauma that serves as another point of contention between herself and the children. A key point in which the religious themes come into play is because the children are Catholic they believe their mothers soul will never be able to find peace.The Lodge uses its themes of religiosity sparingly, and it's not so much of an indictment of religion itself, but more of the followers of said religions who twist what was once a well meaning doctrine into justification for acts of ugliness and barbarism that while not as explicitly graphic as your average Saw or Hostel film leave a haunting emptiness once we bear witness to the proceedings.With that said however this movie will not be to everyone's taste. The movie is a slow burn with long stretches broken up by the occasional nightmare or sudden noise and there's very little dialogue among the characters so the audience will need to actively look for character in subtle interactions rather than through conversation. The films use of religious iconography may also seem insulting to some who feel themselves to be among the faithful but with that said I don't believe this film to carry any ill will towards the majority of Christians and it's more about those who twist the doctrine as justification for heinous actions. However the ending may leave some wondering where the film stands given where we eventually end up, but it does make a good topic of conversation for people to explore their differing views.The Lodge is an effectively unsettling slow burn horror film that uses its minimalist aesthetics economically and effectively. From its effective performances to its barren landscapes and claustrophobic cinematography it'll leave viewers in a state of unease that makes them feel as though they're stuck in the titular lodge along side the characters.",The Lodge

53,ElijahCSkuggs,Are you easily triggered? Join our religious cult today!,5,23 February 2020,"2020's first hyped up horror film, The Lodge, is a take on hysteria with the tried and true setting of a remote home in the wilderness. Will The Lodge make you want to drink the cool-aid or will you end up taking another look at the Scientology brochure?The set-up is a Father, son and daughter decide to use their remote cabin to celebrate Christmas. Kicker is Dad is bringing along his new love, which as you will come to find out, is not thought fondly of by his children. Well, of course they all go anyways. Dad has to take off for a meeting back in the city almost as soon as they arrive and will have to leave his girlfriend and two kids alone while he's away. No big deal, right? Well, it kind of is when your girlfriend has a checkered past of being a mental-case. Don't forget the fact that the kids really don't like this woman.So I went into this totally blind. I just saw a couple joyous reviews about the next great horror and I said why not. But first, let me start off by saying I don't care for cult based stories. I'll watch a documentary on the subject only for the fact that I'm stunned by how easily manipulated people are, but as for cult involvement and/or cult hysterics used as a scare tactic strikes me as ridiculous and almost verging on silly. I'm aware that people do go kaka-cuckoo with cults and they really lose their own self in the process but, it just doesn't work for me on a horror level, especially when it's religious themed. Anyone else play Far Cry 5? That's what I'm talking about. Cringey snooze of a story. So if you're like me and don't care for the cult/religion business, this isn't going to make you dig the sub-genre any more.While having some decent and curious set-ups, the filmmakers absolutely dropped the ball with executing a story that scares or, hell, even cares. It's just one big set-up that doesn't do a damn thing in the end. Build up a story to it's logical and predictable finale, and then...just end it there. That's a great idea. Let's just make it a black and white scenario of hysteria with barely any legit background or any genuine character development and let's just ride our coattails on what-ifs. How about this what if? What if, your movie was a waste of my time? Oh, my bad, that's not a what if. That's how I felt as I squirming about in my movie theater chair waiting for this kuk to finish up. It's not kuk but it's not very good either. The highlights of this film for me was seeing the lead actress's breasts and my gigantic fart I so handsomely released when the sound went up in the theater. Lodge 0 - Me 1",The Lodge

55,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,A decent horror film,6,28 April 2020,"An okay horror film that borrows heavily from Hereditary (2018) and your typical religious cult horror film. But this film's story isn't as deep, and filled with multi-layer visual meanings like Hereditary. This film mixes up Catholicism with suicidal religious cults, including hollywood cliché of religions with walls filled with crucifixes. Stuff that makes your eyes roll. But the acting performances were pretty good and so was the cinematography. But the film is filled with characters making dumb decisions or doing things that a normal person would not do.It's worth a watch, but once is enough. Hereditary on the other hand takes a couple of watches to see the fine subtle details the director put in. I wouldn't include The Lodge as smart horror. More like a B-movie version of Hereditary.That being said, the actors gave pretty good performances. Especially Riley Keough and Lia McHugh. Jaeden Martell, no so much.

59,Neptune165,Definitely the worst horror movie I've seen this year so far,3,1 May 2020,"This wasn't a horror movie it was a horrible movie. I got bored and massively disappointed. I think the actual horror and tragedy in the film is that Grace was trying to redeem herself and be a good person as she moved away from her past (her medication and her dog Grady helped) but the kids blamed Grace for their parents separation and their mother's suicide. Vengeance led to suffering, in many ways the characters fell into their own nightmare. She didn't die when she tried to shoot herself at the end because the gun was a revolver. If there isn't a bullet in the chamber then nothing will come out. The gun was working perfectly fine. There was a bullet in the next chamber so when she pulled the trigger next, a bullet came out. The ending shot shows us that there are 2 more bullets left in the revolver, The story is VERY thin and has that many holes, Grace tries so hard to hold on to her sanity, but of course the children keep going. Worse ending in a movie. I'm sorry, but the movie was stupid. Was utter nonsense. Plot holes all over the place. I cared more for that poor woman than the little crazy kids.

60,msbreviews,"The Lodge has all the ingredients that usually don't conquer audiences... Fortunately, I love all of them!",8,9 May 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you probably know by now, I'm a huge horror fan. An outstanding horror movie is almost always one of the best films of the year for me. I find it frustrating that so many people don't value this genre as much as the others, especially since the general public usually tends to like the more generic narratives, filled with predictable jump scares, and dull stories. Nothing against that, obviously, anyone can like whatever they want! However, when comparing with other genres, horror feels like an outsider, only truly followed by a specific group of people, even though it's been admittedly growing in the last few years.I didn't expect much from The Lodge, which probably helped me enjoy it as much as I did since it's one of the favorite movies of 2020 so far. It's undoubtedly the least formulaic horror flick in quite a while. It features ingredients that, however, audiences are not that fond of: visual storytelling, slow pace, and almost zero jump scares. The first is incredibly captivating not only due to the clever framing and mise-en-scène but also because the dark atmosphere fills the house in a very ominous manner. Its lack of dialogue throughout the runtime might be a no-go for some people, but I love when films ""show, don't tell"".The purposefully slow pace is very well-balanced. With the exception of a short period during the second act, where nothing really happens (no new information about story or characters is given to the viewer), every other scene is meaningful either to develop characters or forward the story. The screenplay is structured in a way that never stops being entertaining: something impactful occurs, characters react to it, something important is discovered, and so on. Between the events, the atmosphere never stops being creepy, and the minimal (but efficient) dialogue is remarkably intriguing.It's a movie that undoubtedly gains a lot from its notable technical attributes. From the astonishing cinematography (Thimios Bakatakis, who has worked with Yorgos Lanthimos in four films) to the exceptional production design, this one-location movie offers a claustrophobic environment elevated by brilliant performances. Riley Keough delivers one of the best performances I've seen from her, creating that perfect balance that makes the viewer question if her character is sane or crazy. The mystery surrounding Grace is partially due to Riley's fantastic interpretation.Jaeden Martell is really good, and I'm happy that he continues to get great projects to be part of. However, Lia McHugh is the undeniable standout, in my opinion. With just twelve-years-old, Lia gives such a phenomenal display. Her last scene of the film, which she shares with Jaeden, is award-worthy. Both are mind-blowingly compelling during that moment. Impressive performances across the board.Unfortunately, I do have a few issues regarding the characters. Grace's past is the biggest question mark of the story, and it's left unsatisfyingly ambiguous. The Lodge relies a lot on its visual storytelling, something I absolutely love, but in this particular aspect, I believe a more explicit explanation would have helped the viewer better understand Grace's development. My other problem is related to the kids' motivations, but I have to be very vague due to possible spoilers.Basically, their actions throughout the movie are justified by something that, while I can partially understand where they're coming from, I can't honestly believe that young children would be able to even think about it, let alone actually doing it seamlessly. This last sentence is the best I can do to describe my issue with these characters. In the end, I have some problems with the characters, but the story boasts some genuinely shocking moments (the first act is brilliant), and an extremely impactful, bold ending.The Lodge is one of my favorite films of 2020 so far. However, it possesses features that usually don't conquer the general public. For some people, its visual storytelling might be too ambiguous, its slow pace might be too boring, and the lack of jump scares might cause damage entertainment-wise. Fortunately, I love every single one of these aspects. This atmospheric horror flick is elevated by its outstanding technical attributes, especially Thimios Bakatakis' bizarre cinematography, as well as the claustrophobic production design. Boasting an impressive lead performance from Riley Keough and incredible displays from Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh (standout with just twelve-years-old), the Austrian directing duo (Severin Fiala, Veronika Franz) delivers one of the least generic horror movies in quite some time. Still, the three main characters deserved better development and more transparent motivations. I recommend it for true horror fans, but if you prefer a more ""active"" horror flick (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that), maybe it's better to skip this one.Rating: A-",The Lodge

64,Beejerman,JEER - (3 stars out of 10),3,24 August 2020,"The stage curtains open ...""The Lodge"" is an example of a promise made, but never kept. Some were promoting this as ""the next great horror film"", and ""nerve shredding"" - so I had high hopes when I went into this one. But, it definitely wasn't either of those. Then I noticed that it was directed by Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, the same two that brought us the absolutely abysmal, ""Goodnight Mommy"" - a film that truly lacked any redeeming quality whatsoever. Next time, I will do my homework before watching any ""game changing"" movies.The story starts with a man and his two children taking a trip to an out-of-the-way lodge when he wants to have his children get to know his fiance, Grace. This is a daunting task, since they blame Grace for their mother's death, who took her own life when their Dad wanted a divorce so that he and Grace could marry. To complicate things even more, he needs to leave for the city for a few days to take care of some matters at work. So, the two children and Grace are left alone in the isolated lodge in the dead of winter. Soon, things begin to disappear, they lose power, food is scarce, and emotional outbursts mount with paranoia building between them - leading to the film's final, dark eventuality.The film started out pretty good, the scenes and cinematography were amazing. I will give this movie that much, it had some very nice visuals. I personally think that Riley Keough is amazing, and she pours everything she has into this role as well. However, there is no real depth here. Everything is only surface deep. I had the same feeling when I watched ""Goodnight Mommy"". Overall, this was fairly boring and you have to drag yourself along to the final reveal, which wasn't worth the time invested. And where was the Dad this whole time? What was supposed to be only a few days, was more like a few weeks. The filmmakers seemed more focused on the ""idea"" behind the movie, rather than just making a good movie.I cannot recommend this film. It gets a paltry 3 stars out of 10 from me. It would have gotten only 1 star, but it gets an additional star for visuals, and another star for Riley Keough. Otherwise, I felt it was ultimately a failure on all levels.

This completely goes against the patient psychiatrist's code of practice. It does give it a strange tinge to the story ark in that a psychiatrist is so confident that he has fully restored her well being that he is willing to date her.Throughout the film it delves into whether or not she is fully recovered. This is put to a test when she is abandoned and snowed in with the widower's children. Strange things occur during the night & they evoke repressed memories that she wants to keep caged.

68,statuskuo,A Middle Of The Road Flick,6,16 February 2020,"""The Lodge"" is decidedly a mood piece made to illicit the works of early 40's gaslight flicks like ""Rebecca."" Though dark salacious secrets are revealed in that one, this one seems to meander a little too long. Still, it does have a creepiness in the concept. Two kids are left alone with a future stepmother who has a history of mental illness due to a trauma suffered at the hands of a suicide cult. Sounds interesting enough. But they seemed to have abandoned that focus and went for a creaky cabin in the middle of the nowhere sensibility instead.
Midway through the film, we do start to get a glimpse of potential. Initially, it's that the two children freeze future Mom, Grace (Riley Keough) out of the family dynamics, and has a DEEP sense of spirituality, but also ditches that for something more Earth bound, and, unfortunately, not that interesting.
The two children, Aidan (Jaeden Martell) and Mia (Lia McHugh) do a nice job playing siblings, but some moments that make you care for them in the beginning become really hard to bear once you realize the reality of what is happening. Too bad. Since there are were many avenues to explore. Most importantly Grace's slide in psychosis.
I love single room movies. And, for the most part, directors Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz exploit the titular lodge to great effect. But it falls short of true terror within the family dynamics.
Too many questions makes this less than a great film. It's close and has solid mood, but let's the banal become the reality, and suffers from audience members being a little...upset at the final frame.",The Lodge

76,lathe-of-heaven,"I agree with many here. Intriguing idea, and they really tried with the atmosphere. But, ultimately very poorly done and even more poorly acted...",4,4 May 2020,"Yep, that's about it. I can't imagine for the life of me why this film even has a 6.x rating now. I mean, there were MOMENTS here and there, especially with the long held shots of the miniatures and the Icon painting and such. It's like the framework was there, but quite honestly I just don't feel like they filled it in very well.Poor Alicia Silverstone, GEEZ... Anyway, I normally don't go out of my way to review films that I don't like, especially when there are nearly 200 reviews already, but finding that this one has what I feel is a rather mysterious 6.x rating when the seemingly 'genuine' reviews appear collectively to be pretty bad, I thought maybe I would throw my 2 cents in here too.Now, also in all fairness, like I mention in my subject line, I DO think that they were honestly shooting for a very atmospheric, desolate, isolated feel, VERY much like 'THE SHINING', even in the long static shots. So, like I said, I think the basic framework was there and the setting was good, but it's like the film makers just didn't really have any substantial idea as to what to do with it. And, really, to me anyway, I strongly felt that the acting was by FAR the worst part. Even our dear Ms. Silverstone, the little she was in the movie. But, mostly... really, REALLY bad acting all around. Maybe the children weren't too bad considering the awful writing (something else that really didn't help) but, other than the real effort with the atmosphere and the setting, you just REALLY wish that they had actually done something decent with it, that's all...I guess that is what kind of moved me to bother even to write a review when I really didn't have a whole lot to say. I guess I feel that twinge or longing or something in my heart where I feel that something COULD have honestly been made of this idea and setting, but I truly think that between the poor writing and for some unknown, mysterious reason the film makers' inability somehow to elicit even the barest acceptable performances are really what took this film down hard.Needless to say, although I did feel moved to come here and acknowledge the effort with the mood and such, I honestly cannot really recommend this film at all...",The Lodge

79,TwistedContent,"Probing the Psyche - A Love Letter (Review) to ""The Lodge"" and its Similars",8,30 April 2020,"""The Lodge"", even with all its flaws and misses which I'm going to discuss, embodies a great deal of what I love about the current era of horror movies. We have been scared by monsters, entities, axe wielding maniacs, all kinds of things that attacks us from the outside, but one of the most scary premises in existence is human brain itself and what it can do, act, endure, become. Relationship dysfunctionalities, mental illnesses, human mind dealing with traumas, the various often incomprehensible schemes of the mind - psychology of a (and everyone of us is a) flawed human has been adapted as an important and growingly popular theme of the horror genre in the past few years. I believe that a notable turning point was 2014, starting with ""The Babadook"", ""It Follows"", then ""The Witch"", ""Hereditary"", ""Midsommar"" and so on. Ari Aster and Robert Eggers are easily my two favorite horror directors working today, also endless appreciation goes out to A24 for being the studio that seems to have a specialty of depicting head trauma. ""The Lodge"" feels strongly like a spiritual relative to ""Hereditary"", which might very well been an important point of inspiration.""The Lodge"" ain't the first horror rodeo of the Austrian filmmakers Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz - in the aforementioned year of 2014 also out came their full feature debut ""Goodnight Mommy"", an unsettling family drama in the best arthouse traditions. As a debut, it set high expectations for whatever comes next, and if we don't count the very-mixed-bag folk horror anthology ""The Field Guide to Evil"" where Severin and Veronika participated, ""The Lodge"" is, I believe, an impressive and at least equally great sophomore feature. I have to point out that if it wasn't for the wish, mission and point of being objective, I would've given it more than 8/10 & from here on I'll try to elaborate.""The Lodge"" is about a fractured family, two kids (Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh) who are fighting their way through the consequences of a family trauma, a father (Richard Armitage) who has find new hope, and about that new hope named Grace (Riley Keough), a woman with a painful and mysterious past she's trying to get away from. Grace is about to become the stepmom for the two children, but before that happens, the father figures it'd be productive for Grace to spend some time together with the kids, it happens to be Christmas and happens to be spent at his remote, isolated holiday house, or the lodge. It's where relationships will become tense and strange, unexplainable events will take place.""The Lodge"" has all the makings of a great A24-esque horror movie (to my surprise it wasn't, props to Hammer films) and, for the sake of comparison, has a strong Ari Astery feel all over it. The plot/structure/explored themes are both the strength and weakness of ""The Lodge"". It is built to try and derail your expectations, surprise you as many times as it can, though a couple of pivotal moments I did predict, it didn't bother me much. ""The Lodge"" has an atmospheric, expertly crafted and eerie build up, though I can see why it can be slow, dull or boring from other perspectives. It was a fun time trying to pinpoint what kind of horror exactly will it turn out to be, because a multitude of threads are being introduced, previously mentioned elements of family dysfunction, multiple traumas, then religion, depression, schizophrenia, isolation and deprivation of what makes human comfort. I truly believe that the atmosphere is unimpeachable if you let it, ""bleak"" is a word I consider a win if justifyingly applied to a movie I've watched, and ""The Lodge"" has a level of bleakness that can get to you. However, the weakness I mentioned is that the directors and writers seem to have put so much ambition, effort and creativity in it that in the end there were too many balls to juggle - that's how I can describe it. If that sounds too complimentary, on some of the chosen themes the depth was lost or abandoned, a level of detail might've been serving only the atmosphere and imagery and in certain areas it'd look like perhaps conscious style>substance decisions were made. As someone who likes to review movies, I often see the various perspectives, some of which are hard for me to understand, but what is being called empty by some is often the excessive use of atmosphere building, which I often take for great horror entertainment in the same way we take gore, violence, action.I think it's fair to say that arthouse horror movies, movies anchored by atmosphere, movies of ambiguous nature sometimes have problems with concluding themselves. The ending of ""The Lodge"" is likely one of the parts that bother viewers the most - it was for me. There are so many open pathways throughout the film that the final point of them all doesn't really do justice, if even makes a portion of those paths seem absurd. It's never awesome when a movie drops the proverbial mic right before credits start rolling, but having said that I find myself very forgiving. It is a popular fact now, for example, that the ending of ""Hereditary"" was its weakest point, and while I do agree, it'd seem I'm incapable of reducing the value of all that came before it.What cannot not get talked about are also the performances, production design and the technical level of ""The Lodge"". Leading up to performances, I can also say that there might be couple minor character writing flaws. Despite having so little (count of) characters, some could say they lack additional exploration and, hmm, background information, though personally I found that there is a history for some of them that reads outside of the screen. The acting is top tier, the trio of Martell, McHugh and Keough present performances as scary as the movie itself, it never ceases to amaze me how child actors pull off such a range of emotion. As it is actually a relatively consistent characteristic of an arthouse horror movie, the aesthetical side of things of ""The Lodge"" is just extremely well done. Cinematography utilizes a variety of tricks, wide spaces, peculiar angles, effective use of darkness, and the color grading (and original score!) vibes on the same wave with the bleakness and creepiness that's found in the movie's plot. It made complete sense when I later learned who the cinematographer was - Thimios Bakatakis, a frequent collaborator of Yorgos Lanthimos, who has visually striking and often uncannily clean-looking movies, and whose horror movie ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" fits right in the genre I've been talking about.For me, ""The Lodge"" is another step towards what I wish was occupying more theoretical space in the horror genre. It's a serious, atmospherically and emotionally rich, thought provoking, and crazy good looking niche of movies. Apart from all the 'kicks' I get out of movies like this one, they have also have provided a lot of brainfood, and perhaps even something that can help me in my own life. It was after ""Hereditary"" when I couldn't calm down about it for a week, because there were multiple themes and notions that I could cross translate in my own experiences. Horror movies have been one of the few things in this life that have been proven to be of help, for over 15 years now. In the words of director Mick Garris: ""To me, the most effective horror is the horror that you feel and that hurts, and it doesn't just gross you out, but it hits you in the heart and the brain as well.""I'm excited for the next project by Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz - I hear it's going to be a thriller about refugees on a ship. My rating: 8/10.",The Lodge

It was amazing to see Alicia Silverstone in this. It was kind of a shocking change of pace for her, especially after not seeing her for so long. The children really did a great job in this film as well, maintaining the somber tone.This movie has one of the best setups I have seen for a psychological horror film in a long time. The first half hour sets the viewer up for absolute disaster, and, well, what do you think happens? When the movie was over, I left feeling SHOOK! I felt so uneasy, literally a bit shaky!

83,Mike_Devine,"Snow, ice and family drama",6,8 June 2020,"Late 2010s horror featured some very chilling films. From 'Midsommar' to 'Hereditary' to 'The Witch,' there were plenty of original stories that each delivered scares in unique ways. In 2019's 'The Lodge,' we are taken on a psychological journey through the lives of a broken family that must learn to get along...or not...during whiteout conditions in a creaky old mountain cabin.The frigid wilderness on display in 'Lodge' is nothing compared to the icy rapport between Riley Keough's Grace and her fiance's two children (played by Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh). The distrust between the kids and this new ""imposter"" fuels the events of the film, which take us through a few different possible explanations for the events unfolding onscreen. Keough manages to make all of this feel uncomfortably real.'Lodge' does a convincing job of faking us all out. Just when it seems like we know what's going on, there's a new question or doubt that's raised. We see plenty of breadcrumbs that lead to the eventual climax, but nothing is ever quite certain.

91,flicklover,Bleak and very unsettling.,9,23 February 2020,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film last year but it opened with such little marketing that I had thought I missed it. It was still playing at one theater where i live. I had read some good things but I hadn't noticed any buzz. What I can say is that The Lodge in one of the bleakest, most unsettling films I have seen in a long time. It is being marketed as a horror film and I guess that it belongs in the genre but it is more a psychological thriller than a horror film.It is about a father that takes his 2 kids to a cabin in the mountains to have a Christmas vacation along with his fiance. The kids obviously have issues with her from the beginning, and has her own issues. The film is not a typical cookie cutter horror film with jump scares. This film has a very sense of dread and tragedy throughout its runtime, it is one of those films that builds tension very slowly. The pace is slow but the tension builds constantly, it is very unsettling. To call it a thriller isn't accurate I guess because it's not edge of your seat but you get a very nervous feeling watching it. The shots are very long and you see things out of the corner of your eye that are very creepy.The performances are top notch. Especially by lia MRiley Keough. She plays Grace, the fiance that has a past that she is having trouble dealing with. The kids are also played very well by Jaedon Martell and Lia McHugh. The majority of the film takes place in the lodge with Grace and the 2 kids getting to know each other. The father played by Richard Armitage. He really isn't the focus of the story. He leaves the kids with Grace and leaves to go to work in the city. The midpoint of the film is about Grace trying to get along with the kids who resent her because she is going to marry their father. The film is very dark visually, bleak, gray and the characters are trapped in the lodge and strange things start to happen. I don't give spoilers but the films final act is really intense. The dread is just dialed up so.much that it feels uncomfortable. This film takes it time, with no cheap pay offs.When watching The Lodge I was reminded very much of Hereditary. That film also was very bleak and the sense of dread was very present. Both films are similar in that many shots include a view from the inside of doll houses. These shots are used to very creepy effect. Even though both are very similar in that they deal with family trauma, Hereditary goes from being very psychological and unsettling to flat out horror in the last act. The Lodge goes for a more consistent tone which I liked better. Hereditary is very good but it went of the rails towards the end. The Lodge is superior for that reason. It holds tension and dread without dramatic tone changes. It is the best film of it's kind I've seen in a long time.Grade: A-",The Lodge

93,Rendanlovell,What is this trying to be?,3,9 May 2020,"When it comes to Horror, I tend to lean into the ones that are built more on their atmosphere. I love when a horror movie can draw you in with a slow, atmospheric approach. Typically I steer away from loud, over the top jump fests with little substance or character. As for The Lodge, it's not quite either of these things. It's definitely more moody then loud but it can't seem to choose what it wants to be. You've got tons of loud jump scares but you also get long sequences of characters just wandering around doing nothing. Or, worse even, is the nightmare sequences that are so on the nose they hurt. Oh she's being dragged underwater by her cult father. She's feeling drowning by her past, I get it. Why do we need 10 more scenes reiterating the same point? The strange part about these things is that it wears its influences on its sleeve. Yet, it can't manage to break away from them or do anything they haven't already done. There's a spot where the characters watch The Thing which is a definite influence here. Not really knowing who someone is or what demons may be inside them is a clear theme here just like The Thing. However, the characters in that are rational and more or less likeable. The horror there is derived from a fear of the unknown. The horror here is nightmare sequences and fake outs. It isn't the best. In fact, it rarely lands. It just feels lost. The whole first half establishs this mentally unstable Riley Keough who has repressed religous memories. Her father was the leader of a cult and she is desperately trying to distance herself from that. That's the entire first half. Scene after scene of Riley trying her hardest to be ""normal"" for these kids who hate her because she isn't their mom. Which is a fine set up. After that is scene after scene of Riley getting more unhinged and finally snapping. There's definitely a message here about mental illness but I'm not sure what it is. Don't push sick people? I really don't know what it wants to say. The ending makes it even more confusing. I won't spoil it here but let's say there's big reveal near the end that makes literally every character unlikable. It's insane that a movie like this has no one that is relatable or even likeable. Plus, the ending hints at something extremely dark but doesn't even have the balls to go through with it. It sets up an incredibly bleak conclusion but cuts to credits before it happens. Making it feel like it cheated you out of the one thing it was building too.
At the end of the day, it's on the nose and dull. The production design and cinematography is amazing though. All the technical stuff is awesome, nothing else.",The Lodge
94,movieman6-413-929510,The Lodge copies elements from other films and doesn't come across as a own original film anymore.,3,8 February 2020,"The Lodge is a new thriller directed and partly written by Fiala and Veronica Franz, who have also directed the film Goodnight Mommy.In the film his brother Aidan (Jaeden Martell) and his sister Mia (Lia McHugh) traumatized after their mother committed suicide. Their father Richard (Richard Armitage) had already started a new relationship with the younger Grace (Riley Keough). He did this before he was officially divorced and so he left his old family behind. A few months after their mother's death, Richard decides to go to a remote chalet with his children and new girlfriend to celebrate Christmas together. Richard hopes that his children can get to know his new girlfriend and accept them in their lives. What Richard does not know is that his children have already done research online and know that Grace used to be a member of a separate cult. When Richard suddenly has to leave the three alone in the chalet, because he has to work, an uncomfortable atmosphere quickly develops between the three. The three are then also snowed in the chalet and end up without power and communication resources. The three traumatized characters are thus forced to work together to survive their situation, but the question remains whether they can trust each other.With this film the director duo tries to respond to the horror aspect of isolation and how this can drive people together or apart. In addition to these situations, it can also drive people crazy. These elements are also found in the classic horror film the Shining, of which if you put these two films next to each other a lesser copy seems to be. The characters in this film make separate choices just to pinch each other, making the film even more difficult to follow. In addition to the Shining, the film also copies elements from other horror films such as: Hereditary, the Others and the Strangers, so that it no longer really comes across as its own original film. As a viewer, you are stuck with an unclear long-winded film. As a film lover you also have to think more about the films that this film copies and you have more need to look back at one of these films at home in order to spend your time on a better and more entertaining film.The cast members of the film have also played better films in their careers where they all did better acting.",The Lodge

98,songod-95003,Two Troubled Kids and an Unstable Lady...,9,10 June 2020,"...walk into a bar...Seriously now...Dad is either completely selfish or entirely clueless. I can forgive the other characters their actions because they were motivated by either strong emotions or mental illness. But he, a psychologist no less, is unforgivably oblivious to the needs of his children suffering the devastating loss of their mother.Getting emotionally and sexually involved with a patient is never a good idea. I'd go so far as to say it could be construed as malpractice. But Richard (smoothly played by Richard Artmitage) goes head long into a relationship with disturbed Grace (a cult survivor exceptionally played by Riley Keough) which results in the suicide death of his still married to him wife (Alicia Silverstone in a short but effective role).A mere few months later, he decides it is a good idea to take his two children, both obviously very devastated by their moms death, and Grace to a remote lodge for Christmas. He thinks this will ""force bond them"" tho he never says that exactly. What school of psychology he comes from I do not know, but it is a bad one.Worse, he has to return to the city for work leaving the kids and the woman they blame for their mothers death alone for several days! Selfish oblivion combined with stupidity equals disaster.The kids (well played by Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh) and Grace do not bond. In fact, the kids have discovered via the internet all about her troubled past with the cult, her father (the cult leader), and how she was the only survivor of a mass suicide (so she could carry forth the message). Armed with this knowledge, the two conspire to push Grace to her emotional and psychological limits; without thinking of the consequences of being alone in a remote snowed in lodge with an unstable person.(My only issue with the film is that their gas-lighting is a little too good; as in it was a bit much to believe a 10 year old and a 15 year old (never says their ages) could pull off such a series of stunts. Once you accept that they could and did then everything will gel.)Even after Grace has obviously been broken, the kids do not let up. By the time they realize their terrible mistake and try and end the charade, it is too late. Grace is gone, back into her cult brainwashed mind, and not even Richard's timely return can bring her out of it.So far this is the best genre film I have seen this year. Nothing really compares.",The Lodge

I'm not sure I exhaled once, my mom is my movie watching buddy and also left me watching 70% I'd this alone. There were things I didn't like in this movie which was the violence and gruesomeness. (Is that a word? Using it anyway) I think people should be warned and know there is lots of suicide in this movie, starting right at the beginning and it made me very upset. It's also a constant theme in this movie. That was disturbing. And that was the point I suppose from the filmmakers because it is a horror movie. If you can take it for just a horror movie, it's utterly terrifying. I felt glimpses and similarities to Hereditary also which was an amazing movie.",The Lodge

103,TuesdayThe17th,The kids aren't alright,10,7 May 2020,"To me, this movie was great. Its just the type of horror film we needed to fill the void or absence of yet another ""Hereditary"" like film. Many of us drool over this kind of drama/horror movie. The dark, dark tone. The ominous and brooding dread. The isolation and the cold seeping through the screen... ""The Lodge"" is from the co-directors that brought us "" Goodnight Mommy"" which was good but very very predictable. ""The Lodge"" was also predictable but I liked the way they tried to teter on the edge of making us think one way or another. Their craft here wasn't hugely successful, but it stands out. This movie is merely made for a select audience. An audience like me that loves the dark ambience. As bizarre as it sounds, most Scorpios will probably love it while people of different astrological signs may not. This movie does feel almost too bleak but again, not every horror movie needs to feel the same. The script is pretty much a one way road. There was no room for deeper meaning here. No room for hidden background nuances or easter eggs. This movie kinda just ""is"". But that's okay with me because I like myself a deep dark drama/horror in a slightly similar vein of the best horror film of the last 45 years, ""Hereditary"", even if several elements were borrowed from it. ""The Lodge"" is genuinely scary if you ask me. Its that kind of deep seated unease that creeps up on us all as we watch the film, whether all of us admit it or not.",The Lodge

First off, it's far from original. It borrows heavily from several horror movies, most notably Hereditary. The similarities to Hereditary in this movie are undeniable: The doll house shots, the family tension, the dark lighting, the majority of the film taking place in a house, and the shocking but minimal graphic violence. The film also has a lot of elements that don't make sense. How did the kids pull all those crazy stunts to freak Grace out? Or was that all in her head? Or? Also, the teaser poster was incredibly misleading, showing an upside cross to hint Satanism. However, the film was very scary, well acted, shot skillfully, and always kept me on my toes.B",The Lodge

106,manuelasaez,"Bad. Such a bad, bad film.",2,9 May 2020,"I had such high hopes for this movie. The trailers gave the impression that it was a horror film, a home invasion movie or a movie about snow monsters terrorizing a family. What we got, however, was none of those things. We got a psychological thriller that thought it was as clever and well-made as superior films like Hereditary and Midsommar, but failed in every single regard.It starts off interestingly enough, and has all of the makings for an entertaining film. It borrows a little too heavily from Hereditary, (and let's face it, these people have a very high standard to meet). But then the movie devolved into nonsense where nothing is really explained, all possible avenues for the story get derailed and events just don't make the effort to make sense. The whole time, it tries to be a horror movie with nothing scary going on, a psychological thriller with nothing psychological going on, and a family drama with boring drama going on.Who was this movie made for and why? Fans of Hereditary already have super high standards when it comes to their horror films, so why did the people who made this think they could even compete? This movie ended up being the made for TV version of the horror movie it aimed to be. The worst part is, someone put this through screenings, and still released it. They knew they had a dud and didn't care. I just don't get it.So many things could have gone right with this movie; the cult could have come back to get the last member, the mother could have been a vengeful ghost, or even if they really were dead it would have made for at least an interesting twist. But this movie... it's just not good. Nothing about it will be remembered fondly, and it will be relegated to the top of a pile of movies with a huge sign that says ""Why?"".Avoid this movie because it's just plain bad.

114,eelen-seth,Isolation terror in times of quarantine - intoscreens.com,9,5 May 2020,"Who doesn't want to go to a remote lodge in winter to celebrate Christmas with the family?! Unless of course it's with your stepmom, who you don't necessarily have anything in common with. That's exactly what happens in Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz's newest film 'The Lodge'. After its premiere at Sundance over a year ago, it garnered mostly positive reviews and has finally landed on VOD for everyone to enjoy*.
(*""enjoy"" might not be the right word as you'll discover for yourself)This bone-chilling nightmare follows a family who retreat to their remote winter cabin over the holidays. When the father (The Hobbit's Richard Armitage) is forced to abruptly depart for work, he leaves his children, Aidan (IT's Jaeden Martell) and Mia (Lia McHugh - soon part of the MCU as one of the 'Eternals') in the care of his new girlfriend, Grace (Riley Keough). Isolated and alone, a blizzard traps them inside the lodge as terrifying events summon specters from Grace's dark past.You'd expect something like this from indie-horror powerhouse A24, but NEON has been growing their catalog significantly with titles such as ice skating drama 'I, Tonya' and this year's Oscar-juggernaut 'Parasite'. Not only does the film have that particular gritty low budget feel to it, it also delivers. Throughout the entire film there's this certain icy menacing doom hanging above the family's heads as we mentally and physically spiral down into the frigid gates of hell. The script is set up in such a way you'd question everything that happens in and around this cabin, surrounded by nothing but snow and ice. Nothing and no one can be trusted.Since this is mostly newfound mommy dearest Grace and her soon-to-be stepkids' vacation, they're all in each other's hair one way or another. The chemistry between these three feels perfectly ominous and threatening. Keough is quickly becoming an indie-queen, and once again proves she's ready for her serious breakthrough and become a household name. Her vulnerable performance of a woman that has been through hell from birth, makes you want to help her, well knowing there's another layer to her we can't exactly understand. This becomes clear when once again the film's genre turns itself from horror into more of a psychological mystery thriller.Sound is such an important part of 'The Lodge'. It sets the mood in many scenes, freezing your spine in a way you almost feel as if you were part of this little family holiday. Composer duo Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans' score contributes to this hair rising effect. What might disappoint is the very simple cinematography that doesn't do much for the story itself. We see a lot of the same wooden interior shots, without ever challenging itself in using interesting camera angles that could've lifted the atmosphere to unseen altitudes.The Lodge is easily as sharp as The Shining and Hereditary - both classics in their own territory. What differentiates this film from others is how imperfect it is, while none of it ever feels like an error. Isolation terror in times of quarantine.",The Lodge

The similarities to ""It comes at night"" are hard to miss and somehow that wasn't ""boring"". It was intense and gripping. This wasn't. It was slog that suddenly picks up in maybe the last 25 minutes. Not as in it moved slow and then ignited. Literally it felt like the film starts ""happening"" in the last 25 minutes.The film was always doing something, but it never really drives towards a conclusion. Early in the film a young woman and two kids are isolated in a cabin for, being honest here, sort of idiotic reasons. Its established both in the trailers and in the first few minutes that she's..not babysitter material. No reasoning adult would leave her with a pet, let alone kids.At any rate most of the film is spent insinuating a variety of things might be happening; it might be haunted, intruders, her being crazy, but none of it is particularly consistent. Like its not a similar but more intense thing that gets worse or scarier, just sorta throwing random ideas at you. A LOT of it is spent with the camera pointed a at dark corner while literally nothing happens. The last bit is mostly a cinematography issue. There's no..what I'd call..""color"" to the the camera pointed at nothing scenes. No sounds, or theme to it so even the most devout ""spooky horror"" fan and going to sit there and get frustrated after a while.Anyway, the cats let out of the bag in last 20-30 minutes and at that point I was just tired of watching the film.

Nothing paranormal or supernatural happens in the film. It's a film about grief and childhood trauma coming full circle.The acting of Riley Keough was absolutely perfect.

Directed by Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz. Written by Severin Fiala,Veronika Franz and Sergio CasciThe Lodge is a bit of a misnomer for this movie. It does take place in the middle of nowhere frozen wilderness all around them. But the lodge is no lodge. It is a massive two story home. It's certainly possible the title has another meaning that escaped me.The Lodge is about a man with his two children after their mother commits suicide due to divorce and probably some mental health issues as well decide to spend Christmas in this winter home with a new woman. This is such a shock to their system.It would be a shock to anyone's system. But this is no ordinary woman. This woman is someone their dad studied because of her past. She was part of a cult that killed themselves. She was the only survivor. She takes medication to help with the past. You will learn more about the Heaven's Gate cult she came from as the ghost of it lurks just out of frame in this movie. The trauma of that coupled with her new boyfriend leaving her by herself with these kids starts to weigh on her.This is a molasses moving picture. You spent all your time in this house. They lose power part way through so you're stuck with awkward feelings and anger and resentment bubbling up waiting to boil over. It just takes such a long time to get to the point you already know it's going to get to. The takes are slow and long. The house is silent. The people are just going through their motions. Their emotions are bottled up and everybody is afraid to let them out. This makes navigating a movie that is so predicated on internal thoughts and an internal life. It's difficult to get a movie like that to play.The performances are all fine. They do what is asked of them and try to create a believable human being and for the most part they do an okay job. There's just not enough there to occupy the viewer. You know where it's going way before it gets there and there's nothing there to keep you going. It's boring honestly. I have no issues with slow burn movies but there has to be something else to go along with it. You have to add character to it. We have to want to understand these people and that burn must be in service of something else.I can't recommend this movie to anyone. This was a slog which only had one thing right there at the end.

130,RMurray847,Slow and creepy. Takes no prisoners.,6,8 January 2021,"Richard is an investigative journalist (Richard Armitage) who tells his estranged wife (Alicia Silverstone) that he's going to marry Grace (Riley Keough), a young women who was the subject of his book about a cult that committed mass suicide. This message doesn't go over too well, and tragedy ensues. Next on Richard's list is a trip with his girlfriend, his openly hostile two children and himself to spend some time at his winter ""Lodge."" It's a big, rambling, totally uninvitingly dark house on the shore of a big, frozen uninvitingly grim lake. When Richard is called away from the lodge, leaving his two kids under the ""care"" of his young girlfriend...well, what could go wrong?Richard is quite a despicable guy. He makes one insensitive choice after another, and his cluelessness and selfishness lead from one bad incident to another. As portrayed by Richard Armitage, he's not exactly done a service as Armitage is not a terribly convincing actor. Hence, we really hate this character.Fortunately, the movie also has Keough, who gives her seemingly clueless character depth and pathos. When we get to understand her backstory a bit better, we begin to see her as a real, but flawed and maybe dangerous, person. Certainly not an ideal babysitter!Bad things start to happen when the snow closes in and the two kids are stuck with their ""adversary."" As sympathetic as Keough makes here, we also wonder at her stability. And the kids, who we can't help but feel bad for, are hardly innocent little munchkins. The natural elements combine with these two opposing forces to drive some disturbing outcomes. I don't want to say more about the specifics...but I can say that this is a deeply creepy movie. It builds a pretty palpable sense of dread, and it keeps the viewer somewhat unbalanced too, as our allegiances are constantly shifted. It's a slow film, so if you need fast pacing to keep you interested, you may struggle here. But as an exercise in tone, it's very successful.As with many ""horror"" movies (I use the term pretty loosely here), the ending leaves a bit to be desired, although it does, at least, wrap things up. Armitage is a significant weakness (half a star), but the atmosphere and the work of Keough make this very worthwhile.(When I saw this was done by the same folks who did GOODNIGHT MOMMY...I wasn't surprised. If you have seen that German exercise in dread and boundary crossing, you'll have a good idea of how THE LODGE plays.)",The Lodge
131,mvike,This is all that happens..,2,1 July 2020,"Before those, ""you just need gore and blood"" people reply...no I don't.This movie was absolutely dull, and stupid. It was trying to be so deep but ended up being idiotic. The best part was watching them watch THE THING...except that movie was a masterpiece, this was just a piece...and I usually loooove movies about people stranded in one location...that's my favorite style.Let's break down the key points and why they happened.1) Mother commits suicide over divorce, why and how is she THIS distraught, as it's assumed she's EXTREMELY religious...yet kills herself over divorce and leaves her two kids. Why? PLOT NEEDS IT...?2) Kids blame the new girl for moms death. Why? PLOT NEEDS IT?3) Dad KNOWS fiancé was the only survivor of a CULT that all committed suicide, appears to have NO CLUE she has obvious mental issues or is taking pills lolol. Okay...4) Grace seems to have a disdain for religion, why? Never says, we are to just assume she resents her childhood??5) Grace has sleep walking episodes where she does crazy stuff. Why? Never find out, just assumed she's nuts? Why? Idk? Plot needs it?6) PLOT TWIST: Kids are trying to mess with the mind of a woman who they believe is a ""psycho""...good idea...they convince her they're all dead... why...? Cuz they don't like her...lol. That's a great prank to pull on a woman they literally call ""psycho""...GOOD GAME.7) Kids prank causes Grace to snap and have some kind of psychotic break..? Are we supposed to believe people can actually be in a cult, then recover, but then be able to snap and lose ALL trace of sanity? I don't think that's how cult members work...they're DEVOTED...not INSANE.8) Dad gets shot in the head, and then it's assumed Grace also kills kids...the end.
Not one of these 8 events makes any sense, is scary in ANY WAY, or even slightly believable (save for MAYBE the Mother's suicide but given her religious stance and two young kids...it seems pretty unlikely)If you're wondering:No demons.No ghosts.NO, Mom does not make a ""angelic"" return in anyway.No, Graces issues or past are never explained even on a basic level. All we know is she was in a cult as a child.What was the point of the doll/dollhouse scenes? Who knows?How did Aiden create a legit looking obituary..? How did he fake his hanging? Maybe he drew up the obit at home..ok fine, but still when you see it...it's pretty unlikely a 13-14 yr old made that lol.How on EARTH did this get a 6.0!?!? This is absolutely NOT horror.

138,TheCasualReviewer,Wtf Richard!,6,9 October 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Richard (Richard Armitage) thinks it would be a good idea to spend Christmas at their remote Lodge so his fiancé, Grace (Riley Keough) and his two kids Aiden (Jaedon Martell) and Mia (Lia McHugh) could form a bond. What starts as childish pranks, quickly escalates to something much more serious and dark.REVIEW:
What is it about people having this fondness for remote cabins and such in the harshest of weather that screams comfort and relaxation for them? I'm just not that breed I guess.I'm stuck with this film. On one hand, I truly truly appreciate the screenplay from Veronika Franz, Sergio Casci and Severin Fiala, but I felt a dryness with the film. It's definitely a slow burn and there's little bits here and there that kept my interest, but I the twist of the film was very minimal and then the climax was predictable, which is usually the other way around. I have no issue with all of it being unpredictable (is actually prefer that in most cases), but when I was able to predict the outcome, it knocked the film a couple points for me. Probably the biggest reason as to why I didn't LOVE this film is because the situation felt so easily avoidable that it was hard to believe anything that happened. There's one huge bit of information you find out near the beginning that causes you to question Richard's intentions and for me it comes off incredibly unrealistic.With that being said, if you're good at suspending all disbelief then I feel you could walk away loving this film. Unfortunately for me, although I didn't hate the film, couldn't get to that point. 6.2/10.",The Lodge

There are no jump scares but I would prefer an intriguing story to jump scares and shallow story line.

Saying anything more would be a spoiler. But I would say its definitely a worth watching movie.

It feels like the terrible epidemic of Ouija board movies (The Conjuring series, The Nun, Anabelle, The sequels to Insidious) is sort of past us and the horror genre is recovering!
1) Brilliant settings, mood and shots. You'll get a ""classic"" horror film vibe from it as it largely shuns the usual mainstream tropes. More ""The Shining"" than ""The Conjuring"".
2) The story has enough in it to keep you interested and thankfully is devoid of the ""something terrible happened 86 years earlier in this haunted house"" B.S that has been overdone to death.

145,MK_Ultra_,"Good film, weighed down a bit.",7,29 April 2020,"I liked the film. Enough so to rank it a decent 7.It's slow buildup through the character buildup was actually important to the second act. The tropes within a psychological ""horror"" film lean heavily on isolation, mental illness, religion/cult---the film makes those parallels clear throughout, leaving you wondering where you are with these entering the third/final act. Reality is skewed enough to put you in one of three places with where the films ultimately culminates. Where you are when this happens, whether it bored, or dug in with the atmospheres and possibilities is where you have the differing of opinions in user/critic reviews. The second act premise is actually where I preferred it to stay---in a purgatory-like story arc. Where it goes from there weighs it down in a bit of plot contrivance that seemed misplaced, when the recipe for a better written third act could've (and should've) taken this into a realm of Kubrick's isolation v madness ala The Shining or any of Asters recent output that is not only that much more thought provoking, but just works.I had a vision of where it was going and it went another way, which personally was just a bit more satisfying than the actual result---recommended regardless, as a director team that made a solid film on their own terms and was entertaining.",The Lodge

I think only a few things were actually the kids doing after they drugged Grace with the sleeping pills, everything else was her delusion caused by non-medicating and revived trauma.

There only seem to be a few high quality horror movies release each year, and this is it!Upon watching, I quickly noticed that film seemed like a cousin of the great ""Hereditary"", however, I think it deserves it's own mention. The acting was extremely effective, conveying strong emotions that draw you in to the characters struggles and enhance the story. The cinematography was fantastic including wide pan camera shots that make you feel isolated and eerie ""between scene shots"" that make normal things (a crucifix, a painting, doorways, ballons, staircase, etc.) seem unnerving. Even the architecture of the various buildings in the movie seemed insidious. Pair this with a somber and sinister musical score, and you have success!The only critque I have is that the pace was a little bit slow, but I don't think it detracted from the movie too much. This movie was meant to be slow-paced and my patience was rewarded with a gripping story.I highly recommend this movie and I am glad I watched it! 7/10",The Lodge

Now, sometimes a slow character development is great, but in this movie it just drew me away with the slowness and super-dark or super-bright imagery. By the time it got to the conclusion I really didn't care much for any of the characters.Some other points that made this movie less enjoyable for me were the plot holes and just general things that are quite unbelievable. In short - kids can't clean that well after themselves, and if they can, they are adult enough not to put themselves in such peril.

155,jdiz115,I've lost all hope in modern movies,5,19 May 2020,"First off this is more of a psychological horror film. I actually liked everything about this film. The premise, the mood, the setting, and acting are all great. However, I have to judge this film as a whole. And as a whole it just doesn't work. The last 3rd of the film just gets more and more ridiculous until we're of course left with an aimless ambiguous ending.This film thinks it's smart when it's really ridiculous. We're to believe that 2 kids set up this extremely elaborate hoax to drive this woman mad. Then there's the whole thing with the kids finding out about her past which turns out to be a red herring. But from that sequence you're led to believe this woman is ""cursed"" or is some sort of ""witch"". I'm fine with misdirection the audience if there's a payoff but there's simply no payoff here. I did like the supernatural or crazy aspect of the film; but even after it's revealed it's the kids, I still wonder how the kids could possibly come up with this plan that intricately incorporates her past without so much as showing how they could know so much about her psychological damage besides reading one article about her. Also, the gun scene is flat out ridiculous. This woman barely has a grip on the revolver and father doesn't try to snatch it away and the son doesn't get the gun after his dad is shot like what???? I don't care what any reviewer says you cannot factually argue the ridiculous last 3rd of this film. I don't know it had potential but at this point I've lost hope in modern films.",The Lodge

Yes they do have quite a bit in common, but the actual plots are very very different. That is not to say I think this movie is perfect, there are quite a lot of things I did not like, especially plot wise.There are a lot of people also saying it's a watered down Ari Aster movie. I love Ari Asters style of deep and complex storytelling. but not every single movie has to follow that format. A lot of the negative reviews (not all of them, there are a lot with genuine criticism) are either saying they wish it went deeper into the horror aspect in an Ari Aster way, or that it's too similar to Ari Asters style.This is definitely a slow burn movie, saying that it is just boring is a huge exaggeration.

175,thomasmitilis1995,REPENT...,6,5 May 2020,"PROS:
~Riley Keough gives an impressive performance and captures perfectly the character of Grace, a vulnerable woman who had a tragic experience as a member of a religious cult and tries to adjust in a more normal environment.
~Jaeden Martel and Lia Mchugh give solid performances as the kids.
~The film illustrates perfectly the fragility of mental health. It's easy for humans with a tragic past like Grace to collapse again when they are put under pression.
~The film is slow-paced but it succeeds in establishing the characters and the interaction between Grace and the kids is intense and stunning.
~The mystery is well established and until the final act you have many questions (the missing things, the photograph that shows that the characters are dead etc.)
~The dollhouse metaphor works in a smart and subtle way as a foreshadowing for what about to happen (specifically what is the plan of the kinds from the beginning). However, even if you think you pull the strings behind a stituation, it's very easy to loose control.
~Alicia Silverstone's scene is shockingly unexpected.
~The cinematography is beautiful and the production design is amazing.
~The music score creates a creepy atmosphere.CONS:
~The twist is forced. Sure, children can be harsh when they hate someone but in the case of this movie they lead their stepmom literally into madness. They, actually, understand that their prank is horrible but they don't do anything about it even if they have many chances throughout the movie. In other words, the movie never manages to establish that they are so sick beacause of their trauma in order to attempt something so horrendous.

The tone of this movie is very unsettling and gets under your skin and just makes you so uncomfortable in so many ways. The acting in this movie was amazing and each member of the cast blew me away with there acting abilities but the main stand out here was Riley keough who gives an extremely haunting performance that complete blew me away. The score in this movie is easily one of the most haunting scores I have heard in a while and it easily helps play into the creepy and unsettling nature of this movie. The movie is also beautifully shot and directed.

177,goodellaa,Beautifully crafted horror.,8,1 March 2020,"My only possible criticism of this finely crafted and uncompromising horror tale is that the third act seems slow at first. It kind of makes sense though to put the audience right in with the characters, trapped in an weird situation with seemingly no hope of escape. Gave me too much time to think. So who do they think will enjoy a movie like this? Fans of good cinema art and some fright film fans. Some will turn on the lights and walk out of the room, saying, ""This is boring, who wants a beer?"" Know why? They are scared. Don't be hard on them. Pretty ladies being chased through the woods by special effects to a rock soundtrack are absent and this movie really is not for everyone. The ""jump scares"" are few and tastefully done. The audience has ample opportunity to scare itself, but not always. There really is something strange and awful creeping toward you in this movie. Well written. Well acted. Well photographed. Nothing does not feel real. Everything good.

Also, for someone as religious as Alicia Silverstone's character, mother of two young children, to kill herself without hesitation is quite difficult to believe. If she would have struggled with the decision, contemplated, cried, gone back and forth, etc. prior to killing herself, then okay, it seems plausible, but she literally killed herself from one second to the next. Religious people strongly believe that if you commit suicide, you go to Hell. There's even a scene in where the daughter is crying because her mom is not going to heaven.

189,TheJediWay9,Starts Strong But Then Falls Flat,5,21 February 2020,"THE LODGE is a psychological horror film about a family, torn apart by tragedy, that decide to spend Christmas at their remote lodge in New England by a lake. Tagging along is the girlfriend of the father, Grace, and the longer everyone stays at the cabin, the more and more suspicious things seem to become.This is a movie that is very well directed. The directors are able to get the most of their actors, cashing in on beautiful camerawork involving a loot of zooms that captures the emotions and the complexities the characters are feeling in that current moment. The cinematography is great here as well, as we get a very snowy landscape that is able to capture just how cold and isolated this lodge and these characters are in this situation.All of the performances in this movie are great. Riley Keough is the standout here, giving a very subtle, quiet performance for a good chunk of the movie, and she is able to play a complex character who is harboring past pain and trauma very well, and is able to express the psychosis of said character immaculately. It's also nice to see Richard Armitage back in a movie. I don't think I've seen him in anything since THE HOBBIT trilogy.The atmosphere is captured very well. The movie, while slow and perhaps a bit drawn out in some scenes, immediately makes you feel unsettled and disturbed. Right away, from the opening the movie is building to something and when a startling event happens within the first ten minutes or so, that atmosphere is elevated and the directors are able to craft a spooky, haunting, and disturbing tale that keeps you intrigued and wondering what will happen next.This movie falls apart for me with a reveal that is essentially undone by another reveal. This second plot twists doesn't feel all that earned, as we are led to believe the first plot twist is something that actually happened and it made the movie more interesting, it opened up some questions, it never had answers right away, but then that second twist ruins almost everything. The movie came to a screeching halt with that reveal and I felt it was a cop out.This movie is also very similar to other horror movies as well. The two major similarities are THE SHINING and HEREDITARY. Essentially this is the same movie as THE SHINING, with aded elements from HEREDITARY mixed in, one of those elements involving a dollhouse. I found these similarities to be very distracting, especially the similarity to THE SHINING. It felt as if they wanted to remake THE SHINING but didn't have Stephen King's approval or the studio's approval and decided to make a soft remake anyways. Even the way the camera moves with its zoom ins and zoom outs reminded me of Kubrick's style of filming and evoked a lot of shots that were done masterfully in THE SHINING rather than here.All in all, this movie was a very mixed bag for me. It started strong but wasn't able to stick the landing and lacked a lot of originality to the point where it felt like other films, better films, that have been made.I'll say you'll probably like THE LODGE if you have a half bucket of popcorn.",The Lodge

206,awfulketchup,A Nosedive into Psychosis,7,7 June 2020,"This is the first time I've seen this movie, i jumped into it blindly, without any spoilers or opinions to warp my perception of how to think or feel about seeing this. And I'm happy to have caught up on this film. So where to start? Well, this is a psychological horror movie about a father of two kids, a boy and a girl. During a divorce, his ex-fiance (I'm assuming) didn't take it too well and things took a complete 180 from there, I'm going to have to spoil some of it to give my perspective and why i enjoyed it.Now the thing that made this movie effective is the same thing as i can say about another film which this reminded me of, namely ''Hereditary'' where that movie was mostly about grief, illness, tragedy, family, this movie on the other hand seem to focus on beliefs and psychosis (I hope I'm not misinterpreting it) Let me explain, so in this movie we have Grace, the new stepmother, who is arguable the protagonist whilst the kids act as the antagonist, but the roles switch around on the later portion of the film. The reason why i I'm deducting this to be true is because from the start of the movie we are handed with clues, valuable clues that validates my statement. These clues are the gun the now dead wife used in the beginning and Mia's quote ''Mom won't go to heaven'' Because suicide won't give you a free ticket to heaven, you'll be stuck in limbo instead until you repent.And since the kids discovered that Grace used to be part of a religious cult of some kind, this could be seen as blasphemy, but consider that in the movie during the time where she stays in the house, she uses pills which probably got prescribed to her, we do not get to know what kind of pills they are but i am willing to bet that they are to help her recover from the trauma, so she isn't completely out of it, she's just sick and she is trying to get better. What the kids were essentially doing was to escalate her condition until it spiraled out of control, but it went too far. This is where Grace's psychosis comes into question. A lot of her behaviors seemed to fit the description.Or maybe I'm just reading too deep into this and the kids actually were the true evil in the cabin/house, and they drove Grace from a recovering sensitive woman into a delusional, god fearing person. I mean seriously, two kids pull a elaborate plan for what? Revenge? Or was it with good intentions? I Just can't wrap my head around it, but one thing is for sure, i genuinely felt bad for Grace.Ok half asses analysis over, I'm giving it a 7/10, have a good night!",The Lodge
207,jg_1977,A great concept dragged down by poor writing,6,21 February 2020,"The Lodge is the latest entry in the trend of horror-dramas, like Hereditary, The Babadook, and It Follows, which are light on jump scares and more concerned with telling a compelling human-story that slowly builds up the tension to a powerful climax. However, unlike its predecessors, I think that The Lodge muddles the story that the horror is built around. The core concept is a solid, classic set-up: a group of characters with conflicting interests are trapped in an isolated place and pushed to the brink of their sanity until all hell breaks loose. But the film failed at sucking me in and getting me invested in the characters, which dulled the impact when the horrific events began happening. The biggest culprit is how the main character of Grace was written. Despite having a compelling backstory, I never felt like I knew what her wants, needs, and weaknesses were, which resulted in her coming off as a lifeless shell who the plot happened to, not because of. I think with stronger and clearer characterization, Grace would have made a very sympathetic protagonist that I wouldn't want bad things to happen to, allowing the horror to be more effective. Additionally, the dialogue in parts felt very clunky and unnatural, possibly stemming from being written by non-English speaking screenwriters. Ultimately, by the end of the movie, my suspension-of-disbelief was completely broken, so no matter how well-executed the horror was, I was disengaged and just waiting for the movie to end. Which is a real shame, because the movie does have some clever and impressive horror sequences that would really hit home if the writing had been on par. My advice would be to wait for this one to become available digitally and to skip it in theaters. It's worth a watch for horror die-hards but not at the full price of a ticket.",The Lodge

I love movies like The Lodge and Hereditary that don't constantly use jumpscares and just make me linger with tension because of an unnerving ambience. And I used The Lodge and Hereditary as examples because unfortunately this will be compared to Hereditary due to visual sequences because there is a dollhouse, a funeral, and a grieving moment. There is also another house near the isolated area throughout one scene of the movie, but after watching this I found that other house to be unnecessary.

That the same things have been done over and over again that it's basically the same cinema regurgitated. But oh, we have been wronged.This movie sets a precedent of it being a slow-burn as Hereditary. Fun-fact is that this film's idea was made before Hereditary and there has been a feud among Sun-dance critics that it's been plagiarized. Nobody knows but for damn-sure both are significantly different in many ways.I hate spoiling everything but allow me to say that Keough is phenomenal in this flick. We are given so much about this actress' character, and we are fed these beliefs that each character has a dark side when we aren't really given the full picture.The plot goes as this; The family experiences a traumatic death and the family wishes to move on and spend a holiday at a lodge in the alps of Massachusetts. Not all of the family is there nor are they mentally prepared to be together when a family member has been deceased six months ago. There is tension throughout the film and it's given to us slowly. In fact, when the film was being produced they did it chronologically so the actors could feel the ""slow-burn"" happen so that it would benefit their authentic personalities going in.This movie is a blast. It's very original and everyone acting did their part to make a very unnerving film. It has dark religious themes but it doesn't offend them, just the dark (let's say, extremist which doesn't eliminate the religion entirely) side of beliefs.

Things do get out of hand for them but part of that was the mental weakness of the adults. I groaned when the woman reached for her pills because I knew that some form of delusions would now serve as a convenient writer's crutch - anything goes bc she's crazy! To add depth the sound person plucked some appropriately discordant string notes but eventually I got tired of hearing them. The father largely vanished for a great deal of the plot, seemingly nonchalant that he hadn't heard from the adult looking after his kids for what seemed to be a couple of days out in a blizzard. The writers ask us to overlook a Lot of things along the way to their allegedly clever ending.

228,sstetsko,Worth my wait!/?,7,18 May 2020,"I had to wait for a while to see this, and during my wait, urged on by generally positive reviews, my anticipation built. That may have done me something of a disservice, because had I gone in with no expectations I would likely have been very impressed and may have given it an 8(.5) (which in my books is very high praise indeed). As it is, having too long to wait made me be less impressed, making me tempted to give it a 6 (still good by my reckoning... I am not prone to gush over movies-- when you have seen as many as I have (horror and sci fi in particular (numbering well into the thousands) you get pretty high standards). I have decided that, in fairness with maybe a touch of generosity, it deserves a solid 7 at least... definitely one of the better horror flicks to come out of the year.The strength of the film lies in the directing acting, and cinematography, all of which come together to convey a nice feeling of desperation and claustrophobia, lending validity to the plight of the characters. One sequence in particular (without giving too much away) where the lead lady goes out into the blizzard to seek help, was, to me, pretty exceptional, while many other scenes outlining the wearing down of the lead character also stood out as merit worthy. You would think with these solid performances and artistic choices my first anticipated 8.5 would be warranted, but the movie is not without problems. The main problem with the movie lies in the premise itself.The theme is a struggle with sanity, and we are given some key background to lend plausibility to the lead's plight, but it doesn't really seem like it is enough to justify what happens to be honest... not for the given time frame in which the story elapses. Also, the cause of the dilemma... the conflict with the children (again struggling to not give anything away), seems rather implausible in how it plays out-- or rather in how far it goes. But I can forgive these things. It can be difficult to give all the background needed for a story to be fully plausibly explained... you are after all making a movie not a full biographical series. In the end the only thing I had a problem with was just that-- the end. It isn't the outcome I struggle with... it is the delivery of it. It seemed... hurried and somewhat underdone for the build up. Overall a very worthwhile movie, but that ending just left me...So I am not sure if my wait and anticipation did me a disservice, or if it allowed me to more objectively see what I might have missed had I seen it while the expectations were absent. In the end I have no regrets about having watched it. It deserves credit, and if you enjoy an atmospheric movie about isolation and the stress that brings, then this will definitely be at least a 7 for you too.",The Lodge

Its atmosphericly dreary with an excellent setting and location that helps the story progress slowly to its climax.

234,salmon62,Another self-indulgent borefest,3,7 May 2020,"There is nothing scary or tense or redeeming about this film. It appears that the cinematographer got on location early, took thousands of minutes of the wood paneled interior of a remodeled country home, some drone shots of the snowy countryside, then left to allow someone else to construct a film around his shots.
There's simply "" No there, there""! This film attempts to make an extremely unlikely plot and family circumstance perfectly normal.No one ever is the sole survivor of a cult suicide and then resumes a normal life with a man documenting the event and starts a new family as though nothing had happened. Things like this don't happen.
The religious overtones don't build suspense or terror, and the plot twist goes largely unnoticed because the family easily resumes their daily routine. I didn't even find it to be a twist it was done so poorly.And why is ""cabin fever"" suggested as a horror plot when people are asked to go on Christmas break and stay together for three days? Right now in the US we're coming up on two months of ""Safer at Home"" strategy and have nothing like this movie dramatizes over a weekend!

It seems many people overanalyzes things like the script and I think it prevents them from immerse themselves in the story and atmosphere. I also think that people not used to European (the directors are Austrian) movies can have a harder time to get into it.
I would describe the movie as ""funny games"" without the social commentary. It's not as good as funny games but still very good. You get a similar feeling when you watch it.
The directors previous film ""goodnight mommy"" is also great and I think I like that movie a bit more.To summarize:

While those that build atmosphere and tension such as this title are called ""boring and nonsensical"". As a charitable fan of all things horror I can appreciate everything this genre encompasses if it's executed decently. Maybe not so much when it comes to slashers and torture features.The Lodge is a slow burner that sets an unnerving mood pretty effectively. There is a trail of breadcrumbs that although was initially slightly puzzling had the effect to keep my interest peaked right until the twist. The movie weaves ideas such as grief, resentment and trauma into a very good guessing game. Yes, it's been done before but in my opinion this time around felt better. Maybe it was because of the acting, which I really enjoyed, perhaps the choice of setting even. Or maybe due to how the pieces of the puzzle weren't made to fall into place neither forcefully nor conveniently. My biggest surprise was that the twist reveal, which happened after roughly 2 thirds of the movie, wasn't the only payoff. Instead the movie added a karmic resolution on top, that although unsettling, made absolute sense. I honestly don't know what the angry reviewers watched but they might want to keep the insults towards the directors of this movie to a minimum if they can't be objective. As for parallels to other films, honestly besides minimal similarities to Goodnight Mommy (same directors after all) I couldn't see anything else. There is also the whole ""entertain multiple possibilities until the reveal"" type of storytelling that I previously mentioned. Another theme The Lodge explores is the dark side of religion that could have contributed to, in my opinion, the unfairly low rating of this movie.For me The Lodge hit the spot with its creepy atmosphere, bleak overtones and the subdued but true to the situation way of acting.

But, there's nothing I would consider to be actually scary about it, at least not in the popcorn throwing hide under your covers kind of way.I would say its along the same lines of stories like The Shining, The Turning, or even Oculus. It makes you question the reality of what you're seeing and some movies do really well with that. For me, The Lodge didn't quite hit the nail on the head but it got close.The almost suffocating feeling of total isolation is what really sells this movie for me. I think that they did a fantastic job creating an uneasy, tense and inescapable atmosphere.I usually appreciate movies that capitalize on the slow burn subtleties of horror. But, I think this movie would've been better if there had been more action...more of a fight for survival but then have it ultimately end the way it did in the first place.

Sadly, that is just not what we end up with.
Maybe I just don't ""get it"", which could very well be the case after reading these raving reviews here. The movie felt like it never got started. I kept waiting for some kind of reveal but there isn't one. I just have so many questions. Too many.
We know she was in a cult and still has some kind of psychological attachment to it but why? Her father haunts her but again, why? She was the only survivor...why? Is that why she's obsessed with repenting? Did her mind never truly leave the cult that we know next to nothing about? What's with the shack she stumbles upon and keeps staring at? Where did all their stuff go? How did she get the photo she later finds in the snow with the flowers? Where did the paper with their deaths come from? What triggered this for her in the cabin?
The back story is just not enough. I compare it to The Shining because it has a similar premise of being isolated in the snow and slowly losing your sanity. But this one doesn't give that claustrophobic feeling when it should do exactly that. The movie was just so tedious and disjointed. Very little build up to an obvious ending.",The Lodge

It's always good to have an horror movie with no jump scares and a complex pot.It's due to that complex plot that half the movie just looks the inverse of a dramatic comedy, developing the characters under a tense situation of 2 kids not wanting to get closer to the girlfriend of their divorced father, getting it even harder after their mother suicides when knowing they were gonna marry.When we had already forgotten this is an horror movie, finally the plot starts, and that's when it gets pretty good. We don't know what's really happening, and under confuse clues we follow the characters as they try to understand what's happening in the house and if they are dead or alive.Sadly, the ending is among the worst I had seen. It should have told if she kills the kids, or they flee, or they stop her. It shouldn't have left for us to imagine.That other house Grace finds, showing a guy inside, also made no sense at all and not explaining it just broke the movie's logic.

253,Skeauxsha,Looks like this Movie touched a nerve for some viewers,9,30 July 2020,"Having seen the preview, I was ready for a good tense creep-out. That's exactly what I got.
For the first few minutes of the movie I thought I'd made a mistake, or missed something, however, once Laura made it home after having a bomb-shell dropped on her that all changed. First layer.
As the family attempted to adjust, it was clear that Richard wasn't focused enough on his priorities. Second layer.
Mia and Aiden sensed something was just not, quite, right these days as the situation went from bad to no hope bad. Third Layer.
Enter Grace. A young lady that didn't get a good life start in her very early years, and experienced trauma on a level only reserved for the truly bizarre. Fourth Layer.
If you paid close attention you could pick up on the hint of a trail the director's left, however, they were setting you up for a twist that will leave your jaw dropped.
There's a pall over the entire film insinuating one (or in this case three) that should not mess with the fates, because they will come, and bring Karma with them. With that, this film sets an unnerving mood. The Lodge hit the spot with its creepy atmosphere, bleak overtones and the subtle but true way of acting to the situation .
I genuinely don't know what the angry reviewers saw, but to be fair folks keep the insults towards the directors of this movie to a minimum if you can't be non-partisan.

This one keeps you guessing as to what is happening most of the way through, it builds the tension expertly and the atmospherics, camera angles and creepy decor in the lodge are done very well.

This movie starts well, sets up the story well and then falls flat so hard it's like taking the popcorn out of the oven as soon as one pops - it smells nice, but in reality you're left with only hard, tasteless kernels.Let's address the elephant in the room. This is NOT an intelligent movie. However, it does have enough pretentious cinematography to make some people think it is. That being said I am a fan of said cinematography AS A SET UP, but not as your entire substance. I have no idea why some people are calling this innovative as it simply isn't. Long drawn out shots of a darkened empty hallway or a window while someone frantically plucks at an untuned violin and radio-filtered whispers is neither ground-breaking not original. Yes, it's uncomfortable so overdoing it will elicit an emotional reaction, which some people mistake for the effect of good writing.Now, beyond the elephant. The story goes absolutely nowhere. If the movie is original with anything it's that the ending is so mediocre and so little attempt has been made to make it interesting that it's a rarity in the genre. If you know there is no twist ending you can guess the finish a good 15 minutes after the word go. The characters are profoundly unlikable aside from the dad, who appears briefly at the beginning and the end. There is ""creepy"" scenes which go nowhere and have absolutely no explanation, nor do they contribute to the plot (I am looking at you 100 snow angels).That being said I do appreciate movies which try to at least get part of the equation right and this one, as stated above, has a good first part. Now, if only movie-makers learned that you need to know how to finish a story too. So, while I wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend it, if you're into eating only the first couple of popcorns of the bunch and being disappointed by the rest, go for it. Just be warned - the moment you start asking yourself ""ok so where is this all going"" is the moment when you know the movie is well past its peak"".",The Lodge

276,lincolnhawk-87377,"The ""Twist"" Lodges in my Throat",3,19 August 2020,"I understand that these days horror movies apparently must have a massive ""twist"", mandatory, must-have, got it. My issue is that the twist needs to be at least somewhat sold to me; you can't just throw one in there and not put any work into making it palatable, somewhat believable. To not do so is just lazy and insulting. The writers get to say, ""they won't see THIS coming!"", but I say well, of course we don't, because it is completely unbelievable. I understand the concept of suspension of belief in movies, but there must be a limit. The twist you are supposed to swallow without spitting it right back out is that basically this child, the son (I don't know how old he is supposed to be, he looks around 14 or so) is a psychological puppet master, capable of orchestrating an incredibly elaborate and complex premeditated act of psychological warfare on the ""stepmother"" who, as far as I understand he has never actually met. I cannot swallow this. Even if I could swallow THAT (which I cannot), if this child IS capable of Hannibal Lecter-calibre mind-manipulating genius, why would he risk putting his sister's life in danger as a consequence of such behaviour? If he is smart enough to carry out such a plan, surely he is smart enough to see the danger of driving a mentally unstable, grown woman insane in an isolated cabin in the middle of nowhere in the dead of winter? And that is without breaking it down further; the levels of premeditation and planning required to take the movie to where it ultimately goes is just ludicrous. Having the kids sit whispering in front of the dollhouse while they move the dolls around and then packing some strange items in their bags pre-trip just doesn't cut it as adequate backstory to sell the twist. ""Oh, but remember, they were planning out the different scenarios using the dollhouse - they had it all figured out. And don't forget, they packed some candles and a framed photograph, we laid the groundwork, the twist is justified"". No. Nowhere near acceptable. Then you add in all the other contrivances. The father, despite being a trained psychiatrist/psychologist who actually TREATED the ""stepmother"", fully aware of her history, mental state and the medications she is on, decides that leaving her alone in an isolated cabin with his young children - who she has never met - at Christmas, 6 months after their mother blew her brains out all over the dining room wall is a good idea. Oh, and with access to a gun. That he shows her how to use, before realising she is in fact extremely competent with handguns, unloading the gun into a tree one-handed, Dirty Harry-style. Blatant, inexplicable misdirection slopped on to unnecessarily disguise a twist that nobody should be able to spot coming as it is absolutely ridiculous in nature, like the dog ominously growling at night, doors creaking open by themselves. Listing all the plot contrivances and the sheer intricacy of the children's plan is unnecessary, suffice it to say, the twist just isn't plausible on any level and as a result ruins the movie as soon as it is ""revealed"". The actual look of the movie was fine, well-shot, atmospheric, the acting was solid all round, but again, for me, all the good is spoiled by the ludicrous twist. It always surprises me how such behaviour doesn't bother so many people, many reviewers giving such movies 10 stars, completely ignoring the fact that they have been insulted in order for the writers to feel clever with their fancy ""twists"". At the other end of the spectrum, the 1 star reviews complain that the movie was trying to be ""The Shining"" or ""Hereditary"". This was not the issue, the issue was the indigestible twist. I spit this back in the writers' faces, not eating it, no thanks.",The Lodge

A slow burn for sure but does the build up pay off? I'm not quite sure...The true standout for this film is its atmosphere. The icy cold seclusion really immerses you and adds so much to the tension, especially for the first half of the film. Unfortunately I think the script leaves a lot to be desired for in its mid to final act and that's where things kind of fell apart for me. Some questions were left unanswered, the main character progressively lost her intrigue and the films ""twist"" came as expected but made no effort to arrive with some sort of presence.

278,priyadarshanmaity98,Cold blooded darkness.,7,30 April 2020,"We are witnessing horror renaissance of the new decade after the shocking discoveries of hereditary and midsommar and heartfelt allegorical babadook now we are again discovering another horror which is not quite horror more of a pshycological thriller with horror elements. This new type of movies really subverting the audience expectations about how to take the horror in a new direction, you never really know where the movie will end. The lodge is the kind of horror that keeps you guessing throughout the second act, and the twist which is predictable but knowing the circumstances of the end makes you uncomfortable. Veronica Franz and Severin fiala's second directorial effort is a gut punch of a film which will hit you directly. It's a indie horror in its full glory. The aforementioned sentence about hitting you will fizzle out in the middle but still it holds you right through the end. The cinematography is exemplary in its depiction of close quatered and even expansive interiors in glorious long and establishing shots you get the sense that something is off about the house because how the Dop handles the lighting it's creepy. The direction never changes the tone it is balanced evenly throughout the duration. The slowburn approach will be self indulging for the viewers even for me but wait for it the message will surely make you think. Is it possible to bury the past trauma or will it again return and if it is returning what will you do? And the trauma of the present time can really make someone lose his/her innonence is the questions you will be having while watching the movie. Riley Keough is mastering the mysterious characters she potrays, very brilliant act and the two kids the it movie famous actor Jaeden Martell has come a long way and his portrayal of a troubled kid is brilliantly realized and her little sister Lia McHugh ably supported him. The film sometimes drags and it will feel like it is not going anywhere but still wait for it, the broodiness will surely hold you.

Those are important elements, but without more character development and things actually happening, it's not enough and a slow burn ends up being boring. Until the last 20 minutes of the film, when it all goes down.HERE COME THE SPOILERS. I'm going to give up the twist, so if you don't want to know, stop.

283,heyitskeane,We're all stuck in this house ... I mean cinema.,7,15 February 2020,"The Lodge, directed by Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, starring Riley Keough, Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh, is ... alright. I wouldn't go as far to say it's the next best thing, but it has it's moments.The film is directed beautifully by Franz and Fiala, and it's worth mentioning the on-point cinematography by Thimios Bakatakis. The performances are good all-around by the entire cast, but (as most have mentioned) Riley Keough once again steals the show.I did greatly appreciate the creative, unconventional scares in the movie, unlike the predictable, cheap whip-pan jump scares in most horror movies these days. It was quite the relief that The Lodge was one of those better horror flicks. The movie was also amazing at building an extremely haunting atmosphere, which was possibly the best aspect of the film.The plot itself was rather creative. I have to say, it was original, different and entirely believable. It was something that could very much occur and I have to give credit for that. There were also times where the film blurred the lines between reality and visions. At times, you just wouldn't know which was actually happening and not some prolonged dream.My biggest flaw with the movie was that it built this great haunting and chilling atmosphere but it never fully capitalises on it. The film could have gone in a few different directions which could have given a full pay-off to all the suspense and thrills it built. However, it took a more subtle, slower direction which was honestly a let down.Also, the first act could've been a bit quicker in terms of pace. There were some scenes that dragged a tiny bit. It doesn't ruin anything, it's just a bit slow.But then, maybe all those flaws were entirely intentional by the filmmakers. Who knows?Other than that, The Lodge had some quality moments. But it eventually, unfortunately, fell short of it's reach.",The Lodge

The shots in this movie were pretty good, but I didn't expect it to be so dull the entire time. The mood and lighting of the film was dark and blue. I clearly see why they did so, because it really set an eerie mood for the viewers. But it got to the point sometimes where I just felt uncomfortable or maybe they forgot to add lighting. Some of the cinematography was good, like some of the outside shots.
Some people may get confused at the ending or even the plot in general. I know I had to explain it to my friend. But it's not too confusing.
I was definitely expecting something different when I saw this though. The plot twist wasn't what I thought and it was played off well. But I guess since I had such high hopes for this film, it didn't rise to my expectations as much as I wish it would have.

As another reviewer here said, I did not feel good at the end of this film. Horror is usually cathartic but this was like being plunged into a depressive state, along with the lead actress.Better writing and tightening, and a far stronger narrative might have aided the story, but as it is, nah.

The cinematography is breathtaking, and Riley Keough's performance is unbelievable. Like ""Mommy"" the central characters are two siblings who are up against some sort of unknown/unstable maternal presence while existing in isolation. Instead of a vast, lonely European farm, ""The Lodge"" features exactly what the title suggests -- a mountain lodge in the middle of nowhere. It's so well done that you can almost feel the icy frost in the theater as the film progresses.Franz & Fiala take a lot of cues from Ari Aster, ESPECIALLY ""Midsommar,"" in depicting sudden tragedy and brutal, existential grief that consistently drips off the screen. Additionally, there are underlying themes of mental illness and psychosis that are done really well and tactfully -- although I might add it may not seem so at first. Sorry if that's cryptic, I just don't want to give any spoilers. The ending will knock you on your ass. I couldn't move after the screening, I was frozen for half the credit roll, and couldn't stop thinking about it for days.I highly recommend ""The Lodge"" for fans of Aster's work, or if you liked ""Goodnight Mommy"" and want more of the same slow-burn insanity.",The Lodge

This is a masterful film which takes its time in building up the suspense and dread that builds up to a shocking finale. If you have a short attention span and/or a taste for cheap slasher horror, this will not be your cup of tea.A man is raising two young children, a boy and a girl, after his soon-to-be-ex wife commits suicide because he's leaving her. The suicide scene is utterly shocking. Alicia Silverstone, although her part in the movie is very brief, does a fantastic job in this role.The man has a younger girlfriend who, predictably, the kids hate.In a foolish attempt to get the girlfriend and kids to bond, he leaves the three of them alone at a remote cabin for several days while he leaves for work. What could go wrong, right?The two brats devise a horrible and elaborate prank to play on the already mentally fragile woman, and keep at it even when they see that the woman's psyche is starting to break.The prank ties in to the woman's extremely troubled childhood, in which she was the only surviving member of a suicide cult.Eventually the kids realize they've pushed the woman too far, and attempt to stop the prank, but at that point, it's too late, as the woman has had a complete psychological breakdown, and a chain of increasingly shocking events is set in motion.Riley Keough is FANTASTIC in this role, she carries the movie.Visually, the movie is absolutely stunning.I won't give away the ending, just watch this and you can thank me later.

I was sympathetic towards the father mostly, sometimes Grace, and sometimes the kids, but overall, i felt frustrated with them. Grace's character was the most interesting but her backstory wasn't explored enough. I felt compassion for Silverstone's character, too. Great start to the film!Storyline: premise was cool. The movie lacked normality for me. These people are odd. On the other hand, it's refreshing not to see the conventional stepmother trying to win the kids over by being friendly in a corny way. Grace isn't someone I'd warm to if I were stuck in a cabin with her. So, the narrative is interesting, but i think other elements of the film make it dark, slightly dull at times, and off. I thought the twist, if you can call it that, was good. I said in my head ""you gotta be kidding me"". It made me frustrated a little.I didn't like how dark the film is. More lighting was needed. I didn't like the cinematography for the most part, sometimes it was very effective. I prefer films with more close up shots and dialogue I can relate to. These characters felt very foreign to me, except for good ol' Dad, who's only in the film for 20 minutes at the start and 10 at the end.There's a few instances in the film where the ambiguity felt pointless. It seemed to be included to confuse the audience, and even when the film was over, I was left unsatisfied with any possible interpretation of the strange occurrences.Acting was great!

Copy and paste score, dollhouse, the shots, the opening of the movie, the point blank, no emotion impulse suicide, it's all too derivative.

I thought the plot was feasible, although knowing how nasty children can be, I was glad that this writer / director didn't shy away from giving these two nasty brats exactly what they deserved.

318,Eric1485,The Lodge,8,10 April 2020,"The Lodge is a bleak psychological thriller, that explores the emotional and mental impacts resulting from traumatic situations.Directors/Writers Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz do a terrific job of controlling the tense atmosphere in every scene, never allowing the viewer to get comfortable; it is as if something terrible is lurking within the shadows, just waiting for the perfect moment to reveal itself.The cinematography of Thimios Bakatakis is absolutely stunning as the setting of the house and snow become characters themselves; with skillfull, claustrophobic shots of the interior, juxtaposed with the spacious snow covered fields, which feel just as restricting as the house. Bakatakis is also the Cinematographer for great films such as The Lobster, Dogtooth, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer.The acting was solid throughout the cast but I do want to mention the performances of Riley Keough, and Lia McHugh. Riley's performance was impressive and a vital part of the success of the film.

321,sbash22,"Slow burner, fantastic visuals, good acting, let down only by a weak story",6,15 March 2021,"Amazing cinematography, directing and stellar acting but, after the shocking moment early on, it becomes quite the slow burner with nothing much of substance happening for a large chunk of the movie. Although there is a steady build up of tension which is handled expertly throughout, the ultimate payoff is sadly disappointing.The story is unfortunately the main issue with this one. It depends on certain religious tropes, while at the same time mixing it up with more inventive elements concerning the activity of the children, but because of the religious tropes, the movie struggles to escape the ""seen it all before"" category since some of the horror scenes in particular are concerning religious cliches and those scenes are probably handled most poorly by the two directors.It's as if the directors are fantastically skilled at slowly building up the tension but when it comes to conveying the actual moments of true horror that's where the weaknesses are revealed. The tension building is the scary part, but the horror moments much less so. The voice of the cult leader, intended to be scary, sounds more like it belongs in a comedy rather than a horror. Of all the great voice actors out there I don't know why they opted for that voice - it certainly didn't have the desired effect of creating terror.The explanation behind the activity of the children and their connection to the events could have been handled better and in more detail, when the time came. Because of the slow pace, when it got to just over an hour into the movie I did start to lose a bit of patience with it because of no significant events happening for such a long while.. but fortunately I managed to persist with it.After some consideration though I'll say this movie is still definitely worth a watch for horror fans who don't mind a slow burner, because of the overall excellent directing, the commendable acting by the entire cast (especially the young girl) and, last but not least, the amazing cinematography which itself is of an extremely high caliber for the most part. and perhaps the crown jewel of the entire production. The visuals are exquisitely done.I'll give this one a 6. It's good but not as good as it could have been with a better story and a slightly quicker pace.",The Lodge

They laud it as intense, thought provoking, shocking, well shot.Negative reviews seem to come from people who want your more average pacing and less obtuse storytelling, and they're calling the film boring as hell with no story at all.Neither camp is totally right.It's slow paced even for ""elevated"" horror, to the point where it becomes obvious runtime padding. There's not enough story here for an hour and fifty minutes, not even for an art-house film. Even ""elevated"" fans should be able to see that. But there is, in fact, a story that is being told, and you'd think the naysayers would be able to see that.The setup is superb and has just enough of a unique spin on it to make you wonder where they're gonna go with it. The problem is that they hinged the plot on something entirely absurd that nobody, regardless of age, would ever do to the extent that is portrayed.

332,Dispatcher3033,Quickie Review of The Lodge,6,7 February 2021,"Post-horror is a hard sub-genre to get right. Balancing all the necessary elements is no simple feat. ""The Lodge"" almost got it but not quite. While the acting is great and the production value (sets, lighting, sound design..etc) are really good, the story is where my main issues come in. It's a ""slow burn"" but it's so slow that the payoff just feels hollow and once you know the twist there isn't much of a rewatch value to it. While many would possibly compare this film to the amazing film ""Hereditary,"" which it does feel like that at times, I got a strong vibe of ""Goodnight Mommy"" which makes sense since the directors wrote and directed that film as well. It also didn't help that a couple parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious breaking the tension for me. I feel a better ending coupled with better pacing would've made this an amazing film. As it stands, though, I can only recommend this if you're into the sub-genre or a fan of the director's previous works. I'm giving ""The Lodge"" a 6 out of 10, it's closer to a 5 than a 7.",The Lodge

344,metaCity,Intelligent psychological thriller,6,11 June 2020,"This is an enigmatic film that reveals itself slowly. It makes no allowance for audience impatience, telling its story sparingly. The film's impact is delivered through its atmosphere and themes - claustrophobia, religiosity, the dead hands of the past clutching at all its characters until the weight of the past becomes so heavy the film slows down to an insane and lifeless end.
The story is simple enough, superficially, but gets a lot deeper and darker as past events are revealed. Richard and Laura are getting divorced and Richard intends to marry his new partner, Grace. On hearing this, Laura kills herself. Six months later, Richard suggests to his two children, Aidan, a teenager, and Mia, slightly younger, that they spend Christmas together with Grace at the family lodge, up in the mountains.
Grace is the sole survivor of a mass suicide carried out by a cult led by her father. Richard met her while researching a book on cults. He left his wife for Grace and now wants them all to bond. The children are not impressed and begin working on a scheme they hope will get rid of Grace. They research Grace's past online and discover the story of the mass suicide. A whole back story comes into view here that culminated in Laura shooting herself, and we realise that this story is really the sequel to an earlier story. This is intelligent script work, getting our imagination working as a complicated past is revealed through events rather than an exposition dump. Alicia Silverstone is outstanding in the opening, making a real impact as a woman in despair, victim of an earlier story that ends just as the film begins.
This is all in the first 20 minutes, before Grace even appears on screen. She is a difficult character. Emotionally distant, we are kept away from her at first, she appears in the background until introduced to the children, and us. She relies on pills, the trauma of her past still inhabits her and will finally take over under the pressure of the children's cruel scheme. Riley Keough plays Grace perfectly, especially when the breakdown occurs, her dead-eyed fatalism is genuinely disturbing as she suffers the realisation that she has been dead inside for many, many years.
Aidan and Mia suffer a realisation too, that children shouldn't play with dead things. Lia McHugh and Jaeden Martell act convincingly throughout, as the children go from sullen to scheming to terrified, trapped in an isolated lodge with an insane adult.
The Lodge is well directed and scripted. Dialogue is sparse, none of the characters have much to say to each other so tension is generated through contrasts - the garishly bright church windows at Laura's funeral, the journey from the airy, bright modernist box Richard and Grace live in to the dark, wooden lodge the represents Richard and Laura's life together - and symbolism - the early connection of religious symbolism and a gun, the overbearing icons at the lodge, the frozen wasteland surrounding the lodge representing Grace's internal state. She can no more walk away from her surroundings than she can walk away from the emptiness inside herself. In the end she has to turn around and go back, to the lodge and to her past.
This a tense, subtle film with a story that stretches back beyond its beginning. Grace's mental decay is well portrayed by Riley Keough. The direction and screenplay are economical and focused on maintaining an atmosphere of low-key dread right up to the final disturbing scene.",The Lodge

Now, why the name of my review has the word 'cruelty'? Those two kids were truly cruel.

Although it isn't your typical horror packed with jump scares, it is able to still make you feel the intense horrors within this Lodge. The use of cinematography throughout this film is what makes it feel Claustrophobic giving the idea of it all being set in a doll house.Usually I feel the idea of religion being used in horror films is overdone however this movie uses religion in a way to make you feel uncertain and unsafe about everything that is going on throughout.The reason I gave this movie a 9 rather than a 10 is because I wanted more from the ending.

I usually can watch even low rated movies.this one was not one of them, the ratings are pretty high and i found it very hard to watch. The main thing that bothers me is the dad who is a suposedly expert in cults crimes and end up with the girl who was part of a sec where a mass murder took place and leaves her alone with his children in a remote place and gives her a gun..... this is almost a way to ask life to get rid of your children. and im not even talking about the fact that she obviously acts like a crazy person and he doesnt even seem to realize it, she doesnt even seem like a loveable person in the first place.I am sorry this is the only thing in my review and this is the only thing that made this movie hard to keep watching after the first 30 minutes.",The Lodge

The scenes are shot to fill you with tension and suspense, the sounds bring you to the edge of your seat. The actors are convincing beyond a doubt.If you wanted something classically ""scary"" this may not be what you want to see.

If you don't mind slow films (i don't) then it will be perfect for you because it is not boring at all.Fathers are split, the husband tells her wife (still) that he needs to sign the divorce papers because he is going to marry with another woman. The wife can't stand it, so she kills herself. Kids are devastated.Six months later, the father plans a small vacation out of town to a lodge in the middle of the woods (while a snow storm is about to hit) so his kids can get to know better this new girlfriend. They refuse but he manage to convince them and that's where the story begins.You can feel the tension since the very first minutes. The camera angles are claustrophobic, shots are really close and you almost feel trapped inside the movie. The cinematography and art overall is outstanding. It reminded me a lot of Kubrick movies, specially The Shining.I loved every minute of it. I was trying to guess what was going to happen next and even though i more or less knew where they trying to go to, it kept surprising me with little plot twists.Can't say more about the film without spoiling it, but it was literally one of the best thrillers i've seen in the past couple of years.

378,horrorbladesreviews,This entire production is a sin to the horror genre.,4,8 July 2020,"""Repent your sins"" is the most commonly used phrase throughout this film and it's something that the directors need to consider doing themselves. This entire production is a sin to the horror genre. I went into this one after hearing mostly positive reviews from critics, a 6.0 on IMDB had me hopeful for what, on paper, sounded like an interesting flick. Instead, I was met with a vastly disappointing, boring and irritating disaster that only gets worse as time goes by.The Lodge starts off promisingly, in fact, the strongest and most shocking scene takes place in the introductory 15 minutes of the movie. After this, it's only downhill as the film progresses.Every single character annoyed me in this production, which is rare to feel in any movie. You have the father who deserves the worst father of the year award for leaving his two children alone. Mia who spends much of the two-hour-long feature crying. Aiden who spends the majority of the production emotionless and who may just be the biggest psychopath of all. Finally, you have Grace who I neither rooted for nor rooted against, due to the neutral and confusing nature of the film.There are many plot holes and a lot of questions you'll be asking yourself throughout. There isn't enough twists to save this film as it progresses either. If you have any common sense, you'll be able to predict the key plot points as they unfold. A lot of it just doesn't make sense and there's a lot of scenes that add zero value to the story. The pacing alone is enough to make you want to sleep.After an hour through this one, I found myself wishing for it to end as I imagined the conclusion would at least make up for the rest of the movie. Oh, how wrong I was. The ending 'The Lodge"" is superiorly weak and doesn't make sitting through the rest worth it at all.",The Lodge

That being said, even with strict attention, the movie is confusing at times, perhaps intentionally so. The sense of dread is very strong throughout the movie, and the great set is a big contributor to the movie's atmosphere. That cabin is freaky!

They dropped the ball with that one because I...disliked the father... right away. Why? Because. One of the very first scenes is the children's biological mother dropping them off and she looks like she's just given up on life. Which it turns out she has because their divorce isn't even finalized and he tells her he's marrying another woman. So what does she do? Spoiler she commits suicide and the kids are more then a bit resentful of dear old dad and I can't say I blame them because his actions throughout the film are completely reprehensible and I would've cut all ties after what he'd done. So the children tell him, upon learning of his intention to marry Grace, that they don't want to go on vacation with her a measly six months after their mother commit suicide and the father insists upon it any way. To the surprise of absolutely no one, things go terribly, terribly wrong when the children take their revenge and it goes too far. Were the children wrong for doing what they did? Yes. Was the father a selfish, careless, imbecile who deserved what ended up happening to him for putting them in this situation? Yes. I say put the blame where it belongs.

From the very beginning of the film, there is no time wasted in bringing on the shock and unsettling atmosphere and feel. As the film goes on, the atmosphere slowly but effectively builds up tension and dread like no other film I've seen in recent years. The sets do a fantastic job of creating a feeling of claustrophobia. Really adding to the tension of the movie. I left the theater with this film being impressed into my mind for hours to come.

Against their will. The twist is decently spooky in a make-your-skin-crawl type of way but honestly just makes the boy child seem like a bit of a sociopath.

Perhaps editors didn't have enough options to cut long sequences of boredom. Now certainly one understands the concept of building emotion and feeling by immersion in the scenes, but so many opportunities seemed missed, and there was so much horror that could have been included in the first 60 to 70% of the movie that just wasn't.

It was a very well thought-out plot that plays off of many different psychological themes that continue throughout the story and help wrap-up the ending. There is a large amount of irony with what the kids do and what happens in the end, so rethink it a bit if you are acting like you know quality films more than everyone else.Sorry for the rant, but people trying to act like they know the genre but don't understand plot styles, story motivations, themes, and suspenseful build-up and then say this was boring just need to just shut up. Anyways, the movie did have it's down parts, and you have to question how kids would pull off some of the after-life hijinks. Still it had a great build-up, enough back-story to help you understand both characters motives and there was certainly enough suspense and tone to the movie to make you feel uncomfortable (which is an accomplishment in my book).I watch a lot of horror/thrillers and often predict the ending about half-way through. This one I did not. There are few movies that at the end I turn it off and say WTF! and yet think it was a good movie. This was one of them.If you want something with a bunch of blood and guts, mutilating people and jump scares, then go watch an entertainment horror.

If you are an emotional or religious person, this film will most certainly make you cry. Sorrow is tied to fear wonderfully in this film. If you've been through divorce or watched someone else go through a divorce, this film will hit you hard as it's scarily real. I see some reviews saying this is Light Hereditary, and to that I disagree. This film has it's own unique character dynamics and beautiful camerawork. The isolation is real! It does share some similarities but I enjoy both for different reasons. This film will divide critics and horror fans alike. The ending is not too satisfying depending on your take, be warned.

456,Mickytankbank,Its slow but creepy,8,4 May 2020,"This review was a little difficult to complete. Not because of quality of the movie, but it is hard to talk about without spoiling the experience. So, this will be the most careful treading I will do in hopes of convincing you dear reader to watch this movie.
This suspenseful, tense, drama filled story will have you gripping at the edge of your seat as you experience one of the oddest weekends at the lodge upstate. Now, I must warn you, this movie is a slow start, and some scenes are a little long but this works in conjunction with the tone of the movie.
The movie starts off in the middle of a divorce. An awkward, almost silent car ride to the father's house suggest that no one is happy with the situation. The silence only interrupted by slides towards the father's new wife. A few awkward conversations, more silence, and a failed attempt to make peace between the kids and Grace (the new stepmother), it is decided that the weekend will be spent at the lodge. I do not name the father because he is barely in the movie save to give the kids and grace the reason to be at the same location. Father goes to work, leaving the kids and grace alone with something darker.
This movie does an excellent job at creating tension. The sterile silence that slinks around the cabin, only to be interrupted by sounds of daily activity echo that the kids do not like the Grace. And this movie is incredibly quite. You hear them fidget with papers. You hear the sound of the drawers when while they are talking to each other because conversations are forced and quiet. Add this to the fact that the lodge is on an isolated part of the lake and you have a creepy thriller that is creepy because of the elements that go into and not cheap jump scares. It proves that movie doesn't need to really on a scary monster, tons of blood, or a creepy cult to elicit fear.
If you have seen Hereditary and enjoyed it, watch this movie. Although I wouldn't consider this movie as horror, the suspense it builds is more than enough to have your heart pumping a little faster than it's used to. Despite it's slow start and some of the scenes taking forever, it does so much right. I definitely recommend this movie.",The Lodge

460,luke-andersun,Pretentious and Annoying,2,19 April 2021,"I really loved the cinematography for the film. Acting is great as well. It had a lot of potential.There seems to be this trend of reviewers who loved the film stating that people won't like it because it's ""too complex"" for them, or something to that effect ... honestly, if this is your first slow-burning psychological horror, then I'm sure you'll love it or at least think of it as a decent film. Unfortunately for this reviewer, I'm not impressed, and this is coming from a fan of slow-burning psychological horrors.This film is not a great work like Hereditary or Midsommar. And even those films are palatable enough for mainstream audiences to heavily enjoy, which is probably why they have done so well. But The Lodge is not palatable for audiences, mainstream or otherwise. It's slow-burning for the sake of being slow-burning. Not impressed by twists and turns either - I don't care if you pulled one over on me; I appreciate great stroytelling and solid character development over a twist, but unfortunately this movie relies on its twist to carry it.This film isn't smart or clever. It's not fun ride, or a good brain teaser. Don't listen to the people who are easily impressed because they couldn't figure out the twist, unless you are that type of person ... I just think that's setting the bar really low. If you are looking for something slow-burning and of the psychological horror variety, I would suggest a different film like Hereditary, It Follows, Midsommar, Rosemary's Baby, etc. But you've probably already seen those.If you haven't, I highly recommend checking those movies out over this one, because this movie ain't it.",The Lodge

The kids go up with their father to spend a couple days alone with their soon-to-be stepmother. Things happen and things start to get worse as you would imagine, except there is this whole religious twist to the movie that I felt unfair to Christianity. They are basically calling Christianity a cult when occult would usually not be singing traditional hymns and they would usually be reading from something other than the Bible. That aside, I felt like they took that storyline way too far. There's a lot of dead space in this movie. It's an hour and 45 minutes long but it felt like two and a half hours.

I can't believe so many bad reviews? I find that younger viewers don't enjoy horror films that make you feel dread or build dark sense of mood. To do that In a film takes time to get to know characters and developing a story. It's definitely not for anyone with a short attention span that needs a jump scare every 5 mins to keep your attention. I feel films like The Lodge and Midsommar are the new school of horror films that keep you thinking long after the credits roll. It's a style that's definitely not for everyone.

The abstract atmosphere and slow tempo were a bit tedious, to be honest, but they made the plot twist all the more surprising, so points for that. The overall narrative idea was very good, but I was left with a feeling that it could've been developed much better. And, of course, absolutely no humour or any change of mood in this horror movie.

The concept of the dolls house and the lingering shots of it are clearly stolen from 'Hereditary' which is extremely uncreative. The story is not really original and has some allusions to 'The Shining',The clip from the thing was a bit cheeky as well. The films plot has the feeling of an end of term assignment where the writers had to produce a film to pass a test, panicked and didn't know what direction to take the plot, before just about passing out of movie making college. The performances are very good particularly from the girl playing Mia. The reference to 'Joker' in the tag line was the monotonous, tedious pacing.

1. The real mom (played by the aging gracefully and still lovely Alicia Silverstone), commits suicide because her husband is about to divorce her. She leaves behind her two kids and her husband.
2. Husband's new girlfriend Grace, has mental health issues from her time in a death cult. She joins him and his two kids in their cabin for Christmas holiday.
3. Kids already know her history and think she's a psychopath. The two kids play a mean prank on the stepmom, hiding her stuff and her MEDICINE for her stress and anxiety. Kids further confuse her with crazy talk about nightmares and other unpleasant stuff.
4. Grace has mental breakdown, loses her mind, starts hearing voices and remembers her dark cult past. She kills her boyfriend with a gun, and kills his two kids cult-style.First 30 minutes was promising, has a dark ambiance, eerie tone, nice shots of an isolated winter wasteland. But it fails in execution.Main character Grace was poorly developed, she's a cliché: brainwashed by a cult but offered nothing new in characterization. Dialogue was confusing, was it trying to pull off a Sixth Sense-style build-up and ending? Plot was confusing also. Did the real mom's ghost instruct the kids to do the prank?

However, if you manage to stick with it till the end, I feel that the payoff is worth it. I was able to guess the ""twist"" about halfway through the movie, but was pleasantly surprised that it went even further in a direction that I wasn't expecting. The acting was superb with Riley Keough as the standout. In a film with not that many sympathetic characters, you kinda find yourself rooting for her.

""The Lodge"" is a reasonably well made horror movie, has all the typical makings of one - including a story that's pretty much put together of multiple familiarities, portions of ""Fright Night"", ""The Witch"", ""Rear Window"" (or ""Disturbia"", if You will), plus some body horror, and a kind of 80's feeling that seems to have stayed more of a goal than an achievement.

490,kajacobs-76432,Interesting Concept that falls flat due to clichés,6,25 July 2020,"So, I'm a big fan of Hereditary, and even though I had some grips with Ari Aster's second film Midsommar; I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. For reference, I have also seen VVitch, The Ritual, and any other movie in this genre where people seem to claim you need a high intellect to follow and understand. The movie is a psychological thriller with religious zealotry and mental illness to move the plot along. The film runs for an hour and 48 minutes, and once the hour mark had passed, I found myself checking several times to see how much more I had to subject myself too. If you're looking for a good movie to watch, I would pass this one. Spoilers below.The movie is a slow burn; however, the opening act catches your attention. A mother brings her two children to see their father and the younger daughter hints at the current situation by asking ""is she going to be there?"" So, you already know that this family has its troubles and there is another woman involved. Once the trio reaches the father's house, he dismisses his kids to talk to his wife privately. He mentions that he wants to finalize a divorce and marry a woman who (moving a bit ahead here) is the sole survival of a destructive cult whose members all died from suicide. This prompts the woman to end her own life. Sadly, this is the highlight of the movie and it is a slow descent to boredom afterwards.Six months later, the father wants his two children to spend Christmas alone with his soon to be wife. Understandably, the kids blame their father for their mother's death and show no interest in getting to know their soon-to-be stepmother. To add insult to injury, the son refers to her as a psychopath, but father of the year is having none of this.Instead, he decides to leave his fiancée (who is obviously hiding secrets from him) alone with kids in a cabin during the dead of winter. For reasons only the directors know, he decides to give this mentally unstable woman a weapon for As the story progresses, things begin to become unhinged and the descent to madness begins. At this point, the characters seem more like stock characters than actual human beings. Then the story begins to heavily rely on overused thriller/horror tropes where any avid/casual/ or even passing fan of the genre will be left pulling their hair out, yelling at the TV and wondering if the movie will have some ending that makes them at very least satisfied that they spent 2 hours of their life watching. Spoiler alert, it doesn't.The power in the house dies (because of course it does), their phones are dead (because of course they are), the fiancée loses her meds (because of course she does), and the children are frightened for their lives. Even more so when the woman comes up to the attic, where they're hiding from her, with a weapon in hand. Worst father of the returns, to find the woman's dog dead in its bed, and his frightened children behind the armed woman. He attempts to talk her into releasing the weapon, and she shoots him point blank. The children then run outside to their father's car and attempt to flee. However, the car won't start (because of reasons). Let's suspend disbelief here, that a man who owns a house and a cottage for winter vacations has car troubles. Anyway, when the children finally start the car, it's stuck in the snow, because once again, OF COURSE IT IS. What happens next is predictable.There, I just saved you 2 hours of your life. Ignore the pompous reviews.",The Lodge

I enjoyed the filming and staging in this movie, as it reminds me that you dont need a lot of flashy or expensive scenes to make a good movie.I find the most critical negative about this movie is that the beginning was a long process to the build up, which was short in return.The best part for me will remain the setting, filming and sceneries.

The movie starts off well, the acting is as good as expected, it's the story that fails somewhat on delivering what's promised: the horror. For almost 50min the main characters seem to be at some drama about ""what's happening here"", but the suspense never really hits us and the last scenes, and finally when it does, you'd expect it to have more horror action, like in Hereditary, or The Witch, or even A Quiet Place - which are movies it reminds us of, even psychologically, but once again it doesn't, the movie keeps its slow pace, it gets darker, but not as dark as people told us. For instance, The Invisible Man is suspenseful movie from beginning to end and it does what it promises. The Lodge had everything to do so, a family gets stranded in a deserted place, their things go missing... That's it, they talk, complain, seem to be going crazy, noises everywhere, no help, but putting myself in their places, I'd be a lot crazier. The idea of the movie is accomplished, that's why I liked it, but the ending of the movie could have gone differently, but I won't spoil that, it's the most obscure of it and it's the part where my heart felt that horror, still as I said there could have been a lot of scarier scenes in it.",The Lodge

The film keeps you guessing until the end, and the ending although not clear cut, ties the rest of the film up perfectly. Although a slow burner, no jump scare in sight, and may therefore seem boring to the thrill seeker amongst viewers, the storyline is interesting and moves along at a pace that keeps you glued to the screen and makes you want to find out where it's headed.
With elements of The Shining and The Others, it pays homage to some great classic cabin fever horror stories yet spins something very original in itself.

It's well acted and shot beautifully.As for flaws, the ideas are not always fleshed out well.

If I think about this movie being shorter than Hereditary I really wonder why it felt like I was watching a movie the length of The Green Mile.While the acting is good and the story promises a great premise, something about this movie just makes it feel like a drag that won't end.Towards the end it really just felt like a cinematography-heavy budget-""The Shining"" with minor adjustments.I wasn't happy with what they made of the story and how they treated the thrill-curve so loosely while not even sticking to a proper act-organization as the movie just jumps from semi-thrill to soaring stretch multiple times without any observable order.It is very well shot and the cinematography is great, but it can't make up for the lack of matter it displays.",The Lodge

Yes, I know everyone has their own opinions, but calling this film ""the worst horror movie ever"" seems to be stretching it just a bit. A movie doesn't have to be absolutely terrifying or full of jump scares to be a good horror film. This is personally one of my favorite movies right now; I went to the theater to see it twice. Riley Keough, Jaeden Martell, and Lia McHugh are all amazing actors and play their vastly different roles extremely well. The setting provides an eerie and claustrophobic feeling of desperation that truly adds to the tension between the characters themselves as well as their environment. The lodge itself and the stark land surrounding it are quite literally chilling. The plot and story go to great lengths to make sure the viewer is feeling just as hopeless as the characters themselves. By the end of the movie, there are a few unanswered questions, but not enough to make the film itself seem lacking or questionable in quality.

I mean, it's a well made movie visually. Everything is there, it has nice photography, nice directing (I guess), the actors nailed it (except the kids most of the time) and it had something going for it, beyond having strong looks it had a genuinely unique plot with lots of opportunities: death cult, isolation, good references, madness, tons of tense moments and strong atmosphere, but in the end is like they grabbed all I just said and tossed it into a blender because the overall movie felt so poorly put together.So many events which lead to nothing or mattered nothing. Every 20 minutes it felt like the movie was trying to build to something just to completely change or ignore it in the next transition. Did they develop the cult? No. Supernatural? Gone. The cabin in the middle of nowhere? Not a clue. Kids intentions? God knows. Most of the time I spent asking myself what is even this about since the movie felt like it was changing goals by the tick of clock. God, I didn't even know who the main character was supposed to be.Filmmakers, stablish what your movie is about them build towards it with scenes that have context. That's it.Overall it's a very mediocre movie, which doesn't mean it's bad but also doesn't mean it's good.

A few scenes and shots made zero sense, like it had nothing to do with the story line. And the whole time I kept watching my watch, I honestly wanted to get up and leave but my date insisted we stay because he was sure the ending would make up for everything. Well it did not.

550,Widmo_TV,Regrettably Undercooked,7,27 July 2020,"A perpetually clueless dad (who would want such an idiot for a husband, much less two women?) abandons his bitter children with his mentally fragile second wife-to-be, who the children are palpably disgusted by, in a spooky house on a frozen lake.
We feel for the children as we see the film primarily from their perspective at first, but quickly become more sympathetic to Grace, who is in charge of keeping them under control while being given a laughably cold shoulder by them. After a while, it becomes apparent the trio is under psychological attack, resurrecting old demons from Grace's traumatic childhood, but who is the culprit, and is it Grace herself?While not without its twists and turns, the hallucinations from Grace's traumatic childhood seem to represent only ""generic Christian cult."" The film could have benefitted from a better understanding of what makes cults unique and what made Grace's cult operate the way they did. As it stands, the visions of the cult leader haunting her fall flat, and lack any real menace.The film shines when we feel Grace is rising above this crappy situation, and becoming a hero, but then falls as we watch her rapid descent into a vegetable for the second half of the film. The kids alone can't carry the end of the film, especially being so unlikeable, and we care too much about Grace to enjoy seeing her lose her mind completely.All in all, where the film works on paper it works on screen, too, but the film squanders its premise with a super-basic series of revelations and resolution.A more intelligent father and more interesting cult would have enhanced the screenplay. Some of the ""psychological torture"" the trio endures is really silly, and literally including the gang watching scenes from John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" on the telly is about the most played-out, sledgehammer-over-the-head, way to drive home the paranoid themes of snowed-in-isolation in your film. Nevertheless, the film continually doubles down on this microcosmic symbolism with constant shots of brine shrimp the little girl maintains, and her random attachment to dolls (and the ability to create and update them on-the-fly), which are used as clunky stand-ins for the dioramas from Ari Aster's Hereditary, is never really explored in a meaningful manner, leaving the viewer to wonder if the directors and writers have ever actually spent any time with children, or just fear what they represent.",The Lodge

The children are believable actors and the father while a little weird he plans to remarry even though his children aren't ready, it still makes sense for his children and new wife to get along. The children then learn that their dad's new wife is the last remaining survivor of a suicide cult lead by her father. The children understandably are little weird out by this. They get to the lodge and the movie get a little weird. The power cuts off and everything in the house also the wife is hearing voices of her father. Near the end we find out the children were behind all along and at first I thought they were trying to make her commit suicide just like their old mom. But then they didn't want her to die and were just trying to scare her. This doesn't make sense at all, they knew she had a troubled past and was most likely psychologically damaged but still try to mess with her. I understand they're kids but the boy is around 15 years old and should have an understanding that she needs her pills which they keep away from her. And there were multiple times where it was obvious it wasn't right even before they bring up the idea that they were dead. In one scene the wife sleep walks and stands next to the boy's bed with a gun in her hand and proceeds to hit the girl with no emotion of any kind. This movie just makes no sense at all.",The Lodge

The doll house, the shocking death scenes, the music, the colors, everything but the story. And we could look past it if the story and execution were good but they were both a waste of time.I had the misfortune of having the plot ruined by a a reviewer here (""Children Can Be So Cruel"" was the title and completely gave the twist away). I almost didn't watch it because spoilers tend to take the fun away for me, but I really wanted to watch a new horror film so I just proceeded anyways. Big mistake.I have no idea which character I'm supposed to be rooting for. I felt sorry that the kids lost their mother in the beginning, but after seeing what a couple of psychopaths they turn out to be, I don't feel sorry for them in the slightest. In fact, it makes perfect sense why their mother would kill herself. Her husband hates her (which we NEVER get to see why) and her kids are sociopaths. Okay.Also why does the husband drive his mentally unstable ex-cult member girlfriend and his newly motherless kids who hate her guts to a remote house in the dead of winter just to leave them immediately?

563,sbowjacobs,Sufficiently Scary,8,9 May 2020,"I'd been immensely excited to see ""The Lodge"" when it first cropped up on my radar in late 2019 under a list of most anticipated horror movies for the coming year. Billed loosely as a horror in the vein of ""The Shining"" and ""Hereditary"", ""The Lodge"" kept some cards close to its chest in revealing the plot via summaries and teaser trailers, and therefore provided a small handful of genuinely shocking moments for the audience that sat through to the visceral ending.Since I haven't yet seen ""Goodnight Mommy"" I was a bit in the dark about expected themes, although I figured I had garnered enough about the expected tone through the shots provided in the trailer--snow drenched cabin in the middle of nowhere, dimly lit so as to provide ample opportunity to imagine just what could look in the darker corners.A lot of reviews have compared ""The Lodge"" to ""Hereditary"", and the comparisons make sense, especially when you consider the usage of dollhouses/scale imitations and isolated scenery (granted, ""The Lodge"" clears amps up the social isolation). While both meditate on trauma, I think that the clear lines between the inherited trauma present in ""Hereditary"" and the singular emotional trauma inherent to Grace's character really place a divider between the two. Much more of a focus is put on faith and Christian guilt here, as well, which ties in very naturally to the trauma already present. Both also tackle mental illness with immense finesse, especially at the end (don't worry, I won't spoil it!).If a slow-burn arthouse horror is what you're craving, give ""The Lodge"" a shot--but be prepared for the chill that it works into, and leaves, in your bones--even after the credits.",The Lodge

Sure, she might have gotten turned around but just before the ""big reveal?"" wouldn't the kids had stopped her and revealed their plan the entire time? Either risking her freezing to death or worse; could potentially finding help somewhere.Second issue I have is the dog barking. Again, breaking the rules of what the film started off by doing. If Grace was actually the one roaming around the house at night, why would the dog bark? Look closely at the person walking. It's not either of the kids. It's clearly her.The film looked as though the mother who killed herself was haunting the lodge. On the back of the case when I rented the film it clearly said, ""specters."" This film has none whatsoever.At least The House That Jack Built had the guts to pull the trigger and give us an ending no one expected while delivering a promised ending and more.

586,Vanillafinch,You Reap What You Sow,6,17 May 2020,"I thought this movie was pretty good. I'm your pretty cliche horror fan, so I like some jump scares and a spooky plot. I'm usually wary of more ""subtle"" artsy horror movies because I think sometimes they're overhyped and boring and I was thinking this could be one of those.
This isn't really a horror movie though, it's more of a psychological thriller in my opinion.
I liked that the movie gave you this very stereotypical idea of what the movie is going to be about early on (crazy new girlfriend tortures grieving children while dad is aloof to the whole thing) and then slowly you find out Grace is actually pretty much the only victim of this entire movie.
I like the kids being the antagonists in the movie because it felt sort of believable that kids who hated their future stepmom and don't really understand the true nature of her mental health issues could do some seriously hurtful things. I like a dark ending and honestly it felt a little justified. I'm not sure if we're supposed to feel not terribly sorry that the kids that broke a women's mind in the end pay the ultimate price? But it definitely felt like a ""you reap what you sow"" moment.
The cinematography is great and the acting is really great too!
There were some off things that bugged me though. The father being the biggest one. Is it really believable that a man would be a big enough fool to orchestrate some trip to lock his children in a house with this woman they literally despise by themselves? Also, he seemed to know very little about a woman he had plans to marry and leave his kids alone with. I'm supposed to believe she's never once done the creepy sleepwalking thing with him? Or that he wouldn't know she's on medication for what is obviously severe PTSD?I'm also a bit confused about the plethora of ""pranks"" the kids play on her. Did they let the dog out on purpose? Because that's sick. Did Aiden make up this sheet showing they've all died before the trip? Because there was no power in the house most of the time because if so, he's probably the sickest character in the show. Also the snow angels seemed a bit impossible for two kids. I've chalked a couple of these things up to Grace's deteriorating mental state. Since the movie is mostly from her POV I suppose it's possible she imagined the snow angels as she was clearly hallucinating some of the time.
The movie also is a bit too long. I find this a common issue with the more artsy horror/thriller movies.Anyway, I say it's worth the watch. Not really scary in the traditional sense but more scary in that humans are terrible and we do awful things to each other that sometimes result in loss of life.",The Lodge

The gruesome and unexpected suicide in the beginning grabs the viewer attention,than it only gets worse, cliché after cliché, the type of movie that would have made Hitchcock fall asleep.The ending is simply revolting. That monstrous woman who destroyed two kids' family gets to ""finish the job"". I've seen movies that are much worse, but this one is simply a waste of time. And how come Aiden and Mia don't ever mention the video depicting her filming the bodies of the cult?I've never seen a film from these directors before, don't know anything about them, but they certainly have a long career ahead, there's always market for mediocre, cheap thrillers.",The Lodge

As with Midsommar, I think this may hit home more with viewers who have experienced trauma or a traumatic death in their lives. Grief is powerful. Trauma and self doubt are powerful. Coming from that perspective, I don't think it was as confusing as some other reviews state. I've been waiting to see this for awhile and wasn't disappointed. If you're watching to be scared or witness some mindless killing, maybe skip this one. If you want to be disturbed, I think this will deliver.

613,richardmartinez-526-238280,A slow burner,8,4 May 2020,"Judging by the grammar and overall tone of some of the reviewers, I imagine that they don't have a wide breadth of taste or experience.
This is not full of jump scares or monsters or aliens, so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. This is in the same vein of hereditary and midsommar. ""Disturbing"" is a word that kept popping in my mind.
Acting was excellent. The story slowly unfolded and the tension ratcheted up with each scene.
The take home is, ""don't F- with crazy people.""
Great directing and cinematography.

614,PhillyPuddy,For Those Who Love Horror Rather Than Be Spoonfed Conventions,9,27 February 2020,"Look...I see some of the people criticizing this movie for not giving all the answers to it in some sort of ""magical twist"" where everything is explained. I mean, really? That is what has been killing horror in the 21st Century. Because let's face it, sometimes the explanations can be downright dumb and insulting. The Lodge is the exception to this ""spoon fed"" variety...And that is why people who love the way horror used to be find this movie so exceptional.First of all, anyone who thinks this movie is stupid is because it didn't give them what they ""expected"" to see. Hands down. But then, who wants to go see a movie where they know what is going to happen?! Let the nay sayers feel free to go make a movie themselves. I am sure it will be wonderful...To them. However, The Lodge seems like a chunk of reality that was placed on your plate...Reality is not always tied up in a neat little bow...That is for sit-coms and other such fair. If you want a movie that brings horror, true horror, where the unexplained and the unanswered leaves you with a sense of dread foreboding, go see The Lodge.Alicia Silverstone is amazing in this, as are the rest of the cast. The writing is tight, the imagery is beautiful and bleak, and with the idea mental health issues at the forefront (and how sometimes people mess with those with mental health issues), The Lodge paints an awesome picture of what COULD happen in such a situation. It is gritty, unflinching and keeps you intrigued to the end. Seriously...It's great.",The Lodge

They spend all this time building suspense with ominous music, washed out color, and somber tone, only to leave you confused, cheated, and scared for nothing.Here's a great way to describe the experience: it's like being told you are going to go and eat the best dinner of your life, you dress up, the restaurant looks amazing, the aroma is tantalizing, atmosphere is inviting, and you keep getting all the signs that you are about to eat the best meal of your life! But you keep seeing a creepy banjo on the floor. Then you are told to go to another room and when you get there, no one else is in the room, except that creepy banjo. You go into the kitchen for an explanation, and the chef is sitting in a bathtub full of jello. Finally, a waiter comes out with your dinner, and then....nothing. Story over.

617,srtviper2011,Overdosing on benadryl was a more enjoyable experience than this movie,1,10 February 2021,"Started off promising but very quickly defiled any promises made. If I wanted to experience 2 hours of restless delirium I'd choke down one too many benadryl, which would still be more enjoyable than watching this movie.
Tried too hard to be psychological without have any depth or real substance, and worst of all it used religion as a scapegoat to give the illusion of backstory and depth.
It's as if they asked someone who's never experienced psychosis or ever even read anything about it to make a movie entirely based on it. A disappointment through and through, even the cinematography was passionless.
Another spear to lampoon this disastrous piece of cinema; this is what I imagine people who have no real understanding of psychology and psychiatric disorders think they look like. Anyone who thinks this movie is deep and psychological should be ashamed to think they even know what those words mean, a person who thinks this movie is deep is like a child who thinks staying up past their bed time is a war crime.

I found this movie very creepy & a whole lotta scarier than anything I've seen recently. It's definitely a psychological terror, rather than an under-the-bed-dweller scarer.

She did a good job delivering her role and she was honestly the most likable character considering her background and how she behaved throught most parts of the movie. Every other actor in this film... not so much.
The movie contains a lot of obvious plot devices and it became pretty clear to me quite early what path the director is going to approach. The supposed twists were not surprising at all, and there was a chance for a great twist at the very end, which sadly never happened, but would have elevated the movie for me for an additional point. The movie is packed with stereotypes about mental illness, which really reminded me a lot of the typical tropes, that shark movies often have to deal with, and it does not do justice to reality. In fact it is rather insulting. I ignored that fact for my rating because after all we are talking about a ""Horror"" movie, but it was definitely something that i noticed. I did not find any of the common horror themes however and i strongly believe that simply marketing as a ""Thriller"" would have been more honest, even though it would not change my rating.",The Lodge

637,tegrossman,Depressing to More Depressing,2,9 March 2020,"""Horror"" is definitely not an appropriate genre description for The Lodge. Suspense and Psychological Thriller are more apropos. But depressing would be a more apt descriptor. It reminded me of Leaving Las Vegas (1995; Nicolas Cage) in that it starts off depressing and gets more depressing with no redeeming happy-ending payoff. Further, don't expect your confusion and questions to be answered by the end like in a well-crafted M. Night Shyamalan movie (The Village for example). As the credits rolled, my still-confused furrowed brow turned to irritation that I didn't trust my intuition and wasted the last 2 hours. I never felt close or connected to any of the characters, so really didn't care; I just hoped the innocent dog was actually going to be okay.

651,abralucas-65791,Style Over Substance and Pretentious,3,1 May 2020,"This was a clear case of ""style over substance"". From the very beginning you'll notice some takes with constant zooming in, enough to know what you're getting into: a showcase of camera work, concept, style and atmosphere, and though they're very good if analyzed separately, they failed together badly, especially when you take the narrative and script into consideration.The movie tried to put itself into a category of slowly paced horror dramas like The Witch, which was the base for all the pretentiousness ahead. There's even a dollhouse, as if it wasn't too soon to use one right after Hereditary, plus a funeral scene and extensive grief demonstrations that seemed like a deliberate copy of Hereditary.There are dumb and shallow editing choices that made me laugh, like when the characters are watching John Carpenter's The Thing on TV and there's a scene where fire is shot at the creature on screen and the editing interpolates it with a gas heater being lit by a character right after that. A creepy close-up of a toy santa claus decoration and some floating shots inside the dollhouse were another small (but denouncing) moments that wouldn't have happened if this movie had a better ambition other than simply targeting an A24 look and feel and drowning in self indulgence.If you'd really like to push it, you can see some influences from The Shining in it too. But most of all, the worst evident ""borrowing"" was that they tried to make The Others (with Nicole Kidman) happen here also and reverted it later with a handful of April Fool's Day (1986).There's no coherence in a LOT of motivations, reasons and holes throughout the entire thing. It's incredibly boring for a regular popcorn viewer and incredibly frustrating for those who appreciate a deep film and are intellectually aware of details and require them to make sense, add up and go beyond the expectations instead of disappointing shamefully. I only cared to write all this because there was a promise with the way they made the trailer and all the buzz around it, there was a constant promise with all the good crafting in the filmmaking, the good actors and the good visual atmosphere. And when you give all that anticipation to people, it sucks hard to be that disappointed.",The Lodge
