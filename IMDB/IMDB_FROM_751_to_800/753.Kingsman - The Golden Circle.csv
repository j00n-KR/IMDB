0,TheLittleSongbird,"This Circle is not quite golden, but it doesn't collapse",7,22 September 2017,"Having really liked/love Matthew Vaughn's previous work, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was one of my favourites from him and was surprisingly brilliant, with only the somewhat tasteless ending disappointing. The follow-up and Vaughn's first sequel has enough of what 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' so good and is an entertaining film on its own but at the end of the day it feels like something is missing.Like some have said already, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle's' biggest flaw is the length, at nearly two and a half hours (much longer than the first film, which was just over two hours) it does feel too long by about 20-25 minutes or so and it does affect the pacing, which drags in place.Especially when it tries to cram in a lot, not everything feels necessary and some of the narrative is on the flimsy and not quite as eventful side. For example Eggsy's excursion to Glastonbury did feel dragged out and didn't serve as much point to the story as it could have done. The first film had more content but wasn't bloated and everything served a point.As enjoyable as the climax was, Poppy's defeat did feel anti-climactic, and Halle Berry is fairly wasted, as is Channing Tatum in what is essentially a pointless plot device role.However, like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has a huge amount to enjoy. It is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes and audacious production design, if just lacking the operatic grandeur of the first film in the action. Once again, the soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.Vaughn does well on the whole directing, particularly on the stylistic elements and making the action as fun as possible. He does struggle maintaining narrative momentum at times however. Very like the first film, he not just achieves the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing, but but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things.Action-wise, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is fun, especially a nod to the original's bar brawl, the snow gun fight, the opening and the deliciously bonkers climax. At the same, nothing is in the same league as the unforgettable church scene and they lack the unflinching grimness. Here, when it comes to the script, nothing leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar, at times, and very witty (like the culture-clash elements), with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny moments. One does wish that the pacing was tighter and the story more consistently gripping.Regarding the cast, they are top notch. Colin Firth returns and does a phenomenal job playing against type, Taron Egerton isn't quite as likable as in the original but one is engrossed enough in his journey (the Glastonbury excursion could easily have been trimmed) and Mark Strong has the ability to turn beneath-him material into gold and he is as charismatic as ever. Pedro Pascal has a Burt Reynolds vibe to him and it comes over affectionately and amusingly.One has to credit Julianne Moore as an understated but played with relish villain and Jeff Bridges once again showing how fine an actor he is. Was pleasantly surprised by Elton John, appreciate him as a singer and his importance in rock 'n' roll but was admittedly expecting him to be a mugging disaster but he sends himself up to scene-stealing entertaining effect.In conclusion, a fun if inferior sequel where one can see why it has garnered fairly mixed reviews but still better than given credit for. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
1,bkoganbing,Julianne makes it worthwihile,5,22 December 2017,"Unfortunately I got to see this second film of The Kingsman before seeing the
first one. I'm guessing that I would have gotten a lot more had I seen them in
proper order. This certainly is not a stand alone film by any means.Our hero protagonist of the first film Taron Edgerton is on a date with a princess
no less than Kingsman headquarters is hit and almost completely wiped out. The
perpetrator of this evil deed is Julianne Moore who is the main reason to see this
film. She is having the greatest time in her life playing the psychotic villain who
has control of the world wide narcotics trade. Right now she's blackmailing the world having developed a chemical concoction that makes drug users get
sick and die in stages. She's even blackmailing the president of the USA who
is a Trump like lizard of a human being.No worry Edgerton has gone to America where there is a sister organization and he and Colin Firth who has lost his memory, but who regains it after some
shock treatment. Jeff Bridges runs the show and Channing Tatum is one of his
top guys. He swings a lariat like Will Rogers and a bullwhip like Lash LaRue.Watching The Golden Circle is a real blast. Nice special effects, a plot not to take seriously and Julianne Moore who among other things has kidnapped 
Elton John for her own amusement. Is there no end to her evil?",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
2,Leofwine_draca,Lesser sequel,5,7 June 2019,"THE GOLDEN CIRCLE is the second film in the KINGSMAN series and, it has to be said, sillier than ever. This feels very much like an adult version of a SPY KIDS movie, complete with robo-dogs, electric whips and a blatant disregard for the reality of physics and the like. Taron Egerton returns as chav hero Eggsy, this time around battling a new mega-villain played by the gurning, incredibly OTT Julianne Moore. A new supporting cast help out, but generally this isn't an actor's film at all, despite Colin Firth giving a surprisingly sensitive performance. The actors who stand out are Firth, Pascal and Strong, with nobody else doing much. The plot is all over the place and completely ridiculous, while the action is too effects-orientated to do much. However, there are some fun moments and character interplay, and the roving action choreography continues to impress. Overall, this is a lesser beast than the first film.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
3,SnoopyStyle,less appealing than first,6,27 February 2018,"Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) is the ruthless drug queen running the Golden Circle cartel out of her jungle hideout. With one-armed former Kingsman trainee Charlie, she destroys the secret society with a barrage of missiles. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong) are the sole survivors. They find help from the American secret society Statesman located in Kentucky which has made its fortune in whiskey. It turns out that the Statesman had saved Galahad (Colin Firth) a year earlier which left him with amnesia. Poppy unleashes a laced drug upon the world with her holding the only antidote. Eggsy is partnered with agent Tequila (Channing Tatum) until his drug use leaves him with the debilitating blue rash. As the sickness spreads in the population, Eggsy and new partner Whiskey have to find the antidote to save millions.The original came as a big surprise. It's fun and fresh. This sequel is more of the same but much less in other ways. Colin Firth returns for obvious chemistry reason but it isn't something that makes sense. The problem is that the chemistry is all changed up with his amnesia. Also in terms of chemistry, one expected Tatum to be the new partner and there's a jarring misdirection. All in all, the cast chemistry is not as good and I'm surprised that Roxy got killed. On the crazy action, the movie doubles down on that aspect. There is more of it keeping faith with the rule of sequels. Overall, there is more of the similar action and I like the movie less than the original.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
4,Prismark10,Crocodile rock,6,20 September 2017,"In my review of the first Kingsman movie I did say that the final joke was ill advised. At least Elton John gets to deliver a more wittier version in the sequel.In Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) returns, this time every inch the gent. He is even living with the Scandinavian princess and he very much impresses her parents but with one just hiccup.The Kingsmen have been under unprecedented attack, Merlin and Eggsy visit the USA and seek help from their sister organisation, Statesman headed by Champs (Jeff Bridges) and they also find out what happened to Harry Hart's body after he got shot in the last film.The big bad this time is Poppy (Julianne Moore) who just wants to be recognised for her achievements, that being the leader of the biggest and most profitable drug cartel in the world. She issues an ultimatum to a Trump lite president.The film should be a James Bond film on acid, but this one suffers from its long running time where you notice the lack of action sequences and this makes the film feel stodgy which its quirkiness cannot hide. When it is in full throttle it is fun but some of the plot contrivances are glaring.Still the film managed to get five Oscar winners on screen.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
5,claudio_carvalho,"Long, Boring and Overrated",3,2 December 2017,"""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is a long, boring and overrated film. The story is silly and the jokes are unfunny, wasting a cast with famous names and countless cameos. This spoof of 007 and other agent movies never works since it is too violent for a comedy and too dumb to be taken as a serious espionage movie. The good thing is that the viewer can take a nap along the boredom and will not miss anything. The lead couple has no chemistry and the romance is also terrible. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Kingsman: O Círculo Dourado"" (""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"")",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
6,nogodnomasters,I feel like a tornado in a trailer park.,8,18 October 2017,"PLOT SPOILERS Basically, most of the people who were in the first film are killed off, and one who died they bring back. The remaining Kingsman are forced to team up with their American counterparts, The Statemen who all having drinking names. They are after a drug cartel known as ""The Golden Circle"" headed up by Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) who has poisoned all the illegal drugs.This was the same action film spoof nonsense as the first film. Good use of soundtrack and Sir Elton John. Definitely a notch below the original film and not the direction I would have taken for a sequel.Guide: F-word. Near sex. No nudity.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
7,kosmasp,"Good sequel, yet inferior",7,31 December 2017,"I really loved the first Kingsman and I wasn't alone in that sentiment. The sequel continues where the other one left of. If you've seen the trailer, you know that there is a comeback of sorts that doesn't really make too much sense. Apart from the fact that the character was beloved in the first movie. It does take away some of the punch/impact a certain scene had in the first movie though ... at least that's how I feel.But it's nice to see the surving members of the first one evolving or just doing their thing. And the additions and expanding of the universe is really nice. There is an expansion on the Kingsmen and their history. A good funny movie, that lacks some things of its predecessor ... not just the after credits stinger (also missing here), but a few things more",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
8,jboothmillard,Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6,29 September 2017,"The first Kingsman movie, The Secret Service, was fantastic fun and became a huge hit, so expectations were high for the sequel to deliver the same as before, directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class). Basically a year has passed since Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) joined secret international intelligence service organisation Kingsman, and saved the world Richmond Valentine's neurological wave broadcast. Eggsy has now taken the title of Gallahad, that of his late mentor Harry Hart (Colin Firth), and he lies with his girlfriend Crown Princess Tilde of Sweden (Hanna Alström). On his way home, Eggsy is ambushed by a group of henchmen, led by former Kingsman trainee Charles ""Charlie"" Hesketh (Edward Holcroft), who lost his arm and vocal chords during the Valentine incident, Eggsy escapes after a car chase across London. But Charlie's severed cybernetic arm hacks into the Kingsman servers through the car's computer system, and while Eggsy is in Sweden, a simultaneous discharge of missiles destroy the Kingsman headquarters, wiping out all agents in Britain. Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong) are the only surviving agents, they follow the Doomsday protocol, which leads them to their American counterpart, the Statesman, a secret American organisation posing as a Bourbon whiskey distillery in Kentucky. There Eggsy and Merlin are shocked to discover that Harry is alive, following Valentine's gunshot a year earlier the Statesman used their advanced technology to revive him, but a consequence is that he is suffering amnesia. Eggsy and Merlin then meet Statesman head Champagne, or ""Champ"" (Jeff Bridges), they are briefed about a secret terrorist organisation called The Golden Circle, which unknown to them is run by Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore), head of the world's largest drug cartel. They begin their mission by following Charlie's ex- girlfriend Clara Von Gluckfberg (Poppy Delevingne), but Statesman agent Tequila (Channing Tatum) develops blue rashes, he is replaced by agent Jack Daniels aka ""Whiskey"" (Pedro Pascal) as Eggsy's partner. At the Glastonbury Festival, Eggsy manages to plant a tracking device into Clara, but his method puts a strain of his relationship with Princess Tilde, but he does manage to cure Harry's amnesia, triggering his memories by threatening to shoot a dog, resembling Harry's late dog, Mr. Pickles. Poppy Adams broadcasts a message telling the world about a toxin she has laced within every recreational drug available, it causes its users to develop a blue rash, then progresses to mania, then to paralysis, and ultimately death. Poppy demonstrates the antidote on her captive, singer Sir Elton John (himself), and offers it to be distributed globally, only if the President of the United States (Bruce Greenwood) legalises all drug use, ending the War on Drugs, and offering her organisation immunity. The President decides the best course of action is to have every affected user quarantined, including Fox, the Chief of Staff (Emily Watson). Eggsy, Harry and Whiskey head to Italy, they intercepted a call by Charlie to Clara to pinpoint the location of the antidote factory, Eggsy manages to steal an antidote sample, by an ambush by the Golden Circle's henchmen cause it to be broken. Harry suspects Whiskey is playing both sides, he shoots him in the head, but Eggsy uses the same Statesman alpha-gel that revived Harry to save his life, Eggsy realises Princess Tilde is affected by the deadly drug, seeing her in a state of mania, then becoming paralysed. Eggsy, Harry and Merlin discover Poppy's hideout is ""Poppy Land"", a rural jungle area in Cambodia, made to look like a small 1950's style community, they travel there to steal the remote control that will release the drones containing antidote samples. Arriving in Poppy Land, Eggsy steps on a land mine, but Merlin saves him, he sacrifices himself, taking the lair's guards with him, Eggsy and Harry storm through the lair, Eggsy kills Charlie in a brawl, whole Harry destroys Poppy's robotic attack dogs Bennie and Jet, with the help of Elton. They secure the briefcase with the access code to the drones, Poppy is injected with a more potent dose of her toxin, so she will reveal the password, she does so before succumbing to an overdose. Before they can activate the drones, Whiskey shows up to stop them, he mentions losing his pregnant wife in a crossfire between two drug users, it is revealed he is working alone to eliminate all drug users, Eggsy and Harry battle Whiskey and kill him, shoving him in a mincer. The antidote drones are released, millions of lives are saved across the world, the Chief of Staff has the President impeached for conspiring to commit genocide, Champ announces Statesman has acquired a distillery in Scotland to help rebuild Kingsman. In the end, Statesman tech support Ginger Ale (Halle Berry) steps in to take the title of Whiskey, after Eggsy and Harry decline, Eggsy marries Princess Tilde, and Tequila moves to London to work for Kingsman. Also starring Sophie Cookson as Roxy, Samantha Womack as Michelle, Lena Endre as The Queen of Sweden, This Is England's Thomas Turgoose as Liam, Sir Michael Gambon as Arthur and Keith Allen as Charles. Egerton is still likable as the teenage tearaway turned super spy, Firth makes a welcome return as his pithy mentor, Moore relishes being the smiley but menacing villain, and there is great support from supporting cast members Bridges, Berry, Strong and a stand-out from rock and roll royalty Elton. It has got mixed reviews from critics, it does slow down in moments with flimsy narrative, but the fast-paced fight sequences, over-the-top violence, witty and funny script, and special effects ladened gadgetry more than makes up for it, a worthwhile spy action adventure. Good!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
9,BA_Harrison,Matthew makeths a mess.,3,16 February 2018,"The original Kingsman movie was a finely tuned comic-book adventure that presented OTT violence and astonishing action set pieces galore, all with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour. For his sequel, director Matthew Vaughn attempts to give us more of the same, only bigger and louder, but fails on almost every level.There's way too much CGI. From the opening car chase, to the ridiculous robot dogs, to the stupid cable car scene, The Golden Circle suffers from far too much unconvincing digital trickery.The film panders to the American market by introducing the US equivalent of The Kingsman, Southern secret agents The Statesman. The first film possessed a wholly British charm; this one doesn't, and suffers greatly for it.Julianne Moore. Superb actress, but totally miscast as the film's villain, drug baron Poppy.Bringing back Colin Firth as a confused lepidopterist was a really bad move. From badass to befuddled butterfly collector. Why bother?And what was the point of Halle Berry as wannabe Statesman Ginger? She is given absolutely nothing of interest to do throughout the entire film.Worst of all, we have Sir Elton John, not in a brief cameo (THAT, I might have forgiven), but in several supposedly funny scenes so utterly diabolical that they simply have to be seen to be believed. Kingsman 3 had better be Elton free...",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
10,paul_haakonsen,Not too shabby for a sequel...,6,9 June 2018,"After having seen the first movie, I must admit that my expectations for this sequel, but as it is with most sequels then ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" didn't quite live up to the first movie.There were some nice enough scenes throughout the movie, and there was plenty of action, but the movie just lacked that special ingredient that was present in the first movie.And the villain in this movie was just very, very bland, which made for a somewhat terrible movie experience in terms of having a proper villain.The acting in ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" was quite good and they had good actors on the cast list.The action and fighting scenes were nice, as they were in the first movie and they were visually nice to behold.Still an enjoyable movie for what it was, though just not fully up on the same level as the first movie.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
11,tavm,I didn't have to watch the one before Kingsman: The Golden Circle to get a big enjoyment out of it!,8,4 October 2017,"I watched this movie with my cinema-employed friend having not seen the previous ep made before this one. It didn't matter as some of it was explained as the picture went on and much of the action set pieces were entertaining enough for me to not care too much if I occasionally got confused. Oh, and there's a famous Music Star who appears throughout much of it to make it even more enjoyable especially as I know it's my friend's favorite singer. So that's my recommendation of Kingsman: The Golden Circle.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
12,BandSAboutMovies,Not as great as the first but still decent,6,25 April 2020,"A year after defeating Valentine in the first film, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) has officially joined the Kingsman, having taken his late mentor Harry Hart's title of Galahad and is dating Tilde, Crown Princess of Sweden (Hanna Alstrom). He's soon attacked by Charlie, the rejected Kingsman who turned on the world in the wake of Valentine's plot. During their battle, he hacks into the Kingsman's database, allowing Poppy Adams (Julianna Moore) and her drug cartel the Golden Circle to murder every single Kingsman agent save Eggsy and handler Merlin (Mark Strong).How can Eggsy save the world from a deadly virus spread by doing recreational drugs? Simple. Head to America and meet the Statesmen, the American side of the secret spy world.While the Kingsman are based around fine clothes, the Statesman are based around hard alcohol. They're led by Champagne (Jeff Bridges) and have Ginger Ale (Halle Berry), Whiskey (Pedro Pascal) and Tequila (Channing Tatum) in their organization. And oh yeah - they've saved Harry's life, but he remembers nothing of being a spy.This movie is completely ridiculous, taking the farce of the first movie even further to the point that Elton John battles a robotic guard dog.I love the scene in the Italian Alps, as it feels as if it were taken directly from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Again, despite how outlandish this gets, it's so much better than the recent spate of Bond films.At the wedding scene at the end of this movie, Harry claims that one of their founding agents once said. ""This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."" That person would be British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill.I'm excited to see where the Kingsmen go next, both in a proposed third film and a prequel that has been moved to September of this year.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
13,LeonLouisRicci,"Icky Dark Humor & Loud, Long CGI Action Sprawl Separate this from the Original",7,23 December 2017,"All and Any of the Sophistication of the First ""Kingsman"" is Abandon for Icky Dark Comedy and a Sprawl of Action Sequences that can leave You Breathless, Exhausted, and it becomes a bit Tiresome unless Your Anticipatory Attraction to Video Game Visuals is what You Desire and Expect.This Long and Entertaining Movie has its Ups and Downs, Ins and Outs, and can cause a Cringe from Prudish Types.

14,zardoz-13,"Not As Good As The Original, But Still Worth Watching!!!",8,9 October 2017,"""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is a good action-comedy thriller, but it doesn't surpass director Matthew Vaughn's original ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" Nevertheless, the sheer audacity of this outrageous sequel makes it worth watching, despite lackluster villains who aren't as intimidating as Gazelle with her razor-sharp blade-feet and her boss Valentine with the surgically inserted SIM cards in a person's head that stimulated hostility and suppressed inhibition. Unfortunately, if you missed ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (2014), you may find many of the story elements in the sequel difficult to follow. Several original cast members reprise their roles, among them newcomer Taron Egerton (slated to star as Robin Hood in ""Robin Hood"" next year), Colin Firth of ""The King's Speech,"" and Mark Strong as Merlin. Matthew Vaughn and ""Kick Ass"" writer Jane Goldman, who adapted Mark Millar's graphic novel ""The Secret Service,"" return respectively as director and writer. Although they don't scale the sensational heights of the earlier ""Kingsman,"" they don't shrink from the task of trying to match it. In the original ""Kingsman,"" we learned about a private espionage agency in London, England, created after World War I, which hides behind the dubious façade of a Saville Row clothing emporium named Kingsman. This elite agency is comparable to the classic American television series ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"" but its agents not only far better trained, but also dressed immaculately for success. In the first film, after a raid on a terrorist stronghold, Harry Hart, code-named Agent Galahad (Colin Firth) interrogated a villain. The first thing out of the fiendish villain's mouth was the pin from a grenade. The explosion that ensued would have blown Galahad to bits had his fellow agent Lee (Jonno Davies of ""In the Name of Ben Hur"") not intervened to save Harry's life. Indebted to Lee, Hart provided Lee's son Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) with a chance years later to compete with other candidates to become a Kingsman agent. In ""Kingsman: The Secret Service,"" 'Eggsy' proved his ingenuity. Sadly, Harry died when Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction"") shot him in the left eye at close range.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" opens with a careening, adrenaline-laced ride through London. The impeccably attired 'Eggsy' tangles with his old ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" nemesis who initially competed with him to be a Kingsman agent. Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft of ""Vampire Academy"") surprises 'Eggsy' outside the Kingsman tailor shop. 'Eggsy' is shocked to see Charlie, because Charlie's right arm was obliterated along with his vocal chords. 'Eggsy' dives into a cab, and Charlie plunges in after him. Charlie and 'Eggsy' clash in a monumental life-and-death struggle. Charlie constitutes a James Bond type villain because he comes equipped with a cybernetic arm. 'Eggsy' manages to defeat Charlie and tear off the cybernetic arm. Nevertheless, the arm conceals itself within the cab until the coast is clear and then hacks into the Kingsman server via an onboard computer in the cab. A cataclysmic attack on the Kingsman headquarters ensues that destroys everything and almost everybody. Happily, 'Eggsy' and Merlin survive this Armageddon. Director Matthew Vaughn doesn't let any grass grow under our heroes' feet during these first two dynamic super-charged, action scenes. Indeed, these over-the-top, larger-than-life exercises in sophisticated violence are worth the price of admission, even if you haven't seen the original ""Kingsman.""Later, we're told that Charlie has gone into business with psychotic villainess Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore of ""The Big Lebowski""), who ranks as one of the world's most notorious traffickers in recreational drugs galore. This malevolent Martha Stewart matron conducts her business from a remote corner of Southeast Asia, and she calls her enterprise 'The Golden Circle.' Everybody who works for Poppy has a golden circle branded on their anatomy. Poppy doesn't tolerate any nonsense from her minions. She grinds up one of her treacherous henchmen into a hamburger that she serves to another prospective employee. She decides to hold the entire world for ransom by tainting all her narcotics with a toxin that disfigures the user's face with blue veins. Eventually, the millions infected will succumb to paralysis followed by torturous death. Poppy offers an antidote if the President of the United States (Bruce Greenwood of ""Thirteen Days"") will halt the futile War on Drugs and grant immunity to all cartels. Of course, the President refuses. Instead, he hopes the deaths of all recreational drug users will end the War on Drugs. Meantime, 'Eggsy' and Merlin follow emergency protocol. They fly to the United States and sit down with their American counterparts at another elite but clandestine secret service agency named Statesman. Located in rural Kentucky, Statesman cloaks their hush-hush activities behind the façade of a whiskey distillery. Champagne (Jeff Bridges of ""Iron Man"") presides over Statesman, and he provides 'Eggsy' and Merlin with everything necessary to vanquish Poppy. He also assigns his two top agents, Tequila (Channing Tatum of ""Magic Mike"") and Whiskey (Pedro Pascal of ""Narcos""), to aid them. If you think I've told you too much about ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"" think again! This synopsis barely scratches the surface of all the outlandish antics in this globe-trotting extravaganza. Clearly, director Matthew Vaughn and scenarist Jane Goldman revere the James Bond blockbusters because they have borrowed characters and predicaments from ""Goldfinger,"" ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" ""Live and Let Die,"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" Meanwhile, the Statesman agent code-named Whiskey, as portrayed by Pedro Pascal, could pass for Burt Reynolds's twin brother. Furthermore, Whiskey wields an electric lasso Wonder Woman might have a tough time evading. Miraculously, Harry Hart returns to the fold with an eye patch and accompanies our heroes for a do-or-die assault on Poppy's headquarters against an army of henchmen as well as two ravenous, robotic canines with stainless steel jaws. ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" amounts to an all-around showcase for gravity-defying stunts and boisterous comedy you won't forget.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
15,george.schmidt,Over-the-top and borderline cartoon sequel to the franchise-wanna-be spy series,7,1 October 2017,"KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLE (2017) **1/2 Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, Jeff Bridges, Pedro Pascal, Edward Holcroft, Hanna Alstrom, Michael Gambon, Sophie Cookson, Elton John (as Himself) Over-the-top and borderline cartoon sequel to the franchise-wanna-be spy series with Egerton and Strong teaming up to stop evil Moore from her scheme to wipe out the world populace using drugs (don't ask; just go with it or better not don't) and joining up with their American counter group The Statesman led by Bridges. While filmmaker Matthew Vaughn (who collaborated again on the script with Jane Goldman from the original) employs every trick in the book (CGI; '70s jukebox rock to pepper up the ongoing Matrix-like action sequence and fisticuff sequences) the secondary characters pale in comparison to say Firth's non-plussed, gentleman soldier at arms who returns in a 'sure-why-not' undead requiem.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
16,neil-476,"Fun, but not as much as the original",7,8 May 2018,"Eggsy is doing nicely, living in Harry's flat with his Norwegian princess when an attack wipes out everything Kingsman except Merlin. So these two have to search out help before tracking down the enemy.I shall say no more because I don't want to give away anything which isn't in the trailer. All I can say is that more than half a dozen cast members from the first film return, as well as director Matthew Vaughan and co-writer Jane Goldman, and they deliver another satisfying outing into a variation of the James Bond world in which the volume is turned up to 11 and there are loads of ""f***""s in the dialogue (rather more than necessary in my view).There is nothing here which delights as much as ""Manners maketh man"" or Land Of Hope And Glory in the first one, but there are a couple of moments - not necessarily action show pieces - which left me with a wide smile on my face. The characters are all engaging, even the villains, and there is quite a lot of fun to be had. Not everything you expected to happen happens, and some things you didn't expect to happen do happen, so it's not as predictable as one might expect.Taron Egerton effortlessly carries the film, albeit aided and abetted with terrific support from both old and new cast members (Channing Tatum was given surprisingly little to do). If you didn't like the first one then there is nothing here which will change your mind. But, if you did, you'll enjoy this though, perhaps, not quite as much.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
17,FlashCallahan,Kingsman is Crumpets........,6,11 October 2017,"When the Kingsman headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage, their journey leads them to the discovery of an allied organisation called Statesman, dating back to the day they were both founded. 
The two organisations band together to defeat a ruthless common enemy, in order to save the world, something that's becoming a bit of a habit for the cast, the screenwriters, but never forgetting to break the fourth wall, Elton John Style.
I'm still standing after seeing this overlong, pretty tepid sequel that asks the viewer to defy all logic and lower expectations in order to welcome back Colin Firth for this movie.
The first movie was a pretty sound idea, getting a working class thug and introducing him into an upper middle class organisation, and inserting the old fish out of water scenario that adds a little subtext to the narrative.
The majority of that has gone in this film, so in order to cover the hollowness of the story, the makers just scatter a lot of very good actors in pretty worthless roles.
Tatum, Bridges, Berry, and Moore are all featured heavily in the trailer, but Moore aside, the other three are hardly in the film, but then Egerton is wonderful as Eggsy, despite some of the things he has to do for Queen and country, especially one ill judged scenes that is set in Glastonbury, and if you've seen this film, you'll know what I mean when I say 'I'd give this sequence the middle finger'.
The action is more comic book this time, removing any hint of danger for our heroes, because if you can bring back a character whom was clearly killed in the first film, no one is in danger, and it has an air of a Marvel Studios production.
And then there is Elton John. 
A cameo lasting a few seconds would have sufficed, but when he becomes an integral part of the third act, and ruins the films consistency.

The two organisations band together to defeat a ruthless common enemy, in order to save the world, something that's becoming a bit of a habit for the cast, the screenwriters, but never forgetting to break the fourth wall, Elton John Style.I'm still standing after seeing this overlong, pretty tepid sequel that asks the viewer to defy all logic and lower expectations in order to welcome back Colin Firth for this movie.The first movie was a pretty sound idea, getting a working class thug and introducing him into an upper middle class organisation, and inserting the old fish out of water scenario that adds a little subtext to the narrative.The majority of that has gone in this film, so in order to cover the hollowness of the story, the makers just scatter a lot of very good actors in pretty worthless roles.Tatum, Bridges, Berry, and Moore are all featured heavily in the trailer, but Moore aside, the other three are hardly in the film, but then Egerton is wonderful as Eggsy, despite some of the things he has to do for Queen and country, especially one ill judged scenes that is set in Glastonbury, and if you've seen this film, you'll know what I mean when I say 'I'd give this sequence the middle finger'.The action is more comic book this time, removing any hint of danger for our heroes, because if you can bring back a character whom was clearly killed in the first film, no one is in danger, and it has an air of a Marvel Studios production.And then there is Elton John.

19,phd_travel,Party successful but doesn't quite work as a whole,6,28 September 2017,The main fault of this movie is that it was too long and there were scenes that could have been cut and edited and shortened. Some parts seemed stalled and it wasn't really funny when it could have been. The humor wasn't as good as the first one.It was fun to see your favorite actors and actresses pop up. Julianne Moore as the beautiful and brutal villainess. Also from Narcos everybody's favorite DEA agent - Pedro Pascal. Halle and Channing had small parts.There are parts of the story that are quite current like the legalizing drugs and how cocaine is less addictive and harmful than sugar excuse.The rather dizzy fight sequences are quite silly fun.Not a great movie but worth one watch.,Kingsman - The Golden Circle
20,gradyharp,'He stepped on a landmine. Can we get somebody out there to clean that up? Hello?',5,17 December 2017,"Some sequels work, some don't. KINGSMAN 2 is a very long, every active visually, CGI spectacle that simply forgot to add a reasonable storyline to the huge cat of excellent actors searching for characters to portray. True, KINGSMAN is based on a comic book (Mark Millar, Dave Gibbons) and the initial film worked fairly well. This second installment written by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn (who also directs) is slight on story, big on special effects, and seems to care more about explosions and robotic figures than a spy spoof.
The 'plot': A devastating attack leaves Kingsman with just two surviving agents, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong). They must travel to the United States to find Statesman, a forgotten ally operating out of Kentucky with its own distinctly American way of doing things. New allies and old friends band together to face the global threat of Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) and the Golden Circle.In the midst of all this stars that attempt to make a difference in the experience include Edward Holcroft, Colin Firth, Michael Gambon, Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, Elton John (yes, really!), Jeff Bridges, Pedro Pascal, Bruce Greenwood, Emily Watson, Tom Benedict Knight - and more.For those diehard comic book fans this is a long evening of entertainment.

And like always after watching the first movie you have big expectations for the sequel. And I wasn't disappointed. Okay the first one was better but that's almost all the time the case with movies like that. It's still better than any James Bond movie to me though. The cast in Kingsman: The Golden Circle is top notch. Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Julianne Moore, Mark Strong, Jeff Bridges and Pedro Pascal are all a delight to watch in their respective characters. Halle Berry is the exception to me. I don't think she's a great actress and I never will think it. The story is again candy for the eye with a lot of fast action scenes, good special effects and new interesting spy gadgets. I hope there will be more Kingsman movies.

22,siderite,What a failure of a sequel to a real fun film,5,1 December 2017,"This movie has all the possible sins for sequels: rehashing the story, rehashing the villain, having celebrities in the cast, then using them for just a few scenes, lowering every possible standard, making it lamer than the original and the dreaded bait and switch.Did you see Channing Tatum in the trailer? That's because he appears in a few scenes then spends the film in cryostasis. Did you see Jeff Bridges in the trailer? He says a few words over whiskey and he's done. What do we get instead? A lot of Pedro Pascal! Who wasn't even born in the US! Don't get me wrong, I like the guy, but his character was real stupid. Oh, and Elton John stars in the movie as himself, serving as a comedic relief and a hostage for the villain.Bottom line: even bringing Colin Firth back showed lack of a spine. The film felt like a gigantic betrayal of the first film, even if it wasn't a great masterpiece either. The more I think about it, the more offensive flaws I find.

It's typical the film revolves around a band and circle of people who go to fight spies and make worldwide and international things go better first and foremost that's to rescue hostages and save the day. The action scenes are high tech and a little unreal with gadgets yet still they are entertaining.

24,DKosty123,A Mixture of Bond And Drugs Saving The World,7,24 September 2017,"A lot of this has been done before, but never quite like this. The save the world plot is a staple of several James Bond films. In this one we actually have illegal drug addiction involved in this plot. It is actually a bit too possible. Illegal drug content has never been controlled and this movie uses that fact in the plot.The comic book series second feature is close to the first one, and yet is different. These films have no problem killing a lot of the good guys each time out. In some cases they bring back some good guys too, and make it all fit into the frame work of the plot.This film does all of that, and adds a fair amount of humor, and some gross stuff as well. It uses 1950's themes, and brings Whiskey and Kentucky into the mix quite nicely. It uses a large cast, a ton of special effects, humor, dogs, and an evil President to pull out all the stops. It nearly destroys the world, and then saves it for better or worse.The downside is at the end of the film, it is getting much harder to find a good suit, unless you get a drink. Jeff Bridges stands out in a limited role, and all the regulars from the last one are here for the most part. There are flash backs used effectively in several portions of the film.The plot is easy to follow and look for a sequence late in the movie where something is ""backwards."" Is it an inside joke or is it a mirror? You can decide that for yourself. This one puts this comic book film series through the mirror. The action is plenty, in every way. A lot of folks pay the ultimate price as saving the world is definitely not cheap.This movie makes great use of Elton John and impeaches a US President, though the guy does not look like Trump or the reviewer ratings would be much higher.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
25,lasttimeisaw,"a hyperbolic, brand-advertising and inordinately smug hotchpotch of a half-baked cash cow",5,21 December 2017,"Enticed by a fatter paycheck and more directorial latitude, Matthew Vaughn finally caves in for making his first sequel after many a critically appraised mainstream artifact under his belt, and the outcome is roundly, a major let-down. Racking up more household names in the beefed-up cast (4 Oscar-winners are at Vaughn's disposal) and compared with its gratifying first chapter, the second outing of the UK secret intelligence Kingsman is visually derivative and thematically callous. Plot-wise, the faux-father-son correlation between Eggsy (Egerton) and Harry Hart (Firth) is the mainspring in the works after patly resuscitating the latter from the grave beyond, only significantly undercut by a surly Firth who looks like he would rather be in somewhere else than back in the fold. Also the romantic byplay between Eggsy and Princess T of Sweden (Alström) doesn't register any real chemistry to shore up their devoted union, conversely, it falls right into the fix of cliché and stilted caprice.On the callous part, casually dispatching the arguably most competent agent of its ilk along with other conveniently home-bound senior honchos, Roxy (Cookson) is graded first among the new recruits in the chapter one, is a misogyny-tinged, lame move and belies that it is still a boy's game in the vein, a blinkered mindset under the spiffy surface. Then there is a self-sacrifice from one of our beloved characters right before the final battle, sentimentally coupled with John Denver's country dirge but as Kingsman's relentless gizmo-purveyor, it really doesn't make any sense that Merlin (Strong) has no other alternative to deal with a simple land mine, it is at once heroic, vacuous and over-deliberate, yet it is not that egregious when we compare it with Eggsy-Harry pair's minced liquidation of someone who is clearly not a heinous murderer but has a slightly more world-savvy and self-seeking opinion about the crisis caused by our villainess Poppy (an almost t00 delectable to detest Moore), who is the best thing in this hyperbolic, brand-advertising and inordinately smug hotchpotch of a half-baked cash cow, she should have a robotic army under her command instead of just two miserly ferocious watchdogs and a handful of cannon fodder to safeguard her empire, if she is indeed the richest drug dealer alive. Regarding of the money-splurged action pieces, Vaughn ratchets up its CGI-burnished sleekness, scale-related showiness but nothing is even remotely in the same league of the groundbreaking church massacre money shot in the previous one, and the most pernicious thing is, THE GOLDEN CIRLE is so crummy that it conduces to the self-questioning of why one has fallen under the spell of its antecedent in the first place, and it impels me to peruse my rosy review of KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE (2014) to mollify the grievances, that is a bummer one doesn't properly foresee!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
26,Hellmant,I sure hope the next 'KINGSMAN' movie is a lot better!,6,22 September 2017,"'KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLE': Three Stars (Out of Five)A sequel to the 2017 surprise spy action-comedy hit 'KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE'; which was based on the 'Kingsman' comic book series, created by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. The film was once again directed by Matthew Vaughn, and written by Vaughn and Jane Goldman (the duo have co-written six screenplays together now). Original cast members Taron Egerton, Colin Firth (who's character presumably died in the original film), Mark Strong, Edward Holcroft and Sophie Cookson all reprise their roles in this sequel; while newcomers Julianne Moore, Pedro Pascal, Halle Berry, Hanna Alstrom, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Bruce Greewood, Emily Watson, and Elton John all join the cast. The story, this time, revolves around the Kingsmen having to team up with a similar team of American spies, in order to take on a new enemy in London. The movie has received mixed (to negative) reviews from critics (unlike the highly praised original), but it is expected to be another hit at the Box Office still though. Being a fan of the original, as well as Vaughn's other films, I was severely disappointed with this movie. The film takes place one year after the events of the original movie, when Eggsy Unwin (Egerton) is now the Kingsman's top operative, and he's also living with Princess Tilde (Alstrom) of Sweden. When all of the other Kingsmen are taken out in a missile attack, from a new enemy in London (called The Golden Circle), Unwin and Merlin (Strong) travel to Kentucky to meet their American counterparts (called The Statesman). They learn that The Golden Circle, lead by Poppy Adams (Moore), has laced every recreational drug with a deadly toxin. Adams demands that the President of the United States (Greenwood) ends his war on drugs, in order for her to release the antidote that can cure everyone. The British and American agents must team together in order to save millions. The movie is bigger than the original, in almost every way, including a much bigger cast of celebrities and even more over-the- top action scenes. Still, despite all of this, the movie feels so much smaller in comparison, for what it's able to accomplish. Some of it is fun, but it's mostly just a big mess, and I was bored for most of it's extremely excessive 2 hours and 21 minutes running length. Seeing as how Vaughn and Goldman have produced much better films together, in the past, this movie was a big disappointment for me. The action scenes are boring, a lot of the humor is humorless, and the celebrities are often more of a distraction than an actual addition of talent. I sure hope the next 'KINGSMAN' movie is a lot better.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/234520321",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
27,thesar-2,Endlessly Circling the Wagon,4,17 April 2018,"My guess is that they were afraid there wouldn't be a KINGSMAN III: CHECKMATE so they crammed 3 movies into this one follow-up. Right.Damnit, fellas, learn to edit. This movie severely needed to be cut down. I'd say at least two-three subplots and 40 minutes oughta do it.I really didn't want to rate this movie so low, because a few scenes were actually really good. Unfortunately, those scenes were so few and so far in-between - plus, they happened so late in this overlong project. I actually started this review with the same amount of stars I gave the first of the Kingsman ""franchise:"" 3/5 stars. But, after collecting my thoughts, there were sadly more negatives than positives to equate an average rating.First, as stated, the length. Second, the poor excuse to bring 'em back for the sequel since people loved the character cliché. Third and in conjunction with two, that damn amnesia subplot. I hate that trope and they wasted so much screen time to get said favorite character back to normal. (SEE: Men in Black II.) Fourth, the overuse of Fox News. Bah!It's been a couple of years since I've seen the first, so maybe the sequel's opening was a little too radical for me. It involves an unintentionally hilarious and bad action scene that I kept expecting was some sort of cheap cartoon since it was so fake. I nearly wanted to turn this off several times on how bored I was with how absurd it looked. I stuck with it, despite two strikes against it in less than 10 minutes: I knew how long this movie was going to be and I couldn't get invested with the comically bad CGI in the action.That said, I'm glad I did finish the movie off because there were a couple of well-worth scenes ahead. But, only if you can climb aboard the ridiculous nature of this alternative universe. The simple synopsis is: a secluded drug kingpin (played deliciously by Julianne Moore) is drugging her own drugs with a deadly virus in order to come out of the closet as a heroine (get it?) after giving everyone the antidote and become a star! Only one thing, she's got the Kingsmen to deal with! Or what's left of them and their plot-device cousins.That's like 10% of the movie as there's far too much more going on. But, at least, it's the gist of what the core is. The movie's wildly unrealistic, but as the movie progresses, you kinda drift into the weird nature and accept it. Sadly, though, one outrageously bad figure is the President. (No spoilers, he literally advises his intents immediately.) Any time of my entire life prior to 2016 would I think this President is lampoonish and would never happen. The scariest thing of this movie was how spot-on they were with our current President and how badly he would act just like this psycho moron.Of all the craziness here and the complete suspension from reality...they nailed our current evil and brainless leader. Probably, most satirical, was that they used many scenes from Fox News and in real life, they worship the grounds he walks on. Here they go down with that sinking ship. Woo-hoo. Seriously, that should add another star right there. But, no. This movie was far too long and some of the many subplots made me cringe on how needlessly they stretched this out. Even when the climax concluded, I checked out as we had about 20 minutes still to go.I kept reciting the famous words of Seinfeld's Elaine Benes in my head: ""I can't do this anymore! It's too long! End this movie already!""***Final Thoughts: Ironically, my dear friend and movie critic just recently, in his latest podcast, spoke about separating politics and his reviews/show. I added a lot here because, frankly, they did spoof our childlike President with his absolutely horrible policies and impulses. It's worth noting, the best shot in the film, above all else, was the last shot of Fox News and the fate of the President. Priceless and worth watching the movie alone.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
28,cherold,terrible movie with some great action sequences,5,29 August 2019,"The first Kingsmen movie was a bunch of terrific action scenes held together with a somewhat interesting story and a kill villain. Kingsmen: The Golden Circle, is several brilliant action scenes held together by a dull and tedious ""story"" and moments of striking stupidity.The first great action scene that starts the movie is followed by the first moment of true stupidity, in which super-agent Eggsy doesn't even think to check the high-tech thing he knows is in his car. After that, there is disaster, a contingency plan that makes no sense, and most stupid of all an utterly absurd scene involving planting a nonsensical tracking device apparently designed by a serial rapist.While there are a few good scenes with Elton John and Julianne Moore is a rather fun villain, overall this is a pretty bad movie. If you were to remove the action scenes it would be unwatchable, while if everything but the action scenes were removed it would be incomprehensible but more enjoyable.While the first movie was notable for it's extreme right-wing, paranoid anti-environmentalist story, the politics in the sequel are harder to pin down. The filmmakers do seem slightly contrite about the all-white-male heroes approach of the first film, tossing in Halle Berry as an American tech agent, and while the movie is still suspicious of government, this time their suspicious of anti-drug warriors while also portraying drug dealers as awful. Drug users are actually portrayed sympathetically (something that's been increasing during the caucasian-based opioid epidemic) and a review pointed out that in the movie it seems only white people use illicit drugs.So while the first movie was a paranoid Tea Party diatribe, this movie is just weirdly paranoid. I guess that's a step up.My advice, watch the action scenes, fast forward through everything else.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It feels like the fifth film in a franchise struggling to maintain it's relevancy, not like the follow-up to what was perhaps the most promising new property in Hollywood.",5,29 September 2017,"'Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017)' is essentially all a big joke played on those who took umbrage at the few select sexualised moments from the final act of the first film, a joke whereby everything is consistently ramped up to eleven regardless of its negative impact on the story. This standoffish move is meant to further separate the apparent 'critics' from the so-called 'fans', yet it only successfully provides both categories with a much worse experience. While I and many other 'fans' didn't mind (or at least excused) the passive, clearly satirical crude jests and occasional absurdity of the original picture, we certainly didn't want a follow-up based entirely around what would obviously be considered the weakest aspects of that piece - elements which were only mitigated by the joyous fun found in the brilliance of its subtle yet witty satire and its surprisingly well-developed characters. These pieces of the puzzle are now missing. Though this picture is, at times, passively entertaining, what we're left with is a fairly by-the-numbers 'save the world' plot and a string of odd action set-pieces seemingly incompetently put together. There's abhorrent use of rampant speed ramping that makes things literally look like someone hit the fast-forward button, and haphazardly stitched-together short takes that are supposed to make some sequences look like one fluid shot but instead make them look like cheap cartoons. In his quest to ignore the naysayers, Vaughn disappointingly squanders all of the good will he had built with his predecessor and bizarrely wipes the slate clean relatively early on, wasting time setting up a less interesting new set of characters instead of working with the better characters already expertly established at the end of the prior title. He also reintroduces a previously dead character (seen in the trailers), after making him an amnesiac no less, in a move that should be reserved only for a waning franchise at least five films in that's struggling to maintain its relevancy, not for what was once perhaps the most promising new property in Hollywood. 5/10.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
31,bowmanblue,Moore 'Bond' than Craig!,9,21 October 2017,"The words 'pleasantly surprised' always came to mind when I watched 'Kingsman: The Secret Service.' I was always more taken with the slightly cheeky Roger Moore era of the Bond franchise, before it all turned uber-serious courtesy of Daniel Craig. Therefore, I was delighted to see great stunts, ridiculous gardens and over-the-top villains hiding in hollowed-out volcanos (or the like). Now, I'm even more delighted to say that the sequel is actually pretty good, too. Yes, you can always argue that the sequel will never topple the original (Empire Strikes Back, Godfather II, Aliens and T2 excluded), but, as far as sequels go, this one stays pretty much true to the spirit of the first and is definitely worth a watch if you like spy movies in general, or – like me – are stuck in the past in the Connery/Moore Bond era.In case you're not up on the first movie, you don't really have to be as this one stands alone quite nicely as well. It's about a super secret English spy agency that masquerades as a tailor's in the middle of London. However, one sunny day someone goes and drops bombs on all but one of the Kingsmen agents, leaving the last man standing to flee across the pond and join his counterparts in America, aka The Statesmen (and find out who was behind it all, obviously). It's good to see all of the cast have returned for this one (even ones you may not think should be in there, but that goes into 'spoiler' territory) which is always nice to see. And it's equally nice to see that the film isn't afraid to kill off characters who you may not expect to see go out in the way that they do. Not only do the Kingsmen and Statesmen have to find out who blitzed the London agents, but also stop Julianne Moore from distributing drugs that will poison the world while they're at it. Now, despite my overall praise and enjoyment of the film, I felt that Julianne Moore was possibly the weakest element. Not because she was an especially bad villain – she's a great actress and did everything she could to appear as menacing to the world's population as possible, but she had one hell of a tough act to follow – Mr Samuel L Jackson. He was so crazy (and brilliant!) in the original that anyone was going to struggle when following in his footsteps.However, that's just a minor gripe. You could say that if you've seen one spy movie then you've seen them all – i.e. a super villain wants to do X and the hero must stop him, then insert a few high-octane car chases and fist fights along the way. Well, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' doesn't offer anything particularly new by going against that formula. It's simply the way it's done that sets it apart from the rest. It's silly, light-hearted fun, but at the same time is able to dip effortlessly into the action genre and also provide some genuine heart-felt moments. I hope we definitely at least get a trilogy out of this franchise. Dark, gritty Bond is okay if you're in the mood to be mega serious, but for those of us who still like our spy thrillers a little more light-hearted, then Kingsman is definitely the way forward.About the only major thing that jarred with me was some really noticeable CGI backdrops, but the action scenes were so well-shot that these more than made up for the Glastonbury festival that was blatantly created on a PC.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
32,ThomasDrufke,Doubles Down on the Insanity,6,23 September 2017,"As if it's never been said before, sequels are almost an impossible feat for directors, especially ones that nearly reinvented the genre upon the release of the first film. Kingsman The Secret Service was a pleasant surprise in early 2015, proving that there's still room for originality in adapting comic book properties. However, The Golden Circle pretty much doubles down on every insane aspect of the first film, all while throwing out the heart and soul that was impressively touched upon in the first.Now I'm not going as far as saying I don't like the film, I actually enjoyed the theater experience, but it just feels like a disappointing renewal of the property. What felt fresh in Secret Service, feels like a complete re-hash. Julianne Moore plays Poppy, an infamous drug lord who spends her days on an island no one knows how to reach. She decides to use her power to infect a good portion of the world's population in an attempt to convince the President to stop the war on drugs. On one hand, it's the type of crazy plot that served the first Kingsman well, but on the other hand, it's PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT SAME PLOT AS THE FIRST FILM. And it plays out in almost exactly the same way.If you're going to bring back Colin Firth as an emotional connection to Eggsy, then why not somehow tie the villain into Firth somehow? Poppy does her fair share of evil things to Eggsy, but I feel like even those losses aren't anything that made me feel bad for Eggsy. Instead, I just got ticked off at the events that took place. I just can't get behind some of the character choices that the writers made. That's not even mentioning the problem I have with bringing Firth back in the first place. It's exactly the same problem I have with Marvel bringing Coulson back. The whole point is that these characters are motivated to defeat their enemies because of the losses they go through. You just can't wipe away a major event because the character is beloved by fans.Enough ranting, though. The Kingsman are joined by The Statesman here as their pursuit of Poppy leads them to team up with their counterparts to defeat a common enemy. With that conjunction, comes new characters to like played by Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal, Halle Berry, and Jeff Bridges. All good actors, but besides Pascal, none of them get a whole lot to do. Pascal is the clear standout, with a whip as a weapon (which is basically an Indiana Jones lasso on steroids), with Tatum having a cool action sequence and Bridges having a few typically chill Bridges lines.The film is also 12 minutes longer than the original, and you definitely feel it. When you can feel the length of an action film that doesn't have a lot of down time, then you know there's something wrong. I honestly can't pin point the reason why all of these aspects don't work in The Golden Circle but worked well in The Secret Service, other than the lack of originality and freshness. I hate when I spend an entire review (or more like a reaction) describing things I was disappointed with, when in reality, it's not a bad film at all. But sometimes it's easier to point out flaws than it is things you like because those are far more expected. Perhaps I'll appreciate the insanity more on repeated viewing.6.3/10",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

And having Julian Moore's character, Poppy, be a fun crazy drug lord. Good idea. Even Elton John had some laughs with his cameo. And it's just funny to think of a ""Poppyland"" in the middle of the Cambodian jungle. Channing Tatum was good, wished he had more air time. The movie is bascially like a satirical James Bond.

35,lesleyharris30,"Not what the Original was, Still Great Fun,",9,5 November 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It brings the fun, spontaneity and ludicrousness that made the original so enjoyable back. Like its predecessor, it has a ton of great moments that you will not be able to keep your eyes off of because of just how visually pleasing they are, as well as side splitting hilarious dialogue. It certainly has a lot flaws and I am saddened to say that, as enjoyable as it is, does not live up to its predecessor. First of all, it throws back to the first Kingsman far too much, such as characters reminiscing about the events of that movie, making references, and even going as far as to showing footage. This movie does not make sense without having seen the first, and in my opinion, a sequel should be able to stand on its own. As well as that, Channing Tatum has an underwhelming role, despite being highly advertised, he is here very briefly, I also felt Colin Firth's involvement should not have been made known. I would love to have been surprised by Harry's return, and it would have made the rest of the film a complete thrill since I would have been overwhelmed by just how much Firth is in it, but instead I was underwhelmed when his character was revealed cause he is all over the posters. The cast are in solid form, Taaron Egerton, Colin Firth and Mark Strong are still stellar in their roles, with each character having a solid arc. The new cast, while not appearing quite as much as they should have, still deliver, such as Julianne Moore, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Halle Berry and a terrific performance by Elton John as himself. Pedro Pascal was the stand out for me, I have never seen this man in any previous work, but thought he did a phenomenal job as Whiskey, with a great screen presence, terrific characterisation and an intriguing, layered personality that was a nice match up against Eggsy and Harry. Terrific fun from beginning to end. While it certainly has its imperfections that I could not help but point out as a massive fan of its predecessor, there is still certainly more good about Kingsman: The Golden Circle than there is bad, I had great fun and would recommend to anybody looking for a good comedy, action or adventure. Eggsy and Merlin must team up with American spies after their branch is destroyed and take on a woman who is looking to take the world down with her powerful drug cartel.

37,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,14 December 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden CircleThe biggest difference between British and US intelligence is which side of the road they park the surveillance van.Sadly, the spooks in this action-adventure have lost all of their spy gear.When the Kingsman organization - save for Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and his quartermaster (Mark Strong) - is wiped out by a drug baroness, Poppy (Julianne Moore), intent on poisoning her users, the surviving Kingsman get aid from their American counterpart, The Statesman (Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, Jeff Bridges).Now this ragtag team must penetrate Poppy's Cambodian stronghold before her toxin takes the lives of millions.The obligatory sequel to the groundbreaking original, this overstuffed follow-up features the same eye-popping action but ad nauseam this time. Furthermore, the cartoonishness of the violence has seeped into the script and acting, particularly Elton John's excruciating performance.Besides, if you kill all of the recreational drug users then alcoholics will run rampant.

38,tabuno,A Dizzying Hyperkinetic Action Thriller,8,9 January 2019,"24 September 2017. This hyperkinetic action thriller sequel again delivers a dizzying amount of souped up and slowed down physical action. At the same time, the screenplay has included more emotionally gut-wrenching moments that can almost bring the audience to tears. Immediately, however, the audience is jolted into attention with an almost unreal action sequence that seems to defy even screen reality in its depiction of extended mayhem.Overall the plot and set design almost seem to take James Bond movies as its inspiration except with a lot of joviality and at the same time a raw, gritty, nasty, and even sadistic delivery of willful murder with glee. The movie thus is even repulsive at times, loaded with swear words that seem to besmirch the genteel nature of the British-side of Kingsmen. The political undertones in the movie can be startling considering the contemporary nature of the reign of President Trump and surprising in the contrast to the upcoming Tom Cruise movie American Made (2017) suggesting America's connection with the international drug cartels.The movie it seems borders on somewhat of a fine balance of schizophrenic tendencies with its primary plot and its twists and wry sadistic behavior along with the British sense of humor. The audience is tossed about almost as the characters are in a spinning cable car. It is novel in its action shots and offers up an action ride of entertainment with brief scenes of sensitive emotional reflection on death, sacrifice, and even romantic betrayal and faithfulness.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
39,ironhorse_iv,"I'm sorry. As much as I found this movie to be fun to watch. It was still meh. It was highly disappointing. This sequel just wasn't, tailor made for me.",6,24 October 2017,"Director, Matthew Vaughn's over the top spy film 'Kingsman: the Secret Service', based on the comics of the same name, really did surprised me, when it came out in 2014. It had the right amount of funny amount of dark comedy, outlandish over-the-top, ultra-violent action, subversive social commentary, and oddly sweet character dynamics to make it, one of the best movies, I watched that year. However, I really can't say, the same, with its 2017's sequel. Don't get me wrong, 'Kingsman: the Golden Circle' is highly watchable, but it's just doesn't have the same charms, as the original movie, does. Much of the disappointment, comes to the fact that set pieces are a little too silly. Yes, I know, the first movie, did have some comedic moments, but there was more of a heart to it, with a ground 'coming to age' story of a troublesome youth, Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) becoming a gentleman, when face of becoming a secret agent. Here, in the sequel, I don't know, what they were going for with 'the sense of lost & the will to rebuilt' as the main theme. They already done it. It been explore, better with the first movie, with the death of his mentor, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) & the destruction of the Kingsman, under his hand. So, the attacks on the Kingsman by the drug dealer/terrorist, Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) in the beginning of the movie, felt nothing, but a tasteless rethread for me. It kinda sucks, because I was really, hoping for the sequel to build and explore more on the relationships, that Eggsy has establish with the rest of the Kingsman like Merlin (Mark Strong), Amelia (Fiona Hampton) & Roxy (Sophie Cookson). Instead, those characters felt, badly misused & wasted; for more screen time for minor characters in the first movie like Princess Tilde (Hanna Alström), whom now has a strong relationship with 'Eggsy'. I guess, the writers are trying to right, a wrong from the first movie, by giving the throwaway joke character, more depth. Still, her character is play off, for laughs. So, in short, there wasn't much improvement. Her force relationship with 'Eggsy' doesn't seem romantic or genuine. It was mostly, a waste of time. Another big problem with the sense of lost & the will to rebuilt, message to the bizarre way, they brought back, Henry Hart for this movie. I thought, it was a mistake. Look, I love Colin Firth as this character, but having him, reappear, through a stupid, 'get out of free card' out of place 'ex-Machina' device, after, getting shot in the head is really stupid. It kinda ruins the purpose of understanding lost, and dealing with it. Plus, how is this, 'ex-Machina' device, not use for everybody!? Lots of Americans were shot in the head, during the last movie's neurological wave broadcast. Where were the 'Statesman' alpha-gel then? In short, having them, rescue Harry is a farce. I thought, his presence should had been save, for only flashbacks to build more, emotional ground. As for fresh outrageous, highly stereotypical 'Americans' characters that makes up, 'Eggsy' new heroic team, they seem more like caricatures than real people. Don't get me wrong, I do like characters like Jack Daniels / Whiskey (Pedro Pascal), Tequila (Channing Tatum), Champagne (Jeff Bridges) & Ginger Ale (Halle Berry), but I felt like, they would work better, as the fictional modern version of real-life secret society, the Knights of the Golden Circle, due to their antebellum style hospitality, and alcohol funded presence. Wouldn't it, make more sense for 'The Statesman' to be, more sinister; by giving money to Poppy, secretly in order to keep alcohol as American Number 1 drug even if it's more deadly & dangerous, by ordering her to poison her own drug users & publicly fighting against her, rather than leaving the jarring plot-hole of Poppy destroying her own illegal business, for the off-change that US might end the 'War on Drugs'. Wouldn't that, be more interesting!? After all, it would show the hypocritical righteous nature that US has on the subject, a lot better, rather than this tongue-in-cheek, kinda shallow good vs evil exploration. Honestly, I would love to see more of that, rather than the time waster, of overused 3D technology, running jokes of Elton John saying the f-word, and pacing slowly, uncomfortable awkward sex scenes, that Vaughn and his crew have rammed down our throats!? No wonder, why the original cut was almost four hours. Even with the edits, the movie still put too much outrageous things to take this film, seriously. Making it, bigger and louder, doesn't make it, a better movie. I would love to have, something grounded. Despite the silly nature of the film, it was still good. The acting was pretty fine. The action scene, while CGI heavy was alright. The music choices were fair, even if it's looks highly stupid & gimmicky to see, Merlin do a badass rendition of artist, John Denver song's ""Country Road Take Me Home' to lure henchmen to some landmine, when the mines are remote control and could be turn off. Even, the jokes were somewhat funny, even if they overused some of it. Overall: While, 'Kingsman: the Golden Circle' doesn't live up to the hype that the first movie, have brought. It still worth checking out. It might not be King. At least, it's not a total Joker.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
40,Platypuschow,Kingsman The Golden Circle: How is this stuff so good?,8,11 May 2018,"Going into the first movie I assumed the worst, with a spate of similiar dreadful films I expected the absolute pits. A movie about a chav piece of trash becoming a secret agent? Riiiiight.Yet somehow, someway it worked. From it's fantastic supporting cast including Colin Firth and the excellent Mark Strong to the script to the hyper energetic over the top action sequences.I almost hated myself for enjoying it so much and going into The Golden Circle I kind of hoped it would fail, instead it excelled and even beat it's predecessor.With the same cast plus the additions of Jeff Bridges, Halle Berry and the entirely awful Channing Tatum the movie knocks it out of the park once again with the same formula (Now with 50% less chaviness).Our hero now takes on the evil drug baroness Julianne Moore and features lots of cameos including Elton John and Keith Allen. Robot dogs, laser lassos, killer dance drugs, all the same level of over the top'ness remain and it all works so very well.I don't want to like this franchise, I shake my fist in the air and curse to give it such a high rating again but Kingsman is pure gold.The Good:Great cast (Not you Tatum)Well writtenGreat action sequencesThe Bad:Channing TatumStill chavvy Things I Learnt From This Movie:Elton John needs to stick to singingHeadshots are easily fixed with clingfilm",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
41,The-Sarkologist,"Great, non-stop Fun",8,23 September 2017,"I would suggest that they don't make spy movies like this one but in a way they do, but not quite in the same vein. First of all this is the sequel to Kingsman: The Secret Service and the style sort of halfway between the seriousness of James Bond and the absolute ridiculousness of Austin Powers, and in a way it meets a pretty good balance. In once sense it is quite amusing, though there are a couple of scenes which are quite preposterous (such as the cure for a bullet in the head – even though they do try to explain it scientifically). However, while not being too serious, it certainly is entertaining, engaging, and certainly fits the mould of a James Bond style spy movie.The film begins sometime after the end of the first film where our hero, Eggsy, is leaving work and is attacked by one of the former Kingsmen rejects. We pretty quickly learn that the antagonist is a drug lord named Popsie who has a fetish for 1950s Americana and is hidden away in a secret base somewhere in the jungle in some undiscovered ruins that have been done up like a 1950s American small town. Her problem is that despite being a multi-billionaire, her product is still illegal, despite the fact that alcohol, tobacco, and sugar are, at least in her mind, much more lethal. As such she concocts a plan to blackmail the world into making drugs legal so that she can actually become a legitimate businesswoman.The interesting thing about this film is that it tries to look at both sides of the drug epidemic. In one sense we know that drugs are bad, and that drug lords are pretty despicable creatures, yet we also have the idea that many of the users are actually innocent victims. However not everybody sees it that way, and when it is the users that are being held to ransom, the question is suddenly raised as to who really cares. By creating a time bomb that will basically result in all drug users being killed raises the question of whether actually doing nothing is in the end a good thing.Well, on one hand, especially when it comes down to the violent junkies, then maybe it is, but the reality is that that is only one form that the drug user takes. These are the obvious examples, the scourge that seems to line our streets begging for money and committing crimes, even violent crimes, simply to fuel their habit. However the catch is that not all drug users fall into the category of junkie. In fact there are many users out there that seem to live normal and productive lives, and in fact some of our closest friends may actually be closet drug users.This is actually a huge debate that is raging, and there are people out there, as is represented by a couple of characters in the film, that simply do not believe that there is such a thing as an innocent drug user. That is understandable, particularly when we have somebody whose loved one has been the innocent victim of drug fueled violence. The other thing is that many people are able to keep their drug use hidden, and in the context of the film are only exposed when Poppy implements her plan. Yet the question still hangs over our head as to whether it is possible for somebody to maintain a drug habit and continue living a productive lifestyle. One thing that I discovered is that medical doctors, particularly surgeons, do not undergo regular drug testing.Golden Circle is a pretty intense film that keeps of moving, and draws us in, right until the end. We travel from a Music festival in England to the alps, to the heartland of the United States. We are reacquainted with old friends, and are confronted with new enemies, and even discover the sister agency in the United States. However the one thing that did annoy me was not so much the film itself, but the advertising leading up to it. Right from when I saw the first poster my interest had been captured. I really enjoyed the previous film, and I was more than keen on seeing this one. However, as we came closer more was revealed, and in a way I was a little disappointed – once I had decided that I wanted to see this film I didn't need any more teasers. As it turned out the teasers, in the end, were just that, and I was still riveted right until the end. Oh, and it didn't give too much away.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

45,tomgillespie2002,"By no means the disaster many have cited, but The Golden Circle is both silly and plain boring",4,27 December 2017,"Having directed no fewer than three comic-book adaptations with Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class and Kingsman: The Secret Service, it's a wonder director Matthew Vaughn has taken so long to deliver a sequel. Kingsman took over 400 million at the box-office and was one of the surprise successes of 2014, and with critical and audience responses both overwhelmingly positive for the My Fair Lady-meets-James Bond spy comedy, a sequel was always going to be on the cards. With The Golden Circle, Vaughn and returning screenwriter Jane Goldman have taken the route of most sequels and made everything bigger, but not necessarily better. The Golden Circle may please some fans of the original with its lashings of ultra-violence and colourful language, but I suspect many will become sickly with the film's desire to throw everything at the screen to see what sticks.A year on from preventing Samuel L. Jackson's plan to wipe out the majority of the world's population using mania-inducing SIM cards, and Eggsy (Taron Egerton) has settled well within the ranks of the Kingsman and has shacked up with Princess Tilde of Sweden (Hanna Alstrom). One night he is attacked by a former foe he had long thought dead: Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft), the failed Kingsman applicant believed to have perished in the head-exploding finale of the previous film. Charlie is alive and well, and has been fitted with a hi-tech bionic arm capable of brute strength. Eggsy manages to overcome Charlie, but the severed arm hacks its way into the Kingsman's computer system. Soon enough, the majority of Britain's finest secret service has been taken out by long-range missiles. Along with Merlin (Mark Strong), Eggsy travels to the U.S. to investigate a clue left in the agency's Doomsday protocol, and discover a sister agency named the Statesman led by the gruff Champagne (Jeff Daniels).The Statesman are like the Kingsman, only instead of bespoke suits and good table manners, they dress like cowboys and have nicknames based on alcoholic beverages. Channing Tatum's Tequila is first to greet them, and is understandably suspicious of this shadowy agency operating without their knowledge. There's also Whiskey (Pedro Pascal), and Merlin-equivalent tech genius Ginger Ale (Halle Berry). The bad guy this time around is Poppy (Julianne Moore), a Martha Stewart-like drug baron hiding out in Cambodia. Her master plan is to infect all users of her various drugs with a toxin that will soon cause their deaths unless the U.S. President puts an end to the War on Drugs. Poppy's outlandish plan, which would seem to damage Poppy's trade if successful or offer the President a chance to rid the world of drug abusers and Poppy's customers, is one of many problems with The Golden Circle. Armed with robot dogs and a kidnapped Elton John in an appearance that goes way beyond mere cameo, Vaughn and Goldman seem happy to suck out all sense of reality for this sequel, and with it have considerably lowered the stakes.The movie's most glaring problem, however, is the return of Colin Firth's Harry Hart. Most of us were shocked and saddened when he received a bullet to the face from Samuel L. Jackson following the original's most spectacular scene, but to bring him back feels cheap, removing any sense of peril in the process. The action scenes, which involve everything from an electric whip to a man-chomping meat-grinder, rely heavily on CGI. The Secret Service did this too, but it also used practical effects to retain a sense of physicality when Harry was hacking, shooting and burning his way through a Church full of bigoted psychopaths. The newcomers all do well despite being left in the background for the majority of the running-time, with Tatum especially barely registering before he is placed into a coma. Highlights include Egerton's beautiful jaw-line and Strong's deadpan Merlin, but there is little resembling the freshness of the first film, which also managed to keep its outrageous ambitions in check by structuring the plot around Eggsy's Kingsman training. The Golden Circle is by no means the disaster many critics have cited, but by striding to take things to the next level, Vaughn has made Kingsman both cringe-inducingly silly and plain boring.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
46,cruise01,"Silly, insane fun action that tinkers with the spy genre but lacking from the first movie.",7,23 September 2017,"Matthew Vaughn has a sense of style, humor, and fun creative direction with the action in his movies. Sure, there are moments were he may push the boundaries with the plot themes or the humor. But it is all purely fun. Like the first Kingsman movie were it was all fun, messing with the spy genre, using a plot device about cell cards implanted in people, and a violent brutal scene involving inside the church. Kingsman: The Golden Circle does just about all that again. New plot theme, fun humor, and some crazy fast paced loud action. It may not be as fun as the first movie but it is entertaining. And it is why we go to the theatres for some popcorn fun flicks. Matthew Vaughn may suffer from the sequel lacking in being better than the first. Either from some long pause stretches in the second act, were Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is trying to follow up on a lead from a drug dealer named Poppy (Julianne Moore). She is selling drugs that will have a nasty side effect that will affect millions of people. And profit in selling the antidote. Eggsy will need the help from the statesman led by Jeff Bridges and the two agents played by Channing Tatum and Pedro Pascal. I love the creativity that the British Kingsman is mannered differently than the Statemans. Were every agent is named after an alcohol beverage. Kingsman does offer some crazy insane fun action sequences. From the opening car chase to the snowy mountain fight. The fight scenes are fast and can be brutal. So do be prepared for people entering a meat grinder and the villain making a hamburger from the grinded meat. Talking about villain. Julianne Moore was a great and fun addition as the villain. Having her own fortress in the middle of the forest named Poppy Land. Which has a look of the 1960s town. With robotic dogs and guards. Some other fun additions like Channing Tatum being part of the mix but sat on the sideline for most of the movie. But Pedro Pascal being more involved in the action with his power controlled lasso. The Golden Circle still has plenty of fun to be had. Sure, there are some raunchy humor were Eggsy was suppose to plant a tracking device inside one of the villains girlfriend. And also a sub plot of Eggsy and his girlfriend Princess Tilde from the last movie were he rescued her, were he is trying to keep a healthy honest relationship. And another sub plot beware spoiler alert (it was shown in trailers) of Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong) trying to bring back Harry (Colin Firth) memories after the incident in the last movie. A lot tries to go on for this sequel. All while the Kingsman are trying to stop Poppy from killing millions. Besides the loud exciting fast action. I feel like the movie does over use its cgi to the part were it could be overbearing in some of the action sequences. The visual effects were decent and noticeable on some parts. But if you can overlook that and enjoy for what it is. It is worth seeing on the big screen. Overall, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a fairly entertaining action spy film. It has some creative loud fun action. Can be overbearing with the cheesy cgi. The plot is fun and the humor is entertaining. Some new characters are fun and also Elton John making an appearance. It does get slow and boring in the second act when it is trying to do so much in the plot. I rate the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen for the action and if you enjoyed the first movie.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
47,Floated2,A letdown but still entertaining,6,12 May 2019,"Having watched the original Kingsman film and it being both a surprise success and critical hit, this sequel was one of the more anticipated films of 2017.Now watching the Golden Circle and seeing a lot of negative reviews, where most the criticism comes from the fact it isn't as good as the original. Which may be true but as a film, the Golden Circle is still a fun ride and worth a watch.The tone is slightly different and this film is longer and feels as such, but there are more characters so it makes sense.The action is still slick and stylish but the plot does somewhat drag a little and isn't that interesting.Though overall not completely disappointed by this film, was not expecting it to be as good as the original any way.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
48,eddie_baggins,Not as surprising as the original but The Golden Circle still offers a wild ride,6,21 September 2017,"The release of Kingsman: The Secret Service in 2014 surprised us all.Based on a relatively obscure comic book series, Matthew Vaughan's ultra-violent and wickedly depraved action comedy was a breath of fresh air for cinema-goers with its inventively over the top action, larger than life characters and unique approach to its genre sparking glowing audience reactions and a box-office haul north of $400 million dollars.With audiences clambering for more Kingsman action, Vaughan and his team return for the Golden Circle, a sequel that doesn't sully the name of the original but one that also feels rather bloated in parts and loses the element of surprise that made the first Kingsman such an unexpectedly wild ride.Clocking in at roughly 140 minutes, Golden Circle sees Taron Egerton's Eggsy and Mark Strong's Merlin make a trip to the USA in search of their sister-agency The Statesman, after their British safe houses are destroyed by Julianne Moore's lunatic drug baron Poppy.Recruiting newcomers Pedro Pascal, Channing Tatum, Halle Berry and the Texan-drawl slinging Jeff Bridges along with the returning Colin Firth, The Golden Circle freshens things up in a cast sense but keeps the formula very much the same, as the two agencies look to uncover the truth behind Poppy's nefarious plans to hold the world hostage via a deadly drug strand.The most glaringly obvious thing about Golden Circle and the return to this crazy world is the fact it's nowhere near as funny The Secret Service.It's not to say there aren't laughs in Golden Circle (and a particularly long winded pop star cameo); they can often be found in circumstances and situations that shouldn't be humorous which is a staple of Vaughan's works, but it doesn't balance the act of action and comedy as well as Vaughan's first Kingsman ride.At well over the two hour mark, those expecting a bullet-a-minute action extravaganza as well will be a little disappointed. Things start out with a bang with a thrilling car chase and there are sporadically scattered action scenes throughout but those expecting a finale as eye popping as the first film or even a scene that matches it with famous church fight from the original will be left disappointed.It's possible we were just spoilt by Vaughan's first foray into the Kingsman universe as the ability for the film to remove itself from reality yet remain grounded around robot dogs and dancing drug addled victims with glaring blue veins is quiet the feat, while Vaughan's handiwork when the action kicks up is second-to-none, and even though the film could've chopped a further 30 minutes in the editing suite, it's hard not to enjoy a frenetic finale in a bizarre 50's Americana setting while seeing renowned actors like Julianne Moore having such fun with their roles makes sure Golden Circle is always a cut-above even when its flirting the line of losing itself within its self-created whirlpool of colour and insanity.Final Say – Ticking all the Kingsman boxes that fans of the original will be seeking to check off, The Golden Circle may not provide on the same level of the first film but anyone that loved Eggsy's debut in the high body count adventure will enjoy this new trip, while those that weren't fans should stay very far away from this freshly minted exercise in the hyper-real and super energized spy caper.3 freshly cooked burgers out of 5",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Being a fan of the first movie, I was really looking forward to seeing how Eggsy (Taron Egerton) had progressed as an agent but now that I've seen the movie, it just felt the same as the original Kingsman. Don't get me wrong, there are some great action scenes, and the some of the new characters were a great addition to the franchise but the concept seemed to follow the same guidelines as the first one, and a lot of the action scenes were really far fetched. The director also killed off all of the interesting characters, and I missed the Eggsy's ""bad boy"" image, which was what made the original movie so great. Anyway, in this movie Eggsy is forced to takedown the most powerful woman in the world, Poppy (Julianne Moore), after one of her agents, who went to the same training school as Eggsy, threatens to kill him. Poppy then users all of her powers to destroy the Kingsman agency, so Eggsy joins forces with his old agency pal, Merlin (Mark Strong) to revenge his fallen comrades, while he's building a new life with his girlfriend Princess Tilde (Hanna Alstrom). All of the clues track them to another agency in Kentucky, called the Statesman, and while they are using there resources to track down Poppy, they come across there old agency pal Harry Hart (Colin Firth), who was saved by the Statesman when he got shot in the eye. Poppy, who gained her wealth from selling drugs around the world, is fed up with being in hiding in the middle of nowhere, so she puts a killer drug into her drugs and threatens the president that she will kill everyone if he doesn't legalise her drugs. Confusing but pretty straight forward! Although the president doesn't care if all of the criminals die or not, the agency are out to save the world, so they hunt for the antidote, which will also save Eggsy's girlfriend who has taken Poppy's lethal drug. I liked the new characters from the Statesman agency, especially Tequila (Channing Tatum) and Whiskey (Pedro Pascal), and Champ was a great choice for the head of there agency but I don't think that we have seen the most from that agency yet. I was impressed with the attention to detail, and some of the gadgets, like the suitcase and the umbrella, were great but the character building wasn't that great because there was way to much going on. None of the new characters had a back story and the new agency seemed to pop out of nowhere. With that aside, it's quite an entertaining film and it's non-stop from the beginning to end but I still prefer the first movie for it's originality and wit. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Matthew Vaughn, 46, who also brought you Layer Cake in 2004, Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class and the original Kingsman. He also produced Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Mean Machine, Harry Brown, The Debt, Fantastic Four and Eddie The Eagle, so he's had quite an impressive career to date. It's always hard to make a sequel to a successful movie, so I can understand the pressure that he was under to make this film, which is why he decided to introduce an American agency. Personally I liked the fact that the first movie was based in England, because the whole focus was on Eggsy, who was trying to become a well spoken person, coming from a bad boy background. Now that he has found his feet, it seemed more like a old school Bond film but the director tried to stay true to the characters by bringing back Harry Hart, who was pretty distant through the whole film. Elton John made me laugh throughout the movie and Julianne Moore was perfect as the villain but I still was expecting more from this sequel.Budget: $104million

I was impressed with the attention to detail, and some of the gadgets, like the suitcase and the umbrella, were great but the character building wasn't that great because there was way to much going on. None of the new characters had a back story and the new agency seemed to pop out of nowhere. With that aside, it's quite an entertaining film and it's non-stop from the beginning to end but I still prefer the first movie for it's originality and wit. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Matthew Vaughn, 46, who also brought you Layer Cake in 2004, Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class and the original Kingsman. He also produced Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Mean Machine, Harry Brown, The Debt, Fantastic Four and Eddie The Eagle, so he's had quite an impressive career to date. It's always hard to make a sequel to a successful movie, so I can understand the pressure that he was under to make this film, which is why he decided to introduce an American agency. Personally I liked the fact that the first movie was based in England, because the whole focus was on Eggsy, who was trying to become a well spoken person, coming from a bad boy background. Now that he has found his feet, it seemed more like a old school Bond film but the director tried to stay true to the characters by bringing back Harry Hart, who was pretty distant through the whole film. Elton John made me laugh throughout the movie and Julianne Moore was perfect as the villain but I still was expecting more from this sequel.Budget: $104million

51,TheMovieDiorama,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is bonkers, crazy and ridiculously fun.",7,27 February 2018,"If you thought the first instalment was absurdly silly, well good luck with this one! Matthew Vaughn has taken the spy genre and turned it up by 9000. I'm talking a taxi that transforms from a normal car, to a speedy car to a submarine. A suitcase that acts as a gun, body shield and missile launcher all-in-one. Even a whip that becomes a lasso that cuts through people. This pretty much explains director Vaughn's problem, he went too far. Like a mad man not knowing when to stop. Unfortunately he did not put his resources and ingenuity into the plot. A deluded business woman called Poppy Adams has devised a recreational drug that will kill everyone who consumes it through a gruelling four stage process (that does include dancing). It's up to the disbanded Kingsman to join their American brothers, Statesman, to stop her and save the world. Eggsy also has a girlfriend. Harry is still alive (completely shoe-horned in). The President of America sees this problem as a solution, as it terminates all the drug users in the world. So yes, it's rather over stuffed but fortunately it's 140 minutes long so it never feels too rushed. Just messy. However I cannot deny that I was thoroughly entertained and thought the pacing was consistently good. All performances were enjoyable, particularly Mark Strong and Taron Egerton (who finally has his name on the poster this time around). Julianne Moore was wasted, I absolutely despise an action film where the antagonist is just there to further the plot! Valentine was so good in its predecessor that he is constantly referenced with multiple expositional scenes. Adams was just a wasted character and her demise was borderline lazy. To counteract this, we have Elton John. Yes, Sir Elton John. Incredibly hilarious. Ridiculously stupid. I loved it. If a film can have him enter a scene grinning whilst ""Rocket Man"" plays...well it's just a winner. The action was well executed with Vaughn's visual flair garnished on top. A decent sequel, just no where near as brilliant as the first.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
52,Tweetienator,Steep Fall,5,26 November 2017,"The first Kingsman: The Secret Service movie was really a surprisingly great movie and very entertaining like the first Deadpool movie. So I was really excited about the new one.But boy, what disappointment The Golden Circle is. Everything that I liked in the first movie - the humor, the action, the characters, the story, has gone that fast stale in the 2nd movie - the first movie was a great positive surprise, the 2nd one is a great negative one. Alone the fighting scene in the church in The Secret Service is more worth than all of The Golden Circle.I won't say that this movie is a total disaster, but after half an hour or so I was bored watching and relieved after the movie was done and I left the cinema and could get a good shot of fresh air. Anyway, imo The Golden Circle got too much CGI and not enough story, and the fun/humor felt forced or uninspired, and the action scenes are all just fx. Well, I survived the movie unharmed, that's the good news.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

56,Vartiainen,"Not as good as the first one, but still very enjoyable",8,31 July 2021,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle picks up the story about a year after the first film. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is now a proper Kingsman, but unfortunately things go sideways forcing him and Merlin (Mark Strong) to flee across the pond to the US. There they meet a surprising old friend.I like a lot of things this film does. I like the Statesmen as a concept and I absolutely love that they're named after alcoholic drinks as opposed to figures from Arthurian legends. That's just so quintessentially American. I also like that the action scenes are still simply superb. Fantastic use of slow-mo, good and clean choreographies, excellent use of space. All that jazz. Just as good as in the original, if not better.That being said, I do not like how this film feels the need to raise the stakes so much that it actively makes it harder for the franchise to continue because they burn down so many bridges in their search for maximum drama.Julianne Moore is also a fine actor, but I have a bit of a hard time buying her as a villain.Still, as far as comedic spy action films go, this is still crème de la crème.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
57,jamesrupert2014,Weak and overly-long sequel,5,17 February 2019,"The Kingsmen and their American allies take on a supervillain who has introduced a pestilence into the world's supply of illegal narcotics. As a CGI-driven spy-spoof comedy, the film is a misfire. Novelty and some interesting characters made the first Kingsmen film fairly entertaining, but I quickly tired of this iteration's foul-mouthed silliness. The new story focuses on Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton) (who I didn't find to be particularly interesting in the first film) and Merlin (Mark Strong, who is OK) and their nemesis, Poppy Adams (a ludicrously over-the-top character hammed up by Julianne Moore). The story is pretty silly and the stunts, gunplay, fights, and chases defy even the most forgiving cartoon physics. As action comedies go, I didn't find the script particularly funny and the broader 'shock-humour' profanity and sight-gags began to wear thin early on in the 140 minute movie (although I did like Elton John's extended cameo).",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Is this has good has the first, well yes and no. Taron Egerton really comes alive has Eggsy, not quite James Bond, but an awesome agent, I like the way he was played has likable three dimensional. Mark Strong was good has Merlin, also nice to see Colin Firth return has Harry, and yeah there is explanation. Action scenes are well shot, and it just has violent has the first one. Now what I didn't like is Julianne Moore has the villain, although Moore does give it her all, but her motives never come across has a threat, the way the villain in the first film where. And it's a shame to see such talented actors like Jeff Bridges, Halle Berry, and Channing Tatum be so underused. There is a bowling scene in the film with Moore, I wonder if that was supposed to be a reference to The Big Lebowski? One more thing, if you remember the film Teen Wolf(1985), I just have to say Mark Arnold who played the bully Mick in that film, has a small role in this film, if you blink you might miss him.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
59,stevendbeard,Should Have Been A Summer Movie,7,22 September 2017,"I saw ""Kingsman:The Golden Circle"", starring Taron Egerton-Eddie the Eagle, Legend; Halle Berry-Kidnap, the X-Men movies; Jeff Bridges-Hell or High Water, The Big Lebowski and Julianne Moore-The Hunger Games movies, The Big Lebowski. This is a sequel to the 2014 surprise hit. In case you forgot, it is based on a comic book series about a sophisticated British spy organization-think a fancy James Bond. Taron was an unsophisticated street punk that was recruited in the first one and groomed into being a gentleman's agent. This one starts with the Kingsman being targeted by Julianne-the leader of a big drug cartel- and almost completely eliminated but Taron survives, only to discover there is an American version of the Kingsman in Kentucky called The Statesman. Jeff is in charge and Halle is his computer expert that just wants to become a field agent. Both organizations team up to track down Julianne in the Cambodian jungles. Oh yeah, the Golden Circle is Julianne's organization-she tattoos a golden circle on her employees-and she likes to dabble in robotics. She has two robot dogs and fixes her henchmen up with robotic arms. There is plenty of action, car chases, fight scenes...... It should have been a summer movie. There is a big name rock star that gets kidnapped by Julianne and he gets to have his own fight scene-wait til you see him do a flying side-kick-and of course, he does some of his songs. It's rated ""R"" for violence, drug content, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes. Even though it was a little long at almost 2 1/2 hours-it could have used a little editing-I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

61,alindsay-al,A good sequel that keeps up with the tone from the first film,7,30 September 2017,"I really enjoyed the first kingsman film back in 2015 and was very excited for this film, I enjoyed this film but like a lot of sequels these days it doesn't live up to the original. The premise of the film sees after suffering a heavy blow eggsy reaches out to the American organisation statesman to help him take down an international drug lord. Taron egerton really became a star when he starred in the first film and he is fantastic in this film. There isn't so much depth to his character in this one but he owns his new role with a strong likable charismatic performance. The supporting cast is heavy in this film, unfortunately the trailer spoiled that Colin firth is back in this film and what do you expect that he is very good in the film. He is also very charismatic and charming in the film which helps because I feel like he wasn't very necessary in this film which I will talk about later. Mark strong reprises his role as merlin in this film and he is just a top quality actor, he is great in this film and his chemistry with eggsy is even better in this film. Julianne moore plays the villain poppy in this film and she is ridiculously over the top in this film but I can't deny that it is a lot of fun to watch in this film, even though I do miss Samuel l jacksons valentine. Jeff bridges, halle berry and channing tatum are all in this film in smaller roles and they all do really good jobs in the film. A special shout out has to go to Pedro pascal in this film as he is easily my favourite part of this film. He is so awesome in the action scenes and ridiculously charismatic in the film. The story is more over the top then the first one if that can be believed and what I liked was the relationship between the kingsman and the statesman in this film that was fun to see these different people try to coexist. However, this film has the same problem a lot of sequels have by trying to do way too much in this film when it comes to its story. There is so much going on that it is hard to keep track of everything and care about everything in the film. The overall plot is also pretty by the numbers and weak a complaint I had about the first film. The script has some great humour in it that will have you laughing quite a bit. I feel like the dramatic dialogue never really went far enough and very rarely did I buy into the serious moments in this film. The style of the film is very hyperactive with some great stylistic action scenes used. But this film has a big problem which is its pacing, this film feels like 3 hours long which it isn't, I feel like a good 20 mins could have been cut from the film. Overall kingsman the golden circle is a fun decent sequel that should be seen but accepted as a weaker film then the first one.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

67,kluseba,Vividly stereotypical fun ride with obvious filmmaking and plot mistakes,7,30 November 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is an energetic roller coaster ride similar to the first instalment three years earlier. It's basically a reinvention of the James Bond franchise for younger generations, especially teenagers and young adults. The mixture of relentless action, British humor, a tiny shot of eroticism, exotic locations, twisted scenarios and spectacular special effects still works very well. What makes the Kingsman franchise special are the young and geeky main character, the connection to contemporary phenomenons such as social media activities and robotics as well as a more extreme mixture between situation comedy to lighten things up and visually explicit images to impress younger generations.There are only a few minor elements that are wrong with this sequel which is on the same level as the predecessor. First of all, the movie includes a few continuity mistakes such as car doors getting torn off just to look perfectly intact one shot later. This shows that the filmmaking process was slightly rushed and sloppy. Secondly, the movie overuses the use of stereotypes about the differences between American and British cultures. Especially the song Take Me Home, Country Roads by John Denver is overused in this film, especially since the movie takes mostly place in Kentucky and not in West Virginia. Thirdly and most importantly, the plot is also somewhat incoherent. It never becomes obvious why Harry suspects Whiskey to be a traitor. The idea that the villain placed antidotes in secret locations all around the world without even one of them being discovered is quite ridiculous as well. The way the Kingsmen finally discover Poppy's hideout in Cambodia doesn't make much sense either.In the end, Kingsma: The Golden Circle is an energizing, entertaining and fast-paced spy flick for teenagers and young adults. If you are open to pardon some obvious filmmaking and plot mistakes and just want to switch your brain off, you will certainly enjoy this slightly shallow film for what it is. I really liked the vivid ride but I wouldn't consider this film or the franchise a contemporary classic as many other people seem to do. It's fun but lacking substance to be more than just that.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Its humour works a little better but fundamentally its still wall to wall exposition with next to no real plot in sight.On a purely visual/action level the new Kingman outing it works well enough. There's some real polish in the action sequences with humour that is very much of the visual variety.That said there is no real story as such .Its more the tired ""good guy(s) vs bad girl arch villain"" formula with our Eliza Doolittle/Dell Boy social climbing spy hero going on yet another kill fest to make the word a better place....or at least that's the idea....A half hearted watch at best that's superficially entertaining but lacks the comedic depth provided by a decent narrative/story to amount to anything more.Five out of ten from me.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
69,adamjohns-42575,Wednesday night's alright for fighting,7,21 September 2020,"I do like this film, although it isn't as good as its predecessor. Perhaps it is trying too hard to bridge the gap across the Atlantic? Having said that, I did like the way that the Americans were supporting the brits for a change, without being the focus of the film. I'm not sure how it was dealt with in the comic book, but it seemed to be trying to hard here. Elton John of course adds a very British element, the humour is definitely ours, a great cameo.Maybe, there were too many characters in this one? Could my spirit animal, Channing Tatum, have been brought in at the end as a teaser for the next film and only mentioned as a Statesman who had the blue sickness? It would have added an excitement for the next film, slightly more than putting him in the deep freeze, before he even got to do much, did in this one. I love that man. I'm not sure I could pick between him and Taron though if I was asked to?I felt at times that it was less secret service and more super hero as they face an enemy with a robot arm and join forces with a man who has an electric lasso?

71,AudioFileZ,Continues The Hyper Realized Action With Intelligent Humor,7,18 October 2017,"To cut to the chase if you liked the first Kingsman you will probably be on-board and like this second in the franchise. While the ""out-there"" quality of the first is intact the element of freshness due to being original and uniquely different isn't so much. It hardly matters for those of who found the original so entertaining since the core idea is strong enough to do that once again. That isn't to say the writers aren't trying to inject some creative left turns one of which a parallel US agency to The Kingsman called Statesman. It's a good idea with lots of it's own whack comedy. And supporting that is Jeff Bridges as head of the US agency. If like me you usually find Jeff a great addition then I think you'll be pleased even with his limited screen time. In fact it's limited screen time that mines gold. Elton John plays an exaggerated version of himself as a captive on an island by the evil Julianna Moore. These two roles are over-the-top funny and good. The story is just a vehicle for the two agencies to fight evil and it works well with the cast and the technically superior absolutely insane action scenes that are as much a part of a Statesman movie as anything. This is just more of what we all liked and for this fan it isn't a sophomore slump as the creative casting and insane mirror agency addition works well. Great for fans and entertaining action probably makes it fine for most others.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

74,jadepietro,Going in Circles,4,28 September 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: It's the time between the violent action scenes that cannot fight the boredom and inanity of a silly plot.SYNOPSIS: A British spy tries to stop world domination and joins forces with his American counterparts.The rising body count and messy carnage is the only thing that is remotely dramatic in this sequel, Kingsmen: The Golden Circle, an over-the-top spy circus. Everything about this action thriller wants to be cool, laid-back, and suave. But this hipster's remake of the 2015 highly profitable forerunner isn't. Bereft of humor and wit, the film is a non-stop assault on your senses and your patience.The stunts are still eye-popping, and Matthew Vaughn knows his way around directing an action flick. But the story makes little sense and never follows any logic...how else do you explain previously dead characters reanimated and sporting a license to kill and a great wardrobe. Just as before, the graphic violence upends the fun. Back with us is Eggsy (Taron Egerton), now renamed Gallahad, and an active member of the Kingsmen, a secret society of agents. He and his league of gentlemen must stop a drug lord curiously named Poppy (Julianne Moore) from destroying the inner sanctum and systemically infecting the world population with a virus. Soon Eggsy and his cohort Merlin (Mark Strong) are off to America to rally some Allied forces from Dixie. Halle Berry, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, and Pedro Pascal play these roles. Even Sir Elton John makes an appearance.All the relentless action cannot hide that old boys' club entitlement mentality and the misogynistic attitude that seemed to hearken back to the 60's era that are at work in the screenplay by Jane Goldman and the director which never rises above a leer. Granted the action sequences are well staged, very Guy Ritchie stylized movement, with its use of slo-mo and quick edited cuts to emphasize the kinetic effect, but the lull of a plot between the adrenaline rush of the fight scenes grows tedious and unintentionally laughable. The tone of the film jumps wildly from serious espionage thriller to spy spoof, as if the director cannot decide which genre he wants to do.The prestigious cast is less than serviceable. Academy Award winners like Ms. Berry and Mr. Bridges are totally wasted. Ms. Moore gives a truly awful performance (the first of which I never thought possible from this gifted performer). Mr. Tatum's role is basically a walk-on. Mr. Pascal does carry that Burt Reynolds 70's swagger well and Mr. Strong and Colin Firth reprise their roles with a touch of class and have a nice rapport with Mr. Egerton. And Elton John is an embarrassment, looking foolish and losing any shred of dignity. Why he would choose to participate in this goofy venture boggles the mind!But its the lazy storytelling, as the plot becomes more and more absurd, that dooms the movie. It resembles a poor man's version of a bad James Bond movie...the Roger Moore smirking variety, or more like those 60's trashy and sexist Matt Helm series starring Dean Martin, at their worse. The film constantly trades in class for crass. Kingsman: The Golden Circle keeps running in circles. It's fool's gold and nothing more.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
75,rgkarim,King Me...Again,8,21 September 2017,"""Manners, Maketh, Man!"" Such an elegant phrase that got millions all fired up years ago in preparation for the spy action flick of the season. Kingsman was a smashing success back in the day for me, and when I saw a sequel coming, I may have squealed in glee a tiny bit. Yet, I feared that a sequel could smudge the adventure I enjoyed so much, especially with the expanded cast. So tonight, I put on my suit (or t-shirt) and hit the theater to scope out the next mission. Was the mission a success? Read on to find out friends. LIKES:Funny: Remember that edgy humor the first Kingsman had? Well the magic continues my friends, as Kingsman2 is certainly Golden in much of its comedic bite. It starts like always with the banter between agents, well-timed and well-delivered by our cast to maximize the punch at hand. Then comes the reactions of our agents as their thrown ridiculous curve balls, or baseballs at points, meant to hinder their way. Yet the cameo by a certain celebrity might have been a major source of gut busting guffaws. I won't reveal who it is (I leave that to the Internet), but get ready to laugh so hard you might cry with his ""rock n roll' themed lines. Emotional: Surprisingly, Kingsman 2 may be more heart wrenching than the first movie. Eggsy's next stage of life has more than enough sad moments that will slow the adrenaline ride down, like those stubborn speedbumps in a parking lot, or a Game of Thrones episode. Character development is certainly stronger than ever in this movie, pushing our lead protagonist to levels we never really thought he would have to face. All these challenges keep you invested in Eggsy, Merlin, and others for the second round, making for a more immersive experience. Fast Paced: Kingsman 2 may run for 2.5 hours, but it certainly doesn't feel like it at all to me. With all the laughs, emotional investment, and action, you'll experience a time warp to the end of the film. I certainly did not feel bored in this movie at all, and was quite pleased by the entertainment it brought. To have that pace and the decent balance brought with it, is not something you see in most films. Action: Of course my favorite aspect has to be the action packed into the film on many levels. Kingsman 2 keeps up the high energy infused sequences that are about guns, melee, gadgets, and over the top stunts. Eggsy and the gang bring their skills back in high definition, special effects crazy goodness, with a fantastic play list to further amp things up. This dynamic was maintained through most of the movie, keeping things interesting with new gadgets to tear baddies a new one with. Despite a few missed moments, the action is certainly the selling point of this movie, especially with its integration into the plot and the pertinence to the mission. Throw in stable camera work and editing, and you just maximize the excitement of this film. DISLIKES: Ridiculousness: Don't get me wrong, the absurdity of this film is one of those charming qualities that got me into the movie. However, in this sequel, that level sometimes went a little too far outside reality to take away from the atmosphere they were creating. If the stunts aren't too far-fetched for you, then the invulnerability, or medical technology feats will have you rolling their eyes as they reach preposterous proportions. It fits in the comedic spoof theme, but feels out of place at times and took a little away from the suspense. This is only a small dislike. Viscous nature: I like a good action movie, and darkness can certainly open the gates to maximize the violence we love to see our actors perform. They unfortunately overstep their boundaries at times, crossing into the darker world I like to avoid if possible. Some rather gruesome deaths and blood bashings are the first scratches that chinked my armor. While a few are obviously computer generated, the special effects craft some rather scarring images that won't leave my memory anytime soon. Even worse though, is the cruelty to animals in this film. You know I hate unnecessary hurting of our furrier friends, but Kingsman was not hesitant to go the distance of getting emotional responses by this means. Not cool for me, but if you lack that empathy, you'll shrug it off like the agent's credo. Wasted Characters: Kingsman has a lot of great actors, with much of our cast reprising their roles in style and to great heights. Even newcomers like Julianne Moore as an eccentric villain, or Halle Berry as a tech geek, get applause from me. Hollywood though fails to live up to utilizing all their characters to the same degreeagain. Agents who survived the wraith of the last film are reduced to the background with little remorse, making small contributions at the best. New agent wise don't count on eye candy Channing Tatum to do much better, resorting to one action scene, and more modeling in an Abercrombie and Fitch manner. Why he doesn't get a serious chance? I can't answer, but I was disappointed with his involvement in the film. VERDICT:Overall, I was very pleased with this sequel and enjoyed the thrill of returning to the frontlines of the spy war. A compelling story with much emotion, amidst comedy and high speed action are the selling points to this film. Yet, the ridiculousness of the stunts, amidst the brutal kills shots and wasted characters takes away from the movie. Still, it's worth a trip to the theater and I encourage you to hit the theaters to experience the stunts in full glory and enjoy another fun action adventure. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Flash forward to 2017, when everyone has seen Kingsman by means of digital and physical media. Kingsman: The Golden Circle has more of the same action, humor, sex, and music that the original enjoyed so much. Despite being longer than the last one, this one saves the best for last.

77,Kingslaay,A poor man's James Bond and wannabe spy film,1,20 September 2017,"This was another terrible installment for Kingsman and adding a star studded cast did not help carry this mess of a film. Lets get to brass tax: this film and its predecessor does not hold a candle to the iconic Bond film series which has been deemed by many to be the greatest film series of all time. Bond has class, charm and in most cases a decent story to weave all together. Kingsman is a bad joke and an insult to 007 by people putting it in the same sentence. In many Bond films Daniel Craig, Sean Connery and Roger Moore did many of their stunts, they were real fights and action sequences. Kingsman is an absolute joke when it comes to stunts or even fight scenes, it is like watching a CGI cartoon as we know its utter BS. At least Austin Powers was funny and never hid from the fact that it was a parody and not to be taken seriously. Kingsman is so ridiculous that its not even funny but just a sad mess to watch. This film will be sure to impress amateur film goers or teenagers who don't know much about anything. But for anyone with half a brain and some taste will be able to see through the ridiculous drivel that is Kingsman.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

I was looking forward to Golden Circle & had been looking forward to a Kingsman sequel since the first film.But I have to admit I didn't find Golden Circle all that enjoyable, I mean it was funny, had some awesome action sequences along with some interesting characters (including the ones reprising their roles) but I felt this film didn't have that ""flavour"" or ""spark"" or even ""wit"" which is what the first Kingsman had! The American overtone kind of took over this film too much, which defeats the whole ""British Spy Film"" formula which made the first so great! I also felt this film dragged more than the first, even though the first film was only 12 minutes shorter, but I think it was mostly the pacing which had this kind of effect, maybe if it was faster & more rapid, then maybe. However, I did find Elton Johns Character funny in this, he plays himself. The sort of surprising return of Colin Firths character also was good. The action sequences too were also decent enjoy.But like with most sequels, the film just wasn't that good! Maybe a re-watch is in order...! But I felt the film dragged, the pacing was a bit slow & the American overtone was kind of dominating the film a bit. Overall, 6/10.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
80,bkrauser-81-311064,Kingsman the Golden Shower,3,19 September 2017,"F**k this movie! F**k this movie in the foppish, lewd, aggressively mean-spirited, blithely reductive, brazenly sexist, dizzyingly gross, egregiously slapdash, mordantly stupid a**hole. For the record, in case you want to abort this review early, I might as well tell you I wasn't sold on the first Kingsman (2014). But while that one had all the same faults as this one, it at least had the wherewithal to employ competent storytelling techniques like pacing, character arcs and thematic clarity. This one took all the problems of the first one and stuck them under a magnifying glass to see if it'll make decent people squirm. The results might have been considered tragic if I wasn't convinced the creators weren't doing it on purpose.In the sequel to the surprise hit of ""Anglo Knows Best,"" we revisit Eggsy (Egerton), Merlin (Strong) and the rest of the Kingsmen just before their organization is torn asunder by a mysterious foe. Employing the Doomsday protocol, Anglo Goes West, to team up with another spy organization and bring down a reclusive drug-lord (Moore) with plans of holding the whole world hostage. Will Eggsy and his new pals be able to put a stop to this new menace? And will the sudden reappearance of Harry (Firth), long thought to be dead, make or break the Kingsmen once and for all?Man-eating robot dogs, electric lassos, submarine taxis – all of this and more you can expect from The Golden Circle. Much like its predecessor, this movie has its heart and mind in the right place when it comes to absurd and remarkably bizarre gadgets. But that, along with a couple of James Bond inspired establishing shots are about the only things this movie has going for it. The rest is awash in missed opportunities, humdrum action and pallid plot points that are either too excessive to be fun or as forcefully lachrymose as holding a puppy hostage at gunpoint.It's a bad case of Kick-Ass 2 (2013) syndrome. Instead of approaching its infectious satire from a different angle or codifying its unique, candy-coated world with bold, trend-setting choices, the movie just opts for more. There's more explosions, more gunfights, more gore, more slap-happy goofiness, more moments of posh-looking kick-a**ery set to toe-tapping glam rock. All of it is trying to push the envelope, but none of it sticks.Part of it might have something to do with the film's lack of backbone. The first film, for better or worse, clung to Eggsy's quasi-coming-of-age story like a steaming helping of hatred to a Westboro Baptist Churchgoer. No matter how low the film went (and may I remind you it went pretty low), we could always rely on our affable underdog to be the upstanding gentleman he's meant to be while never resorting to anything more terrible than butt stuff.Here however there's nothing really to root for. Eggsy's personal life is treated like a trifle and his reunion with Harry his mentor has no real impetus. The only real moment of character vulnerability comes when he comes across a clumsily established moral dilemma that felt like it was cooked up by an apologetic for the skill of pickup artistry.Meanwhile to answer for the litany of criticism thrown in 2014, this flick doubles down on the extreme sexism. The perky princess butt- play from the first one (Alstrom) is now the nagging girlfriend, Agent Lancelot (Cookson) is a pile of cinders (oh, yeah spoiler alert), Poppy Delevingne is brought in just so we can look at the inside of a CGI vagina and Julianne Moore, our villain basically plays a devious version of the valium popping housewife whose stuck in the fifties. Then there's Halle Berry who plays the Merlin to the Kingsman's American counterparts – The Statesmen. She does very little other than state the obvious but is nevertheless given a chance to sit at the big-boy table in token appreciation because f**k. This. Movie. So. Hard.This movie is essentially an evil genie's answer to a wish for ""more"". It is big, loud, messy, revolting and almost entirely jeopardy-free. If you consider the first Kingsman to be a cathartic bender than this is the whisky soaked hangover that accompanies it. You want to know if it's proof; set it on fire.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
81,moviexclusive,"Even more over-the-top than its predecessor, this overlong and overstuffed 'Kingsman' sequel still offers plenty of fun but is also a lot more cartoonish and a lot less lively",6,21 September 2017,"As is typical for a sequel of this nature, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' succumbs to the tendency to do everything its predecessor did bigger, louder and wilder.That pretty much sums up the rollicking car chase scene which kicks off the movie, as our teenage protagonist Eggsy (Taron Edgerton) finds himself attacked by a former turncoat Kingsman agent Charlie (Edward Holcroft) whom he thought had perished. Besides their close- quarter skirmish in the back of a retrofitted London cab careening down the streets of London at night, Eggsy also finds himself shot at by heavily armed gunmen on three other vehicles, which he eventually takes out with a trio of miniature missiles in the middle of a park.Soon after, the entire Kingsman is nearly wiped out, save for Eggsy and his handy tech guru Merlin (Mark Strong), triggering the so- called 'doomsday' protocol that has both of them travelling to Kentucky to seek the help of their US counterpart called the Statesmen. There is now not one but two espionage organisations, and consequently a surfeit of secret agents joining the fold, including Statesmen head Champagne (Jeff Bridges), trigger-happy Tequila (Channing Tatum), tech nerd Ginger Ale (Halle Berry) and Burt Reynolds-style Western hero Whiskey (Pedro Pascal). Oh yes, the other audience favourite Harry Hart (Colin Firth) whom was shot point-blank in the head in the first movie is back too, courtesy of a McGuffin that inadvertently sucks any sense of real-life peril from the proceedings.But then again, the same can be said of the cartoonish villain this time round – a nefarious drug kingpin named Poppy (Julianne Moore) who lives in her '50s 'Happy Days' vision of Middle America, complete with movie house, hair salon and diner, right in the heart of a remote Cambodian jungle village she calls 'Poppy Land'. Using her global domination of the drug business, she threatens to kill millions of people infected by her poisoned 'weed' unless the US President (Bruce Greenwood) legalises drugs. The caricature doesn't stop there; she has two killer robot dogs to protect her as well as a kidnapped Elton John (no kidding!) for her own entertainment/ amusement. It's silly all right and even more kiddish than before, notwithstanding Poppy's penchant for turning her disloyal subjects into cheeseburger filling using a heavy-duty industrial meat-grinder.There is indeed a lot going on at the same time – on top of taking down Poppy and her henchman Charles, Eggsy has to contend with a somewhat off-form Harry who doesn't quite have the same aim, reflexes and worse, occasionally experiences fluttery butterfly hallucinations (before he chose military service, Harry had ambition to be a lepidopterist); a third-act turn also has Harry suspecting that Agent Whiskey has been working against them all along; and last but not least, a US President who has schemed to let millions of infected people, including his own Chief of Staff (Emily Watson), perish in order to fulfil his personal agenda of ending the war on drugs in one fell swoop. Yet even at close to two-and-a-half-hours, director Matthew Vaughn and his long-time screen writing collaborator Jane Goldman struggle to tie all the strands together compellingly, resulting therefore in a narrative that has a lot of ideas spinning around but not quite cohering fully with one another.That many characters and story lines also means less time for Eggsy or for that matter, Eggsy and Merlin as well as Eggsy and Harry, the sum of which arguably gave the first movie genuine poignancy alongside its madcap action. Without a similarly robust emotional anchor, Vaughn predictably ratchets up the scale and tempo of the big action set-pieces, although none quite matches the same breath-taking audacity as the piece de resistance from the previous movie (remember the church massacre?). There is a bar fight which sees Agent Whiskey teach some sneering local troublemakers a lesson with his electric lasso (which is intentionally reminiscent of an iconic sequence in the last movie when Harry was in much better shape), followed by a wild shootout at a deserted lodge high up in the snowy Italian mountainside (which is also intentionally reminiscent of the classic James Bond flick 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'), and finally the climactic showdown at Poppy Land that sees Eggsy and Harry (with Elton as an unlikely ally, no less) confront their arch nemesis and her array of gadgets. To be sure, Vaughn hasn't lost his imagination, verve or irreverence in the able blend of high-octane action and tongue-in-cheek humour, and these aggressively stylised sequences are undoubtedly the highlight of the film and worth the price of admission alone; but the generous use of blood and gore doesn't disguise the fact that the loss of danger diminishes the thrill and edge in the original.If therefore your intent is to enjoy more of the same stylistic pizazz which Vaughn brought to the breathless fight scenes, then 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' will surely satisfy – not only in its audacious defiance of the law of physics but also in its signature trick of making them sequences look like one single, long, unbroken shot. As with its predecessor, this sequel is firmly rooted in Vaughn's vision of the Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons' comic-book series as an over-the-top James Bond pastiche that cranks up the graphic violence while retaining the classic spy franchise's classy air of sophistication. To be sure, we never expected the sequel to feel as fresh and original as its predecessor, but by trying to do so, it inadvertently turns what made it unique into sheer overkill, further exacerbated by a bloated plot that feels busy yet laboured at the same time. It is still plenty of fun all right, but it is nowhere as exciting, lively or distinctive as its claim to fame.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

83,Screen_Blitz,"The movie scores for an engaging blend of stylized, hyperkinetic violence and subversive humor, even if it fails to reach the height of its predecessor",7,1 October 2017,"Agent 007 receives a stylized, over-the-top treatment once again in Matthew Vaughn's follow-up to the sleeper hit spy action comedy 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', a movie that swiped the classic spy genre and cranked it up with an audaciously shocking spin of edginess and gut-busting departure from realism. Like the predecessor, this film aims to be as irreverent and over-the-top as possible without hitting the breaks on absurdity. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the level of audacious appeal Vaughn hit with the first film perhaps doesn't quite reach the peak. A few calculated flaw are that is a little less funny and less effective on its subversiveness. But when it comes to delivering the sweet action thrill elan, it earns its badge. In this case, the positives significantly outweigh the negatives, and the movie holds a special place in its heart for the filmgoers who were ecstatic about the first film. Taron Edgerton reprises his role as Eggsy, who is now a rookie agent of Kingsman and is in relationship with his sexy Swedish sweetheart Princess Tilde (played by Hanna Alstrom). When the Kingsman headquarters are destroyed by missiles launched by the devious Poppy Adams (played by Julianne Moore), he and Merlin (played by Mark Strong) must collaborate with another spy organization The Statesman, headed by Ginger Ale (played by Halle Berry). There, they join forces with fellow agents including booze- drinking cowboy Tequila (played by Channing Tatum), lasso-wielding Whiskey (played by Pedro Pascal), and the operation leader Champagne (played by Jeff Bridges) on a mission to stop Poppy from smuggling a hazardous drug that is killing millions of Americans. Along the way, they are met with a mysterious encounter with Harry (played by Colin Firth) who miraclously survived the last film, and an exotically disguised Elton John (playing himself) held captive by Poppy.One can always count on Matthew Vaughn to delivering the excitement of gun-blazing and Pedro Pascal whipping his lasso in a frenetic ass-kicking frenzy. The absorbing energy of our character facing down the baddies has all made its return here, with just slightly less edgier side. If you happen to one of those who was alienated by Colin Firth slaughtering a congregation of baptist churchgoers in the last film, don't worry, you don't get anything like that here. However, the film does absorb into a wild, hyper-kinetic with two major action sequences: the opening car chase sequence and the the bombastic raid in the Poppyland village, both of which are complete with a spicy soundtrack to amp up the high-octane tone. These aspects manage to stand out among the flaws that hinder the narrative, particularly with the overabundance of subplots that slow the pacing around the halfway mark. When the story takes characters to Kentucky to unite with the Statesman, it opens doors to some witty moments of humor, which mainly focuses on poking at southern lifestyles. While some of the jokes work, others come off a bit ham- fisted. Some, however, will get a kick out of Channing Tatum yattering with a heavy southern accent. It's only too bad he doesn't share much screen time. On the bright side, the returning cast including Taron Edgerton, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth remain charismatic as ever. Julianne Moore, on the other hand, makes for a less than compelling villain, unlike Samuel L. Jackson who stole the show as dubious Valentine who held a plan that is about as diabolical as what Moore's Poppy Adams. Many can agree that Moore subjects for an odd choice as a darkly funny villain with a dubious streak of smuggling drugs and shoving people into a meat grinder to serve them as a hamburger. And what about Elton John? Well, he manages to crack a few laugh-worthy moments. Then there is Bruce Greenwood playing a fictional President of The United States, and let's just say he is portrayed in a way that will leave some with a cold-shoulder. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is fun-filled journey that, while not scaling the peak of its predecessor, scores for a solidly appealing blend of stylized over-the-topness and irreverent humor with a palpable sense of self-awareness. It is bold, it is violent, but most importantly, it is all made for fun for those willing to leave their intelligence at the door.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
84,Troy_Campbell,Healthy dose of kick-ass action and politically incorrect amusement.,7,24 September 2017,"Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service was a surprise smash hit in 2014. It was subversive, hilarious and chock full of super-stylish and ultra-violent action; no one saw it coming. This sequel delivers more of the same, which, element of surprise now absent, means it has lost some of its bite. The world is again being held hostage, this time by Julianne Moore's deranged drug kingpin, and Kingsman agents Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong) must join forces with their American counterparts at the Statesman agency. Featuring an adrenaline pumping car chase sequence through London, a clever bar-set fight showcasing the awesome lasso skills of Pedro Pascal's Whiskey, and a climactic all-out assault with as much slow-mo and speed-ramping as one could desire, the action-based thrills are certainly present. Yet nothing matches the sheer audacity and seared-in-your-brain memorability of the original's church bloodbath. And this is the movie in a nutshell: everything it does well, its predecessor did better. Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman litter shock and awe moments throughout—Eggsy 'infiltrating' a mark, Poppy's distinctive method of making burger patties—garnering the expected queasy laughs, but they aren't as wittily incisive as they could have been. Supplemented with Jeff Bridges as the head of Statesman, Pedro Pascal and Channing Tatum as his two star operatives, Halle Berry as their deskbound eyes and ears, and Colin Firth as the resurrected Harry Hart, our group of heroes led by Eggsy and Merlin are a fun bunch to hang out with. The same can't be said about the antagonists though. Moore's annoyingly bubbly villain is the cinematic personification of scratching a chalkboard, whilst henchman Charlie (Edward Holcroft) is a blend of total blandness and utter nothingness. Paling in comparison to the original and at almost 2.5 hours it's way too long, this follow-up nevertheless offers a healthy dose of kick-ass action and politically incorrect amusement.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
85,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Honours the first film just fine.,8,24 November 2017,"Kingsman has become a franchise that fills the void left open by the lack of spy films lately. It's a goofy James Bond pastiche that revels in its homage-making to ian Fleming's literary son. And Mark Millar and Matthew Vaughn clearly love James Bond almost as much as the Broccoli Family does; makes you wonder how they'd do making an ACTUAL Eon- canon Bond Movie. And Kingsman shows you don't need comic book movies to be just about men-in-tights-and-capes.The Golden Circle is just as visually memorable as the first movie, but its insanity goes WAY off the charts. It is a little more mean-spirited only at VERY select pets of the film but it still knows that it is an action-comedy making banter on not only James Bond style stories but modern politics as well (Bruce Greenwood plays an obvious Trump pastiche). The cast is fine, Colin Firth is back, Jeff Bridges joins the service and Pedro Pascal is a HEAVILY Texan-cowboy who is one of the best parts of the movie. It's like a less- nonsense Austin Powers interpretation of On Her Majesty's Secret Service at times; and I think it works very well in its self-aware humour and absurdity.Honestly I think it's better than what some of the critics are saying. It's not as good as the first I agree there, but it's not a conflicted movie in terms of style and direction. It's Matthew Vaughn just having the time of his life doing what he does best: being a zany and unique film director who clearly loves comic books as much as anybody at Comic-Con does.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
86,miguelneto-74936,"tries to be as striking as the first, but can not",6,31 December 2017,"Kingsman: The Secret Service was a creative and different film, unpredictable and full of great moments of action and with the Church scene that is phenomenal, since Kingsman: The Golden Circle succeeds in trying to follow the same way, first of all, the film will surprise you, according to which the film tries to make a scene as remarkable as the one of the church, but can not, the action scenes are good? Yes, but nothing will be marked and will be totally forgotten about 2 days later, another problem of the film is the characters, Eggsy in the first film worked very well, but this was due to the fact that Galahad carries a lot of him, in that he is a character who has a weak development, with weak phrases and with no great time, the character of Pedro Pascoal was what I liked the most in the film, because the best scenes of the film has involved him, and Mark Strong is very well too, the soundtrack is Matthew Vaugh unfortunately has many glitches, if he does well in the action, he sins in the development of the characters, in the end Kingsman even being fun, disappoints , because the expectation was high.

89,sharky_55,"""If you save the world, you know what that means.",5,28 September 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle makes you long for the poise and (dare I say) glee of the original Kingsman. It takes everything fast and exciting and horrifying from that film and splatters it onto an even messier canvas, only this time there's less sly spy homage and more potty mouths and high stakes. You may recall the Cinderella/My Fair Lady tale of poor Eggsy from 2014; born into government housing, rising from parkour and joyrides to become the top agent for the secret Kingsman service and learning a little manners along the way. Golden Circle all but concedes that the gag has run out of steam; there's only so many times you can punctuate a dramatic action sequence with a dash of bathos in a casual ""bruv"", and it hardly helps that Taron Egerton still looks as spiffing in a snapback as he does in a bespoke suit and spectacles. It is in fact up to the rest of the cast to maintain the stunning profanity per minute ratio until the dialogue becomes witless. Yes, it's funny that so-called gentlemen agents let out a curse word every now and then in shrill anger, less so when the script is just churning out an endless stream in the face of propriety. I was initially giddy at how Vaughn props up Elton John here as a bizarre addition to Poppy Adams' hall of retro attractions, forced to don feathered costumes and perform pained renditions of his greatest hits, interspersed with shrieks of &*!$%#@. I was even on board with 'Saturday' merging into the backing soundtrack for Harry and Eggsy's storming of the fort (I dare anyone to not start tapping their feet here, although overall it lacks the furious rhythm of 'Free Bird'). He looks to be having a lot more fun than Mark Hamill. Yet when every second line reverts to the same joke of 'he's been knighted by the Queen but look at him swearing his head off!', it gets a little old. Conveniences are usually abound for studio-ordered sequels but Golden Circle might put them all to shame. It's astounding that Egerton and Alström can even keep straight faces being all lovey-dovey with their relationship having been cobbled together from a two minute sexual gag from the last film; Moore may be positively batty and stuck in a cannibalistic 60s diner, but the most absurd scene of them all is the Danish princess celebrating Brandon's birthday on a shoddy couch with a bit of vodka. Suffice to say that no tears are shed when their relationship is put to the test mid- film, the princess signing off with a premature ejaculation snipe after objecting to what may be the laziest excuse for some sleazy spy hi-jinks. Sorry, but if you have nanobots that can reverse headshots, you also have tracking devices that don't have to be inserted via digital penetration. And say goodbye to any earned sentiment from Harry's sacrifice because he's back with a bang, and say goodbye to any further character depth that may have been hidden behind his mysterious backstory. Golden Circle has written itself into a corner. Now that Firth's past has been hollowed out, and now that the series' narrative backbone in Mark Strong's Merlin has been farewelled (the ever reliable guru of the Kingsman is always there to deliver exposition without straining too much, and add a dash of Scottish humour and gentlemanly gravitas), where do they even go from here? It seems weird to criticise a franchise for having so little foresight in a day and age where sequels and IP regenerations over-stuff the box office, but in this case it just further highlights how desperate they are for another hit. Bring Firth back anyway you can, yelled a studio head. Make him a ghost, or perhaps he had an evil twin (yes, these are actual ideas tossed up for the film). Moore is drawn along the same lines as Jackson's Bieberlicious, Maccas-loving supervillain, riffing off the same sort of persona that builds menace through little smiles and uncomfortable moments. Instead of saving the environment she just wants to rule the world as her drug kingdom, and her large scale plot involves blackmailing the president to legalise all her produce and end the war on drugs once and for all. But Kingsman films don't really do politics; they flirt a little with scenarios but lack the gall to really go there. The US government stacking up cages of infected victims in a football stadium has just the right amount of zany to make you laugh and then pause, but that's about as far as this satire will go. In any case, the whole thing looks ugly. The original at least had a little fun with its action sequences, while every moment here is smothered in an almost deafening soundtrack comprised mainly of the thudding brass theme. The fights are underlined and stuffed full of speed-ramped action shots that seemed to have been envisioned first, and then built around. The camera fetishises all the shiny metal and machinery of Poppy's fabrication, but you miss the hard-hitting satisfaction of genuine blows. And every reaction shot is captured with potent zoom lenses, all but erasing any background details along with the blurry compositing. You almost long for when this series was just about crude bar brawls.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
90,rockman182,Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017),7,28 September 2017,"I might as well come out and say I wasn't a fan of the first. Parts of it were good but I wasn't really a fan of the overabundance of stylistic action scenes and characters that I didn't care for. Wasn't looking forward to the second one but decided to see if Matthew Vaughn was going to be able to turn this film series around for me. I'm not overly fond of Vaughn's work though I did dig X-Men: First Class. With The Golden Circle, I think this film is definitely better than the first but still not that sold on Kingsman.In this film the world is under attack from a new threat. A rather great Julianne Moore plays Poppy Adams, who laces the drugs of the world with a toxin causing mass chaos among millions of people. Eggsy of the Kingsman reunites with Harry and the Kingsman work with a secret service from the South named the Statesman. This film makes use of a few A- listers. We've got Hally Berry, Channing Tatum, and Jeff Bridges added to the cast.The film ups the over the top ridiculous gadgets and improbable action scenes. It may be fun for some but I think it just feels really unrealistic and gimmicky. I get that the characters are sharply dressed, drink and present themselves like impeccably dressed agents. Its overbearing though. We kind of get it. The film is overlong, I don't think I felt the length however I think it becomes clear that the film runs out of steam 3/4 of the way through. Some of the action scenes are headache inducing and really desperately trying to be cutting edge.I still think the film is overall better than the first. Julianne Moore is actually great as a nice talking, homely, yet violent villain. I didn't mind Pedro Pascal and some of the other familiar faces added. I hated the inclusion and predominant use of Elton John. It wasn't funny and was just randomly weird. I know this film will please fans of the first film but its still not a great selling point as to why this franchise should be considered great. It has a few cool moments (Mark Strong and the rendition of Take Me Home, Country Roads is fantastic), but overall I found it to be as a better but still forgettable entry into the series.6.5/10",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Elton John as himself in feathered Captain Fantastic wardrobe goes Bruce Lee flying kick on the bad guy. Taron Egerton's Agent Eggsy places high tech sensor in the cavity of groupie Clara, played by hippie spacey Poppy Delevingne, not the one in her mouth. ""Kingsman 2"" culminates in the exquisite over-the-top martial arts and gun display with Eggsy and his mentor Harry, played by Colin Firth, at drug cartel headquarters Poppyland in the jungles of Cambodia to the tune of Elton's ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting"".

Eggsy tells Harry that he fears if they can't retrieve the villain's antivirus, his fiancée Princess Tilde, lovely Hanna Alstrom, will die. Eggsy regrets that he fell in love with her; thus, violating Kingsman oath. Harry says, ""Having something to lose makes life worth living."" Firth can truly land a line. In ""The King's Speech"" when he says, ""I have a voice."" he broke my heart. ""The King's Speech"" is one of best movies ever made. Clearly, ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is not in that company. Contrary to critical mass opinion, ""Kingsman 2"" is just plain fun. I believe that counts for something. Writer and Director Matthew Vaughn returns in his sequel of the very entertaining ""Kingsman"" with scattered cluster of narratives, mostly outrageous and hilarious. Julliane Moore does her whacked out best as global drug lord Poppy, who single handedly annihilates the Kingsman. All that apparently remains is Eggsy and his beloved tech adviser Merlin, played by stalwart Mark Strong. Poppy as part of her master plan created a virus that will kill anyone, who uses any of Poppyland's recreational illicit drugs or associated derivatives. This targets millions of people. This is all part of Poppy's scheme to extort the United States. Comical Bruce Greenwood in this satirical incarnation of the President of the United States sees this as the leverage point to ""End the War on Drugs"". Without either suppliers or addicts, there is no war. This stark simplicity is part of the warped sense of humor in Vaughn and Jane Goldman's screenplay. Forced to regroup Eggsy and Merlin follow their intelligence trail to the American version of Kingsman in Kentucky—Statesman. Channing Tatum is very cool as Agent Tequila, who provides their introduction, and mercilessly kicks both their asses with his martial arts skills. Too bad Tatum is not leveraged more here. Perhaps, in ""Kingsman 3""? Statesman Leader Champ, played by laid back Jeff Bridges, and adviser Ginger, subtly brilliant Halle Berry, reveal to Eggsy and Merlin that Harry is alive, thought shot to death in ""Kingsman"". However, death in movies is as we all know: relative. Harry is alive without memory of his Kingsman past. There are great action sequences like where Agent Whiskey, charismatic Pedro Pascal, kills the army of winter soldiers with six shooters and a laser lasso. When the noise quiets, ""Kingsman 2"" meditates its center in the unexpected homage of Eggsy's mentors: Harry and Merlin. In the most touching scene Harry tells Merlin, ""It has been an honor"" Both Harry and Merlin are the Fathers that Eggsy never had, and they defined the man he becomes. ""Kingsman 2"" is bittersweet and nice in this acknowledgment. Besides as my friend Ron pointed out, the f bomb spewing Elton John in the movie actually might not be caricature. Yeah, there is a lot of weird going on in ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"". Most of it works, because of talented actors, a sense of humor, and some heart.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
92,phanthinga,Suffer the same fate as other movie sequels,8,22 September 2017,"Kingsman:The Golden Circle is a fun spy action movie.I enjoy the movie from start to finish.The cinematography is well done,the action scene is big and loud with the return of many likable characters while introduce new ones but as a sequel it absolutely add nothing to the series.The new villain Poppy played by Julianne Moore not as memorable as Sam.L.Jackson in the first one.The action scene like i said earlier is big and loud but none of them leave a big impact on me like the previous church scene.Biggest surprise is Elton John as himself and i swear he stole the whole movie for me with just a little screen time",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
93,RforFilm,"Kingsmen The Golden Circle may have increased the over-the-top tone, but that's what I expect out of this series",8,26 September 2017,"Director Matthew Vaughn could have stayed on the X-Men franchise to continue the building of his vision of the Marvel favorite, but instead left to take on Kingsmen: The Secret Service. This was something of a gamble, as the comic series was not that well known and the previews seems to show the movie as another spy knock off. This only lowered expectations as it became a surprise hit, thanks to it's throwback-style of 1960's spy movies and it's over-the-top nature gave the genre a fresh breath of air. Given how dark and grisly spy movies had become with The Bourne series and 007 going in that direction, it was nice to see Kingsmen: The Secret Service as something more light hearted. As soon as I left the theater, I felt that the series would continue with more crazy stories to tell about the finely dressed spies and how they go after villains. Kingsmen went from something few were interested in into something people were excited to see. I became even more ecstatic when I found out that the story was going show what the ""American Kingsmen"" were going to be like. So lets see if Kingsmen: The Golden Circle is just as entertaining as the first. In the time that has passed, Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton) has embraced his part of the Kingsmen, taking the title of ""Galahad"" in honor of his late mentor. He's also in a relationship with the princess of Sweden Tilde (played by Hanna Aiström). The film opens with Eggsy fighting a former Kingsmen candidate Charlie, now turned villain. Though Eggsy manages to escape, Charlie's bionic arm hacks into the Kingsmen computers, revealing all the data to an unknown source. While Eggsy is having dinner with the royal Swedish family, a collection of missiles destroys the Kingsmen headquarters, the remaining agents, and even Eggsy's home.With only tech guru Merlin (played by Mark Strong) the only survivor, he and Eggsy follow protocol and are lead to a whiskey facility in Tennessee, which is home to Statesmen, an American spy organization. Upon meeting their leader Champagne (played by Jeff Bridges), he's saddled along with agent Whiskey (played by Pedro Pascal) to investigate a worldwide drug poisoning that may be connected with the attacks on Kingsmen. This drug organization, run by Poppy Adams (played by Julianne Moore), is the Golden Circle and is responsible for a large amount of drugs that are dealt with. As Eggsy is investigating, he also comes to discover that his mentor Harry Hart (played by Colin Firth) is not dead.It seems that Matthew Vaughn did his best to keep the same tone from the previous movie, only to step it up. The Kingsmen: The Golden Circle is definitely over-the-top, violent, and comical. Does that it make it better then the first one? No, as some of it can get a little too ridiculous (there's a cannibal sequence that made half of my theater laugh and the other half squeamish in horror) and though the last movie was a respectable two hours, this was simply overlong.I can say that as an action movie, this did satisfy me as there were some fantastically staged moments, especially the finale that takes place at the villains layer (which is modeled out of a 1950's Americana town). Other sequences including car chases in London and a mountain scene in Italy shows that Matthew Vaughn still has some unique ideas. What he needed was a more polished script as if in order to extend the story, there are moments that only seem tacked on in to make the plot ten minutes longer.Though guys like Colin Firth and Jeff Bridges had their fun moments, the winners here are Taren Egerton, Julianne Moore, and another celebrity guest that I won't spoil here. Julianne Moore is clearly having a lot of fun being the stereotypical spy villain, with a more motherly nature that does give her an unnerving edge, even if it's not as memorable as Samuel L. Jackson's performance from the first movie. Seeing Taren Egerton having gone from street punk to gentlemen-like has been a fascinating trip, only exemplifying what a good actor their young man is.I'll give this eight laser lassos out of ten. Though some might see it as overkill, I found Kingsmen: The Golden Circle to be just as entertaining as the original. It might have matched it had the movies' runtime been cut by fifteen minutes. Just understand that if you feel like that the sequel is over-the-top, go and watch the first movie to remind yourself that it's always been that way.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
94,carbuff,Stops this franchise in its tracks.,1,25 November 2018,"The original ""Kingsman"" movie wasn't brilliant, but it was watchable with some originality; however, this sequel is nothing more than a blatant rip-off of bits from various older espionage action films (in particular, stuff from ""James Bond"", ""Jason Bourne"", ""Mission Impossible"", and similar movies). At least Frankenstein's monster lived for a little while. This film, on the other hand, only lies lifeless on the operating table, not so much as even twitching. It has a couple of gratuitously violent scenes and a ton of swearing, both obviously intended to distract you from the fact that the plot is see-through flimsy and make the movie seem ""hip"". If you're a fan of Donald Trump, you're not going to be happy with this film. The U.S. president is an obvious stand-in for Trump, except that he's even more venal and intellectually shallow (assuming that's somehow possible). The purpose of this film is clearly to bank more coin off of the unexpected success of the first film, and likely set the stage for a future profitable franchise. Please, let's kill this baby before it starts to crawl. This film is utterly and completely directionless and pointless. I had a friend over for night of dinner and movies, hoping that this flick would at least be halfway decent entertainment, but, unfortunately, it only leaves you longing for the two plus hours of your life you actually feel was criminally stolen from you. At least I'm a good cook.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
95,bankofmarquis,"The Brits are goods, the Americans bring the film down",7,23 September 2017,"I was a fan of the first KINGSMAN film back in 2014.  This stylized, violent, charming and daffy film took my completely by surprise and I LOVED the world that was built, the characters that were introduced and the STYLIZED VIOLENCE that was set forth and I couldn't wait to see what comes next.And...what comes next was more of the same, but without the shock and awe of the uniqueness of things and, quite frankly, I was feeling somewhat disappointed...And then an ""old friend"" from the first film shows up and the film recaptures the magic of the first for the 2nd half of this movie and, by the end, I had a ball.KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLE follows the exploits of the hero from the first film Eggsy (a ""good enough"" Taron Egerton).  When a disaster takes out most of the Kingsmen, it is up to him and gadget wiz Merlin (Mark Strong - more on him later) to find out who targeted the Kingsmen and take them down.  To do this, they must join forces with their compatriots in the United States - THE STATESMEN.And...this is where this movie bogs down.  While the Statesmen should have been interesting and quirky (like the Kingsmen), they instead are boring stereotypes.  Channing Tatum is bland as main STATESMAN Tequila, while Halle Berry is wasted as the Statesman's counterpart to Merlin - Ginger Ale - and don't even get me started on how Jeff Bridges seems to be sleepwalking through his part as the head of the Statesman.  It is only when a long presumed dead character from the first film shows up does this film pick up steam and start to approach the energy, enthusiasm and audacity of the first film.It's not a spoiler to say that this character is Collin Firth's agent Galahad (they do a nice job of bringing him back from the dead) and when the story focuses back on Egerton, Firth and Strong joining back up to fight the villain (a deliciously evil Julianne Moore), the fun returns and stylistic violence gets turned up a notch and becomes quite stylistic and quite...ahem...violent.So why is this?  I think it is because the filmmakers are British, so they have a good handle on how to subtly poke fun at the James Bond SuperSpy character-types and their only exposure to an American Hero is John Wayne or Clint Eastwood so they poorly try to spoof American stereotypes and they fail badly.Only Pedro Pascal (TV's GAME OF THRONES and NARCOS) fairs well as one of the U.S. Agents (and he's Chilean!) showing more than one dimension whilst the others do not.Thankfully, the 2nd half of the film focuses on the 3 British Agents/stars and that is where the film really takes off.  Mark Strong, in particular, really comes into his own as Merlin and becomes the heart and soul of this film.  As a matter of fact, I'd be fine with them killing of Egerton's character and just give us a movie with Firth and Strong, but, alas, that's not going to happen.One last note.  There is a very British, very popular, very aging member of ROCK MUSIC ROYALTY that makes an extended cameo in this film (maybe even a supporting part) and this person understood the type of film they were in and went along with the fun with a wink in their eye and a skip in their step.  It was fabulous, darling, a highlight of the film.As were all things British, too bad the Americans were around to bring the fun down.Letter Grade:  B+7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
96,Anurag-Shetty,Falls slightly short of its predecessor.,9,28 September 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle continues with the adventures of the spy organization, known as Kingsman. When the Kingsman headquarters are blown up, the Kingsman join forces with their American counterpart, the Statesman. Together, the Kingsman & the Statesman have to join forces, to stop an imminent threat to the world. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is an awesome film. Director Matthew Vaughn has made sure to keep all the elements, that made Kingsman: The Secret Service(2014) a massive success. The action set pieces are mind-blowing. All the action scenes have been taken several notches higher, compared to the original. My favorites are the cable car scene & the climax. The visual effects are superb. However, this movie is not as hilarious as the first. Don't get me wrong. There are a number of scenes that make you cackle. It's just that, the humor was more fresh in the previous film. If I had to choose, I'd say Kingsman: The Secret Service(2014) is a bit superior to Kingsman: The Golden Circle. Taron Egerton is spectacular as Eggsy. Colin Firth is brilliant as Harry Hart. Mark Strong is excellent as Merlin. Julianne Moore is outstanding as Poppy. Pedro Pascal is fantastic as Whiskey. Halle Berry is great as Ginger. Edward Holcroft is impressive as Charlie. Hanna Alstrom is good as Princess Tilde. Elton John is hysterical as Elton John. Poppy Delevingne is effective as Clara. Michael Gambon, Sophie Cookson, Bruce Greenwood & Emily Watson are perfect as Arthur, Roxy, President of the United States & Chief of Staff Fox, respectively.

99,dave-mcclain,even more fun than the first one,8,22 September 2017,"They're the same, but different. Once upon a time, one of them was like a proud and dignified parent and the other, a stubborn and rebellious child. After that child left home and matured, the child became stronger than the parent, to the point that the child protected the parent when the parent was being attacked by dangerous enemies. But the most important characteristics of what is often called their ""special relationship"" are their common heritage, their mutual affection and their cooperation in good times and bad. In fact, this parent had several other children and has many more cousins and neighbors, but none so closely aligned and so highly regarded by others. So, in spite of the strong disagreements that arose between them and warring against each other more than once, but because of their common language, culture and military, political and economic interests, and having fought common enemies on multiple occasions, it makes sense that freelance spy agencies from the United Kingdom and the United States would work together in the action- adventure-comedy ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (R, 2:21). In fact, much like the countries that the story's different spy agencies represent, 2015's ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" and 2017's ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" are the same, but different. They're both based on the British spy action-comedy comic book series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons (debuting in 2012, originally called ""The Secret Service"", but renamed ""Kingsman"" when the movies started coming out). Both films focus on the character Eggsy (Taron Egerton), the young thug who became a gentleman spy and works for the highly secretive British spy agency known as ""Kingsman"", headquartered in a nice but unremarkable tailor shop. Key characters in both also include the Kingsman IT specialist known as Merlin (Mark Strong) and an experienced agent (and mentor to Eggsy) who is called Galahad (Oscar winner Colin Firth) even though he was apparently killed in the first film. Both also co-star a cultural icon: ""Star Wars"" legend Mark Hammill in the first, music legend Elton John in the second. Maybe most importantly, both films were co-written by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn and directed by Vaughn.A year after the events of the first film, Eggsy is doing what Eggsy does – romancing the girl, hanging out with his friends, fighting off bad guys and standing ready to save the world, if so needed. As he's leaving work one evening, he's attacked by Charlie (Edward Holcroft), a former Kingsman recruit gone wrong, whom Eggsy almost killed in the first film. But this attack isn't just about revenge. Charlie is a man on a mission – a mission to entirely eliminate the Kingsman organization – and he nearly succeeds. While at dinner with the King and Queen of Sweden (the late Björn Granath, in his final film role, and Samantha Womack), the parents of his girlfriend, Princess Tilde (Hanna Alström), Eggsy learns that Kingsman locations around the U.K. have been attacked. He seems to be the only surviving agent and Merlin, the only surviving staff member. Together, they pursue the Kingsman ""Doomsday Protocol"" which seems to be about drinking an old bottle of whiskey from the Stateman distillery near Louisville, Kentucky, USA. Eggsy and Merlin head to the states where they discover that, like their tailor shop, the distillery is a front for a super-secret spy organization. The good ol' boy American version is headed by a man named Champagne (Oscar winner Jeff Bridges), who wants to be called ""Champ"". His agents include Tequila (Channing Tatum), Whiskey (Pedro Pascal) and their IT specialist, Ginger Ale (Oscar winner Halle Berry). Champ puts all Statesman resources at the disposal of Kingsman and both groups work together against the sweet but ruthless international drug kingpin (and leader of this film's titular organization) Poppy Adams (Oscar winner Julianne Moore). Poppy has built a 1950s-inspired lair out of ancient ruins deep in the jungles of Cambodia – and she has kidnapped Elton John to be her personal entertainer! She's the kind of person who will have one of her new thugs throw one who broke her rules into a large meat grinder and then make the new guy a hamburger out of the remains. She's the Happy Homemaker meets Scarface. And, like Richmond Valentine before her, Poppy is pursuing an agenda that could lead to the deaths of many millions of people around the world. Defeating her evil plans will take every bit of toughness, skill and bravery from the Statesman and Kingsman organizations – including that of Harry Hart, who is now living at Statesman headquarters, but isn't the Galahad whom Eggsy and Merlin knew.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" has all of the action, attitude and appeal of the first one, but improves on its own formula. The gadgets and the fight sequences are as delightfully over-the-top as the original, but the violence is (appropriately) just a shade less gleeful (no heads exploding into fireworks set to music). And, even though there's still a strong us-against-the-world vibe, this script is a little less mean-spirited and doesn't try to make every single person and group outside of Kingsman (and Statesman) into evil caricatures. This sequel may still be a bit excessive in certain areas for some Movie Fans, but it has an even better cast (including Sir Elton in action sequences!), even better direction (including some great set pieces) and is more fun than the first one.

The original movie had much more scope as we saw Eggsy being trained up to be a spy. The first movie was an unexpected gem, but it had little expectation beforehand. The success of that movie means expectations were high for the second movie. Whilst it is never quite as engaging as the first movie there's still plenty of entertainment in the second movie. This sees a collaboration between the British Kingsman team up with the US Statesman. Rather than borrowing some of the plot lines from Bond it almost seems some of the plot has come from the real life spy organisations. The movie skips along at a great pace and it's certainly well worth a watch. The one gripe I did have was that there was too much Elton John.

Following the emergency protocol, Eggsy is about to encounter a couple of surprises which might be the key to saving the world once again.It's a movie which follows the path taken by its predecessor, in terms of style, characters and story. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much to improve upon it. We get to see about the same thing but with a different antagonist and one or two twists. Except these it's about the same movie. I'm not saying that it is a bad thing, but I was left lusting for a bit more. It's characters are diverse and likeable, also well played by their actors, but the story is a bit inferior. It's much more predictable than it can be considered ignorable, thus the drama involved is even more lessened, compared to its predecessor, of course.But, fortunately for me, the action sequences are still as impressive and intense. Although even more exaggerated, they still play an important role in the viewer's entertainment. The gadgets used are also great, the CGI involved is top notch, thus providing a great time.Although a bit more serious than its predecessor, this sequel doesn't manage to stay on par with its predecessor. Its much more predictable story isn't able to provide as much drama or even thrill as it should, while not managing to do anything to improve and thus raise its bar to another level. It's still a pretty good movie, a good watch especially if you've seen The Secret Service, but one that could have been a lot better.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

The sexual nature of one scene (even though you don't actually see anything) is quite disgusting. The film seems to be up its own bottom with mindless special effects and literally no humour what so ever, actually I'm wrong, there was one scene after the cable car which was funny but the rest was just wrong.

105,bob-the-movie-man,Vaughn and Goldman cross the pond for more of the same.,7,8 October 2017,"You would probably need to be living under a rock not to know that ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is the follow-up film to Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman's highly successful 2015 offering ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"": a raucous, violent and rude entry into the spy-caper genre. And the sequel is more of the same: why mess with a crowd- pleasing formula?The fledgling agent Eggsy (Taron Egerton (""Eddie the Eagle""), curiously called ""Eggy"" at various points in the film for reasons I didn't understand) is now the new ""Galahad"" following the demise in the first film of the original, played by Colin Firth (""Magic in the Moonlight"", ""Bridget Jones' Baby""). But just as he's getting into his stride the whole Kingsman organisation, now headed by Michael Gambon (""Harry Potter"") as Arthur , is ripped apart by an evil drugs cartel called ""The Golden Circle"" headed by smiling but deadly Poppy (Juliane Moore, ""Still Alice"").Eggsy and Lancelot (Mark Strong, ""Miss Sloane"") in desperation turn to Statesman – the US equivalent organisation – and together with some surprising allies set out to defeat the evil plot to poison all casual drug users.Subtle this film certainly is not, featuring brash and absurdly unrealistic action scenes that are 90% CGI but – for me at least – enormous fun to watch. As with the first film (and I'm thinking of the grotesquely violent church scene here) the action moves however from 'edgy' to over-the-top/offensive at times. The 'burger scene' and (particularly) the 'Glastonbury incident' are the standout moments for all the wrong reasons. You can only hope a stunt vagina was used for this scene, else Poppy Delavigne (older sister of Cara) is going to find it very hard to find credible future work. One can only guess what tasteful interlude is being planned for Kingsman 3 – – a prostate- based tracker perhaps?The film works best when the core team of Taron Egerton, Mark Strong and Colin Firth (yes, Colin Firth!) are together. Jeff Bridges (""Hell or High Water""), Channing Tatum (""Foxcatcher"") and Halle Berry (""Monster's Ball"") all turn up as key members of 'Statesman' – adding star power but not a lot else – together with Pedro Pascal (""The Great Wall"") as 'Whiskey', who I expected to be someone equally famous behind the moustache but wasn't!There's also a very entertaining cameo from a star (no spoilers from me) whose foul-mouthed tirades I found very funny, and who also has the funniest line in the film (playing off one of the most controversial elements of the first film). It's fair to say though that others I've spoken to didn't think this appearance fitted the film at all. Julianne Moore makes for an entertaining – if less than credible – villain, as does Bruce Greenwood (""Star Trek: Into Darkness"") as a barely disguised Trump. None of the motivations of the bad 'uns however support any scrutiny whatsoever: this is very much a ""park your brain at the door"" film.I really shouldn't enjoy this crass, brash, brainless movie fast-food and I know many have hated it! But my guilty secret is that I really did like it – one of the best nights of unadulterated escapist fun I've had since ""Baby Driver"".

Being a huge fan of the first film with how smart, funny, and entertaining it was, I had high hopes for this sequel, while knowing very well that it probably wasn't going to top it. That being said, this is a worthy successor in my opinion, and I feel as though it can be enjoyed in the same ways that the first was. Sure, the originality of it is thrown out the window, due to the fact that it shares very similar plot points, but if you care about the characters and are able to have fun, it really can't be all that bad. Even though it has many issues, here is why I believe Kingsman: The Golden Circle isn't getting enough credit. Pursued by an evil organization in The Golden Circle, the Kingsman are under attack and all of their bases have been destroyed. With nothing left to do but seek help, the remaining remnants of the once booming organization set out on their own. Eggsy and Merlin being the last two members, come across a group called the Statesman, who wants nothing more than to recruit them as one of their own and bring down this new and looming threat. While many of the elements of the original film are being rehashed here, it's all about being fun and having likable characters, and I feel as though this sequel continues that in spades. Although there are many enjoyably fun aspects to this film, it's far from perfect, and that's where villain in Poppy comes into play. Her character, along with this new organization seemed very annoying to me. Their presence definitely moves the film forward in terms of story, but the idea of them and their overall execution felt very over-the-top and forced, even for a film like this. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a film that suffers from having too many likable protagonists and not anyone remotely intriguing as a villain. This made for a fun experience when the main characters were on screen, but there didn't seem to be any stakes. Going back to my original statement in saying that this film is very similar to the predecessor in terms of entertainment, that's easily the biggest takeaway I received from this instalment. Without giving too much away for those who have been completely oblivious to the promotional material for this movie, I have to say that the way certain characters are brought back into the forefront and how others ave their swam song was very satisfying in my opinion. Aaron Egerton remains a stellar performer in every role he's in, and this film is no exception. Although inconsistent at times, this sequel is still a blast to watch. In the end, the over-the-top style isn't for everyone, and if you didn't enjoy the first film, then I would have to recommend staying far away from this film, due to the fact that it's more of the same, just cranked up to eleven. Kingsman: The Golden Circle suffers from a poor villain story line, but the addition of new characters showcasing some pretty terrific action sequences definitely make up for that aspect. This sequel won't be remembered as the superior film, nor will it be remembered as one of the best sequels out there, but when it comes to satisfying fans of a surprisingly fun first film, I feel as though this one does it's job nicely. It takes it to a few extremes that I didn't really appreciate, but overall, this is a solid time at the movies.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
109,kuarinofu,What happened?,6,11 January 2018,"The first installment was over the top secret service action flick fun. It often balanced really close to being too much to take but it was actually spending time characters and story. It had a perfect flow, building up to a final climax which felt ridiculous but fun and entertaining, perfect pacing right there. 
This movie lost me with lightning speed. After the introduction of the main villain I was completely indifferent to what was happening. I'm 100% sure, this was written by a couple of 10 y.o. boys. 
And it just sort of kept going, wasting good acting talent one after another, slicing in cringe humour and some WTF moments. I don't want to spoil anything, but the tracer device installment scene was too much.
Seems like everyone on set was having fun with this movie but I wasn't. Maybe I wasn't too open minded to just relax and enjoy, or maybe this was just complete nonsense with some cool action scenes and a couple of good laugh lines.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
110,Carycomic,A worthy sequel...almost.,9,24 September 2017,"First off? I initially had doubts about going to see this sequel. From the previews I've been seeing all summer (and the second half of the movie title), I greatly feared that the enemy organization would be loosely based on an actual group of conspirators that existed during the American Civil War. A sort of cross between the Freemasons and the KKK!Which is why I initially thought to myself: ""Oh, great! The hate- mongering church-goers killed off in the first movie were just a front group for more powerful and higher tech xenophobes."" A suspicion that Halley Berry (as Agent Ginger Ale) seemed to confirm when her anecdote to Merlin seemed to indicate racism and sexism on Agent Whiskey's part.But, I'm happy to admit that I was wrong (for the most part).I love that they started the movie with an almost literal bang. Discourtesy of traitorous Kingsman trainee-turned-cyborg mercenary Charlie Hesketh! I also love that the studio brought back Colin Firth as Harry Hart, the previous Agent Galahad, in such a plausible-for-spy-fi way.It's too bad, however, that they had to kill off Agent Lancelot so early. I would love to have seen her ""interact' with Agent Tequila a lot more successfully than Eggsy and Merlin did. Watching overly macho rednecks get their keesters handed to them, by the so-called ""weaker"" sex, is one of my favorite movie stereotypes! But, it's almost just as good discovering that Channing Tatum's character evidently gives new meaning to the phrase "" whiskey and coke."" Thereby providing an excellent in- story reason for his replacement by Pedro Pascal's character.The culture clash between these representatives of two vastly different organizations is equally predictable. But, I suspect the writers did it that way on purpose, so as to play up the fact that Kingsmen and Statesmen have more similarities than differences!And, of course, I love the happy ending between Eggsy and Princess Tilde.The only reason I don't give this movie a perfect ten was the graphic way that Poppy had Angel kill his best friend. Thinly-disguised tirade against non-vegetarians, perhaps? Well, news flash! We carnivores are just vegetarians once-removed, and we're here to stay.So there. :P",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

112,brankovranjkovic,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle, action spy adventure sequel to 'The Secret Service'",6,27 September 2017,"This is the action spy adventure sequel to 'The Secret Service'.There are plenty of over the top action sequences, but the plot is poorly conceived. More time on developing the plot would have been well invested. The Kingsman headquarters is targeted and destroyed and most of the Kingsman members are simultaneously targeted and killed off, except Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong). This film then introduces the USA counterparts 'The Statesmen'. The disaster takes them to the USA where they need to team up to defeat the villain. The villain (Julianne Moore), saturates every popular drug with a slowly acting deadly virus. Our hero's mission is to retrieve a sample of the antidote. The best parts are the cameos from Elton John, in flamboyant costumes. These were truly brilliant. Having enjoyed the first Kingsman, I wanting to like this, but this is not as fresh as the launch film, sequels are rarely as good. I ended up feeling disappointed.

113,anselmdaniel,Derivative and bland,6,5 September 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the sequel to Kingsman: The Secret Service. The movie follows Taron Egerton as Egsy whom is now a Kingsman agent. The Golden Circle has destroyed the Kingsman and now seeks to dominate the world. The Kingsman must make contact with the Statesman and thwart The Golden Circle.Kingsman: The Golden Circle attempts to do a lot in its run-time. The movie tells the story of the destruction of the Kingsman, Egsy's relationship with the Swedish princess, the rise of the Golden Circle, the discovery of the Statesman, and the recovery of Harry's memories. The movie does all of this and perhaps does too much. All of these plots detract from the others and do not relate to each other in meaningful ways. Egsy's relation with the princess is constantly being brought up as his motivation but the movie does not make the audience care at all in the movie. This is not the only bloat in the movie. The President of the United States talking with Poppy is also superfluous. The scenes were funny but it had detracted from the stories the audience actually cared about.The Statesman are a more ridiculous form of the Kingsman. The only reason they were introduced was because the Kingsman were wiped out and to bring back Harry after his apparent death in the first movie. This felt like a missed opportunity as the Kingsman characters were likable. There were plenty of characters that could have been introduced but the movie decided to go for an American story. The Statesmen felt like a missed opportunity as none of them felt memorable. Tequila, played by Channing Tatum, is not in any notable scenes. The setting in the United States is interesting but it is primarily used to have action set pieces.The action in this movie is great. The action set pieces are creative and fun. The actors and action scenes are the best components of this movie as all the actors and actresses seem to be having a lot of fun in this movie.Kingsman: The Golden Circle is fun but is overly bloated. I enjoyed the movie but other action movies are recommended over this movie.Grade: C",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

So before you watch Elton John kick the crap out of someone while wearing a feather tuxedo, decide if a good but not great sequel is what you want to see.

116,0w0,Good story but very little action and very unrealistic...,6,15 August 2020,"I hate it when a movie is unrealistic ie. characters act unrealistically by letting a bad-guy get away on purpose or when they shoot 50+ bullets out of a standard pistol, for example... and unfortunately, there are many scenes in this movie where characters act unrealistically AND lots of unrealistic things happen like 2000+ bullets being shot at Eggsy yet not a single one hitting him.Apart from the constant unrealisticness, the MAJORITY of the movie is spent talking about and showing nonsense that doesn't progress the story/plot at all. This ends up making the movie much more boring than the previous film.Overall, you could probably give this movie a watch if you've got nothing better to watch, but it's certainly not one of those movies that you can watch 4 or 5 times before getting bored like you could do with the previous Kingsman film... 6/10, let's just hope that the 3rd installment will be better",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
117,MrDHWong,A solid follow-up to the 2015 film,8,21 September 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the sequel to the 2015 film Kingsman: The Secret Service. Once again directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, X-Men First Class), it is a solid sequel that contains just as much enjoyment and humour as its predecessor.One year after the events of the first film, the Kingsman's spy headquarters is fatally attacked by an unknown entity. With most of the organisation now dead, the surviving agents Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and his trainer Merlin (Mark Strong) travel abroad to team up with Statesman, their American counterparts, in an effort to bring this mysterious new enemy to justice and save the world once again.Featuring the same ridiculously over-the-top action and unique British charm, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a worthy follow-up to the 2015 film. Matthew Vaughn's slick, fast- paced direction showcases his talent for cleverly choreographed fight scenes and quirky comic relief, which few other directors would be able to replicate successfully. I am hopeful that he returns to direct the third installment. However, similar to Guardians of The Galaxy Vol.2, the film does lack some of the freshness and surprise that was in the original, plus its runtime of 141 minutes does make it drag at times. The cast of characters, both new and old, lend themselves to some highly entertaining situations, including a hilarious performance from Elton John playing a fictionalised version of himself. The real stand-out, though, was Julianne Moore as the film's villain. It's so rare to see her play such an evil character so effectively and so much fun to watch, considering her reputation for usually playing likable roles.I rate it 8/10",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
118,Alexander_Blanchett,Style over Substance,6,13 October 2017,"I preferred the first part which was original fun and self ironic. This one took itself a little bit too seriously at times. Also the story itself was not as fun as in the first one, all in all they overdid everything. Taron Egerton was fun as in the first one and gave the finest performance in the film. Colin Firth was all right but can do better, he was very much reduced. Julianne Moore was not great. I was really looking forward to see her playing a villain but the result was disappointing. Overacting and really not great at all. Thats not her material. I mean she was not awful or anything but based on her usual standards really not brilliant. Its sad to see that an Oscar winning actress like Halle Berry needs to reduce herself to second hand roles that easily could have been a breakout role for a newcomer or something. I still don't get why Channing Tatum was there as he was totally useless. Jeff Bridges was wasted in a very one dimensional role. But he obviously had fun playing it. Nice to see small fine turns by Bruce Greenwood and Emily Watson. Don't get me started on Elton John. Nice gimmick but they really, really stretched it. Good to see Mark Strong again who was decent. The action scenes were great though, especially the opening one, maybe a bit over styled and of course unrealistic but they were intend to be that. Good soundtrack as well. But one of the biggest problems was that it was absolutely overlong and they could have cut half of it and it still would be the same (maybe better) product.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
119,CANpatbuck3664,Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a Good Spy Flick That Falters in Comparison to the Original,8,23 September 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle brings back all your favourite characters from the original and brings many fresh new characters to the forefront. I must give the movie some credit here, the idea of the Statesmen could have been really hokey but as the movie goes on, you become more interested in the Statesmen agency and the major players within it. They give some added dimension to some unexpected returnees from the first entry (although the subject matter of their relationship was a little iffy, I was pleasantly surprised they brought back Princess Tilde in such a large role) and Eggsy hasn't changed too much from where it counts. There's one glaring exception to my praise though, they bring back one of the biggest and best characters from the original and I think they really fumbled the ball. It was so disappointing to the point where I almost regretted his inclusion in this sequel.With a good chunk of this movie taking place in the U.S.A and the jungle, they also introduce some engaging set-pieces and locations. I didn't get the reasoning behind Poppyland completely but it looked cool and added something distinctive. The Statesmen headquarters was a little hit or miss but it was also better than expected. Most of the CGI and visual effects in the movie are largely well done and they help sell some of the more outlandish bits.The best part of this movie is that the excellent action scenes from The Secret Service carry over. There's nothing to match the church/Free Bird set piece (which despite controversial subject matter is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen) but there are many smaller scenes that carry that same flavour. They don't waste any time dropping you into it either, 5 minutes into the movie and you're getting a neat car chase/fight sequence. So, while I can't say it topped The Secret Service, they continue their great action work with very little decline in quality.Taron Egerton came out of nowhere to capably carry the Kingsman franchise. Another positive thing I can say is that this follow up shows that his leading man chops from the first one wasn't a fluke. He is this character and he's earned the right to continue playing it. Mark Strong returns as Merlin, he was an underrated part of the first one and he's solid again here. It was nice to see Edward Holcroft again as Charlie but I was disappointed that Sophie Cookson had such a small roll. Channing Tatum slips into his character Tequila nicely but the movie didn't advertise his role properly. The surprise MVP is Pedro Pascal as Whiskey. He nails his part and he steals almost every scene he's in. They didn't give Halle Berry or Jeff Bridges much to do as Ginger Ale and Champagne respectively. I think Julianne Moore was an inspired choice as Poppy and she does a good job but she's let down by how her character is written. She's just not given as much to work with as Samuel L. Jackson was. To avoid spoilers, I'm not going to touch on the surprise return of a certain character or the big celebrity cameo.The most common complaint I've heard from fans of the first movie is that this movie is just a retread of the original. You can see parallels but I wouldn't agree with that assessment. I think this movie suffers from the next problem most sequels face. They feel the need to go bigger, to outdo themselves and to ratchet up almost every facet. There were plenty of good ideas and aspects worth praising in The Golden Circle but the movie also felt needlessly goofy. Eggsy was a semi-realistic character in the first one, he was a good kid in a tough neighbourhood that was in an even tougher situation. His rags-to-riches story was very heartfelt and it kept the movie grounded. He's turned into James Bond in this and his problems (minus The Kingsman Agency blowing up) seem much more conventional and less threatening. The rules and lore surrounding the Statesmen aren't well defined and they're importance/effectiveness seems to wildly fluctuate. Poppy isn't more over-the-top than Valentine but she seems to be way too playful and it's hard to take her seriously. The movie wants to say something about the war on drugs but the message feels vague and at the same time very heavy handed. These are just a few examples of the inconsistent nature of the movie and while there's the requisite action and comedy, this one leans into the absurd humour to the point where it detracts from itself.I unabashedly love Kingsman: The Secret Service. I thought it was so special the first time I saw it and it has gotten better upon repeated viewings. It payed homage to the classic spy movies but delivered an unconventional and fresh viewing experience. I would rank it among the best movies I've seen not only in 2014 but of this decade. But I was willing to spot this movie as many points as I could, I wanted this to be the next great entry in this franchise. Critics have been harsh on The Golden Circle but if you enjoy the first Kingsman, a lot of the successful elements in that movie are brought back. You still have the thrilling action and although I didn't like choices they made with the characters, the creative team introduces plenty of new things and they expand upon the world. The Golden Circle is absolutely worth seeing and I think most people will get a kick out of it. I just couldn't help leaving the theatre a little disappointed, Secret Service was so awe-inspiring for me in many ways and this won't have the same staying power. I would give this a 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

122,Rickting,"Basically, another Kick-ass 2",6,25 September 2017,"Mathew Vaughn's awesome Kingsman: The Secret Service was a total blast and held up very well upon re-watching as well. In this sequel, Julianne Moore's villain attacks and heavily damages the Kingsman force, leading to a team-up with the American equivalent. So, how did this movie do? Was it better than Kick-Ass 2? Well, yes, but not a lot. The thing with Kick-Ass 2 (Which isn't as bad as you remember but wasn't great either) was that Vaughn gave full writing and directing duties to a completely inexperienced and far weaker director. Here, he's in firm control, but he proves he's not immune to making sequel mistakes either. His first directed sequel is, much like Kick-Ass 2, has too much going on, gets too over-the-top in its attempts to top the preceding film, has the original film's best character (Hit Girl/Harry Hart) trapped in an annoying identity crisis and a good female character from the first film (Roxy/Katie) ditched after a few minutes. Kingsman: The Golden Circle, after opening with an overblown taxi chase, is a whole load of great moments, performances, jokes and fun action in search of a good story to hold it all together. The story just isn't as charismatic and feels more robotic and overly explosion-heavy. There are also too many unnecessary character deaths. On the whole, in spite of the many awesome performances, Vaughn's typically fantastic direction and so many scenes that re-capture the first film's magic, there are plenty of scenes in-between that don't quite work and the church scene from the original is never topped. 6/10",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

124,Java_Joe,All you expected but only half the fun.,5,22 September 2017,"Let me start out by saying I don't think this is a bad movie. It's just not a good movie. The original Kingsman was fun. It was a breath of fresh air. It had all those spy tropes that you love and handled them in an entertaining and fun way. So after it made a lot of money and got great press they decided to green light a sequel. Problem is, they didn't have a script. The original was based on a graphic novel called ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"". This one was completely new and therein lies the problem. They had no guide, they had no source and instead of crafting something original to follow up the first movie they just remade the first one but this time in the United States.Here we meet the American counterpart to Kingsman in the form of Statesman. Whereas Kingsman was undeniably British, Statesman is completely American. And when I mean American I mean cowboys and everything. Kingsman used a high tech umbrella. Statesmen use an energy lariat because they're cowboys. Get it?The rest of the movie follows the standard plot. Bad guy holds the world for ransom, good guys go in and save the day. But it's how you get from A to B that makes the difference. The first movie was fun but this felt... soulless. Sure there are great stunts, FX, direction, acting etc but it just felt empty and you're left feeling not necessarily ripped off but it just isn't satisfying. Can't give it more than 5/10. If you really want to see it, go for it but if you're on the fence I'd suggest waiting until it's on Netflix.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
125,PyroSikTh,The Third Instalment in the John Denver 2017 Trilogy,6,26 September 2017,"The Golden Circle picks up quite some time after the events of the first movie, introducing a new villain who's equally as bizarre and quirky, as well as bringing back a couple of characters previously thought dead or were little more than afterthoughts. The most pleasant surprise of these was the return of Tilde, the Swedish princess who freely delivers on her kinky promise at the end of the first movie. In direct opposition to the Bond ethos of our spy being a womaniser who sleeps around, Eggsy is instead committed and sappy. Furthermore his spy lifestyle hasn't taken him away from his chavy friends either (a Swedish princess getting drunk with a bunch of chavs is a hilarious thought all by itself).The Golden Circle's biggest sin is that it throws so many potentially interesting ideas and characters at you, but never capitalises on it. Roxy is gone before she gets to serve any purpose, Channing Tatum's Tequila is introduced before being benched midway through, Poppy's ruthlessness and lack of empathy opens up to some dark moments, but ends up being a bit of a fake-out as she doesn't actually pose all that much of a threat, and the Statesmen are largely forgotten about save for Pedro Pascal's Whisky and the explaining away of Harry's return (who incidentally is also another waste of a character, although the final fight scene with him and Eggsy is fantastic).For the most part every action scene in Kingsman feels a little like they're trying to top the church scene in the first movie, which works so well because it's so brutal, surprising, and in-your-face. Of course because every fight scene in Golden Circle is a stylised faux-longshot, they all lose that impact, but I can't deny how overwhelmingly enjoyable this action sequences are. The opening fight inside a London cab is brought to life by the camera's movements left and right, following the punches and the general movements of the characters as they scramble at each other. There's a fluidity to these scenes that gives Golden Circle it's own stamp in the action genre. Heavy use of CGI enables the action to go in whichever direction you could possibly imagine, from surfing on a car door to jumping into the boot and closing it in one seamless movement just in time before a car smashes into the back of it.On which note I have to talk about another little niggle, which is the CGI. There is a hell of a lot of it, so if you're one of those movie snobs who hates CGI just because it's ""not real"", Golden Circle is not for you. Go watch Detroit instead. I like CGI, I think it can add a lot of style to scenes, which is important for a movie as stylish as Kingsman, but maybe the CGI in Golden Circle is a little overused. There's quite a lot of stunts that could've been done for real to make it all look a bit more believable (which for something as silly and over-the-top as Kingsman is crucial), but instead they opted to CGI it instead. This would be fine if the CGI was really good quality and you could barely tell it was done on a computer, but this is not the case in Golden Circle. And to be honest it wasn't the case in the first Kingsman either. That movie had some truly terrible CGI as well.The humour is another element of Golden Circle that got carried over from the first film perfectly. It's just as genuinely hilarious, just as darkly comic, and just as risqué and in-part cringey. Sometimes the humour is obvious and garners a lot of laughs (like an old man praising his most recent opening of bowels), while some of it is a subtle wink-wink (like Elton John promising a backstage pass). Actually on the note of Elton John, he steals the whole movie. Sure he's almost purely played for laughs, but every scene I remember vividly is because of him and his involvement. The image of him giving someone a jump-kick to the face while dressed as a rainbow-coloured Big Bird is almost worthy of being framed, just for the pure hilarity of it.Golden Circle is a flawed movie. A lot of things don't make sense, even in the film's own twisted version of sense. Why are the Kingsmen wiped out? No idea. Why weren't Statesmen also wiped out? No idea. How did they find Poppyland? No idea. These things and a number of characters serve no purpose but are included in the movie anyway because reasons. Ignoring all that though, it's still probably the most fun I've had at the cinema in a while. It's over- the-top, high octane action sequences are impossible to bore, and the humour is so on-point in it's own darkly comedic way that you can't help but laugh. I give Golden Circle a high 6/10, bordering on a 7. Not as good as the first, but it's equal in every aspect it matters.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
126,CinematicInceptions,Flawed but bold.,6,20 September 2017,"I won't bother trying to keep this spoiler free, because I want to address a couple things that involve later plot events. So, I was lucky enough to get tickets to an advance screening; not the only one I know, but it was my first time going to one and that was kind of cool. There was a lot lacking from this compared to the Secret Service, which didn't keep it from being entertaining but did make it less enjoyable overall.There were some choices that were made and risks that were taken in the content of the story that I admired, which I'll talk about first. A relatively small risk was having a woman play the villain. Giving Eggsy a long-term relationship with Princess Tilde could not have been easy to handle from a writing standpoint as Eggsy gets put in a *very* awkward spot at one point because of it. The largest of the risks, though, was having the villain's plan center around drugs. It isn't on as grand of a scale as Valentine's cell phone scheme, but it does involve a major moral and social question. I thought it was a brave choice to deal with the war on drugs in such a touchy way, but they didn't go so far as to take a side. After all, a *lot* of people use drugs and a great number of them are decent human beings. One of the people in my theater gave a little cheer of approval when the ""Save Lives-- Legalize"" thing came up. In a way, I wish the Kingsmen could have been required to make a tougher moral choice, but it isn't that sort of movie. Still, I think it's a step in the right direction that a big studio movie like this is taking these sorts of risks.Risks aside, this was a step down from the first movie in every regard. Julianne Moore was not nearly as good of a villain as Samuel L. Jackson in my opinion. The action was on par with the first movie, but not better. No fight scene topped the iconic church brawl from the first movie and there was more deus ex machina than I would have liked, but Agent Whiskey was amazing to see in action. Also, it was rather inconsistent with its story, and I could tell that it was being hampered by a need for action scenes and Elton John cameos. Most frustrating was the lack of theme and character arc. In the first movie, we got to see Eggsy becoming a gentleman and rising above his circumstances, but nothing like that was present here. I guess there was a little bit of an ""oxfords not brogues"" motif with the Statesman being against drugs but okay with alcohol, but that's a stretch. A couple other attempts were made at giving the movie more of a theme, but they fell short by and large.Other notes. I could have done without Charlie coming back, especially since they kept him and killed off Roxy. I'm not sure that anyone is to blame for this, but John Denver's country roads song has now come up in a major way in two movies this year (see Logan Lucky). If you want to see this, I recommend seeing it in theaters because I know I laughed more than if I watched it at home alone. It was a bit of a let down, but I will go see the third if there is one.

131,TaylorYee94,Action spy films have to be dark and serious... That's like centuries ago.,8,11 August 2021,"'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' made me smile throughout the movie, a sign that I'm fully enjoying whole two hours. The story is funny and light, but how it is carried out is nothing like 'light'. Vaughn considers every factor of a film to make the movie more powerful and absorbing, for example, sound, music, camera angle, camera movement, costumes, and set design. I can tell he has paid attention to these details, and all of them contribute to upgrade the quality of the movie.In the second Kingsman movie, audience can expect more flavorful, colorful, and diverse action. Of course the gentleman's action with far-advanced technology weaponry is included, mixed with a flavor of Western cowboy lasso. Dilemma of sophomore slump. The scale gets bigger; the casting includes more stars (in this case, Elton John who steals the show); however, the story seems redundant. Moreover, there is limit to ignoring protagonists' 'immortality', but bringing back to life of someone who's shot in the head goes overboard. There are some parts explaining rather than showing. However, overall, delightful, satisfying action spy movie.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
132,p-jonsson,"Silly, even childish at times, but really really fun movie.",9,20 February 2018,"This is indeed a silly, even childish at time, movie but to me it was also a really really fun movie to watch.The movie starts by the Kingsman organisation getting screwed over royally by the psychopathic Poppy Adams which forces what remains of the organisation, all two people, to work with their counterpart in the United States. Just as the Kingsmen are parodies on the stiff upper lip British gentleman the Statesmen are parodies of the southern US gentleman (if you can actually call them that) only even more so. Maybe it is my European heritage but I personally feel the Kingsmen are fairly cool where the drawling Statesmen are more on the silly side.Once again Eggsy is the main character although I have to say that I personally like Harry, the original Galahad, much more. He has much more charisma, elegans and smarts. Since he is portrayed on the movie posters I guess it is not much of a spoiler when I say that, to my delight, the rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately Eggsy is sometimes quite cool and plays his British gentleman role quite well and sometimes he is just dumb as a doornail.Poppy Adams is okay but she is bordering on the ludicrous too much for my taste. The we have a certain English artist, a Sir no less. I do not know how much they had to pay to get him to take part in this movie but I am fairly sure I would consider it too much. He was just silly as far as I am concerned.The movie is of course loaded with gadgets, most of them of the variety that makes noises of varying levels of loudness usually resulting in one or more bad guys biting the dust. It is almost gadget overload but I really liked. Sometimes this amount of totally unbelievable gadgets is dragging down the movie more than anything but in this one it was mostly a success. To me Harry and the gadgetry is what makes this movie.Given that I am originally from Sweden I have mixed feelings about Eggsy's girlfriend and the Swedish royalties. I guess those parts were okay but I could have been without them as well. At least I feel that however wrote the scene with the ""royal"" dinner could have read up on Swedish etiquette. Knocking on a glass with your spoon, knife or fork means you are about to give a speech, NOT that you want the plates to be changed. A professional servant, and the Swedish royalty DO have professional servants, do not need to be told when to change plates.The actual story is, well it is original at least but I would not rate it any higher than okay. It served as a vehicle for stringing together all the stunts and jokes so it served its purpose. The worst part of the story was that I was actually finding myself agreeing with the president. This might perhaps shock some people but I am sorry, if you are dumb enough to ingest that crap, which is also highly illegal, then I have no sympathy for you.If you get upset about stupid plot details and plot holes then be prepared to be upset. There are plenty of them in this movie. To me it did not matter too much since this is not really a thriller or drama. It is a spy parody / comedy. Having said that it did piss me off a bit that this advanced organisation did not have brains enough to deal with the piece of equipment left in the London cab at the beginning of the movie. I mean, it was just soo obvious what would happen.Anyway, on the whole this movie was great fun to watch. I hope we get another sequel. Perhaps one with a Japanese version of the Kingsmen? There ought to be plenty of cultural stereotypes to play on there.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
133,EthanBJones_03,Recommended,8,26 October 2017,"​'KINGSMAN: THE_GOLDEN_CIRCLE' - 2017Directed by Matthew_Vaugh{X-Men: First Class; Kick-Ass}Starring Taron_Egerton{Legend; Eddie the Eagle}, Julianne_Moore{Boogie Nights; Magnolia} and Colin_Firth{The King's Speech; Bridget Jones' Diary}Plot Overview: When another eccentric villain appears, threatening to kill millions, the now crippled Kingsman must join forces with their American cousins and stop this villain before it is too late.With the exception of THIS movie, Matthew Vaughn has neglected to do a sequel any of his movies. Therefore, his choice to do this made me VERY excited/hopeful for this movie. And after watching it, I was fulfilled. It's different enough from the first so I can differentiate the two, but it doesn't do anything revolutionary, like the first. If it ain't broke, then don't fix it.What're the positives for this movie? Vaughn's style certainly springs to mind. Vaughn is, without question, one of my favourite directors working today. I've liked every film he has released and his style is such a vibrant & fun one. That's no different here. I love the way he shoots and edits this movie to keep adrenaline pumping in the action sequences and humour bubbling in the middle moments. Does the style differ from the original? No. But the original looked fantastic, as does this. Action sequences are jaw dropping and a blast to watch, and the middle moments are well shot also. It's a visual delight!Another praise I can give this movie is the range of performances from its cast. Taron Egerton, once again, does a fantastic job as Eggsy, and really sells the 'Not James Bond' archetype. He's everything James Bond is and isn't, and Egerton sells this flawlessly. Colin Firth is, once again, excellent as Harry, and I admire the man for his action capabilities. Dramatic experience from 'The King's Speech' and whatnot also aids him in the quiet/dramatic moments. Mark Strong{Sherlock Holmes; Kick-Ass} reprises his role as Merlin. The accent remains, as does the straight faced attitude. What more do you want out of a character? I was very pleased he reprised the role. The only statesmen that is worthy of mention(not because of performance but because of contribution) is Pedro Pascal{The Great Wall; Game of Thrones}'s Whiskey. Yes, his name is that of an alcoholic beverage but it's hilarious so who cares. Anyway, Pascal is excellent in the action sequences but I think he lacks some credibility in the more dramatic moments. Only a minor flaw but it's still something that irked me. Edward Holcroft{Kingsman: The Secret Service; The Sense of An Ending} was also great in his role of Charlie, that posh brat from the first movie. Same actor; same character; same desire to end the git's life. So well done to Holcrof; he made me want to assault him.As for minor praise I can award the film, I love the music and costume/set design. The use of Frank Sinatra in the original movie was already hilarious but they return to that style of music in this, and it is as funny it was originally. I also love the costume design for both the Kingsman and Statesmen. The stereotypes for each country perfectly shine through and are humorously executed. Then there is the set design. The main place I admired the set design was in the villain's base. I won't spoil anything but I thought it was a very funny and eccentric environment to use.Vaughn's signature style of humour also shines through. I absolutely love his style of comedy. There is a character in this movie that I didn't expect to be as funny as they were but they delivered. Each character has a couple good jokes and funny moments, and succeeded in making the movie very entertaining.That humour point is also an issue I have with this movie. Some of the dramatic moments are undercut directly with jokes, which makes them lose all impact. I really dislike this. In the first one, the dramatic scenes were still dramatic while the funny scenes were still funny. Here, the funny scenes are still funny but the dramatic scenes are blended with funny moments, so I wish they just left them moments alone. There was one in particular I had a distaste for, which I won't get into for the sake of spoilers.Now for another unfortunate issue: the villain. Not that Julianne Moore does a bad job; she was good, but the character she was portraying was not. She remained in one location for the entire film and contributed nothing to the plot until the last moments. Valentine was, debates about the lisp(it was great) aside, at least an active villain. He contributed to the plot and murdered Galahad. That made him pretty intimidating and genuinely threatening. Moore's villain just sits there and acts creepy to make her more threatening. Nothing wrong with that as a performance but she doesn't 'do' anything.Another issue I had was the unfortunate sidelining of the Statesmen. I wish they gave them more screen time. It was annoying to see them CONSTANTLY pushed to the side, especially considering the marketing campaign depicted them having a reasonably large role. I don't think its a spoiler when I say that Halle Berry, JEFF BRIDGES & Channing Tatum are all just pushed to the side without a second thought. That was immensely disappointing because I wanted to get to know these characters. Alas, I cannot.Overall, I liked this movie. It's not dissimilar to the first one but I like that. Everyone loved the first one so what's the point in drastically changing it around? It's an engaging and entertaining way to spend two hours so I can 100% recommend it. I'm not saying the critics were WRONG, but I certainly think they've been overly harsh on it. I'll rate this movie 8 'PUT_IT_DOWNS' out of 10!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
134,room102,What a nice surprise!,6,12 October 2017,"In a year of disappointing movies, it was refreshing to actually sit at the theater and actually enjoy a light action movie. That is not to say we're dealing with high art here. In fact, some of the scenes were borderline cringeworthy, a combination of bad acting, bad script and bad direction. You know those movies that put an actor without giving him any lines and he has to listen to the main character and put a weird smile or node because he isn't allowed to speak? This movie is full of those. There were some clichés and the CGI was also average.Still, it was fun. Nonstop over-the-top action that doesn't take itself too seriously and is very enjoyable. The movie doesn't waste any time and starts the action right from the first minute. There is a subplot involving a main character that in my opinion was completely unnecessary and could have been discarded.Recommended",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
135,thomasjay-2201,Not bad,6,11 August 2018,"The initial release was refreshing giving a unique protagonist and a surprisingly well made story. This film takes the comic origins of the franchise further adding more gory violence and general outlandish elements which may indeed be off putting for some, however with a few twists and genuinely emotional moments scattered throughout this film is just 'mindless fun' at the very minimum and was a surprise of a sequel, don't get me wrong it isn't a masterpiece but its good regardless, worth a watch",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
136,coreyjdenford,More of the same with less Kingly polish.,6,20 September 2017,"This review of Kingsman: The Golden Circle is spoiler free*** (3/5)KINGSMAN: THE SECRET Service had a lot of tropes which give it the immediate and inevitable success streak back in 2014, it had original tech, a keen origin story of how Eggsy (Egerton) who lacked a silver spoon turned into your everyday gentleman by becoming an agent in a secret organization, extensive training and perhaps the riskiest action scene in a modern film. With this collection of images, memorable moments and Henry Jackman's original score tying all the knots together - you could say it essentially turned 007 up to 11.This perhaps bodes well for the opening of Kingsman: The Golden Circle we open with an action upon a car chase - a spectacular five minute section which thanks to the effects team pulls off all the polish, all the moves and the quick reactions from the first. Our chavvy hero Eggsy looking sharp in a Kingsman bespoke suit, he's living happily with his girlfriend (a keen well-praised return for Hanna Alström's Princess Tilde) and his adorable pug JB. Previously we had him defeating Samuel L. Jackson's evil billionaire - here he really has nowhere special to go. That is until there is a threat of destruction and he has to go to the Kingsman's American counterparts - The Statesman. There's a none surprising return for Colin Firth's Harry Hart, who's now an amnesiac who studies butterflies, and he's fitted with an eye patch which surprisingly the 57-year-old pulls off sharply. There are keen differences that manage to shine their way; one in particular is that the Kingsman's headquarters' looks like a tailor's shop with the agents' code-names coming from Arthurian Mythos - The Statesman headquarters looks like a Whiskey distillery with the agents being named after specific alcoholic drinks. Firstly there's Tequila (Tatum who after his sterling introduction is left as a second rate player), secondly we have Halle Berry's Ginger Ale (she's the computer technician for the organization), third there's Whiskey (Pascal he's essentially the organizations cowboy who comes equipped with a light-up whip and a lasso), finally last but not least there's the leader of the team Jeff Bridges' Champagne or champ for short. Then of course there's Julianne Moore's 50s obsessed drug kingpin Poppy Adams sadly like Tatum after her introductions she's left underused. These different players do their best to keep the story flowing - but sadly despite the star-studded cast the film fails to be as in-depth as the first. Previously director Matthew Vaughn wasn't afraid to take risks specifically with that show-stopping church scene, but sadly Kingsman: The Golden Circle is left softer like a cushion which ultimately leaves the blows feeling painless. Plus at 141 minutes it's longer than the first which Vaughn cleverly uses to unveil new techniques and new tech, unfortunately this takes a drastic toll on the pacing it can feel a little slow at times.Emphatically as you'd expect from Vaughn the action is fun, they shine the brightest often thanks to some of the new tools, there's a robotic arm, the aforementioned electric whip is stunning and there's a suitcase gun. That said it's an enjoyably fun espionage sequel which shines in its action, its tech and all-star cast but ultimately fails to grasp the original energy from the first.VERDICT Fun and energetic if you want more of the same action - but this espionage sequel fails to grasp the energy which is left gasping for more.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
137,kgprophet,If the Objective is to have Fun than it is a Success,6,27 September 2017,"This movie suffers from what many other surprise successes try to do, which is 'take it to the next level'. In the process, the movies can devolve into a cookie cutter action movie. So it goes with Kingsman 2, but are we having fun along the way? In a goofy early 1980s James Bond kind of way. This sequel accomplishes what the first film did, by adding many comic (mostly comic book but also humour elements) bits to keep it from falling into cliché' storytelling. Sure the villain's lair is dumb, but Julianne Moore can do it with a straight face. There are flashy action scenes that kept my interest (the cable car sequence especially). There were a few too many subplots that drag the film into extra innings. The cartoonish evil plot to destroy mankind sometimes didn't mix with the R rated content. I enjoyed the expansion of the Kingsmen universe with the U.S. based Statesmen. It displayed how we can take this 'essence' of a country and represent it with deeply symbolic items. One great example is the character of Whiskey. A young Burt Reynolds look-alike, he is a caricature of a super cowboy with a magic lasso. The big budget film throws in gadgets and some extreme locations. For instance, part of the villain's operation is on a mountaintop, making for big action sequences, and of course blowing things up. I also liked the supporting characters bouncing off our protagonist Eggsy. It gives him some depth while at the same time a dash of debonair. The return of Colin Firth, who was a major asset in the first film, is oversold. His return is slow and one of the subplots that drag the film down. In general, I think the script could have been honed a bit, thinning out some of the extraneous stuff. For instance, there was a subplot about some dude who lived in China that I can't remember going anywhere. The problem with a summer blockbuster film is the big setup for the 3rd act. At that point, the movie is juggling too many balls in the air, and needs to resolve each story thread before we can all go home. One trap in that situation is that too much exposition is required to setup the predicament and explain what needs to be done to resolve it. I suppose the biggest complaint is the discord in tone between the cheeky spoof of spy movies with the intent to feel genuine concern about the fate of our main characters. It is hard though to extend your concern to too many characters. For the most part I had fun, the pacing allowed me to forgive some of the obligatory exposition, and didn't get too worn out at the end.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
138,dr_clarke_2,"Aims to be bigger and better than the previous film, but ends up being bigger and worse",4,2 November 2021,"Matthew Vaughan's 2014 spy spoof Kingsman: The Secret Service was a delightful hit, a well-crafted pastiche of James Bond movies and classic television spy series that combined action and humour with precisely the right balance. So the sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle, which reunited Vaughan with most of the cast and crew from the first film, was undoubtedly met with eager anticipation. Unfortunately, it isn't very good.Kingsman: The Golden Circle aims to be bigger and better than the previous film, but ends up being bigger and worse. Whereas Kingsman: The Secret Service was just close enough to an actual James Bond film to work as a tongue-in-cheek spy film in its own right, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is much closer to being an Austin Powers film, and not in a good way. Subtlety flies out of the window from the moment we meet Julianne Moore's villain, global drug cartel leader Poppy Adams, who works from a secret mountain base with fifties-themed décor, a meat-grinder that can take humans, and a pair of robot dogs. Whereas Samuel L. Jackson's Richmond Valetine felt like a recognisable parody of Bond villains, Moore's Poppy is so badly written and so over-the-top that she doesn't feel like a parody of pantomime villains.Over-the-top is the whole problem here: Vaughan's screenplay, again written with Jane Goldman, reaches new levels of silliness, whether it's people freezing like statues when infected with Poppy's virus, or Agent Whiskey's absurd lasso antics. Or indeed the presence of Elton John, who hams it up more than any of the professional actors and with much less amusing results. The fights are no longer stylish, but cartoonish; worse, they're dull. The direction is as sloppy as the scripting, which given that Vaughan has proved his abilities numerous times in the past is almost unforgivable, with an over-reliance on slow-motion and special effects shots. Vaughan starts as he means to go on, with an action-packed car chase through the streets of London, which involves Eggsy and the now-cybernetic Charlie Hesketh, whilst Prince's ""Let's Go Crazy"" plays on the soundtrack; it ought to be exhilarating, an adrenalin-fuelled reintroduction to the world of Kingsman, but it's too long and too derivative.The film isn't all bad however. The jokes may be less subtle, but they are at times still genuinely funny. Colin Firth, Taron Egerton and Mark Strong all give the same likeable performances as in the first film, and if Harry Hart's resurrection is pure contrivance, it is at least welcome. The introduction of Statesman - Kingsman's American counterpart - isn't technically a bad idea, even if the cowboy clichés are tiresome; Jeff Bridges is sadly with awful dialogue as Champagne, but Halle Berry is excellent if underused as Ginger Ale, whilst Channing Tatum impressively upstages almost everybody as Agent Tequila despite not having many scenes.The fact that the characters still work well is partly what makes the film so disappointing, especially given that it has the same writing team and director; one wonders what went wrong, or if Vaughan just got carried away with the silliness and forgot the subtlety. There's a weak attempt at satire in the form of Poppy's desire for an end to the ""War on Drugs"" and a regulated, taxed narcotics market which already has a huge customer base, as well as to the President of the USA's willingness to let the millions of infected drug users worldwide die. But it's a facile, simplistic, sub-sixth-form analysis of a hoary old debate that seems intended to appeal to the stoners in the audience, of which there are probably many. Vaughan is working on further films in the Kingsman franchise: hopefully, he can recapture something of the appeal of the first film and Kingsman: The Golden Circle will ultimately prove to be a blip rather than a sign of diminishing returns to come.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

140,DeBBss,Falls Short From The Original...,6,22 January 2018,"Kingsman: The Secret Service was unique compared to other action movies, and that's why I believed Kingsman: The Secret Service was a good movie. The problem I had with Kingsman: The Golden Circle was that it didn't have that click that the original had. I also had such high expectations, but it fell flat and it was very average to me.Story: 6/10When I think of a kingsman movie, I think of a crazy save the world plot, and this movie does have that idea. The major problem I have is that I already know what's going to happen, and a lot of movies have that issue, but for me, it ruins the whole movie because this movie takes so long to get to the point. I usually don't really care if I know what's going to happen at the end of a movie, but when a movie is almost two and a half hours long, you're going to get bored. The only reason why I gave the story a six out of ten is because I enjoyed the whole idea of a drug that will literally kill someone in less then a day with a little dose. I have never heard of an plan that unique. I do enjoy the over the top silly story and action, and to me, that's what makes a kingsman movie. Overall, the story has a unique evil plan, but a predictable ending.Characters: 7/10I think the characters are good, there's a lot of talent in the cast, and I think the villain is good. One issue that I can't ignore was the potential thrown out the door. When I saw the trailer with Channing Tatum in a kingsman movie, I got so hyped, but then I watched the movie, turns out, he only had five minutes of screen time. I wondered, why even show Channing Tatum in the trailer if he's barely in the movie, they probably put him in the trailer to get more people to watch the movie. One part I liked about the movie was the villain, Julianne Moore couldn't have been a better actress for the role. Most movies, in my opinion fail to make a villain seem like a real psychopath, in some scenes Poppy (Villain) is actually scary, few movies made me feel that way. The real downfall of Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the potential it had with the cast, but they ruined that opportunity, except for Julianne Moore, they did a good job with her role.Action: 9/10Once again, Matthew Vaughn did a great job directing the action, he's so talented at making fight scenes twice as entertaining. The choreography makes the action even more better, who ever did the choreography deserves a award. There's just one problem, the CGI, I don't know why the CGI looks so bad, sometimes it's OK, but those few scenes are just horrible. Another good part about the action is the weapons, I think it's so cool to see these unique weapons disguised as normal objects. I think the action was well done, but they could've done a better job with the CGI.Kingsman: The Golden Circle was an average movie, there are some factors in this movie that does make it a good action movie, but as I said before, ""It didn't have that click"". I knew this movie wasn't going to be as good as the original, but I had that little bit of hope that made me watch this movie. I tried to enjoy this movie for what it is, but I couldn't ignore the issues that completely ruined the movie.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (2014) is, by my standards, a perfect film. So, you can imagine, I was very excited to see this sequel. But, much to my surprise, it sucked, and it sucked big time! This ""film"" has a convoluted and cliched storyline, standard to horrible acting, and a predictable generic soundtrack. At first glance, the basic plot line has great potential. The world gets held hostage by a drug cartel called The Golden Circle. This cartel unleashes a drug which causes a deadly infection. Now, that sounds like an exciting plot! Then, when I saw that the ""movie"" was written by the same screenwriters, I figured: ""yeah, the script is in good hands. This is going to be an awesome movie! Right?"" No, what was brought to the screen just felt like a dysfunctional storyline written by entirely different screenwriters. How is that possible? They had a decent concept and a great cast. How did they screw it up? Such wasted potential! I looked at the clock multiple times while viewing this ""movie"". That's a problem, because if you look at a clock, or your watch during a film, then something is wrong. I'm not kidding, I checked the clock at least ten times. The ""film"" is over ten minutes longer than the first one, but it feels such an eternity longer. This, honestly, is one of the dumbest films I've seen, in the worst possible way. There are ways to make good, over the top movies and this epitomizes how to do it the wrong way. As for the acting, it takes a nose dive into trash. Granted, there are a few actors that appeared to be trying. Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Taron Egerton and Pedro Pascal. They seemed to be the only ones who at least tried to put effort into their performances. It's just a shame that the poorly written screenplay and execution marred them from giving it their absolute best. The rest of the actors and actresses were just abysmal, especially Elton John! Yes, they somehow put Elton John in this diarrhea dump. To be fair, I do enjoy some of his music, but not all of it. He is criminally overrated in that category! Elton John does deserve credit as a musician and singer, but as an actor, absolutely not. His performance is so bad, that whenever he was on the screen, he just distracted from the plot, what little there was! Elton John, here's some advice from yours truly, stick to being a musician and singer. That's the lesser of your two evils! Finally, the soundtrack is just about as generic as you can get. It did have some good parts to it. But overall, it was just dull and unforgettable. The ironic thing is, this ""movie"" score was written by the same composers. How did they ruin it? The soundtrack was actually sounding amateur at some points! Now, let's get to the positives in this ""movie"". Yes, there are positives to be salvaged. The only two positives are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects are perfect. Being a movie made in 2017, that's definitely no surprise! Great sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for poor screenwriting and acting. ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is a horrible movie, and it almost made my list of top 10 worst sequels. But, it didn't anger me quite enough to qualify. It had serious potential, but sadly, it just ended up being a total waste of film. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" and watch the first one instead. You'll be better off, trust me!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
143,gavinp9,Another enjoyable spy romp,7,2 January 2018,"'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is a more-than-adequate sequel to 2015's 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. It has as much - or possibly more - action, gun battles, explosions and spinning-camera shots. The star is, once again, Eggsy (Egerton), who's the still humble but now more sophisticated secret agent, and his trusty sidekick, Merlin (Strong) who brings plenty of class and exposition. This time, the 'baddie' is Poppy (Moore), a drug kingpin who blackmails the US President to make all drugs legal so she can become legitimately rich and famous - she has fun with it & is almost as over-the-top as Samuel L Jackson was!There's still plenty of Bond elements - suits, jet-setting, martini's, spy gadgets - but it's all done 75% more hyper and with 100% more tongue-in-cheek. Forced on the run from the UK, Eggsy & Merlin seek refuge with ""Statesman"", their US counterpart, where Champ (Bridges), Ginger (Berry), Whiskey (Pascal) & Tequila (Tatum) come into it. Bridges, Berry & Tatum barely have five scenes between them, but Pascal is good and Harry (Firth) is reintroduced here (through very dubious means!) Elton John has more scenes and is hilarious - an excellent cameo choice, and a fight set to 'Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting' is superb. Tilde (Alstrom) is back as the girlfriend and gets a few good moments.There's plenty of humour and jokes throughout, and I found myself smiling more often than not. It's probably a bit longer than necessary (140min) and has some slow points - and lots of dumb/unbelievable scenarios - but that's half the fun! The action and comedy are balanced well again - still in for the third film!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
144,thebricks,Very weak follow-up to the first movie,7,23 September 2017,"The first Kingsman was a very original, quirky movie with a strong cast and plot.The second starts with a very strong action scene, but it all goes downhill from there. Julianne Moore and her henchman seem like weak rehashes of the movie's first villains. Taron Edgerton also cannot carry a movie by himself, I just don't like him as an actor. The whole Statesman thing was absolutely hokey and silly at times. Whereas the English Secret Service look cool and respectable, the Americans look like complete dorks. Why are the Statesmen headquartered in Kentucky and not DC again? The Kingsmen are headquartered in London! Everything about it just didn't work for me.The finale was incredibly anti-climactic, underwhelming and predictable. If there is another, I hope they get things back on track. To be honest, I'm good with the first and never hope to see another Kingsman again.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

146,Figgy66-915-598470,A solid sequel,10,12 October 2017,"12 November 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Kingsman: The Golden Circle. After a slight break, I am back in the movie going audience and my first film is a long awaited sequel. As always there is slight trepidation as the film begins, is the sequel going to live up to the promise suggested by the first instalment. In this case there are absolutely no worries whatsoever. Any film that has such a mad frenetically outrageously special effect laden car chase beginning in first 20 seconds is OK by me. We return to the world of Kingsman approximately one year after the death of Galahad (Colin Firth) and find the Kingsman organisation has been infiltrated and destroyed by a mad criminal named Poppy Adams. As the only Kingsman agent that survives Eggsy thinks he is alone until he discovers there is a similar secret organisation in America, with their help he once again saves the day. Along the way we meet robotic killer dogs, a whole 50s style encampment deep in the jungle, and some very clever storytelling which involves flashbacks to the first film which very cleverly tie the two story lines together. A whole host of stars appear along the way with special mention to Channing Tatum who was just so funny dancing in not much more than his underpants, cowboy boots and hat. This is a film which does not take itself too seriously as there are many humorous moments and the stunts and spy paraphernalia is so outrageous I was almost willing them to be real. A wholly decent sequel to the first film. I enjoyed it immensely and could probably watch it again right now!!!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
147,ayoreinf,"Once again it's self aware cinema, not as brilliant as the first but...",8,1 October 2017,"This is still a very professional self aware cinema. As some reviewers here have already mentioned not all the characters are evenly written and some of the Statesmen agents are nothing more than time fillers, which is both a shame and a waste of talent. I don't think it has to do with the nationality of the characters as both the American president and Poppy are wonderful cartoons brilliantly performed by Bruce Greenwood and Julianne Moore, I think they simply had too many cartoons to present on screen, and some simply didn't get enough screen time to develop. But for me, this the only real fault of a real fun movie, spoofing cinematic genre as well as social attitudes with a very self assured hand. If they do want to keep it going they will have to further develop these underdeveloped roles, and I'm sure they can do it if they apply themselves.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
148,kaptenvideo-89875,007 for the nerd generation,8,6 October 2017,"A miracle has born! I just saw a mainstream big budget action movie; based on a comic and featuring superheroes (just call them secret agents); lasting 140 minutes – at least 30 more than any movie of its ilk should; and I enjoyed myself and left kind of wanting for more! I honestly couldn't see this happening. the last time I was really into mainstream big budget projects was somewhen circa the beginning of the century. This is the sequel to 2014's new kind of secret agent movie – let's call it James Bond introduced to the YA generation. This time they battle the evil mafiosos who like to urinate on other battle (hence the name ""golden ring"")... or maybe just some evil-doers or the other. Some of the original cast has returned, including Taron Egerton as the central young hero and Hanna Alström as his girlfriend the Swedish princess, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth, and there are many new famous faces, including Halle Berry, Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, Emily Watson, Channing Tatum, and, er, Elton John as himself. Matthew Vaughn has always been a versatile and exemplary director who's noteworthy for bold visual inventiveness and stylishness in his movies, from heavily effect-based, choreographed and edited fights, to minimalist but glamorous look of the world, to outlandish gadgets used to fight evil. OK, I know it's all a team effort, but he's still the guys who pulls it all together, innit? After seeing The Golden Circle"" I believe even more that Vaughn really was unofficially directing Guy Ritchie's first and best two movies for him. This movie is visually wild and crazy like a Snatch."", if the latter was a mainstream comic book / superhero project. You can have fun just cherishing how everything looks and plays out on the screen. As usual, screenplay is by Vaughn himself and his long-time writing partner Jane Goldman. The Golden Circle"" already starts with a bang, ramps us the pace and holds it, and doesn't end before everybody involved has had their fair share. There are car chases, fights (I am kind of surprises that there's still so many original fights in movies!) and bombastic setpieces involving an unusual lasso, robots, meat mincing machine and more. But you could already expect some crazy things based on the first movie, yeah? It's not a perfect movie. The characters and the plot are not really that interesting in a meaningful way (I know, I know, it's still a mainstream big budget action, it's not supposed to be that interesting). What is worse: all the famous faces joining the cast don't really have anything cool to do, and their roles are rather small, which is surprising, especially considering Berry. One could say it's kind of a lost chance but it's also true that there's so much happening that there's no need for famous faces to add anything, really. Maybe their roles are small-ish for budget reasons. But, then, why add so many of them anyway? Leaving minor niggles like this aside, the Kingsman"" sequel is a kick-ass joyride of a movie which not only looks good and feels good but left me wanting for more. More action, more surprisingly but deliciously weird jokes, more style, more of this secret world which plays something like MIB"" meets 007 meets superhero movies, more enjoyable details such as drug kingpin creating American 1950's nostalgia land in the jungle for home, more outlandish turns of events such as the U.S. president going renegade etc. For a blockbuster, The Golden Circle"" sure does have a lot of personality, both plot- and visual style wise. And for that, I applaud it! I really wish most pure entertainment movies were shorter. But ""Kingsman 2"" is 140 minutes, I wasn't bored once and left asking for more! Many critics seem disappointed by The Golden Circle"", for example, Rotten's Tomatoes' consensus says the part deux offers more of everything that made its predecessor so much fun, but lacks the original's wild creative spark. I think the real situ is exactly vice versa, and the first part, while good enough, is lacking compared to the sequel.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
149,trimblair,Entertaining but the language is very bad,7,25 September 2017,"I liked this one better than the first because it didn't have the church scene but still, the language is awful. Think James Bond but with 500 F-words and you have it. It is a shame because this series could have tripled its viewership without the unnecessary bad language. I liked the globe trotting and the use of the US branch of the Kingsmen in this one. It introduced some great new characters.

There is a wealth of potential plots that can occur, and I would be interested in seeing more movies with this cast, and the characters' premises. I love the secret organization. I love the cheesy ""real men have manners"" type of story-line. I was completely into the ""colorful megalomaniac"" baddie that these types of movies thrive on. Moore was just as colorful and megalomaniac as Jackson was in the first one. I loved the goofy science of all the gadgets. So many things seemed like a playful wink at James Bond details. I really, really enjoyed it.
Please make more of these movies. I will watch it with my nephews, as soon as they are old enough for the single, perhaps questionable sex-scene.
Highly recommended.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
151,williampsamuel,A Flawed but Fun Sequel,7,15 March 2019,"Kingsmen: The Secret Service was one of the biggest surprise hits of 2015, a Bond spoof/tribute that delighted audiences with its blend of nonstop action and witty, often gleefully offensive humor. Now the sequel is here, and while it isn't quite as good as the original, it's still a worthy follow up that wisely sticks to what made the last one work.Most of you will already be familiar with the Kingsmen, the oh so British spy agency cleverly disguised as a tailor's shop, and with our hero Eggsy. This film wastes no time in utterly destroying the organization, forcing Eggsy and his sole remaining Kingsman to seek help from their American cousins, the Statesmen, who are every bit as Southern as the Kingsmen are English. And the need all the help they can get to defeat the secretive, globe spanning drug cartel known as The Golden Circle and their rather eccentric leader, Poppy.Julian Moore is delightfully quirky and quite fascinating as Poppy. She's a billionaire drug kingpin with a powerful sense of nostalgia for 1950's America and a personality that's equal parts cheery suburban housewife and ruthless psychopath. One minute she's cheerfully inviting you to sit down for dinner in her spotless diner. The next she's feeding you to her robot dogs. In her own peculiar way, she makes an even better villain than Samuel L Jackson's corporate ecoterrorist.As before, Kingsmen really delivers the action. From the very beginning there are fistfights, shootouts and explosions aplenty, all beautifully shot. The freewheeling taxi chase is every bit as awesome as it looks in the trailers. Eggsy's showdown with his bionic armed rival is suitably intense and stylized, and Agent Whiskey has some very impressive moves with lasso and bull whip. But the best part is the uniquely manic choreography of the final fight scene, in which multiple fights take place simultaneously, seemingly in fast forward, as frantic music plays.Kingsmen also delivers more than a few laughs. Be warned, the humor here is not for the easily offended. It's also somewhat broader than last time, especially in relation to the Statesmen's American stereotypes. There's also less of the biting satire that pervaded the original (although sharp eyed viewers will note several references to Connery and Moore era Bond films.) That said, between slapstick, better than average sex gags, and moments of sheer absurdity, there's plenty of good comedic material.But none of it comes close to Elton John. Celebrity guest appearances are generally something of a dicey proposition. There's always the risk that it will seem gimmicky, or that the filmmakers will rest at having the celeb appear on screen and assume that audiences will find it amusing. But here Sir Elton is in full form as the whiny, demanding prima donna/hostage, leaving no doubt that the bitch is indeed back. And you have not truly lived until you've seen Elton John going all kung-fu while wearing a garishly colored bird costume.I should probably address the controversial tracker implantation scene. It is fairly tasteless and offensive, but also absolutely hilarious and fitting with the movie's overall tone. What I found far more objectionable was the cannibalism scene near the beginning. It does serve to drive home the villain's sheer evilness, but it's extremely cringe inducing and unfunny.Now for the bad. Golden Circle admittedly doesn't offer much in the way of clever new twists on its predecessor. It's also a little too gory in a few places, a little longer than it needs to be, and perhaps a just a bit too over the top for its own good. So I can understand why many critics haven't been as kind this time around. But for viewers who enjoyed the first Kingsmen, this should hit the spot.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
152,darkreignn,"Enjoyable, ridiculous fun",7,9 October 2017,"Let's get this out of the way: ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"" is not as good as its predecessor. But that doesn't mean that this movie isn't a lot of fun.The film opens with a stunning, stylishly filmed action scene; it's classic Matthew Vaughn, and it'll put a giant smile on your face. And you know what? Every action scene in this movie is fantastic, especially the final ""big"" action sequence where two main characters infiltrate an evil lair; it's just bonkers. There's a lot of fun to be had in this movie, but there were also many things that kept me from completely enjoying it. One of these things is that sometimes this film is downright uncomfortable. For example, there is a scene where our titular Eggsy has to place a tracker inside of a woman. Think about that for a second. Think about how he would do that. It's just a bizarre and totally unnecessary scene that could've been left on the cutting room floor. And I saw this movie in a packed theatre, I mean PACKED, and no one laughed during that scene. The awkwardness was thick.Also, I know the first ""Kingsman"" was ridiculous, but this movie takes it to the extreme. I'll try not to spoil anything, but this movie is just so campy and stupid. The villain lives in an evil lair that looks like it belongs in a Saturday morning cartoon. The president makes a decision that no person with 1% of their sanity would ever do. The tracker scene was just unneeded and also unbelievable. And I think that's where the fault in this movie lies; it's unbelievable, something the first one, even with its silly tone, managed to be.Look, I know the first ""Kingsman"" had an assassin with knives for legs, and ended with peoples heads exploding in a cacophony of colour, but for some reason everything still felt grounded in reality. It felt gritty and real, and there were real-world consequences, even with the fun and silly tone that the film maintained. But this movie feels like the makers of ""Teen Titans Go"" got a hold of it during production because it's so freaking dumb. I mean, there's a famous singer in here that has way more screen time than needed, and said singer has a fuc*ing stupid fight scene that takes every ounce of believability out of the movie. I get it, they want to make ""Kingsman"" a parody of spy films, but this feels like a parody of itself and it does not work at all.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is a movie that has fantastic action sequences, very funny comedy, surprisingly emotional scenes and performances, fantastic acting (for the most part), and manages to be a consistently interesting and fun spy movie. However, the overt campiness completely drains the momentum and will pull viewers out of the believable world that the first film built. I won't tell you not to see this movie, because hell, I'll be buying it the day it comes out, but I'll tell you that it's not as good as it could have, or should have, been.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
153,FallenEye,Kingsman: Going Around in Circles.,5,5 February 2018,"Nobody could've predicted the success of the first Kingsman, and that is the problem, because now you make a sequel that isn't quite as well prepared, all in the process of wanting to cash in.The Golden Circle in almost an exact repeat of its predecessor, only on a seemingly bigger scale. It's the same movie, just not nearly as good or thrilling.Honestly, this movie isn't a sequel, it's like an alternate version of the first one.Somehow this movie made you care less, if at all, about all the characters you cared about so much in the previous installment, while still not caring at all for the new characters.I give it 5/10 for all the things I didn't find wrong...

154,austin0731,"A good time, but cannot surpass its predecessor",6,30 September 2017,"While I really had a great time in this Kingsman sequel there really are just too much flaws for me to ignore. Kingsman: The Golden Circle does not live up to its predecessor, that's not to say that it is bad though. So both Taron Egerton and Colin Firth return in this sequel to the surprise hit Kingsman: The Secret Service. Both were really good in this film too even though personally I feel that bringing back Colin Firth's Harry Hart was a really bad decision. The explanation they gave was simply way to bizarre and just takes away all the stakes from the movie. While I enjoyed the action very much in the golden circle I really didn't like the amounts of action and the amounts of CGI that was in this sequel. The opening scene alone sets a tone for the movie to be high octane, but the CGI in that scene was so poorly done that I could not believe that I was seeing it. I enjoyed the action and CGI in the first film for what it was but this was simply too much, and more is not always better. Another issue that may be considered spoiler is: the amounts of death in this movie, meaningless and completely out of the blue deaths. There's so much of it. They killed off fan favourite, Mark Strong's Merlin and Sophie Cookson's Roxy to 'raise the emotional stakes?' The Merlin scene I sort of understand even though it did not make much sense at all and seems like a blatant waste of his character, but Roxy's death was just so glossed over and bland that it really doesn't do the character justice. I conclude that out of these two major supporting characters to have died only one should've died. The franchise cannot afford to lose both characters .The loss of Sofia Boutella and Samuel L Jackson's presence is also felt in the sequel to the big hit. Samuel L Jackson plays the over the top villain so well in the original whereas here, Julianne Moore is simply fine. The Sofia Boutella knock off however was just boring and this sequel really is missing that really strong antagonist to go up against the Kingsman. Finally, the addition of the Statesmen is definitely the highlight of the film I found each of them very interesting and they have a potential to be very interesting characters in the future of the franchise. Despite, having basically left out Channing Tatum's Tequila for the entire film; although, I really enjoyed that character. So, my verdict is that Kingsman: The Golden Circle is fine, it was fun and I did have a blast watching this film but there are certainly many flaws. The addition of new characters do show promise for an expanded universe that could play on other cultural tropes and I am looking forward to the next installment.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
155,carlos37andre,"Could be better, but OK",7,14 October 2017,"Straight to the point, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a good movie, with some great action scenes, beautiful character moments and amazing photography. But has some problems too.Starting with the good points. The movie bring once again the beloved characters from the first one (even Harry), and they (of course) are amazing. Eggsy is charismatic as always, Harry is (in one part of the movie) the elegant gentleman of the first movie, and even Merlin get more time in the screen this time. Besides that the movie has some amazing action scenes, and funny moments, that really hold the audience to the history. Some scenes between Harry and Eggsy really warmed my heart too.But the movie isn't just flowers and happiness, it has some problems too. The thing that most bother me at first was some of the special effects. Some scenes have so much chroma key on it that really take you out of the movie, and in the most part of those scenes, the effects aren't even necessary (aka all the shots in the stadium). Some actions scenes fall in that same mistake too. The characters did somethings that really bother me at some point too, because I think that this isn't the way that they will act in those situations.Well, in short, I believe that Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a good movie, in some parts it falls in some clichés of the big franchises, but in a bigger picture still a fun and very entertaining movie.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

160,hunter-friesen,"A disappointing sequel that suffers the usual ""Do it again, but bigger"" formula",5,24 September 2017,"With 2015's Kingsman: The Secret Service, director Matthew Vaughn adapted the popular spy comic series into a fun and stylish action- comedy film that continually poked fun at how silly it actually was. After making over $400 million worldwide and almost universal audience acclaim, a sequel was quickly greenlit. This forgettable sequel tries to outdo the original but is bogged down by a ridiculous plot, overlong runtime, and poor new characters. If you are a fan of the first film like I am, you will be happy to hear that Vaughn keeps the same fast-paced and sleek action that you have come to expect. The action is plentiful and the slow motion is well used to keep the flow steady. Some fans are going to love that the action here is much bigger, but some scenes are too big for their own good and so unrealistic even in a series that makes fun of being unrealistic. The final action scene tries to outdo the fan favorite church brawl from the first film, but falls well short and ends the movie on a disappointing note. The core cast is all back and each of them is the same as we left them. You can feel that the chemistry between the Kingsman has evolved, especially between Eggsy (Taron Egerton), Harry (Colin Firth), and Merlin (Mark Strong). They play off of each other really well and feel like a real family. It would have been a shock to see Harry still alive after being presumed dead in the first film, but this surprise was ruined by the trailers, which is a worrying theme for recent movies that have had twists/surprises ruined before release. Introduced in this movie are the ""Statesman"", the American version of Kingman that features Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, and Jeff Bridges. They introduced in the beginning to be a bunch of fun loving crime fighters that appreciate a good drink. However, Tatum is sidelined halfway through and the other Americans aren't as interesting as the British. Julianne Moore takes over as the main villain, Poppy, a drug lord with a plan to hold the world for ransom. Moore's character is very one dimensional and doesn't really do anything, only residing in her hideout and trying to be menacing as a poor man's Harley Quinn. She keeps Elton John, played by himself, as a prisoner to keep her entertained. John is very annoying the whole movie, shouting expletives and mocking himself, and is given way too much screen time. The plot of Kingsman: The Golden Circle is even more far-fetched and stupid than the original. The basic premise is that Poppy controls almost every drug in the world (somehow) and everyone that has used them is now infected with a deadly pathogen. She holds hundreds of millions for ransom with her price being that every drug made legal in order for her to make astronomical profits. Poppy blows up the Kingsman headquarters and every agent's home (except Eggsy and Merlin) so they won't put a stop to her plan. She ignores the Statesman for some reason even though they are shown to be even stronger than Kingsman. Eggsy and Merlin must team up with the Statesman to find the antidote before everyone dies. Multiple plot holes come up throughout that mixup character motivations and reasoning. There are also subtle nods throughout the story about how drug users aren't bad people and that we shouldn't punish them, but they are so liberally forced and unneeded that it quickly becomes irritating to hear. The film clocks in at a runtime of 141 minutes and really drags during the middle parts as the characters trek along from set piece to set piece. It's weird that a film this long is filled with multiple underdeveloped characters and plot that is given little build up. At least twenty to thirty minutes could have been cut and would have resulted in faster-paced film that doesn't get slowed down by unnecessary callbacks to the original and underdeveloped side plots. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a dazzling action movie that tries to tread the same water as the original, but is drowned by underdeveloped characters, a dumb plot, and an overlong runtime. For the fans of the first one, be prepared for disappointment.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

163,edicionccq,"KINGSMAN, The Golden Circle: More action and comedy but less effective.",7,21 December 2019,"Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong) are the only survivors from a horrible attack that Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) has realized. Kingsman is in trouble now that are just two agents but they will find a way to stop this criminal with the help from another organization in the United States.Everything seems to be bigger in this sequel... But is it? The movie starts with an amazing action sequence that establishes a little bit how fast pace this movie is in a couple of moments. The fact that a lot of the agents are so easily killed makes this movie a little bit weird. Because it makes you see like the villain of this movie is really cruel and promising but she really doesn't do much. Just like the first movie. She is just the mastermind and she has a sidekick with robotic parts who is in charge of defending her. Just like the first movie.The plan of the villain is against a part of the humanity. In the first movie were people who weren't from the richest society. Now are people who do drugs. Honestly is a great plan and this is delivering flawlessly. The problem comes with objectives of the villain that doesn't make any sense, you will understand why or just watch some videos on YouTube that explain this.The new organization is pretty interesting, but it's just so weird watching them try to gain their trust and some twists are so weird. Many of what happen in this movie is just weird. Sometimes the pacing is all over the place and the only thing you can say is ""Well, something happens, I don't know what but I know that it happens.""This sequel is decent but it's ungreat. A lot of the decision that were taken was awful, and it repeats the same formula of the first movie except for the funny training part. It could be worse but it could be so much better.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
164,AnishMisra,The Golden Circle review,6,1 January 2018,"The Golden Circle is a film co-written and directed by Matthew Vaughn. I loved the first Kingsman. It was a fun and entertaining venture. The trailer for this part too looked liked it will match up to the first part. But alas, it didn'tPlot: Kingsman teams up with their US counterparts, Statesman, to take down Poppy Adams and her evil organisation, The Golden Circle.Story and direction: Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favorite directors of the action genre. The way he directs the ventures is very unique and I guess nobody can perfect the art. Considering that both of the previous writer (Jane and Matthew, who also wrote the previous part) and Matthew himself coming on board to direct this venture, I thought that this would again be a fun filled ride (Considering that his sequel to Kick-Ass was way too bad). But this film proved that Vaughn is cursed with sequels. The first scene of the car chase got me very much intrigued. It was great. Subsequent scenes were great too with Eggsy having his new girlfriend Princess Tilde and he not knowing much about the world and Roxy helping him out. But when most of Kingsman agents died that actually just blew my mind. I didn't like it. We shall talk about this later. Lets talk about Statesman. I thought we were going to see a hell lot of it. But it was as if blanks were there in the screenplay and those blanks were filled with the Statesman plot. I was sad to see them not being used so much. I mean seriously they just had an introduction to Tequilla, he gets to coma, recovers and just joins Kingsman in the end. It was as if this character was made just to make Kingsman 3. If it was all about the Kingsmen, why introduce Statesman? Then if that was not enough we have an over the top Poppy Adams who executes people with a meat slicer (which doesn't spit out blood) and tells those people loyal to her to eat a burger made put of his meat. That was totally disgusting. Also we have a POTUS who just doesn't care about rehabilitation and just decides drug users are scum. How the hell is he different from Richmond Valentine (the first Kingsman villain). Then the final act, where we apparently have Eggsy giving Poppy a dose of her own medicine and MErlin has apparently engineered that to work at an accelerated rate. If that is possible, can't a antidote be taken out of that serum? And finally : Merlin. Why kill him off!!! He was something that made Kingsman. It was as if in this film charaters were made to be killed off. Now it's not all bad. There was some good too. The film is beautifully photographed. The locations look iconic. The action scenes are well choreographed and looked quite real (Although the VFX was not up to the mark but still better than the first part). The chemistry between Harry and Eggsy was to look out for. And finally, Henry Jackman. This man incorporated such beautiful songs and background socre to this film.Performances: Colin Firth was again great as Harry Hart. Taron Egerton is a star in the making. Julianne More was good too, but Sam Jackson was better. Mark Strong was excellent. Sad to see that this was his last Kingsman film. Jeff Bridges, Halle Berry and Channing Tatum were good but not mcuh was given to them. Pedro Pascal was a good addition to the cast. Edward Holcroft and Elton John were great in what they were given. Was good to see Elton John entertain us. Hanna Alstrom was good too and was good to see her given little time in this film.Favorite Scene: The scene where Eggsy tries to make Harry remember who he actually is by bringing in Mr. Pickles. That scene for me highlighted the chemistry between Eggsy and Harry and still reminded me why these are my two favorite characters.Verdict: On the whole, The Golden Circle was a one time watch. Was quite sad to see Matthew Vaughn trying to favor studio executives. He is much better than this. I hope if they bring a third part (which Vaughn says is apparently the last), it will bring the Kingsman spirit back.I am going with a 6.5/10.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

They also assume that the F word is always funny as they just stack one uttering on the other, over and over.On every level this expensive syrup honks to the core.It is all in the trailer which mercifully was two and a half minutes not two hours twenty one, in true turkey style the film is packed with big names taking big cheques that means they don't care that they have embarrassed there career.All the jokes nods and satire's fall splat flat, then there is the action which is hardly exciting as all is so vastly over the top.Exactly how anyone can imagine there is 221 minutes of entertainment in this grim, dare i say blockbuster is beyond me.Judging by the rustling of feet and popcorn around me this movie was not hitting many targets.The pit was reached when sir Elton John filled the screen from corner to corner yelling F-F-F. It has been i am told the worst summer at the north American box office in 20 years and little wonder it has been a summer season filled with tired laboured sequels, prequels, reboots, and remakes all lacking originality and little in the way of skilled film making, this Kingsmen debacle simply tops of a doomed industry.Who must go back to film school and learn real film making,with real story's, it does not take $200 million a pop, but it does take talent.Not F's!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
166,jonerogers,Very good all round film,8,12 January 2019,"The film centres around the destruction of the kingsman when poppy Adams hits all of them, their headquarters and just about everything to do with them. Her main aim is to hold the world to ransom by sending out drugs that are laced with a destructive chemical. She hold the only antidote and it's down to the remaining 2 Kingsmen Harry Hart played by Colin Firth and Eggsy played by Taron Egerton to sort this huge problem out and tgey do this by teaming up with their American counterparts whom they seek in Kentucky.It's a race against time with plenty of action, some mechanical dogs, ruthless enemies and Elton John who is just hilarious in his cameo role. Elton says very little but when he says his mainly 2 word lines it's just so funny.A lot of negative criticism on here but it's not meant to be James Bond it's more like Johnny English but a little more serious. It's got a good storyline, an all star cast, humour and it keeps you entertained.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
167,cdjh-81125,Not Golden But Solid,8,10 October 2017,"Kingsman The Secret Service was such a nice surprise back in 2015, I liked it a lot more than I expected to and it definitely left me wanting to see what came next in this franchise and there comes in The Golden Circle while it is without a doubt nowhere near as good as the original but I thoroughly enjoyed this film despite some storytelling flaws. I was so happy to see that Matthew Vaughn was returning for this movie, it was not something I expected and that made it all the more gratifying when he was confirmed to return. He created such a great tone and style in the first film and I didn't want to see someone else try and replicate that. He directed the action in this film very well, suitably over the top and very fast but the way he does them still makes it feel somewhat real and they're all extremely entertaining to watch. Most of the characters in this film are great, Taron Egerton was once again great in this movie I liked what they did with his character in the film, it managed to keep him more relatable like he was in the first. Merlin was actually my favourite character in this movie, Mark Strong stole this film, he was really funny when he needed to be but I loved his relationship with Eggsy and it created for some of the films more memorable moments. I liked the inclusion of the Statesmen into this world, they didn't just feel like a re-skinned Kingsman but there own organisation. I liked Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Pedro Pascal in this film they don't always get a lot to do but always have a good screen quality to them.I liked that Vaughn didn't just try and recreate the first film again, this is defiantly a different film from The Secret Service, the American setting worked very well, the characters aren't as well equipped or prepared making them seem more vulnerable. The returning characters as a whole are more human in this film, it lessens The homages compared to the original and true to function as it's own franchise and universe and I thought that really worked well for not only this film but likely any other instalment's still to come. I can see where some of the negative reviews are coming from, this is defiantly not a perfect movie. Colin Firth was one of the biggest highlights of the first film but he should not have been resurrected, his character arc was very cliché and dragged the pacing down as it had to be resolved, he just didn't have the magic that he had before and seeing Eggsy and Merlin interact and their chemistry made me realise that he didn't need to be in this film. As I said Tatum and Pascal are both good in this film but they don't get a lot to do and left me wanting more. Poppy was also a very weak villain, it didn't help that she was coming after Samuel L Jackson's villain, Richmond Valentine, who was such a great antagonist for the original but there was just nothing to the character. She had no motivation for her actions, she was far to over-the-top and she didn't really do anything leaving all her henchmen to do the work while we get a few brief scenes of her sitting in her hideout. Kingsman The Golden Circle is not as good as it could have been. It leaves a lot of characters without anything to do and suffers from a weak antagonist but that was outweighed by the great directing, brilliant returning characters and the changing up off the formula. I think the critics are being far to harsh on this film and I am still very excited for what comes next for this franchise. 8/10: A- (Fantastic)",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
168,andrew-hill515,What a disappointment,3,2 June 2019,"The first movie was excellent. The second was not very good.The threat was smaller, the personal stakes were smaller, the villain was just some drug dealer living in one place in a jungle and who wants to... Continue selling drugs?The action was more pronounced, there seemed to be much more CGI, and neither of those things were done as well as in the first film.The script was poor, and apparently being shot in the head is now a non-fatal injury. In fact, this is more of an inconvenience which the agents regularly receive and recover from.Death is effectively a non-issue. So much so that I expect Merlin to make a full recovery from his being exploded in time for the next movie.The end of the first movie was a pastiche of the James Bond trope of making love to the Bond girl of that film... In this case by butt-loving a Scandinavian princess.
This one begins with them being a couple for some reason? Does it still end in her rear end when he completes a mission?Why are the personal stakes in this movie whether the protagonist should have his way with some bird (because for some reason tracking chips only work by graphically inserting them the into a vagina, and are produced in the form of condoms...And any of that makes any sense? How do they track men?)Why does the bad drug poison make Channing Tatum do a dance and fall asleep?What on Earth went wrong? I can't even... This review is kind of disjointed because I'm still annoyed, even after this long, at this film.It's not even a good film, let alone a good sequel to a fantastic one.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

I want a sequel to revisit characters that I love and it was great to see Eggsy, Harry and Merlin back together again.It was funny, cool and hugely entertaining. The plot was far more interesting and considered than anything in the last few Bond films (a jealous long lost brother - Jesus!) and it nicely combined humour with action and nods back to the first film.Yes, it's over the top but so was the first one. It has cool tech and outrageous action but it isn't a GI Joe film, it has characters that are fleshed out and likable.As a Brit, I appreciate how the makers are unashamedly prepared to show us as being quite cool and am far happier for this to 'represent' us abroad rather than the tedious and shockingly bad recent Bond films (exc Casino Royale).It's a shame that the shadow of identity politics is affecting so many reviews nowadays. Some hysterical reviews seem hell bent on slating the film and down grading it because it didn't tick enough diversity boxes or triggered their narcissistic virtue signalling.This film gave me a great time at the cinema, developed some characters that I loved, expanded the universe they live in and kept me entertained.

171,schroederagustavo,The Golden Circle Review,6,26 May 2020,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a perfectly watchable and entertaining sequel that takes the elements that worked from the first movie and builds upon them, although not always in the most tasteful of ways.As far as what I really liked about this movie is that I think it's really fun, for the most part, and it's one of those movies where you can almost just shut off your brain and be entertained by these extreme, in your face, over the top action sequences that violate every law of physics and make no sense whatsoever, but they're cool to watch. However, the film does suffer a bit from sequelitis, in the sense that everything is bigger, where it doesn't need to be. A good example of this are the action sequences, which are really entertaining, like I said, but they often put this almost gross amount of CGI to make things look like a single take and make it as over the top as possible at the same time and it becomes noticeable. I liked the idea of Julianne Moore having this 50's style amusement park in the middle of the jungle where no one can find her, it makes no sense at all, but it's still really funny and over the top. Although I will say her character, while fun and quirky, is severly underdeveloped and just not a strong villain, per se. The villain in the first movie, played by Samuel L. Jackson was much stronger as a character I think.The Golden Circle is basically the exact same plot of the first movie, but bigger, involving more players, international stuff and it's cool, but it's the same, let's save the world from quirky bad guy/gal who wants to destroy the world. And the plot here is kind of interesting, but I think they were pushing the message of the failure of the Drug War a bit too far, and was mentioned way too often. And it's not even consistent as a message for the entire movie, because for 95% of it, it seems to be something like, all kinds of people from all kinds of backgrounds get high, it's morally wrong to imprison them for consuming drugs, drugs should be legal because if not they get sold by horrible people who can alter the process to fit their own specific evil agenda. But then, at the end, it's literally said ""You better just stick to booze, now"". So it's not consistent and when it's the first message it feels a little heavy handed. Some of the comedy stuff, especially with Elton John, didn't really work for me, it just felt like referencing things people know instead of actually building up and paying off properly written jokes, same thing with the John Denver parts.But, like I said, you can watch this movie and be entertained for a couple of hours. For that purpose, it's perfectly fine.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
172,tinovalkki,Not as good as the first one,6,25 October 2017,"Familiar from the first movie, Eggsy, (Taron Eggerton) goes after drug baroness, (Julianne Moore), after this evil woman has poisoned all the drugs in the world. With his help, Eggsy gets hillbilly agents from United States and some other familiar characters from first movie.Compared previous movie everything is this time bigger. Fighting scenes are more effective and explosives are even twice as big than before. Even though everything is this time bigger the movie doesn't feel as fresh as the first one did. Also movie feels too long for compared the story, movie is simply too long, when it does not have enough story to tell.Despite all of it's failures Kingsman: The Golden Circle is quite entertaining. Biggest problem with it is, that it tries to be Bond movie, but fails to be so entertaining. It tries to be every way bigger than the first movie. Because of all this movie fails as it's efforts.

Kingsman: The Golden circle -In this sequel, Kingsman meets The Statesman and this new acquisition brings more fun elements and doubles the entertainment. This installment fires up with some good action and spy stuff. Before venturing into this flick it's good to brush up your kingsman knowledge with its part 1 Kingsman: the secret service so that you are not lost with the characters and the basics. So this time from the very elaborate trailers shown before its release it's clear kingsman crashes down and finds new allies to crack the mission. With an ensemble cast including Colin firth , Taron Egerton, Channing Tatum , Halle Berry , Juliane Moore , Jeff bridges and seriously was it, Elton John ?? this flick promises some good dynamic action and some new spins. This time the mission to bring down a secret drug racket and save millions from the ruthless and ravishingly wicked Poppy Adams played by Juliane Moore. She is one crazy villain with hideouts designed like vintage and uses robots on the other side. She has style and her own world and she is cunning and definitely brutal behind her Charm. OK, other than a vicious villain the movie had some Solid VFX and good action choreography (particularly the cable car sequence ) and a star cast who essayed their roles perfect. The film runs 2 hours 20 mins which is a bit long for a spy action genre nevertheless pace picks up after 20 mins into the story. A definite exciting spy brand sequel to watch.

174,joshbarton15,Fun sequel weighed down by its narrative and overindulgence in Elton John,6,24 September 2017,"""Manners maketh man"" are the words that the Kingsman, an elite British spy organisation, live by. Saving the world is good and all that however, saving the world while looking sharp and acting like a gentleman is exactly what made the world fall in love with them when they first burst on to our screens in 2014's Kingsman: The Secret Service. Would they be able to recapture the same magic in this sequel though?Eggsy (Taran Egerton) and the rest of the Kingsman must stop the maniacal Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) from holding the world hostage. To do so, they must team with an allied spy organisation from the U.S. known as Statesman.Opening with a pulsating action sequence that finds Eggsy try and escape enemies in a black cab through the streets of London, Kingsman: The Golden Circle soon becomes a bit of a bloated affair, its near two-and-a-half hour runtime way too long for a film of this ilk. It's the array of subplots and over-indulgence in Elton John scenes that drag the film down a level. There's still plenty of fun to be had mind, Matthew Vaughn certainly not forgetting the comic book roots with both incredibly over-the-top action and corny dialogue aplenty. It's foul-mouthed and crude, the Glastonbury tent antics being high on the list of scenes that will most likely receive complaints however, the energy that the first possessed is sapped by the overbearing narrative.If you're expecting to see something to rival the church scene from the first film then you'll only leave disappointed but I'm glad they didn't just try and copy what was so successful before. Free Bird suited the craziness of that scene incredibly well and Vaughn finds another musical number to perfectly accompany such a pivotal sequence in John Denver's Take Me Home, Country Roads. To say which scene would be a pretty big spoiler so I'll let you discover it for yourselves.Coming to the performances, this is a well performed sequel that sees a number of favourites return alongside the new cast who fit the series seamlessly. Taron Egerton proves again why he's one of the most sought after younger actors working today, maintaining chemistry with whoever Eggsy crosses paths with. Julianne Moore is clearly having a ball as the villain of the piece while Pedro Pascal delights as Agent Whiskey, the Statesman agent ordered to help Eggsy put a stop to Adams' plan. Mark Strong, Channing Tatum, Colin Firth and Jeff Bridges ensure the film remains high in entertainment value while Elton John's cameo will have you laughing out loud, even if he does show up a few too many times.Kingsman: The Golden Circle retains the fun factor a film like this requires but it's the drawn out narrative that makes it suffer a little. Interactions between the Kingsman and Statesman leaves me excited for the potential of a third film where my best advice to everybody involved would be to keep it simple.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

176,paulijcalderon,A fun roller coaster ride that at times needed some restraint,7,22 September 2017,"Matthew Vaughn went all out and got to do anything and everything he wanted. I enjoy his movies, but I think some constraint would help this movie feel more impact-full. Because there's a lot of emotional elements in the plot who don't really hit home due to the tones jumping around. ""The Secret Service"" was a fun movie that poked fun and celebrated the spy genre. However, the sequel may have crossed the line of jumping into the comic book zone in some aspects. It makes me wish Vaughn would make ""Kick-Ass 3"", but I guess you can see this as the replacement. He's got his fingerprints all over it when it comes to the wide-lens cinematography, the yellow color palettes, quirky characters, extremely over-the-top action and of course shocking moments, which will probably have people complain that; ""everything was fine up until that scene happened!"" If you like those elements then I'm sure you will have a good time with ""The Golden Circle"". I can't decide if I really like it or just think it's OK. I'm sort of in the middle. The entertainment value can't be denied, so that counts for something though.The stakes are high when it comes to the story. The characters find themselves in desperate low points, which in my opinion would have called for some scaling down on the craziness. It's fun when it needs to be, but I think I would have cared more if they sometimes took it seriously. The action scenes are a blast. The coordination and creativity is fantastic. It's just that each one of them is set to the backdrop of some song, so it makes it look like a music video. It doesn't work for every big action sequence. Especially when the moment leading up to it hasn't kept to that fun vibe. I would prefer that when the action hits you'd be more invested and perhaps even fearful of the lives of our characters. I didn't feel a single punch because it's all seamless and flows by like it's nothing. Sometimes it works if the scene calls for it. But, if you have people on the verge of dying with time running out (and these are people with emotional connections to the main characters), then you should feel the danger and the intensity of the situation. Instead you switch to the ""fun entertaining mode"" and what could have been a dramatic tension-filled scene transforms into a ridiculous video game. Again, I think some restraint would have helped the movie. I enjoy those extravagant moments a lot, but there was some potential that was lost. The part at the Italian ski resort was the one I liked the most. Just because it was one of the few scenes that actually had some tension to the action.The cast is excellent, Henry Jackman's score is great, the transitions from scene to scene were top notch. The movie kept my interest for the most time. There are moments where it borderlines on being a step too far, but it usually snatches back before it gets out of control. The Statesmen were nice and I would have liked to spend more time with them. I did hear that an earlier cut of the movie was 3 hours (!). I'm curious to what was deleted, but I'm sure a lot of it is more time spent developing the team-up between the Kingsmen and the Statesmen. The father and son bond between Eggsy and Harry is still the heart of the series. I'm glad they found a way for that story to continue. You overall get to see more range from the main cast, which was a nice surprise. I had some issues with the experience and there are for sure many things that will shock or irritate the audience. If you shut your brain off and forget some logic you will enjoy the roller coaster. It's a ride that never drags, so be in the right mindset if you decide to check it out.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
177,Caleb_Everett,"This sequel falls flat, but it's still enjoyable",8,31 January 2019,"Once again, the action is at the forefront of this movie and I could not be happier. The film opens with a delightfully entertaining car chase/fight scene, that does go a bit absurd on the CGI, but is fun nonetheless.Overall Eggsy's adventure stateside is an adrenaline filled rollercoaster, with only a few missteps in the plot. The largest misstep for me in this movie is the villain, the villain in the Golden Circle is sadly not as charismatic or as interesting as Samuel L. Jackson's Valentine. Julianne Moore's Poppy does have her moments of cruelty that definitely shine (i.e. hamburgers) but other than those few moments she seemed slightly flat for my taste.Pedro Pascal brings a lot of fun to the film in his portrayal of Whiskey and was indifferent about Channing Tatum's very minuscule part, but he did have a few moments.The movie was fun and I would definitely watch it again, the action scenes alone make it worthwhile.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
178,svhot,"Decent Sequel, Good Acting, Screenplay is a bit weak, Still Entertaining",8,24 September 2017,"""Kingsman : The Golden Circle "" is an entertaining movie. However, it does have a few weak points and loopholes that could have been improved and made it a highly recommended movie. It is still ""moderately recommended"", though.The basic plot revolves around Eggsy (Taron Edgerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong). After an attack on their headquarters is masterminded by the evil woman Poppy (Julianne Moore), Eggsy and Merlin team up with their U.S. counterparts to defeat Poppy and her ruthless gang. Taron and Mark are good in their performances. Julianne Moore is outstanding (and quite sexy, according to me) as the evil drug dealer Poppy. Poppy runs an organisation called ""The Golden Circle"", with robotic guards and a retro diner. She threatens the world with a deadly plague. The movie has a few nice action scenes, the special effects lovers / fans will also be delighted with some cool CGI work. The editing is also good and the movie is visually appealing.However, this second Kingsman movie disappoints its fans, and everyone else in a few crucial areas. Firstly, big stars like Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry have not been utilized to their full potential. This will definitely upset the fans of these great actors. The story/ screenplay is also under-developed ; it could have been much better than what has been presented to viewers. I still recommend this movie to everyone who liked the first one. The reason for my recommendation is that it is a much better sequel movie, when compared with some other mediocre and terrible sequels.I would love to become a ""STORY-SCREENPLAY"" writer for movies because I am very creative at developing interesting and entertaining stories.

The remaining Kingsman have to team up with their American Counterparts the Statesman. Which since I am American, I wondered what an American version of Kingsman would be like. Thank you movie for showing me that.Obviously the best parts of this movie are the interacts between the Statesman and the Kingsman. I like to make comparisons between the characters. Like comparing Harry to Agent Whiskey, Eggsy to Agent Tequila, Ginger Ale to Merlín and Champagne to Arthur. It's also cool to compare their uniforms, gadgets and technology. To see how similar they are and how different.The movie has a pretty decent soundtrack as well, the movie starts off with a well choreographed action scene that just made me like it immediately. The violence in this movie is toned down from the first, but it can still be pretty brutal, like when characters are shoved through a meat-grinder. That is pretty graphic. They also seem to say the F-word more frequently in this film. Yes, they say it more in the previous, but they use it more frequently here.The final fights like the first had me overwhelmed with excitement. Mainly because they chose some great music for the scenes. Saturday Night's Alright and Word Up! (BTW, Elton John was hilarious in the movie, he's one of the best parts).I've heard they are making a Statesman spin-off to this movie, and I welcome it a lot.

The chapter one of this movie is amazing, as well as this chapter two. The differences are the actors, the actions, and the plots. At the sequel, there are at least three great actors being played: Julianne Moore, Hally Barry, and wowwww, Elton John, ladies and gentleman, Elton John!! Based on my feeling, the budget of filming these sequel movie is really expensive because Elton John appears not just once as cameo, but few times, even he is part of solution of the plots. Big applause for Elton, yeah love you!! The actions in this sequel are quite unpredictable, we never know what happens, who kills, who is being killed, who betrays, and who is being betrayed. Everything uncovers until the end of the plot, so don't worry you can still enjoy all the actions in the movie with popcorn on your hands, without being confused. There are also new machines, new technologies, and new guns that are more modern and more impressive that make you want to be a Kingsman in your real life. The equipment is so cool, like those presented on the Spy Museum in Berlin. Some surprises will come, but you will know what the ""Golden Circle"" means. Then, last but not the least that I want to review, is the plots. While in the chapter one, Kingsman is trying to change an ordinary bullied boy to be a handsome gentleman of Kingsman team and everything seems right after, these sequel offers the problems from the beginning until the end and everything seems complicated. Some critics will say that the plot is quite ordinary, about the hero and the villain, but more than that, Kingsman: Golden Circle is about honesty, loyalty, and intelligence between the state, intelligence team, and boy/girlfriends. This is a recommended movie to be watched with the one you love and how you make it proportional between all of those factors, because manners maketh man, and this time is with Elton John :)",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
183,jcslawyer,Awesome and worthy sequel,8,24 January 2020,"I enjoyed this movie as much as I did the original. Excellent sequel. Started off within the first minute. Had the same charm as the first, but absolutely qualified to be it's own movie without just relying on the past. Love the additions of Pedro Pascual (doing the best he can to maintain a convincing southern accent)...and Channing...and Julianne....and a rando extended cameo by Sir Elton. This movie had heart, and is worth the viewing if you're in the mood. Don't be put off just because it's a sequel and so many sequels suck.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
184,Brevin_Campbell,A fun flick even if it not as good as the first,8,9 October 2017,"So if you guys ever look at all my reviews you would know I gave the first Kingsman movie a 10/10. It was literally my favorite movie of that year so I was defiantly looking forward to the next one. And I got to see I really loved this movie quite a bit. It was defiantly amazing. Right off the back I love Taron Egerton as Eggsy. He is such a fun and cool character and that first half without Colin Firth being there was defiantly great. I really loved seeing a much more matured Eggsy fighting doing his own thing. It was a really enjoyable piece of the first half. I also found that when Colin Firth did come back they found a way to bring him back in what I felt was reasonable. I also found his role in the movie quite really good too. It felt natural and it made sense for his character. The movie is also really funny. I laughed so much throughout this movie and it made the experience all the sweeter. The jokes really hit hard and they each put a smile on your face. The movie also has a lot of pretty good emotional beats to it as well that really worked for me. Now this movie is not without its cons though. For instance as much as I loved the first half of this movie I also will admit the pacing in it is really poor. Things move at a fast paced and you have no time to get reacquainted with your old characters before the movie makes the decision to sideline them for all these new characters and sadly...these new characters just don't work as well. Aside from maybe Poppy, Ginger and Champ the rest of the cast fells very weak in there roles. Elton Johns felt really forced like they were juts doing it cause we did it in the last movie and Channing Tatum felt pretty meh too. And there choice to sideline there older characters like Roxy I felt was this movie's biggest mistake. There are also a number of scenes that feel to much like the original and they also feel forced. This movie needed to move these characters forward in a interesting way , but instead this film just feels to much like a rehash of the first. Overall though I would highly recommend this film despite my negatives. It is a really fun time at the movies and really adored what they did here. I thought it was fun and silly and made the experience of this film all the better and I think more people should check it out.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
185,nafodude,Crazy fun,6,11 August 2018,"The story line is very similar to the first, but again they've managed to pluck out a film the offers entertainment and a feeling of wanting a third. 
The film is slightly predictable but the fight scenes alone are worth a look in, really spectacular and the fight scene filming very unique.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
186,garethvk,Not As Good As The Original But Still Entertaining,7,20 September 2017,"Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is back in action for the ultra-secret Kingsman in the new film ""Kingsman: The Golden Cirlce"". The film opens with a fantastic action and chase sequence through the London streets and shows a franticly paced mix of action and humor.The film then shifts into setup mode and the next hour or so is very light on action and instead focuses on Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong), dealing with a devastating attack on the Kingsman from a drug dealer called Poppy (Julianne Moore), who runs her empire with a ruthless and manic style from a 50s themed lair complete with robotic guards and a retro diner and theater.Poppy runs an organization called The Golden Circle and she has unleashed a devastating plague on the world in an attempt to force the U.S. President to legalize all drugs which would allow her unlimited power and money to further her global agenda.With their ranks depleted, Eggsy and Merlin head to the states to enlist the help if their U.S. counterparts, the Statesman who while at first reluctant, soon accept the two into their confidence and plan a mission to end the threat Poppy presents once and for all. Of course complications arise for Eggsy such as his girlfriend and her parents as well as the revelation that Harry (Colin Firth) is alive but suffering amnesia and thus having no memory of his past life and skills in the service of the Kingsman.One would think that with this setup and cast including the arrivals of Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, and Halle Berry, the film would be a slam dunk to surpass the original. Sadly this is not the case. Writer/Director Matthew Vaughn has opted for a film that has a very large gap of it related to setup and exposition. The film opens and concludes with a nice action sequence, but there is really not much in between to get the adrenaline rush going. The original film had the fantastic church sequence that became one of the most talked about moments of the film and sadly the sequel offers nothing nearly as memorable. The other issue is that the villain is not nearly as memorable nor interesting as Samuel L. Jackson was to say nothing of his sword footed henchman from the original.There are some amusing moments in the film but It seems that the new cast was not used to their full potential and that the large gaps of the film that lacked any action was a real setback especially with how well the film opened.In the end the film is an enjoyable but flawed effort that fails to live up to the original but does manage to offer some decent entertainment for those who set realistic expectations.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
187,CriticalOfEverything,Monumental disappointment.,5,23 March 2018,"I adored the first Kingsman for it's fun and badass action scenes, witty humour and well, just...it's a good movie is what I'm trying to say. So when i went to watch the sequel, The Golden Circle, I was very disappointed. It's still a very fun and funny movie but it lacks a creative spark and it's filled with many holes and things that are way too stupid, even for Kingsman standards. The gel that heals a headshot? Bull***t. A headshot is instant death, especially when you're Harry Hart who's been left with a hole in his brain for ten minutes on the floor before the Statesman arrive. Some characters do things that do not seem like the typical thing a human would do, there's another sex scene joke like the end of the first film, the meat grinder to grind people up doesn't spew out the clothes and ,sadly, they ruined the perfect opportunity to show that Harry was back after memory loss by having him fail a scene that mirrors his iconic ""Manners Maketh Man"" scene from the first movie. Sure it was a good way to show what Agent Whiskey could do but come on, it would've been awesome to have them both fighting side by side. I know I sound like a butthurt fanboy but there was so much missed potential in this movie that could've made it good, if not better than the original. It's still fun and funny, but that's all it is. The first Kingsman had a good pace and there's not a moment in it that I thought would be missed potential. This one just tries way too hard to shove memories from the first movie down your throat even though the first movie was only made 2 years ago. Stuff like that should be reserved for the finale of a series, not by the sequel because we know for a fact that Kingsman 3 is currently in the making. Overall, very disappointing. It's re-watchable and I may stick it on some time if I want to watch a fun movie, but the first movie is, and will always be superior. And seeing as how Matthew Vaughn failed to make a sequel to his other movie, Kick-Ass, as well, I fear that Kingsman 3 is doomed to fail because, quite frankly, Vaughn is terrible at making sequels.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
188,boe_dye,A flawed film,5,24 October 2017,"Generally speaking, no sequel is ever going to have the same magic or intrigue as it's predecessor -- it often times lacks the newness and depth and exploration that the original had. This film is no exception to that rule, and while it was fun to watch, it was not as interesting to watch.For the most part it relied heavily on tropes that made the first one successful: Name dropping an idea here and there, and referencing something that happened in the first in order to give itself credence and familiarity. Even something as innocuous as ""up the bum"" was made in reference (and in the same context).While it wasn't a bad film per-say, it again simply was not an interesting one. The background music was most grating and cliché, playing the typical military-esque band fanfare during scenes regarding government, and there was an incredibly horrible ""country"" rendition of Cameo's ""Word Up"" during the end fight scene. Julian Moore's ""Poppy"" was more or less a contrived female variant of Samuel Jackson's ""Valentine"", playing on the quirky but misunderstood and under appreciated megalomaniac.Unfortunately the one draw that I was most interested in -- seeing how Eggsy and Tequilla, (Channing Tatum) would play off one another -- fell flat in that Channing Tatum spend the majority of the film in cryogenic freeze. Instead, the film became more about how Eggsy and Galahad working together against an evil element inside the Statesmen, again pulling a trope from the original Kingsmen.While it didn't bother me directly, I felt that it was a bit over the top portraying the United States as this draconian force that lacks compassion in it's laws and that the President is a tyrant who just wants to round up all the amoral law breakers of the country. Yes, there is and can be a bit of an overzealous culture regarding American Drug Laws (But lets face it, there are other countries that are way, way worse), however this basically compared Heroin, Meth, and Marijuana into the same class of drug, which is unfortunate. Originally the President character was intended to be an obvious Donald Trump caricature, and thankfully they scrapped that idea and went with a generic angry white guy... who eventually got impeached and superseded by a woman... There were some well placed laugh out loud moments, but honestly not enough to make this film re-watchable. I personally determine a films worth based on it's appeal to want to watch again, and to be perfectly honest, Hollywood has not produced much in ten years that I felt was worth the time to watch again, and this will most likely be forgotten about in a week. The first Kingsmen was daring and interesting; It took chances. This one was safe and redundant and relied on copying all the things that made the first one successful and instead of being daring, it was just an upgraded sequel -- even Colin Firth seemed disinterested in being a part of it.Though admittedly, Elton John dressed as a fabulously flamboyant, gay peacock landing a flying kick in stacked heals was a pretty funny moment, but still not enough to make this more than mediocre or re-watchable.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
189,akshay-ak-kumar,Part 2 is a Joy ride but......,6,28 January 2018,"I loved Kingsman Part 1. It was brilliant and something different from the Bond and Bourne spy movies. Part II or the Golden Circle is a joy ride but a safe one. Mathew Vaughan and his team play it safe here. No risks taken.So the movie starts with the all the Kingsmans killed and their centres destroyed. The only one surviving is Egsy and Merlin. They go to US to meet the Statesman, their cousins across the Atlantic and discover a drug organization called the Golden Circle headed by Poppy.As I said earlier, Vaughan and his team are playing safe. So they get back Harry aka Colin Firth from the dead because they very well realized that without him the movie cannot work since he was the star of the 1st part.The plot is safe and it delivers to a certain extent. But I missed that fun element of the 1st part.The biggest disppointment is the villain. Part I had Jackson playing the eccentric the villain to the hilt. In this part, Moore is brilliant actress but cannot get that craziness on screen thanks to the poor writing. She has one beautiful scene where she explains how drugs consumption doesn't kills that many people that guns and other items do.The next disppointment is the villian's henchman. Sofia Boutella was superb as the henchwoman with sword legs. The guy in this squel is passable.The rest of the cast does a decent job including Bridges, Tatum and Pascal. And what is Halle Berry doing in this film? An Oscar winner a decade back, I cannot believe she is doing such small roles which do no good to her resume.The only entertaining bits I loved was Bruce Greenwood playing the President of US and seems to be outright copy of Trump as President. And Elton John playing himself captured by Poppy. He is a delight to watch him and is hilarious.Vaughan also maintains the same tone of the earlier film i.e. the blood and gore and some good action sequences with the crazy background score.Overall, it is a safe joyride and I hope that Kingsman 3 is on par with 1.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
190,KathleenK22,Spectacular,9,25 September 2017,Better than its predecessor so some reviews are wrong in that in my opinion. My daughter and husband both agreed it was even better as well. The first one was very good so it had a lot to live up to. You already feel connected to the characters which makes the movie more enjoyable. It is action packed and it has humour. There are surprises and twists and turns. It is visually exciting and spectacular. Acting is great and it is a long movie so patrons can feel their money has been well spent. Waiting for the next one so hope it is not another three years away!,Kingsman - The Golden Circle
191,darkwizard404,Complete trash,2,8 April 2018,"This movie literally pisses on the legacy of the first movie. I don't understand what the makers were thinking when they were working on this crapfest.Everything about this movie is horrible. Horrible acting, horrible story, horrible newly added characters and it was unnecessarily dragged. The first movie had so many iconic action scenes precisely the church scene. I was expecting a similar scene in this film but to my disappointment there was nothing. They added too much comedy in this one which ruined the movie.Julianne Moore was totally awful as the villain. She tried so hard to be funny and dangerous at the same time which is what turned out to be disastrous. Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges were totally wasted. Taron and Colin were alright but not great. Their acting could have been a lot better. Pedro Pascal is the only one whose acting impressed me.Another thing I really hated was the fact that this movie promotes drug consumption and implies that it is okay to be a drug addict which I found absolutely disgusting!Overall this movie is nowhere close to the first movie and wasn't needed at all. And no thanks I don't want a third Kingsman movie if they're gonna be like this one.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
192,texshelters,Kingsman: The Golden Circle is Weaker than the Original in Every Way,4,1 October 2017,"Kingsman: A Golden LetdownKingsman: The Golden Circle, is bigger, badder, faster and furiouser. The problem is it expands on the overblown action of the first Kingsman but doesn't feature the same charm and entertaining snark of the first film. It is only, after all, a sequel: i.e. not as good as the first with repeated themes and plot lines. The action scenes, however, are still spectacular. This time out, the plot has so many lasso holes that it's a distraction. Even in fantasy and spy films you need to have some internal logic. The logic here doesn't work. They make up too many fantastic explanations for the action that it doesn't make sense and I started to wonder why they bothered with the plot at all. Again, and I repeat myself, the rush to make a sequel led to a script that was ill-conceived and shoddy. The parts that return aren't as good. Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is now jaded and arrogant. He lost the charm and naiveté that made the first Kingsman so endearing. The subplots are ridiculous and cringe worthy. I am not a prude, but the way they handle the planting of a bug was stupid and adolescent. If I wanted stupid and adolescent, I would watch The Hangover. And by the way, there is mucous in the mouth. Jeff Bridges' part was terrible and underwritten. Tatum Channing is...Tatum Channing, a hot piece of flesh but not a credible spy. Halle Barry plays a spy who can't get a promotion and is under-utilized, kind of like an underutilized Oscar winning actress. Colin Firth's Harry is written so the actor can sleep walk like an amnesiac through the film. Mark Strong retains his dignity as Merlin, and his small part might be why. The real winner is Pedro Pascal, who plays the Statesmen's agent Whiskey. His screen presence is reminiscent of a younger Burt Reynolds. You know, when Reynolds was charming and on top. The Elton John cameo is worth a view. It will play on Youtube within the year, I suspect. Look for it there.And the romance? If I wanted an insipid romance, I would watch ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason."" Okay, it wasn't that bad, but it was unnecessary filler and cringe worthy. What they could have done is give us more backstory with Poppy and the amusing Julianne Moore. Moreover, Poppy's set piece is hilarious and amazing. Too bad they didn't use some of that money for a script rewrite. Rating: Rental The film has a few amusing parts and the fight scenes are worth watching on Netflix, if you have time. Peace, Tex Shelters",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
193,WooderIce64,A Guilty Pleasure,7,14 February 2018,"Kingsman appears to be a real ""love it or hate it"" franchise. It's kind of like Austin Powers, with all the Bond-mocking spy tropes, only way more violent. Personally, it's a guilty pleasure. Here, after the Kingsman facilities in the U.K. are bombed, Eggsy and Merlin must seek the help of Statesman, their American equivalent. It delivers on all the high-tech and over-the-top action of the first movie, even if it doesn't rack up a body count like its predecessor. It's not a very serious movie, but it's great fun. It's still really violent though. It's got plenty of guns, whips, electric lassos, and all that stuff. Oh, and a guy gets shredded by a meat grinder. I can honestly say, that's the most brutal death I've seen on the big screen, possibly ever. There are a few scenes in this movie that make me uncomfortable, although that's not a problem with the movie. The world building, with all of the British and American stereotypes, is actually quite enjoyable and makes for some funny moments. It's an alright movie, but it has a few major flaws. First off, it seems like there were actors who had other priorities, because some of the new characters don't get nearly as much screen time as they should, and it seems like it sets them up for big scenes. Julianne Moore as Poppy, the villain, is still pretty good, but she's no Richmond Valentine. But then again, very few villains are better than Richmond Valentine. Most of the other new characters are forgettable, because they don't get much screen time. They totally wasted Channing Tatum with a character who barely got any screen time. Agent Whiskey was probably the best of the new characters, although the twist with him at the end was a real pisser. The issue with the characters is that it seems like there's a plot in motion, but the right characters aren't used in the right places. But that's alright because Kingsman doesn't appear to be a major franchise. If Marvel or DC put out a movie like this, it would be really bad. But Kingsman isn't much more than a fun time at the movies, and in that regard, it succeeds.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Every female character either sits behind a computer or is there for window dressing. And such a waste of the monumental talents of Julianne Moore. It very much has the feel of the Bond movies of the past, and I don't mean that as a compliment: the men race around, magically dodging bullets, while the women wear sexy clothing and make goo-goo eyes at the big strong men. WTH? I have to rewatch Wonder Woman just to get the bad taste out of my mouth. And the laws of physics do not apply to this universe, wherever it is. I know it's escapism, but it's the worst possible kind. I really thought that we had entered a new era of action movies, with a more nuanced take on plots, character development, and relationships. This movie is a dinosaur. Bleh. I gave the movie 2 stars - one for the weird but delightful presence of Elton John (and great use of his music), and one for the weird anti anti-drug message and the mocking of a foolish, small-minded president.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Dogs and kids should never be killed in Hollywood and to the rest of the world as well. 😉Old songs keep rolling back to the big screen, especially the 80s, so far there were at least 3 different Take Me Home, Country Roads this year 2017 in Kingsman, Logan Lucky and Alien: Covenant.

199,sujanfaster,Over the top entertainment served on a platter,9,25 September 2017,"After a much surprised successful outing at the box office, the Kingsman is back with a sequel and that is not a surprise by any means. Kingsman: The Golden Circle expands its cultural boundaries to America, but it is still a British film at heart. Mathew Vaughan leaves no stone unturned to make this one of the most entertaining franchisees of this decade.It is harsh to compare this movie to its predecessor. The movie might not score big in terms of the story but it excels in most other aspects. In this movie the Kingsman tie up with their Western counterparts The Statesman to save the world from an evil drug lord (who also happened to have kidnapped Sir Elton John). The way Eggsy and Merlin go about seeking answers and collaborating with the Statesman lead to some of the most hilarious moments. While the action sequences are much more over the top than the first part, they are still a treat to watch. This movie also continues the recent tradition of action sequences with classic songs playing in the background. It is not surprise that most of the humour is centered around the British and American cultural differences. The guns, gadgets and the cars get much advanced and the cheeky alcoholic references add to the fun.Kingsman thrives on the uniqueness of its characters. But this time around the introduction of too many characters doesn't give enough scope for some of the top actors. But hey, big franchisees can afford that these days and there is nothing much to complain about it. Taron Egerton continues his merry ways as Eggsy but this time around has more of a mature role. The entry of Galahad (Colin Firth) doesn't seem much of a surprise bit his role lacks the charm as compared to the first movie. Mark Strong is brilliant yet again as Merlin and has a lot of contribution to the humour of the movie. Julianne Moore tries her best to be the classic over the top negative character but she is no match to the Samuel Jackson's Richmond Valentine of the first. Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum and Halle Berry are fun to watch in their limited screen time. Pedro Pascal adds one more big movie to his gaining popularity. Sir Elton John as himself and Bruce Greenwood as the president of the United States add to some uncanny humour in the film.Kingsman The Golden Circle is a movie that needs to be admired for its grandeur and style. It celebrates old school storytelling with the present day film making.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

The film features, most of the original cast reprising their roles from the first film, with the addition of Julianne Moore, Halle Berry, Elton John, Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges. It follows the Kingsman needing to team up with their American counterpart, after the world is held hostage by a drug cartel. It was a financial success but got mixed reviews from critics. Some critical concerns were the addition of new characters, over-stylized action and the extensive run-time. It's funny you don't get these complaints about other comic book movies. The new characters open up the possibility of an extended universe on par with Marvel. The stylized violence both sets it apart from other action movies and is an innovative way to give homage to the source material. Runtime is arbitrary. A longer film is acceptable, if shaving the run-time down would significantly affect the plot. I'll never understand why the longer run-time is always questioned when it's an action or comedy, but they're perfectly acceptable for the Oscar nominated films or an epic fantasy. The third Kingsman film is being projected, and with their success, there is interest in making a Statesman spin-off.

It does keep some of the key elements that made the movie refreshing and fun: over the top and unashamedly comicbookey action, a sense of reality that is purposefully ridiculously stretched to the limit and some ludicrous characters.Your mileage *will* vary: Kingsman can be an acquired taste and is not for everyone. But this new episode does build on the lore by adding the American Agency to the mix, more exotic and varied locations ... to a certain extent becomes more Hollywood than its predecessor.

Personally i really liked this one more than the original it got more violent the humor was darker and it wasn't afraid to go where it needed to go for entertaining me and i like that the golden circle was able to improve on what needed to be improved on from the first one so that is why i like it also the fights were better in my mind and my favorite moments were anything with Elton John and the last fight between Charlie and Eggsy and i also really enjoyed the singing Merlin did of country roads by John Denver I felt that was a strong part of his character so overall i enjoyed it and some people didn't but that is there opinion and well i have mine and i loved this movie.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

It wasn't the A-lister-is campy-bad-guy shtick. i love spy-movies. i know what's going to happen and i don't care - i love the action, the swanky spy, the ""evil"" bad guy, the preposterous plan of world domination.oh, i know. it was the fact that the Americans were named after liquor instead of-oh, i dunno... STATESMEN!? The kingsmen are not named after tailors. it's not Ralph Lauren and Dolce and Gabbana. they are named after he legendary Knights of the round table. the characters of honour, loyalty, and leadership. the Americans, on the other hand, are named -not after the many many statesmen/women or great cowboys that helped our good country - but for the many types of booze we encounter. what a let down. i was SO stoked to see it and was disappointed how over camped this film was. there is a fine line ""reality"" in spy movies. no matter how insane - play it straight and it works. as soon as you let the kitsch overrun the camp, it becomes a farce instead of a homage or pastiche. also, Brits don't know how to write Americans without making them look like red-neck idiots.

207,Abranth-d,A worthy sequel,8,19 July 2019,"Here's my super late review of the kingsman sequel . So , "" the golden circle "" is directed by Mathew Vaughn , the genius behind kick ass and the first kingsman movie . This movie is the very definition of what a sequel should be , even though it had moments of nostalgia from the first movie , it didn't rely on it completely and also focused on its own story . The best thing is that they got Harry back in this movie , and that sort of gives you the ""men in black"" vibe. Taron Egerton was great and so were the supporting cast , but it would've been better if Channing Tatum had more screen presence . But its possible they're saving him for the 3rd movie. They also killed off a lot of important characters in this movie , so after a point you just don't care anymore. The villain's plan wasn't as brilliant as valentine's from the first movie. But the action and the adrenaline pumping music mask that. In the end , kingsman 2 is a perfect sequel with great moments of nostalgia , great action , great characters and one big bottle of statesman whisky .",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

I kept checking on its release date to be sure and see it as soon as I could.Then, I noticed a couple of things I didn't like before I even saw it. Two actors I personally don't care to watch perform are in the cast of this sequel. That would be Julianne Moore and Channing Tatum. So, I lost interest and waited until it showed up on cable.Sequels always make the ""exact same mistakes"": Throw in names that have no business being in the movie, and try to make it bigger, and better by spending more money in the budget, of which none of these things make a better movie than the original. All the producers have to do is watch the original again, lock on to what made it magic, then give it a new plot, and have at it.This movie sequel truly is a piece of genuine garbage.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

210,CinePendejo,Where's Matthew Vaughns balls?!,3,25 September 2017,"*Copied from my twitter feed.Hoooooooly sh!t I need to get all of this out of my system, so brace for thread tweet. SPOILERS!!1. ""Hey yknow what might be a great idea? Copying the same set piece from the first movie and not change sh!t! Brilliant!""2. ""Also, we should bring back an old friend who died in the last film"" ""Wouldn't that ruin the impact of his death?"" ""Yep"" ""Do it!""3. ""Let's also kill someone vital, but with an obnoxious song cue and set up in the most contrived way possible!"" ""Yaaas!""4.

I get that dark comedy is still at play here, but that GPS scene with the girl was just the worst.6. They should've hired the guys from DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS to do the CGI work better here bc this looks like dogsh%t.7. Elton John shows up here as a cameo six billion times as a joke. Wasn't funny the first time, slowly gets less funny.8. ""Hey, y'all thought we're gonna use Statesman? Huh? Tough luck, we have all of them useless for the whole movie""9. Also, can we stop with the f@king President Trump allegories in my movies?!?! That whole FOX news business made me cringe. Anyone who does this again either needs a strict rewrite or a stake to the heart.10.

HOW DARE YOU DO THAT TO ROXY AND JB!?!?!12. If I have to hear Country Roads Take Me Home again, I'm gonna scream in the theatre!13. It's literally just heated leftovers. Nothing expanded, explored, or even made coherent or developed, just copied setpieces and lack of any real bite. All they did for ""novelty"" is satirizing the drug trade for another ""war on drugs"" allegory that feels ripped wholesale from 2005.

211,Thekeybaldemasterrises,"Easily falls short of the first, but it still has heart, and I was entertained.",4,22 September 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is pretty much what you would expect a movie to be that suffers sequelitis. They take components you enjoyed from the original, and play off them again but you don't feel the creative energy like before. What's interesting to me is Mathew Vaughn seems more interested in the comic book feel of Kingsman than the actual spy parody the first one portrayed so well. Which isn't necessarily bad this movie still has campy fun. The action is Vaughn's typical brutal and stylish look, with those fast paced shots. What else went wrong though? The movie is far too long. It stands at a whopping 2.5 hours and I felt it. My sense is if your movie is over 2 hours you better have a reason, and unfortunately they did not here. Vaughn said the original cut of the film stood at 4 hours I believe, and he claims he cut a lot out. No, he could've easily cut out 30 minutes if that. The political messages in this movie are so obvious it made me sick. I'm from the United States, and I get it the presidency is not favored by a lot of people. Keep that out of our comic book movies please, Bruce Greenwood is obviously not mocking Donald Trump until he's impeached and replaced by a Hillary Clinton look alike vice president. I don't mind a political statement in film but give it purpose, make it something unique and worth talking about. The church scene in the first movie was perfect in that regard. It had a message, but made it entertaining where you didn't feel politically corrected by the movie. This was clearly not the case in the Golden Circle and if it been strictly based off that, I would have walked out. The supporting cast isn't given a lot to do, Channing Tatum and Halle Berry are not given big roles, and are probably being set up for another sequel. Julianne Moore is cringe worthy and no where close a smart villain as Sam L Jackson's was. While the other supporting characters like Roxy are killed off in the beginning, or aren't used to their full potential like Merlin(oh poor Merlin). Mark Strong I would say used the best of what he had but even still he wasn't given enough to do. I'm still not buying the fact that Colin Firth's Harry from the first movie made it out alive, but honestly after awhile that was the least of my concerns. His relationship dynamic with Eggsy was what kept me emotionally engaged and from leaving the theatre. It sounds like I hate this movie but I wasn't dreading it, and that's why I'm giving it a 7. On my scale a 7 means I found one too many flaws, but it still had enough to keep me invested and entertained. It still has good action and enough heart to keep you satisfied for the most part. If you expect it to be a decent continuation of the first and nothing more, then you'll have fun. Otherwise definitely just a rental. Here's hoping Vaughn backtracks if he's hired for Superman. Before this movie I would have been like :D, after this movie now I'm like :/.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

216,thirtyfivestories,Misunderstanding is the Real Villain,3,22 September 2017,"Eggsy has experienced a profound exchange. The loss of numerous colleagues, but the acquisition of a princess. One night stand turned committed relationship, he now juggles his affairs with a poise that appears safe from exploitation. He is a boy nesting into adulthood without any mentors. But then there is Merlin.Merlin has lost even more trusted friends, but his stubborn cheeks dam his tears. Once a meager staff member, now still a staff member but with more duties. Yet his job description is about to run off the page. An unsung hero, Merlin stays behind a keyboard, but his heart rests on the battlefield. The pair are thrust into an intercontinental scavenger hunt. The stakes have high body counts, and even higher ideological battles. The war has been raging for decades, but primarily on their cousin's soil. Now they must reveal dark executive secrets and swallow a red- painted truth that will sit idle as genocide combs the world.Two villains rear their ugly heads, but one wins the vile best in show prize. Sociopolitical conservatism, or a ruthless CEO of an illegal operation. The later's business is only illegal due to the former's blinding ignorance and rash policy penning. Of course, the business produces some questionable product lines, and fiddles with morality in the management sector, but its enemy also attempts to suppress their customers.The white-washed dome sells freedom, or a loose fragment of independence. The underground mega-company sells dependence. Their buyers overlap, and their ideologies pollute one another. This is the political strife that the lone Kingsmen must mediate. Negotiations have moved past lawyers and long tables. Compromise will be reached with surveillance and intelligence breaches. Agreements signed with bullets and deceased henchmen.The dimensions of the global dilemma are irresponsibly presented. The Kingsmen appear to uncover nuance is the conflict, but these moments of levity only hit as poor attempts to water down a gross oversimplification of the world's social climate. Making every side a villain only exterminates heroes. The failure begins when evil becomes your favorite label.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

218,littleging12,Suffers from Sequel Syndrome,4,24 November 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle does what most sequels try to do only to ultimately fall flat. It suffocates itself by being stupider, lazier, more ridiculous and can only help but pale in comparison to the original. Kingsman: The Secret Service was a breath of fresh air for the action genre. Its zaniness, humor, creativity and wildness made for one enjoyable time. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is too long, boring, predictable, CGI-infested, and ridiculous to even care for.The first Kingsman had a very infectiously perverse vibe that made the film more unpredictable and fresh. This one lost me as soon as they brought back Colin Firth in the most cartoonish and ludicrous way possible, making Kingsman go from unexpected fun to campy sci-fi stupidity. Nearly all the action scenes are too over-the-top, and cartoonish to enjoy. The film relies too heavily on CGI; everything seems so artificial and uninspired. The film goes for vulgarity instead of well timed clever jokes. The newcomers (Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, and Halle Berry) are wasted as they either drop exposition dumps on an already thinly written plot or fail to add any humor, charm, or character.If there is any good things to say it's that we got to see more of the good characters from the original, it had one or two funny lines, acceptable close-range fight choreography, and interesting commentary on drug use. All this, however, does not redeem the film for being a boring bloated mess.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
219,cschultz-2,Takes The Low Road,4,24 September 2017,"If a movie would ever be produced to show the backstory of the Roger Moore version of James Bond—what his childhood was like, and how he became who he was—that movie would probably closely resemble 2015's ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" Under Moore's stewardship, the Bond series drifted toward a critical nadir, growing progressively more silly and ineffectual until by the end the pictures were little more than parlor comedies with nifty gadgets and occasional off-color gags—in other words, much like ""Kingsman.""Based on a series of comic books, the primary similarity between the first ""Kingsman"" movie and its sequel is in the quality of the humor— sophomoric. But the first picture had the advantage of being innovative —its immediate focus was to introduce and establish the characters, which it did in an acceptably entertaining fashion. The actual story, such as it was, became of secondary importance.In ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"" the level of maturity is about the same as in the first. The difference with ""Kingsman 2"" is that when a gag is set up, if there's a choice between aiming high toward genuine wit or aiming low toward a cheap laugh, the script will invariably follow the low road.And that's only when there's a payoff at all—there are plenty of set-ups in ""Kingsman 2"" which lead nowhere, as if the filmmakers forgot where they were going, or that their primary purpose was to entertain the audience instead of simply amusing themselves.This problem extends to the casting: After the first ""Kingsman"" picture earned over $414 million in worldwide revenues, the studio raised the budget of the second installment by over $20 million. Much of the budget was presumably spent on luring a number of veteran Academy Award- winning motion picture actors to the series—Julianne Moore, Halle Berry, and Jeff Bridges are among the familiar faces joining the ""Kingsman"" cast for the second installment. But apparently after the expense of paying for the extra acting talent, little or no money remained to invest in developing the story or the screenplay for the actors to work with. This problem is especially apparent in the picture's third act, which dissolves into a melee of senseless, violent silliness.As in the first picture, ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" embraces the sort of cartoonish brutality familiar to fans of videogames. Considering the picture's unfunny gags, unpersuasive effects, absence of a compelling plot, and lethal overlength—a totally unnecessary 141 minutes—""Kingsman"" time passes slowly indeed. Even the old Roger Moore James Bond pictures were better than this.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Sure it had its issues and mistakes, but if you go into it knowing that it might not be a good as the first film, then you'll end up having a great time. Yes the antagonist is poor, the opening exposition is rushed, and a lot of characters are just thrown into the background, but even with that Kingsman: The Golden Circle is still a pretty good time to be had. Contrary to popular belief, I really enjoy Vaughn's unique style of directing, and although some might find it immersion breaking, I think it's a great way to help differentiate the Kingsman series from other films within the genre. Egerton was great again as Eggsy, and both Strong and (surprisingly) Berry provided some great performances and character depth. Although critics might disagree with me on this one, I decided to give Kingsman: The Golden Circle a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10.

The only difference is the story is more drawn out and the action sequences are more outlandish. The characters are written like cartoon characters with a lot of them doing stupidly bizarre things throughout like the US president deciding to kill millions of people to beat the war on drugs and the villain turning people into literal ham burgers.Barely anything makes sense and it's really silly - There is no regard for the laws of physics, there are robot dogs, Elton John does a flying kick and the gadgets are insanely over the top. But it's all of this camp silliness what makes the film so much fun. The plot feels like a jumbled mess because of the multiple subplots, twists and it's numerous character arcs. Julianne Moore was an interesting casting choice for the villain and she has some great scenes too but unfortunately she's underused here.Golden Circle has many flaws but it's saved by its crazy action set pieces and they are a visual delight even if they sometimes retread a little bit from the first film.

230,adam-may-bower,Not as Good as the First One,6,2 June 2018,"'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' may not live up to the original film as a whole, but it's just as entertaining, bloody and thrilling. Ultimately, this film lacks the charm and atmosphere that made the first film so special, but it's really the characters that let this film down. All the favorites from the first film were either (spoiler alert) killed off within the first ten minutes or erased of their memory, which in turn, took away their loveable character. Instead, these characters were replaced by stereotypical, whiskey-loving Americans. While they were definitely fun to watch on the screen, it was overall a poor replacement. Thankfully, these flaws didn't drag the film down completely into the mud, as there was still a myriad of things that made this film highly enjoyable and left me leaving the cinema smiling. Taron Egerton shines as the leading character once again and is backed up by great performances by Mark Strong and Julianne Moore. A surprising and completely random cameo from Elton John (that ends up being much more than a cameo) is highly entertaining, despite its ridiculousness. Overall, this film is hilarious and has brilliant fight scenes, but it is a let down for its predecessor.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
231,regula1,"Sequel tries to recapture lightning of original, gets lesser but still fun product",7,21 September 2017,"This movie feels familiar, and on two counts it is.The Golden Circle is the sequel to the unexpected success story Kingsman: The Secret Service, which was a humorous satire of spy movie tropes with serious undertones mixed in. It knew when to be serious and when to be so serious it was funny. That, combined with some excellent cinematography, made The Secret Service a thoroughly enjoyable film.The Golden Circle has all of these things as well, but while still fun it just comes off feeling like a lesser imitation of the original.Which is where the second count of familiarity comes in: 2017 had another one of these sequels repeat the same formula with lesser results, namely Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Curiously, both original films (Kingsman: The Secret Service and Guardians of the Galaxy) premiered in 2014 with both sequels coming out this year.Now, that's not to say that Guardians Vol. 2 wasn't fun, and The Golden Circle has plenty of fun as well.The film finds the Kingsman on the receiving end of a ruthless Julianne Moore as Poppy, a leader of a drug cartel who wants all drugs to be legalized. Her leverage: her drugs will kill all of its users, of which there are hundreds of millions worldwide. With the Kingsmen's UK resources destroyed, it's up to Taron Egerton's Eggsy and Mark Strong's Merlin to team up with the Statesmen, the US intelligence service featuring Jeff Bridges's Champ, Channing Tatum's Tequila, and Halle Berry's Ginger Ale.There are fast-paced, well-shot action scenes throughout, as with the original Kingsman, the standout being the taxi chase at the beginning. The dialogue is fun, but it hits a few sour notes along the way, especially in its parodying of a certain political figure which comes off as ham-fisted and forced.The pacing of this film is a problem. At 2 hours 21 minutes, it definitely feels too long, especially when there are one too many big set pieces that feel like they should be the stage for the finale but end up being not.Finally, there's a right way and a wrong way to do callbacks to the previous film in a sequel. It's OK to be overt, as long as it's balanced with other, more subtle references as well. Unfortunately, The Golden Circle tends to pound you over the head with callbacks, including literally splicing in footage from the first film in reference to characters who are supposed to be important, but for the life of me you can't possibly remember where they popped up in the first film unless you watch it right before seeing this one.Overall, I would say that there is nothing truly objectionable about this film (although throwing in lots of F-Bombs doesn't automatically equal comedy), but this film may just serve as a reminder of a much more solid film that came before it rather than standing on its own merits.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
232,TheJediWay9,Definitely Not As Good As The Original But Still Really Fun,7,20 September 2017,"""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is the sequel to the 2015's surprisingly good hit action film ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" and brings the cast back to take down former drug cartel leader Poppy who has attacked the Kingsman headquarters and they need to investigate her scheme to prevent a virus from spreading across the world. I really loved the first film. It was unique, original, and just damn fun. Matthew Vaughn really has that knack. I went in with great expectations for the sequel and walked out really liking it, though I didn't love it.From a technical standpoint this film looks amazing. Matthew Vaughn can craft great action sequences and film them with a hand-held camera where everything remains in plain sight. His special effects and visual effects teams are spot on in handling such scenes, and the set design is also really cool, especially the headquarters for the Statesman. The acting is also really good. Colin Firth, Taron Edgerton, Mark Strong, Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum, and even Halle Berry who I don't even like as an actress turn in really good performances. You can tell they are all having fun with their roles which they should because it's a ridiculous action movie, and I think that really let some of the weaker links like Berry to shine. Julianne Moore is also an actress I don't like, and I did think she was overselling her performance a bit. My problem with the movie has nothing to do with the technical aspects like direction, camera work, acting, editing, or visual effects. What it really boils down to is the writing and how some story elements are handled.For instance, it feels like this film is trying way to hard to harken back to what made the original so great without coming up with any fresh ideas of its own. This movie takes everything everyone loved about the first one, puts it in this movie, and makes it bigger by trying to be better. Yeah, it is bigger...but bigger does mean better. An example of this is towards the end of the film when there is an action scene that is trying to replicate the church scene from the first one, except the scale of the action scene in this one is bigger. There were a lot of scenes like that in here and I don't think Vaughn really thought of how to make things better while still being bigger. The villain was also kind of a drag. It was just Samuel L Jackson from the first one, but instead of him it's Julianne Moore. Her overall plan just comes across as ranging from silly and ridiculous to pretentious and overstuffed. That's where the film really falters and at times it does have some pacing issues especially towards the second act. There's some stuff with Elton John that both works and doesn't work, and that switches up the pacing at times.Like I said, there is nothing wrong technically with this movie. I just think it needed some rewrites particularly with its villain and its story.Overall I am going to give ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" a B.

236,simonpcpearson,Entertaining but a pale imitation of the first,5,23 September 2017,"It is probably because I loved the first Kingsman film so much that I felt so disappointed by the second. Kingsman:The Golden Circle is entertaining but lacks the charm and freshness of the first film. This is, as far as I can tell, due to the writing. Casual filmgoers might like it, but as a Kingsman aficionado I was so disappointed that I could cry.The movie opens with Eggsy being confronted by a villain that he believed that he had killed in the first film, a too sudden and jarring opening that leads too a frenetic and OTT fight scene that contains 2 references to Roger Moore Bond films. Returning to Kingsman HQ Eggsy has to head off to an important date by jumping into a sewer - a ridiculous idea that mocks the character in a way that the first film never did, and totally took me out of the film. Tonally the film is all over the place.The UK sequences in the film are fine with Mark Strong anchoring the film in another excellent performance. Sophie Cookson returns as Roxy . She is fine but she does somethings that Arthur ( a totally wasted Michael Gambon) should have done. This sets up the major problem with the film. Too many characters who do little or nothing in the film.After the destruction of Kingsman HQ ( not a spoiler it's in the trailer)the only surviving Kingsman , Eggsy and Merlin, travel to the US and it is here that the film totally unravels.We are introduced to the Statesmen. No problem with them on paper , and the cast are all fine, but with one exception they do little or nothing to advance the plot. You could literally remove Halle Berry from the film and it wouldn't matter. Similar for Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges. Only Pedro Pascal is important to the plot, and he acquits himself superbly.The US sequences reintroduce us to Harry Hart , who has lost his memory. I am glad that they brought the character back and Colin Firth is superb but the fact that Harry has amnesia takes far too long to resolve and is pointless. Added to the basically redundant Statesmen characters and the middle sequence is very pedestrian.The film gets partially back on track with a sequence in an Italian ski resort which is spectacular ( but OTT) and then the Statesmen basically vanish- with one exception- and Harry, Eggsy and Merlin go to Cambodia to track down Poppy ( Julianne Moore). Here we needlessly( SPOILERS )kill Merlin. This is a huge loss to the film and the franchise. ( SPOILER) the press for the film showed Merlin at the end sequence in Highland dress, but he doesn't appear. If Mark Strong isn't in the next film then the Kingsman will have lost their heart even more than they do in this film.The fight scenes are impressive but the poor script never really makes us care. There is a silly scene where the US president is impeached and replaced by a woman with blonde hair ( yes, we get it already)and the film is pretty much over except that the film has to set up more pointless Statesmen stuff, which pads out the running time even more.The film can be summed up by Elton John's appearance. Elton is not by any means an actor but he is so ridiculously camp and over the top that he is funny.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
237,stellansson,The Swedish king is an idiot and this is not T2,4,26 January 2021,"I didn't mind this movie. It's great simple fun if you're in the mood for it. It does irk me a bit that they tried to milk out a sequel from a movie which success so heavily relied on an origin story. Eggsy now having dinner with the super smart Swedish king who interrogates on topics from world politics, economics, literature and art (fact check: the Swedish king is an uneducated spoiled idiot) is not just the same as when Eggsy had to deal with his heritage in the first movie.Watch it by all means, but don't expect too much.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
238,leaugebrett,Heaps of Missed Potential,5,14 October 2017,"Some of the action is enjoyable (not nearly as much as the first film), but the plot leaves a lot of head-scratching while the special effects have some serious lows. Elton John also has more screen time than Tatum and Bridges combined, Firth is given little to do throughout, and the American counterpart to the Kingsman is far underdeveloped.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
239,kangarooconnor,Please read this and you will know why not to watch,1,21 May 2018,"Before you start I DO NOT HATE THIS MOVIE, I just really didn't like it compared to the first. Ok so when I first watched this movie I thought it was amazing and brilliant worthy to be the first movies successor but after watching it a few more times I am completely upset with how it went. Ok so the first reason why I don't like this movie is because it was too silly. The whole premise is like Tom Hanks inferno where the villain wants to release a virus that will kill millions of people, well inferno did it well this movie did not. The whole virus released into the drugs being distributed is stupid it first makes it crystal (pun not intended) clear that no one even after is ever gonna touch that stuff again after a near death experienced. And the fact that most of the movie is cgi kinda pisses me off considering that the last wasn't and even the parts that were they were good. The next part I hated is how much of a wimp they made harry. He was so cool willing to die for his cause, kicking but and then he went out in a way that furthered the other characters plot in an un forced way. But in this movie makes him a frickin butterfly studier, and after he regains his memory he still whips out gets beaten up and even though the end fight was cool it no where makes up for his previous wimperish. Also let's look at the end fight, the whole thing. The first part was good even though Merlin's death felt a bit hollow the fight in the court yard is cool and badass but it was a bit boring with no end in site too. Then came th two seperate fights with harry vs robot dogs and eggie vs robot arm guy (yeah that's how much he interested me I can't even remember his name). The fight with harry was alright is gave him a challenge but then Elton john came in and completely solved everything it was too dues ex machina. Then the fight with eggie was good because it had really tension with it as he killed robot arm for betraying them. Then there was the last battle which was probably the best part of the movie which in it, killed of the most boring villain poppy, had a big evil guy reveal which was decent in it secrecy, and a good battle with a good song. But the whole movie was just way too silly and way too bad in acting and it's use of characters. And it didn't even use channing Tatum the guy they put in every trailer and every promotional picture and he was only used for one fight scene and then was never used again as h had the virus that poppy released. I'd have to say the only part I actually loved was when eggie and the princes were in there because they felt like a real couple and there chemistry seemed real.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
240,benkitching13,"Underwhelming, but has high quality action sequences.",7,2 October 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle begins with an action sequence of stylization and quality of such proportions that it's paralleled only by two other scenes of a similar nature in the film. With that considered, it's such an overwhelming disappointment that too much of the picture is inferior filler. The latest additions to Vaughn's spy universe, the members of alternative spy organisation Statesman, unfortunately succeed in continuing the disappointing trend. They simply lack character development, and so have the impression of being aesthetics as opposed to fully fleshed out characters. Additionally,I struggled to determine whether the disturbing, brutal acts performed by Juliane Moore's drug kingpin Poppy were examples of intelligent, dark comedy or deprived shock value aiming at leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. It's fortunate then that, despite not being delivered in an abundance, the film's signature stylized, graphic action sequences, accompanied by unconventional soundtrack decisions are so incredibly compelling and enticing. Overall, The Golden Circle lacks consistency and too frequently delivers underwhelming content, however in it's highest quality moments it's enthralling.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
241,lacatusalexandru,It's not as good as the first movie but it's still a good movie.,9,10 November 2017,"Once again,the director,Matthew Vaughn made another great movie. Event hough this one may not be better or as good as the first movie,it's still a good movie and it's definitely way better than any sequel of the James Bond movies with Daniel Craig.What I've liked about this movie were the action scenes,the humor,the gadgets and the actors who played their roles very good. As for the story and its villain? Well,the story was pretty good and the villain was kinda okay,it wasn't better than the villain from the first movie,that's for sure.What I really liked about this movie was the fact that they brought back the Colin Firth character(Galahad),who played his role very good alongside Taron Egerton. So,I really don't know if they will make another Kingsman movie or not,but I think that the ending of this movie will be the perfect time to end the franchise because,by the look of this movie,we will definitely not see Mark Strong and Sophie Cookson characters because,Spoiler Alert,their characters will die. Overall,the movie was pretty good but as I said earlier,it would be perfect if this will be the last Kingsman movie or at least stop at the 3rd movie,before the franchise might become the next James Bond franchise. And by that I'm saying that after the 2nd James Bond movie,the rest of the James Bond movies,played by Daniel Craig, had become kinda boring and they stopped bringing something new to the franchise.They only continued doing the same things that they did in the first 2 James Bond movies with Daniel Craig. So,I really hope that the director will know when to stop with the franchise and that would probably happen after they will do at least 1 more movie after this one.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
242,syqcs,Kingsman: The Golden Circle,5,3 April 2020,"It's a lot worse than the first one. There are many loopholes in the plot. What I can't accept most is that so many people died at the beginning and they are so important in the first one. The fighting part is still very cool, which makes me feel very exciting",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
243,TheJohnnyPHreak,A Flat Sequel,6,15 December 2018,"I adore the first Kingsman film. It was exactly what I didn't know I needed. A star-studded bonkers action film with twists and vulgarity. Taron Egerton runs away with the huge starring role. Colin Firth did an excellent job of being the James Bond type mentor. And as per usual Samuel L Jackson stands out as the villain of the film. The film had crazy action set pieces (that church battle will go down as one of the best action scenes of all time). I was extremely hyped leaving the theater after seeing that. It was a film that screamed for a sequel.Then a sequel was released. And now I'm rethinking that we even needed a sequel. For one thing, one of the main characters dies in the first one. It's a twist that drives characters and the end of the story. That twist is thrown out of the window when it is revealed (in the trailers) that the character comes back. Why? It would have been very easy to go on with a story of the Kingsman and have him honored. With this sequel, there was a new villain played by Julianne Moore. They were adding in an American section of the Kingsmen led Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum, and Pedro Pascal. It had all the makings of a fun R-rated sequel to a surprise hit.This is not the first film. Fans of the first film will be left angry. I know I was. The story wasn't interesting enough to keep my attention. I was waiting for the next action scene between the slow moments. And even though they are bananas, the action scenes didn't wow me. The plot follows a drug lord (Moore) who after crippling the Kingsmen, they must team up with an American counterpart to take her down. I get that these films are a parody of Bond films, mainly the Roger Moore era. But this film much more the first seems like a paint by the number spy action film.It seems like most of the actors are going through the motions. Or at times just playing extensions of themselves. And one of the most prominent stars is only in a third of the film. There was just an element of fun missing from this film. It seems the person having the most fun is Elton John. He gets to play an exaggerated version of himself and it's the most entertaining moments in the film. I would love to see him show up in future installments as an honorary Kingsmen. A cast that includes Halle Berry as well, they all seem underused in their roles.Matthew Vaughn definitely goes all out with this film. His direction was fit for the 3D version of this film. He knows how to stage and shoot a wild action scene. But it seems he left the story behind. I don't know if it was studio influence or not. Layer Cake, X-Men: First Class and the first film show of his talents as a director so well. With this film, it seems like most everyone was sleepwalking.The action scenes are over the top, the comedy is gross and the characters are not interesting. The film falls flat overall. Julianne isn't as compelling as Sam Jackson. Cutting a main actor out of most of the film was a bad idea. But Elton John steals every scene he's in. The flashes of awesomeness with this film are very few are far between. If a third film is made I would like to see more than just an R-rated Roger Moore parody. It should honor the genre in the way Airplane and Hot Fuzz do.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

248,dpg-87522,So far to be as good as the first one.,5,16 September 2019,"Kingsman was a real surprise, a movie with a great story, good characters, and a good villain, something that unfortunately does not have this second installment, the villain or well the villain has silly and meaningless motives like all the other villains in the movies boring and mediocre action, why? Well, the answer would be that it simply makes no sense to his plan, to poison all drugs so that the people who take drugs get poisoned, and telling the president that if he legalizes the drug, she will give them the antidote, this is not logical, because If the president has agreed to his request and the drug has been legalized, by simple logic she would be left without a job or if she had killed them she would be without clients. And that they put the drug addicts in cages is silly, they could simply put them all in a large cage instead of manufacturing all those cages, and that in the end they send the antidotes through drones and drop them there is illogical , because someone might grab many and instead of giving them the bandages or something, and I wonder what they did with all the cages when they released people? Personally, he also felt somewhat rushed about killing all the Kingsman at the beginning of the movie, I just say that Poppy discovered everyone's locations relatively easily, and the emergency plan in case the Kingsman dies was to take a bottle of an alcoholic drink to the bottom so that they see inside the container where they have to go, but I wonder what would have happened if they had not finished the bottle? Well, thank God they did it, right? But what really bothers me is that Harry is alive, they just grabbed the emotion you felt when he was killed in the one and threw it in the trash, that the States Man has their bags to save from bullets to the head, I don't believe it, it's pure plot convenience. On top of that, the only thing Harry brings is to look bad, the movie literally ridicules him, and just like Elton John, let alone say it. But with all the above said, that does not mean that I cannot see how good this second installment has, if the violence is good as in the first, the tools are creative but convenient. Merlin's death was a good thing, daring as with Harry, the moment touches you, I hope this time they won't ruin him and leave him dead. In conclusion Kingsman the golden circle is a film that leaves much to be desired, because to tell the truth the movie did entertain me, but it contains a simplistic plot, entertaining moments of action, and it is something predictable simply the movie is lowered to the level of films of mediocre action that people love so much, but a little better 5/10.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
249,six2561,Entertaining,7,3 October 2017,"Cartoonish-type plot, totally silly. But we laughed throughout and were entertained. Two words...ELTON JOHN! Hysterical to this 56 year old lady and her 64 year old husband. Understandably millennials won't share the same heartfelt enjoyment in seeing Sir Elton John in this role. But he was great & he made us Laugh! We only wished he would've belted out one of his hits from the piano loft in the last scene. (or even during the end credits) Julianne Moore was perfectly wonderful as the villain, she never disappoints. In fact, most all the cast did a good job keeping the story moving along and with much comic relief! Halle Berry was the only disappointment as Ginger.

252,travishouze,"This ""Kingsman"" Isn't Well Tailored",5,21 September 2017,"""Manners maketh the man"" was the words that rung to my impressed first experience seeing Kingsman: The Secret Service back in 2015. A fairly well tailored action movie with just the right amount of over the top moments to keep some surprises around the corner. So of course I went in with high hopes with Kingsman: The Golden Circle given we got Matthew Vaughn directing and he never returns for sequels.The film takes place shortly after the first film as Eggsy has grown into his own as a Kingsman facing old rivals from the program and Poppy (Julianne Moore) beginning to spread a virus through recreational drugs that could kill millions. When the Kingsman's profiles are compromised, they find solace with the American Statesman to help take down this threat.Taron Edgarton really wears his confidence well as Eggsy as he's able to still balance his responsibilities while still feeling like the character I liked in the first film. I had my reservations seeing Colin Firth was returning given the scenario of the first film, but they add enough to explain his return, even if it is a head scratcher watching them explain.Alas, the film suffers from most follow up movies suffer from.......""sequelitis"". The camera work doubles down on the dizzying and jittery spinning from the first movie. This makes the action almost illegible to know what exactly is happening (thankfully this movie isn't in 3D, or be ready with a barf bag). What makes matters worse with the background in most scenes look severally fake and not blended well with the subjects. Even the film suffers from making Poppy virtually no different from Samuel L. Jackson's character in the first film as a strange talking villain who terrorizes the worlds most often used recreational items to exploit their dependency's on it to their death. And it takes adds one too many subplots as it's 141 minute runtime wears a bit heavy afterwhile.Kingsman: The Golden Circle has its fun and crazy moments, but it doesn't do too much to propel the story forward as it does stick to what your used to. I think audiences will have a good time if you saw the original, but I still feel the film has too much of a loose fit on its shoulders.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
253,goodtime-336-74081,Missed it by that much,6,20 September 2017,"The first Kingsman was a classy effort that was well received and deservedly so. Kingsman: The Golden Circle - not so much. British Director Matthew Vaughn showed his class with the first movie but has gone too American with the second. The production values are still high but the script and story line head for the gutter as usual when they try to Americanise quality English productions. This was obviously tailored for the US market so they had to DUMB it down because as everyone know the Americans have no sense of subtly, everything has to be spelled out for most of them in Bold Face. The movie had its great stunts and some very humorous moments but stooped to unnecessary crudeness at times. At 2 hrs 21 minutes it was about 45 minutes too long.

257,chriskylie,Enjoyable stuff for fans of the first Kingsman,6,14 August 2020,"Sequels always have a tough job to please everyone. On the one hand you want to maintain a level of familiarity to replicate the original's success. On the other you inevitably have to bring something new to counteract the natural lack of novelty and freshness. Kingsman: The Golden Circle almost pulls this feat off. Fans will still enjoy the hyper-stylised violence, the delicately balanced humour and the charisma of Egerton still on-form as loveable rogue Eggsy. The new element, our friends across the pond in Statesman, just about works thanks to an array of Hollywood's finest. That said the plot hardly strays far from that of the original - more of a stretch here would have been welcome. The foul language is dialled up a notch for some unknown reason and whilst one scene is unnecessarily crude, the fun of the franchise isn't at all diminished. There's just about enough freshness to make The Golden Circle stand on its own two feet (principally down to a very likeable cast, and one particular cameo clearly loving every second). If there's a third instalment, which I hope there is, a bit more originality in the story would help proceedings.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

This movie goes down in history for me as the single worst sequel I have ever seen which is such a shame as I was expecting this to turn into a fantastic franchise - a cross between Bond and Austin Powers, but what we ended up with was a less funny version of Spy Kids.

259,Mohican15,"Convoluted, smutty, unrealistic and Disappointing!!!",3,23 September 2017,"In the words of Professor X: ""What a disappointment you are!"" That pretty much sums up the entire film of Kingsman: The Golden Circle! I found the first Kingsman movie, fun, thrilling and pretty cool and so went into Kingsman 2 with high hopes and was very badly disappointed.... The film hit the ground running but fairly soon after just hit the ground! At the beginning I was excited and looking forward to the rest of the film, but about a quarter way IN and I was already regretting buying my tickets! Upon watching this film I was quickly hit with one problem after another! The dialogue, the characters, the plot, the script, some of the acting and even a few of the cameos... The rather creepy and un-funny presence of Elton John swearing like a sailor only added to the convoluted mess of Kingsman 2! LET'S BREAK IT DOWN! One thing I REALLY noticed about Kingsman: The Golden Circle was how almost all of the fun and charisma of the first film was completely lost! The amusing jokes and catch phrases of the first film were replaced with EVEN MORE SWEARING!!! It just about reached the limit in number 1 but in 2 there seems to be a f*** or sh** every 2 seconds and THAT for 2 hours and 21 minutes (personally) drove me crazy! Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman have definitely traded in quality for quantity with all the big locations and big fight scenes but while the first film was semi-grounded in reality, this film is seriously bordering on the sci-fi element with: robot dogs, human flesh burgers, butterfly hallucinations, a blue vein disease and giant stacked-up towers of prison cages! It's quite frankly ridiculous but unfortunately the problems don't end there! The dialogue is pathetic and immature and really drags the film down, and the characters! Julianne Moore's villainess Poppy is a pathetic and rather sad joke! She's completely 2 dimensional and like Channing Tatum or Halle Berry's characters feels like she's just there to look good, she offers almost no presence to speak of and unlike Samuel L Jackson's villain has no reason for her actions and just convolutes the film even further. The only other villain to speak of is the chain-fisted Charlie (yes, that is his name!). Resurrected all the way from Kingsman 1, it feels like this was done in a last-bit attempt to give us an ACTUAL villain! Not bad performances by Taron Egerton and Colin Firth but they are SERIOUSLY let down by the script. Pedro Pascal offers a enjoyable performance as the gun-twirling, lasso wiping, Statseman agent Whiskey, but his back story is completely made way for yet more forgettable plot. Mark Strong provides a fairly enjoyable performance as Merlin, but because of the dreadful script, you end up not really caring when he dies! Not bad fight scenes but the sci-fi element ruins them and turns them into a joke: the robot dogs and death-causing paint bomb. Another big problem in this film is the smut and filth! There is a scene in this film which one would expect to be in a cheap porno and while some might find it funny, I found that it made a already lousy film even worse! All these elements, characters and scenes stuffed the film to bursting-point and kept it that way! CONVOLUTED is the word! There were a few slightly enjoyable twists, SLIGHTLY, but these still did little to revive the dead carcass of Kingsman: the Golden Circle! Love the first one and loathe the second!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

263,metztex,"Really, more politics and America Bashing!!",1,14 December 2019,"My summary says it all. This movie could have been so much better if they had left out the politics and America bashing. The first movie was okay and if they had built on that it would have been good. This one, they make an American Presidency look worse than Stalin or Hitler and no American President before or now has even scratched that surface. Additionally, it made other Americans look bad.As such, writing was very bad despite the decent acting and a decent cast. I will never own this film and very glad I didn't go see this on in the theater (I would have walked out and asked for my money back) and I didn't even spend a dollar to rent this flop.Stay away! Very bad!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
264,notom-23012,Blah.. US BS... Blah... US BS... Blah Blah,3,14 October 2017,"Although this review might not 'seem' to relate to the film - it is, in actuality an overall review of several titles that have the same core values.So, here we are again (apparently)... you know, the Americans saving the day - or more familiarly, saving the Brits.Yes... the Americans won the 1st and 2nd World Wars - of course, the US didn't enter the first world war until 1917 (it started in 1914, by the way - and, up until their 'rescue' they'd been selling arms to both sides of the conflict with huge financial gain)That aside, they 'rescued' the Brits again during the 2nd World War, which started in 1939 but didn't see a US face until late 1941. Once again, before entering the conflict, the US had been selling arms (to multiple sides this time) - hey... 'It's all about the money.. money..' (i think that's how the song goes).But.. we should, by now, have gotten used Americas re-writing of History - I mean, didn't they manage to capture the 'Enigma Machine' - responsible for the saving of countless lives? It must be true - I saw Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton in it!But all of the above baffles me... because truly, the US really does have many, many good things to take credit for - so, why steal it?Anyway, the above was not meant as an aside - it's relevant to the review - because it underlies the basic facets of this movie - where the Brits are made to look both incompetent and dimwitted by our US brethren (that implies a brotherhood that at least one of us no longer feels.).",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
265,ramonster_uk,The Kingsman - a shadow of its former self in every way,5,21 September 2017,"The first movie is a favourite of mine (gave is 8/10), so going into this I had high hopes. Sadly the movie lacked the inspiration, heart and comedy of the first outing. Here we have a movie more concerned with cameos (Elton John one was far too drawn out, guy just looked creepy), cheap F-bomb laughs and ""American as apple pie"" clichés. The whole drugs message too was just stupid and poorly delivered. Now for the main villain..... Julianne Moore is a great actress, however here she wasn't the best choice and just didn't seem to gel with the movie. No real back story, no gravitas in her delivery and her final scenes were unbelievably anticlimactic. Don't want to knock this one too much, but it could have been so much better! It is like they just didn't know how to make a sequel, yet pushed one out anyway to cash in quick.

Giving us (unlike many other ultra rushed) a well paced eye candy; entertaining content with just enough action and nice dose of humor. Some would add British, but not exactly I guess, as this generalization changes lately. Included are even several kinder eggs for those who can recognize them. There are some soft spots; but being primary entertainment movie meant for child in us, this is funny, not-too-complex, gadget-full story (including ironically approached global and contemporary issues like new technologies, politics on drugs and terrorism).

It is so ham fisted in your face in this film that you just want to die. Basically, Trump is an evil man who wants to kill all the druggies so that no more drugs will be distributed.

268,rs403404,"All hail the second ""Kingsman"" movie",8,3 October 2017,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" was a story designed to bring back the days of not so serious spy movies...think James Bond movies before Daniel Craig. Sure, they could be serious and dramatic but there was still this sense of fun that was inescapable: villains with insane plans who control henchmen with superpowers. The hero gets the bad guys (and girls) in style then ultimately saves the day. In many ways, it was a success. ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" was reminiscent of such Bond films like ""Goldfinger"". Both are very good movies with real emotion and stakes, and plenty of cringe- worthy moments.Therefore, if The Secret Service can roughly be equated with the strongest Sean Connery James Bond movie, then The Golden Circle parallels a stronger Roger Moore Bond film. Sure, it's plenty of fun and not nearly as cringe-worthy, but it also feels more hollow. Consequently, events have less emotional impact on the heroes and, additionally, occur not to progress the story but to establish a cool scene.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" picks up from the previous film as we are reintroduced to Eggsy (the brash youth who became a Kingsman as played by Taron Egerton). He is quickly attacked and we are brought into one of the film's faux one shot fight scenes. It's filled with computer animation leaving me unsure if I should be impressed at all by the technicals of the shots or just looking at cleverly integrated CGI and real life. Either way it's impressive, though the speed comes dangerously close to headache inducing.His attacker works for Poppy (Julianne Moore) who is the biggest drug dealer on the planet. Her sinister plan? To legalize all drugs in the United States. I guess the idea is to replicate the villain from the first movie, but it doesn't quite work. Valentine's plan was to fix global warming by killing almost everyone. He's trying to fix a problem by creating a much bigger problem. Here, Poppy poisoned her drugs and will only cure the afflicted if drugs are legalized. Valentine's endgame is unacceptable. Poppy is doing plenty of bad things, but her endgame potentially acceptable or, at least ambiguous.This is just another example of how this movie copies from the original but loses quite a bit in translation. Matthew Vaughn has directed many other comic book adaptations, but seemed to always end up out on the sequel. He consistently does a great job so it is an inexplicable shame to lose him for the follow through. So, now he has a sequel to one of his own films under his belt and he manages to do well, while he simultaneously disappoints. ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is easily Vaughn's worst movie. Fortunately for him, even his worst movie is still plenty fun.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

270,darryl-42069,"Enjoyable, but lost the charm of the original",7,23 September 2017,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the surprise hit of 2015. It's unexpectedly good, with great humor, acting, action, and chemistry with other actors. So when director Matthew Vaughn decides to do a follow-up, I was pretty excited to see Eggsy and co. kicking ass once again. Being dubbed as a ""proper"" spy movie, the movie has since build a lot of excitement, but does it lived up to the hype?The answer, is a simple no.Kingsman: The Golden Circle is indeed enjoyable, but it has plenty of flaws that makes the movie fail to deliver it's promise as a ""proper"" spy movie.To start, everyone did very well in delivering their roles. Taron Egerton once again stole women's hearts as the likable Eggsy. Colin Firth returns as Harry Hart and his reintroduction is actually made sense imo, and he did a great job portraying him. Mark Strong did a great job as Merlin. Hally Berry, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Pedro Pascal also did a great job, though I'll admit that Channing Tatum's character is just a simple plot device. Julianne Moore as Poppy, though not menacing, also did a very good job. The biggest surprise is Elton John. He's the ""Joker"" in the movie, and he did very well.The action scenes were over-the-top, sometimes idiotic, but very enjoyable, though this brings to one of my cons. The cinematography is fantastic it's very well shot, though the action scenes has plenty of angle cuts, and the editing was also great.But, as stated before, the flaws in the movie makes the movie fail to meet our expectations. Most of this is because the terrible marketing campaign, that reveals some of the twists and turns of the movie that should have worked (even Matthew Vaughn agrees). The CGI is mostly used to blend several cuts into seemingly one single shot, and despite it actually worked in the first movie, it failed here because the transition is so noticeable. The action scenes were also over- stylized, featuring more slow-fast- zoom camera-work that again, worked on the first, but failed here because it's overused. There's also a sex scene that I felt out of place, and it's most likely brings a lot of controversy. A character (nope, not Tatum's) in this movie is also very bad in terms of her character because it serves nothing but motivation for Eggsy to save the world again, and the worst part, is that this character is not even a important character in the first movie, but she has more screen time than some of the main characters from the first movie and even the new characters as well.(SPOILER ALERT. not really, but if you think it was, there you go) Also, the movie takes a unnecessary and questionable move by killing not one, but TWO main characters from the first movie (three, if you include another memorable thing from the first movie), in which one felt very unnecessary, and the other felt like the character has to die.Overall, the movie is entertaining, indeed. But the movie lost it's charm, and just nowhere near as good as the first one. For casual moviegoers, this is an enjoyable movie, but for a Kingsman fan like me, it's disappointing.Final Score: 7/10",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
271,darcywinchester,A lacklustre sequel,3,14 December 2017,"In this Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass, Snatch) directed film, also written by him, Jane Goldman (Stardust, Kick Ass), Mark Millar (comic book 'The Secret Service) and Dave Gibbons (comic book 'The Secret Service), Taron Egerton (Eddie the Eagle, Sing) once more stars as Eggsy (A.K.A. Galahad) who must work with Merlin (Mark Strong: Stardust, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) when the Kingsman HQ is blown up to find out who is responsible. 
The movie starts by Eggsy being approached by rogue Kingsman recruit Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft: Vampire Academy, TVs Gunpowder) who tries to kill him using his mechanical arm whilst in a moving car. Merlin helps him to escape and Eggsy makes his way to his friend Brandon's (Calvin Demba: Rue Boy, London Road) birthday. Also there are his other friends Liam (Thomas Turgoose: This is England, Eden Lake), Jamal (Tobe Bakare: TVs Death in Paradise and The Tunnel) and Eggsy's girlfriend Princess Tilde (Hanna Alström: A Place in the Sun, Kingsmen: The Secret Service). He asks them if they can look after his dog JB while he meets her parents.
In London, Eggsy and Lancelot (Roxy: Sophie Cookson: The Huntsman: Winter's War, The Crucifixion) meet the new the Arthur (Michael Gambon: The King's Speech, Gosford Park). 
While Eggsy is meeting Tilde's parents (Björn Granath: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Evil and Lena Endre: The Master, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), both his home and the Kingsman HQ are destroyed killing all inside. Finding that Merlin has survived they travel to Kentucky, America (as per Kingsman protocol) where they meet Agent Tequila (Channing Tatum: Logan Lucky, Step Up), Ginger Ale (Halle Berry: Monster's Ball, Gothika) and Whiskey (Pedro Pascal: The Great Wall, TVs Game of Thrones) at the Kingsman distillery, where they find they have been keeping amnaesiac Harry Hart (Colin Firth: The King's Speech, Love Actually) since his encounter with Valentine. Head Statesman Champagne/Champ (Jeff Bridges: True Grit, The Big Lebowski) tells them they must find out what Charlie Hesketh knows and to do that, they must travel to Glastonbury music Festival to find out what his ex-girlfriend Clara (Poppy Delvigne: Elvis & Nixon, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) knows of his whereabouts.
The new enemy is the 'Golden Circle' led by American drugs billionaire Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore: Still Alice, The Kids are All Right) who is keeping Elton John hostage in her rural jungle in Cambodia which she has named Poppy Land. Will the agents get to her and the antidote for her lethal drug in time?
The film also stars Bruce Greenwood (Star Trek, I, Robot) as the President of the United States and Emily Watson (The Book Thief, Red Dragon) as his Chief of Staff Fox and Mark Arnold (Blade Runner, Florence Foster Jenkins) as General McCoy
Having loved the original, this is a poor sequel. A lacklustre script with predictability in the characters and storyline (what there was of it), plus a villain who did not seem to have a reason to oppose the hero. With juvenile humour and sexism on another level to the first film, the Glastonbury 'storyline' stooped to beyond offensive to women (I suspect most audiences forgave the original Tilde one because the rest of the movie was so great) and far too many f-words from Elton John, who though a very talented singer, cannot act, the film is a huge let down. 
Firth, Egerton and Strong do their best with the woeful material, as do Bridges, Berry and Pascal (seriously, why would anyone not give Berry something to do unless it's because she plays a female character?) yet none of them were given a chance, no wonder Firth spent the movie looking like he wished he wasn't there. I suspect the rest of them felt the same.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

The first film was flash but not too flash- walking that tightrope of fabulous to solid plot but remaining coherent with characters we could really dig.Not this film. This film falls off the tight rope and right into the sun.Don't get me started on all of the character development that doesn't happen, blatant inconsistencies and just plain WTF? of this lazy, lazy script.I wont do more than mention the overdose of swaggering Americana- and I do mean Over Dose. (All of the US agents come off as hackneyed fools- except Halle Berry, and the whole movie you're thinking, ""when will Halle get to DO something? Why the heck is she even IN this movie?"")I wont do more than say that Colin Frith just looked extremely annoyed the whole movie, like he'd rather be anywhere else - and you can tell why. None of the actors were used to their potential. None. (For that matter neither was the story line.)The action sequences were not even that great, more cobbled together and repetitive, and the one or two good scenes couldn't make me stop just WISHING IT WOULD JUST END.

Well, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is here to rescue your tired brain with the assurance that while your mind slowly numbs itself to sleep watching it, it will watch over you and keep your brain safe from interesting plots, or characters, or novel action or anything that might tax your brain.Its ironic that the protagonist in the movie chides another character for being driven solely by desire to make more money than any soulful reason, since that is exactly what has driven the makers of this sequel.The opening action sequence of the movie is the only part of the movie that was good, and what one would expect in style and quality to connect this sequel to the original. The movie just went downhill from there and rapidly. There is a thin line between being roguishly charming and being rude. The first movie seemed to handle this reasonably well, this sequel does not.The movie does have a budget of 100M, so there is some value to the production and the hackneyed fight scenes, which is pretty much the only redeeming quality of the movie.In the first movie, the Kingsman were professional operatives. The Robin Hood legend of rewarding the poor yeomen and sticking it to the arrogant aristocrats made sense in the context of England. In the sequel, the Kingsman are like British football hooligans, they are patently arrogant, supercilious and insulting and beat up foreigners in foreign countries and seem to be drinking frequently for no apparently justifiable reason.

274,jamiecfc1,Not as good as it could be,6,27 October 2017,"I watched the first film in this ""series"" (presuming it will be a series) and thought it had potential, despite Taron Egerton, who I think is a pretty terrible lead character. Presumably he's there to appeal to the younger audience who call each other ""bruv"" and ""man"". Aside from which he's pretty wooden as well. I digress. The plot is pretty good, and some of the other actors do well despite the script which seems to revolve around inserting ""f*ck"" every other line, which gets really irritating and is sadly a trademark of both Matthew Vaughan and Jane Goldman. The only time it has any value is with Elton John's cameo moments, which are very funny especially as he really plays up to his ""diva"" reputation.

275,gonzallanca,Entertaining,6,10 October 2017,"What I found most important in the movie is a SPOILER, so have an eye.After defeating Valentine, the Kingsman will meet a villain (Julianne Moore) more insane than Valentine himself. So insane that it ends with Kingsman, thanks to a few missiles. Eggsy (Taron Egerton), Melin (Mark Strong) are the only remaining Kingsman. As a result, Kingsman's counterpart in U.S.A will have to go to the Statesman. Led by Champ (Jeff Bridges). With the help of Statesman they will have to defeat Poppy, and save the world.Let's start with the actors. Taron Egerton liked me at first, and I still like it here. A very good choice of cast. After seeing him in Eddie the Eagle I love this actor. The best of cinema today. Mark Strong is an actor who hardly ever mentions these opinions. But it is a very good but very good. It does not have very protagonist papers, but when it has its moment it will surprise them all. Colin Firth this guy won a (prohibited word) Oscar, which we can say he is a great ... Julianne Moore as Poppy I thought a strange character, because that should be, and very but too cartoons. But he has a very good interpretation.""Why did you put a 7, and you talk so good about the movie ?!"" For this...The villain, Poppy. Besides, of the aforementioned, of the caricature that is, also the plan of the villain seemed very spontaneous. Very fast. Very ""This is my plan and I am very evil because I am crazy"" It did not make much sense. And finally you realize that the plan did not make much sense.Colin Firth ... He made it excellent. But as I revive the character I found it rather strange ... Not forced, but rare. With a balloon placed on his head and saved. Without having previously lost memory. Weird, no?The action scenes are always enjoyable and so funny because of their violence.The script, but by the end, is very predictable. We know that Whiskey is the bad spy. It is known for the first time that appears.Find out that they abused CGI much more than in the first movie. And talking about the first movie. Matthew Vaughn is an excellent director. One of my favorites (But no one beats Nolan). And in this movie shows its full potential.The death of Merlin. I thought it was ridiculous, because he sings before he dies. I could have done something other than die. Probably live like someone else with us ...The president of the U.S.A. is a complete (prohibited word) ""Let's say what Poppy says"" IDIOTA.But, the film fulfills its purpose ... to entertain.Entertaining 7/10And the best of the movie ...

278,Danielpotato,"Generic, Boring, Fake action spy movie.",1,21 September 2017,"What a bad movie, we have here. Everything about this movie sounds false, the cinematography is completely saturated, which at the beginning of the film, all the action sequences look like false and consequently all the excitement and adrenaline goes down the drain. I say sewers. Sorry. After all, the main character at the beginning of the movie will stop at the sewers to go to see his girlfriend. Yes, that's where this movie belongs.In other words, an annoying and boring action movie, we have here. Because of that, the film changes from set piece to set piece, yet the scenes are poorly structured, the scenes are saturated, with the pace to be slow as a turtle, which makes the scenes that should be fun to see, in empty action scenes without any impact, example each punch that a character gives to another character does not have any impact, so does not have emotion or excitement.Not only that, as the characters have such exaggerated action scenes, these action scenes make the action sequences of the superheroes films tiny in comparison. Remember, they are not beings with superpowers, but simple humans. The feeling of danger or death ends up completely disappearing. And in the end, we end up not caring about the fate of the characters which are in the movie itself. Or better, the characters who had nothing interesting to connect with the audience since the beginning of the film. The characters are generics and poorly executed and written.If an action movie, can not produce good sequences of action, for what purpose this movie exists, anyway? This movie also does not convince anyone as a spy movie because the film is not serious enough and as a comedy movie, the elements of comedy are too bad to laugh, that is, the film still fails because the movie itself has no definite tone, so, is this a action movie? a comedy or a traditional spy movie? Apparently nobody knows, not even the filmmakers themselves.Not to mention, the acting sucks too. Halle berry, should have stopped acting since the last 10 years. Julianne Moore, why are you here? You also do not convince anyone in an action movie. Stay in your dramas. I do not remember, the acting of the other actors. This movie so passable and generic. A film to avoid totally, to speak the truth.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
279,MovieSoup,This film is pandering nonsense. The first was better,3,24 September 2017,"Kingsman golden circle is a hot steaming pile of pandering nonsense. The plot is all over the place, characters are stilted whilst others are not utilised properly. The music is terrible, the camera work passable and the whole feel of this movie is BLEH. A far cry from the first one and has none of the charm or wit. The plot revolves around this woman who wants to make drugs that kill people and bribes the president with an antidote in return for fame. The president is an evil man who gets impeached and replaced with a ""strong, truthful"" woman who is his vice president (VP). This is strongly prevalent during the film and is obviously a poor analogy for the Donald Trump situation at the moment. The fact that the VP looks like Hillary Clinton as well is majorly pandering to the audience and this part of the plot is so rammed down our gobs that we choke on this pretentiousness. It adds nothing to the movie and is just a sad attempt at getting political in what was meant to be a goofy, fun spy movie.The rest of the plot is disjointed at best with Colin Firths character getting a downturn. In the first film he was a master spy with great reflexes and a charm that left us all rooting for him. In this film he is such a wimp that he needs help from Elton John (of all people!!?) to kill a robot dog. Even his ""manners maketh man"" scene is done again for no reason. In the first that fight made sense and had a point to the plot. In this the fight happens for no reason other than the studio wanted to rehash it. The villain in this film is poor as she has no real personality and is so dull. She also spends all of her time in a 50s diner and never leaves. Not even when she knows the Kingsmen are coming for her does she run out or try to escape. She is so removed from valentine who was a great goofy villain. In fact she is so boring that I even forget what she is called and I saw the movie 1 hour ago.That is how forgettable she is!The Swedish woman, who was barely in the first film, is very prevalent in this one for some reason?? I thought she was just in the first one for comic relief and so Eggsy could fuc* her in the a*s. I don't know why they killed off Lancelot (Roxy) and kept the Swedish woman in the film. Roxy was very prevalent in the first one and she gets killed off in this for no real reason and it's such a lacklustre, boring death as well that leads me to believe that she wasn't really important in the first film after all. The statesmen are a really stupid idea. They all have southern accents and wear denim jackets and cowboy hats. I don't know if the writers have actually been to the US but that is not how all Americans act and dress. You don't see the Kingsmen pandering to English stereotypes like drinking Tea all the time and having fish and chips. So why then do we get this from the statesmen? It seems too stereotypical and just a dumb thing to throw into a plot.Channing Tatum got a huge portion of trailer time however he is hardly in the film at all. He has one 30 second fight scene and that's it. I think he was just put in so women who get wet at Channing Tatum and will go see it. Sorry girls but he ain't in it.but the sexy Mexican guy from Narcos is..Not Pablo Escobar! the other one.To cap it all off the technical parts are terrible, especially the music. First that dam ""country road"" song by John Denver plays in this film which is becoming a standard for films in 2017. It was used in Alien Covenant AND Logan Lucky AS WELL AS this film. Maybe that's a mark if a film is sh*t now. If country road is playing you know the film is garbage! All the action scenes for the last half of the movie have country songs in the background which just takes away so much from the scenes that you feel bored watching them. The good stuff is few and far between. The taxi chase at the start is great and sets the movie off well and the camera angles and shots are competent. Mark Strong is okay and is trying his best with what he is given. The comedy is okay in bits but is let down by all the rubbish and painfully unfunny Elton John scenes which kill the comedy dead. All in all this has been a rubbish sequel to a great first movie. I liked the first one and was going to give this one a chance however so many things fell short. The characters were boring and in Harry's case were turned into wimps. The Statesmen where caricatures of what people think Americans look and act like and to cap it all off the political pandering this film does if just so BLEH!I hate Donald Trump as much as everyone but having an analogy in a fun spy movie about his politics is completely boring and takes the heart away from this film series. The main thing this film is missing is the fun and goofiness the first had and it is just sad to watch if I'm honest.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

281,Safcinexile,Decent enough action film but lacking punch from it's original.,7,20 September 2017,"Firstly let me say, you know what you going in to see so don't expect any Oscar performances but still decent enough sequel, although I think they must have decided to play it safe and toned down the violence and swearing that made it's predecessor successful. The cast knew what they were doing and appeared to play everything tongue in cheek, rather than take it too seriously by the looks of things, which probably made it more enjoyable to watch. A few laugh out loud moments, especially from, surprisingly, Elton John's kick-arse scene and a scene involving a heart racing snow lift escape, agents in distress and an elderly gentleman's bowel movement!My main plus was Julianne Moore, she probably was surprise package of the movie, for me her role as the protagonist was perfect, not as over the top as Samuel L Jackson, more understated and less in your face, which for me worked better. Shame her death was a bit anti-climatic.Story itself was by the numbers and there were a couple of plot holes and ending predictable but if you switch off your brain and just enjoy the movie for what it is, then it's worth watching.Will be nice to if we get to see more of The Statesmen if they decide to make another film (which is more than likely) hope Matthew Vaughan would behind the scenes again if they do and possibly improve some this sequel flaws.Manners.. maketh... man",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
282,gangstah_vino,Beautifully shot action sprinkled with some disappointments,8,21 September 2017,"First of all, if you like going to the movies with reviews on your mind.. please read them instead of just taking the score into mind. The action is amazing, original, well-shot and thrilling! It gives you the same adrenaline kick as in the first film. I will warn you though.. there is no scene that is on par with the church scenes. don't expect a 4 minute slaughter of another church, because it simply isn't there! It is asking a lot though from this franchise, so i didn't mind. 10/10 for the action. Characters.. Well this is hard. Eggsy is great. Agent Whiskey is so good in this film. He caries like 3 of the best action scenes. He was SO American. Poppy a.k.a. julian moore's character fell like she overdid it. Channing tatum's character was barely in it, which was disappointing because he had an awesome action-setup and then he vanished. I can't talk about the rest of the characters, but agent whiskey, along with halle berry's character, eggsy and of course.. the OG galahad were great. Some characters got rid off and it didn't have to. 8/10Cinematography: in times to cgi-ish, but overall fantastic. 9/10Story: The story itself is great. the screenplay however disappointed me. Moments where i needed to feel it weren't there. The story in the first one is about eggsy. this one is as well, but i needed more emotional moments to really adore him again. we did something else though that was very endearing.

284,JasonR77,Amusing Sequel,7,11 December 2017,"Duplicating the success of a bizarre action comedy like the original Kingsman was always going to be hard. Raising the stakes on the evil plan was nearly impossible, and packing that same level of fun was never going to get there on the same level, as you risk duplicating jokes.All that aside, it's a fun movie, though it suffers from its predecessor's downfall by being about twenty minutes longer than it needs to be. Trim a little bit and you come out with a more compact film that still gets the job done.The plot line is reasonable, and Julianne Moore gives a performance that reminds me of Samuel L. Jackson in the first film, up to and including their love of burgers. Though the first scene in the diner is disturbingly funny, it seems to have minimal effect on the remainder of the plot.This is the part where I have to discuss Elton John's role in the film, which is truly spectacular. He curses, he's funny, and he kicks ass. I don't know whose idea it was to bring him on board, but particularly for a non-actor, he steals his scenes every time.The fight scenes are much like the first one; oddball music choices set to bullet-time heavy sequences. This time, the final fight doesn't feel like it drags on forever, but as aforementioned, the stakes are not there, so it almost works against itself.Ultimately, though, the movie is fun, funny, disturbing, and worth taking a look at.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
285,TyJustice,Forgettable sequel misses out on what made the first movie great.,4,4 February 2018,"In comparison to the first film, Kingsman: The Golden Circle comes off as a poorly written fan parody. It tried to be a fun, mindless action romp but it had problems pulling that off with any sort of esteem. The direction lacks any sort of vision or character, and the writing is hardly believable or inviting. The characters we fell in love with from the first one because of their wit, intelligence or combat prowess are underused in this iteration of the story and replaced with boisterous, unlikable ""Statesmen"" and while their specific individual sets of skills and practice might be one of the only redeeming qualities this film has to offer, we see very little of these fascinating characteristics explored and rather than give us would we as an audience would like to see much of the film's action takes place in silly, tongue in cheek sequences that don't take itself seriously in places that would have served the plot nicely with some depth or nuance.While as of early 2018 when this is review is being written not much as been said about the possibility of a third Kingsman film being made, but hopefully if they decide in favor of a complete trilogy the next one will learn from the missteps in this installment and return to what made the first one so electric, gripping and fun. If you were a fan of the first Kingsman, skipping this one won't hurt.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
286,tom-43722,"Crazy, over-the-top and fun",7,30 September 2017,"It's clear that Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal, Elton John and Julianne Moore were all having the time of their lives filming this. The movie's over-the-top style, which did well at capturing the spirit of the first film, allowed them all to have fun with their characters. However, when a more serious scene presented itself, like when Merlin had to sacrifice himself or when Harry revealed that he had felt like he was leaving nothing behind when Valentine shot him in the previous film, they still brought the heart and emotional weight needed to convey what the characters were going through. From a character standpoint, my favourite scene was when Eggsy managed to remind Harry of who he was. That was a very touching scene that brought a smile to my face and showed that, while this film is mostly just meant to be an over-the-top action comedy, it still knew when to tone it down and allow us to appreciate the bonds between the characters.I thought bringing Colin Firth back was a bit risky since Harry got shot in the head in the first film but their explanation for the healing of his head wound, although rushed, was at least brought back again later rather than just shoved into the film for convenience and then abandoned. Too bad it was applied to one of the films villains. What did slightly bother me about Harry's resurrection is how and why Halle Berry's character (by the way, that woman looks damn good for her age) even found and bothered to bring him back in the first place. But overall, it doesn't matter. Colin Firth brought back the dashing Kingsman agent but added a layer of vulnerability to him that we didn't see in the previous film.Julianne Moore, another woman who is aging well, is mostly known for her skills as a dramatic actress but this movie showed that she can also be balls to the wall psychotic. Poppy Adams was a complete psychopath who could do terrible things with a smile on her face and was clearly having tremendous fun being the villain. I also liked the jab they made to corrupt politicians with the scumbag president.Overall, this is a good sequel. Not perfect but clearly the performers were enjoying themselves so it's easy to enjoy it along with them.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Kingsman: The Golden Circle is more of the same and it still delivers. It's fun, crisp and never boring. A well made movie.The link with James Bond is pretty easy, you have your secret (non- government) agency using secret code-named agents with numerous gadgets to save the world from evil-genius villains. The link with the Expendables? Many famous actors pass the revue (Julianne Moore, Colin Firth, Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, Elton John(!), Jeff Bridges) and there is a lot of high paced action.The story is well thought of and each concept (Statesman, Poppy estate, ...) was well setup in how it was presented, how it works and how it all just fits in the story. The music was well-chosen and perfect for each setting.Actors are doing well and the characters fit the story. Cinematography was fine. I was impressed with the cruelty of some scenes that are still light to watch. Cruel, yes, gruesome or horrifying, no.Things I didn't like? Perhaps occasionally it was somewhat over the top (though if you compare with some other movies it's still OK) and I was annoyed that Kingsmen (with all their might) were so dependent on Statesman. It's presented as if Statesman was superior in about everything.The movie is, as an action movie should be. Stylish, fun, a decent storyline and highly entertaining.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
289,realmuthaf,"Worse than the first one, but no by much",7,27 September 2017,"First of all, I'm going to have spoilers galore in this one, so beware.Kingsman: The Golden Circle is quite similar to the original in its vibrant color palette, good action with active camera and long takes, brutality and crude humor. Unlike the first movie, this one does have a pace drop in the middle, but in my view it wasn't too bad. Another difference is that the degree of absurdity has been elevated, and basically all scenes with Elton John are a prime example of that.There are quite a few things in the storyline that I would have done differently, though.First, Roxy is just not done justice - she is basically killed off- screen despite being a prominent character in the original, and is only mentioned like twice afterwards. I thought that this means that she would reappear closer to the end, but unfortunately it was not the case. Next movie, maybe?Second, Merlin was also laid off quite needlessly, even without letting him have a proper fight scene. Could he not just wait in the bushes on the mine for a few hours? They weren't spotted when they stepped on it.Third, Firth's return was a mistake, in my opinion. The first movie boldly broke some stereotypes and killed one of the protagonists and it was memorable. Now all that has been reduced to an implausible resurrection and return to the same stereotypes the first movie managed to break - we have an amnesiac mentor, who at first doesn't remember his old self, but then comes to his senses. You know, like in Men In Black 2, for instance.Among other things: there is no mention of Eggsy's little sister; the entire love line with the Swedish princess is completely useless; the American agents were underused; the new villain is similar to the old one but more boring; Whiskey's endgame motivation was really stupid. Oh, and if you want to implant a tracker into the mucous membrane of a woman, you'd think it would be easier to put the finger with it into her drink rather than her vagina.Sounds like a lot, doesn't it? True, but most of that comes to mind in some time after seeing the movie, while my overall impression upon watching was favorable. It's still a good movie, only without the same freshness the original brought and with some disproportions between the film's elements. I would be interested in a third part, though.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

No original thought here because it's all put out for us to see in the over the top and unbelievable car chases and fighting scene. That make the move more like an action video game. Directors and editors obviously blind to how this destroys the movie unless your 10 years old. Their is a point when action cannot carry a story or movie any further.

Alas, it is two and a half hours of my life wasted. This movie does not match the first one in plot, acting, or interest.

I don't think so. I enjoyed Kingsman: The Golden Circle a lot, although it had so problems as well as the first one.The first movie is arguably the best, and this is basically the same movie. It does almost everything again, but in another way. The first 30 minutes (which was the recruit scene from the first movie), is now a continuing of the first movie.The movie is great, although nothing is perfect. It opens with a stylized action sequence and a car chase throughout the city. After that, we gets introduced to a great cast and characters. Everyone from the first movie, along with Channing Tatum (21 Jump Street), Pedro Pascal (Narcos), Halle Berry (Monster's Ball), Julianne Moore (The Big Lebowski) and even The Dude himself, Jeff Bridges. It even has a cameo from a famous old music artist. I don't want to spoil who it is, but it's Elton John. It's on the DVD Cover. The only problem is that everyone doesn't get enough screen-time.Some of the action scenes in the movie, is overshadowed by the action scenes from the first movie. It's more talking than fighting, and the movie's way too long for that.Besides for that, the movie is great and underappreciated, so check this movie out. But watch the first one first.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
293,tuanskie,Very fun,8,19 December 2017,"It was enjoyable watching this film on Blu-ray after painstakingly trudging through that dreadful Disney made-for-children-TV-show ""SW: The Last Jedi"" (1 star for me, but that's on a separate review). I was lifted by the humor, action, and outright silliness of this sequel. Never mind the haters because it served its purpose - to entertain. While Eggsy was Eggsy (Taron Egerton), shooting out F-bombs in rapid fire, I particularly found the Whiskey character played by Pedro Pascal to be genuinely comical -- he reminds me of a young Burt Reynolds in Smokey and the Bandit -- and perhaps that was the genius of the movie. I think they knocked it out of the ballpark with his lasso-wielding moves and homage to the western cowboy. There was a bit of disappointment with Channing Tatum (Tequila) having a brief acting role -- yet at the end he does appear in England dressed in a Kingsman suit. That likely alludes to him having a bigger role in a third installment. Also, sadly Merlin (Mark Strong) met his demise but did go out with a bang, excuse the pun. But these disappointments were offset by Whiskey and the reprisal of Galahad (senior) by Colin Firth, whose solid acting continues to carry the movie beyond what Eggsy could do alone. In all, it's goofy and fun with less potholes and plotholes than SWTLJ!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
294,Rob-A,"Crazy, Crude, and Hilarious!",7,10 December 2017,"The first Kingsman movie combined Bond with unusual camera action and a shed-load of tongue-in-cheek which appealed to a lot of people - me included. I loved it. This time around, Matt Vaughn (Director) has stolen the script and left the building. then come back with something totally whacked out.. Colin Firth is, happily, back - early on and for the gentlemanly duration. Taron Egerton is his same cheeky, twangy East End self, and Mark Strong does what he always does which is to glue things together. But the real stars in this upside-down, turned-around totally nuts piece of entertainment are Julianne Moore as the completely loony drug-peddler and.. yes. No less than Elton John Himself, making a complete pig's ear of every scene he's in but camping it up as only 'Eejay' can do. This is a Marmite movie. For anyone who doesn't live in the UK - that means you'll love it.. or hate it. It'll really depend on the mood you're in when you sit down to watch it. But watch it, you should. It's not normal Hollywood. It's crude, it's nuts, it's fast-paced, it's funny. It's a lot of things, and fails at most of them but not too badly - except the end-game which is frankly stupid and ridiculous.

295,CraigsCritique,The Golden Missed Opportunity?,6,25 September 2017,"OK I'm just going to lay it out on the table...I thought given all the talent and circumstances involved although Kingsman: The Golden Circle was sporadically fun it was also rather laboured and I'm annoyed that I've come away from it going 'ahh that had so much more potential', it's unquestionably way too long, it takes a lifetime to get going and although all the acting talent are most certainly game I felt the material wasn't substantial or engaging enough.It's well documented that director Matthew Vaughn has always been wary of sequels, he directed both the hugely critically and financially successful Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class yet declined to return for their respected sequels, is there something in this where maybe he thought he would just be repeating the same idea only with less enthusiasm? You know what quite possibly as he finally decided to make a sequel and I think many of his concerns are in play here.Now don't get me wrong when I did laugh I laughed heavily, what's more concerning is that a big portion of these laughs came from Elton John's involvement, the idea of The Statesman in principle is a great further idea in the Kingsman world but were they an absolute necessity to the plot in this film? Think of the two biggest players on that side in Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges and think 'did I get my money's worth?' the answer for me is emphatically no and I just won't have the argument they are building to their larger involvement in another sequel, sorry that just doesn't satisfy me for the reason they were an active ingredient in this film.Here's the thing...the best explanation/comparison I can give is to compare both Guardians of the Galaxy and Kingsman: The Secret Service, the impact of both films were pretty similar, both were surprise box office and critical hits with much of the praise going to the performance of the actors and generally the characters interactions therefore funny scriptwork, whereas yes Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 doesn't particularly move a lot along storywise it did continue to entertain throughout and this is where Kingsman: The Golden Circle falls flat as although yes this is a very serviceable sequel as is generally competently made it doesn't feel like it particularly moves anything along but the main problem is it can't quite keep up the hit rate of entertaining interactions in the process, there's a quite stunning final fight scene with some good satirical political humour in play so there are great positives to shout about but maybe it's just me but I've come out more frustrated with wasted potential for this entry and I really wanted to love it as well but there we go",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
296,jackson-regurge,Tailored for America!,7,23 September 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a fun and action packed sequel delivering on the success of the first film. The film combines British style with American swagger and certainly doesn't pull any punches both updating the spy genre and being a parody of it.The film begins with a brilliant and heart pounding action sequence which immediately sets the tone of the film. The action sequences are very consistent throughout the duration of the movie and with an English action director like Matthew Vaughn I would expect nothing less. Kingsman 2 is very enjoyable and is an excellent film if you just want to sit back and watch an amusing film that doesn't take itself too seriously. However, I would say that the film has been highly Americanised for a mass market. This is a positive and a negative. It is a positive as we get a lot of excellent American/Englishman banter. However, that being, said an aspect of the original film's charm is lost. The acting is in general very good with Taron Egerton returning as Eggsy, once again delivering an assured and confident performance. Old favourites also return to the cast along with a few new members each giving first-rate performances. Julianne Moore stars as a megalomaniac villain called Poppy. The character is a caricature of an archetypal villain but because of the film's light and humorous tone this doesn't matter too much as the movie is just so much fun. Overall, the film is a really entertaining and although it isn't quite as good as the original, it is still definitely a worthy sequel. Kingsman: The Golden Circle incorporates brilliant British humour which is packaged up for American audiences. I would give the film 7 out of 10.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

But after watching it I felt something is missing. Kingsman: The Golden Circle hits you really fast with the entertainment and makes you connect with the main character (a harry Potter type in the spy world) really quickly. However, there are a lot of characters in the movie that are overdeveloped, underdeveloped, or just otherwise unnecessary. I don't understand the character contribute of Colin Firth's Albus Dumbledore. Also Jamie Foxx's character was just got WAY too much screen time. Also, there is a certain scene that kind of contradicts one of the Ron Weasley character's superstitions that felt a bit contrived, stemming from an entire 10 minute aside that the movie could've just done without in my opinion. And finally the END part. The Harry Potter counterpart guy faces his karma. That also made the end very sweet and obvious Bollywood style. I will recommend this movie for its entertainment value, but if you have an eye for quality, except below average and your expectations will be met.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
298,FallonTimberlake2016,"Fun enough, but disappointing overall.",5,26 September 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the highly-anticipated sequel to 2014's Kingsman: The Secret Service, and has a cast that includes Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Taron Egerton, and a whole bunch of other A-listers that wanted some of what the first one had. So does the second Kingsman film match up to the first one? Unfortunately it does not, despite the star power behind it.Honestly, I would describe the plot at this point, but it's so convoluted that I don't feel like going into detail. Basically, there is a drug empire called The Golden Circle and the Kingsman need to stop it. There are so many subplots that at times it is hard to see where the actual plot is going.At a runtime of two hours and twenty-one minutes, it feels like the writers stuffed this film with plot elements, but not all of them are necessary. There is a subplot that involves Eggsy's girlfriend, and every time the movie spent time on it the pacing slowed to a halt. Especially since the actress who plays the girlfriend (the princess from the end of the first movie) is very dry and never entertaining or interesting.If Kingsman: The Golden Circle had spent less time on pointless subplots then it would be a whole lot better of a film. Nearly all of the action scenes are incredible, and in many cases they are right on par with the first film. The majority of the acting also really works, especially Taron Egerton, who should be getting a lot of good non-Kingsman roles in the near future.However, most of these good performances are wasted because they either give good characters no screen time, or major characters no development. Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry are all in this movie for a total of ten minutes, which is a complete waste given how accomplished these actors are. After a while, I started to wonder why they were not credited as cameos, because that's honestly what they were. Julianne Moore was excellent as the drug lord named Poppy, but she isn't really given a character to work with besides just being ""the bad guy."" Special shoutout to Elton John for being awesome in this movie.One character and performance that I really liked was Pedro Pascal as Agent Whiskey. He has always been underrated to me, and here he shows more of his acting chops. They go to a really interesting direction with his character, but then they ruin it about ten minutes after they go in this direction. I won't give anything away, but this is yet again a waste of a good character.Colin Firth is fine here, but the writers came up with a really lazy excuse for his presence in the film. Overall, this was a disappointing film despite having some great action scenes. It should have been about thirty minutes shorter, and they should have completely cut Eggsy's girlfriend from the film. I won't object if a third Kingsman film is announced, but I seriously hope they learn from their mistakes the next time around.I give Kingsman:The Golden Circle a C.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

The plot is well thought out and works very well, especially for a sequel, but s every sequel it never truly lives up to the first, however this is not far from being just as good as the first. The British/American theme works well though and there are some very funny cultural jokes and references. It remains true to everything that made the first film such a success, which is what everyone loved and because of that it made this one such a success and made a large profit at box office, as seen in the first film it included taking big risks and thinking out of the box.

Not only are those well done action scenes disappointing rather than impressive if already expected. It is also sad to realize how very little is going on besides those. There's topics some may claim to deliver a message here, vague and cowardly ambiguous as it is. Thing is: Known topics like drug usage & legalization need to at least hint at depth to convince. The lukewarm appeal this boils down to remains utterly superficial though. The first Kingsman was a really good film. Now it wasn't outright brilliant but it had a stroke of genius here and there, scenes that may inspire and possibly change the uptake on the whole secret agent genre for some of us. It made us laugh, too! This one is nowhere near that. It's boastful meaninglessness goes nowhere, amplified emptiness does not fulfill. Perhaps it is supposed to be a funny uptake on American culture. Perhaps a humorous uptake on English class we saw in the first film is supposed to be replaced by a display of ""western-style ignorance and megalomania"". From where I stand it's neither funny nor insightful. They may have tried to recreate a working recipe and that's not a bad idea. Sadly they went about it woefully uninspired. The best one can say is that they may have attempted for something, but that in itself is not enough. Cooking up some of the old jokes won't do. The characters are as flat and rusty as are those jokes, the action is already known and the ""message"" unconvincing. The whole thing is sadly bland and pointless.

306,imdb-936-837144,Gold Finger-Ring,9,25 September 2017,"(Illegal) drug mogul Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) decimates the British super-spy organization Kingsman and attempts to black­mail the U.S. president with her contaminated world­wide drug supply. A remnant of Kingsman survivors initiate their ""doomsday protocol"" to team up with their American counter­parts the Statesman in Kentucky and retaliate using the latter's ""Arm–ageddon."" The theme of the story—repeated from an earlier episode—is ""Manners maketh man."" The Southern Statesman acknowledge they got their ""manners from the British."" Okay.The development corresponds to a passage of Solomon in the Bible. (Eccl. 9:7) ""Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works."" A flash­back shows Kingsman Eggsy, a.k.a. Galahad, (Taron Egerton) being taught table manners. He is told that he doesn't have to wait for every­one at the table to be served before starting: ""Unless you're eating a cold meal or dining with royalty, other­wise tuck right in."" He proves the exception when dining with his blonde Swedish girl­friend Tilde (Hanna Alstrom) and her sharp-eyed folks.Wine may help a person relax after work, or perhaps something stronger. The president's war on drugs snares such innocents as well as the abusers.(Eccl. 9:8) ""Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment."" Both the good guys and the bad guys are well-dressed throughout. The Kingsman cover is a tailor shop est. 1849. Poppy has a salon.They all use pleasant personal touches, as well: an artificial arm, and eye patch, and medicine to reduce unsightly blue veining of the face.(Eccl. 9:9) ""Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life:  for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labor."" Eggsy has qualms about using his (spy) labor to be a 'sparrow' trading sexual favors for espionage advantage. He'd prefer to wait for a marital commitment to his girl and go that route exclusively.(Eccl. 9:10) ""Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor know­ledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest."" Here's where the movie shines with some humdingers of fight scenes, including ones where they are pitted against double agents, and one where an agent about to meet his demise breaks out into song.I'm reminded of an obscure Civil War battle here in Oregon. The two sides lined up on opposite sides of the street and threw rocks at each other. The technology in ""Kingsman"" is more high tech. They throw bowling balls.This movie abounds in spy genre spoofs. For example, there's the guard dog with a vicious bark, to say nothing of its bite, that gets gold-plated like the babe in ""Gold­finger"". It looks real fine but can't do nothing. I suppose one might say, you can't have your bite and plate it too. It's like those fine Civil War memorial statues that are getting pulled down these days, resulting in ""rock"" fights by opposing sides in the street. You can either memorialize a war that's finished (and decided) or else pick up the battle all over again. Either/or.Paul Darcy Boles in his 1957 novel _Deadline_ (NY: The Macmillan Co.) makes this very point about those who live in the past: ""The rememberers, those who do it in the veins, they are often wrong: they were wrong in the Civil War  but they were wrong with the valiant banner of sticking to their cause, however lost. They're still wrong; but it is a worse wrongness to be one of the new ones, and to still want your cake—every loving bit, he thought—and eat it too, every fabulous crumb; you don't want integration; you just want money"" (53).Of course, outright greed is a major driver of the plot of ""the golden circle."" This movie defies categorization. The plot is too silly to qualify it as a spy-action movie, but the spoofs are too subtle for satire. At times it breaks into song like a musical—""Country Road"", a nostalgic song about W.Va., gets sung twice. All I can say is it was a lot of fun to watch; I enjoyed it way more than I expected to. It boasts a number of accomplished actors in good form. The special effects are believable, though the stunts them­selves are improbable. Were it not so ridiculous, this flick would have received my top score.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
307,rainfollower-95-646324,An average sequel for an outstanding movie,7,27 September 2017,"When you see a sequel you usually can't avoid comparing to its predecessor. In the case of ""Kingsman"" you have a lot to compare to. Cameras, effects, story, drama, characters... Unfortunately, ""Golden Circle"" feels inferior in almost every manner.TL;DR: lack of new and original effects, story, personalities, things to remember; bad self citations. Cool Poppy. 7/10.The first ""Kingsman"" scored 10/10 for me. Eleven out of ten, even. ""Kingsman: Golden Circle"" did not score as good.The story is not as good, first of all. I will not go into details, but the script of ""Golden circle"" contains quite some rabbits pulled out of metaphorical hats. There're too many ""why""-s that come to my mind after the final scene. Minus one point here. Ah! And total lack of drama too, and music doesn't help.The second thing that surprises me is a lack of those cool and funny effects we had in the first movie. Both CG and cameras. And now fight scenes are not exceptionally cool anymore, they're just average cool. We can see such scenes in any AAA action movie. Another point goes here.I have also to take away one point for princess Tilda. What did you do to her, you heartless ba...d people?! Where's that princess Tilda we know?! And this point will also pay for all the boring personalities in the movie. All those people who say their lines and land their blows being totally out of context and meaning, being just a handsome face and and pure functionality, not a real character.And yet one more point for bad self-citations. No, really! You can do such things when you resurrect a franchise that is dead for decades. Like Transformers, or Star Trek, or new approach to Harry Potter... But citing from your own movie three years old?! And how many new scenes do we have for citing in the future sequels now? I'll tell you: zero. I'd even tell this deserves yet another point fee!Now, on the bright side. We have some good political jokes, one really cool camera angle, and Poppy. Who represents the only real thing to remember. This all adds up to one point given back. Only one...So the math is this: 5 points taken away, one given back. Even if we say that initial score was eleven... it is no more than 7 out of 10. And average score for an average AAA-movie, Which is really terrible for a franchise that started as outstanding.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

311,Skaigear,"Interesting ideas, great action and characters, but ultimately betrayed by the script and editing",7,24 September 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is written and directed once again by Matthew Vaughn, who also did the first movie, Kingsman: The Secret Service. I really liked the first film as I found it to be very fun and unique with some spectacular action sequences. While this sequel unfortunately does not quite reach the quality of its predecessor, it nevertheless is still a very entertaining comic book romp. What made the film fell short were a meandering plot and messy pacing which unnecessarily padded the running time to nearly two and a half hours. The Golden Circle introduces so many new characters and subplots only for them to be disappointingly undercooked. The end result is a film that has interesting ideas, great action and characters, but was ultimately betrayed by the script and editing.The film's greatest strength by far is the action sequences. The Golden Circle took the style of the awesome Westboro Church massacre scene from The Secret Service and applies it generously here throughout. The zoom-in, zoom-out and slow-down effects used gave a surreal, visually appealing look to the whole thing. The sequel takes a complete comic book turn with characters now battling with bionic arms that extend and smash through walls, lassos that electrify and slice people in half, robotic guard dogs, as well as the other Kingsman gadgets you know from the first movie. My favorite scene is the opening with two characters fighting in the backseat of a moving vehicle.The acting is very good from all involved. Taron Egerton as the lead really surprised me as he managed to bring a sense of gravitas and weight to a world of complete zaniness. I really liked how unpretentious and down-to-earth his character is while at the same time sweet and loyal. Colin Firth and others also did very well with what they had to work with. The standout of the film goes to Julianne Moore who plays the main villain, is crazy and psychopathic but superficially extremely polite and well-mannered. I love her evil smiles and head- tilts right before she does something heinous.The film presents many new elements, but aforementioned a lot them goes absolutely nowhere. The biggest new component as witnessed in the marketing campaign is the American counterpart to the Kingsman, the Statesman. Without spoiling anything, this secret group is utterly wasted with all the American actors not getting nearly enough to do. Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges did not feel like big Hollywood names performing, but instead zombies sleepwalking to their paychecks. A small role for a famous celebrity was also included in the film that was meant as a surprise to all his fans, but I just found his entire part to be awkward and unfunny and felt it should have been cut. There is a way to do surprise celebrity cameos, but the filmmakers took the wrong approach here. The finale takes place in a diner and feels really small in comparison to the escalation the film was taking. In my opinion, it could have upped the ante a little with a bigger location and the villain putting up more of a fight.Overall Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a very fun and entertaining movie with top-notch performances by Egerton and Moore, but alas was bloated by subplots and poor filmmaking choices. If you like the first movie or James Bond-esque spy thrillers with over-the-top action sequences, you will find much to enjoy in this movie, just remember to leave your brain at the door.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
312,miesnekawalki,Disappointing,3,29 September 2017,"This is not a good movie. The first one was surprisingly fun spoof of spy movies with over the top characters, nice world building and cool action scenes. The sequel sucks though and here's why: 1) Alien2/3/4 syndrome - you establish the characters in one movie (Aliens), you dedicate most of the time to flesh them out and then you kill them at the very beginning of the next movie (Alien 3). Or alternatively, you bring back beloved characters with the power of some goofily explained pseudo science technobabble (Alien 4). There's 3 MAJOR characters biting the dust / being in a coma and 2 characters that are literally brought back from the dead, what... And screw the humans, what did poor JB do to suffer his fate? :( 2) The Villain and The Evil Plan - first movie had an awesome over the top villain with clear plan and interesting character. In this movie the motivation was so lame that I just checked out. Juliane Moore tried her best to match the awesomness of Richmond Valentine, but she just had nothing to work with. Frankly, I'd have more fun seeing her succeed than seeing the movie end like it did. Script and screenplay in this movie is ass 3)) Action Scenes - carefully choreographed fast action scenes from the first movie are replaced by bubbly mangled mess of CGI, seizure inducing camera-work and ultra fast editing. I didn't know what's going on and frankly I didn't care. There's a lot of corpses left behind, bodycount is high but you are totally numb watching it, because it just looks artificial, boring and messy 4) profanity/R rated stuff - don't get me wrong, I love some Scorsese or Tarantino swearfest, I love gore, guts and blood in movies. But it was way too much in this movie even for me. Every second word in any conversation is an F word and I'll tell you a secret - if you use it all the time, it loses its effectivness. I was constantly wondering why does Eggzy suddenly sound like some angry bum, I thought that 'manners maketh man'. Apparently this motto is dated, because the new meta is dropping F bombs every second word that comes out of Kingsman's mouth. Other than that, what was the point of that fingering scene? It's not innovative, disgusting or disturbing, so why is it in the movie? 5) Useless Characters - remember that anal Swedish princess from the first movie? She plays a major role now, why? Halle Berry's character - totally useless. Chaning Tatum - useless. What's the point of those people being in the movie?6) Cameo - imagine a famous musician and his role being dropping about a thousand F bombs (he doesn't say much more than that btw, he just swears a lot). What were they thinking... 7) Flaccid humour - there's a bunch of jokes and stuff, but most of it is just vulgar, lowest common denominator cringeworthy junk.Overall, this movie is just boring, badly made and WAY too long. Disappointing mess. 3/10",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
313,Skeauxsha,Very Disappointing Sequel,2,4 January 2018,"Having watched the first Kingsman film I was all set for another great adventure. Alas it was not to be. The dialogue was chock full of colorful metaphors, every other sentence had F*** or some other juvenile variant in it. 
Eggsy, our everyday lad that only needed a chance, turned out to be nothing but a whining, sniveling little s***.
What's worse the brilliant resilience of The Kingsman organization, is now second class players their American Counterparts ""The Statesmen"" Who were supposed to be even bigger and more omnipotent than the British organization. They weren't. With the two sides committed out of necessity to a Marvel team up, neither could outwit, or foresee the evil plan of an exiled drug lord.
She is supposed to be the apex of the drug under-world, feigning sweetness and charm, and all the while a seething sociopath. The character fell flat.
This film way over-reaches, and is stretched so thin it fails in continuity.
Wait, did I just hear a piece of the X-Men First Class soundtrack being re-used, when the original Galahad regains his memory? O_o Yup, sure did.
Despite the litany of big name stars, Kingsman fails miserably to live up to it's first film.
In summary the makers of this film got lazy, and ruined the amazing chemistry of what should have been another epic Kingsman adventure.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

318,gigitville,"Not the Best, Not the Worst",6,26 February 2018,"So, I really love the first one and was extremely excited for this one. However, there were some moments that fell flat in comparison to the first one. That's definitely not to say that this one wasn't entertaining, silly, fun because it was. There were just some parts that were a little too silly. 
For example, just right off the bat, the partial sex scene. It felt unnecessary and played purely for the shock/entertainment of the audience. It didn't need to happen, even if they had to do that scene ""for the sake of the mission,"" they could've done it in a more tasteful way. Second, the story itself was a little cluttered and the exposition could've been shortened. Also, Merlin didn't have to die. It was definitely unnecessary, they already had a motive to be there and there was already an emotional death with Roxy and JB (which could've been done a bit better.) And Julianne Moore really fell flat. Lastly, the trailers set up a fun almost buddy agent type movie with the Kingsman and Statesman with some arguments here and there, maybe a betrayal, but ultimately working together. Yeah that's been done before, but it would've been better than not really having the Statesman in it that much. I wanted more banter between Merlin and Ginger, bonding over their nerdiness. I wanted to see Taron and Channing's chemistry, I wanted more Jeff Bridges damn it. And on that note, Channing Tatum needed to be in it more. They could've kept his storyline, but maybe had him go with Eggsy to the English music festival and show some witty banter there. 
Don't get me wrong, I really did like this movie. It was a decent sequel, though it was pretty beat for beat the first one, although it wasn't glaring. It was still fun as hell, it had wit and heart, and the performances (aside from Julianne Moore) were all pretty great. I love that Eggsy and the Swedish princess he hooked up with in the first movie were together in this one, because it's not only a great callback to the first one, it doesn't feel forced because Secret Service established Eggsy as a good guy, so getting feelings for Tilde makes sense. And surprisingly enough, Harry's return was done pretty well. Taron did a great job, as well as Mark Strong, and the bits where it was just them together were really great. And the little amount he was in it, Channing Tatum was fantastic. All the Statesman were good actually. Overall, it was an enjoyable and entertaining movie that was a little too silly at some points, but that's sort of what you expect from Kingsman; silly, witty, and entertaining. And it pretty much delivered.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
319,yaseenfawzi,"""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" Review",6,20 September 2021,"""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is the follow-up to ""The Secret Service,"" the film adaptation of the popular Kingsman comic book series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. This new adventure finds the Kingsman headquarters being attacked, forcing its members to re-locate to the American spy organization known as Statesmen. With a long history in common between the two covert services, they must team up to defeat a new, foreboding enemy that will cause great destruction to our world.Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman return as director and co-screenwriter, along with lead actors Taron Egerton as new leader Eggsy, Colin Firth as veteran Hart, and Mark Strong as tech wizard Merlin. Julianne Moore portrays Poppy, the drug cartel villainess of the piece, like that of a Stepford wife, complete with a faux plaza of '50s kitsch. However, her character comes across as generic and her plot to implement toxins on all recreational drugs is nothing short of far-fetched and ridiculous. Channing Tatum is unfortunately wasted in his performance as agent Tequila, while Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges at least make the most of their cameos. An appearance by Elton John, who is being held captive by Poppy, gives the film a slight edge, but soon ends up being repetitive.The action and stunt set pieces are what really drive this movie. Being based on a series of comics, the staging of the scenes has all of the tight-knit structure of still panels being set in motion. The most iconic showcases for this are an opening car chase/fight between Eggsy and the mechanical arm-wearing rejected candidate-turned-rogue agent Charlie, a gondola chase on the slopes of Italy, and the final battle. The non-action pacing, however, feels like it has a start-stop functionality, which makes much of the movie lag in large sections during its unnecessary 141-minute length. Much of the film also gives off a mean-spirited, including a scene where Eggsy has to hide a device in the private parts of his nemesis' girlfriend. At the same time, there is a lot of unnecessary plugging of Fox News, given this is a 20th Century Fox release, which greatly conflicts with the satire of the U. S. President being in cahoots with the drug cartel.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" isn't quite as fresh and exciting as its predecessor, but if you're looking for something that will spice up your movie night, there is enough action and excitement to keep you satisfied.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

But in the action part, Matthew Vaughn is still a master, and the action design and editing rhythm are all over. The whole book is still very comic, but it's pretty good. However, it's not polite for the director to kill people. It's estimated that many people will explode. And why the props fail at the critical moment. The most obvious is Elton John.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

322,fortionat1,One of the worst movies I've seen in years,1,3 February 2018,"I've lost all faith in IMDb's rating system, when a movie like this can be rated in the sixes. It was horrible with little redeeming value other that an occasional cool gadget like a lasso that can cut one in two. From top to bottom the movie was bad, including a ridiculously stupid story line, horrible cliches and god awful music line to go with some of the scenes (like using Take Me Home - I song I like - in the worst way, and that version of Word Up... just awful). I can't necessarily say the acting was bad because the decent actors in the movie could not save this crap of a story and direction. It was just uncomfortable watching Elton John. And to try to get a pro drug and anti-US President theme like its popular was nauseating regardless of what political stance you take.

323,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,Kingsman: The Frantic Sequel,6,21 September 2017,"Why did the first movie work? It worked because THAT movie was conceptualized and executed as a parody to all spy films that came before it, surprising us by juxtaposing the irreverence in the plot with actual character moments that served the gravitas required to bring the entourage to life. In this second outing, the frenetic nature of the action remains intact, but in fleshing out it's own universe, the movie gives up its predecessor's singular ability to poke fun of the quintessential spy film; sacrificing the meta nature of the plot and resorting to a random nature of plot progression. Comparisons with the original momentarily put to rest, The Golden Circle is a wild wild ride with interesting(if underused)new characters and creative(if messy)action set pieces. It's fast paced with amusing dialogue interspersed whenever our titular characters are not landing blows at each other.We waste no time in catching up with Eggsy and the story gets going right off the bat. Over the next couple of hours we're treated to some interesting cameos by top billed actors, with barely veiled call backs to the best parts of the original. For better or worse, it is in these moments of nostalgia that the The Golden Circle is at it's best. Taron Egorton and Colin Firth put in fine performances continuing their characters' interplay from the first movie. For all the things it does right, it ultimately misses the mark. The wayward plot lends to an incoherence that betrays any suspense, and the bursts of gleeful abandon do so at the expense of having any real stakes whatsoever. The bombastic music that accompanies every action sequence plays fervently and frequently enough until it devolves into an overbearing mess. Where Samuel Jackson's Valentine was a great tongue-in-cheek villain, Julian Moore's Poppy is campy and bizarre at best. To conclude, Kingsman The Golden Circle is a fun riot with the simple fault of becoming the very movie that the original attempted to parody. Wild and loud enough to hold your interest but not nearly nuanced and nimble enough for you to care.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

328,Obi_Bamm_Karaoke,Good Follow-Up To A Great Film,8,29 September 2017,"Fifty-five percent on Rotten Tomatoes seems a bit off to me when it comes to ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"". I can see the standpoint of this sequel to ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" setting the bar as high as it did three years ago to the point where what followed it would not be able to measure up. However, the flaw to that logic is that the first film was one of those out-of-nowhere hits that just took the world by storm and this one brings the audience back to the characters that are established with some new ones as well.With Matthew Vaughn back in the directing and co-writing chair (Jane Goldman returns here as well), our story takes place one year after the first film ends, with Eggsy (Taron Egerton) well-established as a Kingsman code named ""Galahad,"" living in the former residence of his mentor, Harry Hart (Collin Firth) and trying to balance both constantly saving the world from evil and keeping up with his girlfriend, Princess Tilde (Hanna Alstrom). When a global drug dealer named Poppy (Julianne Moore) makes a move towards global domination, Galahad and Merlin (Mark Strong) must find and enlist the help of their American counterparts, known as the Statesman. Hidden in a bourbon distillery in Kentucky, they meet up with agents Ginger Ale (Halle Berry), Tequila (Channing Tatum), Champagne (Jeff Bridges), and Whiskey (""Narcos"" star Pedro Pascal) in order to once again save the world and maybe even meet up with an old friend who may or may not know who and what they are.For people that find the classic James Bond films to be a little dated and the Austin Powers films to be way to hokey, Vaughn does his best to bring those fans back into the over-the-top spy genre fans back into the fold. One of the things that I love most about both ""The Secret Service"" and ""The Golden Circle"" is that they require such a suspension of disbelief that they both seem to work on every level, giving me that sense of awe and wonder with the right balance of humor to keep the story moving. I did find the second installment to not be as well- paced as its predecessor, having me feel all of its two hour and twenty minute run time, but that did not keep me from enjoying my time in the theater. The difference with ""The Golden Circle"" is in a story that is more complex than ""The Secret Service"". There are a lot of things going on here, especially with a few twists and turns, and that can (and does) weigh down a film like this quite a bit. Again though, it didn't make me enjoy it any less and it still does not justify the level of reviews that I am seeing online about it. And even the over-the-top violence effects from the first are toned down here, and that didn't bother me either. At a certain point, we as critics have to stop expecting everything to be a cinematic masterpiece that can only be truly enjoyed by the elite whose nostrils haven't pointed towards the ground since the Renaissance and just go ""is this an escape from the chaos that exists outside of this auditorium?"" in order to truly review a film. In the case of ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"" the answer to that question is ""yes, yes, yes"".

Whereas Moore never explored the misogyny of the Bond character, Mathew Vaughn has no problem with it. The first Kingsman film ended on a deeply misogynistic note. This film has it early on.

Just like so many recent Hollywood crapfests, this movie too makes normal, conscious people just want to punch the producers, directors and actors in the face.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
334,crimson-17255,Movie starts off well and then teeters off somewhere in HaHa Land,6,21 September 2017,"I went to watch this movie because a lot of people I know were excited about it and hype can be pretty contagious. Especially if it only costs me about 2 hours of my life. Suffice to say I was disappointed and wondering if the first is better or not (I never had an issue understanding what was going on, the movie was very clear about giving us past information)I suppose the reason I was disappointed was because I didn't know if this movie was trying to be serious about the disaster hitting the world (millions were gonna die because of this drug) or if I should be laughing at the dumb things both the Kingsman and Statesman did. The whole comedy aspect of it was nice on a surface level, but it also made it hard for me to care about individuals. The whole plot was very simple and at times I felt the movie was just being drawn out. Plus, every time we got a new clue the movie would cut to the bad guys side and just give us all the answers. It was kind of like, 'in case you couldn't connect 2 and 2'I wasn't very happy about the portrayal of any of the female cast. Yes we had Halle Berry playing Ginger who was very smart but her role was very minor. Plus she mentions she wishes to be out in the field but is shot down by one of her male coworkers. Then we have Roxy who dies in the first few minutes, and even Eggsy's girlfriend goes and smokes some drugs after thinking she's lost Eggsy. Like girl, you can live without this guy, don't do this to yourself. And of course, our antagonist is this crazy lady. I feel I wouldn't have been turned off by this if it was just the female antagonist but basically all of our ladies were pushed aside or found they were dependant on malesStill, I did really enjoy the only 3 really epic fight scenes of the movie, one of them happening in the first scene of the movie. Another in the middle and then the one at the end. And those British gentleman were very cuteNot a bad movie, but not something I would recommend to someone or buy",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
335,stevenclayalcander,Absolutely brilliant ! Perfect on every aspect !,10,22 September 2017,"When i see the first Kingsman movie, Kingsman : Secret Service, i really love this movie. It really gives you something different, new style of action, with amazing camera angle and slow motion effect. It gives you a new experience with action movies and you will be fascinated with it, trust me ! And with the great success on the first movie, of course it will be made a sequel. Vaughn is given opportunity to be the director of these two movies and i think he is really the one. He makes kingsman the movie that has his own unique style and somehow make it really cool.On different aspect, the story is good just like other action secret agent movie, and with some plot twist added too. Some scene feels emotional, and other scene really hilarious. And with extra touch of same line or same scene in kingsman 1, it just feels nostalgic and sometimes makes me smile. At the end, i was thinking of what it is to be the bad aspect on this movie, but somehow i cant think any of it. Kingsman : Golden Circle is just perfect and really brilliant on every aspect.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
336,nbfcblog,Far from a Perfect Circle....,5,2 October 2017,"Sequelitis"" includes the following:1. Re-hashing plot points and the best parts of the first movie2. Taking the ""bigger and better"" approach with the addition an over-abundance of special effects3. Adding in new characters you don't care about and in worse cases omitting major characters to the detriment to the sequelThe first smash-hit was a good movie because it was essentially an R-rated coked-up riff of those Roger Moore-era James Bond flicks that still boasted a solid story. It was an R-rated ultra-violent Spy Kids!!So going into this follow-up, I thought there was a good chance this sequel would at least match the quality of the first movie given this is the first sequel that Matthew Vaughn has directed (Kick-Ass 2 was directed by Jeff Wadlow and X-men: Days of Future Past was Bryan Singer).Obviously the action never reaches the heights of the Free Bird-soundtracked church sequence from the first (oh boy do they try), but there are a few highlights. The movie opens with a great car chase with Eggsy (Egerton) fighting a Winter Solider-ized Charlie Hesketh (the explanation for how he survived the first movie admittedly makes no sense) soundtracked to Let's Go Crazy by Prince that really starts the movie off with bang!There are also plenty of damn funny moments too, including one involving a GPS tracker that literally had everybody in the audience rolling on the floor.Even though this sequel is far from devoid of entertainment value, it still disappointingly suffers from all three of the ""sequelitis"" issues that I've highlighted above and it is all rooted in the script, which essentially boils down to a re-tread of the first movie with much more fat.Oh boy does this movie have WAY too much fat with it's excessive number of characters and severe pacing issues. For some reason the filmmakers thought it was a good idea to place even more focus on Eggsy, which perplexes the heck out of me because Eggsy has always been the most boring character in this series.Too much of this movie is taken up by his ""relationship-drama"" with his Swedish princess girlfriend (aka. Eggsy butt victory present at the end of the first one) that is played perplexingly straight and only serves to grind the whole affair to a halt. I also love how Eggsy is supposed to have matured since the first movie yet is still somehow dumb enough to leave the door to the secret spy room in his apartment place COMPLETELY UNLOCKED!!!!The dialogue scenes between Galahad and Merlin (Strong) are one of the few times where the movie sincerely succeeds in injecting an emotional core. Probably the most effecting moment in the whole film comes at the end with Mark Strong (if you have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about). It's ironic that for a movie with so much special effects and action, the best scene is a simple one that climaxes with one tiny explosion.The movie in general spends way too much time with superfluous uninteresting elements (Ex. Eggsy girlfriend, a gratuitous running gag with Elton John that over-stays it's welcome) and not enough on the actual interesting elements (Ex. the touching dynamic between Eggsy and Galahad, the satire on drug use that should have been more of the main focus).Even the Statesman, which were a centerpiece in the film's marketing, end up being completely superfluous to the plot. Channing Tatum fans will be severely disappointed because he only has a total of 10 minutes of total screen time before being unceremoniously removed from the plot. Even Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges are barely in the movie and thus do not make much of an impression.The only Statesman to receive any significant screen-time is Pedro Pascal, who plays Jack Daniels (aka. the one with the whip). Now I really like Pascal, especially on Narcos, and he does a good job with the role and has a good chemistry with main trio of Kingsman. But as with the case with most things with this movie, Jack Daniels doesn't really add much to the narrative and mostly exists to squeeze in more action sequences (his last fight scene is a classic case of padding out). He does have an intriguing character reveal but it's frustratingly tacked unto the eleventh hour of the story!!This is a movie in which the filmmakers seemed to have been very much thinking in set- pieces, which isn't always a bad thing (Ex. John Wick, Mad Max: Fury Road) but if that is the route you are gonna take with your action movie.then PLEASE keep the pacing brisk and invention constant!! It is never a good sign when action sequences start coming off as a boring nuisances than thrilling and the nearly two and a-half hour runtime does not help matters.Probably the biggest weakness of this movie is surprisingly it's main villain. Despite a solid introduction (you will not look at a hamburger the same way again), the 50's obsessed drug lord Poppy Adams (Moore) comes off as more of an annoyance to our heroes than an actual threat. She lacks that seamless balance of odd humor and sincere menace that Samuel L. Jackson brought in the first one.Moore's overly ernest dialogue delivery and just the fact that most of the jokes written for her are lame contribute to her character getting annoying and old VERY fast. Moore is a very good actress but her performance was simply terrible!!So at the end of the day, K:TGC ended up just being another average sequel. If you loved that first movie then I can only recommend it as a rental but otherwise, stick with the original.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Did these people watch the same movie that I did?? I guess that is ultimately the power of money and a gargantuan marketing machine. This weak offering falls short on every conceivable level.

Then there's the anti-drug propaganda, at first they appear not to take sides but at the end they let us know where they stood. I am so tired of propaganda in films military, drugs, America, etc...; just stop it will you, it just takes me out of the film when they put that dren in. end of rant. The action while wonderfully over the top is few and far between, and the length of the film didn't help. And there was the reliance on gadgets, although I sort of didn't like it I understood it was part of being over the top. I don't know why they gave Eggsy a romance, it didn't add anything to the movie. And Whiskey looks like a runner up in a Bert Reynolds look alike contest, that took me out of the film. Halle Berry was underused here, she is a better actress than to be just a background character. Julianne Moore is great as a slightly bonkers over the top villain but the character should have had more face time in the film. There were way too many characters, I had a hard time keeping track of who was who and what was happening. Probably could have been a better movie, but it was still enjoyable.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

After watching it, I kind of don't know which genre this movie should be categorized in. The set feels like that of a cowboy movie, but there is Instagram, Twitter and drones carrying objects. When a villain can have lots of secret headquarters ready to dispatch cure, and since era of drones, it is modern day world and I don't see need for villain to hide in a secret jungle. There are sophisticated robots, but nothing sophisticated to monitor her compound - not even a CCTV camera facing outside the walls!!??

342,CuratingAesthetics,"You Pop My Expectations, I'll Pop Yours",6,17 October 2017,"These movies are fun and entertaining, and a nice tongue in cheek ode to James Bond - films that are by no means less absurd. The villains are hilariously ridiculous to the point of over- saturation. They're crazy on the verge of cartoon crazy and Poppy was particularly over the top. Yet it kinda worked since these films don't take themselves seriously. Taron as Eggsy is always charismatic and great at the action scenes. I've seen him in several other films/TV and I really hope he continues to do well. I really liked the first movie. It wasn't perfect, but it was good. There was humor, charm, and that fight scene with Colin Firth is probably one of the best in film ever. With that said, this second movie was a disaster. The film makers tried too hard to recreate things from the first movie instead of letting the second stand on its own. At the end of the day this movie was basically a dramatization about the legalization of drugs using spies. (Side note: The movie definitely made a statement about U.S. politics that was appropriate given the current climate, but nonetheless depressing.) The main issues I had are below. 1) The plot of the movie starts when Charlie gets the Kingsmen information and gives it to Poppy, but the reasoning is never explained. We know he hates them, but she wouldn't have even known about them unless he had told her. She's an American and they're a very secret British government agency. So why did she take on his vendetta so viciously? 2) There is no mention of the events in the first movie. They could have closed it up with a short conversation and moved on. Yet there is nothing about how everyone was going around killing each other or how tons of politicians and celebrities abruptly died.3) We're introduced to a new agency in America, but then learn virtually nothing about them. We know they make alcohol and have very stereotypically American toys that are not as concealable as their British counterparts, but we only ever see one member long enough to characterize them. He ends up being a bad guy and dies. Anyone else we see has no personality, and I'm pretty sure they only got the A-list actors so they could put them on the poster. Why was Channing Tatum even in this? He was frozen the whole time. (I can't stand him, but that's unrelated.) 4) I love Colin Firth as Harry so I understand why they brought him back, but mostly it was pointless. They killed him off in the first movie because it was unexpected. That movie kept stating how it's ""not that kind of movie"", yet clearly now it was, because his death wasn't final. Now anyone can come back from the dead, which means no one's death means anything. They didn't even do anything interesting with his character! The amnesia thing really didn't work for me and it felt like a cop out.5) They took Roxy and Merlin and I was really mad. Roxy didn't even get a chance to be an agent! She got killed right at the beginning of the film! I was so close to yelling obscenities in the theater. I had been looking forward to how her character developed. However, given that Harry came back, maybe these two will show up alive in the next movie in some far-fetched way. 6) They never explained how Harry knew that Whiskey was working against them. He just said he knew, shot him, and then they left it. And I don't care how great your technology is - no one comes back from a bullet wound to the head that quickly. 7) Did we need to have the fingering scene at the music festival? No. I think they were trying to one-up the butt sex scene from the first movie, but even that joke was in poor taste. I think the scene's real purpose was so they could set up a plausible reason for Taron to have his one obligatory shirtless scene. (That part I didn't mind because daaaaaamn he's fit.)8) The first Elton John joke was funny, and maybe the second. Any joke after that was more than was necessary. They overdid it on Elton.9) A royal wedding. Seriously? A royal wedding? That was just stupid. Why did they even have him dating the princess? The film didn't need a love story. It needed a better writer.Overall, not impressed. All I can say is if they make a third installment they better get Tom Hiddleston to be a Kingsmen agent to make up for this terrible sequel.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Come'on now.Fantastic fight scenes and creative camera angles. Love the dark humor. Dinner table scene at 'family' was a favorite. Strong taxi cab start. Kinda dwindled here and there. Why Channing Tatum wasn't given more screen time? He'd have rocked it. I can't stand him for his d-bag roles, but he kind of found an exalted status in here.Loved the integration of back story.

That scene when Kingsmen's all locations destroyed and they promise each other not to cry like b**** & take revenge but then there is fun part and they start drinking beer.

When there is serious scene, Don't ruin it.Everyone in theater started cheering when there is similar scene from first when Harry Hart closes door teaching about respect and starts fighting but here, he fails and they made fun of him. was this necessary? Fans start expecting good actions and exactly at same time movie team adds funny part.Plot was not good. Blue rash appears. victims starts dancing. Using antidote rash disappears instantly.

352,DaMarco-2,"Sequelitis ramps up action, loses charm",6,25 September 2017,"For movie audiences, the original 'Kingsman' came out of nowhere, though fanboys knew and loved the source material. With an excellent leading man in Taron Egerton as Eggsy, and the best mentor one could want in Colin Firth as Harry, who, ironically looks like he could be the former's dad, 'Kingsman' was the surprise hit of 2014. As with 'Men in Black,' 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' and other adaptations of under-the-radar comic books, the film surprised because of its well-formed mythology right out of the gate. And as with the sequels to those other comic adaptions, Kingsman's 2nd outing suffers the problem of bigger, louder, more! The first film was no wallflower with violence, but it certainly had softer moments to create the kind of balance a film needs. Not the case with this movie, which falls into that same pattern of having a villain who wants to destroy the world. Whatever happened to the Lex Luthors who just want to rule Metropolis? Julianne Moore is a hoot as faux-sweet drug lord, Poppy, whose wish is to get her drugs into the hands of all people. In effort to do this, she has poisoned the illegal drug-using world and offers the antidote only if the President of the United States will end the 'war on drugs.' To further her plan and remove all distractions, Poppy has taken out all of the Kingsman except for Egerton's Eggsy and tech guru Merlin, played by the always reliable and charismatic Mark Strong. The two men glean clues to go to the United States to get help.The American portion turns into a bizarre amalgam of everything Europeans seem to know about the rural culture of the United States. When the men realize they must cross the Atlantic, Strong is singing the John Denver song 'Take Me Home, Country Roads,' which is about West Virginia, and then the tune of that song swells with orchestral strains as the two men go to...Kentucky? Well, at least they are neighboring states and do share the Ohio River. But both are Eastern states and so it makes no sense why the American characters are all dressed like they're from Wyoming, wearing cowboy boots, hats, and lariats, and talk with Texas accents. The exteriors all look more like Arizona, with a bar simply named Saloon (???!!!) sitting on a plot of dust, instead being surrounded by Kentucky's famous bluegrass. While the British Kingsman are named after knights, the American Statesman are named after alcohol: Whiskey, Tequila, and Champagne. Wouldn't it have been cooler if they had been named after American legends like Paul Bunyan, John Henry, and Pecos Bill?This movie has no intention to get American geography or lore correct. I have no doubt Hollywood has truncated England's heritage and history countless times, so turnabout is only fair play. It's not offensive, its just discomfiting. It's the equivalent of having a football crazed fan from Nottingham be a huge Manchester United fan while always wearing a City jersey. Once in Kentucky at the whiskey distillery, Eggsy and Merlin stumble upon Channing Tatum, who charms audiences, while he interrogates the two men. They learn Tatum is part of the Statesman, the American cousin of the Kingsman. Then Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry show up to play the head of the group and the techie, respectively, and they reveal that they have Colin Firth's Harry Hart under their care. Take that in. This film has four leading Oscar winning actors in supporting roles! That's the punishment they get for aging past 50!Also strange, Tatum's character becomes ill and is put on ice (it's a fantasy world, remember) and is gone for the rest of the film except for the denouement. The action part is handed over to Pedro Pascal of 'Game of Thrones' and 'Narcos' fame, and he is made up to perfectly resemble Burt Reynolds in 'Smokey and the Bandit,' a reference that seems to only be there for older audiences as it is never called out. Pascal is fine and deserves his credit, but it's obvious Tatum was only brought in for just enough scenes to create the illusion of it being one of his films. If you saw the trailer, you saw practically every scene he's in.To go over the plot from here would be to exhume the body of every movie being made in the 2010s. It gets convoluted and action crazy very fast, and will take our characters around the world. Have you seen a comic book or action movie in the past ten years? Then you have seen the entire third act of this movie. Good guys prevail, bad guys get killed, and all amid a lot of gunplay and bloodshed. Also, and I say this as an American, why does Poppy ask the U.S. President to legalize drugs while she holds the rest of the world hostage? He has no jurisdiction anywhere but the United States and no power to tell other nations what to do. How are the world's leaders omitted from this, except for the fact all the money is going to special effects and high caliber stars rather than a cast playing world leaders?'Kingsman 2' is not a waste of time but it is nowhere as good as the first. And one does wonder if the whole Statesman idea is a way of spinning off another franchise. If so, let's hope someone with greater geographical knowledge of the United States writes the screenplay, which doesn't necessarily mean he or she has to be an American. What the world does need is more Taron Egerton. He's made only one non-animated film between the Kingsman movies and he's the best young actor to come up since, well, Channing Tatum's debut. Put Egerton to work before he wins his Oscar and turns 50 and can't play leads anymore.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
353,dwgmartin-33760,A lacklustre sequel,4,19 December 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle, directed again by Matthew Vaughn and starting Taron Egerton. 
The sequel to the surprise hit that showed off a distinct style and flavour which revitalised the spy genre in 2014 with its over the top fun. This time around the Kingsman have to team up with their American counterparts (The Statesman) to take down an underground drug ring, run by the seemingly innocent 1950s obsessed Poppy (Julianne Moore), who holds the world hostage.Kingsman: The Golden Circle seems to be a studio's head dream sequel it does everything the first does but just bigger... Sadly though this is another case where bigger doesn't translates to better. While doubling the violence, language and sex; The Golden Circle lacks in the sheer creativity of the original, and running in at 2 hours and 20 minutes this sometimes feels like a bloated version of the first Kingsman. With the additional action sequences, you begin to dislike the Kingsman's distinct style especially in the opening which isn't the greatest way to start off your movie- it becomes jarring and kinda giggly. Also there's sequences that drag on for way to long, The Golden Circle could have easily been edited down by 30 minutes by removing some of these scenes.The retuning cast members all do a good job with the material they've been given- especially Mark Strong- but nothing overly special. And, even though this is probably more of a coincidence than anything else, Julianne Moore's Poppy is oddly very similar to the 'villain' in this years ""The Emoji Movie"" (both evil intentions hidden behind a bright happy go lucky personality) - odd comparison but true. And none of The Statesman really stand out, if you liked what you saw of Channing Tatum in the trailer... Well that's all you're getting because he literally does nothing for the movie. Also there's Elton John, he's actually in the movie... More so than Channing Tatum. A lot of Elton John. Die hard Kingsman fans will probably still enjoy The Golden Circle, but those expecting more from this franchise will be disappointed. That being said everything that was in the first is in the sequel which is still good just minus that spark of originality and creativity which ignited back in 2014. I give Kingsman: The Golden Circle a C. Also afterwards John Denver's ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" will be stuck in your head for days, which can either be a good or bad thing really.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

So I was really excited for this movie. And does it live up?Yeah! It's not a masterpiece of any kind but it's a great sequel and actually how I wanted it. It has the same vibe as the original but simultaneity adds new elements to the table. Exactly how a sequel should be done! But how does it hold up to the original?Well, the characters has much more to them in this movie and it does have some emotional scenes. However I did feel the villain was kinda weak. Valetine whilst the way he talked was kinda annoying, actually had some charm. I did not feel like the new one had. Instead it's more of a over-the top villain you find in the James Bond movies. However I think it's better to have main characters with depth and a villain without instead of having the opposite. So they are pretty equal but The Golden Circle is slightly better.Overall I think it's a great movie. If you want a goofy, fun movie with great action and humor I do really recommend it. If you're going into this movie expecting a masterpiece I think you will be somewhat disappointed. But if you're just going into the movie just have some fun, I think you will!8/10",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

357,GreenApplesss,"The movie is good, but not better than the first one.",8,27 November 2017,"The first one made so much attention because it is good, even tho not well advertised. This one I have high hopes that it will be good than the first one, but disappointed. It is still good, but not good as the 1st one. SPOILER: Don't read this if you didn't watch the movie yet. Go to TL;DR part where I review this movie.Channing Tatum didn't good any in the movie, like 'what?'. I was expecting to see him in action, but he was just like an extra in the movie. Just talking, then he got the virus and paralyzed for days. So, I'm guessing that Roxy didn't die cause she saw it coming, she had a time to run. Merlin, Im sure he's dead because in no way you can't survive in a land mine. Im embarrassed that he died in this movie because his character has much image that kept the movie so good. I like Harry came back but I was not expecting that he will act like that. TL;DR The ending is okay, full of action scenes which I like but the CGI is too much which it is getting in the way on those fighting scenes. The first one has CGI action scenes but not as many on this second one. I still like this movie, Worth a watch. If you are hesitating because of getting a bad critic review. Don't listen, Just watch it and you can judge to yourself if it is good or not. For me, This movie is good, but I expect to be better than the first one which I am disappointed because it didn't. The movie deserves where it is right now and I hope, The 3rd one will be better than the first one & second one.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Kingsman 2 in short has the same problems as its predecessor but it also gave me more of what I liked from the first one. It was batsh*t insane which is exactly what I wanted.

364,mdfaraone,"Still Fun, But many Missteps and Missed Opportunities.",7,25 September 2017,"When the original Kingsman:the Secret Service came out it was one of the most surprising ,charming, unique, fun and refreshing movies that year,...an ""out of nowhere"" surprise hit. While this sequel still maintains some of the fun and humor of the first one, much of the charm and goodwill is lost on bad screenplay decisions. Lets talk about what went wrong first: The original spent an entire movie building up this intriguing underground organisation with deep history and roots,processes and tradition, much like the ""John Wick underground universe"" ...and then they WIPE ALL THAT AWAY in the first 15 minutes to make a weak plot device. The Statesman , the U.S. counterpart to the Kingsmen is rather poorly introduced and underutilized and made up of bad American caricatures rather than truly interesting characters, they are supposed to be based in Kentucky yet all sound like Texans. Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum and Halle Berry are completely underutilised and their roles could have been played by ""nobodys"". The original had an almost anti-liberal ,un-""PC"" plot that was very refreshing, this one tries to get too preachy and political which I HATE in movies. The "" bad guys"" in this are really not all that bad and even kind of likable, I could sympathize with the motivations of Poppy, the President and especially ""Whiskey"" Pedro Pascal, who did not deserve his gruesome fate . The action scenes in this instead of being just ""awesome, stylized and over-the-top"" like the original go into ""over CGI-ed, absurd and completely ridiculous"" territory. Too many beloved primary cast members killed off again. What worked: The opening action scene , though too overblown, was a lot of fun. The final action scene with Eggsy And Harry back together again was also a lot of fun, ..and actually Elton John as the comic relief is actually a lot of fun and he shows himself to have some real actual comedic talent and gets more combined screen time than Jeff bridges, Channing Tatum or Halle Berry. Overall there is enough good stuff to warrant a ticket purchase, but it's just a shame that they squandered opportunities to include the Statesman while also erasing too much of the Kingsmen.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

368,abandonsorder,"""Chicken a la Kingsman"" a.k.a ""The Kentucky Fried Kingsman""",8,14 October 2017,"I've perused sundry downbeat reviews of ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"", read the lot, and drearily trudged into the experience of viewing the sequel. Expectations were moderate, poise was relaxed, and bare feet were atop the coffee table. When the movie concluded, I felt my prognosis was shattered. The movie plays to the slow- motion, flip/flop/f*ck-em-up crowd that has kept many franchises afloat, but this brownie seems fully baked to decadence. The ""Dukes of Hazzard meets Get Smart meets The Avengers (the Steed and Peel program)"" vibe is affable now that James Bond has outlived his usefulness. I regret I wield the remorseless temerity to articulate that antipathy for 007, but the incontrovertible reality stands that ""Kingsman"" receives the crown and doesn't spoil the lineage for the British Espionage/Action genre. Bond has nestled into ennui. ""Kingsman"" succeeds with Julianne Moore as the villainess, perhaps conjured from a lost episode of the 1960s Batman TV program (minus the tilted frame). She's a goof, and she, too, is shameless. Channing Tatum's participation is peripheral; however, he proves integral to the future of the franchise. The movie is not quite ""Big and Dumb"" like those ""Mission: Impossible"" movies because it does not have an ego like Tom Cruise tainting the production. Colin Firth plays his role equitably, Mark Strong is meritorious, and even Jeff Bridges has a chuckle. They've earned their downtime as grander schemes await. ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is simply a very good movie because it delivers on its promises of keeping you distracted with sugary breakfast cereal and John Denver songs so you don't notice that every other aspect of true life is not worth the waking moments. Watch the movie, then sleep. We'll wake you for ""Geostorm""; I trust you wouldn't be able to sleep through that, anyway.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

372,pramsalim,A solid sequel by the British gents,8,26 September 2017,"This movie is the second installment of the extremely fun (and wickedly violent) Kingsman series. In this movie, Eggsy as the new Gallahad teams up with the American version of Kingsman called the Statesmen, after the Kingsman's headquarters were destroyed by a psychopathic lady who happens to be the Genghis Khan of the drug trade.It's wicked and absurd, just like it's predecessor. Some people think that this time, they went too far. I personally think that they did it really well. Same as John Wick's sequel, they were both bigger and more bombastic the second time 'round. They expanded their universe and gave plenty of exciting opportunities to go forward with their universe. With the American's Statesman made, they could delve into other cultures as well and make super-spy agencies out of them.A criticism that I agreed with is the fact that the movie is quite messy. So many stuff is happening inside this movie that it struggles to balance everything out. I could feel that while some parts were really exciting and fun, some parts were justdull. I'd say the movie could really benefit with some subplots being cut.In the end, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie (perhaps, partly because of my recent inactivity with my beloved movies). I thought the movie was really exciting and funny. Though perhaps not as good as the original, the charm could still be felt. The universe expanding, I thought was also really good. It sets up great potential for a big franchise. Too bad the critics didn't like it, I certainly liked this movie.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

374,columbusbuck,English Language's 2 Most Annoying Accents,4,26 September 2017,"Pretty much a formula action movie. If you have ever seen a James Bond movie or even the first Kingsman movie, you have pretty much seen this movie. Kingsman 2 has it's good points, but one overwhelming bad point sunk this movie for me. There are a couple of good points, namely Halle Berry and Julianne Moore. Berry somehow, someway looks 25 years younger. I don't know how she and the makeup team did it, but she looks fantastic. Her scenes are fresh to boot. Moore, on the other hand, really plays up the craziness. She's deliciously vamp and I loved every minute she was on screen. Now, the bad: The Accents. Namely, Scally and Deep South. Two of the most annoying English language accents on the planet if you ask me. Thankfully, Egerton only employs the former for 20 minutes or so in the first half hour of the movie (complete with tracksuits, drugs, and his similarly dressed lads). The latter however goes on and on and on for the last hour. Thank God the most annoying employer of the accent, Channing Tatum, only uses it for 20 minutes or so. Still, the accents grated on this reviewer's nerves enough to ruin the movie (had there been no accents, it was only an average movie at best). See it for Moore and Berry's parts, but FFWD through the rest. You won't miss anything.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

379,ronnietg,Kingsman: The Golden Circle,2,8 October 2017,"It is ironic that when a writer concocts so many sub-plots which take the audience off the Hero's main goal/desire, the main story line gets lost in the shuffle. This was what was happening in the first 10 minutes, until we got to the change of venue at Poppy's hang-out. We are introduced to the psychopathic opponent, Poppy, who does not flinch when one of her ""soldiers"" is committed into a meat grinder. She calmly makes a ""humanburger"" out of the hapless sub- opponent; dares her next ""soldier"" to eat the thing, while the audience tries to avoid vomiting. Not necessarily because of the disgusting concept of grinding a human being and then filming the ""humanburger"" for all to see, but because of just plain grossly overplayed attempts at humor with a classless script. Billed as action/comedy, this script continued to exacerbate the patience of an audience that actually was relieved by the special effects/blood/carnage/ destruction/body parts flying - I noticed the audience turning on their hand-held devices and catching up on e-mails, which was even more obnoxious than this script. The Hero, a young recent recruit into the secret service, simply did not have a believable story line. As with the genre of Mythology, this Hero set out to smite the dragons, one after another, using tools, weapons, impromptu devices, sci-fi gadgets, etc. This type of writing is predictable because after slaying one dragon, the rest are ho-hum going to be slain. There are no surprises in this script, other than a vast array of curious characters who enter and then depart. The Opponent, Poppy, is not particularly opposed to the Hero for any particular reason. She is not blocking what the Hero attempts to do because so many other unrelated characters march in and out of the script, as if they were tacked on to increase the Narrative Drive. This technique did not work. The audience attention was not on the Hero's character arc because the vast character displays with no significant web to speak of kept taking the audience OFF of the Narrative Drive - the exact opposite desired effect. The dialogue was in your face, with very little subtext. Predictable character development, to the point where except for the British crew and the British accents vs. the southern characters and the whiskey drinkers and down home brawls - The characters could have been interchangeable they were drawn in such a surface manner. Colin Firth, with temporary memory loss, did a superb job as usual because he is a fine actor. Jeff Bridges also did what he could with his whiskey saturated good old' boy routine leading a crew of men who all want to fight on the side for good vs. the evil ""out there."" Poppy, the opponent, was so ridiculous, the attempt at parody was lost. A good opponent works punch-counter-punch with a good Hero - back and forth, constantly giving the audience Reveals. This was not the case with this script. The result - Very boring, predictable, and clichéd.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
380,MovieWatchDad,Waaaaaaaay too many F-Bombs. About 20 minutes too long. Also silly and goofy.,6,30 December 2017,"I enjoyed the original Kingsman, but this one was disappointing. The amount of repeated unnecessary uses of the F-word was not only distasteful and offensive, but just downright annoying. The excessive, over-the-top, profanity was not at all entertaining. It was instead an un-ignorable distraction from any remaining entertainment value the film hoped to possess. Such intelligent, highly-trained, and refined 'gentlemanly' characters, unable to utter two consecutive sentences without the F-Bomb...poor judgment by the script writers.Also this sequel could easily have shaved off about 20 minutes of silliness and vulgar crude attempts at humor that were more of a turn-off than an opportunity to laugh. There were also random rogue scenes that left gaping plot holes with no follow-up after that particular scene was over. I read in the trivia that the original cut of this film was 3hrs and 40 minutes. Really? Who does that? It was finally edited down to 2 hr ans 21 minutes, which was still too long. If you removed all of the gross, vulgar, profane, silly, goofy, random, or preposterous filler content, you would easily have a prime cut of premium Grade-A Kingsman Spy Entertainment movie in under 2 hours. I would rather have enjoyed a better quality Kingsman film with a shorter run-time, than have to swallow all of the useless junk in this film just to finish the movie.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
381,mooviesuniverse,'Kingsman: The Secret Service' on steroids,7,25 September 2017,"When the Kingsman headquarters are destroyed Eggsy (Taron Egerton) learns of the existence of Statesman, the Kingsman's American counterpart. The two organizations must join forces to take on a common enemy.Right from the start it's obvious 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is going to be bigger and louder than its predecessor. The movie offers more over-the-top fight scenes, more gadgets and more characters. Sadly more doesn't mean better. At 141 minutes the movie is a bit too long. The opening scene is fun for about a minute but quickly becomes annoying. Not to mention the robotic dogs who should have never seen the light of day (along with Jar Jar Binks and that dude Mutt from the latest Indiana Jones to name a few). The story isn't all that great but writers Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman do their best to tie it up with the original. While the rather silly ""world domination/drugs plot"" is something you're more likely to see in 'Austin Powers' than in 'James Bond', it is fun. And that's what 'Kingsman' is all about. Although it lacks the punch of the original it's still a fun ride.The star-studded cast has a lot to do with that. Taron Egerton is eggcellent as Eggsy. He's a charming leading man and the combo with Mark Strong (Merlin) works a treat. Pedro Pascal as Whiskey fits right in but it's Julianne Moore who steals the show. Moore is cast as the villain (Poppy Adams) and she looks like she's having a blast. Too bad some of the new characters are underused. Channing Tatum as Tequila and Jeff Bridges as Champ come to mind.Vaughn who's back in the director's chair maketh yet another solid movie. The Zach Snyder like fight scenes look just as spectacular (hello electric lasso) as they do in the first movie, the jokes hit the mark more often than not (the dining scene) and the soundtrack only adds to the fun.If 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' wasn't your cup of tea you better stay away from this one.

385,lowgunberry13,Bond is only as good as the Villain-2x the action lesser Villain,5,9 December 2017,"KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLE"" (LOGAN AT THE MOVIES) 2015's ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" was filled with stars, along with very stylized action sequences; and a couple of big surprises. The follow-up shows us a few new tricks but it's nearly impossible to top that infamous church scene. Previous newbie Kingsman Eggsy (played by Taron Ederton) is now an expert agent. He's still in grief over the loss of his boss and friend Harry (Colin Firth), who was killed in the original ""KIngsman"". Those of you who seen the trailers for ""The Golden Circle"" know that Firth is brought back. The method in which it's done is one of the many unexpected and cool parts of the film. As for the villain, Samuel L. Jackson did a great job playing a wise cracking can't look at blood, tech mogul, who threatens nearly everyone on the planet. His agenda was climate change. For this one Julianne Moore (Poppy) a miss-cast drug dealer wants to legalize drug use. She wipes-out each of the Kingsman facilities in and around London, killing all the agents in the process,except for Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong) all thanks to a mole. So they join forces with their American counterparts, the Statesman, who are based in Kentucky. Halle Berry, Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges play three of the members. ""Kingsman 2"" doubles down on the major characters and the action. While some of it works the main villain does not. Moore's Poppy is not a strong villain. Unlike Jackson's cool sidekick with the leg blades, she has weird mechanical dogs and apparently has a really gross appetite. She's hiding away in the middle of nowhere and even worse she doesn't even meet with the other cast till the end of the film. Tatum and Bridges only have a few scenes especially compared to Sir Elton John. The music superstar plays a ridiculously cartoonish version of himself in at least a half-dozen scenes. It's really hard to watch kind of pointless and really ruins the flow of the movie. Firth's return does help. Plus his bro-mance with Egerton and Strong gives some much needed emotional and calming feeling, they are really cool scenes. There are a few decent references to the original that help usher the series around granted the door is left ajar for a third outing. Returning director Matthew Vaughn brings back what made the first ""Kingsman"" such a hit, and why it quickly built a large and loyal following: graphic, comedic violence and over-stylized, comic book action. But like any good Bond film you need a really good villain and this one just didn't work.R for sequences of strong violence, drug content, language throughout and some sexual material This is a very hard R film the violence is more over the top here than the 1st theirs a couple scenes were 2 people are thrown into a meat grinder and one is turned into a sandwich and the language is just as bad not just with cursing but in regards to sexual references. The 1st trailer that was released featured a woman undressing showing lingerie; while there is no nudity during this scene it felt like I was watching a clip from an adult version of ""The Magic School Bus"" as the camera cascades down her belly and follows a tracker inside her.

386,big_hair_x,Entertaining but disappointing,6,14 August 2018,"It was fun, though not quite as fun as the original, but what really disappointed me was having so many characters from the first film killed off in this one. Specifically Merlin and Roxxy, who both died in rather anticlimactic fashions (admittedly Roxxy dived out of the room/view so she may have survived for a sequel). After the build up of Merlin getting a suit and knife, to have him die like that (or at all) felt like a waste. And Roxxy is to this film what Newt was to Alien 3.I also felt Channing Tatum was wasted. I was looking forward to seeing him in this as he's always been entertaining but his role was practically a cameo.And why did Whisky have to be a bad guy?! Again, it felt like a waste of a good character/actor and kind of forced for him to turn traitor, intending to let millions die, for the reason he gave.Killing so many good characters didn't really add to the drama, and makes it a lot harder to look forwards to a third film.The president's reaction to the that was great though.

This movie believes people have low standards themselves and even lower expectations from sequels and they are so blindly going to watch no matter what junk is piled up in the name of a sequel. I kept believing may be the show will improve as it progresses, but it kept going downhill from the get go. What is wrong with this movie ? Almost Everything except may be a few good expressions by Mark Strong. But even then every character seems misplaced, just delivering lines for the sake of working in a sequel. Bruce Greenwood as a president of USA ? Jeff bridges as chief ? Pedro pascal as cowboy ? None of the actors seems to have put any effort towards their role. And If I did not mention about the role and performances of other characters it was mostly because it is not even worth talking about, yes that includes Julianne's. I think the writer of the movie is a 3rd grader or may be 2nd. Channing Tatum opens with heavy southern accent but then drops to typical mid western in next line. I think if you cant create a proper character, don't use a live actor, just use puppets. His dance was funny though. Clichéd dialogues, poor action, crappy gadgets, worst use of the worst cgi, hurriedly enacted script, and almost no plot. Well actually, my apologies, I would like to omit 'almost', there is really no plot. The forced reincarnation of Harry is very childish at the best. Again I have no idea why the scientific community does not stir up a protest when they see all kind of cooked up fancies in the name of science in a movie ? And the method of planting a nanite in a particular character is such an ugly attempt to James-Bondifying this movie that Albert R broccoli could be seen turning in his grave.

393,theshadow1963,Just watch the first half,5,24 September 2017,"Warning: Spoilers galore! Kingsman: The Golden Circle starts off well, recapturing the style of the original Kingsman: The Secret Service. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) continues to juggle his work with the Kingsman organization while it wreaks havoc on his private life. He's pursuing a relationship with the Swedish princess he rescued in the last movie when an enemy from his past triggers an attack that obliterates Kingsman with the exception of Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong, delivering the best, most nuanced performance of the film). If the movie had just focused on the aftermath of the attack, it probably would have been a lot better, and more coherent. Eggsy and Merlin learn that there is an American counterpart to Kingsman (called ""Statesman"") whose agents dress as cowboys and take code names of liquors. That's the fun part. But the plot also gets bogged down in a drug cartel called The Golden Circle, whose leader, a dippy nostalgia buff appropriately named Poppy (Julianne Moore, acting crazier than she has since Natural Born Killers). And this is where the trouble starts. Her plan to blackmail world leaders by poisoning her own drugs is utterly ridiculous and, once revealed, the movie's plot unravels at the same breakneck pace as its under-cranked fight scenes. It had no possible chance of success, even if the President of the United States is a murderous, self- serving tool (I guess we can count Matthew Vaughn and his writers among those who are REALLY butt-hurt about Trump winning the election). Jeff Bridges gives another standout performance as the head of Stateman, a role that seems as tailor-made for him as Michael Caine's was in the first Kingman. Halle Berry is mostly wasted in what amounts to an extended cameo. Elton John plays himself, but I could have done without the few minutes where the director tries to get us to forget that Sir Elton is 70 years old (maybe he was trying to distract us from the silliness of the plot). And when did Channing Tatum earn the right to Marlon Brando billing? His name is mentioned prominently in all of the publicity materials, but there are DOGS in this movie that have more screen time than he does. To summarize, Kingsman: The Golden Circle starts well, but spirals into cartoon-land about halfway through. It takes more than scenery- chewing villains and the willingness to ignore all the laws of physics to make a good action film.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
394,dinoplahutnik,Disappointing.,6,30 September 2017,"I hoped to get the same or better as I got from the first Kingsman: action, humor, a decent villain, a sensible plot. Instead, I got Elton John and a really lazy story line. I hope that this movie was not made with only profit in mind, because if that is so, I do believe that it is not a fair move towards the people who pay expensive tickets for some entertainment. The first movie had a fine line between comedy and absurd, this one crossed it. And that is only the beginning: so many good actors not used properly, story disconnected, sacrifice which was not really needed, the villain army reduced to vendors and cleaning staff, political agenda promoted, CGI up the wazoo...only a couple of scenes and jokes which could count for something, the rest (very) soon to be forgotten.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

I knew nothing of the previous film and didn't care to play catch up. A friend asked me to attend a screening last night and I obliged only because I'm a casual fan of Elton John and thought it might be a kick to see him do a one line cameo in the film. I was SHOCKED what a large role Elton had, and how hilarious it was! He stole the whole film! The audience was laughing out loud at his antics and some were howling with laughter! Overall, it's a stylish and well-filmed flick that required no concentration of any kind. It was like a mindless ride that unfortunately lasts about twenty minutes and one fight sequence too long! I enjoyed Juaianne Moore and Elton's performances. The rest were okay, but Jeff Bridges was totally useless other than as marquee value. What a waste of his talent! Elton gets a 10/10 but only a 4/10 for this silly, well-made, but instantly (other than Elton) forgettable live-action comic book.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
397,tomfry-10237,Style over substance,6,8 October 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is directed by Matthew Vaughn and stars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Colin Firth and Juliane Moore. In this sequel to 2014's Kingsman: The Secret Service, a new mysterious drug cartel known only as ""The Golden Circle"" are causing trouble for the Kingsman, resulting in a team up with their American counterparts: The Statesmen.Kingsman: The Secret Service was one of my favourite films of 2014. From its incredible use of Lynard Skynard's ""Free Bird"" in the mesmerisingly energetic church sequence to the characters seemingly ripped straight from the page of a comic book, it was a reinvigoration of a genre long in need of some fresh charisma. Therefore, hopes were high for the sequel. The marketing painted the film as Kingsman, but bigger, louder and crazier than before, and in that regard they did not disappoint. Within the first five minutes we have been thrust into the first action set piece of many, there are more characters, more crazy gadgets and more explosions than even Bond could handle. However, despite the film undoubtedly being bigger than its predecessor, I would be lying to say it is better. It appears that unfortunately heart has been sacrificed for scale here. For example, in the first film, the church sequence blew my mind, as it did for many others. In this film the filmmakers clearly attempt to recapture this lightning in a bottle, however miss the mark completely. After leaving the theatre mere hours ago I can hardly seem to remember even one outstanding action sequence, hardly even a good one. The main issue with them I find is that in the first film the most famous sequence was filmed in a very shaky manner in order to convey that sense of impulsive violence and lack of control; As a result of this most of the action sequences here are filmed in a similar manner. However there seems to be very little thought put into it, resulting in most of the action (especially the opening sequence) leaving the audience stunned and disorientated, yet not in the positive way the original did.Furthermore, there is a certain musician in this film that initially is there as a gag and is funny for a while, however, he then inexplicably becomes a main character and I still just cannot comprehend why. It was irritating, distracting beyond belief and just left a bad taste in my mouth.My final negative is with the structure of the overall film. Where the first was a clear cut origin story of a adolescent boy turned mature super spy and the personal trials and tribulations required in order to pursue this transformation (a slick and stylistic coming of age film) it is incredibly difficult to pinpoint what this film wants to be. It is so unfocused, with random side plots endlessly inserted seemingly just for the fun of it until the film simply seems to lose its identity: what does it want to say? What's the message?It is not all bad however. Most of the jokes still land to great effect as they did in the original, we have a multitude of A list actors giving their A game to deliver truly interesting characters that as an audience we care about, the standouts being Taron Egerton's ever lovable Eggsy and Mark Strong's Merlin, and visually the film still has that vibrancy and life that made the original such a standout in a genre saturated with bleak characters and vistas. I truly wanted to love this film. Yet unfortunately, certain stories and characters just don't lend themselves well to sequels. Look at Kick-Ass for example, amazing first film, poor cash in sequel. I think as an industry we need to learn that it does not matter how successful certain films are at the box office or how well they are received critically, certain stories do not need to be milked for sequels as they just won't work. It was fun, but it won't be remembered anywhere near as fondly as the first.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

As soon as the first scene came on the screen, I knew I had been fooled and it would end up being some of the most dreadful 2 hours in my movies watching history! I was right. This movie might have some actions but every moment is ""telephoned"" long in advance. The story is absolutely stupid. I wish it would be possible to request a full refund when a movie is that bad and that each refund is counted towards its overall success/failure.

I saw it back in theaters on word of mouth and loved it and have only grown to like it more with more viewings. So naturally I was excited to hear a sequel was coming out and that Matthew Vaughn was returning, and I can safely say I found it worth the money. There are a small handful of choices made in the movie that I won't spoil, but that I found just a little odd and thought they could have been slightly altered to easily get the same point across and not felt as weird. However, that said, I had a total blast with this movie. Yes, it's over the top and totally unrealistic, but that's part of the charm of it and one of the biggest draws of the original I thought. The performances are great, the story(while completely bonkers) is fun, the cinematography as well as the stunt work and visuals are incredible. I can't deny there were more than a few times I looked over to my buddies and commented on how awesome a particular moment was. And one thing I would kick myself for forgetting to mention, the musical score. I found myself wanting to look up the score after leaving the theater. Overall, a very enjoyable movie that you can easily have fun watching, with a few odd moments. I put it about on par with one or slightly below. A very good followup and I look forward to collecting the bluray and putting it next to the original on my shelf. If you enjoyed the first, I'd say definitely check it out.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
408,thefilmnotebook,Much less class than the first,6,31 October 2017,"If Kingsman: the Golden Circle managed to uphold the standard Kingsman: the Secret Service set, it would have been an above average movie. The elements presented in the Golden Circle are too familiar, and too comfortable. The Secret Service was exciting because it was inventive, and infused with the commanding presence of first class actors like Mark Strong, Colin Firth and Michael Caine, it was an elegant classic.In the Golden Circle, young Kingsman recruit Eggsy (Taron Egerton) returns, along with Merlin (Mark Strong) and Harry (Colin Firth) – his return was well known before the film's release. However, Matthew Vaughn makes the fatal mistake of replacing the characters that gave the first film its gentlemanly charm and decorum with drunken American cowboys. Although this transposition provided some degree of novelty – I was intrigued at the US version 'The Statesman', as compared to the Kingsmen, disappointment does set in when you realise they just ain't as classy – not to mention that profound waste of talent to cast Halle Berry, Jeff Bridges and Channing Tatum.I missed the iconic scenes that defined the Secret Service. There just aren't any memorable scenes in this one. Julianne Moore's Poppy Adams is quite fascinating at first – she does well embodying a dual sinister and pleasant demeanour, but once I found that she is just a loony psychopath, but loves putting people through a meat mincer, that's all that I needed to know about her. For the rest of the film, she just waits and waits, for people to get her. She also kidnaps Elton John – played by himself – who was immensely painful to watch. Why did you do this to yourself Elton?Overall, the little freshness this movie offers wears off quickly and the pleasure is momentary. Vaughn's decision to divert focus from the Kingsman to the Statesman is catastrophic for the characters, and for the story. The magical touch from the Secret Service is lost and all there is left is excessive zest and energy, which is great for loud, mindless fun, but not so good for preserving the gravitas that kept the first one grounded. But, if you love routine action with a tad too much embellishment, you might enjoy this.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

There's no complex dialog or character development, but it's a ""slap in your face"" type of comedy with one crazy thing after the other and it takes things a few steps further than the first instalment. The big hero of the film isn't Taron Egerton as Eggsy, nor is it Edward Holcroft as Charlie or Mark Strong as Merlin, or any of their American counterparts. The biggest hero - and the culprit of my almost broken ribs from laughing too hard, is Elton John himself!!! Putting one of the most flamboyant and colourful artists in a shabby track suit, cursing like a shav and giving the middle finger to the left and right - and then delivering a hilarious fight scene that would make Jackie Chan proud - that's a winner for me 7 days a week, and the reason why I'm scoring this movie the highest ever possible score - a 10! I've only ever done this once before but Kingsman: The Golden Circle deserves it for almost sending me to the hospital tonight!Matthew Vaughn did a splendid job here and he developed his skills producing and directing movies like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Harry Brown, Kick-Ass 1 & 2, Kingsmen: The Secret Service and Eddie the Eagle, and now he was given the task to direct this sequel which he did very well!.This is British humor at its best if you ask me and if you're after a big laugh rather than something complex and deep, this is the one for you!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

It forces an equality sign between *all* drug abusers and the rest of the society. There is even an allegory to the Trump-Hilton presidential race, with a white, male, weird-haired president being portrayed as the bad guy and a similarly white and weird-haired, but female counterpart as the poor girl who gets treated so very unfairly.In my opinion, Elton John's appearance highlights the same liberal message.Well, I don't like such propaganda in movies.

As an American, I found the heavy handed anti American/Trump mania distasteful. I don't go to this kind of film to hear the Office of the Presidency disparaged. Nor does being an American make me evil incarnate. The filmmaker and actors have a European opinion that we are all ugly Americas if you don't agree with their politics.

The world is bigger than anyone of us can imagine and just tuning in Fox News is not getting you anywhere. I like a lot of casts in this franchise but the movie simply is a repeat of what it was in the first and the moral behind the story far weaker than the previous one.

423,jackosmithy,Not as bad as people say,4,11 October 2017,"This movie is insane, Kingman: The Secret Service was insane too. One thing that people miss about this movie is that boundaries are supposed to be pushed and things are thrown into this movie that are not meant to be taken completely seriously. With that being said, there are still some negatives to this sequel.First, the positives. One is the style and energy of a movie like this which isn't lost in this. The second, in my opinion, is the acting of the majority of the actors in this. Third, I quite enjoy the insane lengths that these movies seem to go to shock the audience or perhaps squeeze out a laugh. The negatives of this movie are quite noticeable in this movie too. The biggest problem in my opinion is Julianne Moore's character. This problem shouldn't be too difficult to fix. In The Secret Service, Samuel L. Jackson played perhaps one of the most outrageous villains I have seen in a while with his lisp and phobia towards violence, which added so much humour to his character. When it comes to Julianne Moore's character (Julianna Moore wasn't too bad), there was no outrageous thing that added that humour and each time she was on the screen it almost got to a stage of boredom, which is not good for this movie. Another downside I found was the amazing action style that Matthew Vaughn has brought to these movies. While it is entertaining to watch, the opening action scene there was too many shots and there was too much to take in so the audience tends to fall behind and fall out of the movie. Also there was some actions scenes that came across a bit stereotypical and lacked that inventiveness like the bar scene did in the first movie.This is by no means a bad movie, it is just frustrating to see that the problems with this movie were completely preventable and just needed that extra creativity added to certain characters and scenes.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

The plot was convoluted and although I loved Colin Firth in the first movie this over the top bringing people back from head gun shot wounds was frankly ridiculous. They should never have killed off Merlin but hey they might stick him back together for the 3rd disaster.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
430,bj-bijaya,"Good action sequences, bad plot line",4,26 September 2017,"If you admired Kingsman: The Secret Service, then this film will disappoint you; not just from a single front but from multiple angles.With that said *SPOILERS AHEAD*First of all, the antagonists and their ploy isn't as threatening as it was in the first movie. While Julianne Moore as the villain was a good casting choice, her character Poppy does not even have the 'looks' of a villain, let alone her intentions to 'destroy the world'.Also, Colin Firth's Henry feels like a liability instead of the 'super agent' he was portrayed earlier. It is understandable as to why his character needed to be sloppy, but why would he not justify his actions ? Why does he keep quiet about his action to Eggsy? It is rather amusing that the screenwriter thought audience would never ask such questions.Kingsman: Golden Circle also does not justify the reason for having Golden Circle tattoos. Who gets them? Why do they get it? Also, why does Charlie's girlfriend have the tattoo if she is not actively involved in the ploy?How did so many cages appear at once? Why did people still enter the square after seeing so many people affected? Why did no one have a cell phone to inform the authorities that they were being captivated? Why are people kept like mannequins after they are paralyzed and not reclined? Why did no one think of going to a doctor immediately after developing the 'blue rash'? If Henry had such an affinity with butterflies, why was a dog his 'jump start' memory cue?Small nagging questions like these do not let you enjoy the action that so beautifully adorns the film. Wasting actors like Michael Gambon, Channing Tatum and Halle Berry in insignificant roles don't help either. I was prepared to enjoy the film thoroughly. But all the 'glitches' mentioned above plus seeing Elton John in such a horrendous character that does not even suit a hobo averted my hopes. Give it a try for action sequences, but make sure your 'logic' department in the head is shut down!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
431,mastersparky,Does it maketh a good sequel?,7,21 September 2017,"The original KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE came as quite the surprise to me. I'd heard very little about it and other than Colin Firth being involved and a decent looking trailer I wasn't all that excited about it. Upon the credits rolling I remember instantly looking up who the director was eager to watch more of his films A sign of a very good film.Matthew Vaughn worked very closely with Guy Richie back in the late nighties and early 2000s, acting as producer on both Lock Stock & Snatch – both of which are rated incredibly highly on my favorite movies of all–time list. The style and comedy of these films shines through in Vaughn's directorial debut Layer Cake back in 2004 and is most certainly still present in his latest little collection of films: THE KINGSMAN. It's this style that makes them so damn enjoyable, not taking itself too seriously and focusing on clever dialogue, fast and interesting action scenes and edited together in a sharp, energetic package with England as its backbone.Kingsman: The Golden Circle once again focuses on Eggs Unwin, played by Taron Egerton. The London 'chav' turned privately owned secret service gentleman. New villain Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore), is the head of the world's largest drug cartel posing as a pharmaceutical company, broadcasts a message telling the world about a toxin she laced within every recreational drug available, which causes blah blah bladdie blah.. Honestly the story is nonsense, this is all about the explosions, fights scenes and laughs on the journey to beating the big bad lady and that's it. If you're here for the story this isn't going to blow you away. Poppy's full motivations aren't made particularly clear at any point throughout the film and the story feels very much a copy and paste from the previous Kingsman outing. Julianne Moore also struggles to fill that gap left by the incredible performance of Samuel L. Jackson. This wouldn't be such a big issue if they weren't playing an almost identical role.As I've just mentioned the plot is rather weak, in fact the story even argues with itself at times. It""ll come as no surprise that the director who worked closely with Guy Richie doesn't have any problems with drugs (their filmography features many films with a lot of drug references) and the film occasionally takes time out from the explosions to explain how drugs aren't all that bad (much better for you than sugar would you believe! – thanks for that fact Matthew) but then later on uses the negative side of drugs as a motive for one of the characters and a few other rather jarring events that I won't ruin. It was a brave choice to deal with the war on drugs, however the the moral and social question is raised by the film and then it simply just sits on the fence. These conflicting messages ultimately left me scratching my head wondering what Vaughn was actually trying to say to me.Other than Poppy's evil plan being a little too familiar to its predecessors it does feature some incredibly creative moments. After opening with an adrenaline fueled race through the streets of London the films pace pulses nicely, featuring quick witted character scenes, hilarious cameos and some great action scenes; most notably the gun fight in the snow and the recreation of Colin Firth's ""Manners Maketh Man"" bar fight. Unfortunately none of them are as memorable or as fun as that famous church sequence from the original.Taron Egerton gives another fantastic performance as Eggs and demonstrates just how strong he is as an actor, especially in some particularly touching scenes. Mark Strong returns as his tech man and the chemistry between the two is top–class. The cast also includes the return of some familiar faces from the first film which was a welcomed surprise and of course the return of Colin Firth, although the impact is somewhat weakened by the fact he was featured on all the promotional material for the film. Sadly Kingsman 2 does tease us with some big stars who essentially do very little; Channing Tatum who features heavily on its advertising is barely in it and others are criminally underutilized. These actors weren't necessarily a draw for me to this film but for others this may prove to be a bigger complaint.The action scenes are undoubtedly the films main attraction and Vaughn has this fantastic ability to pull you right into the middle of the fight. You'll find your eyes locked open in amazement as the camera sweeps around legs and over stools all the while guys are getting whipped and throttled. Freeze framing in the most painful moments so you can appreciate the sheer terror and violence of the moment.The choreography of the fight scenes are also some of the best in Hollywood and the creativeness of some of these moments had me grinning from ear to ear. Even when the action finds itself compressed into tiny spaces (such as the back of a cab) the fight remains inventive and energetic. These very moments made the film for me and they still stand out as being some of the best action sequences I've witnessed since, well the first movie.Kingsman: The Golden Circle can simply be summed up as more of the same. It's weak plot and lack of any real character arc means it falls short of the original by some distance but it's unrelenting supply of energy and fun is impossible to resist. It's loud, dirty and far from gentlemanlike.If you enjoyed this review be sure to check out www.popcornography.co.uk for more reviews/news and movie related nonsense.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
432,peggynight-24258,disappointing,3,27 September 2017,"I loved the first one as it was fun and fresh and had the right touch of humour. However, this followup film feels really contrived and all of the attempts to contextualise the film to the first with characters, fight scenes and plot were just constant let-downs. The villains were less quirky and threatening, and the unraveling plot was rather preposterous. Even the funniest concept of a kidnapping of a superstar couldn't save the film, although it had its moments of hilarity.More to the point, the detail of the film was annoying, like everything seemed to fit together like someone had written it, which of course they have, but it's just all a little too contrived to enjoy.

Making a well dressed, cultivated educated sophisticated person using the ""Fuch"" word every few moments is just ridiculous. And sticking his finger in a womans privates is sick and just an obvious attempt to shock, just like the meat grinding and humanburger scene. The 1st movie was pretty good but this one is extream to the point of being silly. A waste of really good actors and demeaning. Most of the movie is either too silly or too extream to be enjoyable. I only gave it a 4 because og the great cast. There is a fine line between spoofing and silly. Today, the world is going to extreams. Extream sports, Extream politics, Extream entertainment, Extream proffits, Extream vulgarity and it is not good for society.

434,paulinho_riviera,Awesome visuals don't save this movie,3,23 October 2017,"Just to clarify I had very high hopes for this because I completely loved the first one, so I may be a little biased.I don't really know where to begin. I'll just list a few points that made me not like this movie, even though it had amazing visuals and some good action sequences.1) Completely anti-climatic. Both Julianne Moore and Pedro Pascal were not used very well as antagonists. Either in the end ,in the case of Moore, or to set up the character in case of Pascal. Both fell flat in the end.2) The Statesman were overall very silly characters with well thought names. I don't really get why would they decide to kill Roxy off while giving those characters more screen time, which leads me to point 3.3) The whole silliness of the movie. Sure, the first Kingmsan never took itself too seriously and it delivered a lot of comedy, but it actually had a plot that wasn't convoluted and was going somewhere.4) The amount of low-quality jokes. I don't mind a few of those when they are well-delivered honestly, and those may even appeal to a certain audience, but they didn't really fit with the movie in my opinion.5) TOO MUCH ELTON JOHN - really... it was fun the first time, but then it just kept getting more and more awfulI don't recommend it unless you want to kill some time (it's a bit too long as well - point 6), stick with the great first one. This movie definitely doesn't deserve the rating it has right now. 3/10",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

I couldn't describe in words what happens on the screen, I mean meat grinder for unworthy henchmen, and a hamburger stand atmosphere from the fifties to serve the person patty. I never liked Happy Days, but this redeems that genre's off beat look, and maintains the evil empire comparison to the fifties in America. Good research IMO. Get off your butt and go to this movie... Moore does her best fifty yard stare, and her flat tones are just like someone suffering from that syndrome where someone becomes loyal to a kidnapper. The truth is that Moore holds this one together, Bridges isn't bad. I didn't need the substitution of distilled malt for addictive drugs, however. Like they aren't comparable in danger to their users. I can't remember why the boss was compromised, but he was, and that plot line dominated. Whether he made it out of that situation, I can't remember either. So, the attempt at humanizing a spy network with weakness makes it more easy to relate to. The End.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
437,lynseylinzlu,Fun and entertaining sequel,7,20 September 2017,"Like many others I'm sure, I went into Kingsman 2 apprehensively.As a massive fan of the first I was concerned that like many other sequels, it would disappoint.I left entertained and pleasantly surprised HOWEVER it is not without its flaws .The story briefly- Eggsy (a brilliant again Taron Egerton)and Merlin have to team up with the American Kingsman 'The Statesmen' to get to the bottom of a virus being spread by Poppy, our films 'bad guy' played by a wonderfully evil Julianne Moore. There are some twists and turns along the way (the trailers already spoil the surprise return of Harry Hart but I will not give details of how this happens)some of which you wont expect (others are pretty obvious but more on that in a minute!)What I liked- For me it was great to revisit loved characters from the first and there are some interesting new characters. It is a fun film that is very reflective of the fact it is comic book material.It entertains with some great OTT action sequences and some real laugh out loud moments.The acting is strong and this helps to carry the story which somewhat engages. What will surprise many (as it did me) is the emotion to the film. It delivers some real emotionally charged moments and one scene delivers a particularly powerful gut punch.Where it does fall down-as already mentioned the story isn't the strongest and at points falls apart from too many players and some obvious plot twists.This creates a longer run time than the film can carry so it does lag at points. A good 20 minutes shorter would have made for a higher rating from myself. The action scenes whilst great also are very apparently CGI heavy which might bother some. It also does that cheeky thing of selling on some certain big stars which whilst this wasn't a particular draw for me, it might disappoint some to find they are actually only in the film for a few short scenes (those who see it will get exactly who I am talking about!!) To me it is comparable to Guardians of the Galaxy 2- some great moments that make you glad you decided to return, but it doesn't quite deliver on the story. That being said I would still recommend Kingsman 2 and would revisit this film again in the future as well as hope for a further installment.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

440,myjerkygameaddy,"""Kingsman: The Golden Shower""",1,30 November 2017,"This is what I call it... ""The Golden Shower"" I feel like anyone who actually pays money to watch this dumpster fire of a movie is volunteering to been urinated upon by Hollywood. It really is awful. How so? 1. Most of the set pieces, and action scenes in this movie rely almost exclusively on dated looking CG/green screen effects. This isn't 2005. Nobody wants to wants to see actors jumping up and down in front of imaginary opponents. It's dated, and it's cheap. This movie cost over 100 million dollars, and they give us these tired old tricks.2. There are enough A-list actors in this movie to make 3 completely different movies, but most of them are inconsequential are far as the plot is concerned. Some of them barely have speaking parts. What happened here? I want to understand. Why would you put Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, Halle Berry and Pedro Pascal in a movie, and then just not give them anything to do? 3. SPOILER! The mental gymnastics that this movie goes through just to set up a conflict is so convoluted, it's almost impressive. They resurrect a major villain from the last movie so he can become a minor villain in this movie...then he helps kill off almost all of the minor heroes from the last movie so they can make way for a whole new cast of minor heroes in this movie, who've apparently resurrected one of the main heroes who got killed off in the last movie. He got shot in the face point blank, and was dead for at least 20 minutes...but they had the miracle healing goo that they put on his face...so everything is...ughhh *pained expression* Seriously. What the hell is going on with this piece of s**t? 4. The humour is just bad. I don't know how else to explain it succinctly. They tried to do ""campy"" but they got ""tacky"" instead. I detected a bit of tongue-in-cheek criticism of U.S drug prohibition, which I can usually appreciate. Although somewhat predictable, this subtext COULD have been relevant. However, after about 30 minutes of viewing, expecting any audience to reflect thoughtfully about major legal, social issues is a bit of a stretch.I think I'm actually dumber for having watched this abomination.

After watching the trailer, I was very sure that it will be an action packed edition and will be as cool as its predecessor.The car chase at the beginning sets the tone for the movie which switches gear and goes at full throttle leaving you amazed. The action sequences are portrayed in the best possible manner and the entire stunt team should be given great accolades for their effort.If you had watched the first edition, you will find many sequences similar to them, especially the famous bar fight (Manners Maketh the Man) but with a twist in the sequence!!! With a truck load of superstars, (Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, Julianne Moore, Jeff Bridges, Pedro Pascal and more) added to this edition, the director has ensured to give justice to each of the actors giving them the screen presence. Especially, the action sequences involving Pedro Pascal and his Lasso is spectacular and awesome!!!Also, the humor content in the movie is absolutely terrific and is much required. The dialogues are pretty much filled with wit and humor, the exchanges between each one of the stars are worth every minute. Get ready to watch Elton John in the most colorful performance ever!!!Whiskey, Tequila, Ginger Ale, Champagne – I am not listing my favorite drinks but these are the character names of the cast in the movie!!!I am very much sure there is another edition coming up to this and I am very much looking forward for the 3rd installment of the Kingsman!!!The movie does justice to its first edition and falls in the action genre.

458,My_Evil_Hand,A movie ripe for a fanfiction rewrite,1,29 July 2018,"I loved the first movie, but the second is a franchise-killer. They literally killed off everything and everyone that made the first so unique and enjoyable, and then tried to replace them with some lame American counterpart. Lancelot's death was especially shameful, as she was killed off without a chance to save herself. Merlin at least got an opportunity to choose to sacrifice himself and die heroically. Once Lancelot was gone it was as if she'd never existed. 
One small bright spot was the way they used Elton John in the movie. While his initial scenes weren't great, they gave him a decently heroic part to play at the end.
It was OTT for the sake of being OTT, while being disgusting to boot, especially the hamburger sequence, and the planting of the tracker didn't need to be as graphic as it was. On the other hand it undid one of the great moments from the first movie, Galahad's death at the hands of the villain, which inspired his protege to take up the mantle. I should have known the movie was a lame ripoff just from seeing him in the trailer.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

460,wallmonster,Really entertaining in MX4D... but probably terrible on TV,7,27 September 2017,"Many of the reviews seem to be from super fans hung up on comparisons to the first film, as if that was high art.This film is a must see in MX4D as a proof of concept. Similar to IMAX documentary films in the 70's and 80's. They were very impressive on an IMAX screen but look silly on youtube.The 3D effects are quite impressive and well synced to the music and sound effects. Once again easily outperforming similar effects that required special glasses only a few years ago.As for the plot, the fish out of water theme is not quite as strong as the lead has somewhat adapted to his environment. This may be part of the disappointment for fans of the first film. There is plenty of over the top violence, some extended cameos and a quality sound track to keep things fun.Overall rating 9 in MX4D and 5 in a standard theater so I'll call it a 7.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

462,epistemologia-latimes,A distillation and worsening of the weaker aspects of the original movie.,4,5 September 2021,"Quite the disappointment.The first movie was at times unsettling, mostly because it was so over-the-top and violent, but also due to a few moments of simple, misplaced vulgarity. But there was also a well maintained mystique, a style if you will.This second movie keeps the bare minimum of the style and decisively ups the exagerations and the weaker, less palatable elements. There is a very confused, often self-sabotaging moral perspective at work here - not something that a movie about a self-righteous elite group can afford to have.And the vulgarity. Oh, the vulgarity. It has pretty much taken over.This is a movie with no soul, attempting to build one over the ghost of the previous one, which is mentioned far too often for this to even attempt to be its own thing, despite dramatic yet somehow also half-hearted attempts to upset and redefine the status quo.While technically there are many new elements and revelations, they are all utterly derivative and can't compensate for the loss of self-respect. The franchise has already become its own satire on its second installment.Such a pity.Maybe I just don't like Mark Millar's style. I don't know.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

471,gar-bran,Alas.......its a complete mess!,2,28 September 2017,"As a huge, huge fan of the first movie, its pains me to say, this film is a complete and utter mess. Its just all wrong. Its hard to believe this movie was made by the same people. Right from the outset its clear the story is really bad, its incoherent, childish and nonsensical. I thought to myself, 'Ok its a bad start, it will pick up, keep the faith!'. But it doesn't! It just bumbles along from the wildly unbelievable bad guy/lady (Julianne Moore), to the ridiculous premise of the movie, awful plot lines and script. It felt like the cast didn't even believe in the movie. Especially Colin Firth, he had a look on his face through the whole film like he new it was a flop. The plot line around his character was really awful. Like something a 5 year old child would dream up.The overall vibe of the movie is really hammy. They have gone complete slapstick which is a real shame. There are a couple of moments of humour and wit, but by god this is not a funny movie. It really isn't! All the attempts at humour fall way short. It all feels forced and desperate. The writers clearly ran out of ideas in a big way. This movie reminded me of Zoolander 2, a shambles that I wanted to walk out on.I knew the movie was 2hrs 20mins long. At a point in the movie it felt like the plot was wrapping up and it would all be over soon. I looked at my watch and realised we were only 1hr 20mins in. I thought to myself 'my word there is one whole hour left!'. I felt sad and like the next hour was going to be real hard work, which is a real shame. I leaned into my girlfriend and told her 'There is one more hour of this movie left!'. I wish I had taken a photo of her expression, it would speak a 1000 words. Needles to say it was a look of shock and deflation. She said to me 'Oh god really?'. Unfortunately the movie was so bad we were both crestfallen knowing we had another whole hour to go.The first movie was very funny, stylish, silly, witty and slick. The 2nd movie is none of those things. It feels like a very bad slapstick movie based on the James Bond premise. Its hard to believe they got it so wrong.This movie has a current rating on here of 7.3 stars. I have no idea on earth how it is getting that score. I can only assume the vast majority of people leaving reviews are 13 year old boys.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

474,domgwyther,The 'Die Another Day' of Kingsmen,3,18 December 2017,"This year has seen a number of the more original genre films in recent memory receive the sequel treatment. Back in 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy was a breath of fresh air for the superhero film, John Wick showed us how action films should be and Kingsman: The Secret Service injected a much-needed sense of fun back into the spy movie.Now, director Matthew Vaughn, along with an all-star cast return for The Golden Circle and waste absolutely no time in establishing that this is going to be 100% nuts.Before the film even starts the disembodied voice of Mark Strong bellows out, in character as Merlin, reminding the audience to switch off their phones or he'll 'repeat the church scene on us'.We're then treated to an insane opening car chase through London complete with android arms, mini-guns and a submarine, all set to Prince's Let's Go Crazy.By jumping the shark in the first five minutes, Vaughn quickly dispels all sense of realism, to quote Eggsy 'This ain't that kind of movie bruv'.As the plot about the sinister drug organisation of the title unfolds, things just get more and more ridiculous. There are robot dogs, there are laser lassos, there are even devices that can repair your brain following a head-shot.That last one is indicative of the main problem with Kingsman 2. There are no stakes. The first film was insane, but it still felt like there were consequences, thanks in no small part to the sheer level of violence on display. Here the tone and the plot lead you to believe that at any point someone will turn up with a gadget that will solve all the problems, save the day and no one will get hurt.The comedic tone has also become a bit of a problem. While the first film flirted with some fairly controversial punchlines, this time things go a step too far. Specifically, there is a sequence set at Glastonbury festival which is just gratuitous in every sense of the word. This scene, which has already started to grab headlines, is one of a couple of instances where the film slips into full Austin Powers territory.Although it sometimes oversteps the mark, The Golden Circle is here to have fun and on that front, it delivers in spades. The cast, both old and new, are clearly having the time of their lives and it's hard for that not to translate off-screen. Julianne Moore is wonderfully nuts as the murderous Poppy in a sickly sweet performance that calls back a certain Dolores Umbridge from the Harry Potter series (who is, in my opinion, one of the greatest screen villains in recent decades).The Statesman also make a predictably ostentatious debut. The American version of the Kingmen are represented by Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal and Halle Berry, all on fine form. While the introduction of the Statesman provides a new dimension to the world, it's a shame that a lot of what people loved about the first film i.e. the sheer British-ness, has been lost in the confusion.Sequelitis is on display in Kingsman 2 more so that any other follow-up this year. The filmmakers have fully embraced the 'bigger is better' approach and as a result, the film often feels bloated and overlong. There are at least two subplots that could have been cut out in their entirety, and the kinetic, frantic camerawork that made the 'church scene' from part one so memorable is definitely over-used this time around.That's not to say the film doesn't deliver some great fight sequences towards the end, it's just that we've spent an extra hour getting there that we didn't need. Likewise, some of the best humor is saved for the final act, and surprisingly enough it's often delivered by the one member of the cast who is not necessarily known for being an 'actor'.Kingsman: The Golden Circle is definitely fun, and on that level, it's a success. Much like Guardians 2 and John Wick 2 though, it can't recapture the fresh, genre-shaking impact of the first movie.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
475,fitzsy-36591,Kingsman: The Golden Circle Honest Review,9,25 September 2017,"From all the reviews gathering about Kingsman: The Golden Circle being a creatively lacking movie, i couldn't disagree more. We are hit head on with a taxi full of action and charming humour from the opening scene; this continues throughout the movie alongside the highly enjoyable plot and new antagonist and the impressively choreographed action sequences that were carried on from The Secret Service's Bar scene and church scene. All in all the movie had its faults and one that dragged it down mostly was the comedy sometimes feeling out of place but that can be forgiven and is made up for by the humour itself. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a far fetched theatrical plot that varies from serious spy movies by adding a creative spin on the genre.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

A sequel to the original Kingsmen: The Secret Service which was released back in 2014 the film stays with it's original protagonists whilst introducing many new characters also. The star-studded line up of Taron Egerton, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Julianne Moore, Halle Berry, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges not to mention the one and only Elton John.It was a great idea to introduce the British Kingsmen to the American Statesmen, while the contrast is clear, through out the movie they prove to work well together as a team.This movie's just filled with great action sequences in terms of fights, an action packed car chase and a cable car ride from hell.While the story might of been off on the absurd and unrealistic side and felt a tad draggy in places, it didn't steer me away from the fun this film has to offer 8.1/10",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

She delivered an awful performance and was not up to the same calibre as the other brilliant actors in this film. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I did continue to watch the film and finish it, however in the final scene where she who shalt not be named is made into a statesman, I had a little bit of sick in my mouth and will not be returning to watch the 3rd film as I worry she will replace merlin.

And while I can't say this movie is as good as it's predecessor, I can say that I enjoyed it immensely almost as much. It's a worthy sequel and I hope there's more on the way. Anyone who thinks this movie is silly or not up to the original really wasn't paying attention to the original. It was plenty silly and had much the same character dynamics as this one. I won't give away any of the plot, but I will say that I'm not one of these wanna be critics. I'm a working class guy and I just want to enjoy a good, fun movie and that's exactly what this is. Quite frankly, I just don't have time for anything that's serious or realistic because I get enough drama in my own life, I don't have time for drama coming out of my TV too. If you're a movie goer that yearns for that kinda crap, then get out there and get a real life and you'll be neck deep in it. I'm just saying that if you're like me, and want to watch movies that are pure fun, then this is it!One last thing, Merlin stole the show with his rendition of Country Road by John Denver.

483,RASlater,'Kingsman 2' Director ADMITS To Editing Out Anti-Trump Scenes For Ticket Sales,2,27 September 2017,"Paul Bois writes:Most of Hollywood has yet to understand that pushing leftism in their films and bashing half the audience doesn't exactly equal good ticket sales. Key word: Most. At least one Hollywood player, director Mathew Vaughn of Kingsman 2, has gotten the message.In an interview with EW, Vaughn explained that consideration for his audience led him to edit out several anti-Trump references in the blockbuster hit because he knew that people would not be pleased.Apparently the shady CEO, played by Julianne Moore in the film, had a few lines about wanting to host NBC's The Apprentice that were then deleted to keep the partisanship out.""We actually took out The Apprentice line,"" said Vaughn, ""because we felt it was too close to the bone. I think America's going through a pretty interesting and rough ride at the moment and I wanted this movie to be escapism. And that means not suddenly have half the audience going, 'That's not cool, that's not funny!' as the other half is cheering.""Another Trump dig was decorating a White House set in his signature gold and gaudy taste, which also did not make the final cut.""We were building a White House Oval Office in the style of Trump Tower. We were making it in all gold and blinging it up. This was in May of 2016 and then I had an inkling. I remember saying to my American production designer, 'Trump might win, you know? Would this be as funny if Trump won?' And he was like, 'Trump will never win.' And I said, 'You know what, I have a weird feeling he might. So let's build a normal Oval Office and scrap the Trump version.'""Looking back, Vaughn knows he made the right decision, because ""if you go too far — if movies get political when they're meant to be fun — then it weighs everything down a bit too much.""It only took a summer's worth of box office flops, poor ratings at the Oscars and Emmys, and the public's all-around disdain with Hollywood to realize the obvious: insulting customers just drives them away.Good for Vaughn for letting reason get in the way of partisanship for once.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
484,Bully_FU,What More Did People Want? It's a Fun Sequel,8,11 August 2018,"This film didn't set out to reinvent the spy film genre and was a solid continuation of the story told in the first film. I've seen others say this had nothing to do with the first film and i don't understand that complaint, at all. There were lots of callbacks and references made to the first film and this also included almost all of the surviving cast. It had a similar storyline of the Kingsman saving the world from a deadly virus of sorts, rushing to release the antidote in time and that was fine.The plot was good, the acting was solid, and the action sequences were a lot of fun. I'm not sure why people disliked this so much. This isn't any different than sequels to Bond or Mission Impossible in that its not trying to be somethings it's not, which is a fun spy film with lots of gadgets, over the top fights, and lots of action. The dialogue is a bit quippy and some of it is cheesy but no more than the first film. This was not trying to be more than the first was and I appreciated that. The first film was one of the most fun spy films to come along in a long time with how it didn't take itself too seriously and this did the same. I really have no complaints with this. I guess I would have liked some characters to last longer than they did but I understand why they didn't, not just within the plot itself when they were taken out but it would have been too bloated towards the end if they weren't taken off the board. They did bring back a character who died in the first and that showed some of the deceased characters may return if there are more stories to tell in the world they've built. If you want to be entertained like the first film and watch some quality action, give this a shot. If you don't like it then I have a hard time believing you really enjoyed the first very much. It doesn't reinvent the wheel but it didn't need to. I'd give it 7.5 out of 10 if that were an option but I rounded up to 8 instead because I felt this has taken a beating for no reason.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Understandably, this sequel (which I'll say now was fantastic for a sequel), tries to recapture what made the first film so special.This leads to my biggest problem with the film; It relies heavily on references to the first film to strengthen it. Much like A New Hope and The Force Awakens, the plot feels painfully similar. The creators advertised this in the trailers, calling back to what the first film described as being the best type of 'spy movie', with a colourful megalomaniac, exotic gadgets and that sort of thing. However, this is literally the framework used in the original.As the film reaches it's final sequence, there are more and more similarities, down to the last fight scene using a piece of music which builds similarly with the action as Free Bird did so effectively in the church from the original... But it doesn't feel like it works as well.Having said that, the film is a massive amount of fun. The comedy isn't as consistent as in the first and the use of CGI feels a bit more noticeable, especially in the impressive opening sequence, but it's a great film. The story is interesting, the 50s style of the main villain's base is attractive and the acting is as good here as it was in the previous entry. Elton John's part in this film is surprisingly prominent and so ridiculous that it becomes hilarious.To fully enjoy this, you'd need to be willing to suspend disbelief and get carried away. Also, ideally, to avoid seeing the parallels between this and the original, you would need to try and forget about it, but there's so much crossover that it's a difficult thing to do.Overall, while not as funny or as original as the first film, The Golden Circle is a strong sequel and is definitely worth a watch.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
500,musicmade,Kingsman: The Golden Circle,5,28 September 2017,"This movie COULD have been quite enjoyable in its entirety......but it wasn't. If you thoroughly enjoyed the FIRST Kingsman movie....then this installment was a slap in the face. I did enjoy the gadgets...some of the same returning actors. But some of the elements, mainly being ""normalizing"" cannibalism.....minimizing drug addictions, in an attempt to go for a shtick, kitchy irony. And then there was the obvious insinuation of making slams at the President....and attempting to nobilize Hillary Clinton. Nuff said. Although it started out as a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours...unfortunately it turned sour. And if the insults to the audience's sensibilities had occurred sooner than in the last 30 minutes, I would have been out of there. And trust me, I have only walked out of 2 other movies my whole life! I stuck it out, in spite of the cannibalism normalizing.....but much of it just went from bad to worse. This is definitely dollar rental fodder...or Netflix viewing....if THAT....but probably it would emit the same response...because then you wouldn't have to walk out....you just FLIP IT OFF.......Kingsman....you could have done SOOOO much better....but you didn't",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
501,mccallamk,Silly tedious boring sequel,2,25 December 2019,"Whilst the first kingsman movie was in no way ""realistic"" this sequel somehow manages to cross the line between enjoyable and entertaining fantasy to boringly stupid silly farce. I dare say many viewers would think the original Kingsman fell into the later category too, in which case I can only say that this sequel is much much worse.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
502,losplagas,Matthew Vaughn indulges in his signature style but to it's detriment.,5,26 February 2020,"Matthew Vaughn certainly is one of those filmmakers that really have their own style and when you see one of their films, you'll recognise it. However, some of these filmmakers know when to not go too far with it. They know when to stop sketching their names when making their films to form a coherent flow of story and development.Unfortunately, Matthew is not one of them in this case. Don't get me wrong, the movie is extremely enjoyable and worth the time if you just wanna have fun on a night off. However, it's hard not to look at it and see how far off Matthew has gone to write his name all over the movie. The action sequences are probably why I give this movie a 5 out of 10 stars. It's stylish, chaotic and extremely fun to watch. But everything else falls flat.The villain played by Julianne Moore is a major downgrade to Samuel L. Jackson's villain in the first movie. She really doesn't have much motivation than to just dominate the world with her drug business. The biggest disappointment to me, at least, is Harry Hart's return, played by Colin Firth. His death in the first movie was emotional and it made an impact on Eggsy (played by Taron Edgerton). Therefore, making some character development and motivation. His return sucks the emotional impact the first movie had when he died. All in all, everything about the movie from a narrative perspective is disappointing.This basically points at the header of my review. Matthew Vaughn seems to have focused more on style and action than creating some form of coherence for character development and story. And yes, if an action movie has those, it's a double win for me.Would recommend watching it if you're looking to watch something just to have fun.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

They are very over the top... (dare I say more than in Bond movies)I didn't like that they even placed CGI for the exterior of a saloon which wasn't credible enough... ( couldn't they find a shot in 'Murica somewhere??... Lord knows there are plenty of bars everywhere..)or for the interior of the Kentucky Kingsmen office, which was really badly rendered... where Jeff Bridges would stroll and you could tell that the perspective is all weird and the corners were nonexistent or the windows had rounded edges...

This movie was clearly paid by Alcohol trade to not only focus on their product, but to also take a jab on the marijuana industry. This was evident when they put marijuana in the same category with Heroin and Cocaine, while marijuana has become legalized, just like alcohol.

515,james-guest1,Poor film but does have originality,5,4 October 2017,"This film is very easy to criticise, there are some screamingly obvious negatives, but undeniably, there is a unique originality that puts the Kingsman films above a number of generic action films of late. What fans of the original Kingsman film, will find most distasteful is how the film has lost most of the small scale, quick witted fun that the first had, through it's numerous amount of exotic location changes and big budget CGI scenes. Unfortunately it has an underlying problem between the link of the first and second film, which is the change to a large budget franchise. It feels like a film that is gearing up for sequel after sequel, laying the foundations for more and more films, which inevitably lost my interest. It's also not helped by some poor acting performances, tiresome celebrity cameos and some low-level dialogue, which I believe to be down to the budget once again. However, the film does have its positives. First and foremost, the film doesn't take itself too seriously and even though that sounds like a negative it actually isn't. There is a sense of fun and excitement that stems through the well filmed action scenes. This point is very much lost in many modern day action films and shows a sense of originality. Cliché as it is, the film franchise offers a fun alternative to the Bond Films, rather than having to sit through a terrible Jason Statham action film.Is the film very good? No. The film is very average from start to finish containing some shoddy acting and CGI filled mayhem, but does however have elements of the first films quick witted fun. A film to switch the brain off to, but nothing more.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
516,redclowng,Sequel that lost its elegance,6,14 January 2018,"Kingsman the Secret Service started a new trilogy of a ""bond"" movie done in style. Movie was enjoyable and memorable, different than other action movies, elegant.
Sequel sadly lost its elegance and went to the path of silliness. It is not a bad movie but neither something special as the first was.
Movie goes even more to science fiction where even death can't be taken seriously or have consequences. You can see everything, robot dogs, head shots that can be treated like it was a scratch or gadgets that Bond would kill for.Cool opening sequence gave us a good promising movie which from there was getting dumber and dumber.
It seems that they want to gave us villain that have it's own style and is completely different from others but it just felt silly, stupid and forced. All the robotic dogs and maid felt out of place.
Most of the deaths doesn't feel like it means anything. Ignored Eggsy's friend that died at the beginning is not even mentioned, is no one concerned about other Kingsman and it's whole branch? Head shot cure? Wasn't there a better and more logical way? Elton John? His jokes and ending were just a disaster.
Harry having hallucinations and lacking coordination was suddenly gone? Caging victims? Why did they had to kill Whiskey? He had his own solid motive. After he is killed they even throw a joke which makes you slightly dislike main characters and no one from States Man is not concerned?
Many questions will rise in your mind after finishing this movie.A lot of serious moments that should let you sit holding your breath or feeling down and sad are ruined by out of place jokes. Merlin sacrifice would have much more touching. It wouldn't be even surprising if he would appear in another sequel with robotic leg.Since it is an action movie you can sit down and watch a pretty decent action and cgi. Memorable scenes are missing, however you wont be that much disappointed.
Hopefully the third part of the franchise will return to it's style that we have seen in the first one,",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

518,letitbelau,An average spy flick,6,29 September 2017,"First of all, I want to declare that I went to see this movie in ignorance of the original film so this review may not be useful to those who have seen the first film. Do not worry if you haven't seen the first one because the movie explains a bit of what happened before the main character became Kingsman and it is easy to follow. The story is summarized in two elite secret organizations which must band together to defeat a common enemy that wants to take over the world. In a nutshell, I found it to be quite a plain movie with predictable twists and basic plot. I got already bored past the first hour of the movie and even though it as decent I just kept wishing the end was near.There were many things that didn't work out for me including the lack of catchy lines, wit references and clever cultural jokes which leads to forceful laughs. However, what really saddens me is the lack of character development as they had great actors on their hands and could've taken much more advantage of them but for some reason they decided not to. I didn't even felt moved when strong emotionally charged scenes took place. The only thing that may have saved this movie from being a total let down is the fact that has some cool action scenes mixed with a great cast whose performances are unfortunately limited because of their obvious script. In addition to this, I enjoyed the British scenery and the way they linked and compared it with the American culture. It is visually satisfying. Also, in the running of the movie you get used to the vulgar humour that you actually find yourself falling for the childish wordplay. To sum up, I do not regret the choice I made to watch this movie and even though it is clearly flawed it is still decent and I would recommend it to watch it a Sunday afternoon if you want to slightly entertain yourself and basically kill the time.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

A lot of reviews on here with low stars all have something in common, that all say it's too violent. In my opinion yes it's violent but that shouldn't mean it should get a low rating, think of how many things are violent out there that people love, Call of Duty, Deadpool, Kick - Ass, etc. 
If you take out the violence there are so many good points, great acting, awesome effects and to me a unique storyline. There is no doubt this film has cringy moments but there is no film without them.
Something that also stands out to me (more in secret service than golden circle) is the good portrayal of working class England. As someone who comes from a similar area to Eggsy (except up North) I love the idea of someone becoming a 'hero' of sorts.Really the main point I wanted to make was when watching be open minded and think about how many other much loved films/games are rude and violent before judging this one for it.

Before seeing the movie I thought that he might die early on and won't be in the movie as much . But then Channing slept through the whole movie and Jeff had two maybe three scenes, while Pedro KILLED his role and should get more recognition. And I kinda didn't like that they gave him such an awesome weapon and such and interesting character *SPOILER* and then killed him, I really enjoyed his fighting scenes and I am looking forward to more action like that in the third film.Overall the movie was fun, the action scenes were gold and it was directed geniusly.

Long story short, I left the theater a bit underwhelmed and I knew I'd set the bar too high. That aside, the movie does satisfy all aspects of what an action movie is expected to be.The story itself seems to be creatively done, but not executed as well as the first movie. Of course, there is a well-thought out and original psychopathic villain, but the movie is less riveting, and (unfortunately) less humorous. I, however, say that with the best intentions because I still have hope in this franchise.Though it may seem that this movie was a complete let down as I describe it, it really isn't as bad as people may think. The fight scenes had been done very well, the gadgets almost as showy as those of the first movie. Additionally, there is something so satisfying about getting every little piece in the story that references the last movie. That being said, I'd suggest watching Kingsman: The Secret Service first, or you might be spending much of your time after the movie on the Internet, laboring over every detail you didn't understand in The Golden Circle. It was almost like the Kingsman I so dearly knew and loved, but not quite. It is not at all a waste of your time (even if you do decide to disregard my recommendations on watching the first movie).

535,SjaakadeliC,"2017, the year of John Denver's 'Country Roads'",5,2 October 2017,"Let me begin saying this; Kingsman: the Golden Circle is worse in every way as to the original. After Alien:Covenant and Logan Lucky, now it's time for Kingsman to utilize Country Roads as part of the plot or a character. Seems like the song was on sale in 2017.We begin the movie with Eggsy being as Kingsman, being confronted by the Kingsman dropout Charlie turned henchman. They have an over the top, sometimes nauseating camera-work fight scene and full of bad CGI cars. (greenscreen is used often in the movie).Henchman's metal arm hacks into Kingsman database. New bad guy Poppy(Julianne Moore) blows up every Kingsman... even Roxy. YOU KILL OF AN AWESOME CHARACTER THAT EVERYONE WANTED TO SEE IN ACTION!? Only Eggsy and Merlin survive. Eggsy's dog JB(the pug) also gets killed, yet Eggysy doesn't shed a tear and in one of the following scenes he gets a new dog, a pug, who of course looks exactly the same. JB is never referenced again, and neither is Roxy. I wanted to see the whole Kingsman crew in action. The hierarchy of that secret service... but no, everyone gets blown up in the first 10 minutes. So it's not even Kingsman anymore, it's more like Eggsy&Merlin; buddy spy movie. The movie truly feels like it was designed to be the third in a trilogy, but they forgot to make the second movie.The plot is almost non existent. Almost no character has been fleshed out or has been given something to do. Minimal growth through the movie. They don't learn anything or actually do anything. Eggsy: he has relationship problem with Princess, while juggling his relationship and being a Kingsman. Princess Tilde: Does drugs(for absolutely no reason), gets infected for no reason. Poppy(Julianne Moore): Wants to be recognized, has a dumb evil plot. She isn't menacing or even dangerous. No idea why everyone is scared of the woman... she just keeps two robot dogs. Harry(Colin Firth): back from the dead to mess up sometimes and to tell Eggsy he has to marry girlfriend, because he felt lonely when he died. Roxy: dies in first 5 minutes. Tequila(Channing Tatum): in movie for 2 scenes, yet top billed and advertised. Gets taken out because he does cocaine. Champ(Jeff Bridges): head honcho of the Statesman. Does nothing, rubs whiskey under his nose. Could be left out of the movie, wouldn't matter. Ginger(Halle Barry): Female Merlin counterpart of Statesman, does nothing. Could be left out of the movie, wouldn't matter. Merlin: Best part of the movie, but also killed. Kingsman chaps have mine detector, still step on mine regardless. I read that Mark Strong actually filmed the end scene where Eggsy and the princess get married. But the director rather had the character dead, so that Merlin could sing 'Country Roads'. Good scene, useless death. Pedro Pascal: Fun character. You could tell Pedro had fun making this movie. The only character that had an interesting story arc. I could feel his pain as to the death of his girlfriend. You could tell from a mile away they would fight Whiskey at the end. But he wasn't really a bad guy in my book, they just said he was and had to be killed. Elton John: Says the F-word a lot and has too much screen time as a running gag. The gag gets old quickly. Elton also breaks the 4th wall...The worst still was the girlfriend of the Henchman... Clara. The woman who has a golden tramp-stamp and gets the finger, yet has no qualities for being a Golden Circle henchman. The movie was 2½ hours long and her story arc took up about 30 minutes, just to justify one action scene in a gondola and the fingering scene for being edgy.Oh, and the President of the USA is a maniac, has a secretary of State that looks like Hillary Clinton, and gets impeached at the end of the movie. (This apparently was a greater subplot of the movie, but was scrapped by directory because it would affect ticket sales)Kingsman: the Golden Circle, deserves a 5/10 at best.

We continue into a reconstruction effort and a war against the lovely female drug lord Poppy (Julianne Moore).Julianne Moore gives her character Poppy justice with a balanced and calculated on the edge sweet psychopath, always ready to pounce gently on you and devour you with her demure and modest pretense. She bought me over with her performance and style.The other characters did justice to their rolls and performed a brilliant display of action and soft comedy drama.I don't want to spoil the films story outline so I shall refrain further description and just urge does who want some action and laughter to go and see this film.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
540,rklot,A disappointing drop off from the first one,5,30 September 2017,"I went into this film with high expectations, having loved the first one. I liked the premise of the Kingsmen having to discover and work with the Statesmen after the attack.I came out of the film considerably disappointed. It started off fast and promising, but slowed to a crawl several times after the start. The film was at least 20, possibly 30 minutes too long for what it delivered. I felt that they spent far too long on the 'drugs are bad - let them all die' aspect and also on the time it took for Harry to regain his memories.The Statesmen characters were mostly cardboard cutouts with minimal substance, personality, or background. Halle Berry's character was the only one who stood out to me, and she didn't get enough screen time to do much with.Julianne Moore's villain was so over the top that she seemed a parody of a parody.Killing off Roxy was bad enough, but having Merlin die needlessly too made it seem like they were purposely trying to not have enough remaining characters to try for a 3rd movie.The fight scenes were again over the top, but almost comically so, and didn't compare favorably to those in the first film.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

543,rutharoni,You can't put a bowling ball on top of a pencil.,3,3 March 2018,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle has a lot going for it. The choreography is spectacular, the premise is interesting, the style is refreshing. Unfortunately, these things have no solid plot base to stand on in the movie, leaving an unbalanced, meandering film. When I watched this movie I was left wondering: what am I supposed to care about here? Am I supposed to feel emotionally invested in the main character's efforts to balance his spy career and his love life? Approximately two and a half scenes are spent establishing that conflict, before it's wrapped up in a bow and married off at the end. Am I supposed to care about the main character re-connecting with his former mentor? Some far-fetched plot devices and CGI butterflies establish that pretty efficiently, before it too is tidily wrapped up by the end. What about the sudden dispatching of 80% of the cast from the original movie within the first ten minutes? Should I care about that? Apparently not, since one scene about drinking a toast to fallen comrades wrapped that up nicely. I haven't even gotten to all the other questions this movie raised. Should I care about the American version of the Kingsmen, the ""Statesmen""? Should I care about the Halle Berry character wanting to get ""out into the field?"" Should I care about the Channing Tatum character being a ""rebel""? Should I care about the traitor amongst them, who is granted what I'm convinced is a world-record 8 seconds to explain his tragic motivations? Should I care about the President of the USA being evil? Should I care about his mistreated assistant?
Should I be interested in Julianne Moore's crazy villain, or only slightly confused? Should I care about the former Kingsmen trainee looking for revenge? Should I care about his ex-girlfriend and her music concert? (It's exactly as ridiculous as it sounds.) Should I care about Elton John and robot dogs?! By the end of this sloppy garbage monster of a plot, you barely blink an eye when a main character is violently exploded in front of his closest friends. Should you care about his death? You're probably supposed to. However, in the end, you've asked yourself so many questions that you just want it to be over.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
544,sora-kwon,"Great cast, mess of a movie",2,9 July 2018,I agree with the majority of the reviews here. The aesthetic was cool. But everything else felt so forced. Using Fox News people was beyond jarring. It made me hate the movie more.,Kingsman - The Golden Circle
545,trevren11,The worst spy movie I have ever seen,1,29 September 2017,"***Contains spoilers***I rarely review movies, but this one was just so bad. I wasn't expecting much from the sequel to a pretty decent first movie, but everything was just terrible. It was a good premise and had so many good actors but the writing was downright sad.Just some of the poorly contrived ideas:The plot: Nobody is going to want to do drugs ever again, the whole idea was to force the governments to make drugs legal, OK that is fine, but to attempt to kill (and successfully kill many thousands at least) every single drug user unless governments comply would turn off so many of the users, effectively killing their business they are trying to grow, and since they had a monopoly on it it would also have to deal with antitrust laws etc. anyway. The little trust they would have would be obliteratedThe cages: To treat the diseased, everyone is placed in human cages inside of stadiums. First off, those cages didn't just happen one day, somebody had to be like, ""You what we might need in the future? Tens of millions of human cages."" These cages are stacked on top of each other to the height of huge stadiums (note that everyone is dancing inside of these small cages, no way it would topple) even though nobody is even dangerous.The electric whip: No only are all of the Statesmen extremely 'American' and have stupid names, the whip extends ~20 feet and has a power source powerful enough to cut a body in two (yeah, it happens), but it all fits within a small handle that is the same thickness as the first ~10 feet of the whip.The floodable padded observation room: I can just imagine the designers now, ""Gary, we need this observation room to be floodable in a moments notice""The goo bomb: Is nobody going to explain what that was? Just some huge bomb that solidifies mid explosion? OKThe amazingly spinny ski lift: Because it needs to have the option to spin at 120 rpm in the off chance somebody is escaping down the mountain at 10 miles per hour. The fact that it rotates even though it is already completely glass doesn't make any sense eitherThe number of drones: Nobody missed an order (or thousands of orders) of hundreds and hundreds of drones to treat everybody in the world with? I'm no expert, but I don't think anybody lives close enough to Mount Blanc to be reached by drones anywayElton John: He had one good part getting in front of the dog, but everything else just seemed like they were using him for cheap laughs that didn't pan out like they were hopingThe finger condom: You are telling me they have so many advanced gadgets but they have to use a finger condom to get a tracker on someone. Not to mention their watch supposedly already should have hacked the concert skanks phone when they got close which would have given them the GPS and audio they were wanting in the first place.Viva las vegans: The whole code that saved humanity was something that the movie wasn't even about. The head bandage that can freeze a brain so we can regrow the brain and all of the neural connections. Because that is remotely believableDrug lord lady: Not only does she have a 50's style mini-town on a mountain with very obvious (yet undiscovered) ruins right by it complete with a theater that can fit over a thousand people that nobody has seen, she has all of these outlandish technological advances like the killer robot dogs, but has a simple minefield keeping invaders out. Also the dogs should have been hacked just like the second arm (and the first that conveniently wasn't hacked in the time they were under water)Robot dogs: Just why The mine: OK there was only a split second to reapply pressure on the landmine that killed one of the only cool characters, but why not put a very large rock on it. They don't take a lot of pressure and all I could think about was what if another one of them stepped on a land mine, then only one person would be standing awkwardly in the forest without a tripped land mine (especially since they stopped using the land mine detecting bat)Everything that the Statesmen had in their arsenal: The bat that was a land mine detector, yeah that was a good idea Gerry. The baseball grenade with a HUGE red button as the trigger (what could go wrong), and everything else under the pool table.Suitcase gun: It was OK in the first one, but why did they need it when they were landing in the jungle, it just seems unnecessary.The lady that led to the impeachment of the president was mostly just mad she almost died because she was a druggie. And her reason for using was she worked 20 hour days 7 days a week, not only is that just dumb to even say, you are the adviser to the president, he can get another helper if you are too busy, so that was all her fault. They weren't really gentlemen throughout the movie, so when Eggsy pulls out the chair for Halle Berry it seemed awkward and forced.There are probably some errors and my views are likely different than yours, it is just my opinion of this terrible, terrible movie. I would suggest you reserve the viewing of this film for a late night when you are all out of Sharknado movies",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
546,Corp_Hicks,The end of what could have been a successful franchise.,4,6 January 2018,"When the first Kingsman was released I was quite surprised and pretty much enjoyed this over the top homage to British spy movies with all their gadgets saving the world with style. Only the unnecessary church massacre and the rather shocking out of place anal joke left a bitter taste. So what to expect from the sequel? The motto is the bigger the better. Unfortunately as so often that particular strategy goes wrong.The plot (if you can call it that) is all over the place and just messy. Julianne Moore plays ever smiling Poppy, the biggest drug dealer in the world. She decides to infect every drug user with a virus that will kill you if not being treated with the antidote that she also holds in her hands. I don't know how often that story has been told. She wipes out all Kingsmen except for Eggsy and Merlin. Teaming up with their American counterpart, the Statesmen, they will save the world. Enough of that, you know the rest. Here are some points that bothered me.1) The unnecessary cruelty in this movie is mind blowing. The meat grinder scene could be out of a slasher movie but zero blood makes it just laughable. Preparing a burger out of that person is not funny, its just simply sick. I do not have the impression that the director wanted to show Poppy as a maniac psychopath or was it? In any ways it didn't work for me.2) What is the point of having Channing Tatum in it? His screen time is less than 5 minutes. Of course, back in Part 3, right? That is just sneaky and cheap especially after how this movie was promoted. Well, stupid me, I felt for it.3) The death of Roxy was unacceptable. I am aware she most likely will appear again in part 3 so this is another cheap attempt from the director (remember Glenn's death in TWD). And if she should be really dead then what a waste. I rather watch her and Eggsy figure out a way to stop Poppy than introducing a whole new cast.4) Are you telling me that literally everybody is taking drugs? Eggsy's friend, Tequila, the presidents aide too, really? And her excuse is burnout? You got to be kidding me. Great message to all the girls out there. The anal princess? Why? Because she is angry at Eggsy? Hell yeah, when I am angry or depressed I will also start using heroine because it's so easy to get.5) Colin Firth is so lifeless in this movie it is scary.6) Robot dogs, really?7) Elton John's cameo was overdone. He became a pest constantly yelling *fuxx*.8) Jeff Bridges has done that voice over and over again. I can't hear it anymore. Feels like watching RIPD again (horrid!).9) The panty scene was borderline pornographic.10) Merlin sacrificing himself was a joke. Not just that seconds ago they were handed out mine tracking devices (why not use it?), but you are telling me that with all that Sci-Fi gadgets they have, that bomb was an issue? You can shoot people in the face for Christ Sake and magically survive thanks to some silicone gluey thingy. And of course the freezing spray was empty. I hate these forced plot devices. Remember Wonder Woman when pretty boy HAD to sacrifice himself in the end? The same BS.11) Country road, I can't hear it anymore.12) Why taking the antidote out of its protection? My wife made a face through the entire movie but that was the moment she complained about their stupidity. I have to agree, again a forced scene just to drag the plot along.13) Eggsy and Harry murdered Poppy cold-blooded. They didn't even had the password yet but trusted she will tell them. For some reason she did, then dropped dead. No judge, no prison, just killed with an overdose. They even joked about it. Both are murderers who don't care who lives or dies. Eggsy also snapped the other guys neck, wow. How I miss a leg or arm shot. Anything to just immobilize a person without taking his life. But hey, reading the news in US about police unable to do the same, maybe that's just the way it is. But for Eggsy and Harry, I cannot sympathize with them anymore.14) Fox News! Enough said.15) The laughable scene where Ginger finally got her spot at the table is a true inspiration for all the hard working ladies out there. You can make it BUT only if one of the males is out of the picture. Good for you girl.16) The cages, good lord. I wanted to laugh about how ridiculous that scene was but I simply couldn't get my head around the logistics. First of all who provided all these cages? Which miracle manufacturer supplied them? Just staple them all up, one by one. I love it.17) CGI is pretty shabby for 2017.18) Was I missing something regarding the Whiskey character? He was portrayed as a bad guy but did they even listen to what he said? He lost the love of his life who was pregnant with his child due to drugs. It makes very much sense that he wants to get rid of all drug users so that such a tragedy won't happen again. There was no reason to kill him in the meat grinder like that. He was one of the good guys who just needed to be convinced. To slaughter him like a cheap henchman after what he went through is unbelievable. Also, instead of overpowering him earlier in the shed Harry simply shot him in the face. Because that is how you solve problems in this movie. The pizza boy cannot give you back change? Shoot him in the face. Your mom tells you we are out of milk? Shoot her in the face. Don't worry, gluey magic stuff will bring them back to life.There is more, believe me. I am just getting irritated again thinking about this movie. Part 3 is announced anyways, then we will see Ginger, Tequila and Soda back in action...but I am out. Eggsy lost his charm and Harry is plain creepy. The only character I root for is/was Roxy and Merlin, both gone...OR are they? *sigh*",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

This second instalment feels a great deal like the first movie, which is a good thing. Sure, the storyline is quite similar to that of the first (quirky megalomaniac has a doomsday device to wipe out millions), but I am fine with that; there are very few absolutely original stories out there. One thing about this movie is the number of SHOCKING scenes! There were at least three scenes that left my wife and me slack jawed - there are a couple things in this movie that you've never seen before in a movie! No big spoilers or anything, but there's a certain scene with an electric lasso and one scene with a different kind of sexual encounter that opened my eyes wide open.

More silly than a very silly thing. The action is so OTT that it just made me laugh. Julianne Moore as the villain was about as terrifying as a labradoodle puppy. Pedro Pascal (who I loved in GoT) is just completely unbelievable. As is Channing Tatum. There are good performances - as always, Jeff Bridges is entertaining, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Taron Egerton, Halle Berry, Hanna Elstrom and Emily Watson (fantastic cast isn't it!) are all terrific.

It seems like it's the cool thing to do nowadays to take what is supposed to be a fun action movie and expect it to be the next Citizen Kane. Some movies are just supposed to be fun and keep you entertained. That's how I felt about this movie. It had a decent cast and brought back several people from the first movie, even if briefly. I thought that some of the over-the-top weapons and gadgets, especially from the ""Statesman"" side really made this a joy to watch. There were points in the movie when I audibly said ""Are you kidding me? This is awesome!"" And that, in a nutshell is what the ""Kingsman"" movies are all about. Cheeky, sometimes dirty humor with all the nifty gadgets you can imagine. Kind of like James Bond before they turned him into an AK-47 wielding action movie star rather than a debonair spy. If you want two hours of entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously but can still manage to tug on your heartstrings a little, give this movie a shot.

It continues right where it left off with Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, as an agent for Kingsman. Here, something big happens and he teams up with Merlin, played by Mark Strong, to ""save the world.""The movie is a visual thrill ride, with the most absurd action sequences you will ever see. Guns popping out of umbrellas and briefcases, advanced watches that can do anything imaginable, and much more. The cinematography was absolutely wonderful.Unfortunately, this is where the praising of the movie ends. The movie is quite choppy with its transition through action sequences. The plot is as convoluted as Suicide Squad's, with all its unnecessary subplots. During the second act, it was really hard to tell what the heck was going on in the movie. When I was able to comprehend all the mumbo-jumbo that was being showcased, yet another curve ball was thrown to make things more confusing.One of the characters who seems like a significant player does not need to be in the movie. The way the movie justifies that characters presence towards the end is very predictable and unneeded. Without the character, the movie would have been around 10 minutes shorter and it would not have made a difference in the end goal.Now, you may be thinking that ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" must have been an unbearable movie, but in truth, it is not. The action sequences and visuals make up for the plot mishaps. It is a fun and crazy movie to watch. Rarely, are action movies this ridiculous, and still, provide quite the amusement.

This would not have really been an issue if it was genuinely funny; but instead of wit and clever wordplay, we are 'treated' to an abundance of uninspired, vulgar and childish humour. Elton John repeatedly dropping the F-Bomb (Please, don't go on), a attractive woman asking someone to urinate on her (I can't stop laughing), or an old man stating that he has just soiled himself (Stop, my sides are hurting).

The first one was fun, entertaining and moderately inventive with it's story line. This second installment however, was a huge disappointment. All of the things that made the first one enjoyable are missing from this attempt. I won't bore you with the story line as it's possibly the most inane effort I've seen in a long time. Below are the issues that make this a complete waste of time: 1. Not since a Rogan/Franco effort has the legalization of drugs, not just weed, but all drugs been pushed as hard as the writers attempted here. The drug users were all portrayed as ""victims"" who couldn't cope with their lives and then ""rightfully"" turned to drug use to make it through the day. 2. Yes, of course, the President was the main villain as were several other white males. 3. The primary villain was a female who was shunned by the business world solely due to her gender and resorted to drug sales as a means of showing the world that she was better than everyone else as a business mogul. 4. The ""Matrix-like"" action sequences were mundane and dated. 5. For a film that uses the catch-phrase ""Manners maketh the man"", the overwhelming usage of F-bombs by all the characters was insulting. By the end I could care less if the ""heroes"" won the day.Disjointed and all over the place, this film was a complete waste of time which was very disappointing as I had moderate hopes for a repeat of the first film which I thoroughly enjoyed.

It appears that small takes were added to get her to make a full length movie. As a fan of Kingsman I am hugely disappointed in The Golden Circle. The plot is weak. The villain is a joke, the foul language is gratuitous, and frankly the movie was a high disappointment. If your a fan of Kingsman, then don't get to excited to see this poor excuse for a sequel. Don't waste your time, wait till it comes on TV so you won't waste your hard earned cash buying a ticket .",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
572,robitussin217,"STUPID exposition and character actions, great action with boring middle SPOILERS",1,2 December 2017,"SPOILERS Loved the beginning action sequence. Not my favorite sort of choreography + cinematography, but there's not much like it, and I always appreciate when you can tell what's happening during cool action sequences, and this has really good hand to hand combat that makes for a truly thrilling action sequence. HOWEVER! This movie also commits the sin of showing someone who is supposed to be good at gun play running into THE MIDDLE of a group of men with automatic weapons, then showing some of those men RUNNING AT this person instead of just shooting him. Nope nope nope. Some of the dialogue is downright dumb because they beat you over the head with stuff that could be shown instead of explained, complete with techy-sounding bullcrap you might hear in a Disney channel cartoon. Plus there's other just boring dialogue when nothing interesting is happening in a long, boring, middle section where I didn't end up caring about the characters. Just felt like I was waiting for ending to see some more action. Finally, when that started, they stopped to kill Merlin in the dumbest way. Also, I hated how Tequila (Tatum) made Merlin look like a child and Eggsy a slightly older child. Never emasculate your baddass main character. They spent the last movie showing Eggsy become a baddass. If Tequila was shown to be Eggsy's equal, that would be showing how baddass Tequila is. Instead, they made Eggsy and Merlin look like chumps. Then, they made Eggsy look more like an idiot with like 88 lines showing how he didn't trust Harry when he was suspicious of Whiskey. Even when Whiskey ATTACKED Harry, Eggsy attributed toward a brain glitch. Baddass card revoked. TL;DR- Too little great action, too much stupid action, stupid characters, too boring, loved Elton John in this, but everyone else's talent was squandered.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

In contrast to Samuel L Jackson, I found Julienne Moore's villain Poppy downright terrifying. Kingsman Golden Circle is very fast-paced, and packed with action.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have quite that same punch the second time around. Unlike the first movie, which centers on Eggsy's growth from street punk to gentleman spy, there is no growth in The Golden Circle. We don't get to learn more about who the characters are, the spy world doesn't get expanded on, and there's no ramifications from the previous movie that gets resolved.But none of that matters as long as we have a lot of fun, am I right? Unfortunately, this movie can't do that either. While there are plenty of nifty gadgets and weapons, there's really nothing that we haven't seen in the last movie already, and the action scenes aren't nearly as technically impressive or memorable as the bar fight or church scene from the last movie.So is it a bad movie? Not at all. It's just boring and everything feels rehashed, and ultimately isn't really worth your time if you've already seen the first movie.Read my full review at http://tinseltownreviews.blogspot.com/2017/09/kingsman-golden-circle- 2017-same-thing.html",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
576,mindigo-03361,It's Trump Bashing that's the real Story of Kingman,6,9 October 2017,"Apart from Colin Firth's pedestrian acting, Elton John's embarrassing cameo, and long fighting scenes made boring by their implausibility, rarely has a film been so clear in its political agenda, namely to justify a place in the American psyche to bring down the American president. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is Hollywood propaganda 2017 style. Its subplot answers to the Alt Left's wish fantasy of having Hillary Clinton be President. The plot involves arch drug dealer Poppy Adams (played by Julianne Moore) selling her drugs: cocaine, heroin, meth, etc., to millions of dope heads around the world. She puts a toxin in her products that will eventually kill users off. When people start getting visibly sick, she makes a deal with the President to deliver the antidote to cure them all. Her deal also stipulates the President make all illegal drugs legal and make Poppy the head of the international drug consortium. The President agrees on paper but, in fact, he wants all drug users dead. So he starts imprisoning the fiends, recreational users as well, so they will croak. His Chief of Staff, Fox (meant to represent Hillary) also starts showing symptoms of drug use. Ha! She too is put inside a cage to kick the bucket. Two Kingsmen, played by deadweight Firth and lightweight Taron Egerton, eventually knock off Poppy, distribute the antidote through drones, and save the world's users. The film ends with the President being impeached, and the Hillary character Fox being instated as President. Worth noting is the persona of the arch villain Jack Daniels. He is a cowboy, non-drug user from the South – and like one the many country music fans in Las Vegas that were witness to the tragedy. Were Jack real, he would have most certainly voted for Trump.The film thus is meant to appeal to Clinton's supporters. It adds to the call in American media to impeach Trump. It states that Trump will tread on the alternative left's ""right"" to use recreational and hard drugs. And it offers up as its final feel good moment, the Hillary character being depicted as President.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Little tip though, don't take the 11 year old boy like we did: one scene involves a little bit of ""digital penetration"" which was a sort of hidden from view.... but not quite. Was an important plot point but the boy had to hide his eyes!!! Loved Julianne Moores bad girl, Colin Firth cool as always, Eggsy really had me on his side and the introduction of the Yank's could have ruined things but didn't. Was handled well and with plenty of good humour, avoiding all the cheap shots (mostly). This is a movie to go and enjoy for the imagination and innovation that's been put into it.

578,dangreen-44045,A rarely successful sequel....,8,24 September 2017,"Wow...start to finish. I loved this movie. I am huge fan of Vaughn's films, and this one did not disappoint. Pros:1. Matthew Vaughn is getting more confident with the cut-edited action scene shooting style, and he uses this to great effect in this film. While there are some parts where it's a bit too shaky, I could always figure out what was going. He zooms in during key parts uses slow-motion sparingly, making the scenes feel visceral and chaotic. Superbly choreographed and well-thought out.2. Story-telling is done well in this film. We are given a large amount of back-story telling that helps us feel more connected to the characters. They are fleshed out, and the whole cast is more emotionally connected to the world around them. Twist with Tequila near the end is a great plot device.3. Over the top action is a staple for Vaughn, and I was worried he would not be able to top the church scene from the first Kingsmen. He managed to pack in an number of intense fight / peril scenes in this movie that blew me away.Cons:1. Pacing is kind of an issue here. There is a large gap in the middle of the film that is dedicated almost entirely to story- telling with little action. Some of it feels unnecessary in a film that is made mostly to entertain.2. Underused characters is something I also have an issue with. Channing Tatum was hugely publicized for his role in the film. The guy literally had 2 memorable scenes. Outch. And Roxy? Forget it.Besides that, awesome, worth every penny, extremely entertaining, can't wait for the next one. Keep it up Vaughn.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Douchiest movie I have seen since the Entourage movie. I was expecting that from Entourage, I was not expecting it from this movie after enjoying the first one. It was mind blowing how lowest common denominator this movie is in its humor, plot, dialogue, and acting. Is it trying to ironically over stylized, stupid, cliche, and mindless?

Nobody would survive the scenarios presented in the first movie, so how could they in the second? Julianne Moore plays an excellent villain. She has that Kathy Bates from Misery quality of evil. She won't win best actress, but she was great along with the rest of the cast.There will definitely be a sequel(s), and a definite spin-off now they brought in Channing Tatum who could do well in his own series.

It's supposed to be fun, entertaining, and stir an emotional response that is energetic. Makes you go ""Whoa that was cool - howd they do that ?"" The actors have lent their talents to a project, gave an amazing performance in the role they were chosen for, and shared it with us for our enjoyment. I laugh at the negative comments and reviews as they try to fathom and interpret what has gone into the making of this film or any film for that matter. My opinion, and it is just that, is highlighted with questions and answers; is it an entertaining film? Yes - Does it immerse the viewer into a world that represents the story? Yes - Do the actors and directors and all that are involved take us on a journey into their interpretation of the script that was written? Yes - was it an awesome film? Yep - I saw stunts and gadgets and toys I wanted for myself all through out the movie and the story was fun and exciting and fast paced. I hope that the people involved with this project ignore the negative rants of people clearly dissatisfied with their own choices of entertainment and being their negativity over to good movies and try and ruin it for everyone else.

Good actors like this must get a lot of suggestions with both great stories and money to earn. It is also a mystery why producers and directors choose scripts like this making movies from when there must be so many to choose from. The action scenes and fight scenes are OK and well made. So if you are someone that just watch movies to see this go ahead. I think the moral of the story is that if you are a drug user you should continue being addicted.

The film is very action-packed, but the story never delivers the emotional ""punches"" or emotional engagement which the original delivered. Not once did I get the ""wow, that's cool!"" feeling watching this film. I did, however, experience the exact opposite and cringed several times as the story unfolded and very obvious situations and very cliché actions were shown. And when you add in the gratuitous use of a certain famous musician, and all the obvious cowboy/American stereotypes, then you may come to realize that you're being led down a very shallow path. Additionally you're coping with watching lots of wildly unbelievable tech, and it adds to how the film ends up quite a bit cheesy. If there is a third film, I hope the producers really give us a better story and less CGI. This second installment was too much eye candy and not enough story and emotional engagement.

597,dennerdaniel,"Not too shabby, but Kingsman 1 was just better",7,27 October 2019,"The film I'm reviewing is called Kingsman 2; the Golden Circle. It's an action movie, as you might have guessed from the title. The whole film was directed by Matthew Vaughn. It was shot in multiple cities, for example in London, Italy and etc. The star roles of the movie were played by Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Taron Egerton. (nickname in the film: Eggsy)
It's the sequel to Kingsman 1; the Secret Service.
The story starts in England and continues with the plot of the first movie. The main characters recovered from the last film and are motivated for the upcoming mission. For no reason one guy, I won't tell the name due to spoiler alert, ""came"" back, but he lost his memory. All I can tell is that he was shot in the last movie and somehow he survived. Neither was he able to remember the names of his mates, nor was he receptive. At the beginning of the story the struggle was real for the other agents, yet they managed to handle it professionally. The baddies in the story are some drug dealers, who want to rule the world with the help of their drugs. But they won't succeed and the reason why is Eggsy.
Personally I enjoyed the film, it was action packed, well made and funny. I loved and still love the scene with Merlin singing ""Take me Home, Country Roads"".

600,albertding-64468,Three successful tips,6,26 October 2020,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a 2017 action spy comedy film. It is a sequel to the previous one Kingsman: The Secret Service, which is based on the comic book series Kingsman. Among this movie, there are three aspects I will comment, the casts, plot and the work of production.In this movie, there are many potential actors and actresses participating in the performance. Among those actors and actresses, there are some big stars too. For example, Colin Firth and Julianne Moore. Both big stars get many kinds of awards in their career.The plot is very simulating especially the fighting scene, which makes me feel like I was the person in the movie. If a person likes to see some stimulating scenes, this movie is a good choice.There are three work production companies in this film, Twentieth Century Fox, TSG Entertainment and Marv Films. After shooting this film, the director of the film announced that there will be another sequel of Kingsman and the third one maybe the last one of this series.An item has good and bad, so do this film. There are some disadvantages in this film that many fans cannot agree with it. So, do I. For instance, the first one is Eggsy did not check the robotic arm for a date, the second one is Rosie died easily and the agent's address is super easy to steal and Brought a minesweeper umbrella, but still stepped on a landmine etc.To sum up, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a little bit below the audience's expectations compare to Kingsman: The Secret Service but this one has its own advantages too.

601,merlinolaf,This movie amplifies almost everything,9,24 March 2021,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle amplifies almost everything. Why? Let me explain.
The runtime doubles, the fight scene quality amplifies, the ridiculousness also amplifies, the cast, all that. But some things did not, see, there are things I hated, and things I liked. The things I liked, they somehow were able make their fight sequences better than the last, though the Church Fight still impresses me, I can argue that the Final Fight in this movie is better. I think the plot is decent, character development, er... exists. I also like that we got to see more of Merlin. It was good to see Eggsy and Harry fighting side by side. The things I didn't like was the extended cameo with Elton John, we didn't need it, and it was ridiculous. And the plot with the president, again, we didn't really need it, what they should've done was make the president in the neutral, trying to fix it, by not signing the agreement with Poppy, because, he's a bad politician, but don't make him a psychopathic masochistic maniac. Speaking of Poppy, she was an okay villain, nothing top-tier, but I really would've liked if she wasn't some 2D villain. She could have a backstory, why she's doing what she does, a monologue like what Agent Whiskey did could've worked. Whiskey was alright, I don't have a particular opinion on him. I could go on all day about this movie, but I'm not, and I wont.

608,Venniels,As golden as the first one?,7,2 October 2017,"After the Astonishing success of Kingsman: the Secret Service, Matthew Vaughn is back with a sequel that is more explosive than ever. This 2 hour and 22 minute movie does not leave a lot of room for taking a breath, as the action scenes follow up on each other in a quick and bombastic fashion. But is it all gold for this movie or doesn't it live up to it's predecessor? Kingsman: the Golden Circle is about Egsy (Taron Egerton), a young English man who, after saving the world in the first installment, has now got a more relaxed life with his girlfriend, who happens to be the princess of Sweden. When the Kingsman base gets blown into the sky. the Kingsman are looking for help from their American Equivalent, the Statesman (Played by Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal, Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry). The two teams join forces to withstand the evil plans of Drug seller and mastermind Poppy (played by Juliana Moore), whom is set to blackmail governments to destroy the world if she doesn't get immunity for her deeds. To make things more complicated, Harry Hart (played by Colin Firth), Egsy's mentor who got killed in the first installment, is revealed to be alive, although he isn't entirely ready for battle. Taron Egerton (Egsy) still has his talent for dialogue and actions sequences, as seen in the movies opening scenes in the middle of London during a gruesome car chase. Vaughn's typical usage of shots and camera tricks cannot pass by unnoticed as it enhances the feeling of stress and tension. From the start this movie gripes you and does not really let go in terms of actions set pieces and exhilarating fight scenes. The American Statesman really add a new dimension to this world, as their approach is different than that of the Kingsman's. Bridges, who plays head of the statesman Champagne, and Berry, who plays Ginger, both have fun roles, albeit without a lot of screen time. Their presence isn't much more as a few nice cameos. Tatum has a little more to say and do but can't be considered much more than a minor side role as well. The real spotlight regarding the statesman is set on Pedro Pascal. The actor, known for his great roles in Game of Thrones, really is a rising star and his acting abilities can be seen in this movie as well. His character is the best and wisest agent of the Statesman. He might even be better than Harry Hart was, and this accumulates in nice little scenes of interaction and even tension between the two. Moore's villain Poppy is more weird than scary. Poppy lives deep in a Cambodian Jungle, decorated as a 50's village complete with barbershop, old fashioned theater and classical style cafeteria. She never gets frightening or truly evil and her character is not really that interesting after all. Colin Firth brings a lot of heart in this movie with his portrayal of Harry Hart, whom suffers from memory loss and doesn't recognize Egsy. Together with Egerton, he makes those scenes rather emotional, which is a good thing. When the memory loss is fixed, he becomes his old self again. A transition that is well played and clearly noticeable acting wise. Although all these characters individually are interesting enough to carry a movie, Kingsman merely suffers from all their presence. The mixture of all this characters are promising but most of these new introduces don't lead to an interesting outcome. Channing, Berry and Bridge's characters are barely used, and could've been cut out without being missed. Their addition feels ambitious, and might have been meant for another sequel's set-up, but was not needed at all. Moreover, as all these characters seek to find their spot in this movie's plot, it gets even more difficult for the viewer to follow all the characters motivations. Resulting in a chaotic mess of piled characters who don't really have to say a lot. Another flaw which irritated my was the anticlimactic ending of the movie. This is more of an personal issue I have, as I like grand scale, epic final battles. As said before, the first 2 hours of this movie was overwhelming in terms of action set pieces. The last 20 minutes, AKA the final fight, really isn't. It's meant to be more personal, heaving Egsy fight with Poppy, but it doesn't really work out. I might be over comparing this movie to the first one, which ended with the whole world fighting each other and a big shootout in the villains lair, but that's what made the first movie so great. I was grand and spectacular, and did not take itself serious at all. It was a spoof of the James Bond spy genre, and did a great work being that. That's what I missed in the sequel. Although most of the movie's action scenes are bigger and better than ever, I have the feeling this movie misses out of what made the first one so great, being an over the top parody of the old spy genre. Kingsman: the Golden Circle assembled a great list of A- actors, but most of their characters, especially the Statesman, are wasted and don't get a lot of screen time. Special recognition to Pedro Pascal, Colin Firth and Taron Egerton, who give this movie just an extra spark of interaction and chemistry. This movie has a lot of heart but is mostly focused on action and tension. It is nowhere as good as the first one was, but if you're looking for a nice blockbuster to watch with some friends, this is the one. (If you can, please go see it in IMAX, the larger screen and enhances the experience like never before!)",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

622,kieranvisram,"Entertaining, but a few major problems",7,13 October 2017,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle left a few story arcs to be desired. Firstly the movie relied heavily on CGI and more shorter fight scenes would've been better just as the first movie had. The spectacle of those scenes in The Secret Service is what made the film what it is, a great piece of an action spy movie.Secondly the death of Roxy was a surprise considering she is a good character and a capable Kingsman the same as if not more than Eggsy. Therefore, the fact that she was killed of at the beginning was very disappointing to see. She should've been kept around for the whole movie if not most of it with herself and Eggsy working together as a team. This would have been a brilliant combination to see and would've worked well on screen as we have not seen the character have a fight scene yet. Beginning her back now for the third installment would've be a cop out. Overall a poor decision to kill her offThe realization that Harry Hart was in fact still alive could easily have been left for the third installment as his involvement had little effect to the story. This is where Roxy could have taken his part.The roles of Agent Tequila and Ginger Ale played by Channing Tatum and Halle Berry respectively were great, hopefully they're not just one off extended cameos. Here's hoping they have a larger part in the next movie and this was a mere setup.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

The sequels had become the typical spy film the first one mocked: the predictable plot, corny dialogues, and verbose villain. The action scenes are still entertaining but it gets old because of the long run-time, and while it's nice to see so many great cameo in this film, there is simply not enough time to develop each character, leaves audience hard to connect with.

631,robin-walton98,The Most Fun I Have Had in a Long Time,7,20 September 2017,"This film is simply pure entertainment. Mathew Vaughn has made another great movie. It begins just as the last film ends with an impressive if not opportunistic car chase in the Taxi throughout London ending with Eggsy swimming through the London sewers all so that he can see his mates in Camden one last time and set the drug fuelled story of this film rolling. This film doesn't bring anything new in terms of plot direction or a developed baddie with meaningful motivations but these aren't what made Kingsman: The Secret Service great and they sure aren't what made this great either.It's brilliant because the script did not lose its unique British vernacular that set the first film apart from so many other spy comedies. It's still a British film dominated by British acting, I was surprised how little Channing Tatum was in it given how prevalent he was in the trailer, and in fact takes small pops at America throughout. This film will only hold out as long as America can laugh at its stupid stereotypes, which are meant to be funny for all, like us Bits have to in most Blockbuster movies. Granted the CGI was glaringly obvious throughout the film and was slightly painful in certain scenes, but it allowed the film to create these brilliantly imagined and engaging action scenes in which the first film based it success and word of mouth upon. Without it, the action scenes would be gun fights like we have seen hundreds of times before. Although there is no scene on the same level as the church scene in the first film, the Diner scene at the end does come close with Pedro Pascal's ""skipping rope"" as a weapon adding something new and slightly sickening as he cuts through one Italian guard like a hot knife would through butter. Finally, this being a year for big failed celebrity cameos in movie and TV (Ed Sheeran in GOT and David Beckham in King Arthur in particular), Elton John in this film is hilarious and plays a much bigger role than I expected, which I was all for seeing just how funny he was with the scene of him and Colin Firth killing the Robot Dog being my personal favourite. If you take this movie too seriously with some again comparing it to 007, you will be disappointed as of course it's not going to have the same class or sophistication as Fleming's novels. That is what makes it different as it does not try to copy that or make a mockery of it either. The Kingsman films now stand on their own.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

634,ewoutro,A passable but mediocre sequel.,6,26 September 2017,"Right off the bat, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a tough act to follow. It would take a small miracle to top it.The Golden Circle is not that miracle.Think about what made the first movie so entertaining. The dry wit, amazing action sequences, endearing characters, original story, even a badass soundtrack. It was totally out of the blue, and everyone ate it up. The Golden Circle suffers from ""sequel syndrome"", where it takes pretty much everything that worked in the first, and amps it up to 11. Imagine taking a sports car and making it go impractically fast, just to outdo the previous model. Try driving it, and you'll probably just end up with a sad mess. That's what happens here. ""Oh, you liked the church fight scene? Well here's three more versions of that!"" ""Oh you laughed at the kinda uncomfortable sex scene? Well here, have one that's waaaay more uncomfortable, and pretty creepy!"" The film feels like two hours of the same stuff, watered down to the point where it's no longer entertaining to watch.This movie tries so hard to be bigger and flashier than its predecessor that it loses track of what made the first one good- spectacle in moderation. Everything in this film is HUGE. Some people might like it, but I certainly didn't. It loses the charm, the personal and intimate touch. The stakes are blown to such enormous proportions that they become unbelievable and pretty silly. Not only that, but despite the insurmountable odds, there was rarely a moment where it felt like the protagonists were actually in peril. They always seemed to keep their cool and take out every villain they encountered. In the first one they were actually overwhelmed, and narrowly avoided defeat. In this, they even have time for silly quips and one-liners as the world ends around them.The characters themselves are oddly detached from the first movie. Eggsy in particular has lost his blunt but endearing personality, and acts way more arrogant and mean-spirited. There are some moments of genuine empathy for him, and then he brutally murders a guy. Charming... Julianne Moore's villain is curious and could be genuinely interesting, but she has the depth of a sheet of paper. There's almost no interaction between her and the heroes, and whenever we do see her it's through some unnecessary sub-plot that's only there to remind us she exists. She tries to pull off the kooky eccentricity of Sam L. Jackson in the previous film, but it comes off as unrealistic and goofy. She'd be more at home as an Adam West Batman villain.Colin Firth's Galahad is back, thanks to one of the laziest Deus-ex-Machina's in recent films. He doesn't do much, and half the time he's on screen he's just stumbling around trying not to die. Seriously, he went from being this elite super-agent, to this bumbling fool who takes a backseat to Eggsy.The story is bland, over-the-top and generic. You've probably already seen it in the first Kingsman, and most superhero films. There's not much more to say because there isn't much to it.In the end, while it's not terrible, it's not great either. It tries too hard to be the first one but bigger, and loses much of the appeal and potential it had. I'm rather disappointed.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

From the beginning Taron Egerton role as the loyal and sweet boyfriend kind of annoyed me because I couldn't really believe it. However, the first hour is very entertaining and keeps you wondering what is gonna happen next, how will everything connect. Sadly, it all stops when Harry accuses Whiskey of being a double agent, and that's when I started to feel like I had wasted my money. Some of the scenes try to be very explicit in various ways approaching the scenes as a satire but that also makes the story line lose it's power and the engagement of the audience. I decided to see it on the theater mainly because of the action sequences and intricate shots and believe me I wasn't disappointed Kingsman knows that it is its best asset and takes advantage of it as well as the construction of the characters that seem so unique. I give it a 6 mainly because it's writing and story line, it's the perfect example of a cliché with very good special effects, action sequences and comedy, it just doesn't impress o innovate in any kind of way.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Also the English charm is obviously alluring. And well, I can't find any of those characteristics in this part. The F-word is too overused. I can hear it in every 10 seconds, almost 96 or 97% of the lines. A few times maybe fine, but several times (more like most of the time) is not.Also, Eggsy is not as charming as in The Secret Service. And the part that he has to do ""it"" with Clara to put the tracking device on her is like totally disgusting. A gadget in the form of a condom? What else can they think of? I even thought of leaving the cinema right at that moment. That's totally not very elegant. Galahad this time is not so powerful. Even when he got his memory back, his performance is kind of weak and the sense is just not right. No more confidence and assertiveness in his moves. Really disappointed.The general feel is the movie has been turned to be more sexual, in both characters' lines and movie scenes. Maybe I'm too allured by the 1st part's characters so I came out with these comparisons but still this is much worse than the 1st one.

649,channingmurphyeadygately,Better than the original?,8,20 September 2017,"The action-packed, comedy filled, spy film that has just hit the cinema is a must see! It is a sequel that marvellously continues from the ground breaking 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. Whilst the main antagonist Poppy may not have been as symbolic as Valentine, her sidekick certainly made up for this. The fight scenes were spectacularly done, with numerous sequences that were particularly memorable and whilst none of these were as good as the famous Kentucky Church Fight Scene, all of them displayed a significant level of action, violence and of course bloodshed. Furthermore, the plot itself was fantastic, with many twists which as predictable as they may have been, did not diminish the performance in any way. On the contrary, it enhanced it to incredible standards, with brilliant performances from Taron Egerton, Colin Firth and Mark Strong. This film also produced one of the saddest moments that I have witnessed in a very long time, which made me appreciate the film even more. My only criticism would be the amount of romance in this film which I believed to be rather unnecessary. However, this was made up for by the great deal of comedy that was portrayed by both old and new characters, in levels that greatly exceeded that of the last film, making it even more enjoyable. The film turned out to not be as americanised as the trailer led me to believe, thus displaying the Kingsman characteristics which made the film so brilliant. To conclude, I must admit that this film is one of, if not the best film that has been released all year. In comparison to the first Kingsman film, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is similar in many ways, but the greater amount of comedy, action, unique characters, significant moments and plot development, makes me take the view that the sequel is indeed better than the original, a rare occasion in the film industry, but something which I must congratulate Matthew Vaughn for achieving. I certainly recommend everyone who has watched the first film to head straight to the cinema, you're in for a treat!",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
650,TheSquDeactive,"While a step down from the original, it's still worth your time.",7,1 October 2017,"I don't think anyone expected the original 'Kingsman' to be as big and enjoyable as it was and now the sequel has come along for a fun if familiar journey.First off I have to commend the strong performances of Taron Egerton, Mark Strong and Pedro Pascal. These three by far had the most entertaining scenes and lines throughout the film with strong character developments from all three. You grow to have strong emotions for each of them as they have their stories explored.The movie itself brings back the incredible use of long shots in action scenes and they are as enjoyable as before. However, the techniques were noticeably very dodgy during the initial action scene with some quite obvious use of CGI, so much so it enters 'uncanny valley' territory.Another criticism is the under-use of both Jeff Bridges and especially Julianne Moore, both of whom seem incredibly intriguing and have a lot to offer the story. Instead we are given an honestly quite weak and annoying performance by Colin Firth, who was arguably the best part of the first film. Edward Holcroft also returns to this film as the Kingsman reject from the first, Charlie. He is the worst part of the film for me. Not spoiling anything, he felt like he was shoehorned into the plot and could've been replaced by pretty much anyone.The movie itself does however set itself a bit further away from the original, entering new territory and not just wallowing in the success of the first. The movie has to be greatly commended for this as well as having a lot of story lines from the first that are greatly continued and wrapped up.Overall, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' receives a rating of Good from me and is definitely worth a watch, especially if you enjoyed the first. The movie can feel a bit overlong and some scenes and actors just seem to be there for the sake of being there and maybe could've been edited out, but overall it did everything it needed to and we are now guaranteed a third movie is this honestly very well done franchise.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

For this movie I raised my expectations high because the first one was excellent. It included action, comedy and anything that counts for one good movie. All of my expectations was satisfied and even beyond. I liked the second movie more than the first one. There was plenty of everything that I was expected - fight scenes, humour, drama etc. And most of all I think the cast was perfect. The were a lot of ""new"" actors (""new"" because they were not in the first movie) which I like, for example: Pedro Pascal, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore etc. That's why I gave rating 10 to Kingsman: The Golden circle.

It was like eating dinner, the first was the appetizer with the sequel being the main course. Now, while the movie wasn't as good as the first, it's still pretty good. It did enough to keep me entertained for a good 2 hours and got me to laugh, and cry quite a bit. You really don't need to see the first one to get what's going on fully, you can piece it together well enough, but the second one is far more enjoyable if you've seen the first one.

656,matheushm,Kingsman: The Golden Circle is one of the worst movies of the year so far.,2,24 September 2017,"What I thought of Kingsman: The Golden Circle The humor was predictable and cringe worthy, the plot minus well be nonexistent, they barely develop/use the villain. All the characters that were cool in the first movie were given nothing to do. And the new characters that they do introduce are so irrelevant that they minus well not be there. There is only one new character that is given anything to do, but he is so obviously a secondary villain waiting to be revealed that he should just have been a secondary villain to begin with. There was also a bunch of attempts at shock humour attempt, but those were just more obnoxious than actually shocking. The action is also not really well done, because there are times where you just can't really tell what's happening. The movie keeps zooming in unnecessarily because I guess the director thought that looked cool.

I agree that certain choices about characters being present or absent were probably suboptimal and as far as character development goes, it almost seems like a bridge for future movies to come. Ultimately, as the old saying goes: ""you can't be everybody's darling,"" and while many of us would have probably gone in a different direction with the second movie, it is definitely satisfying if you leave your expectations outside the movie theatre and just enjoy it, the way it's meant to be enjoyed.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

I understand that people like some excitement, cool fight scenes and modern fighting gadgets and tools, but these violent scenes didn't have anything to do with that. We are all aware that movie industry has a huge huge impact on people's thoughts, mental patterns and how they live and view the world.

This movie is (like the first) totally over the top and does not takes it self to seriously, this makes for a perfect blend. The easy stereotypes (this movie relies heavy on) works and just sets up the universe in a more bigger and brighter way for the future. The movie itself made me feel like a boy again, but at the same time critics our current society (like the first) in a glorious & humorous way.

Also, the action scenes (of which there were many) were executed beautifully! It was definitely a fun, action-packed ride from beginning to end! Not to mention there was some sick use of dark humor combined with ultra graphic (yet tasteful) violence. It's definitely a rare occurrence that I find a sequel better than the first installment.I took away one star as I thought the villains' final scenes and lasting impressions were slightly anti-climatic.

673,fictionrphq,"brilliant, but flawed",10,3 October 2017,"Eggsy Unwin makes this franchise. Taron Egerton is a stunning find in every way — an exceedingly handsome, gifted young actor who becomes his character. Hollywood ought to keep a firm grip on this gem of a rising star.Contrary to what some have been opining, I found that the script was strong in terms of character development — that is, when it did decide to develop its characters. The problem lay in the film's rushed pace and uneven focus. Most of its action scenes are imaginative, so to speak; masterful; and very enjoyable, but ultimately rather dissatisfying after so many in a row. Although The Golden Circle is longer than its predecessor, I was left craving more and feeling as though time flew by. The Secret Service was considerably better-structured. This isn't to say, however, that The Golden Circle isn't worth watching. I recommend it wholeheartedly, and that time flew by as I watched it is largely a compliment.Again, the character writing is strong. Eggsy has among the most compelling arcs and characterization in modern mainstream cinema, notable considering what sort of film this is (and tries to be). (On that note, the presence of a few ill-advised gags baffle me, with special mention going to the cannibalism one. You can tell the writer/s is/are capable of more judiciousness, as well as superior execution.) Unfortunately, the action scenes are focused on far more than the characterization*. The rest of the cast, i.e. Merlin (Mark Strong), Harry Hart (Colin Firth), and each of the Statemen, are all given many interesting facets; but these are not explored much, and certain members are underused. Mark Strong was fantastic (and unexpectedly funny) as he brought even greater humanity and complexity to his role. With no disrespect intended towards Firth as an actor, The Golden Circle would've benefited from not having Harry return. (There were positives in his performance.) Pedro Pascal is entertaining, reliable support. His chemistry with Egerton is excellent, and he (spoiler?) would've been a nice permanent replacement for Hart. Halle Berry gave a strong performance, in my opinion. Underutilized, surely, but convincing, subtle. I look forward to more of Ginger, provided there's a Kingsman 3. Julianne Moore's characterization was, to my puzzlement, shallow; but she does well with the material she'd been handed. Moore's also entertaining, but fascinates markedly less as Samuel Jackson did when he played Kingsman's villain.*The shift in focus is understandable, although not my preference. The majority of moviegoers, particularly in countries like mine, would very much choose rapid-fire action in a stream over dialogue- oriented scenes (especially if the movie isn't dubbed from English!). Still, they could've struck a better balance. The cutting-down was probably a major factor.Brilliant. Has its flaws, of course. I hope there's a part three, but they should work on issues.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

683,martinmazechen-62918,Visual Stimuli OR Ethical Question,6,2 December 2017,"Admittedly, the visual stimuli was still as awesome as the previous episode, from the scene at the beginning of the movie. The sense of humor also remained throughout the plot. Just because of the aforementioned affairs, the director probably neglected to cope with the details I suppose, which triggered a couple of questions in my mind.First of all, the problem is about the drugs. I am not an American so I cannot stand on American position exclusively to judge it. But since it is a movie that is published around the world simultaneously, it is indispensable to consider other people's perspective on drugs. Human beings are indeed lives but when they break the law to do something illegal, don't they need to be punished, at least to receive the supposed sanction? The behavior of the president might be too extreme to care about people's lives. But to some extent, he is doing the thing he supposes it is proper. Even though his assistant, that woman who also takes drugs, mentioned the possibility that some people may use it for medical purpose, the movie doesn't contain such relative information. Instead, people who are infected by the fatal illness include the princess who took it to escape her inner frustration to Eggsy, the boy as a friend of Eggsy who took it for fun in the party which the boy's friend actually reminded him"" I told you the thing ain't no good to you"", and the woman as president's secretary who took drugs to support her working condition, All the aforementioned circumstances do not rely on drugs independently. There are substitutes to drugs for their purposes. Should the director really think about whether it is worth to record a film to save those people as the main content line that leads to the end?Apart from the ethical question, Whiskey's death was more weird and serious, which I am sure the film producer probably fail to consider one more time. In my opinion, both of Kingsman and Statesman regarded this issue too extremely: Eggsy and Harry want to save the world and be the hero so they have to got the code to distribute the antidote; while just because two people who take drugs, Whiskey cannot endure every person who takes drugs survive. As a result, they fight and eventually, Eggsy and Harry PUT WHISKEY INTO THE MEAT GRINDER! He is their partner after all and saves the other two lives. All the things occurring so far don't deserve a negotiation that we don't have to kill each other and the death is the only outcome. What astonishes me in the end is Champagne's attitude: he lost a skillful agent but didn't have comments or even a little emotion for this affair. Whiskey, no matter how stupid his thoughts were, is his close friend at least.Those are the two ethical problems that this movie failed to convey. It is less impressive than the last episode.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

690,jennifsulliv,Three words: Sir Elton John,8,26 December 2017,"Is this a pretty ridiculous sequel? Yes. Do I think it works for Kingsman and this sequel? Yes. General:
The Kingsman series is fueled by the promise to be over-the-top, using a formula of action and oddness. Acknowledging that, this installment takes the mix to the next level. Kingsman takes a break from the generic evil stereotypes and shows that even neurotic messes can be rather dangerous.Pros:
Taron Egerton - need I even say more? Also, Sir Elton John is HILARIOUS. Seriously, his ridiculousness is perfectly fitted for the movie and I laughed out loud during every one of his scenes. Saying the line ""Fuck off... or I'll fuck you up"" while outfitted in a very brightly-colored feather number is just glorious. The backstage pass offer to Harry is wonderful as well.Cons:
Honestly? I kind of hated the Statesman. Yes, this is almost certainly because I dislike the American stereotype of burly, whiskey-drinking, machismo types but the movie made them unbearable.

697,gilmanjerome,Shows how far Hollywood has sunk,1,2 January 2018,Shows how far off Hollywood is and the people are in the business. Everyone does drugs you can smoke crack or meth recreationally. The best part off the movie was when the President said let the junkies burn. Will never watch another Kingsman. Director must do drugs it the only way he could think the movie was any good. I cant belive the actors went along with this stupid story line. show me the money is all anyone thinks about anymore. Saw the movie for free and I still thought they owed me my money back. This is why my family doesn't go to the movies anymore.,Kingsman - The Golden Circle
698,tehorangepuff,"It's not a serious spy movie, but still worth a watch.",7,19 January 2018,"Spy movies are usually movies with prominent, confident heroes and over the top and weird villains. The concept is silly but so captivating. This movie just takes that formula and makes it more comedy based, leading to levels of almost parody. The comedy can be very hit or miss. I laughed at a few jokes, but not all of them. I loved the action scenes and their spectacle, magnified with the Statesmen's new gadgets and Poppy's weird gadgets. Poppy herself was not nearly as good as the villain of the first movie, Valentine, but is still a good enough villain, even if she is quite cartoonish. The movie has a strong beginning by pulling the rug out from under you, a mediocre middle with some buildup but mostly just filler and static character development, which leads into the last part of the movie in Poppyland, which is honestly the best part of this movie. The beginning fight scene and the fight at the very end with Whiskey where amazing. However the mediocre middle part was kind of a letdown, and a lot of the subplots were either A. Never resolved and forgotten (like Harry's psychosis or the entirety of Tequila's character) or just don't mean anything. (Like the president or Elton John.) The only new character we got that did anything of importance were Whiskey, Poppy, and Ginger Ale, and 2 of them are dead villains. Also a lot of retconning was done with the last movie with the revival of Harry and the killing of every other major character from the last movie except for Harry and Eggsy. Is it a perfect movie? No. But it's still worth a watch if you like spectacle and aren't a serious person.Pros:
Good fight choreography
Great actors
The soundtrack is pretty good, but not super memorable apart from the main theme and the Elton John songs.
CG is pretty good
Beginning and end were very memorable and captivating.Cons:
Hit or miss comedy
Mediocre middle
New characters were underutilized.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
699,drool-38432,Was there a writers strike?,5,22 January 2018,"I liked the first movie but this was total nonsense. Was there a writers strike, did they make it up while shooting this garbage?Here ar my reasons. I walked out of the cinema.1) Bad Cgi and more bad cgi2) Nonsensical character motivations3) Lazy writing (it was like a 8 year-old wrote the script)4) Badly done action camouflaged with silly music5) Bad production design",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
700,dmongosa,Lame over the top poppy-cock sequel,5,27 January 2018,"Having really enjoyed the first Kingsmen movie, I had high hopes for an equally entertaining sequel. Not sure if the script writers were trying to make a sequel closer to Austin Powers than James Bond, but they failed painfully in both genres. The action scenes were so over the top and ridiculous. 
Joining the original cast are even more star power costars, Channng Tatum, Julianne Moore, Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges. Tatum is more of a cameo appearance and Julianne Moore's character is a lame female version of Dr. Evil. It's painful to see her act in this role that's so beneath her acting talent. However it's still not as painfully lame than all of Sir Elton John's scenes in this turd fest, especially his musical fight finale.
 If it wasn't for the two original Kingsmen, Colin Firth and Taron Egerton, I wouldn't have given this poppy-cock sequel even the 5 out of 10 stars.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
701,mostlyshirley,"Shoulda, coulda been better",2,29 January 2018,"Right from the start, the film disappointed. The below-par CGI with the opening car chase was the start of the downhill slide for me.I guess I can only sum this up and say that the script just ruined the whole exerience. The first was so, so good that I thought the second would be equally so. Sadly more time was needed to be spent before rushing this instalment out. Not even the acting, excellent thought it was, could save this movie. Oh and Elton John, he was awesome and totally unexpected.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
702,arnarhugih,Great Movie!,10,4 February 2018,I love this movie and I enjoyed so much! Also I was dead whenever Elton John was In a scene. Recommend it 100%! I want a another movie!,Kingsman - The Golden Circle
703,porompalom,I had to read 3 Junji Ito stories just to get it out of my mind,2,9 February 2018,"I don't know whether the actors knew what they had signed up for. Many of them did their best against the obviously bad script, their effort is appreciated. Other than that it is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. This movie is tasteless on so many levels. For the most part, it is childish, self serving bull***t thrown at our faces. Out of its lane, big budget blockbuster dragged down to toilet humour and a mountain of polt devices. No, thanks.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
704,mozartarchilla,Couldn't watch it to the end,3,15 February 2018,"The movie felt pretty stupid and forced and then right after the villain says her goal is to get all drugs legalized (?) they break it to Fox News reporting on some world event, like they are a legitimate news network. At this point I realized I'm watching right-wing propaganda and had to turn it off immediately.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
705,apwells,Don't understand the hate.,10,4 April 2018,"Having watched the film multiple times I've had just as much fun as I have with the first, and the first is a masterpiece. I'll break the review down into two parts. The story and the action.Story:
Eggsy leaves the Kingsman shop late at night after some hard work. He encounters Charlie Hesketh, a minor villain from the first film, who he then gets in a fight with. He discovers that Charlie has a robotic arm now and eventually sends him through the windscreen of his taxi after his driver, Pete, I believe, is tragically killed by Charlie. Charlie leaves the arm behind and orders his henchmen to follow Eggsy. After entering Hyde Park Eggsy blows them up and uses the taxi as a submarine to get to a hiding spot away from the police. Eggsy goes home to his friend, Brandon's, birthday party where he says he's meeting Princess Tilde's parents the next night. Yes the girl from the end of the first film is back. I see this as one of the first major points of criticism, and I just don't get it. It's giving it more of an identity than just being a James Bond spoof. Everyone says that he should be with someone else because that's what James Bond does. It's stupid. Anyway, Brandon is dogsitting for Eggsy the next night when he discovers Eggsy's study, which is the same one as Harry's from the last movie, but all of the old newspapers are taken down as Eggsy is starting a new collection. Brandon discovers the guns that Eggsy keeps in there and the glasses, another pair of which Eggsy is wearing. Long story short, Eggsy's house blows up, as does that of every other Kingsman agent, killing the new Merlin and Roxy. Eggsy then visits the ruins of the old tailor shop and discovers Merlin there. Merlin tells Eggsy about the doomsday protocol, and they go shopping. They go to taste some wine and discover some Statesman brand whiskey. After a toast to their fallen comrades they notice the Kingsman logo on thd back of the bottle. They then go to Kentucky where they meet Tequila, Channing Tatum, and get beaten up by him. They wake up and Tequila tries to get them to tell him who they work for. They don't say anything so he reveals to them that Harry is alive, just missing an eye. He threatens to shoot Harry if they don't tell him who they work for, and just before he does agent Ginger-Ale, Halle Berry, tells him to stop, telling Eggsy and Merlin that they're also a secret intelligence agency. Ginger tells them the story of when they found Harry and saved him before any major damage was done. However, Harry woke up and had mentally regressed a good 20-30 years, to before he'd joined Kingsman and had no clue who anyone was. Eggsy then meets with agent Whiskey, Pedro Pascal, and Champagne, Jeff Bridges. Eggsy and Whiskey go to Glastonbury for a mudic festival and meet Charlie's girlfriend. They need to put a tracker in her, but can only do it through the vagina. Eggsy calls up Tilde to tell her he has to do it before he actually does it, and Tilde gets pissed and breaks things off with him. 
Eggsy then fingers Charlie's girlfriend and puts the tracker in her, leaving it at that. Later, back in Kentucky, Eggsy is having no luck in getting Tilde bsck, but he figures out a way to bring Harry back. It was revealed earlier in the movie that recreating a traumatic event could bring him back. Eggsy buys Harry a dog which is the same breed as Mr. Pickle. He then threatens to shoot the dog, which traumatises Harry to the point where he retires. Then:They go to a bar.
There's a nice callback to the first film.
Harry gets beaten up.
Whiskey saves him.
The Golden Circle appear.
All of the villain's, Poppy's, drugs are infected with dangerous poison.
Poppy has a cure.
Poppy has Elton John.
They go to Italy to get a cure.
Charlie blows up his own girlfriend.
Whiskey ""accidentally"" destroys the cure.
Harry gets suspicious and shoots Whiskey in the face.
Eggsy saves Whiskey with the same Alpha Gel that saved Harry.
They go back to Kentucky.
Eggsy finds out that Tilde is poisoned.
Harry admits to shooting Whiskey.
Eggsy, Harry and Merlin all go to kill Poppy.MAJOR SPOILERS COMING!Eggsy steps on a land mine. Merlin has something that will freeze the mechanism in order to get Eggsy off. He pushes Eggsy off of it and steps onto it so that he can lure Poppy's guards to himself and blow them up, sacrificing himself in the process. He lures them in by singing an absolutely legendary cover of John Denver's Country Roads. As a quick side note, I strongly recommend buying the sountrack on ITunes. It's amazing. Merlin blows up. Eggsy and Harry infiltrate Poppy's base to Saturday Nights by Elton John. They kill Poppy and Charlie and are about to send the cure for the poison out to the world when Whiskey shows up and reveals that he thinks that the people that took the drugs deserve to die as his wife and unborn son were killed by some meth heads. The final fight begins to Word Up by the Boss Hoss. Whiskey gets put into a meat grinder and dies, the cure is sent out to the world, Eggsy proposes to Tilde and they get married, with Elton John at their royal Swedish wedding. The film ends with the reveal that Tequila has helped to rebuild Kingsman and is now an agent for them rather than Statesman.The Action:
There are five major action scenes:
The one in the car at the beginning.
The one in the bar.
The one in Italy.
The first in Poppyland.
The second in Poppyland.The car fight is fairly simple. Set to some great music, with some fairly creative action, such as Eggsy using the car door as a platform as to not hurt himself on the ground and doing a HUGE 360 degree drift at one point, with some bice explosions at the end.The bar scene was a nice callback to the original film, and it was a surprise to see Harry overpowered.The Italy scene had some great ideas and good comedy, such as old men shitting themselves after almost being crushed to death, and a bomb that encases the enemy in some sort of quicly hardening plastic, which killed them.The first Poppyland fight does go on for a bit long, but you do see two people get impaled by some giant scissors, and Elton John beats up a robot dog with a bowling ball.The second fight is awesome too. Whiskey's death was the second most memorable one of the film, right behind Merlin's, and the fight is a perfect final fight, showing how well the Statesman agents are trained, as Eggsy and Harry nearly lost too him.Overall, I really don't understand the hate for this film. It's funny, it's cool as fuck, it was the first film that made me cry since Up, and it's a fun film to watch.10/10 would watch again.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
706,oscarhakkinen,Everything i find wrong with this movie,6,22 April 2018,"What happened? 
was the first movie so good that the sequel just cant live up to it's fame? or did it just have a bad script?First of all. why bring back a character from the first movie when the death of him was such a huge driving point in it. Second. Why did they have to suddenly kill everybody else!? not just the side characters but big the deal main guys. Lancelot, merlin and JB, all of the deaths were meaningless and the movie would have been better off if they survived or only got injured. Third. introduce new people and straight off the bat put them in the freezer because they do drugs behind the scenes.Four. completely not believable characters like the president. what is this? a kids show?Five. Unexplained actions like shooting whisky because he is ""bad"" without giving the viewer a bigger hint that why he is ""bad"".Lightning round! bad guy/woman was boring. the ending was anticlimactic. elton john while being funny had a bit too big of a role. stupid twist ending. the princess that got ten seconds of screentime is now one of the main characters and still more boring than in the first movie. the president puts everyone in cage skyscrapers?! And you spent how much money to make that stupid looking scene?GOOD PARTS!
Merlins death song. trying to make harry regain his memories. new JB. new mister pickles. Merlin in a kingsman suit ready to go out on a mission.introductions to the bad guy/woman. doomsday scene. I mean the list goes on. The problem i personally had was that while some scenes were kick ass the others made the movie feel stupid. like how eggie in the start of the movie got his ass handed to him by charlie but there is no signs of improvements in his skills or talk about how he could hack the arm later in the movie yet in the end when charlie has the upgraded version of the robo fist he miserably fails to beat eggsie. there is no character build on any side and in the end the movie just feels dull and boring. I still think it was a worthwhile movie to watch but i cant say i would watch it again. okay maybe a supercut with the good parts and merlin singing.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle

Despite a fantastic cast, this movie is chock full of lame, over the top, physics defying cg action that actually made me laugh. The dialogue is cheesy and atrocious, so much so that even these great actors couldn't deliver. I know this series is purposefully tongue in cheek, almost like Kill Bill, but nevertheless, it is a shameful disgrace. It is also terribly too long, and I mean terrible. 2 stars only for the quality of the cast. Otherwise it would be 1.",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
712,barry_schwab,Completely contrived plot,1,4 November 2021,"Not remotely believable - even as a fantasy super-villain movie.The characterizations are cardboard, and repeatedly reference the fairly enjoyable original Kingsman movie - unsuccessfully. It has the usual cookie-cutter villains, but the circumstances are so unbelievable that it is impossible to get absorbed in the plot line. And the idea of suddenly introducing a heretofore-unknown American contingent - much better financed and with far greater resources - goes against the whole concept of the gentleman ""Agents"" in the (presumably) United Kingdom - based organization.Perhaps they were going down the path of the ""middle"" James Bond films - Sir Roger Moore (an otherwise excellent actor) may have been closer to the kind of character Ian Fleming had in mind for his suave secret agent, but his interpretation ushered in the era of the ridiculous gadgets - always just the right ones for the mission at hand, but nevertheless implausible. Previous, and later, Bonds were allowed to rely much more on their wits to overcome the inevitable unforeseen twists and turns - and thus were easier to believe, and easier to become absorbed in as the plot unfolded.One if the very few movies I have found to be utterly unwatchable ...",Kingsman - The Golden Circle
