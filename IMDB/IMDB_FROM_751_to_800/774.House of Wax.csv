0,TheLittleSongbird,Surprisingly this was not that bad,6,10 September 2012,"Considering Paris Hilton was in it I was actually dreading this House of Wax. Some may wonder whether it bears any resemblance to the classic Vincent Price of the same name, other than the name it doesn't at all. I'd rather call it a re-imagining(and an inferior one at that) in alternative to a remake. And actually, despite it not being perfect and also my fears House of Wax was not that bad. It has its flaws, Paris Hilton not helped by her shallow character was awful, a few of the characters are less likable and developed well as others, the screenplay is rather cheesy at times and while Chad Michael Murray is handsome and does appeal to you I am not entirely sure whether he convinced me as the bad boy of the group. However, the rest of the acting is not bad at all, Elisha Cuthbert is actually very good and Brian Van Holt is downright scary as the antagonist. The characters are in a way stereotypical but they are written in a way that makes them generally somewhat likable. House of Wax is not bad to look at either, the camera technique used I am not a fan of but actually it is used effectively and there have been far worse cases of it, but the sets and lighting are wonderfully eerie. The story is on the formulaic side, but not dull or intelligence insulting. Other than Holt, what was impressive about House of Wax was the tense atmosphere, the imaginative and very gory deaths and also the fact that I did find myself amused or frightened throughout. Considering what House of Wax could have been, that is an achievement. All in all, not that bad, not perfect by any stretch but much worse things have happened. 6/10 Bethany Cox",House of Wax
1,Leofwine_draca,Three films in one topped by a fantastic last ten minutes,5,2 August 2016,"HOUSE OF WAX is a serviceable remake of the 1953 Vincent Price classic, which takes a few elements and ideas from the original movie and reinvents them into a modern teen horror. If anything this film is flawed because it tries to do too much. The house of wax is there, but also present are a couple of hillbilly killers seemingly modelled on the anti-social likes of WRONG TURN along with the kind of torturous violence familiar from HOSTEL and others. Really, this is three films in one and each is vying for top place as the movie progresses.Initially I didn't like this film at all. It takes way too long to get started, and half the film is over before anything really happens. The main characters are the usual bunch of obnoxious and/or uninteresting jerks that you can't wait to see get bumped off, and there's way too much lame humour surrounding Paris Hilton. Yes, I said Paris Hilton; apparently this film marks her acting debut. The surprise is that she isn't too bad in the role – at least no worse than the other cast members surrounding her. Of the cast, only Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray stand out – Murray because I thought he was FANTASTIC FOUR actor Chris Evans for a while, and Cuthbert because she's basically modelled on and copying Jessica Biel's character in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake.Eventually the film turns into a typical slasher, with the main characters (teens, twentysomethings, I care not) stalked by a pair of brothers. One's normal if insane, the other's a hulking, long-haired Jason type who wears a wax mask to hide his disfigured face (don't get too excited, the climatic unmasking scene isn't a patch on MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM's that was made seventy years before and still kicks this film's backside without even trying). Some quite extraordinary gruesome deaths unfold, typically involving body parts being lost or removed. Cuthbert is tortured in an obvious nod to HOSTEL and another character is covered in red hot wax. There are beheadings, impalings, stabbings, and a particularly unpleasant demise for Paris Hilton, and the emphasis seems to be firmly on showing as much pain and suffering as possible.The film's climax is something I really did enjoy, thanks to the central conceit that the house of wax itself is made of wax. Therefore we have our protagonists trying to escape from a house literally melting around them while pursued by psychotic killers. It's a quite brilliant ten minutes of film, and a shame that the rest couldn't match this. Most of the blame falls on the novice director who doesn't seem to know what atmosphere is and on the poor editing which the film is full of. Still, for a run-of-the-mill horror it isn't bad and I'd watch that excellent ending again anytime.",House of Wax
2,SnoopyStyle,functional slasher movie,6,12 September 2015,"Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki), her troubled brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her best friend Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton), Paige's boyfriend Blake and Dalton Chapman are on their way to a football game. They take a detour and decide to camp out for the night. A muddy truck interrupts them and Nick throws a bottle that bust one of the headlights. The next day, Wade's fan belt is cut. Carly discovers a pit of dead animals. Wade and Carly catch a ride from the roadkill driver. They find the town of Ambrose virtually deserted. Most of the small town is attending a funeral. Bo (Brian Van Holt) needs to finish the funeral before selling the fan belt. The couple decides to go into the closed House of Wax. Their friends are driving back after getting stuck in traffic.This thing starts pretty slow. It turns into a traditional slasher horror movie. The good news is that Paris Hilton gets killed. The wax figures are good creepy background. Elisha Cuthbert is a good scream queen and there is nothing wrong with a slasher movie where pretty young people get massacred.",House of Wax
3,claudio_carvalho,Worthwhile Teen Horror Movie,7,29 October 2005,"Carly Jones (Elisha Curtberth), her bad boy brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki), and her friends Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) travel to another city to watch an important game. They decide to camp in a field halfway and proceed their journey on the next day. However, the fan belt of Wade's car breaks and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in a close town, where there is a house of wax. When they arrive in the place, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two deranged former Siamese brothers have transformed people in wax statues.I liked this ""House of Wax"", indeed a worthwhile teen horror movie. The story follows the standards of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and other slash movies, and it is well made, has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects and the death scenes are amazing. Even if the movie were not good, watching the sexy and delicious Paris Hilton is worth. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Casa de Cera"" (""The House of Wax"")",House of Wax
4,mark.waltz,Performances of Wax.,1,5 October 2021,"Within nine minutes, I could tell that I really could care less if any of these young characters survived a night of horror at the poorly done House of Wax. They are filled with every single hideous cliche that makes millennial one of the most despised generations ever, with none of the good qualities of that generation given to any of these totally unlikable people. If this is the Hollywood of post 21st Century trying to be thoroughly modern and influence a generation, they are definitely on the wrong page, and this film should be dipped in wax and tossed work and never be found again.For one thing, the film is definitely overly long and it takes forever for anything other than for the discriminating viewer to be anything other than repulsed. Teen films of previous generations were at least campy, and there was nothing remotely comical unintentionally to laugh at. Even at their most idiotic, those teen films at least had a few characters you could root for, no matter how bad the film was. This film tells us young men are stupid and irresponsible and useless and most of the young women are overly serious and humorless and will thus be the ones who get away from the villain and survive. If I was a young 20 something in 2005, I would have been offended by it all and written to the studio to express my feelings.There is definitely a temptation on the DVD to fast forward. The film also concentrates on gore rather than frights, starting with the dead animal graveyard and just getting worse. The actors, if you can barely call them that, led by Paris Hilton, give truly nauseating performances, and there is definitely award worthy elements to worst ensemble. Nobody expected Hilton to be anything more than she is here, but really, there seems no viable reason for this to even been made. It isn't even a remake of the previous versions, so using its name to draw in classic movie buffs is another element that offended me.",House of Wax
5,kosmasp,House of Paris,4,20 August 2013,"This movie became infamous just for the sheer fact, that Paris Hilton was in it. No one seemed to care about it being a remake (well not many people that is). As an update it kinda works if you like your horror movies a certain way. And while you could hate or love the movie because of Paris being in it, that wouldn't be fair to it. She does have two significant scenes in it (one could almost be prove that she doesn't take herself too serious).The effects are good enough and you will get some decent shock moments from the movie. The acting is decent enough for a horror movie, but it is as predictable as it can be. If you don't mind that either, you can have some slasher fun with it",House of Wax
6,jboothmillard,House of Wax,5,19 October 2005,"This is based on the original classic 1950's period horror film starring Vincent Price, it does not stick to the same plot, it's a reimagining of the concept, from director Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan, Unknown). Basically a bunch of teenagers, Carly Jones (The Girl Next Door's Elisha Cuthbert), Nick Jones (A Cinderella Story's Chad Michael Murray), Paige Edwards (twice Razzie winning Paris Hilton), Wade (Friday the 13th's Jared Padalecki), Dalton Chapman (Scary Movie's Jon Abrahams) and Blake (Robert Ri'chard) are heading for a football game, and they decide to camp for the night and travel the next day. The following morning however they find that the car fan belt is damaged and they need a new one, the group notice a stranger, Lester (Damon Herriman), throwing the corpses of animals onto a pile of others, he offers two of them a lift to the near town and its garage. Wade and Carly find the town, Ambrose, is empty, but entering the church they appear to interrupt a funeral, mechanic Bo (Brian Van Holt) comes out and agrees to help them after the funeral, and while waiting the pair wander towards the town's House of Wax, a wax museum empty but unlocked with no significant figures. Of course slowly the six friends realise the true terror in the town of Ambrose, it is a ghost town with all the people being wax figures, i.e. dead people encased in wax like statues, and those who are alive in the town are going to catch them and do the same, or kill them. Wade is incarcerated in wax and part of his face snapped off, Blake gets a knife through the neck, Paige gets a broken pipe punctured through her head, Dalton is beheaded with a pair of shears, and Carly is tied up with super glue squeezed on her lips, but she is rescued, and she and Nick are trying to find a way to stop the violence. They discover that mechanic Bo is a Siamese twin, he was separated from his brother Vincent (also Van Holt), his face born on his back, when they were babies, the last two survivors set fire to the wax museum, the whole building and everything in it being made of wax, and as it melts away in the heat the two killers try to get them, but they are defeated, it is only at the very end after police are in the town and being driven away in an ambulance that a third twin brother is revealed, presumably Lester. Cuthbert and Michael Murray do fine being scared victims, and Van Holt is sinister as both the normal looking killer and his hideous disfigured brother, I had only seen socialite Hilton in bits of The Simple Life before this, obviously she cannot act very well and in my opinion is only famous for those BJ videos and being the heir of the international hotel chain, the gory violence are good enough to enjoy in a darkly humorous way, and it is reasonably thrilling, so it is an alright horror film. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Remake or Sequel. Worth watching!",House of Wax

8,BA_Harrison,House of Wax is a winner!,8,31 March 2006,"A pair of psychotic twins - born conjoined, but separated by their discredited surgeon father - kill anyone who should happen upon their abandoned town, and turn them into wax statues. When six friends on their way to a football game become stranded, they discover the town's awful secret and must escape before they too become exhibits.House of Wax is an entertaining horror romp aimed squarely at a teen audience, and succeeds in being genuinely scary, and even a bit shocking at times. The film is well directed by Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra and features a solid cast who all perform convincingly - red blooded males will enjoy gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert, who, as heroine Carly, goes through hell at the hands of deranged nutter Bo (played brilliantly by Brian Van Holt). For the girls, there is eye-candy in the form of rising stars Jared Padalecki and Chad Michael Murray (who ably plays Carlys brother, Nick). Even Paris Hilton handles her role well (but then she always did seem like a natural in front of the camera!).Gorehounds will delight in the inventive death scenes and the nasty shocks which continue right up until the brilliant fiery finale in the rapidly disintegrating, quite literally named, House of Wax.If a fun-filled, gory chiller is what you're after, pop into The House of Wax - you would be a dummy not too!",House of Wax
9,dbdumonteil,Waxing a movie ...,5,24 October 2006,"The subject is not new,there were lots and lots of movie where people became waxworks in museums .Andre de Toth has an eponymous movie (1952) where the criminal was in love with a waxy Marie Antoinette.Okay the final special effects are quite impressive when the whole house is melting.But the best scenes are the ones where the horror is mastered:in the church,in the house (where there could be someone alive),and in the places where the ""inhabitants "" of the town are gathered.The sequence in the movie theater is rather impressive ,and the use of ""Whatever happened to Baby Jane?"" makes sense ,for the two sisters were monsters too and Davis on the big screen is somewhat waxy .(But make no mistake :Aldrich's film is a true masterpiece,which ""House of wax"" (2005) is not,far from it.) The characters are as uninteresting as any of the ""Friday the Thirteenth"" boy and girl.And the unexpected final twist is here to justify a more than possible ""House of Wax 2"" ...Let it melt away!",House of Wax
10,edwagreen,Scary Wax,2,15 December 2005,"Remember the 3D glasses needed for this picture and others of the early 1950s? The glasses gave me a headache as did the picture.As for being scary, I taught in the New York City school system for 32 years. Believe me, that's a much more scary experience.Vincent Price was his usual diabolical self. Otherwise, this was routine nonsense.1953 was a good year for movies. Why this awful film was made is beyond me.Who cares about a madman running around in a museum to extract revenge for the fire that scarred his face? Didn't we have enough of this nonsense with Claude Rains starring in ""Phantom of the Opera?""Child psychologists must have had a field day with this stinker. They had plenty of business from terrorized children. At age 7, I had nightmares after seeing this flick.",House of Wax
11,BandSAboutMovies,Really fun!,6,1 November 2020,"A remake of the 1953 Vincent Price movie, which is itself a remake of 1933's Mystery of the Wax Museum, this is one of the few slashers this month that has moments that bother me, mainly because of the moment when a character nearly falls into the pit where all the highway's roadkill is stacked up high.It's directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, whose Orphan has equally as upsetting moments. He's also directed Liam Neeson in three movies (Unknown, Non-Stop and The Commuter), as well as the COVID-19 delayed Disney movie Jungle Cruise and the upcoming Black Adam.A group of friends - Carly (Elisha Cuthbert, 24), her brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray, One Tree Hill), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki, Supernatural) and friends Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) - are on their way to a football game when they decide to camp overnight. A truck comes to screw with them and leaves when Nick smashes out one of its lights.The next morning, their truck can't start and they're stuck in the town of Ambrose, which doesn't have much except for Trudy's House of Wax, the home of formerly cojoined twins - and current maniacs - Bo and Vincent Sinclair (Brian Van Holt).If you know the story of, well, any wax museum movie, you know what's coming next. What the film does have that many of those are missing are incredible art direction and a willingness to fill the screen with gore, including impaling Paris Holton directly through the forehead (Becca said that when this happened during a teenage viewing of this in theater, there was a standing ovation). The end, as the entire museum melts*, is astounding.Hilton won that year's Golden Raspberry Award for worst actress, which really just feels like an attack on her for even making this movie. She's not all that bad and really all she has to do is show up and get killed. It is a slasher, after all.***Village Roadshow Studios and Warner Brothers Movie World Australia sued special effects expert David Fletcher and Wax Productions because of a fire on the set during production, which destroyed part of the Gold Coast's Warner Bros. Movie World studios.**That said, it has one of the better soundtracks for a slasher this side of Dream Warriors, if you were into the newer metal of 2005. There's ""Mineva"" by the Deftones, ""Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World"" by Marilyn Manson and, in defiance of my previous statement, ""New Dawn Fades"" by Joy Division and ""Dirt"" by The Stooges.",House of Wax
12,Coventry,House of Wackos!,6,5 June 2005,"Not nearly as astonishing as André de Toth's original starring the almighty Vincent Price, of course, but this loud and well-made remake of ""House of Wax"" does qualify as good and  at times  chilling entertainment. Note that I'm exclusively talking about the second half of the film, as the first half is a little too obviously stuffed with lousy characterizations (the rebel-kid, the bimbo who's probably pregnant....), terrible clichés (detours, rednecks in rusty old pick-up trucks, car trouble in a remote town...) and dead-end scares. Six teenagers plan an extended road trip throughout rural America so usually this means that, one by one, they'll be brutally slaughtered by something or someone! In this case the deranged curators of a seemly abandoned wax museum in the little town of Ambrose. From that point on, ""House of Wax"" turns into an exciting and tense horror flick with great gimmicks and a couple of authentic shock-moments that will unquestionably make you jump in your seat! The plot is incredibly silly and grotesque but that's okay since you can't wait to find out in what repulsive ways the lives of these teenagers will abruptly come to an end. And that's where the makers of this film really put their creativity into! The waxing-process is extremely creepy and the background-story of the museum is cheerfully disturbed! The town's 'secret' is a little exaggerated, but still one of the most ingenious twists in post-millennium horror, for sure. The intense finale  involving ferocious fires and melting statues  excellently makes the connection with the 1953 original and so even my fear of disrespect towards the classics is uncalled for. I can be brief about the acting, though... Elisha Cuthbert is very cute and a popular new icon but I can't really refer to her as a great actress judging by this hysterical role, though. Paris Hilton, however, is outstanding in playing ...Paris Hilton! She's just playing a cinema version of herself here: she gives head, has herself videotaped whilst making out and stumbles around for no other reason than to be part of the group. Luckily for us, her character hasn't got too many lines. Jaume Collet-Serra is one of them boisterous music video directors who promoted himself to horror-director, but I have to admit that he does have some eye for atmospheric camera-work and morbid details! The melting wax statues during the climax are the proof of this...Truly uncanny how the smiles remain on their faces! Recommend in case you're up for some brainless entertainment.",House of Wax
13,michaelRokeefe,The museum of wax is not just for your enjoyment.,4,7 May 2005,"If you don't expect much you'll be satisfied with what little you get. This is a far cry from the beloved original HOUSE of WAX(1953)starring Vincent Price. Similarities all but nil...interesting though. This teen-slasher flick has a group of young people traveling to Baton Rouge to watch a college football championship game. In the middle of the night the group decide to go ""off road"" and rest and get an early start by daybreak. A nasty smell from the woods turns stomachs and builds curiosity. The group comes in contact with a set maniacal murderous brothers taking care of a museum in a small community that is made of wax. The wax figures inside the museum look so life-like for a reason. You guessed it. The movie is a little more than just ho-hum until the finale when the museum catches fire and begins to melt. Heaven forbid a revelation is made that may lead to a repeat. Cast members include: Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Paris Hilton, Brian Van Holt and Jared Padalecki. Cuthbert and Murray are believable and you have to give Hilton some credit for possibly being the reason for some to watch this movie in the first place. She is surprisingly not that bad. The roadkill collector(Damon Herriman)is also a hoot. Jaume Serra directs this sadistic thriller.",House of Wax
14,hitchcockthelegend,The MTV version.,6,6 February 2010,"House of Wax 2005 is a lose adaptation of Charles Belden's story. It stars Elisha Cuthbert, Paris Hilton, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt and is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. The simple plot sees a group of six friends set out to a football game but encounter car trouble out in the sticks. Finding the town of Ambrose it's hoped that their problems can be solved. However this is an odd ghost like town with a huge wax museum seemingly being the only point of worth, and it holds sinister secrets that the friends are going to get wrapped up in; literally.Forget any sort of link to the other adaptations of Belden's story, it is in truth a million miles away from the melodramatic tone of 1933s Mystery of the Wax Museum or the classy horror heart of the Vincent Price starrer House of Wax from 53. This is brought crashing up to date with the slasher audience firmly in the makers sights. The formula is a safe one for the undemanding horror fan, a bunch of pretty teenagers are offed in gruesome and ingenious ways, and the mystery element of potential survivors holds tight enough right to the end. This film does exactly what it promised to do, it's hard to imagine anyone thinking that this version was going to be anything other than a run thru of gory set pieces. The town design is creepy and the titular ""House"" of the title is really rather cool; and fetching with its green and orange make over. The cast aren't asked to do much other than scream, run, fight, scream again and maybe die. So why is the film badly thought of then? I would hazard a guess that it's just a muchness of a muchness in a pretty stagnated sub-genre. Especially during the noughties where remaking horror films of past was the done thing. There's nothing new or fresh here, but neither was that promised by the makers prior to release. Expect your standard teen slasher and this House Of Wax delivers the goods. Anything else will lead to a huge disappointment and have you yearning for that classy Vinnie Price version instead. 6/10",House of Wax
15,Theo Robertson,Oh I've Not Seen This Type Of Plot All Day,4,23 August 2013,"With a title like HOUSE OF WAX one can be forgiven for thinking you're going to be watching a Vincent Price type character adducting young maidens and embalming them with dumb periphery characters pointing and saying "" Oh look at those waxworks . They're so life like . If I didn't know better I'd think that they were real people "" This isn't how things work out and would have perhaps have been preferable to what we have here Effectively this HOUSE OF WAX is yet another long line of horny teenagers in peril which died out sometime in the late 1980s . It's easy to understand why because there's not a lot of mileage to the formula especially to someone who grew up with this type of movie . If there's anything that differentiates it from so many films of this genre it's got some graphic torture porn and is a bit more graphic than the norm but even then that's only damning praise .

16,preppy-3,It could have been worse,7,10 May 2005,"A bunch of 20-somethings are on their way to a concert. They're driving through a forest and decide to stop and camp out for the night. They wake up in the morning to find their car fan belt wrecked. The nearest town is miles away but two of them get a ride by a VERY strange man. They find the town--but it's strangely deserted...and what about that House of Wax building they see? The wax figures in there seem strangely real...There's a lot more to the plot but that's the basic structure. There are a lot of plot holes it you look at this closely. The real plot makes little sense and in the movie the House of Wax is made totally of real wax (that could never happen in real life). Also people keep doing dumb things like wandering into rooms for no good reason (and it just happens to be the room the killer needs them to be in) and going up the stairs when they should be bolting for the door. Still, compared to some recent horror movies, this isn't too bad.For one thing not all the characters are annoying. Even the dreaded ""comic"" relief (played by Jon Abrahams) isn't bad. But he does go around filming everything with a hand-held video camera. Can we PLEASE stop having that in every horror film? It's stupid and has no bearing in the plot at all. And not all the sympathetic characters live--one murder really surprised me. And there is in interracial couple introduced with no fuss. It takes it's time getting to the blood and gore but when it comes it's VERY gruesome and nasty (this is not for the squeamish). The special effects are also excellent if a bit too realistic.As for the acting...it's not totally terrible. Elisha Cuthbert is very good and Brian van Holt is damn scary as the villain. The others actors are OK except for Paris Hilton. She is TERRIBLE!!! Easily one of the worst actors EVER! And Chad Michael Murray shows off his buff upper body--very impressive. It also plays homage to the two originals before it--one character is named Vincent (Vincent Price was in the 1950s ""House of Wax"") and the final showdown is briefly filmed through some Art Deco windows which immediately reminded me of the 1930s ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"". Also there's an impressive ending when the house literally melts! So, an OK pretty gruesome horror film. Just don't examine the plot TOO closely.",House of Wax

18,poolandrews,Really surprised at how much I liked it.,7,20 January 2009,"House of Wax starts as six friends head towards a big football game in Los Angeles, they decide to take the scenic route & camp out for the night.

The center point of Ambrose seems to be the eye-catching House of Wax museum but Wade & Carly are there for a fan belt & not to look at wax exhibits. As day turns to night they realise that Ambrose isn't the quiet sleepy town it first appeared, it hides a dark & shocking secret that Wade & Carly soon discover...This Australian American co-production was the directorial debut of Jaume Collet-Serra & I am proud to admit that I enjoyed House of Wax far, far more than I expected & it's actually become a bit of a favourite of mine now. Produced by Dark Castle Entertainment that was set up by some big Hollywood names & who specialise in audience pleasing better than you would expect horror fare such as House on Haunted Hill (1999), Thir13en Ghosts (2001), Ghost Ship (2002), Gothika (2003) & more recently The Reaping (2007), much like House on Haunted Hill, Thir13en Ghosts & Ghost Ship House of Wax is actually a remake of House of Wax (1953) with Vincent Price (the main bad guy in this remake is named Vincent as a homage) which itself was a remake of Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) so House of Wax is in fact a remake of a remake. Having said that while there are one or two broad similarities between the films this House of Wax is more of a re-imagining than a straight remake & the makers have devised a different central plot, in fact this modern House of Wax probably has more in common with the backwoods brutality flicks like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) rather than a romantic horror since the script has a couple of vicious psycho killers rather than a love struck Vincent Price. I have to say that I am amazed at how much I enjoyed House of Wax, I thought it was a great film that I rate quite highly. There's some wonderful ideas & scenes here, I absolutely love the idea of a literal house of wax in the sense it's made from wax & I thought the fiery climax where it literally melts around the character's & has them treading through oozing hot wax was inspired. I have never seen anything like it before & thought it was a grand concept that worked perfectly within such a visual medium as film & the makers have done the idea proud. There's some really cool gore scenes & while it takes a little while to get going I was never bored by it which is always a good sign. Sure the teen character's are a little clichéd, hollow & their decision making isn't always the best, there really isn't much of an explanation or much in the way of motivation behind the gory goings-on but it's great fun, it works surprisingly well, it's good entertainment that really delivers what it sets out to & is a hugely enjoyable way to pass 100 odd minutes.Besides a really fun story with one or two decent twists House of Wax looks great, the wax museum & the town has a cool 30's art deco styled look & feel about it that I liked, it's a very stylish & good looking film. Vincent's chamber of horrors with pipes, grill flooring & wax drips everywhere has a really nice orange hue to it & it certainly has an ominous feel about it. There's some top gore here as well, from peeled off skin to a huge pit full of dead mutilated roadkill, from gory stabbings to clipped off fingers, from decapitations to the show-stopping scene where someone gets a huge metal pipe stuck through their head & they slide down it! Interestingly Vincent actually films this on a camcorder, maybe the director is saying that we the audience are just as bad as he is since we are also voyeur's for watching & enjoying it. Then again maybe I'm reading too much into it! Director Serra actually manages to generate a fair amount of tension & suspense during the last half of the film culminating in the spectacular & exciting climax. There are many memorable scenes here too beside the gory ones, from the sinister town full of wax statues to Carly having her mouth super-glued shut to Wade having hot wax poured onto him.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this opened to reasonable box-office business & ended up turning a profit I would have thought, although set in the US it was filmed entirely in Australia. The special effects crew actually burnt down an entire sound stage while testing some equipment, apparently a candle caused the fire & the entire studio was destroyed. The acting is alright, the stand out name is 'it' celebrity Paris Hilton who strips to her underwear & gets a great death scene.House of Wax was much, much better than I was expecting & it's actually a bit of a favourite of mine now, I liked it a lot. There are many impressive scenes, some great gore, good production values & stylish sets & even a little suspense as well. Good stuff.",House of Wax
19,Bunuel1976,House Of Wax (2005) **1/2,6,9 March 2006,"As much as I hate remakes, I always try to keep up with any modern horror movie which revisits classic territory. Still, although I knew beforehand that this film wasn't going to be a direct remake of either MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM (1933) or HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and despite the fact that its very title is even more appropriate to its content than it was for the Andre' De Toth/Vincent Price version, I'd still would have preferred that it had been given a different title. But maybe that's too much of a hassle for today's breed of Hollywood screenwriters Anyhow, I'll say outright that this film has no reason to be this enjoyable. Frankly, I was expecting it to be pretty dull and lifeless, a by-the-numbers slasher pic made solely to pick up a few big bucks at the box office. However, it turned out to be a decently made, reasonably interesting and clever addition to the genre. Of course, the worst bits in the movie were the parts dealing exclusively with the teenagers' antics and, in fact, only Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray elicited any sympathy from me while the clichéd characterizations of the black guy and the geek could have been entirely dispensed with. Paris Hilton does nothing here to dispel in any way her image of a fun-loving, dumb blonde bimbo but, at least, she delivered the goods during her gory comeuppance and the chase sequence which preceded it.On the other hand, the best element in the film was the throwback to that 1960's Grand Guignolesque atmosphere prevalent in films like Robert Aldrich's WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? (1962) which, as it happens, is currently being revived theatrically at the local cinema in the Town Of Wax, complete with an opening detailing past events involving skeletons in a famous person's closet which turn out to have a huge bearing on what is happening to the teenagers whose exploits we are currently following. I didn't realize until I saw the final cast roll that Brian Van Holt actually played the role of both Sinclair brothers but he gives a good performance in both cases  menacing and moving as the occasion requires.Of course, a film of this type rises or falls depending on the effectiveness of its scares and gore; I would also add the cleverness with which the villain is exposed: in the case of HOUSE OF WAX, while it's not particularly scary, it is creepy, especially when it is revealed that the whole town is made of wax figures and clever when Elisha Cuthbert realizes that the kindly mechanic could well be the villain of the piece, or the twist ending when we learn that the dim-witted woodsman is another Sinclair sibling. The climactic fight sequence in which the House Of Wax melts away is very effective and exciting. Also, some of the gore  the cutting off of Cuthbert's finger, the peeling away of the face of her boyfriend turned to wax, the geek's decapitation, Paris Hilton's impalement, etc.  is an enthusiastic throwback to the grindhouse quality of 1970s American horror film and 1980s Italian/Spanish genre fare.All in all, quite a surprisingly watchable and pleasant diversion.",House of Wax

The who, how, and why of it aren't really interesting enough to get into here. Like I said, it's all very routine. If you are an avid fan of slasher films then you'll probably like this fine.

22,zardoz-13,"""House of Wax"" Rates An Axe!",1,18 June 2007,"Freshman director Jaume Serra's dreadful remake of the venerable horror classic ""House of Wax"" shows what happens when Hollywood retains only the title and the architecture from the original then artlessly grafts it onto an entirely different movie, here Tobe Hooper's infamous bloodbath ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" The appalling new ""House of Wax"" scarcely resembles either of its historic predecessors: Michael Curtiz's long since forgotten but landmark two-strip Technicolor 1932 versionsupposedly the first contemporary American urban screamerand Andre De Toth's gimmicky 3-D adaptation, with the immortal Vincent Price as the insane predator and Charles Bronson as his sidekick Igor.The first two ""Houses"" dealt with an artistically-inclined sculptor who refuses to accommodate his business partner's wishes that they incinerate their debt-ridden wax museum for the insurance money. They quarrel, a fight breaks out between them, and the partner torches the museum. The greedy partner escapes unscathed, but the conflagration horribly disfigures the sculptor. He emerges with both hands burnt beyond use, his face looking like pizza, and a terrible urge to wreck vengeance on his unscrupulous business partner. At that point, the scar-faced sculptor dons a mask and starts killing people. He covers their corpses in wax to serve as a core for the historic personages in his paraffin museum.Incidentally, Warners Home Video has released both originals on DVD. The 1932 version surpasses the campy 1953 version. Again, all that Serra and veteran TV writers Chad & Carey Hayes preserve of Charles Belden's original screenplay is the title and the setting of the wax museum. Moreover, they have discarded the disfigured sculptor for Siamese twins separated at birth by their wax museum parents. The loony one looks normal while his twin resembles Leatherface from the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Like the 1932 epic, the action in the new ""House of Wax"" takes place in present day America. Scenic Queensland, Australia, stands in for Louisiana as the isolated wilderness setting for this massacre-the-twentysomethings melodrama.An ethically-diverse group of college-aged kids from Gainesville, Florida, embark on a Gulf Coast drive to Louisiana to attend a college football game. Blake (Robert Ric'hard of ""Coach Carter"") and Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton of ""Raising Helen"") tool along in one vehicle, while Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert of ""The Girl Next Door""), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki of the WB-TV's ""Young MacGyver"" pilot episode), her never-do-well brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray of the WB's short-lived ""Lone Ranger"" series), and trash collector Dalton (Jon Abrahams of ""Scary Movie"") ride in Wade's cramped car and bicker. Decked out with a GPS tracking system in his SUV, Blake takes them off the interstate in search of short-cuts but gets them hopelessly lost in the middle of nowhere. Unwisely, they camp out. So sooner have they pitched their tents and popped their brews than a menacing pick-up truck pulls up and blinds them with its high beams. Wade hurls a well-aimed beer bottle and knocks out a headlight. The truck retreats into the night. The next morning Wade discovers that somebody has cut his car's fan-belt. Refusing to abandon his vehicle, Wade sends the others packing off to enjoy the game. Carly sticks by his side. Meanwhile, the others get caught in a traffic jam on the interstate, give up all hope of getting to the game, and return to help Wade and Carly. An unsavory, road-kill collecting redneck gives Wade and Carly a lift to a nearby town. They argue with the redneck, exit his vehicle, and trudge into town. Miraculously, they locate the gas station owner, Bo (Brian Von Holt of ""S.W.A.T.""), at a funeral. Bo promises to fetch them a 15-inch fan-belt after the funeral. Carly and Wade prowl the town. They enter the House of Wax, a museum constructed completely out of paraffin. Predictably, a mad killer embarks on a killing spree. Neither Serra nor the Hayes differentiate the characters of the victims, except Carly's brother whose troubled past with the law enables him to combat the killers with more success than his ill-fated cohorts.The new ""House of Wax"" appeals primarily to thrill-seeking teens and bloodthirsty gorehounds. The teen audience that I sat with cackled with glee at the child abuse scenes in the kitchen at the outset of the movie and snickered at all the clever one-liners. The scene that tickled them the most showed the trampy Paris Hilton character retrieving her lip balm that had fallen into the floorboard between Blake's feet. As the other carload of kids wheels up alongside Blake and Paige, Paige appears to be doing something much more provocative than bobbing for lip balm.Serra and the Hayes twins spend about an hour setting up the atmosphere. A pit of dead deer figures largely during this build-up, so the bodies don't pile up until an hour or so has passed. No insight occurs as to the motives of the killers. The killers themselves lack personality. Consequently, the plot suffers from incoherence, but the filmmakers adhere rigidly enough to the massacre formula that it doesn't take a genius to figure out when the axe will fall. ""House of Wax"" generates few chilling moments, because Serra doesn't know how develop suspense and unleash terror. The gore scenes are what give this movie its one and only star. You'll have a hard time getting the Paris Hilton death scene out of your mind. Gorehounds will applaud it as well as Wade's conversion from live-human to wax figure. The semi-remake of ""House of Wax"" melts down into mediocrity despite some picturesque blood and gore.",House of Wax
23,Boba_Fett1138,"The teenage slasher version of ""House of Wax""",6,27 August 2009,"Hard to say why this movie is being said to be a remake of the 1933 movie ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" and the 1953 one ""House of Wax"". It's only similar in title but its story and characters are all totally different. Seems like a cheap advertising trick, claiming this movie to be a remake of 2 classic fine genre movies. But oh well, having said that ""House of Wax"" isn't a too bad genre movie, even though it also hardly stands out.It's a typical genre movie, that is being a teenage slasher flick, with all of the usual ingredients in it. It doesn't really try to stand out and more remains on the safe side. It's mostly the reason why ""House of Wax"" is being a very average movie to watch.The movie drags on quite long in its first halve, that only seems to be in the movie to fill up its time. There is hardly anything happening in the first halve and it really takes its time to build up things and sets up its characters. It really isn't until the movie its second halve that the movie becomes a true slasher. It however also isn't the best slasher around, since the movie is lacking really in some good main characters. Instead it has far too many characters in it that are all too much alike each other.It's a well made movie though, that is professionally looking and obviously cost a couple of hand full of dollars to make. It has a decent atmosphere, although the movie is being a bit too dark at times.No, don't watch this movie expecting a couple of good and original scares or true great gory moments.

24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Wax on,6,15 June 2008,"I like the original. It's no masterpiece, but Price is cool to watch and the concept was different. I tend to dislike remakes... unless there's an actual need to update, the new director has something to bring to it, or the old film simply was not that good, and an aspect(or more) about it deserves another try, I am of the opinion that they shouldn't really be done. I could write a rant, perhaps even a lengthy one, in a review of one, about such, presumably concluding that sooner or later, this relatively recent fad(lately, it's being done more than can be justified) will have to end, as eventually they'll run out of other people's work to do-over, and creativity will yet again be a prerequisite of every one of the, and not just many(hopefully still most), movie-making processes. But not this one. No, this one is actually fun. Turning the 50's piece into a slasher was by all means an obvious move, but it paid off. There are even homages and references to it. The plot isn't bad, and it develops fine. The acting is reasonable, with Hilton being the definite low-point of the bunch, but is anyone actually surprised by that? The way her character was written was fitting. The script has some nice twists and unexpected events. The music worked well. The cinematography and editing show measures of inspiration, and among the reveals are great ones. The suspense and scariness is pretty solid, most of the way. The story is decent. I would advise against reading too much about this before having seen it, you may accidentally catch spoilers. There is a bit of language, a little sexuality, and a lot of violence, gore and disturbing content. I recommend this to fans of horror, particularly this sub-genre thereof, and those who helped put this flick together. It's certainly sufficiently entertaining and enjoyable for at least one viewing. 6/10",House of Wax

Predicated on the same conceit as the 1950s Vincent Price film of the same name - why go to all the trouble of sculpting wax figures for your museum when you can get a more realistic result by coating actual people in wax, dead or alive, who cares? - it is delivered in up-to-date gore-filled buckets. And the climax is pretty good - the house itself is wax, y'see, and provides a gungey mess for them to gloik about in as they try to escape.One of the survivors has you saying, ""Hooray!"".

Six college kids head for the big football game but pull over for a night of sex and drinking. They are startled by an ominous truck then wake up to tampered vehicles. From there they encounter a town highlighted by a wax museum where its inhabitants look a little too real. Standard plot follows formula until reaching a violent climax. Director Jaume Collet-Serra is aided by great visual images including the massive wax house, but the characters exist to be tortured and murdered for entertainment. Airhead characters played by Chad Michael Murray, Elisha Cuthbert, Jared Padalecki, and Paris Hilton. They run, scream and die horribly and that unfortunately seems to be the point. Hilton seems to be the marketing ticket but that hardly makes up for the fact that she isn't in the entire running time. Technically well made horror mess with a screenplay that should have been burned long before these meat head college brats decided to inhabit it and die.

29,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Pretty decent slasher entry,9,23 June 2016,"Traveling together for a road trip to a football game, a group of friends stumble upon a small, demented town home to maniacal, murderous twins entombing victims in the town's wax museum and must find away to stop them and get away alive.This was a highly enjoyable if only slightly flawed effort. One of the better elements here to this one is the absolutely amazing and breathtaking work done on the set for the titular museum, for there's a lot of time there and it truly lives up to the title with everything made of wax, from the sculptures and figures to the decorations around the rooms and even the building itself which is quite an impressive look throughout here. The eeriness of that look comes from the chilling tactic of encompassing the victim completely in wax which creatures a marvelous look that comes off well here as well as being responsible for several of the film's most eerie and chilling scenes here. The most impressive is the wax-shower contraption which covers the entire body, and a later scene where the stumble upon an encrusted victim and begin peeling it away only to rip chunks of flesh off instead which is insanely chilling. What makes it all the better is the connection to the stalking and slashing here, allowing for the church scene where she first comes across their macabre intentions while hiding from one of the maniacs, a chase amongst the statues at the museum down into the basement and a frantic encounter in the movie theater sitting amongst the rows of statues trying to remain undetected as he stalks them which is a really eerie series of scenes here. The other big slasher scenes here are a lot of fun when it goes into the abandoned factory after the lone girl or the early chases through the town's streets which are quite fun, though really can't compare to the finale in the museum as the fine melting wax provides a fantastic base for the fine brawling and chasing amongst the flaming walls as the chase to get out is a fantastic action scene. Along with the creepy-looking killers and some solid gore, there's enough here to old this off from the few small flaws here. The biggest issue here is the clichéd and uninteresting background for the killers which is just so underwhelming being such a commonly utilized story that it doesn't really impress at all. There's also the lengthy amount of time it takes getting going being stuck with this unlikely group of friends doing nothing of interest for an incredibly long time which does wear thin here.

32,Wuchakk,Engrossing and imaginative modern Mystery/Horror with Elisha Cuthbert,7,11 March 2014,"RELEASED IN 2005 and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, ""House of Wax"" is a horror/slasher about six college students (4 dudes and 2 gals) who drive from Gainesville to Baton Rouge to attend a crucial football game. They end up camping in the woods somewhere off I-10 where some of the party discovers a mysterious town in the sticks that has a curious House of Wax. Horror and death ensue.This is not a remake of the splendid 1953 Vincent Price cult flick of the same name. The only thing these two films have in common is their title, their genre, and the fact that they both involve a wax museum. It's therefore pointless to compare them as they are two totally different stories. Plot-wise, ""House of Wax"" is an obvious mixture of the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and the 1953 film of the same name, along with elements of more modern flicks like ""Wrong Turn"" (2003) and torture porn.Although the first 12 minutes or so are unimpressive with too much annoying shaky cam, the story starts to capture your attention at the camp-out sequence. From there their encounter with a horrible stench, a local hick, and the mystery of the isolated town & wax museum gradually pulls you in. The fairly slow initial 50-minutes are a crucial character-building and mystery-developing foundation to the final horrific hour.The major protagonist of the story is Carly, played by Elisha Cuthbert, who was only 22 during filming and never looked better with her curvy cuteness. The glamorous and infamous Paris Hilton also stars and does a commendable job, but Elisha basically blows her out of the water as far as all-around beauty goes.Speaking of Ms. Hilton, in light of the ads to ""Come see Paris Hilton die,"" it's no secret that her character does indeed buy the farm and, the way it happens, is pretty amusing. The film's worth checking out for this scene alone, especially if you despise her.The picture was shot in Queensland, Australia, of all places, but it works alright as a stand-in for the Deep South, although I don't recall any hills along I-10, as depicted in the background of the town. Speaking of the town, it doesn't look like a Deep South town, but rather a contrived set. Nevertheless, the filmmaking is top-notch in all categories with the rest of the no-name cast doing a fine job. As a matter of fact, the six college kids are all rather likable; even Nick (Chad Michael Murray), Carly's supposedly 'black sheep' twin, once he shows his true colors.""House of Wax"" works fabulously for what it IS, a mystery/slasher flick. The unlikely story is played straight and serious by all involved; there's no silly ""comedic relief"" or camp to be seen. Everyone knows going in that this isn't going to be ""Gandhi."" But if you're in the mood for an entertaining and imaginative mystery/horror picture, look no further. ""House of Wax"" has practically everything you'd want in such a film. Why do I describe it as imaginative? See the conclusion's spectacular melting wax museum and you'll understand; this is F/X at its finest.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 48 minutes.

33,The_Void,It's a remake...and it's GOOD!,7,11 December 2005,"This film is never as great as the Vincent Price version - but it doesn't actually matter, as aside from sharing the same title - the two are hardly the same film. To be honest, I don't know why the makers couldn't just use a different title (something like 'Nightmare in Wax' or 'The House of Melted Candlesticks' wouldn't have been bad) - this would have made sure that the film is instantly going to be taken more seriously than most remakes (as it would, in fact, be an 'original' film) and it would shut people like me who always moan about remakes, up. I see this film more as your classic madman slasher with something of a disturbing twist involving wax. The original film worked more from its creepy elements and the idea of wax figures mimicking people - this film is a heavy rock-laden excuse to pick off a few teens. And to be honest, I liked it a lot. The plot follows a group of (mostly) good looking young people that drive across the country to see 'the game'. While on their way, they make an ill-fated stop in a field, and end up coming across a deserted little town...with a rather strange 'House of Wax'...The gore is surprisingly more brutal than you would expect it to be. Mass releases tend to hold back with the gore - but this one seems happy to go all out for shocks - and scenes that see pipes go through heads, mouths glued together, decapitations and more show this aptly. House of Wax is slow to start, and the bits leading up to the gore are made up of lame 'character building' and various banter...but it's never boring, and once the gore does start - the film really takes off. The best part of the film for me was definitely the ending, however - which is impressive, creepy and very apt all in one! The acting definitely leaves a lot to be desired - but the central characters, played by Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray - are well done. Paris Hilton is responsible for a lot of the flack that the film receives - and for good reason. She may have a lot of money, but she isn't good looking and she certainly can't act. Anyway, Hilton aside - this is really a lot better than you would expect a remake of a classic Vincent Price film to be. As mentioned, it's more of a slasher than anything else; but unlike most films of its ilk, this is actually a good one. Recommended.",House of Wax
34,mm-39,Forgettable,6,17 May 2005,"A forgettable film. Not a bad film, but a forgettable b movie. The second feature at a Driven, heading for the 99 cent bin at a rental store near you. The acting and directing is grade b, but the story and special effects compensate. Pairs Hilton's acting and role is what one lowly expects; Another reality actor trying to better ones self. The story is interesting and keeps the viewer on track after the typically slow start. Has the usual car trouble, help from someone strange, and there is always a town in this style of movie. House of Wax is second feature after one watchs the good movie. Ammityville is the better of the 2 moves this spring. A 5 or 6 out of 10, depending if one is a fan of horror movies. Has a few twists, but nothing special. No surprise the maker did not want this movie to go head to head with Amityville.",House of Wax

36,whpratt1,Excellent House of Wax,6,15 November 2008,"Always enjoyed the films that dealt with the House of Wax and especially the Vincent Price film. However, this film tops all of the films and made a very realistic effect with fantastic graphics and more than you can expect with blood and gore and horrible ways to die. This film starts out with guys and gals deciding to have a great camp out in the woods and wind up with car trouble and a kind local guy leads them to a nice town in order to obtain a fan belt for their car. Chad Michael Murray, (Nick Jones) and Elisha Cuthbert,(Carly Jones) both gave an outstanding performance in this film and Carly Jones showed off a great figure along with Paris Hilton, (Paige Edwards). Paris plays a minor role with just making out with a guy away from everyone and when it comes time to scream, Paige needed help from the extras behind the scenes to scream louder. This is a film you will enjoy viewing and really should be shown on Halloween night. Enjoy",House of Wax
37,siderite,Horribly bad movie,4,10 June 2005,"What is it with Americans and inbred hillbillies? This is another movie that portraits what horrible things can happen to ""adolescent groups"" when going to a ""party"" in ""isolated parts of America"". Some weird guy or guys (sometimes entire insane families) are after them, completely mindful of other people's suffering, wanting to do, well, psycho things.This isn't even a gory movie. 50 minutes in the movie and nobody died, nothing really happened. Then we see ""the old dirty rusty American van"" that flashes the lights on the group, ""the insane family"" that has a passion of waxing people (yeah, that means tying them up and throwing hot wax on them) and a lot of screaming, running around, fighting evil wackos and then screaming again. It really felt like a Scooby Doo movie.Don't watch this movie unless you have a deep love for the American family, the demented one, or you find scary cutting one's finger with a wire cutting tool, or gluing one's lips together with super glue, but binding their hands with sticky tape.

Over all, actually this wasn't too bad. I mean, it seemed like a typical teen slasher film: sex., smart, sexy, shy, big boobed girl., her boyfriend who is afraid of something in the relationship, a stupid slut blonde, the token black guy., the rebel without a cause smart alleck guy/brother., a stoner., violence, swearing, and gore.

However, the plot itself is quite entertaining and story is loaded with some suspense and surprise moments that you didn't see coming. The acting isn't half-bad and is not over-the-top or cheesy. The villain is actually creepy and the horror elements were tastefully done - not overly gory or sadistic.

41,thesar-2,Wax Off,2,24 January 2011,"I admit: I cheated.In my defense, I tried to watch the 2005 remake, House of Wax, 2 times prior to finally getting past the 30 minute mark with use of Rifftrax (MST3k – the update.) Though, it wasn't the funniest Rifftrax track I've heard, it still made this horrible ""Wrong-Turn"" movie bearable.And I don't think it's just my prejudice against Paris Hilton – even with the knowledge of one of the biggest marketing/spoiler in history, so much so they made window advertisements and even tee-shirts that read: ""SEE Paris DIE,"" it was still hard to watch this crap.I was right. It wasn't just Paris buying it – and I'm not talking about publicity. The movie's 113 minutes (too) longprobably 25-30 minutes too long. If you're a Jason Voorhees fan, this is what it resembles: Friday the 13th (the original) didn't (technically) contain Jason, but part II does. House of Wax was those two movies; it makes you wait through one solid movie to finally get to the ""goods.""But, it's not about the horrid pacing, or length, it's just another ""Wrong-Turn"" clone: younglings wander off the beaten path to save time, obviously not lives, to get to ____ (insert party time activity.) In this case, a football game. Well after pissing off the obligatory hillbilly, they rest in the middle of nowhere despite a horrid smell – which was barely explained.Two make it to an eerie small town – is there any other kind in these backwoods movies? – while the rest attempt to make the game. Too bad for them! Traffic is so bad, they decide to put themselves back in the same original locale, or in harm's way.Here's the most unbelievable part (not really): they get picked off one by one by a -gasp- deranged, disfigured and masked killed until the obvious survive. Throw in some boring tension between (hot) Chad Michael Murray's Nick and his captured sister, Carly (24's Elisha Cuthbert), every character urinating roughly every 20 minutes (if you're into that sort of thing, girls peeing or guys pissing together, then this movie's for you!), unnecessary subplot of Paige (Paris – really, did they plan that too (stupid of) a similar name out for her?) being pregnant and brothers who try and appease a dead mother by turning the whole town into waxed still-zombies, and you have the rest of the movie.This movie is so long and contains very few surprises for anyone who's seen any ""Wrong-Turn"" film before, such as: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003, or the original), The Hills Have Eyes (again, remake or original, sequel or not), House of 1000 Corpses, Severance, Psycho, or Wrong Turn (duh.) Actually, there's probably dozens of more examples, but these are the only ones that came to mind.I will say it was effective in two scenes: The finale's (obvious, but still ""fun"") melt down and the ""finger"" incident, which I didn't actually expect. Are those two (15-combined-minute) scenes worth the whole – sometimes, but rarely gory – trip to the wax museum? Nope. Even when you add Paris dying or the mediocre Rifftrax commentary, it's still not worth it. Stick with the better recommended movies of this horror niche genre, mentioned above.",House of Wax
42,Robert_duder,A very captivating series begins right here!!,8,3 September 2005,"House of Wax was a pleasant surprise and I think will be for any lover of horror films, in particular the slasher flicks of yesteryear that really created the genre. ie: Halloween, Stephen King Films, Friday The 13th etc. House of Wax follows the recipe of this films and at the same time sets it's own tone and makes a delicious beginning to what could become a great Franchise of films.My only confusion is the name...I mean Wax definitely plays a huge part in the film but the actual House of Wax could barely be described as a cameo. They spend more time in the deserted town (which in itself is very cool) than they do in the actual House made completely of wax. I am quite surprised by the low rating by critics on here. I expected higher reviews but you really need to be a horror fan because this IS one of the greats in horror films. It even pulls off some campy action which without a great story and some killer death scenes would just be crappy acting.The cast for the most part is sub-standard. Chad Michael Murray as the bad boy?? It doesn't fit him. Fortunately he plays the part by being quiet which helps. During the end of the film when he becomes more of the hero, that fits him better. Elish Cuthbert is a disaster which is too bad because she can act and I have seen her in things where I thought she did well ie: 24, Girl Next Door, but her acting is just awful in House of Wax but fortunately for her she pulls it off as campy. She's not the scream queen material. Annnnd FINALLY ladies and gentlemen...Paris Hilton CAN ACT!! She does pull off the scream queen role perfectly and although her character is no stretch she does a great job. She blows away Cuthbert's performance!! On top of that her death scene is without a doubt (and I have seen A LOT of horror films) the best and most gruesome death scene I have ever seen. I know they pushed that for the film but it is very cool!! Brian Van Holt as the killer(s) also makes for a great bad guy. Vincent as the disturbed separated twin with the face of wax could turn into a great killer right up there with Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees. Newcomer director Jaume Collet-Serra is brilliant in creating the eerie atmosphere and the abandoned town where it all takes place. For the average movie goer you'll probably skewer this film and not enjoy it but for all horror fans out there and I know there is a lot, you will ADORE this film because there has been nothing else even close in a very long time. We can only hope they grab onto this and continue it, there is so much more to do with the series!! Check this one out for an awesome scare fest!! 8.5/10",House of Wax
43,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Wax on, Wax off...",7,21 June 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs In the early 70s, a husband and wife are the parents to two children: one a normal, disciplined child, the other a boisterous one with a hideous facial deformation (who'll grow up to bear a rather startling resemblance to Ozzy Osbourne!!!) The situation drives the mother to the brink of despair, the man to suicide. Some thirty years later, a group of young friends are stranded in a deserted town- with the 'House of Wax' is situated. Only thing is, the wax dolls inside- are real. As they'll soon be finding out...This latest Hollywood remake of a 1953 original (that was no doubt much better!) has a title that suggests a lot of creepy things are gonna happen to the central characters involving 'wax.' Yet not much of the film is about them getting waxed as it is to them just generally being slashed and shot as it would be in your typical teen slasher flick of this ilk (and a lot of it really violent and gory for a film of a 15 certificate nature!) The relevance of the House of Wax to the central story of the two brothers is never really explained anyway and is one of a few other glaring plot-holes through-out.It revs up a bit towards the end and manages to hold your attention till the closing credits without ever really being truly scary in any way or making the big screen debut of famous New York socialite Paris Hilton anymore relevant. ***",House of Wax
44,bowmanblue,A masterpiece of film-making (well... sort of),7,22 May 2014,"Okay, I hate to give away SPOILERS in my reviews, but with the remake of 'House of Wax' it's hard not to. Then again... if you've heard much about the film, you probably know what I'm referring to.For a start, it has Paris Hilton 'acting' in it. That's right... she's 'acting' in a horror movie where young people get brutally murdered in horrific and sadistic ways. That can only lead to one outcome – and it's the one we ALL hope to see! To be fair, Paris Hilton isn't as bad in this (acting-wise) as you may think. I mean... in your average slasher film, we're hardly used to deep and meaningful, three-dimensional characters. They just have to look nice and die when called for. Oddly enough, you could say that Paris has found her niche here (just don't get me started on her other 'acting' exploit 'The Hottie and the Nottie').Anyway, The House of Wax (or 'remake' as I believe it actually is – I haven't seen the first to compare it to) is about a group of unfeasibly attractive teenagers going on a road trip, blah, blah, blah and falling foul of (what Hollywood would have us believe) the average people who live in off-beaten towns anywhere outside the major cities. If you've ever seen a horror/slasher film before then you'll know what to expect.And it's not so bad. In fact, it's an easy watch. The first forty-five minutes are about 'character building' (or as much 'character building' as you can expect in a slasher movie), so no gore there. Then the second half the kills start coming. The gore is nice and the waxworks are nicely creepy. Plus it's a good touch trying to escape from a town made – entirely – from wax.Overall, House of Wax is quite watchable if you're in the mood for some sort of slasher/horror film. Don't let Paris Hilton's addition to the cast list put you off. Don't worry... she gets what's coming to her!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",House of Wax
45,dromasca,a good one in its own genre,7,16 September 2005,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra is at his first film, and he directs with a sure hand a horror movie that is enjoyable, despite playing too much according to the rules of the genre. We have seen tons of stories of teenagers taking the wrong turn and becoming victims of serial killers, from 'Texas Chainsaw...' to 'Blair witches', some worse, some better. The big surprise in this film is that everything seems to have a logic, and even if the quantity of faked blood and horrible deaths is no higher than average, all makes sense. Than, this setting of a faked town, with the house of wax hiding the horrible death of the previous visitors has a certain attraction, and makes well for the pretext of the final scene, where, as expected everything melts down, in a visually good manner. Acting is not that fabulous, Elisha Cuthberg does what we expect from her, while Paris Hilton, well, you do not expect her to act, really! Worth seeing, the fans of the genre will not be disappointed.",House of Wax

Young people doing silly things, a couple of weirdos, some blood, and a big explosion at the end. I thought it was OK for what it was. It held my attention. The House of wax was cool since the entire house was wax.The story has 6 kids who spend the night in the woods. They get a visit from a creepy guy in a truck, but go ahead and go to sleep instead of hauling *ss. Surprise! The next morning, one of their vehicles won't start. So 2 stay behind and hitch a ride while the others are on their way to a game. Traffic causes them to turn around and they are back on their way to pick up their friends. Meanwhile, Carly and Wade are searching the town and discover it's deserted. All the people are wax except the weirdo brothers who want to turn them into wax figures. The movie shows one guy who is still alive being sprayed with hot wax. That had to hurt! Soon it's just Carly and her brother trying to escape the maniacs. Then there is a cool scene at the end where they are escaping the wax house.FYI: Paris Hilton still can't act.FINAL VERDICT: If you like teen horror movies, this is for you.

47,filipemanuelneto,"Much inferior to its older predecessor, but still worthy of being seen and appreciated.",4,23 August 2020,"This film is a remake of a horror film from the Fifties which, despite its age and not being so visually striking, is more interesting from the point of view of the story it tells us. Despite this, this film gives us more or less what it intends to give us and there are a series of moments in which the film, if it is not capable of frightening, at least impresses and makes some pleasant tension.The film begins as an ordinary teen film, with young people traveling to watch a sport match. They camp at night in the middle of a clearing but soon realize that there are people nearby. In the morning, a problem in one of the cars leads the group to ask for help in a nearby village, where a large wax museum visually stands out, totally made of wax, floor to roof, passing through all its interior. From here, we have a slasher film quite similar to so many others, where the characters trying to escape from a murderer who goes on killing them, one after another.One thing that stands out is the number of clichés. Starting with the characters (we have the couple who only think about sex, the good-hearted hooligan, the nice girl who saves the day, the stupid boyfriend thought to be cut to pieces by the villain etc.) to the villains, one of them being a sort of clone from Jason Vorhees. The climax is somewhat predictable, however it makes good use of the fire of the 1950s film.I think the cast did the best they could with the material they received. It is not brilliant and there are no great actors here who can provide us with inspired interpretations. On the contrary, it is a cast of strangers. Even so, I would highlight the good performance of Chad Michael Murray and Elisha Cuthbert, both very convincing and skilled in the task of giving their characters a charisma and sympathy that holds the audience's attention. Paris Hilton, famous for the worst and most uninteresting reasons, appears here as an actress, which she is not and will never be. The proof is this film, where she does nothing but sex, appear half-naked and die. In fact, most of the cast is there to be slaughtered, as usual. Brian Van Holt is the face of evil in this film and was able to truly make chills with his cynical and brutal performance.Technically, it is a regular film, where the sets stands out for its excellent quality, in particular the wax museum, as is evident, but also the church and the villain's house, rich in details. Cinematography is good, but not surprising, and the lighting was very well done and well used to amplify tension and create the necessary suspense environment to make the film work. The deaths are very graphic and this can please fans of the gore. The characterization and make-up, in particular Vincent's, was very well done and is another element taken advantage of in the film of the 1950s. Less noticeable is the soundtrack, quite bland.",House of Wax
48,kapelusznik18,Waxed In,5,17 February 2014,"***SPOILERS*** Not expecting much in the first place the biggest disappointment in ""House of Wax"" was that Paris Hilton playing Paige Edwards had so little screen time in it as well never had a chance to disrobe and was killed off when the film was about half over. But you have to say that Paris had more time in the screen when she was dead, with a wooden stake rammed through her skull, then she was alive! As for the rest of the cast, a bunch of nutty teens, they were about as good as you would have expected in this type of a slasher movieThere's twins Carly & Nick Jones, Elisha Cuhbert & Chad Michael Murray, fighting for their lives against twins Bo & Vincent Sinclair, both played by Brian Van Holt, who are out to not only murder them but turn them into wax figurines for their collection of almost everyone in the town of Ambrose. Nothing like the original ""House of Wax"" but still original in it's own weird way in having an entire town made of wax including the people in it that's been hidden from civilization for some 20 years.That's until a group of teens, going to a Louisiana Stste football game, just happened to drop in looking for directions to get to the game as well as a new fan-belt for their car!Spectacular ending with not only the house of wax but entire town melting like the Witch in the movie ""Wizard of Oz"" with only a very blooded and battered Carly & Nick surviving the carnage. The big surprise in the film is that weirdo rood kill collector, Damon Herriman, popping up at the very end of the movie who's back on his job collecting dead animals as well as human beings giving us in the audience, as well as Nick & Carly, the impression that the best or worst is yet to come in a sequence to the film.

49,TheMovieDiorama,House of Wax melts faster than holding a candle to Paris Hilton's face.,3,19 January 2020,"""Oh look, it's a wax museum!"". Yet another remake of a remake that practically lost its mould as soon as the stupid teenagers opened their mouths. Consuming the mysterious source of 'Mystery of the Wax Museum' and transforming it into a generic slasher that would rather focus on marketing 'The Killers' and 'My Chemical Romance' instead of developing a logical plot with an ounce of intelligence. Or, just maybe, it's a feature length advertisement for Hilton to find her next best friend? De-formed antagonist Vincent would make a worthy candidate, I'm sure. Hilton and her clan of overtly handsome friends travel to Baton Rouge (I think...) for the ""game of the season"". Unfortunately for them, they camp overnight near a semi-abandoned town that hosts a wax museum, unable to start their car again.Madame Tussaud's this is not. A Hilton hotel perhaps? The plot, as outlandishly non-sensical as it was, would've worked if the atrocious screenplay lightened up the tone. Even the slightest of flickers could've elevated the campy fun to be had. Alas, these characters were in the midst of a murderous psychopath who fully equipped his artistic integrity and annihilated these teenagers. Although, wasn't too difficult, let's be honest. The protagonists, who merely emanated the behaviour of socialites, were thicker than a candle made out of earwax. Not a brain cell between them. Never mind the blatant trespassing when entering the closed house of wax or the absence of common sense in any heightened situation. There was one particular moment that shined brightly. The main brother and sister (completely forgot their character names) discover that the remaining townspeople are dead and cocooned in wax. Yet they still thought an elderly woman was residing in a house, pulling the curtain back and forth continuously. Come on!The sheer stupidity that these characters breathed out was simply a means to create exaggerated jump scares and elaborate on the town's sinister heart. They say everything that's on their mind and state every action they are going to perform. Hardly thrilling. Which is a dire shame when considering the surplus amount of gore displayed. Coating these teens in hot wax? Sure. I'm down for that. Snipping fingers and tendons like a blade of grass? Hooray! Javelining a metal pole through Hilton's fake face? Perfect. Damn, she was terrible. Even her stripping sequence was enough to turn heterosexuals into raging gays. ""House of Botox"" would've been more appropriate.The final twenty minutes was an inferno of wax and surprisingly exhumed a thrill or two. But House of Wax smelt more like an infected ear rather than a fragrant Yankee candle. And that pointless attempt for a sequel was laughable!",House of Wax
50,Tweetienator,Creativity Gone Wrong,6,9 March 2019,"House of Wax (2005) has only little resemblances (the murder and the wax figures obviously) with the movie of the same title featuring the great and almighty Vincent Price (1953). Whereas the old movie tastes like a good old wine, the new one is more like a candy bar.House of Wax 2005 goes the same road like all those uncountable teenie-slashers and it deserves imo a higher rating, anyway, so if you like movies like Scream, Halloween, Friday the 13th and the like, House of Wax with Paris Hilton will be an entertaining one too for you.And last but not least, if you got the spare time don't forget to watch that fine nostalgic piece with the great maestro Mr. Price too.",House of Wax
51,BaronBl00d,Wax - Melts in Your Hands AND in Your Mouth,5,30 October 2005,"Oddly refreshing tale about a ghost town off the beaten track that has some strange inhabitants and a genuine wax museum. I say genuine because it is a House of Wax in name and building material. The entire house is made of wax. Now, it is here that one must abandon any obvious questions about what a hot day would do to the wax, etc... Once you suspend disbelief, this film becomes something better than you might have expected. I was definitely surprised, especially after the first ten minutes or so when I said out loud to myself that this movie sucks. The first ten minutes have a couple car loads of drinking, nubile teens on their way to a sporting event but needing to camp not far from this town and museum which seems to have evaded the authorities for ten years...anyway, again back to suspending disbelief. But once the action gets started, the suspense compensates for much of the inexperience in the acting and the holes in the script. Credit must go first to director Jaume Collet-Serra for his vision of what this town would look like and what this museum and its inhabitants would be like. The other credit has to go the special effects guys for making this vision work most of the time. CGI effects were used only when needed, and the real effects add immeasurably to the believability of the action. The acting seems to get better too as the core of teens is dwindled down to the couple that CAN act, as can the fellow(s) playing the killers. There are some wonderfully creepy scenes - my favorites NOT involving the excessive gore that does resonate throughout. The movie theater sequence had an almost magical air to it as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? played in the background. The sequences involving the church worked well too. Much of the film reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre with its gritty filming style, but this film has tons of gore and some special effects that do go overboard at the end. Chad Michael Murray and sexy Elisha Cuthbert play the two siblings that go through a marathon of hell at the expense of Vincent(an obvious homage to Vincent Price in the original House of Wax). Other than the title and a museum populated with bodies dipped in wax - there is NO connection with this film and the original House of Wax. Before you get the impression that I loved the film, there are some incredibly big problems with plot continuity. You are expected to disbelieve way too much. The acting outside of the three main leads is weak, though virtually everyone shows promise except for Paris Hilton. She is a bad actress. Let's face it, if she wasn't beautiful and famous she wouldn't be in this or any other film. She does jiggle well in a sexy red lingerie ensemble, however. The film was made by the Dark Castle Films. They also made the remakes of House on Haunted Hill and 13 Ghosts. This film isn't nearly as good as the former but much better than the latter.",House of Wax
52,insomniac_rod,Does not even tries to be good. Simply mediocre.,1,20 August 2006,"I will be objective and I know that it was my decision to watch this movie, nobody forced me to watch it. So I repeat, I will be as objective as I can.This is by far the worst main stream Slasher flick produced in the 2000's. The acting and situations are absurdly over the top. There ain't no room for credibility or logic. The movie just happens without coherency and it goes directly to the point in the most absurd manner. Take as an example the death scenes. Yes, some gore and some ""creative"" camera angles but those scenes just happen in the middle of nowhere. There isn't an atmosphere that justifies them. The false scares are also a mediocre manner of getting attention.The acting couldn't be more atrocious. But what can you expect from Elisha Cuthbert and Paris Hilton? The direction is just regular. At some points, the movie looks like a direct to video Slasher but it's saved by decent cinematography. The f/x are not that bad but it's not a good aspect about the movie because with such a high budget, it's the least the producers could do.Please, please, avoid this one. The movie is boring, non sense and very cheesy even for die hard fans of Slasher flicks like me. Instead of watching ""House Of Wax"" rent any Slasher flick from the 80's.

I'm not sure why so much effort was put into making them all into such distasteful characters, but my current theory is that it is simply a misguided attempt to keep some element of mystery in the movie, since you already know they'll be killed off one by one. In the movie's defense, a good story involves good character change, and it cannot be denied that there is plenty of that here, it's just too bad that's not all there is.I'm reminded of the ridiculous horror film Wrong Turn, which featured an equally meaningless group of college-age kids getting lost in the woods and being confronted by some clownishly made-up in-bred rednecks who gleefully off all of the unfortunate kids stuck in the big bad woods. That and Texas Chainsaw III, but I digress. As I am led to believe was also the case, to a certain extent, at least, in the original film, the remake concerns a deserted town in which there can be found a wax museum whose feature displays are so realistic because there are real people beneath the wax coating, presumably embalmed in the wax yet slowly rotting away. The biggest advance that this film makes is in some truly revolting scenes, such as a scene where one of the kids is made into a wax sculpture and his friend tries to free him, only peeling the skin off his face as he tries to get the wax off of him. On the other hand, there are also some thoroughly botched scenes, like the one where a girl gets the tip of her finger cut off and it bubbles over with blood like a fountain. Tom Savini, who was doing better gore effects than this two and a half decades ago, would be appalled.Remember in House of the Dead when those kids went to that island for the rave of the century, found it completely deserted, and didn't really seem to be bothered? It's kind of the same here, they take a detour on their way to a big football game get lost on a detour and decide to camp in the scary, smelly, creepy woods. They smell the smell of decaying flesh, and a pickup truck pulls up and shines its brights at them, no one getting out or responding when they call to them. Nick, the biggest jerk of the lot already, hauls off and throws a bottle at the truck, smashing one of the headlights. Let me tell you something, you do not get away with that in the country. The driver doesn't even have to be a crazed killer to jump out and knock your block off. Instead, the truck ominously drives away, leaving the kids convinced that the situation is under control, so they settle down for the night. After later running into the guy in the pickup truck as he dumps dead animals onto a massive pile of rotting dead animals (hence the smell of the woods), they smartly decide to hitch a ride with him to town to buy a fanbelt to replace the one that snapped in their truck while it was parked the night before. The town they get a ride to turns out to be a forgotten relic of the 1960s, which ""doesn't even show up on the GPS but is remarkably maintained. No one's walking around the town but there are plenty of people at the funeral home, including one man, incredulous that they would interrupt his grandmother's funeral but who soon recovers and agrees to offer them what turns out to be a lot of waxy help.After this point, the movie runs parallel to countless other movies college kids get lost in the woods, one gets kidnapped, and the rest get killed one by one. At the moment I'm thinking of Texas Chainsaw 4, by far the worst of them all, including the ludicrous 2003 remake. You'll yawn through the rest of the film, if you haven't yawned through it so far, although there are some impressive special effects with the wax, some I've mentioned already, including an obviously CG but still interesting climax, which describes the fate of the House of Wax. Essentially, it's just another bad slasher movie from the 1980s, but with Paris Hilton and, the one thing that has caused horror films to lose their souls, computer generated special effects. This is certainly not the worst modern horror movie you could watch, I'm mentioned in this review some that are at least as bad and some far worse (like House of the Dead), it's just so tiring to see yet another one come out with so little thought or effort put into it.",House of Wax
54,videorama-759-859391,Film needs a good waxing,4,2 May 2014,"I don't know if it was just me, or did this film run intentionally longer than it should of (sarcastic note). Watch this movie and see if you'll agree. There's a lot of getting to know you characters at the start, where we also see Paris doing something she's good at, and it's not acting. Why this doesn't work, is because we don't really care about any of the characters, except for the troubled crim brother (Chad Michael Murray, in a quite good performance). We follow these good looking teens (more the norm these days, as we've passed through the millennium) on the road to terror. It appears someone's stalking them. Cut further ahead, the films saving grace and the best performance, that of a creepy trucker (Adelaide's Damon Herriman) who we know has something to do with the terror and carnage that awaits (you'll love how Paris gets it), and the whole museum at the end, all melting was a beautiful sight, only the movie isn't. There are many stalled and, if I can use the word, un terrifying moments, a few dead stop ones too. The film takes too long to where it's going. God forbid they make a sequel. Here's one horror that very much disappointed me, and rarely does that happen.",House of Wax

""House of Wax"" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. This version really puts the Vincent Price version of the movie to shame. I only know a few of the young cast in the movie. The ever troublesome Paris Hilton; the pain in the you know what seems to be more seductive than ever. At least, she didn't try to copy her infamy. Well if she likes to do horror, she's better than ""Wheel of Fortune's"" Vanna White. She beats Vanna HANDS DOWN! And the scene of where ""House of Wax"" was made was no joke. The house was made of wax, and the victims were able to get out of there before the get waxed like their friends. Those two twins Bo and Vincent(the deformed twins) were maniacs from the get-go. The parents raised them well, except for Vincent. And I think they became equally warped. How come the the one in the other pick-up happen to be creepy, but not as bad as the other two. That's another story in the book. I guess he had to follow his heart, and not the other twins who turned Ambrose into a tourist ""trap"" for unsuspecting victims. This movie is like ""The Phantom of the Opera"" meets ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". And this movie is one of the scariest one in 2005! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",House of Wax
56,jtindahouse,Come for Paris Hilton - stay for the surprisingly good movie!!!,9,18 December 2005,"I'll admit I rented House of Wax mainly to have a good look at Paris Hilton because I figured I was in for just another clichéd horror film. I was wrong. It starts of sort of making to guess who the bad guys are, who the good guys are, what the bad guys are up to, how the good guys are going to start being killed etc. This is good as keeps you interested and concentrating on the movie (you'd be surprised how many horror films leave out this element). Then you get in the more classic horror scenarios, first person dies without the others knowing so they have to stay because they can't leave their friend. This part of the movie is done well because originality is used in very unique ways as you'll find out towards the end.During the movie I was constantly comparing it to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because they are very similar. The only thing I could find that the Chainsaw Massacre had in its favor was that it claimed to be based on a true story. Think about what you're opinion of House Of Wax would be if it claimed to be true story when you are watching.But whatever you do, don't miss out on House of Wax because you think you're just in for another modern day horror film - you're not.",House of Wax
57,thinker1691,Twins of Wax,6,28 April 2006,"The original House of Wax, staring the late great Vincent price, which terrorizes audiences in the 1950's was remade in 2005. However, this was in name only. The new version has rising star Nick Jones (Chad Murray) as the rebellious leader of a group of teenagers (Jared Padalecki and Paris Hilton) who are on a road trip to a season final football game. Along the way, the group encounters a strange and twisted pair of brothers who are decidedly bent on adding the unsuspecting group to their wax collection, scattered throughout the town. Unlike the original which had a small museum size collection of historically popular wax figures, the psychotic twins have encased their whole home town in wax. Horribly disfigured at birth, one twin and his deranged brother are murderously intent on offing the wayward teens and adding them to their bizarre collection. The original and certainly classic movie was encapsulated in drama and creeping terror. The new version offers sex, Gothic death scenes and a heart pounding visual climax. Along the way, the ingredients of sex and torture become paramount. What the second version lacks in artistic theater, it makes up in visual excitement. ***",House of Wax

59,dfranzen70,"Lifeless, illogical, but Elisha Cuthbert",3,6 January 2006,"House of Wax, a very loose remake of the 1953 original, is so stridently campy, replete with bad jokes and countless clichés, that it practically dissolves into vapors before your very eyes.A group of college-age kids (or maybe they're out of college; either way, they act like high schoolers), on its way to a Big Football Game, takes a shortcut ... to DOOM! Of course, it's ironic that they take a shortcut, since cutting is indeed involved. They spend the night camped in the woods and are interrupted by a strange pickup truck whose lights shine directly on them. Muahahaha. The next morning, the fan belt to one of their cars is broken, and they find a dumping ground of dead critters, and...Oh, let's face it. You're never gonna watch this for the horror, are you? Maybe you'll root for Paris Hilton to die or you'll watch it for Elisha Cuthbert, who's pretty good. If these are your noble goals, you probably won't be disappointed. The rest of the cast is completely forgettable; in fact, aside from Hilton, you don't openly wish any of them would die, as you might in better horror films.Only some of the action takes place in the actual House of Wax; the rest is in the other buildings of an apparent ghost town - made of WAX! Dun dun dun! Which means ample opportunities for our screwy gang to get eviscerated and flayed and such. Much fun. There's a movie theater and a gas station and houses, all filled with implements of destruction.Hilton is believably vapid and lifeless as, in an example of brave casting, The Blonde Slut. Since she spends much of her screen time smooching with her boyfriend, there aren't many chances for her to show off her rapier wit and keen intellect. Cuthbert is a fine heroine, and she shows just enough skin to make the movie slightly interesting. At least you don't root for her to die, always a plus for your protagonist.There aren't too many genuine scares, but there are just enough to bring this above a true BOMB rating. Still, not enough to make you, I don't know, scared. Or something.",House of Wax

62,Chris_Docker,Familiar slasher pulp with some debatable redeeming features,6,29 May 2005,"(NB No spoilers till the second half of these comments  further warning given so you can avoid them and still read the first half if you want)House of Wax is a formulaic Hollywood-style horror film but should not necessarily be dismissed on that account. This style of movie might be compared to the elaborate rides at modern fairgrounds that whiz you in the air with enough G-force to elicit an elongated ""Eeeeeeeeeaaargh"" but with all the built in safety features so you know it won't be really scary like say, mountaineering or pot-holing. Like the fairground rides, they also tend to come decorated with nubile young women and a heavy rock soundtrack and a kind of 'dare' factor. They are also heavily tailored to market- values (and prejudices).House of Wax is not a re-make (although it has some loving references to the 1953 picture of the same name)  rather it is a wholehearted appropriation of the original idea that contains genuinely scary moments and, if that's your cup of tea, a reasonable Saturday night entertainment at the local multiplex.A group of six young friends make a road trip to see a major football game but get waylaid near a small, forgotten town that has some dark secrets. They have to battle it out against the creepy locals to avoid being turned into wax effigies.The strength of the film is that its reach doesn't exceed its grasp, and the attention to particular detail perhaps makes it stand out slightly above the average slasher movie. If we dismissed the populist and commonplace as low-brow, would we have kept Andy Warhol or Art Deco? This type of no-brainer film is an art in itself and, in this instance, though far short of a masterpiece, delivers the goods. In a self-reflective way, the actual 'House' itself even has an external deco appearance, reminding us that trash can still be art. Some of the clips (clawing through a wall of soft wax - or the ingenious 'waxing' machine that is not unlike a carwash in its ghoulish, slightly comedic sort of way) are sufficiently well shot to be dug up in fifty years time and treasured the way the (much lower budget) Hammer Horror films of old are treasured by their fans today.(Spoilers follow) The downside of the movie, even accepted within such narrow, limited ambitions, is that its pandering to what people want is heavily skewed by American 'morality': gratuitous gore and sex, for instance, are generally part and parcel of the horror-flick, but even compared to many old black and white films it is tamed down  tantalising flesh, but no naked bosoms; ingenious violence but no lingering on details. It reminds us that America (i.e. the U.S.A.) is both obsessed with sex and terrified of it, wants to have it and forbid it at the same time, and for mainstream acceptability these types of 'values' have to take precedence over artistic considerations. Sex and nudity in the U.S. is likely to provoke intense discussion over whether it should be allowed or not on religious grounds  whereas in Europe, more people are likely to be excited over whether it had a justifiable artistic context. Similarly with prejudices  there is a token black man nice guy, but it is OK to poke fun at 'rednecks' quite relentlessly  this type of social hypocrisy speaks volumes about America's failure to understand basic principles while at the same time paying token respect to them. Not all of the characters are dead at the end. Of the two women, guess which one gets her come-uppance  the brunette that screams hysterically but probably doesn't have sex, or the large-breasted blonde who has maybe got herself pregnant? Add considerations such as the wax-man when he finally cometh looks a bit like Michael Jackson on a bad day, and the clips from Whatever Happened to Baby Jane appear not just as clever puns but as appeals to lynch-mob mentality. Even the hero of the piece is a criminal (a familiar enough modern plot device, though an increasingly worrying one when we ask why the public fascination for an 'hombre' or 'a bit of a dark horse' has developed into glorifying an offender without any subtle psychological overtones). Even just before he is revealed as a possible relative of the psycho-killer, we are persuaded to find his theft of police evidence (a video camera) quite charming and understandable.House of Wax does not deliver the sadistic terror of horror films such as Audition, or the incipient threat of, say, Silence of the Lambs  it delivers a few shocks, but the most insidious one is perhaps the kowtowing of American film-making to popular mentality. The lowest common denominator of entertainment sometimes says more about a nation's true nature than all the pretensions of high art.",House of Wax

Naturally there is a maniac on the loose, or two in this case, and guess who they are intent on killing?There is really not a lot more to this film, which might be called a slasher flick as well as a ""melt flick"". The only question is how many if any of our heroes will survive?

64,drownnnsoda,"Routine, But Surprisingly Well Done.",7,6 July 2006,"""House of Wax"" is a very formulaic horror movie, it follows all of the formulas that are used in modern slashers, but it still manages to keep itself entertaining and enjoyable enough for any horror fan to enjoy it. The film is about a group of teenagers are on their way to a college football game. They stop in the woods and set up a camp and party all night, hoping to leave early the next morning. A strange person in a truck arrives during their partying, and one of the kids throws a beer bottle, smashing out a headlight. The next day, they find that one of their cars is broken, so the group splits up, most of them leaving for the game, and the rest stay behind to head to an old abandoned town, where there is a magnificent wax museum and all kinds of odd things. But little do they know, the entire town is one giant wax museum - each wax sculpture an actual corpse, coated with a thick layer of wax...This movie was really clichéd in some instances, but it was still entertaining on many levels. The cast was good, and surprisingly, Paris Hilton can actually act - she's not amazing but she pulled it off better than I expected. Elisha Cuthbert is actually a pretty good actress too, and I was rooting for her throughout the whole movie. The chemistry between her character and her twin brother, Nick, was kind of awkward though. They seemed more like ex-boyfriend/girlfriend, but that's a minor problem really. Chad Michael Murry is Cuthbert's opposite twin brother, and Jared Padalecki plays Carly's polite boyfriend.Really, the most remarkable thing that I picked out of this film was the wax town, Ambrose. It was a really atmospheric and spooky location, and the wax figures were interesting too. The finale in the melting wax museum had some great visuals, probably my favorite scene from the whole movie. There's some decent (and realistic) gore in the film as well, but it doesn't go too far overboard and has it's limits. This film obviously ripped off the 1979 cult-horror film ""Tourist Trap"", go back and watch that and you will notice the many similarities between the two. According to IMDb though, this film is a semi-remake of that film, no surprise there.Bottom line - ""House of Wax"" is a pretty formulaic slasher movie, but it does what it's supposed to do, and it manages to be a pretty entertaining movie nonetheless. Expect a routine slasher movie that is slightly better than most (and don't forget to look out for the nicely done ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?"" theater scene). I enjoyed it for it's creativeness and the nicely told story - most horror fans won't be disappointed with it. 7/10.",House of Wax

The actors were well casted, and I enjoyed all the characters and the actors playing them did a good job, yes, even Paris Hilton did a pretty good job. The movie was never boring, it always kept you interested and on the edge of your seat. The violence was a bit too graphic at times, but overall it wasn't that bad, other horrors have been far worse when it comes to carnage. Now it's not like the movie was flawless, it did have some flaws. The acting in a few scenes was kinda lackluster, could have been better if they would've just tried again I'm sure. I know a lot of people thought Paris Hilton was going to just be terrible in this movie, in my own personal opinion, I actually thought she did pretty good In her own respective role. She did get to dance around in her lingerie in 1 scene, so you straight guys out there, there you go. For the ladies and gay guys, do not despair, there is definite eye candy for you as well. Chad Michael Murray is one of the main stars here, who actually acts well and looks hot in his role at the same time, hard to find in a horror movie! So does Jared Padalecki, he does well in his role, and looks good doing it. This movie is just a good time for horror movie fans.

The cast do a good job with their characters as well. The best part of the picture is the third act that makes it's worth seeing. The characters in the film are fleshed out enough, you also get to know them well enough before they meet their horrible death. When Paris Hilton is around, you are hoping her death scene is the one of the best parts in the picture. But it's not and i wish, she died a little better than that. The movie rather has a slow build-up at first but its improves once you get into the town of Ambrose. There's some genuine good moments here and this should keep horror fans happy. Joel Silver (The Matrix Trilogy, 48 Hrs, Road House) and Oscar-Winner:Robert Zemeckis (Beowulf, Contact, Forrest Gump) are the producers of this slightly better than expected effort. Worth a look.

67,EVOL666,Relatively Amusing Teenie-Horror Remake,7,8 March 2006,"I typically prefer more ""underground"" horror films to the recent run of theatrical teenie-theater trash and remakes that have bombarded the cinemas recently...but honestly, even with all it's faults and annoyances - the HOUSE OF WAX remake wasn't too bad. I did hate the cast, made up of your typical pretty and popular Hollywood post-teens in typical and un-unique stereotypical roles (the tough-guy loner ""rebel"", the goofy but semi-hip dork thrown in for comic relief, the slut, the tough but innocent female lead, the nosy boyfriend, and of course the token black guy...). But of course, these films aren't typically praised for their performances or originality - so I won't bitch too much. Also, it's been far too long since I've watched the original HOUSE OF WAX for me to compare the two - so I'll rate this one strictly on its own ""merits"" (or lack thereof...).Six kids in two cars are on their way to an out-of-town football game. They camp for the night and have a brief run-in with a weirdo in a pickup truck. When they wake up one of the cars has a busted belt. 4 of the six continue on to the game, the other two decide to head to a small nearby town instead to get the part they need. Of course, the town isn't what it seems - and when the two discover a strange wax museum, things start to go nuts as the towns secrets are revealed...HOUSE OF WAX drags on for the first fifty minutes or so, but not so badly that it'll put you to sleep - especially if you sit around with a few friends and make fun of Paris Hilton and the ""tough-guy"" and the other dildo's on display here. But once things get moving the film stays pretty fast-paced for the rest of the run time. There are actually some very decent kill and gore scenes - much stronger than I would have expected for such a film (Paris Hilton's demise and the baseball-bat face-smash being particularly notable...) and are most of the reason this film gets an OK rating from me. No actual tits or ass, so sleaze fans will be disappointed. A good bit of typical horror cliché ""jumps"" and ""twists"" which I find annoying but are nothing out of the ordinary for this type of production. An OK way to blow a couple of hours - ""theatrical"" and younger horror fans will probably dig it a lot and may appeal to more ""hardcore"" horror fans due to a few relatively gruesome moments. 7/10",House of Wax

69,JoeKarlosi,House of Wax (2005) ***,7,15 May 2005,"(possible spoilers)I can't believe I'm writing these words, but this was a very pleasant surprise and actually a good horror movie - or more specifically, a thoroughly enjoyable ""maniacal killer"" film - and it's a worthy heir to the throne of the best of the 1980's Slasher Pics. What HOUSE OF WAX turns out to be is not so much a Lionel Atwill or Vincent Price clone, but rather a dash of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, a teaspoon of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, and a heaping cup of Friday THE 13TH all rolled into one suspenseful, scary, and - most surprisingly of all - 'gory' package (when did the MPAA get so generous again with what we're allowed to see)? If you are capable of having a good time with at least some of those 1980's slaughterfests, this should deliver the goods for you - and even if you aren't, there are also elements of mystery and creepy otherworldliness to make you uneasy along the way.The film's protagonists are two twins who were conjoined at birth, later separated, and have now made the transformation into full-grown nut jobs. Living in a forgotten little ghost town in the middle of nowhere, they're trying to re-populate the village by capturing people and turning them into wax figures to honor their deceased mom (she was a wax sculptress herself and gained notoriety for fashioning her own House of Wax). And true to slasher form, a group of adventure-seeking twenty-something's wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time.Now we come to Paris Hilton. In fairness to her, most fans and critics had their minds already made up that her acting debut would be horrid before the first frame of film was even shot. As for me, I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt before passing judgment. Yes, I doubted she could be very good, but what I found was that Ms. Hilton is as good as any other blonde bimbo from most exploitive stalker-on-the-prowl flicks during the past 25 years. She was perfectly fine for this type of film, and if we'd never heard of her before now we wouldn't even bat an eye at her (except when relishing her striptease scene, which doesn't go far enough for my money).I've gone on record numerous times in saying how fed up I am with modernized ""remakes"" of older movies from any genre. But when I discovered that HOUSE OF WAX was really not a 'remake' (except in name only; and Hollywood should really work on calling these re-hashes something different to at least make them easier to identify from their predecessors), I decided to give it a whirl.

While the title blatantly aligns itself with the Vincent Price film of the same name, Juame Serra's retooling heads in a direction that brings to mind one of the most unsung horror films of the 1970s: David Schmoeller's ""Tourist Trap,"" the tale of a roadside-attraction owner whose deranged brother transforms stranded teens into lifelike mannequins. Here, a half-dozen college kids heading to a football game camp out after taking the requisite shortcut that leads into a literal Nowhere; they are menaced by an anonymous truck-driver, and awaken to one car with a broken fan belt. When young couple Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and Wade (Jared Padalecki) hitch a ride to the nearest town (driven by the requisite creepy redneck roadkill-scraper), they discover the titular establishment, and meet Bo (Brian Van Holt), one half of a homicidal brotherly duo preying on unsuspecting passers-by. While a big (or at least bigger) budget movie like this is almost required to sacrifice suspense and atmosphere in the name of overblown action (this is a Joel Silver production, after all), ""House of Wax"" builds a bit of tension along the way, and uses unconventional plotting to subvert expectations (at least somewhat) for the inevitable body countheck, we even get a little character shading beyond the usual two-dimensional exposition. The set design possesses an appropriate artificiality that only seems to have one foot in reality, and Serra transforms the small town into a sinister fright-house where few areas go unexplored (there is a great scene in a vintage '50s movie theater, set against the image of a haggard Bette Davis singing a show-tune in ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?""); and the climax manages to be a stunning spectacle without being over-the-top. While it shatters no barriers of originality, ""House of Wax"" is a welcome respite from America's current fascination with torture porn.",House of Wax
71,truemythmedia,More Fun Than it Has Any Right to Be,5,30 October 2019,"House of Wax is a solid horrorfest of a film, not at all the best I've seen, but it works in terms of its creative, violent deaths which make it stand out from its dull characters and weak writing, after the sluggish first half is when the horror begins and doesn't let up, if blood and abhorrent violence is your type of horror then House of Wax is a safe bet. If you're more into smart horror with clever twists and anticipation, skip this one as it is not a smart man's horror film, it's filled with inconsistencies and stupid conviences, but if you're willing to look past those and just enjoy the violence, you'll have a good time.",House of Wax
72,Samiam3,"A little above mediocre, but pretty waxy and cheesy",6,26 April 2010,"Remake or not, you have to admit House of Wax is artistically creative, but its not until the climax where this kind of quality contributes to the entertainment value of the story. So what the IS the story, it's truly nothing important, a bunch of kids driving across state to go to a major football game. They discover a tow made entirely of wax, and a few deadly secrets lurking inside, ready to pick them off one by one. I guess the worst thing about house of Wax is that is not scary. It's a good example of the incorrect way to spook your audience. The film relies on lots of superficial shocks, the kinds that have been done millions of time before, so much so that you can easily see them coming (hinted by little things like camera work, and duration of pauses, misplaced sound cues)House of Wax starts off okay but the middle section is kind of boring, (the only good part being what happens to Paris Hilton). The film is best in its final twenty minutes, where the big fight is staged in a wax mansion rapidly melting from an ever growing fire. So I think it's fair to say that House of Wax is not terrible. I've seen far worse, but to be honest my taste in these movie is in the minority. Frankly there are a number of other films that I'd recommend before this one, but of course the descion is up to you.",House of Wax
73,aimless-46,Played for Laughs,4,15 May 2005,"Ignore the extreme votes about ""House of Wax"", in no way is it either a ""1"" or a ""10"". I will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing ""House of Wax"" or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie look very promising, which is what trailers are supposed to do. There is only one thing for sure with trailers, if the producers can't cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck-fest. But a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it does not give you much idea about the total package. Here a little research can be valuable. ""House of Wax"" stars Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than to either her fellow Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen), and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume, in his feature debut. These are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of Production Designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the look of ""Ghost Ship"". Once again Walken's work is worth seeing, so much so that it looks like 90% of the movie's $30 million budget went to production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film (finger cut off, lips glued shut, tied up, and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff). By-the-bye, Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in ""The Girl Next Door"", about one big pig-out away from having a major weight problem.Which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging from the what was on the screen, this might actually be true. It looks like everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Unfortunately, whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay disparity, the contributions of all these inexperienced/incompetent volunteers amount to less than zero.Inexperienced Steven Window's DP work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert ""Pearl Harbor"" here) they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group. Rather than linger over and showcase the sets, Window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work. Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera, and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the movie's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets.Chan Hayes did the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity. One saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (insert ""Van Helsing"" here). The murders are played for laughs, too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six. The audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar, although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy.The good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, conjoined twins, and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets to bathe in). All this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida although from the many hills it sure looks like Paul Hogan's country (attention location scouts-the gulf coast is not noted for it's rolling terrain). The screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed. Since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere, you wonder why it wasn't also cut to reduce the boredom factor.What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic-even with the existing cast. What was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality. Here they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close. Of course they would have had to find a visionary Director and DP to bring the thing off successfully, but everything else was already in place for this to happen.",House of Wax
74,ctomvelu1,Abomination,1,13 October 2009,"The title suggests this is a remake of the 1950s classic starring Vincent Price, which in turn was a remake of an early talkie with a similar title starring Lionel Atwill. But not so. This HOUSE is just another cheap flick about young people getting lost in the hinterlands and murdered in various brutal ways, a sort of terrible sequel to a film like THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (I am thinking specifically of the Renee Zellwegger atrocity) or LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (the recent remake of which wasn't half-bad, by the way). A bunch of young-uns get lost and end up in a strange backwoods movie set standing in for a small village or town. Turns out there's a madman converting the living into wax figures, and with which he is populating the village. He starts doing the same to the bunch of lost young'uns, headed up by Elisha Cuthbert and Paris Hilton (!). Nasty stuff happens, my favorite being one of the guys getting his Achilles tendon sliced -- unfortunately that was done in at least one other movie from the same period. Otherwise, there isn't anything in this movie you haven't already seen in FINAL DESTINATION, HOSTEL, SAW and CABIN FEVER, the one where some kids get lost in the woods and proceed to melt. Truly awful. The acting was better in various Friday THE 13TH movies, if you can believe it. I'd say it's worth hanging in to see Hilton get hers. But it isn't.",House of Wax
75,raulfaust,House of Death,8,22 January 2012,"Well, I saw this film years ago and didn't remember how good it was. ""House of Wax"" is great teen horror film, a thousand times better than the overrated considered classic ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". The story sometimes is similar, but this picture is better in every aspect. The acting here is surprisingly good, I didn't expect to be this professional. The story is very original and creative, thought sometimes it's not very plausible. I remember that back when this picture was released, Paris Hilton's acting was very criticized in the whole world, but seeing it now, I didn't find it that bad-- obviously it's not great either. The special effects are quite believable for a movie with such relatively low budget, I have no idea of how they made the house-on-fire scene. One thing I have to really congratulate the filmmakers is the soundtrack; it is EXTREMELY good, the songs are amazing and they all fit in the scene they've been chosen to play at. Deftones, My Chemical Romance, Marilyn Manson-- my first contact with these GREAT bands was in this film. Directing is another positive aspect of this movie, it is very capable to scare and entertain the spectator, never being predictable or obvious. All in all, THIS should be considered a teen classic instead of that lousy ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"".",House of Wax
76,Matt_Layden,"""Admit it...you wanted to see Hilton die too""",5,3 November 2005,"A group of friends on their way to a college football game falls prey to a pair of murderous brothers in an abandoned small town. They discover that the brothers have expanded upon the area's main attraction... the House of Wax. And created an entire town filled with the wax-coated corpses of unlucky visitors. Now the group must find a way out before they too become permanent exhibits in the House of Wax...Chalk up another film for the remake list of classic horror movies. Although in this installment, there is a lack of one, Vincent Price. Instead we get who todays teenagers think are hot. If Paris Hilton running across the screen in her underwear is what Hollywood deems as a horror movie these days, then we are in trouble.When you think of a teen horror movie you think of a bunch of kids who get lost and are killed by a psycho. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of 1,000 corpses and so on. House of Wax is no different in that sense of the word, but it does stand out from the rest of the bunch. Serra is able to keep suspense throughout this film, whereas other seem to fizzle out.Wax doesn't throw horror at us from the start, instead it takes a good 30 some odd minutes before we get the scares that we would expect. Serra manages to slowly get the creepy feeling into the viewer, as we see the town and get the eerie feeling from that very moment we see it.Chad Micheal Murray and Elisha Cuthbert lead the cast in in every sense of the word, as they are the only watchable characters. Jon Abrahams has too little screen time to make an impression. Of course Paris Hilton nails the role perfectly, because she is in fact that in real life, so there is no stretch for her. For us, or at least speaking for myself, she was only eye-candy. When she bites the dust, and eventually they all do, minus the leads (come on it's a horror movie, you had to see it coming) I got a warm feeling of satisfaction.The one villain, Vincent, obvious ode to Price, was quite creepy, with his long black hair and wax face. A Micheal Myers type feel to it, for the new wave of horror movies.The gore is here and it is good, we actually see it up on the screen. Too many horror movies feel the need to cut away right before and only show the characters reaction, in order to get the PG-13...here we get Serra using the R title to it's extent.The film tries to hard with it's ""shocking"" ending, but one can see it coming from the very start, which brings the film down because it does take itself seriously. If it had a little bit more fun with itself, then the camp could have settled in and we would have enjoyed ourselves a lot more. The climax of the film has the House of Wax melting with our killers and teen like characters in it. I was impressed with the whole execution of it, it worked really well while keeping the suspense and horror. Although in the end, Wax just passes by as another teen remake of an old classic horror film, this will be forgotten, even if it's better then the trash that it's forgotten with.",House of Wax
77,vengeance20,An Epic film!,9,24 December 2015,"I heard about this film from when I was 11 back in '05. Though I was too young to watch it & not a horror guru I never let on it until now. I bought this film from Hmv last year & never got round to watching it though it still kept luring me into watching it & I did!The film was truly great & very underrated by pompous critics! The story starts in 1974 with a mum making a wax model in the kitchen while her twin son is eating breakfast, her other son who is volatile get's strapped to a chair & smacked, in 2005, a group of friend on the way to a football game & camp out in the wood near a forgotten town made out of wax & anamatronics! They then get side tracked when on of their cars get damaged by a mysterious man in a pick up truck the night before & stumble across the town that is like that of a 1950's Atom Bomb test zone!They then come across 'The House Of Wax' Muse m & as usual like with any other horror film (which ain't bad) venture in & get picked off 1 by 1 by Vincent Sinclair. It is revealed they were conjoined twins & Vincent was the one who got the worse as part of his face is disfigured while his brother isn't. The film was pretty epic for kills & chills! It was gory too & had a great showdown at the end! The house being made entirely of wax was just ace! The killer, Vincent Sinclair was a creepy f**ker too 7 pretty scary! I loved the mask he made for himself & the dreary backstory!I overall thought this was a great film which is epic! 9/10",House of Wax
78,screenman,Gets On Your Wick,3,20 January 2009,"This genre is clearly not aimed at the likes of me for a target audience, so maybe I shouldn't comment, or at least take it seriously. It represents a fashion than began back in the 1950's to encourage or mitigate flirtatious shenanigans in the back-row of cinemas or drive-in's. And for the sort of shallow, adolescent, hedonistic dimwits portrayed here, there are presumably their equals in the real world who can identify with them and shudder.I knew they were going to get short shrift. I didn't care a toss. So that was that. It's loonies at large and innocents abroad. It must have been done a hundred times by now, if it's been done once. There's all the gore, all the blood, and all of the clichés that the unimaginative could wish for.And all of this takes place in an abandoned small town - of which the USA seems to be largely composed beyond New York, LA and San Francisco.This small town has got a colossal wax museum. And we eventually discover that it really is made from wax. Yep: they just shipped-in about ten thousand tons of the stuff and lovingly built an entirely authentic and believable structure from scratch. It's got an auditorium with full seating, it's been wired for lighting, and its even got a full-screen projection facility like any other cinema. Bette Davis's 'Baby Jane' is the main feature. Believe me; that's a much better movie.How did they do it? How does it stand upright - especially in strong sunshine? How long would it take for two people to accomplish such a feat of labour and art? And this as well as dozens of other grisly human-wax exhibits throughout the town. How many people did they murder? Why were no questions asked? Why didn't the local police at least show some passing interest in all of these strange goings-on at this supposedly deserted hamlet? This kind of movie is not intended for the enquiring mind. You're not supposed to ask questions. Just watch, squeal, cuddle and grope as the juvenile propensity for hedonistic excess dictates. Mature observers should look elsewhere.On the Message Board, there is a thread beginning 'Which victim was killed the worst?'

Even Paris Hilton is not bad as I imagined her to be in the role of Paige. There is gore,action and you can find many disturbing scenes. It's not the best horror movie,but it's okay.One negative thing in the movie: When Carly had her thumb chopped off, I found that the actress didn't look someone who had just lost her finger. I mean,in the situation the pain must be awful and she didn't convinced at all.But there is a great scene(my favorite to be honest,and also the most bizarre in my opinion): When Wade,Carly's boyfriend, is already covered with wax and Danton,his friend,tries to get the wax off his face was SO disturbing: you can see all of his blood,meat and even some of the nerves of his face there!",House of Wax

Some of the gore was pretty decent for people who need this, to find a horror movie appealing enough. Paris chase/death is surprisingly good and one of the best parts. The acting is sensible. Mostly good performances came from Elisha Cuthbert, Jared Padalecki and Brian Von Holt. Chad Michael Murray being a « badder » counterpart to Lucas Scott.

83,xredgarnetx,Surprisingly scary,9,14 January 2006,"Considering the filmmakers basically appropriated the name of one of Hollywood's most famous horror flicks for what amounts to little more than a gory slasher movie, HOUSE OF WAX is surprisingly inventive and tense and scary. Some teens get lost in the woods, and eventually come across a small town where nothing is at it seems. If this sounds like Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or WRONG TURN or even HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES, that's because it is very similar. The director counterbalances the clichés with some inventive killings and dismemberment. The final battle, in a house literally made of wax that begins melting in a fire, is where the whole thing comes apart. It is all too silly. Take away the wax element of this plot and you have a standard teens versus slasher in the woods flick. The only familiar name in the cast, Paris Hilton, is basically wasted.",House of Wax

Yes, this film is cheesy, predictable and, let's face it, anything with Paris Hilton in an acting role hardly inspires confidence, but as a fright and gore-fest, it's not bad at all. For pure entertainment value, I would say 'House of Wax' is better than most modern-day horror movies.This film certainly isn't short of the stereotypes you expect from the slasher sub-genre, but it makes up for it with some well-crafted scare scenes and an effectively tense and suspenseful atmosphere throughout. The acting is surprisingly decent and there's plenty of gore to keep slasher fans entertained.Comparing 'House of Wax' to other similar horror/slasher films, it's not that bad at all.

86,baumer,"Surprisingly violent, and lots of fun.",8,18 October 2005,"While HOUSE OF WAX will never be mistaken for Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it does try and ultimately succeed in being a worthy addition to quality horror film making. There is enough tension and enough implied gore in here to please the young audience of today and there is also enough explicit gore to please some of the purists of yesterday. Overall, it is quite a well done film that should do okay on DVD.Six kids on the way to a football game get stranded in a DELIVERANCE like setting and what ensues actually looks like it may have been taken out a discarded Deilverance sequel and the backwoods hicks seem to taunt the group. Eventually the group has to break up and half of them head into the desolate town to get some car parts. The other half of the group stays behind at camp and this sets up the second half of the film.House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that it is blessed with a very likable cast. Paris Hilton is fine in her role but she is far from the focal point. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds some panache, some credibility and some flair. I had never really heard of Chad Michael Murray, only that he was a pin-up type teen heartthrob. But he has a presence to him. He imbues an intangible to him that seems to translate into his performance. He is instantly likable and he possesses a strong character trait. I enjoyed his performance much more than I figured I would and when he was on screen, the film flowed.The question now becomes, ""Is this film a worthy horror film?"" And the answer to that is a resounding YES. As I mentioned off the top, it is not in the same class a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, or even THE RING, but it is relatively tense, quite graphic and there are some very inventive death scenes. This is not the HOUSE OF WAX that your parents told you about. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen and when you start seeing fingers being cut off and hot wax covering comatose bodies, you realize this film is a little on the edge.I'd like to see an uncut director's X rated version. I bet there is one out there somewhere that would be much more violent than this one. Be that as it may, this is a very good entry into the horror genre and it is heads and shoulders above weak films like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and DARK WATER and a few others. It is definitely worth a look.8/10",House of Wax

88,TOMASBBloodhound,About as good as they come these days.,7,16 November 2005,"House of Wax is a surprisingly effective horror film. After a sluggish first twenty minutes, the film kicks into high gear and becomes a stylish, and unexpectedly gory tale. The plot gives us the usual group of unassuming young people who naturally find out that their shortcut has led them into someone's evil domain. I suppose if characters like these ever learn not to take back roads and not to split up, then these films would not get made. Since these scenarios have been seen in so many other films, it's simply up to the filmmakers to provide interesting ways for their characters to die. House of Wax is a film that meets and exceeds those expectations.On their way to a big football game, this group of youngsters stumbles onto a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. Much to their dismay, these youngsters learn that the town has only two living inhabitants. And these two are up to no good. They have spent years creating a wax museum filled with people they've murdered who are now covered with a wax shell. It appears that hundreds of unsuspecting people have stumbled onto this town and become permanent wax fixtures. The question is: How many of our characters will suffer this same fate? Watch and find out! I was most impressed with the technical aspects of the film. The finale which has our remaining heroes battling the two killers as the wax house melts around them is astonishingly well-filmed. A very nice effort by a first time director. And with producers like Joel Silver and Bob Zemeckis looking over his shoulder, and $30 million of the studio's money on the line, he had to deliver.The film reminds me of a more gory and technically up to date version of Tourist Trap. That 1979 film was more atmospheric, but it didn't deliver the goods in terms of blood like this one does. I guess you could say that Paris Hilton would be the equivalent of what Tanya Roberts was to that film. A hot chick just there for eye candy until she has to die. If I was the studio (scary thought) I would have told them to write out one of the male characters and add another female. It just seemed like there were too many male victims. Males don't make as effective victims as females in horror films because it's easier to project fear onto a female character.Still, this is a pretty neat film.7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",House of Wax

House Of Wax, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good original music, good cinematography, good production design, good art direction and makeup and effects. House Of Wax, is your fairly typical teen horror film where all the characters make all the wrong moves and the film tries to scare by having people creep up and by using loud noises but I enjoyed the film nonetheless. The film (which often looks and feels like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is a good looking film with some great visuals (especially in the last half) and some good sets and is a fun film. While you can see what films this one has used for influences it is still fairly original, is well paced, fairly clever and is very entertaining. Also unlike most horror films these days House Of Wax, is not scared to show a little gore and blood or be released with an R rating. This is the fifth film by the fairly recent production company Dark Castle Entertainment, and from the films I have seen by them they aren't usually very good but I was actually surprised by this one. House Of Wax, is full of energy both on and off the screen and gets better as it goes along and it sure had me entertained and it looks and feels like a 70's slasher film and has all the fun of one as well.",House of Wax

That is my one of my favorite slasher horror films that come out from year 2000 I am not really in to 2000's horror films, but this movie, My Bloody Valentine, The Hills Have Eyes remakes, than The Collector and of course just recently Don't Breathe horror movies that come out last year are my favorite horror films and I think they are very solid and decent good films. This film doesn't deserve the hate, people knew who Paris Hilton was, R-rated horror movies were actually being released in theaters more than they were today, and horror movies were being remade left and right. I love this movie it has a solid cast from actors like are Elisha Cuthbert from 24 she played Kiefer Sutherland's daughter Kim, Chad Michael Murray from One Tree Hill, Jared Padalecki from Supernatural as Sam Winchester and of course 2009 remake Friday the 13th and of course Paris Hilton my girlfriend is fan of Paris Hilton. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who also directed Liam Neeson my favorite film Non-Stop and of course The Shallows I like that shark flick. This movie is produced from Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future)House of Wax a 2005 offering from producer Joel Silver (Die Hard, Demolition Man and Road House) which is obviously a remake of the classic Vincent Price classic from 1953. This version works quite well as a group of young adults find themselves stuck and the small town of Ambrose may be there only hope to find the repairs they need for the broken down car. But, the curiosity of some of the group gets the better of them as they stroll through the town and begin to disappear one by one. The mysterious and totally wack ed out town mechanic turns vile and a freakish zombie like dude begins creating his ""house of wax"" out of the living. I love this movie I watch it today and I was hooked of how good it is and I don't understand the low rating at all. I love the scenes in which Paris Hilton takes a pipe in her head that was brilliant. I love the music score by John Ottman he did a good score. I enjoy this movie I love that there are two main heroes and sole survivors Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and Nick (Chad Michael Murray) I love the ghost town that everything is out of wax. Even all puppets are out of wax.Vincent (Brian Van Holt) who has Wax face mask is a creepy psycho scary killer like was Michael Myers I hate the character, but I love that this movie has a happy ending on the end. In this movie, 2005's biggest and hottest names take a trip to go see a football game until their car breaks down. They're forced to take camp at some field, and Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray eventually stumble upon the dreaded HOUSE OF WAX. Slowly but surely, each of the teenagers that tagged along get picked off in horrifying, gruesome ways, Paris Hilton's being my favorite. The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD horror rated-R film one of my all time favorite I am always hooked up on this movie.

91,jpschapira,Non-stop entertainment...,7,17 August 2005,"I have explained my position about horror movies before; many times. I don't hate all horror movies, I've seen a few that I love but then there are not lots of them which captured me or anything similar. Less during these days, where groups of young people go somewhere and by different reasons gets killed. All of them except for the ones who'll be the survivors; the heroes or however you prefer to call it.These films are either remakes or original new stories. I haven't seen them all, but I know; ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Amityville Horror"" and just to avoid making the list longer, one I recall watching called ""Wrong Turn"". Some boys and girls had a problem in the road and were chased by ""human monsters"" in the forest. I believed two of them survived.Now this other one, ""House of Wax"", a remake of an old movie I didn't see. So I won't make comparisons, I'll just take on the recent picture; where some boys and girls have a problem in the road andAnd I'm not telling anything because you know it and you know it better, I believe, if you saw the old version. However the case, what I always say is that I don't mind the ending in a horror film because it's impossible to change it, but I mind the way the filmmakers get to it.The last time I checked (""Wrong Turn"", I have in mi head how bad it is) the people barely knew each other and they were killed without a reason, or in other words, I couldn't figure why those ""human monster"" killed them; it was totally nonsense. This of course works for those crazy horror fans, who love to see blood all over places and heads getting cut, and so on. That's why horror films always get the best of directors, visually speaking.All of this is included in ""House of Wax"", but with extra ingredients. These ingredients are the ones that attract a person like me, who's not in only for the things I said before. The blood, the deaths, everything occurs, but for a reason. So, the killers are brothers, Bo and Vincent (both played convincingly by Brian Van Holt), and their story goes way back, and their motives departure from that storyThere's also confrontations between the brothers, and between the youngsters, who are not extremely close, but in a way share strong bonds.And I wonder what would have been of these characters in other actors' skin. I say it because anyone knows by now what a good actress Elisha Cuthbert is. She is very solid in her role in this film and right now I'm praying God so that she leaves her hair the way she is wearing it in the movie. Like Elisha, Chad Michael Murray is known for his beauty, but he possesses the gifts and the personality to create defined roles. If you were wondering, Paris Hilton works perfectly, at least for what she needs to do. The cast is completed by the versatile Jon Abrahams, the monotone but charming Jared Padalecki and the rigid Robert Ri'chard. Teens go to see the movie because they think these persons are cute, but they forget they are professionals.Then in my words the result is: non-stop entertainment. Brothers Hayes take a step into the different side, and get their credit for making the ride not as stubborn as it could have been. The Spanish ""beginner"" Jaume Collet-Serra doesn't seem a beginner at all, because he's feature looks simply beautiful, and that has to be a unanimous judgment. He created his own detailed world and even if it would lead to my death, I would like to see it.",House of Wax
92,Sir_AmirSyarif,Formulaic but fairly well-done,6,10 August 2020,"Formulaic but fairly well-done, this surprisingly creepy take on a wax museum has a very creepy atmosphere that works well with the plot of the movie. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, the special effects are very impressive and suitably gory enough to send a chill down your spine. The slow start quickly burns brighter with heart-stopping chase sequences. What it lacks in performance and gore, it makes up for in atmosphere and dread.",House of Wax
93,Son_of_Mansfield,The Ambrose Wax Massacre.,6,17 March 2006,"So, now instead of simply ruining a movie by remaking it, we will pretend to remake one movie while actually remaking a completely different film. Genius! Thank You. This is basically The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with wax statues and Paris Hilton, although in some scenes I had trouble figuring out which was which. My favorite part was the house of wax, which actually was a house of wax and the scene where it melted, groovy. The worst aspects of this movie, besides the acting, are the boneheaded dialogue and the profound stupidity of the characters. Both are on display in the scene where Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray check out that old lady in the window. ""The whole town is rigged,"" she says. Really! Here I was thinking that not only would one old lady be left in the town, but she would stand at the window all day opening the curtains every few seconds and she would probably be more than willing to help seeing as she lives in town full of wax statues with dead people in them. Watch this for the gore(he peeled Wade's face off!) or to laugh at the screenwriter's ""work."" P.S. The best scene is the death of Paris Hilton's character, who is impaled by the head on a large pole. From what I have seen on the internet, this is not new to her.",House of Wax
94,Superunknovvn,Pleasant surprise,6,10 July 2005,"I did not expect anything when I walked into this movie. Another remake of a classic horror flick in a time where too many mediocre remakes had already been made. In fact, I thought this was going to be king of them all, this year's most likely Razzie Award winner. Well, the truth is ""House Of Wax"" entertained me. A lot.Although this movie hasn't much to do with the original, the story still seems old. The whole setting was taken straight out of the ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake and ""Wrong Turn"", the characters were as faceless and unrealistic as usual. Actually, the plot is outright stupid up until and including the final ""twist"", and details should not be questioned. On the other hand, story and character development clearly aren't what movies like this one are about. The gore, oh, the gore was magnificent and visually the director made as much as possible out of the premise of a horror house where people are waxed to death (if you can put it that way). Another thing I liked a lot was that characters often acted like you wanted them to. Like, if someone's got a baseball bat in his/her hands he beats the villain in the face with it until the guy can't get up anymore. And we see it all in detail. Call me perverted, but I really enjoyed that.No, this is not a film for the history books and as expected it's no genre cornerstone, but it's a hell of a lot better than you might think. If you like good old-fashioned horror with random acts of senseless violence and just a tiny bit of sex - Paris Hilton is in this movie for a reason and Elisha Cuthbert almost looks as hot as Jessica Biel when being chased through a forsaken, rotten town by a serial killer - ""House Of Wax"" is the movie you should go and see.",House of Wax
95,jessegehrig,You can interpret this to be a movie review,1,2 January 2016,"As I write this I am also watching this movie- real time, motherf*ckers! Some of the characters in this movie have SEX! Sex is what animals do for biological reason. Sex is what people do for : money, cocaine, ego support, to get back at a parent or parents, boredom, because it's socialized behavior, because of a sexual assault from the past and the trauma of that event has yet to be fully processed and dealt with, also some humans have sex to share intimacy, whatever intimacy is in the Age Of Social Media. Yes, bald apes slapping their genitals together in mindless fury, with cycles of abuse and incest to be repeated generation after generation, sounds like a great plan to me, House of Wax.",House of Wax
96,acidburn-10,Only has one thing in common with the original,6,1 April 2008,"I don't know why ""House Of Wax"" is classed as a remake of the original House Of Wax, because this House Of Wax is completely different to the original, the original was more of a thriller and this one is an all out slasher movie. The only thing that this has in common with the original is the fact that the killer kills his victims and turns them into wax dummies. In my opinion this movie shares more in common with ""Tourist Trap"", cause they both have the same premise, a bunch of teens getting stranded in the middle of nowhere and coming across a museum of life-like wax models, then end up getting stalked and killed by the creator of the wax dummies and becoming wax dummies themselves.I really liked this movie, the kills are inventive, the characters are likable, although a little slow to start but once the action kicks in, it well it kicks in and really packs a punch. The effects are on top form and plus we get 2 sexy babes Elisha Cuthbert and Paris Hilton, although I would have preferred to have seen a bit more skin from them and plus they should have added in an extra babe for good measures instead of having 4 men and just 2 women.Elisha Cuthbert (Carly) hit all the right notes she ran, screamed and kicked ass. Chad Michael Murray (Nick) played his part well as Carly's brother they both have a strong believable bond especially in the final scenes which really made his character stand out. Brian Van Holt (Bo/Vincent) was charismatic as the psychotic killer. Paris Hilton (Paige) can't act but she had the best death scene wouldn't have been the same without it. Jared Padalecki(Wade) was OK but I just didn't buy the chemistry he was supposed to have had with his girlfriend. Robert Richard (Blake) played the usual black token guy nothing special nor he wasn't very interesting either and Jon Abrahams (Dalton) what was the point of him they should have had another female cast member instead of him that would have been much better, I mean come on he brought absolutely nothing to this film.All in all a fun popcorn movie.",House of Wax
97,DonFishies,"Excels with gore, but barely tries on any other front",3,23 May 2006,"After numerous attempts at giving the horror genre a chance, I've just given up. All of the remakes of classic and not-so classic films, all of the original concepts that just turn out to be just as bad as the remakes, just everything that the horror genre attempts to throw at the modern filmgoing public, just does not work for me anymore. It's the same crap over and over again, and there is nothing new ever brought to the table. It's all been overdone, and just leaves me with a horrendous taste in my mouth. Coming to terms like this really helped me when I decided to watch the remake of House of Wax randomly. While I was not disappointed at all, I can't say that I the film really made me change my opinion on the state of horror either.House of Wax opens with a flashback to two boys being put into their high chairs for a meal. One acts completely nice, while the other is a total hell-raiser. This idea, of course, is intriguing, but as the film goes on, is only half-heartedly explained, and never brought to it's full potential.It continues on to reveal our main character Carly (Elisha Cuthbert), who is on the way to a big college football game with some of her friends, including Paige (the never useful Paris Hilton), her boyfriend Wade (Jade Padalecki) and her brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), among others. So basically, your basic pretty face, young cast.As the film progresses, they take the obvious shortcut that leads nowhere, so they camp out. A mysterious truck pulls up and creeps them out, before leaving after getting a beer bottle thrown at it. They decide to stay the night anyway, and when they wake up, Wade's car is out of commission, leading them to having to go into the nearest town to get the part to fix it. Of course, this only leads to trouble, and leads to the inevitable introduction of the titular House of Wax, and the psychopath and victims that go with it.Not much is given acting or plot wise of course. You basically know from the beginning who is going to live and die (through some clever ideas that are mentioned but obviously never explored), and you know how the whole thing will come together. It leaves no real room for any surprises, and no real room for the audience to really not know what's coming next. We've seen it all before, and nothing new is brought to the table. Yes, it tries to cut above with the real heavy plot elements, but as I've already pointed out, none are explored. I came to all sorts of conclusions and possibilities that I just never saw explored at all.Cuthbert, Murray and Padalecki have all seen better days. The little seen Jon Abrahams is a shining star here, but is sadly underused in the entire scheme of things. As has Brian Van Holt. Hilton of course, is useless in everything she does, so I was not surprised at how subtle her crappy performance was. Yes, we get to see what we all wanted (and more), but she just proves even more so here, how she's just a ditsy girl who just happens to be a hotel heiress. And of course, the profiteer of one of the most widely circulated pornographic videos on the Internet (and neither she, or that video, is that great in the first place!).Where this movie shines is the gore. Yes, the Saw films are intensely amped up with gore, but the majority of horror films now are rated PG-13, and have very little to no gore. This film, I'm pleasantly surprised to say, had quite a bit of blood being thrown around. No unique kills of course, but plenty of graphic scenes, and plenty of good makeup effects. While I was disappointed with the film overall, I really did enjoy the time put into making these effects so good. The waxed characters are just so intriguing created, that they probably look even more realistic on camera than they actually did in real life. Many of the settings and the sequence preluding the ending also demonstrate how they really put effort into some part of this film, and less in others. But while it really helped the film, there were way too many times that it really seemed like all it was willing to do was rip off anything that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake did (even making it look like the exact same film in some instances).While one part really excels, another just does not even make a real attempt at trying. Watch the film for a light laugh, and to get a look at some good effects that we rarely see shown in modern horror. Otherwise, it's just another crappy remake.3.5/10.",House of Wax
98,LoneWolfAndCub,"Finally, Back To The Good Ole' Days Of Slasher",6,22 July 2005,"House Of Wax (directed by Jaume Collet-Serra) has had many bad reviews. Why? I ask. This isn't a terrible movie. It is a typical slasher flick. Many of the old fogies that review this give one or none. Which it clearly doesn't deserve.I saw it on opening day in Australia (July 14th) at a night session. Most were silent during this. Up until the long awaited death of Paris Hilton as expected, a few cheers here and there. I walked out realising I hadn't seen a great movie but an enjoyable one.The plot is typical of a slasher. Group of kids going to a football game experience car trouble. Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) go to the town of Ambrose to get a fan-belt, while Paige (Paris Hilton), her boyfriend Blake, Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and his comical friend Dalton stay put.Carly and Wade go to the House Of Wax and this is when trouble starts. From here on the cast get knocked off one by one in gory, bloody ways.This movie is great for one reason, it returns to the good old slasher films. Gory deaths are a-plenty in this movie. Acting is OK for a slasher. Cuthbert is a good leading lady, most of the men (and Hilton) are there for looks.3/5",House of Wax

This is another horrible remake and a horrible film in general that made me almost quit watching in the opening credits. I literally watched this film just to make fun of it and watch it because of all of Paris Hilton's publicity she got from the film. This is just like any other horror film. It has to be extremely gory and it has to make the villains impossible to kill, just so the movie can be more scarier. When are they going to stop making these cheap films with handsome heroes that have no acting talent and beautiful actresses to play the main leads? It will never end. Overall, this is a pathetic slasher film that pretty much made me laugh in every scene of how bad it was.Hedeen's Outlook: 1/10 No stars F",House of Wax
100,EmperorNortonII,"Too Much Bloody ""Wax""",6,25 May 2005,"Yet another in a long line of horror remakes, ""House of Wax"" goes more extreme in its graphic depiction than the original could have. The story follows a group of young people who stumble upon a creepy little town in the middle of nowhere, and discover a wax museum with a terrible secret. All the while, a psycho pair of twin brothers are out to add the newcomers to the big exhibit. The violence is too bloody and graphic, it makes you cringe. Paris Hilton's appearance in the movie is probably meant to be the main box office draw for this movie. If that's so, the producers are hoping to cash in on her quasi-celebrity. If you're into overly bloody horror, you might enjoy ""House of Wax."" Otherwise, stay away!",House of Wax

Don't let that put you off, she's hardly in the film at all.The film involves Robert Zemikis (Back To The Future, Gremlins) and Joel Silver (Gothika, The Matrix, Ghost Ship) so you know it's going to be half decent.Take a bunch of clean cut looking college students who are trying to get to a football game. That really isn't important because they are never going to get there.Apart from Paris Hilton, I don't know any of the rest of the cast. Take the idea from the original 1950's Vincent Price version of House Of Wax. A bad person is catching people and turning them into wax statues by coating them in wax while they are still alive.Except this is 2 brothers. Who you later find out were Siamese or conjoined twins. What you are also told is that 2 of the group of students are also twins but they are brother and sister.The entire House Of Wax is actually made of wax and is destroyed at the end of the movie, and that sequence looks stunning.The students that are killed all get fairly convincing looking deaths. The movie also makes use of Paris Hilton's notoriety and her ""sex movie scandals"" with the use of the video camera to catch her doing things that look like they are sexual but prove to be totally innocent.On the whole the film looks excellent, but runs a little slow in places.Give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised that you like it like I was.",House of Wax

For one thing the presence of Hilton was just annoying (she has money, but no talent) and story-wise the movie felt all too familiar. Yet now when I review this movie again, it really seems more and more like one of the better horror films of 2005. While House of Wax does have some flaws, it also has a number of good qualities going for it too. The story does boast some good suspense, much of the cast isn't bad, the art direction is awesome, and the special FX are truly outstanding. The murder sequences in this film are quite good, allowing plenty of gore for the shock-fans. The FX for the climax are very impressive as well! The direction is slick and the soundtrack has some good rock numbers to boot.Cast-wise the film isn't bad either (except for Ms. Hilton of course). Elisha Cuthbert makes for a likable heroine, Chad Michael Murray does a good bad-boy performance as the bother, Brian van Holt is good as our villain, and Jared Padalecki is solid in the role of Cuthbert's ill-fated boy friend.So in retrospect House of Wax is a good time for horror fans, or those that would just like to see Ms. Hilton meet the wrong end of a spear.*** out of ****",House of Wax

Recent horror films like Wrong Turn and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have already covered this territory. However, this doesn't stop House of Wax from being an enjoyable and entertaining horror film. For starters, the story and characters have a lot more depth than recent slasher films. Instead of just rushing into the murders, the film moves at a slow pace and actually introduces the characters. The audience will actually feel sympathy for them later on since they aren't all one dimensional. Jaume Serra keeps the first half of the film bloodless yet still engaging and he manages to make the second half pretty suspenseful. I'm glad he took this route and it made the film a lot better than I was expecting.The acting is pretty good for this type of film with the best being Elisha Cuthbert. Her performance isn't amazing but she's easy to like and she also has an engaging quality that draws the viewer's attention to her. Chad Michael Murray gives an okay performance, nothing special. Jared Padalecki also gives an okay performance, again, nothing special. Paris Hilton just plays herself and she does an okay job. However, she's easily the worst out of everyone. Jon Abrahams just gives an annoying performance and his character isn't really needed.While the characters are developed, some of them are still kind of stupid. I know this is a horror film but some of their actions just left me confused. There were a lot of ""don't do that"" moments but this was kind of expected. The death scenes were pretty nice and stylish. There were some creative ones that are worth checking out. The killers looked scary and they were pretty effective. The ending was kind of disappointing though. I loved watching the whole museum melt down and it looked awesome but the ending still felt a little to simple. Also, I hope they do make a sequel since they left it open for one. In the end, House of Wax is a solid horror film that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10",House of Wax

While Carly and Nick, (brother and sister), and two other friends go off to find help, they find a deserted town. The main feature of the town is a big wax museum. They finally find one in this town who agrees to help Carly and Nick, there other friend have gone missing, then everything goes wrong for this group of friend. There is not only one man in this town, a wax masked man is running around, picking them off one by one, turning them wax sculpture to add to his wax collection.When i saw House Of Wax, i was the only person in the theater. I must say being in a dark room by myself was more creepy than the movie. But i was abit surprised with this movie. I wasn't taking in much faith for this, and while it doesn't make a great film it still has some credit.I haven't seen the originals, but i have read this isn't like the others so you didn't need prior knowledge. This was like many of other slashers, but it took a lot of time to set things up. Though there isn't much character development; but in slasher films that never matters really when you think about it. But they take time to explore the town and surroundings, and the town is quite impressive. The wax museum was really good. The whole set design and the concept of encasing people in wax is a very interesting idea.Though the set design is great, the acting takes away from it. All the acting is very poor and retarded. Every one say Paris Hilton's acting is the worst acting ever,(I don't think they have seen catwoman), she does an alright, but mediocre job. She did a much better job of acting than she did in the film 9 lives. But that said she should never act again. She's not in HOW for many scenes so you don't have to watch her all the time. Elisha Cuthbert just runs around in circles and Chad Michael Murray gruffs his way through.Though house of wax may be the bottom of the barrel of a slasher films, you could be watching something worse.",House of Wax
113,Danny_G13,Highly original if overly gory,7,17 September 2005,"Teen horror movie is far more intelligent than its peers, but overdoes the gore factor.House of Wax seems to be, on the surface, yet another teen slasher horror movie. The obligatory gorgeous cast with the stereotypical 'freaks' along them in the plot hardly serve to suggest this is anything more.Even the notion of the bad guys having their 'domain' has been done before to death, particularly by the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series.However, the mere fact that the domain itself is quite original and genuinely effective allow this one to be a cut above others.Elisha Cuthbert is the main star here, and she plays Carly, happily in love with Wade. Together they're with a group of their friends off to see some kind of sports game. The route there is blocked off and things begin to take a turn for the worse after they camp overnight.Suffice to say it becomes a battle for survival against the evil killers determined to claim the gang as their own.The acting is generally OK, but then Elisha is a half decent actress as are her co-stars Chad Michael Murray and...errr Paris Hilton. Yes, a much publicised aspect of this film is Hilton's major role in it as Paige. She's not exactly awful but she's no actress. Thankfully her part is decidedly undemanding and the most notable piece of it is her also highly publicised striptease. Which, as we know, she's a master of.The direction struggles to begin with, and the story actually seems quite old before it gets into gear. The pace is just a bit pedestrian and unprogressive and by the time the location of the title actually comes into its own, the film feels like it's been going a long time. It does pick up though after this, and actually serves the movie quite well.The violence is definitely not for the squeamish. There are multiple incredibly gory sequences in this with explicit levels of blood and guts. I'm surprised this was only a 15 in the UK - it seemed fitting of an 18. Frankly a few of the sequences had me slightly cringing, and some of the realism of the violence is the most convincing I've seen.The plot itself is fairly decent once it gets running, and without question it's highly original in its outline. Without giving too much away, this is one movie where kills are unique.Overall it's a decent enough movie with a modicum of originality and lashings of gore. If you can stomach the latter you can enjoy the former.",House of Wax
114,Cinema_Fan,What a Carry On.,1,4 November 2005,"My wife and I haven't laughed so much at a horror movie since we first saw the classic and the best produced Carry On movie, Carry On Screaming!, or Carry On Vampire Screaming in the States. Hold on, House of Wax was not meant to a comedy? Oh dear, oh dear.What a Comedy of Error's. Personally I never realised that Paris Hilton was in this film, if I had then I would have thought twice about going. I have seen cardboard boxes act with more personality, charisma, talent, intelligence and professionalism. What a complete embarrassment to the great Actor's and Actresses of year's gone by. The rest of the cast are just as poor, (to be honest, down right talent less to the hilt-on), maybe to make Hilton look that less incapable, but believe me; she does not need any help from anyone. This could have been a good movie if the cast, acting, direction, backdrops etc were changed. This extremely predictable story line and wooden acting actually does deserve some praise, it should receive the Wooden Spoon award. Terrible, terrible. Containing no originality and talent any where of any kind what so ever, this film is definitely for those who are very much easily pleased, to enjoy this film is to show a complete lack of self respect for one's intelligence and a very long climb back up the ladder of evolution is very much advised.There is making Movies, and there is movie Making. This film is neither, this is celluloid meltdown. Stay Away or watch at your own peril.You've been warned.",House of Wax
115,PeterRoeder,Overrated!,5,1 November 2005,"I think house of wax is greatly overrated in reviews on IMDb. it's nothing special. 5/10. a little better than other recent American horror. nothing more. the first 30 minutes we are all ready let down again to think that this is another teenage-movie rather than teenage-HORROR-movie (such as Friday the 13th). i thought the last hour was really good though. the edgar allan poe ending was awesome. the effects were very good. Paris Hilton is very hot-looking and the other actress is cute as well. i just think the movie should have signalled that it was a horror movie from the beginning rather than a ""young-americans-are-cool-movie"" like the lame movie Monsterman which i cannot recommend to anyone. but this movie is actually better than most other recent movies such as the boogeyman.",House of Wax

Though here the villain kills people and makes wax figures out of them, this is basically another little slasher movie.Some of the scenes are indeed violent and shocking, none actually scary though. Elisha Cuthbert looked very beautiful and became the major attraction to watch the film. The scenes involving the wax figures were fun to watch. And...

117,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Paris Hilton and Elisha Cuthbert are the best of the film really underrated Horror R-rated film,8,4 May 2019,"One of my favorite horror films of all time, House of Wax a 2005 offering from producer Joel Silver (Die Hard) is a remake of Vincent Price 1953 film. This version works quite well as a group of young adults find themselves stuck and the small town of Ambrose may be there only hope to find the repairs they need for the broken down car. But, the curiosity of some of the group gets the better of them as they stroll through the town and begin to disappear one by one. The mysterious and totally wacked out town mechanic turns vile and a freakish zombie like dude begins creating his ""house of wax"" out of the living.House of Wax starts off like some up-dated friday the thirteenth movie where the drinking, sex starved youngsters will get whats comming to them for these atrocious crimes. But it changes quickly into a very good horror flick with some really creepy characters. The acting is quite good, Paris Hilton and Elisha Cuthbert are the best of this film. Paris stays with what she knows best... a little strip tease. I love this film to death. Chad Michael Murray as Nick, Carly's brother is a bad-ass in this movie. Elisha Cuthbert is so hot and sexy and I am in love with her. I watched her in 24 (2001) with Kiefer Sutherland in tv hit show as Kim Bauer. I love sex, drinking, I love these group of friends who becomes attacked by a serial killer Vincent (Brian Van Holt) who makes wax figures out of his wictims.My all time favorite bad-ass horror film i love it.",House of Wax
118,marcus_stokes2000,If those wax figures look like they're alive... it's because they ARE!,8,11 May 2007,"*SPOILERS Of Wax* A group of six twentysomethings, Carly (Elisha Cuthbert), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki), her twin brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her best friend Paige (Paris Hilton), Paige's boyfriend Blake (Robert Ri'chard) and Nick's best friend Dalton (Jon Abrahams), who unwittingly gave Nick the reputation of 'bad boy' are on their way to a football match, and decide to stop for the night in the middle of the woods.During the night, they are visited by a mysterious person on an old pick-up, and they wake up to find one of the cars won't start. Despite their having another car to go away with, Wade wants to get the broken part and repair the car ASAP, as he doesn't want to leave his car there.A weird man takes some of them (Wade and Carly) to a quaint and silent little town called Ambrose, which has an impressive wax museum. Where the wax figures look... well, real.The two then meet with the mysterious Bo (Brian Van Holt) and they begin to find out the terror...I have to say I wasn't expecting a real lot from this; knowing Elisha's 'acting' from 24 (I was actually glad when she left that show) and not being a fan of Paris Hilton, I was left thinking it was a mediocre horror remake (read: The Hitcher 2007, Dawn Of The Dead 2004, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003) with the only plus being Hilton getting killed.What I got, though, is a different story; yes, the story has a beginning that we've already seen too many times (kids stranded in the wild, psycho lurking nearby), but this movie manages to give a few twists, like the fact that they are not actually 'stranded' (Blake's car is still working), it has quite the gore (appropriate for the situation, of course), a few good performances (surprisingly, Paris Hilton's is one of them - she actually made her character a likable ditz) and one of the creepiest town in horror movie history.In short, head and shoulders above the aforementioned tripe, and, like 2006's 'Hills Have Eyes', 2005's 'Amityville Horror' and 1990's 'Night Of The Living Dead', a very enjoyable remake.House Of Wax (2005): 8/10.",House of Wax

But the events that unfold find them running from the murderous brothers who manage the place.House of Wax is a film I've always loved. For horror fans, it delivers what its fans come for--gore, violence, a little sex and lots of wax. First-time director Jaume Collet-Serra lingers over the victims at lengths discomfortingly gratuitous even by slasher standards. It's scary, scream-and-squirm-inducing, and suspenseful, it's unequivocally good--and often downright great. Well-paced and, other than Hilton, capably acted, it also has a great sense of humour about itself.",House of Wax
121,revival05,The bar is so low,5,19 September 2009,"House of Wax is a slasher movie that gets a lot of bad rep, really for no other reason than that Paris Hilton is in it. Is it a bad movie? It is fairly bad, but she certainly makes no difference. She can't act, but neither can the majority of the actors in this movie. Then again, since when do we watch a slasher movie to see quality acting? To be fair, House of Wax is actually not a particularly horrible film either. This genre has such a low bar that a movie that's simply generic can be regarded as, maybe not good, but good enough since it ain't that bad. By ""that bad"", I could be referring to the 2008 Prom Night or Halloween Resurrection. Or maybe I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Or, say, Child's Play 3. Or any sequel to Friday the 13th (camp value aside). Take a pick.That is of course not to say I recommend this movie either. I'd just like to point out that it does have a plot with some kind of consistency. It's true that the movie is about moronic college kids going hiking in Texas Chainsaw Massacre-land, sure, and they do get slashed by an dehumanized killer in a mask, yeah, and there is sex and alcohol involved as well, alright, but it does actually take an hour or so before the kill count can begin. I appreciate that. Today's slasher movies are generally so bland and automatic that they don't even bother with introducing and rooting any characters to begin with. It's bloodshed within the first fifteen minutes that matters, who gets slashed is less important. In House of Wax there is actually a moderately impressive piece of character development. The most interesting crux of the movie is how it introduces a bad boy in the beginning, leading the audience to believe he is the obnoxious douche who will get it painfully, then eventually making his rough edges come into use while making him an anti-hero, having what it takes to defend himself and his twin sister against the killer. Yes, it's uncommon, but the main characters of this movie aren't so much victims to the killer as they are the good guys fighting the bad guys. It is mentioned that the twin couple consists of the good and evil twin. This movie demonstrates a struggle between the good and evil twin couple.But that's probably giving this movie a little too much praise. It's not like it's an important theme throughout the movie or something, and come to think about it, it was probably theorizing I made up while the movie went on, since great stretches of it was just boring and obvious. I can figure that this movie might find one or two fans though. What does stand out is the art direction and the effects. The ghost town in which the movie takes place does look like a studio, but it's a pretty studio. And there is some impressive gore in this movie that will satisfy anybody who thought that One Night in Paris was in serious need of a pole through the brains.",House of Wax
122,SyoKennex,Moder Horror Classic,8,30 September 2017,"Growing up with the best horror films of this generation, prejudice against older films that are considered modern classics, is something that I find myself with quite a bit. I never really wanted to watch House of Wax, believing it to be just another old cheap scare that I wouldn't really enjoy. However, my soulmate brought it up in a conversation, and I remember seeing it in Blockbuster, years ago, when I was younger, and wanting to watch it then. Maybe that was just because it was a horror film and I was like ""lol, I'm a big kid now"", but the remembrance of this made me finally sit down and watch it.Despite the occasional cheap jump scare, this is actually a really well thought out film; with a good plot, and a story line that doesn't end up losing it's substance, I was thoroughly impressed.First, this started off very cheaply. It was your typical horror film starting, kids camping out in the forest, something going wrong, and a creepy guy in a truck. This all added up to seem to be another film filled with dumb, sex driven teenagers who were going to fall over from the guy with the chainsaw. However, once this actually started past the introduction, this started to get extremely nerve racking. Within moments of them stepping into the actual House of Wax, I had goosebumps all over my arms and creeping down my spine. I was shocked, and I felt the paranoia creeping up on me itself. Despite one or two jump scares, cheap and just there for the shock of being scared, this was all a really good beginning, with much more class than I cared to believe the film had before watching.As the story began to unravel and become more apparent with more clues as the story progresses, it reveals a story that has obviously had a lot of thought put into it, and really shocked me. Considering this was made 2004-2005, there was so much to this especially with the plot twists and with Vincent. I was truly in awe at just how well done this was, and honestly, I don't think I've ever found a more interesting story line within a horror film that has shocked me this much. The ending, was a little bit shaky. Although well rounded, with good acting, there was some parts that just really made me cringe, including Carly's weak attempt at psychological profiling with Vincent, but other than that, this was really, really a good end to the film. There was action, but not too much, the girls weren't completely helpless and managed to at least defend themselves for some time, and it was just really well rounded up. The characters in this were actually really interesting. A lot of characters in horror films are usually just big breasted women, and the big hunky jocks, to pull people in of all varieties. Although this did have that, the characters in House of Wax were well developed, seemed to have real, actual problems going on, and all had a relationship within each other that helped aid the subplot of the story to some degree. Going on from this, all of the actors did extremely well. I was honestly shocked at the acting quality. They all tried really hard for this film, and it's obvious that they worked at it. There was not a single character in this that I had trouble believing was a real person, that I could find among the real world.Overall, this was really creepy, and a lot scarier than I first thought – although the description makes it sound like a bit of a different film – I believed that the wax figures were alive, but maybe that was just my interpretation of what was written. I don't think I've seen a film from the 2000's that has actually scared me as much as this has, other than Mirrors (2008). I'd say this is definitely a horror film modern classic and it's a film I'm definitely going to rewatch again.",House of Wax
123,johnsmithjanuary-20081,Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibes,9,28 October 2021,Texas chainsaw massacre except instead of chainsaws its wax. An original concept despite having the same type of atmosphere as a lot of other main stream horror flicks.,House of Wax
124,happyendingrocks,It's hard not to giggle when the killer looks just like Nathan Explosion,6,4 October 2009,"This film bears so little resemblance to the Vincent Price classic that the title seems like an afterthought. Most of the film does too, for that matter.What's most striking about House Of Wax is how the glossy production makes the film look like a serious Hollywood offering, yet the finished product is not even a tier above the glut of slasher films that dominated the horror genre in the '80s. Granted, this is not necessarily a bad thing, as that period produced some personal and cult favorites. One's prospective enjoyment of House Of Wax really boils down to (Get it? ""Boils""? Like the wax? Oh, never mind...) how much fun this movie is. If that's all we're looking for here, then surely the film is at least mildly successful. But, if we're getting serious enough to write a review, a film like this must be judged under different criteria than, say, movies with actors in them. So if we're being honest, House Of Crap might be a more fitting moniker for this trenchant assortment of horror film clichés.I'm not willing to settle my write-up there, since House Of Wax generates a few good ideas that justify its existence. But the whole ""lipstick on a pig"" analogy works well here, because we're clearly supposed to believe that this slickly-made pulp piece has greater aspirations than providing 100 minutes of mindless diversion for those who enjoy watching a group of twenty-somethings get slaughtered in ten-minute increments. Okay, I'll play along...If House Of Wax were even remotely serious about being a ""real"" movie, surely we'd have some trained thespians on hand here. As it stands, the best we get is Jared Padalecki, who is a likable presence, but clearly mining the same emotional territory he found as Dean in ""Gilmore Girls"". Ditto with Elisha Cuthbert, who plays the same foolish damsel in distress we've seen her channel to single-handedly ruin entire seasons of ""24"". As for the ultra-gimmicky presence of Paris ""why are you famous again?"" Hilton, it's probably too nice to say that she was a more engaging actress in her sex tape than she is here (mind you, she answered her freaking cell phone during the sex).Indeed, Hiton's presence seems tailor-made for those who despise the vapid non-celebrity enough to harbor a secret desire to see her meet an untimely and gruesome end. If that's what you're looking for in House Of Wax, you'll certainly get your money's worth, but I still have to question why that pay-off justifies the time and effort spent here.Further, if the film-makers honestly had any ambitions of making us take this tripe seriously, they might have adjusted the script so that the characters we're supposed to seriously empathize with didn't actively seek their own demises by wandering into the woods alone at night, accepting rides from creepy strangers, and cleverly hiding in parked cars which offer no escape from the stalking, depraved killer.Perhaps we're supposed to cheer Elisha Cuthbert on while she valiantly struggles to escape the villain's murderous clutches, but we're instead left wondering why she doesn't just take on her would-be executioner and be done with it. After all, she is clearly blessed with superhuman healing abilities that allow her to shrug off a severed finger without even mild discomfort, and to separate her lips after they are sealed together with Krazy Glue without significant injury. With power like that, surely Cuthbert could have overcome the rampaging maniac stalking her and her friends, but she drags out the Perils Of Paulene act until the film crawls to a CGI-laden conclusion that seems inserted only to demand us to acknowledge that the producers of House Of Wax had a bigger budget than the producers who made The Burning. I'm just thankful they didn't spend it on a cougar to stalk Cuthbert with.So, let's stop playing around here. This is a C-grade slasher film wrapped in a pretty package, and once we're aware of this, we can start really evaluating House Of Wax.To be fair, the film has a bit of good news going for it. The story is nifty enough and there are at least a few moments of genuine gross-out nirvana. But that's truly all this film conjures, and it's really up to you to decide whether or not that tentative recommendation makes House Of Wax worthy of your time. They do score some extra points by including a scene from the superb Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? in the festivities, but it's highly unlikely that most of the people in this film's demographic have any idea what they're missing there.You could definitely do a lot worse. But, if a Paris Hilton strip tease and a few nice bits of gore are enough to make you pledge your allegiance, I could easily recommend at least 20 movies that should occupy your DVD player before this one does.If you've already seen all those, House Of Wax certainly serves its purpose as a decently-crafted bit of escapist slasher fare. Going in anticipating a finished product that reflects how many major studio dollars were flushed away while making it is a recipe for disappointment.Is this a recommendation? I suppose so, since I own House Of Wax and have put it into my DVD player at least twice. But expecting very little will reap great rewards here. Plus, I'm in that club that likes seeing Paris Hilton get a sharp instrument brutally rammed through her cranium, so my judgment is perhaps a bit impaled... Er, impaired.",House of Wax
125,shadowman123,mildly entertaining at best .,6,24 October 2005,"On the whole I found House of Wax to not be completely boring or a let down like most of the recent spade of Hollywood remakes . However still this films yet again retains a formula which is getting stressed and stretched to the point of it being tedious and boring , so the film can just make a lot of money of a really dumb teen audience rather than pleasing the old followers of the original . However House of Wax has got slightly better points because some parts of the film keep you hooked especially the murder of Paris Hilton , The opening sequence which promises a lot but sadly does not deliver and the way in which the wax sculptures are created . Apart from that just another stupid teen movie , with same hollow plot line but this time adding a hint of The Texas Chainsaw Massarce . Apart from that completely optional to check out just leave your brain at the door and don't expect Paris Hilton to do much and you'll be fine .

They camp, behave erratically and some get killed by the weird inhabitants of said town.Filled with horrible upbeat metal music, bad acting and slashing, this should be enough to make even the most ardent supporters of Ms. Hilton cringe.

128,CMRKeyboadist,Nothing like the Original,8,16 January 2006,"I will start by saying this movie is nothing like the classic starring Vincent Price. Other than the title and the name of one of the killers being called Vincent, this is a completely different film.A group of friends are traveling to see a football game in two vehicles. They decide to spend the night in the middle of nowhere. In the morning they find out that one of the vehicles is broken down and they need a certain part to fix it. The two lead actors in the movie hitch a ride with a very strange guy who leads them to a town which would appear to be deserted. In this town they find a house made completely out of wax and everything in it also is made of wax.I had to watch this movie with an open mind and except the fact that it is another remake of a great classic. Fortunately, this was a much different film then I anticipated. Although, the band music they picked for the movie was terrible the original score was very good which made for good atmosphere. The thing I really loved about this movie was it wasn't afraid to be brutal. There are many scenes starting half way through the movie that are completely shocking and ultra gory. Paris Hilton for one gets the best death scene in the whole movie, I should add. Also, the two killers in the movie are genuinely well developed and well acted. But over all, the regular characters in the movie are dry and stereotypical which leads to when they get it, it's all the more satisfying.A fun movie which is not afraid to take chances and doesn't skimp on the gore. 8/10 stars",House of Wax

134,Spaceygirl,Gory fun,8,4 January 2007,"One of the better slasher remakes of late. Much better than ""Chainsaw Massacre"" and better acting than ""Black Christmas"". With a gorgeous cast and witty script, ""House of Wax"" doesn't disappoint. The young good looking cast act well together, Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray headlining but no one really stretches their acting wings. The frights start early and the gore escalates but doesn't become too quease-inducing. The cinematography is effective and the special effects scarily realistic.

Everybody except Paris Hilton did a good job at acting (No offense but she didn't do anything). The story was pretty mediocre but it got better. The kills were actually exciting to watch and that pretty much sums it up. I was also surprised that the blood & gore level wasn't that high, I mean it had it's moments but it was pretty vivid. I was also stunned on how remake had a creepy tone.I think some people as well as the critics might not like this because it was made for a much newer generation. I mean I can see why. The original was 1953 and I have no idea why the remade the film so late. If I was the director wanting to remake the film (any film for that matter), I would have remade it in the 1980's.To be honest if I was a director in any way I would have left it alone but this is a good approach. 6.5/10 I deserves to be liked and watched.",House of Wax

A typical dumb teen road-trip slasher. A rehash of all the other movies previously seen in this genre.The acting was atrocious. And I don't mean Paris Hilton alone. They were all pretty s***.

Oh, did I just give away a crucial twist in the plot? Well, it doesn't really matter cause the plot is just a sidekick in this fright fest, where the gore reaches new heights that aren't afraid of doing anything to freak you out (even going as far as proving Paris Hilton has a brain in a classic brutal sequence).This no brainer ( *cough*inside joke*cough*) is about as good as popcorn horror B-movies get.

And it was......a pure hour of gore. Not so much from the story, which is very predictable, but more from the strange ""dark feelings"" of the small abandoned city and people living there.

143,Vampenguin,"Decent slasher, but very flawed",6,2 June 2006,"Though it doesn't even come close to the fantastic original, in all honesty this wasn't an awful film. Sure, it has flaws, but it's still fairly enjoyable.First off, I have to applaud the filmmakers for dropping Vincent Price's character. It was one of Price's best roles and it would have been a shame to see it slaughtered.I quite enjoyed the twist that they put on the original plot, the numerous nods it made to the original were, for the most part, subtle and well-done. The twists are all really obvious and nothing is very original, but it still makes for a decent enough story.The main downfalls of the film are the actors and the script. The cast is pure eye-candy for both sexes, including the talentless queen of eye-candy ""actresses"", Paris Hilton. The bad guys were sufficiently over-the-top, but really how hard could it be to play the kind of evil hillbilly that we've seen in half of the slasher movies since Texas Chainsaw? As for the script, we have a few gems like ""It is wax, like... literally"" and ""He looks like Elton John, only gayer"". Wow. I think those lines really speak for themselves as far as how well-written the script is.All in all, this is a decent modern day slasher that really doesn't deliver anything new. It has a decent plot, good effects and some fun deaths, but ultimately the poor acting, awful writing and lack of originality really bring it down. It's worth a watch though, I enjoyed it.6/10",House of Wax

This formula had already been done to death by the late 1980's, but the genre won't die. This one adds little new. It partly does recycle the storyline from a 1953 Vincent Price film.

For me a horror movie doesn't really have to have a smart plot to attract me. A successful horror movie need two factors to make me enjoy it: 1) original way of killing and 2) good scares. I wouldn't mind however if it had more to it. House of wax decently exhibit few horrors and has more than the minimum to make it a good horror movie.Two scenes I liked the most: 1) when vincent cuts wade's leg with the scissor and 2) when wade's eyes move under the wax mask. Truly brilliant two scenes.I was surprised to see people criticizing the director Jaume Collet-Serra. He's done good job, I watched the making of the movie and the man worked hard to get a clean job. The bed was covered with real wax and then they faced a problem when the lead character was running from one of the two brothers and her feet drowned in wax. So they put like pads on which she could step to run easier. The young director worked hard and he is not bad at all. He was good as well in directing ""Orphan"".I don't think people who criticized Paris Hilton were fair at all.

Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part. The town is creepy and I'm just gonna stop there. Because thats when the truly gruesome mayhem begins. trust me when I say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it.

148,jaxbubba,Wait for the Video,3,31 May 2005,"I love horror movies, the scarier the better; however, the most effective horror films are those which have plausible plots and reasonable premise. Neither of which are present in this 2005 re-make of the 1953 Vincent Price classic House of Wax, which possessed both.In this go around, six would be college students headed to a college football game encounter an eerie town and it's once time popular tourist attraction, the House of Wax (literally, the house and all its contents are made of wax). While en route to the game, our six unsuspecting collegians decide to stop and pitch camp in the woods off some deserted detour road in the middle of nowhere.The happy campers are visited by an ominous truck with its bright lights blaring in the middle of the night; however, the driver never revels himself and the truck departs before a ruckus breaks out so our merry band of revelers think nothing of the event. You can imagine their surprise when they awoke the following morning and found that one of their cars was rendered disabled while they slept. Anyways, the group splits up with two people remaining back to get the car fixed, and the other four continue onward to the game. However a series of unfortunate events place all six individuals back at Trudy's House of Wax before the night is through, and subsequently to most of their impending demise.The cast is headed by a slew of television's teen pop icons including: Elisha Cuthbert (""24""); Chad Michael Murray (""One Tree Hill""); and Paris Hilton (""The Simple Life""). However, none of them can save this highly unlikely slaughter-fest extravaganza. At least in the first film, Prof. Henry Jarrod (Price) was wronged by his partner and seriously disfigured prior to him turning into a raving lunatic. This film gives no inclination as to why Bo / Vincent had (unless you consider Siamese twins conjoined at the face, a reason); however, I did enjoy the final fire sequence of this new re-make though vastly unbelievable.http://farisreel.com",House of Wax
149,spacemonkey_fg,Cliché filled Slasher,4,3 June 2005,"Title: House of Wax (2005) Director: Jaume Collet Serra Cast: Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Paris Hilton, Jared Padalecki, Jon Abrahams, Brian Van Holt, Emma Lung, Damon Herriman, Brian Van Holt Review: OK, so I haven't seen Vincent Prices House of Wax and I know nothing about it, so I wont even compare this one to the original. I'm sure its infinitely better in more ways the one and I'm sure this one only took advantage of its premise and title and nothing more. So Ill just stick to reviewing this 2005 version without any comparisons to the classic.The story is about this group of young horny teenagers (were off to a good start huh?) on their way to some big important game when they suddenly stumble upon a mysterious looking town that is eerily empty and quiet. One of the kids has heard of the towns famous Wax Museum so they decide to wonder into it...There's a few things that didn't work for me on this one and a few that did. First off, lets start with the good stuff. The movie looks great. But thats a given nowadays, almost every movie coming out is glossy good looking to near perfection. The colors and the mood are well achieved thanks to the wonders of modern day technology. So from a visual stand point the film is great. Lots of yellows and browns. Lots of dark shadows and silhouettes.I also liked how the movie has a few good gory moments that took me by surprise. By now I'm used to movies pussying out on the gore. Specially the batch of PG-13 rated horror films being made recently. I've gotten so used to every horror movie coming out being PG-13 that when certain situations in House of Wax turned rather morbid and bloody, well, they took me by surprise and I liked that about. One particular moment involving fingers was awesome. So the movie had some balls and I liked that. And lets not forget the invaluable pleasure of watching Paris Hilton getting killed! I mean, the people in my theater actually giggled and clapped when it happened! But on the downside the movie falls trap to many a horror movie cliché. I mean, come on, crazy deranged Hillbillys? How many times are they going to come up with that one? Weve seen that type of character played out to death in so many other movies (Deliverance, Wrong Turn, Last House on the Left, TCM, The Hills Have Eyes) that here its not even scary anymore. And having the kids car break down...man that is the oldest trick in the movie making book! I'm not even going to try and make a list of movies in which this plot device has been used cause it would be too damn long. So the movie goes down a few points because of its many uses of horror movie clichés.The characters are paper thin, but in all honesty I wasn't expecting much character development in this type of movie, since we now most of the kids are going to bite it anyway. Most of the fun in this movie can be had with the way that the kids are killed then with ""getting to know them"".Once the kids get into the Wax Museum thats when the movie gets interesting. I love the whole Wax Museum set, with everything in the whole building made of wax...including the whole building itself! How the building manages not to melt away in the summer sun is beyond me, but who cares! The idea is cool! Specially when it lends itself for a waxy and visually interesting ending.Speaking of visually interesting images, that contraption they used to make the wax statues was cool looking and a whole lot better then just dipping someone in a vat of warm wax. Watching the process they came up with for making the wax statues in this one was cool.Anyhows, all in all what we have here is a moderate horror film. A bit to clicheish, but with a few good instances to make both you and your girlfriend/boyfriend say ""eeew"" quite a few times. Cheap fun. Hey I guess the folks at Dark Castle are learning a thing or two since this movie is better then all their previous films put together...not a difficult feat but hey, at least their trying. A few more years and maybe the folks at Dark Castle will give us a truly good horror film. As for now, were just having cheap fun here.Rating: 3 out of 5",House of Wax
150,TheMovieDoctorful,"Style Over Substance, But Still Weirdly Enjoyable",5,3 November 2018,"I miss the Dark Castle Entertainment remakes. While they had their flaws, there was just something about them that made them endlessly entertaining, watchable, memorable and interesting. They were a fascinating experiment in combining the classic, Gothic style of 50s & 60s William Castle Horror films and the more edgy, contemporary style of early 2000s culture. House of Wax demonstrates one of the messier examples of such a union and I can't quite in good conscience call it a good film. What I can call it, however, is an interesting and entertaining one.I can't talk about House of Wax and not mention that wonderful soundtrack. With some wonderfully atmospheric tracks from The Prodigy, Marilyn Manson, Disturbed, Joy Division and Deftones (Providing possibly my favorite song in their entire discography), the soundtrack remains one of my personal favorites and definitely helps give the film a very distinctive edge. In my opinion, it helps the film modernize a classic concept without ever feeling cheap and out of place.The cinematography is also quite impressive. The film has a very grimy, vintage quality to its look and does a great job capturing the vintage look of a village countryside. The color choice of harsh yellows and dark browns give the film a really oppressive and almost hostile atmosphere that is admittedly quite unsettling. If you have an appreciation for the visual importance of Horror filmmaking in setting mood and creating dread, you just may find merit in House of Wax '05. That unsettling quality is improved by the film's rather creative and haunting use of gore. Many of the kills in the film really stuck with me, I was genuinely shocked by just how far the grotesqueness went in this film. These are the kind of deaths you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy and really helped me to root for the characters, bland as they are, to make it out alive.It's impossible to talk about House of Wax '05 without mentioning Paris Hilton. Hilton was a pop culture punching bag upon the time of the film's release, and the film leaned heavily on the appeal to its more sadistic viewers of watching her violent death. So is Hilton really that bad in this movie?...No. Not really. Truth be told, I actually somewhat liked her acting performance here. It's not what I'd call ""good"", but she's a fun presence, reasonably likable and she's clearly in on the joke of the film mocking her public image. Honestly, she's probably one of the best performances in the film, though that's a bar low enough to trip on. This is almost a blessing and a curse, because by the time Hilton reaches her brutal demise a la pipe-through-the-skull, I don't feel satisfied or amused as a viewer very much. Part of this is due to the bizarre creative decision of making Hilton's character pregnant. If they were trying to make the character unsympathetic and have us cheer for her death, this seems counterproductive. Still, she was a surprisingly welcome addition to the film and I honestly would have liked to have seen more from her.If you had told me without prior knowledge that Paris Hilton would outact Jared Padalecki, a normally great actor who has more than shown his talents on Supernatural, I would call you a tosser. But, lo and behold, she does just that, as Padalecki is absolutely terrible in this film. Padalecki constantly seems to have his mouth open and eyes glazed over as he stiffly delivers his way through one of the worst performances I've ever seen from a proven actor. One has to wonder if keeping him silent for his death scene was an intentional choice given how atrocious his performance was. He's grown significantly as an actor since his House of Wax days, but this is definitely a career lowlight for him.Jon Abrahams is similarly quite awful as loose cannon comic relief Dalton Chapman. Basically, think Shelly from Friday the 13th Part III but infinitely more forced and without half of his energy or charisma. The film slows down to a halt whenever I have to suffer through his obnoxious and unfunny shenanigans. Maybe if the film had been hyping up his brutal death as opposed to Paris Hilton's, I may have enjoyed this movie even more.Another one of the film's biggest problems is its complete and total lack of originality. I can forgive a film that's highly derivative of others if it brings something new and fresh to the table; I've gone on record defending the likes of See No Evil and Avatar despite both being highly imitative of other works. The problem with House of Wax '05 is that it doesn't do anything particularly new or interesting to set itself a part. Its premise is a rather misshapen and incoherent mashup of Friday the 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the 1953 original with nothing to set itself apart creatively. I can imagine that a lot of people may look at a film like this, with very little in the way of narrative inventiveness, and find it rather pointless. As much as I enjoy it, it's hard to defend it as otherwise.House of Wax is very much a ""style over substance"" film and your tolerance for it is going to depend on just how much you're willing to give yourself over to that level of style. Ultimately, I was able to give into this junk food, bit I can still acknowledge its numerous failures from a filmmaking standpoint. Everyone has their guilty pleasures and you can count this among mine.",House of Wax

The acting was pretty good from everyone, though, dare i say it, Paris Hilton didn't really have to act much, she seemed to just be playing herself.

Elisha and Jared were great, Jon Abrahams was cool, Chad Michael Murray was his usual self, and hottie Robert Ri'chard was cool too.

152,Carrigon,This movie is why there is a cutting room floor,2,9 May 2005,"This movie was so incredibly boring. I was ready to walk out after the entire first half dragged on forever. Ninety percent of this movie should have ended up on the cutting room floor. There were very few kills, and yes, they were very nice. The waxing, the skin pealing. But they weren't worth sitting there staring at nothing for half the movie. The second half of the movie really wasn't written very well. And not enough use was made of the very kewl concept of having an entire town of people encased in wax. Actually, the entire script really sucked. And I hated the ending. Very neat, pat ending. Very predictable. This movie might have been good with proper editing.

153,Zombified_660,Love this movie despite repeat viewings.,8,28 December 2005,"Simply put, House of Wax is loads of fun. It's scary, inventive and exciting in all the right places, everything a horror movie should be. It reminds me of the kind of vibe the Jason films hit once they started to fool about a bit more. The movie never loses it's capacity to scare, but it has a lot of fun along the way.If you like slasher movies, especially the pre-Scream string of late 80s/early 90s movies like Pumpkinhead, Halloween 6 or Jason Takes Manhattan, then you'll dig this. House of Wax makes no pretensions to be anything more than a fun late-night slasher, and it's this concentration that makes it such a well-rounded package.However, this comes at a price. At nearly two hours House of Wax is about 30 minutes longer than most slashers. As a result it has a lot more depth than other movies of its ilk, and main characters Carly and Nick are much more three-dimensional than most horror protagonists, but the extra half-hour of character development at the start of the movie could and has been seen by many as a waste of half an hour. Still, I found that the couple of times I watched it I enjoyed the first half hour enough for it not to bother me much.It's a cool, cool movie, with a great main cast, a pair of mean, nasty villains and fantastic death scenes, and as such I think it's the best slasher this decade to come out of a major studio. Some may disagree and that's fair enough but I say watch it and enjoy.",House of Wax

I really don't want to see any more horror films and I don't understand what the attraction is in seeing lots of gore and blood and stuff.I adore Elisha Cuthbert (so cute) and don't even mind Paris Hilton, so I recorded this off the telly recently. But I miss the days when horror was implied rather than in yer face. Come back Vincent Price -- or even the Japanese horror oeuvre, which I liked for a while until it became jaded and predictable.I failed to make it to the end as I couldn't face any more blood after the first idiot was defaced after being waxed. Just too nasty and totally unnecessary.My main irritation was the way that the idiot brother of Elisha Cuthbert's character just wandered around places as if he had the right to go into anyone's property as if they wouldn't mind. He DESERVED to get waxed! I'd have heated the stuff up for the bad guy to do it! Hey - it's just a locked wax museum - it's just someone's garage.

156,KingM21,Dark Castle's best production so far.,6,2 September 2005,"To my surprise, House of Wax wasn't too bad at all. Not that it was great, mind you, but it was legitimately entertaining. The lack of CGI (or CGI blended in well enough not to be obvious) was refreshing, as was the lack of constant jump scares. The film was rather brutal for a big Hollywood production too, including a nasty finger removal on the heroine and a violent bat beating right to the head! You just don't see that kind of stuff in much horror nowadays. Anyway, the movie was a bit slow to start but once it did, it moved at a good pace and really kicked it up a notch with the last fifteen minutes. The actual house of wax, melting all over, turned out to be very cool. At any rate, this is a much better horror movie than such crap as Cursed and The Ring 2, as well as Dark Castle's best production, not that it had much competition.",House of Wax
157,InaneSwine,A great film (despite Hilton),7,3 January 2006,"This is less of a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price classic than yet another spin on the horror shocker 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', which viewers were subjected to in 1974. Having said that, this film is a great deal more affective than the 'Chainsaw Massacre'.The plot is negligible - a bunch of disposable youths are placed in the path of a deranged wax sculptor - but director Jaume Collet-Serra takes pains to build up atmosphere and suspense rather than relying on simple gore tactics.Most impressive is the mad artist's masterpiece: a morbid wax museum that is, quite literally, sculpted out of wax. With all that going for it, it's a shame that the film-makers still felt compelled to throw in the vacuous Paris Hilton, who is there for no reason other than to climb all over Robert Ri'chard in her red undies for some gratuitous T&A scenes.",House of Wax
158,MairegChernet,I didn't expect it to be this good.,6,10 March 2008,"when i watch movies with psychotic killers, i don't question why they are doing it. the same goes with house of wax which is about two psychotic brothers who are obsessed with killing strangers and sculpting their dead bodies with wax. i didn't question why they were doing it, i don't wanna know why they were doing it, i just loved the violence and the suspense in the movie.in house of wax, six strangers unknowingly get into a deserted and misleading town in which two psychotic brothers exist. when i heard the title i was expecting a low budget movie filled with crappy Paris hilton acting and little or no violence. but what i got was totally opposite. blood and violence every other minute brilliant acting especially by elisha cuthbert and chad michael murray, and thank god JC serra didn't give Paris hilton too much screen time.when i looked at the user ratings, the movie only has a 5.4 rating, but it definitely deserves better than that. compared to other expeditions gone bad movies this movie is definitely better. i gave it a 7 for the following reasons.1, it's very violent.2, it has many suspenseful moments3, elisha cuthbert is amazing to look at, both acting-wise and body-wise4, no Paris hilton making love with the wax.5, i am not sure, but i think this is an Asian movie adaptation, and if it is, it was the only one that was good.6, firm ending.7, awesome sculptures.P.S. can somebody please award elisha cuthbert with something, an emmy or a golden globe, anything useful, anything that will raise her reputation.",House of Wax
159,Boggman,Waxwork....,6,10 June 2005,"""House of Wax"" is a fairly amusing, completely far-fetched film that delivers to us one thing for sure: GORE. As a true horror movie fan, the film gets 3 stars on that basis alone.The movie really lacks any sort of story, and requires the audience to really suspend their belief in order to believe the films premise. A whole town, in the middle of nowhere (not even on the map) complete with mechanical wax figures designed to look like living townspeople, an actual house built of wax, 3 resident psychopaths; and nobody's aware of its existence at all?? Well, it's a tough pill to swallow.The leads (Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray) seem to do well with the dialogue & story they are given, which isn't much. However, reality aside, ""House Of Wax"" delivers with its killings, special effects, and graphic violence.For this reviewer, the price of admission was worth it just to see Paris Hilton receive a steel pipe through the head, in one of the films best death sequences. Fantastic! House of Wax has many borrowed clichés throughout its entirety. Nothing about this film could in any way, shape, or form could be construed as ""original"". Nor, would I really call it a remake of the classic Vincent Price film. It's more of a re-imagining to say the least. The wax figures displayed throughout the movie were also quite creepy, which was a plus +.Still, I enjoyed the ""House of Wax"" for what it is. A ""recycled"" teenage slasher movie with some good gory death sequences involving stupid young adults who ignore EVERY sign possible; and as a result, get wiped out one by one.Don't expect too much from this one.....but still, not a total disappointment either.",House of Wax
160,jeromesgabilo,CLASSIC,7,7 November 2021,"For me, this is one of the classic and good teen horror movies. The plot was safe and direct, but the score, acting and scares were on-point. Aside from that, it did not feel like it was being copied from another film.",House of Wax
161,jangu,Gruesome but predictable and sometimes truly boring,4,10 October 2005,"I viewed this on DVD and thus had the opportunity to skip to the best parts (but I didn't). But I think I can truly say that this is the best way to view this movie. Jump between the inventively gory highlights and some eerie imaginary touches plus the truly spectacular finale, and you will be saved about 40 minutes of pure boredom.Yes, this is the usual ""dead teenager""-movie except for the fact that these kids are in their twenties and, save for the plucky heroine, sometimes incredibly stupid. But this is something normal in these kind of movie, come to think of it. If you are threatened by an unseen pickup driver, smell a truly horrendous odor in the air and are surrounded by a threatening atmosphere, would you CAMP in a place like this? I guess most of us wouldn't, but these kids do. A couple of them also hitch a ride with a guy who seems to be some sort of offspring to the banjoing population we encountered in ""Deliverance"", also not the kind of action I would take.However, all things are not bad. The (straight) guys get so see Paris Hilton scampering around in red underwear before getting killed where it probably hurts her the least...;) The atmosphere in the small, seemingly deserted, town these post-teens wander into is also noteworthy. And the gore hounds get theirs in some nasty scenes. It is not that the kills themselves are particularly bloody, but they are executed in a very way so that you can really feel the agony some of these victims must be going thru. The first kill with the guy sprayed in wax is quite eerie and not easily forgotten.And like I mentioned before, the finale is indeed spectacular! Worth the price of admission itself.",House of Wax
162,dalton2,Very scary movie !!,8,30 July 2005,"This is a hardcore horror movie. There's gore here, there and everywhere. There are almost unidimensional characters... But I like it. Once you have seen the first gore scene, you're distressed for the whole rest of the time. The music is at times perfect for the scene, raising the anguish you feel to the top. I had a bad time while expecting and finally watching the gore scenes, but in the relaxing moments I felt better. Something like what you feel when you leave a roller-coaster. Ah, and the final scenes are pretty original. I recommend you not to miss it, but if you don't stand realistic and explicit gore, then you'd better avoid it.",House of Wax
163,ghoulieguru,Return to the Dork Castle,4,19 January 2006,"Dark Castle continues its assault on the horror genre with this little gem starring Paris Hilton. The plot line concerns a bunch of teenagers on their way to somewhere, who get waylaid in a strange little town where everything is made out of wax. A more apt title for this travesty would have been Town of Wax, but then they couldn't have claimed it was a remake of an old Vincent Price classic. As it is, this movie shares nothing with the original except for the name. This was clearly just a case of Dark Castle wanting to capitalize on the success of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, so they did their best to copy it note for note, substituting Elisha Cuthbert for Jessica Biel. I think Jessica and Elisha might be wearing the exact same tank top though.Just pathetic. Even when he was alive, I don't know if anyone would have called William Castle a genius, but he was well known for coming up with cheap gimmicks to promote his movies like skeletons dropping from the ceiling of the theater at a key moment. If William Castle could see how badly Dark Castle is tarnishing admittedly shlocky name, I think he might claw his way out of the grave and strangle the whole lot of them. Rather than taking William Castle's name and making poor remakes of his movies, Joel Silver and his happy band of idiots should have set their sites on Ed Wood. He was probably more their style. Then they could have called their company Dark Wood. You know, come to think of it, I better shut up. Knowing how these guys think, they might think that was a good idea. That's all we need, a remake of Plan 9 From Outer Space.",House of Wax
164,lovintennis,Too stupid and typical of a climax,4,8 August 2017,"My rating's a 3.5; I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Elisha's fall down the hill and face-first landing into the pit of dead bodies, followed by the bad guy's joke of unscrewing the fake hand off of one of them, was stupid. At the climax, the guy puts an arrow into the bad guy's chest and then the couple just leaves him there to keep looking for an escape plan. Is there bad guy dead? Of course not. They have a point-blank opportunity to do whatever they want to him to ensure his death but walk away, instead, under the assumption he's already dead. Then, the couple's rummaging through the house and gets startled by him suddenly stumbling through the front door and scurry for hiding places. They hide silently the whole time he STUMBLES (not WALKS) to the kitchen and painfully repairs himself. The guy has an arrow sticking out of both his CHEST and ARM for crying out loud and by his demeanor, he's obviously in quite a lot of pain (all busted up), in no shape or even MOOD to fight. I didn't think there was much reason to be scared of him; why wouldn't they just come on out and beat the snot out of him to finish him once and for all?? Especially since it's two on one?",House of Wax
165,walken_on_sunshine,House Of Wax:The Doc's Review,7,19 June 2006,"I bashed this film so much before it was released and only decided to watch it for cheap laughs but wow it's a very solid horror.I had thought the movie would be horrible seeing as Paris Hilton was the star but the funny thing is she's not the star.Paris is barely in the movie at all and when she is she surprisingly doesn't ruin it.The film is above slasher standards and is almost as enjoyable as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (remake and original.The film has many innovative and gruesome deaths and really uses the whole wax theme to there advantage.The film is held together by Elisha Cuthburt(24) and Chad Micheal Murray (One Tree Hill) who are amazingly great actors with bright futures ahead.The film has very good rustic look and has some really neat effects like the faces carved in the walls inside the actual house of wax.It is also enjoyable because it is fast paced and smart.It's smart because they know people like it when the teens aren't stupid and predictable and these teens actually pick up weapons and attempt to defend themselves instead of running into a forest and trapping themselves like in Friday The 13th.House Of Wax is definitely worth watching for horror fans,don't bash the film because of Paris Hilton get past that because it's a minor thing keeping you away from a spectacular horror movie.",House of Wax
166,cwrdlylyn,HOUSE OF WAX : Be Sure To Be Inebriated When Watching This...,2,15 January 2006,"HOUSE OF WAXI've had an honest interest in seeing HOUSE OF WAX since they released the poster art (which I still think is brilliant) and a solid trailer. They managed to make me think that it might just be possible that Paris Hilton's film debut might be in a decent slasher/horror film with genuine scares.Well, I was wrong... the film doesn't provide any real scares, Paris' acting is a joke (not to mention everyone else), and the storyline is plain ridiculous... but I was still entertained. The film actually seems to have decent potential in it's first 20 minutes or so. We meet the group of kids, including twins Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Micheal Murray, on their way to a football game. In the first few scenes at the campground and up until the point when the group of friends is separated I thought the movie had some potential. However, as soon as the group is separated it becomes blatant situation after situation and the acting just gets worse and worse. There's really little purpose in explaining the plot or describing the performances (all of them are awful... though a pathetic script doesn't help I'm sure). The only thing I can do is pick the moments in the film that make the film so bad it's funny...Hilton's ""pregnancy"" subplot. We are told for no particular reason that Paris' character may be pregnant, and she's struggling to tell her boyfriend. This plot point makes absolutely no difference to the plot. My guess... producers tried to convince Paris she would have some depth to her character by adding the pregnancy, and the dumb lush fell for it.At one point, Paris' boyfriend comes up to Micheal Murray and another guy peeing against a tree and asks ""You guys gonna have sex? Cuz I am!""... ummmm, okay... awkward and pointless. And laughably stupid.The final plot twist involving the brothers... that has no purpose except to make the film appear to be clever.The terrible CGI in the finale as the wax house melts down.The blatant attempts to get the young hormones racing at the multiplexes... 1.) Chad Micheal Murray, to help his sister out, takes off his tank top (with Abs conveniently flexed and oiled) to offer. Then proceeds to stand there on camera just long enough for girls to giggle and blush. 2.) Paris Hilton is about to ""make love"" (who am I kidding, she's about to get porked...) with her boyfriend, so she gets up and does a strip tease. Yeah, the stripping segment lasts longer than the boyfriend's death scene, and it's about the only moment where Paris' acting felt completely natural.There's so much more to laugh at in the film. The comedy never stops until the credits. It's the kind of movie I have too much pride to give a good grade to, but I also must admit that I'd watch it again... I'd just have to be drunk or stoned and laughing at it with friends.... D- ... (if sober and being honestly judgemental) ... A- ... (if stoned off my mind and in a Mystery Science Theatre mood)",House of Wax
167,henrymadman,Good Horror.,7,18 June 2007,"The best thing about House Of Wax is the man with the disfigured face and wears the wax mask, that Paris Hilton messes up, that looks like Michael Myers from HALLOWEEN. I also like the unexpected goryness of the deaths like when the man gets decapitated by 2 knives.I also like the wax model making of the man when he gets strapped into the thingymabob that looks like something from SAW.The ending is good when the building melts because its made of wax but that is a bit stupid and over-the-top because who would build something from wax.7/10",House of Wax
168,aeo,Movie sucks but Paris Hilton was not that bad...,1,11 May 2005,"I give this 1 star out of 10.I have to be honest. I cannot stand Paris. I met her at a premiere in Los Angeles, and she was a bitch, and this was before she became famous, however, her sister Nicky was really cool---so go figure.Therefore, I really wanted to hate this movie because of Paris but I hated it not because of Paris but that the movie, overall, just sucked.First of all, whenever a movie uses a flavor of the month or rappers in their movie, I know the movie is in deep trouble. We all know rappers cannot act except Will Smith and I don't remember any flavor of the month that acted well.That being said, Paris' acting was actually not that bad. Obviously, you can tell that her acting skills are not comparable to the other actors and actresses on the set but better than I expected. I would say her level of acting skill is about high school theater, if at that.The reason why I did not like this movie is that it used all kinds of horror movie cliché's and themes but executed it poorly. The story was OK but again, too sophomoric. The House of Wax had potential but it just could not deliver the goods. I found myself getting bored around middle of the movie and I was really glad that the movie theater had a cafe so that I could get my mind off of this bad movie.In conclusion, wait for it on DVD.",House of Wax
169,tyson-hunsaker,"A clichéd, yet compelling horror mess.",5,29 January 2017,"House of Wax had some solid things going for it from the beginning. The premise itself is already interesting and the idea of content a horror featuring a wax museum as the backdrop comes with intrigue for horror fans. It's interesting (and quite compelling) to watch and it makes some good use of frightening imagery related to its selling point: wax people. However, this film might leave audiences a little unsatisfying and generally disappointed overall. The movie is about a group of friends who run into car problems on their way to a college football game while camping out in the woods. When they encounter a stranger willing to help them, they stumble upon a strange little town with the building called ""House of Wax."" Upon arriving, they realize horrific things are lurking and the film unfolds like a game of survival and saving each other from the horrors of the town.To get it out of the way, the filmmakers make good use of some of this disturbing subject matter and present some quite horrific scenes and images. The film is indeed frightening at many parts and isn't afraid to make the viewer feel uneasy throughout the film. The movie understands its genre and takes advantage of it by presenting a solid scary movie that will ultimately make your stomach churn at parts. That being said, maybe the film understands the genre too well by not trying anything incredibly new. It wasn't as refreshing as expected since most of the ""jump scares"" and and horror clichés were predictable. Some of these were so obvious that it really can take the viewer out of the movie which can be frustrating to say the least. Performances are generally fine minus the exception for one or two of the members of the group that's presented. However, these are minor compared the very competent efforts of the leads stealing the spotlight. The film's biggest flaw rests with the script. Like mentioned before, characters do the classic ""horror things"" to do that make the audience pull their hair out. Plot holes are larger than appreciated and some of the dialogue that help create exposition for certain characters feel very forced and unnecessary. Taken all this into consideration, House of Wax does have some merit when it comes to its frightening and disturbing imagery. The film is effective in creeping the viewer out with several scenes and it eventually fulfills its purpose. It would've be fair to expect too much from this film but it can be a good time for those who appreciate the genre and are looking for an acceptable movie that won't disappoint all that much. Maintaining expectations for this one is essential or else audiences may be underwhelmed.",House of Wax
170,tyranid_slayer,Don't get me started with how bad Pairs Hiltons acting is!!,5,3 May 2007,"My friend gave me a borrow of this remake of the original house of wax.The final result was a decent film. But the bad points of the film were how teen it was. Like every horror movie nowadays has teens in it y'know like c'mon what ever happened to an older more mature group of actors. And this thing let the film down totally: 2 words Paris HILTON!!! she can't act she can't sing and the eternal question what is she famous for, who is she y'know. But all in all a decent horror movie a good idea ruined by Paris hilton and an all teen cast.Didn't love it didn't hate it only worth it to see Paris hilton die and because of the scene were Paris was sucking a black mans cock although you say you were putting on lip balm near his lap we could clearly see he was enjoyin himself",House of Wax

Everything in the movie is believable except the brother with Paris Hilton. Come on, she has no booty. Not even Tolkien can pull off that as a fantasy and make it believable. (and I'm a brother) But I digress. House of Wax has Elisabeth Cuthbert doing what she does best and that is run and be in peril (she did it so well in 24). Plus it lines up a lot of people doing the typical horror things they poked fun of in Scream. I was hoping that they would come up with something unusual, but it is clear that this movie was made fast and made for teenagers ONLY. With the high price of a movie ticket, I would suggest skipping this one all together and wait for it on Netflix. I would put this somewhere in the 200's in my rental cue. Bad movie, not scary, a couple of shocking scenes but its pretty much boring. I couldn't wait for it to end.",House of Wax

Well all but one or two, because someone must live to tell the story.This movie was Paris Hilton's big screen lead. She did a fairly decent job, but she just played herself. I would love to see her in another role where it she isn't playing a prissy girl.The MUST SEE in this movie is Paris Hilton's death scene. It is one of the better death scenes in a horror movie in years. Then it didn't hurt to see Paris die either.Well as you can tell by the title I was not a fan of this movie.

Now I'm trying to figure out why this movie was redone with such a god-awful cast, but then stop and think about it for a second: Vincent Price was in the original and we all know what that means right? It means it's an untouchable; Price is a a god among actors (the Johnny Depp of his day), and there isn't an actor in this movie that can actually act. Paris Hilton is probably the lowest point in this movie; just because she thinks she can make porn doesn't mean she can act. I've seen really bad B horror actors act better than her. The House of Wax story is a predictable one, you'll see yourself going ""der I saw that one coming."" The twists are as eye rolling as the acting. I must applaud the House of Wax itself however, it looked beautiful and acted better than everyone in the movie. The overall setting is unrealistic, especially the ending. There is no scary or creepiness factor here unless you're afraid of bad actors. If you're in the mood for a predictable joke movie this ones worth the $5.50 or less bin.",House of Wax

177,emdoub,Horror? I think not....,3,10 November 2005,"Okay - let's get the obvious out of the way first. Paris Hilton plays her usual character with here usual skill - nothing wonderful, but not awful, either.The good points - the movie contains a goodly number of ""oh, icky"" scenes, mostly well-crafted. There's a reasonable attempt at character development, and there's some pretty damn good acting, all in all. The special effects were all one could wish for.So, why wasn't it horror?For the same reason that it's not a great love story when two fetuses communicate telepathically in the obstetrician's waiting room - because the unreality of the whole thing gets in the way of the story.We've got 6 20-somethings, 4 of whom are remarkably annoying from the beginning. One of the non-annoying ones spends the next 45 minutes exploring ""clueless but well-intentioned"" territory, while one of the very annoying ones turns into a Good Guy in the final reel. They're driving into Louisana to watch a game (apparently college football) that they never discuss in terms other than ""really wanna see this"" - but if it were just characters that were unreal, I'd have been okay.We've got a car that won't start because the fan belt is busted - when it worked perfectly the night before. We've got a local yokel whose job is apparently is to pick up road kill, to dump into a pile at the bottom of a culvert - burying them or using quicklime is simply not an option. We have people melting wax to the boiling point (from the opening scene and throughout the film) over open flame, without it being a fire hazard. Okay - I've made candles, and the wax is an issue - someone re-writing or directing ""wax museum"" horror movies should know what it's like to work with wax.It is possible, I suppose, if you heat wax hot enough, to run it through myriad pipes and then through shower heads before it cools and solidifies - for the first time. After that, it'll be solid within those pipes and fixtures, and it won't matter how much you heat that boiler - the wax won't flow through the clogged fixtures. The wax heated, boiled, poured, or sprayed, in close conjunction with flame doesn't seem to be flammable, though many of the ""built of wax"" sets seem to be lit by candles. That so many parts are lit by burning candles, but nobody seems to realize that wax is flammable, is just one of the idiocies that make this movie hard to get lost in.The people who masquerade as wax sculptures are another impossibility - wax less than 1/2"" thick isn't exactly structurally sound, and you're not going to cover anyone with anything 1/2"" thick and have them look realistic. Rotting bodies aren't known for structural integrity.An amputated finger will drool blood, but it won't spurt - and the blood loss will be not much of an issue to the victim. A man shot in the chest with a crossbow bolt (very near to the heart) will be able to fight with others with no problem (try sticking a toothpick into your pectoral muscles, then move your arms - or throw a punch, without screaming or passing out from pain). A warehouse full of cars and dead cell phones will appear, in the dark, for a victim to hide - though it didn't seem to be there the day before, in broad daylight. A jagged end on a piece of pipe will be sharp enough to pierce a skull (front and back) when thrown, rather than knocking it aside - as few spears will do. A wax floor will become soft enough to let your feet melt into, without losing so much structural integrity as to stop holding the weight of you, your buddy, the Bad Guys, and loads of furniture. A wax floor will be strong enough to walk on when it's cool. Wax will be hot enough, when sprayed from a shower-head, to remain liquid when it hits it's target, some feet away. A woman with her lips sealed will be unable to make noise (try screaming with your lips shut, and see how loud you can get). It's tough to be horrified by something that's so unreal as to startle you. The acting is good, the ""ick"" factor is great, and the timing is certainly good enough - it's the constant violation of the laws of physical science that keeps the audience from becoming involved.At one point, a woman is frustrated because her boyfriend runs off to see to the boom-box just when she's trying to talk about something important. In the seconds in which he's gone from the tent, she dresses again, turns off the light, and lays down to sleep - as if any woman who has a topic to discuss is ever going to be dissuaded that easily. As I said, there are some good points - the acting is reasonable, and the ""icky"" parts are really icky. But don't expect to be frightened by this one any more than you'd be frightened by a tale of a table-knife that developed sentience and telekenesis and levitated its way through the throat of every President on Mount Rushmore - the unreality will keep you from becoming involved.",House of Wax

182,pookey56,house of whacks,2,2 November 2005,"this film is an undisguised attempt to appeal to a younger demographic of fourteen to 24 yr olds', and an insult to all of them. i refuse to believe that that age group is that vapid as to be entertained by this unnecessary ""remake"". early in the film one of the characters proclaims, ""i am surrounded by idiots"". this is the defining moment in the film, which goes steadily down from there. full of clichés, red-herring ""scares"" and unexplained events, the film is also full of characters who are not exactly brainiacs, a formula all too familiar in dumb horror movies. and that crappy ""it's so dark i cant see"" scenes stolen from Chainsaw Massacre but merely annoying, not building any tension, nor horror. it's difficult to film in the dark, and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a film that's suppose to have tension. but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case, the better. maybe he didn't want to wait until morning because he didn't care, other than it might cost him more money to do night scenes well, or he doesn't know how. who knows? unless you have never seen a horror film in your life, or you are two or three years old, every aspect of this film is predictable and done before. warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough said. all in all a blasé slasher film which begs the question, where the h*ll is the wax?it was treated like a lost leader. if you're bored as possible and all other rentals are out or you're just in the mood for a bad horror film, which isn't really scary,or you'd like to see Paris have a pole smash through her head, go ahead and take a chance. it's not the worst movie i've ever seen, but if this is what the producers of this film thinks a younger audience wants, i pray that they are deluded. a profit-driven film with no attempt to achieve any kind of art nor respect for the genre. you know, smart characters make for a scarier movie. i believe this is Collet-Serra's debut as a director, besides commercials and music videos. he has another one coming out in 2006 called Goal 2. hopefully his goal is to make a better film.",House of Wax

A story of two serial killer brothers who are the only alive in a town with evenryone else statutued in wax.The way people are transformed into statutes of wax is very cruel and terrifying. Especially you will feel goosebumps when you find the reality of statues and the life buried into wax.We started watching this movie as a random choice but turned out to be the real terror.Not suitable for younger kids due to some nude scences.,House of Wax

None of them could scare a child especially Chad Michael Murray and he's supposed to play the tough guy...C'MON!! The original at least had some balls. I only liked this because Elisha Cuthbert is hot and can actually hold her own and watching Paris Hilton take pole (through the head) is the greatest this ever filmed next to Beiber getting shot on CSI. The soundtrack isn't half bad either and the action is well paced. Certainly good for mild entertainment.,House of Wax

As a fan of horror movies i tend to keep the bar high. House of wax is a surprise because it's actually quite good. the plot is pretty simple: a group of twenty somethings are heading to a football game and take a detour and well, there you have it. So one by one they begin to die. Though there are obvious plot holes and script silliness but overall, once the movie found its stride (about 35-45 minutes into the movie) it really grabs a hold and doesn't let go. the characters are developed enough that you actually care about a few of them and the some of the scenes are just stomach twisting. overall, i was quite surprised it was a good movie. take a chance on this movie and i'm sure you will be surprised as i was.",House of Wax
186,Verona,Was an okay horror movie,6,9 December 2005,"I like to think of myself as a horror aficionado, so I feel competent to judge.I think it is disturbing that after skimming about 34+ pages of user comments, I only found 3 entries total which mention Wade's horrible death. If Paris Hilton hadn't been in this movie (death was OKAY- I wouldn't say spectacular)- would the others get a fair shake? I didn't care about her presence one way or another. Actually I felt a little better for her- evidently its better just to hurry up and get killed right away before the guy could get you ALIVE.Okay that being said: With Wade's scenes, actually trying to figure this out (which I know is dumb, its a movie!): wouldn't the wax have reached his eyeballs as well? And if not, wouldn't his eyes rot out eventually? Would Vincent (nice little homage to the original with Vincent Price) THEN replace them? Was anyone else cringing when Dalton KEPT peeling at his skin? If Wade was ""rescued"" what could really be done for him? The wax went through all layers of his skin evidently. Would they just put him in the burn unit and wait for his own body to regenerate its skin? I felt so bad for him (and knew it was really stupid for him to wander off into the creepy redneck rooms.I am not squeamish, but I absolutely HATE sadism or psychopathic apathy (I walked out of Devil's rejects) because that kind of serial killing is too realistic. Jason down at Crystal Lake is just ridiculous- and at least his victims die fast.So lets review, for Wade's sake: first he is attacked, has his Achilles cut so he cant run (very pet Sematary). Then gets some other wounds. Then is drugged, has all his hair (presumably everywhere) ripped out with burning hot wax. THEN has his whole body covered in boiling hot wax, unable to scream or move. THEN when HES STILL ALIVE- is positioned grotesquely at the piano there, his eyes still being able to see everything happening to him and his friend. THEN his friend tries to help him, peeling off his skin. THEN part of his face gets knocked off (still unable to move). THEN- finally gets to die- but burned alive. This is what made me physically sick in the movie. It really freaked me out. The whole cover in wax thing- fine (VERY different from the original)- but to have him STILL be alive after all that? That was just too much.As for the twin thing, okay- but why even show us the beginning with Beau and Vince as children? Obviously they were both the ""bad ones"". So what with the good twin/evil twin plot? Its very different from the original- the only similarity being that the wax figures were real people at one time. At least the Prof in the first one had the decency to kill them beforehand.",House of Wax

I had watched it when it first came out on DVD, but I didn't remember him being in it at all. I enjoy Supernatural, and remembered that I liked this movie, so I gave it another watch. There is something really creepy about wax museums, at least to me. I watched Waxwork when I was a teenager, and it was one of the horror movies that has really stuck with me. While that one had the displays come alive, House of Wax just has crazy people encasing people in wax. No, nothing disturbing about that at all.Even as a second watch, and knowing the premise of the movie, I still enjoyed it. I do remember when I saw it the first time I enjoyed the twist ¾ through the movie, and right at the end. How it ends did lend itself to a sequel, although it would have to be in a different museum. House of Wax includes all the goodies that one looks for in a slasher; lots of people getting killed in weird ways, gratuitous sex scenes, and a crazy psycho that slowly stalks his victims, but still manages to catch up to them. I also got a bit of a Psycho (the movie) vibe off of this one. I think with the quiet, creepiness of the town, and the woman who peeks out the window.",House of Wax

Don't expect heaps of intelligence to be nestled into these idiot characters' heads, and don't expect a story that makes any kind of sense, or that could actually happen in real life. DO expect some of that sweet, sweet blood and gore that we all know, love, and cherish. That's the only reason why we go to see this gruesome cheese, anyway.

It was worth the money. It all starts when a group of young adults are on their way to a football game. It was getting late so they decide to camp out. So thats what they do. Then the next morning a car has a broken fast belt (or whatever its called) So, Wade (Padeleki) and Carly (Cuthbert) go on a truck with a disturbing guy. He drops them off to a gas station and nobody is there. So they see a House of Wax and enter and thats when terror begins. The other half of the group stayed at their tent and one by one they get killed.I thought Paris Hilton did a good job. Some people would only go to see it just to see if Paris gets killed or not. But she did do a good job in my opinion. It was nice seeing her running around in red bra and panties. Can someone say ""Thats Hot?"". If your looking to see a horror/slasher movie with a group of young adults stranded in a dead town, House of Wax is the movie. The acting is average, but the violence was gory and it will get people disgusted. Some people probably won't like this but I did. 7.5/10",House of Wax

If you're scared a lot, then the film worked. House of Wax scared me a lot, so therefore, I must have liked it. Don't get me wrong. This film isn't anything special and by no means is it not without loads of clichés and problems and stupid teenagers. But it is scary, entertaining, gory, and fun.I barely remember the original Vincent Price film. I think I saw it when I was 5 or 6 years old on TV. This film has a group of teenagers, one of them being Paris Hilton, on their way to a football game and stops at roadside to camp for the night. The next day they realize that their car has been tampered with and naturally they do everything stupid to try and get it fixed including trusting every creep that tries to help them. They separate and end up in a town that looks like something out of a Twilight Zone episode which includes a house made out of wax. There is a legend behind this town that involves some wax sculptress and her freaky twin boys. Are they still lurking around? You just know that all our teens will find out.House of Wax has a real creepiness to it. The actors, which many of them are from The WB network and the other from Fox, seems to fit right into this genre. I like these kind of films if done well, and this one is done pretty well. I was scared a lot and if I'm watching a horror film, that's OK with me and therefore i'm recommending the movie despite all it's clichés you've probably seen 100 times before. (**1/2)",House of Wax

The movie starts of at a snails pace .....and then slackens, indeed in a 100 minute movie it's not until the 50 minute mark that we get the first on-screen murder.Things do then pick up a bit, but not much.We get a nice decapitation and Hilton get's a wooden stake through her head, though surely it would have still missed her brain by a good 6 inches!!

195,KillerCadugen,Mediocre,5,11 November 2005,"For anyone who loved the Vincent Price version of ""The House of Wax"" - or even the earlier 1933 Lionel Atwill version, ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" - this will be a disappointment because it is a remake in name only. It will also be a disappointment because the director spent the first 50 minutes of the movie attempting to ""flesh-out"" his characters with some mundane trip to a football game and then when the killing finally gets started, eliminates all but two of the characters in a very short period of time. The story itself is not bad - two sons of a former (insane) wax artist go insane themselves and basically create a town out of wax, filling it with people they have abducted and then coated in wax. The climax in the actual House of Wax is pretty cool, too. All in all, the movie gets off to a very slow start, heats up quickly, and finishes strong. It's generally kind of creepy (and gruesome in some spots), but overall is kind of weak. The twist at the end (which I won't reveal here) is not only unnecessary (unless the producers are keeping the door open for a sequel), but it provides little or no jolt. So what, is what I said to myself. Measured up against some of the garbage that has been released this year, ""The House of Wax"" deserves an Academy Award. But, to me, it is only mediocre.",House of Wax
196,Horror_Fan01,'Has Some Decent Scares And Thoroughly Gory Death Scenes.',9,25 February 2007,"""House of Wax"" has some decent scares and thoroughly gory death scenes. The wax people gimmick is used pretty resourcefully in a couple of scenes. And Cuthbert is good at screaming and looking vulnerable. The fact that ""House of Wax"" is comes off as decent doesn't say as much for the movie as it does for the sorry state of the overpopulated teen slasher flick genre.However, despite a slow and occasionally annoying first half, House of Wax suddenly explodes with gore and violence at around about the time that the first teen disappears. Sure enough, it isn't long before fingers are being cut off with bolt-cutters, mouths are being super glued together and Achilles tendons are being severed. There's also a terrific scene involving a cinema full of wax dummies watching Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? The film is so gory and violent that it's actually hard to understand how this escaped an 18 certificate. At any rate, House of Wax delivers nicely on the required level of shocks and screams and is definitely worth seeing for its stunning finale. Recommended.",House of Wax

You have your 80's slasher formula, with a nod to the old Vincent Price film rolled into one. One expecting great dialogue and meaning , look elsewhere. It always amazes me how people who seem to abhor slasher films insist on ripping movies like this to shreds in their reviews. If you appreciate a mindless kill flick reminiscent of the 1980's style, this is your film. Again if your looking for a ""Ring"" like psychological paranormal horror drama, look elsewhere.

It takes almost half the film for the putative villains to even show up, and one never feels any sense of actual threat from them. The body count was pre-ordained the moment these cardboard-stiff ""characters"" showed their oh-so-young-and-pretty mugs for the camera. Please...we saw better slasher flicks back in the 70's, late night on Cinemax. At least those rejects had the excuse of being low budget. Everyone associated with this movie ought to be embarrassed.

201,helencmm,My guilty pleasure,8,26 May 2020,"I understand why many people don't like this film, but that's my review, my own perspective and I can say that I liked it.""House of Wax"" is a film from my childhood. One of the first horror films I ever watched. Nostalgia strikes.This review will be mostly about the positive aspects. Just a warning.First of all, I have to say that it is said that this film is kind of a loose remake of the other remake of the same name, which released in 1953. In my opinion, no, it's not at all. Not even loose. They just took (kind of) half of the main concept and they said that it is a loose remake, just for not accuse them of plagiarism. This is what I believe. It's an almost completely different film.Then, let's say that I've watched this when I was younger and now I made a repeat and I liked it the same.Pros:* The plot was quite nice I might say. Creepy enough. Catchy. This film is a slasher, but not the typical slasher. It has many things that make it different.* Most of the characters were quite likeable and not that cliché, like in other slasher films. For example ""Friday the 13th"" (reboot).* So much gore. If you're a fan of gore and blood in slasher films, you're going to see plenty of those in good amount. And it looks so real.* This film uses mostly CGI effects, but in this case they made great use of those. In my opinion,
they looked very realistic. I've watched the ""behind the scenes footage"" and I liked how they all worked. I saw in their faces that they were very happy with the result and in general with all the progress.* The direction and the photography was just great. I really enjoyed watching it.Cons:* The plot is okay and creepy. Although I've found some over the top details. Like, who's accepting a ride of a completely creepy and pervy stranger? You're going to watch a match and we all see that the road is full of cars. How you manage to be just right back in time (In this case the slay time of course)? The petrol station man tells you to come to his place so he can give you the belt and you believe him? After seeing a completely weird and empty town? What an idiot... And of course, you see ""closed"" and you go inside? Okay... Why you hire Paris Hilton as an ""actress""? She can't act. Of course, the last question is rhetoric, since we all know why Hilton was cast. Money, success, marketing, but have a little respect to your creation.* Although I liked Elisha Cuthbert as a final girl and as an actress, her laughing was so bad and fake. I'm sorry, but it was annoying and not convincing.* I've found the relationship of the two siblings a little bit weird. It's not actually a con, but I was like ""uhm, okay, well..."" Fun fact, when I first watched this film and I was very young (like 12), I thought they were kind of dating, lol.In general, I really enjoyed watching this film and I've would watch it as many times I could. It's not boring at all and it is fast paced. Beautiful direction and photography, cool effects. What else do you want? I personally, recommend it. Especially if you're a horror (or particularly slasher) fan. I know it's not the best you'll ever watch, but it's okay to have a good time watching it.",House of Wax

This, however, is only an in-name remake -- unless you count the mad sculptor's name being ""Vincent"". In other words, other than the main concept, this film differs in terms of characters and supporting storyline.In this re-envisioning of the horror classic, there's a big group of college students who get stranded and eventually separated while on their way to see a college football game.

Six twenty-somethings out to attend a varsity game in Baton Rouge get sidetracked by a detour and find an uncharted small town that seems suspended in time, its centerpiece a wax museum that is actually built of wax  cue the usual dumb behaviour of twenty-something slasher fodder packs in horror movies, leading to their individual, painful and gory demise. Credit Collet-Serra and screen writing brothers Chad and Carey Hayes for attempting to inject some seriousness and character development into the project  there's an interesting approach to sibling dynamics and the film's exposition takes twice as longer than usual, to properly set the characters up  but, other than an engaging Cuthbert, a brooding Murray and a worthy villain turn from Van Holt, the casting is shallow and the inexistent talent of tabloid star Hilton hinders the film more than helps it.

When I saw the trailer for the film I was still not impressed, it was until I started watching Movie House on MTV, where I began to show interest in the movie. After seeing the film, I have to say that one should never judge a book by its cover. The story is actually pretty good, except for the fact that people go snooping around strangers houses... which I'm sorry would never happen. There were some scary parts in the film that made me jump. I think it had an awesome soundtrack, especially the show that played during the end credits. Elisha Cuthbert is one of the best up and coming actresses today, while she had little to work with on this film, I think she did the best she could. The same can be said for Paris Hilton, while she is far from a great actress, she did a good job with her character. I think she has potential to be better, if she picks movies that will show her range. Chad Michael Murray and Jared Padaleck also give good performances.

Pretty standard American Horror fare, but there was some imagination thrown into the script, and the fx were quite good.I see no reason why this flick can't rank up there with the Halloween, Friday XIII and Nightmare movies.

Why say no, when I'll be watching this film for free, right? Overall, I found the viewing to be quite pleasant, which is very surprising indeed. I had thought it would be a heavily CGI laden MTV schlock fest with a scene placed in every now and then of Paris Hilton prancing around in her underwear. To my shock, this film actually offers the viewer little to no CGI, cringe inducing surprises, and roughly 25 minutes (if that) of the ""famous for being famous"" heiress. Granted her last ""major"" scene WAS in fact of her prancing around in her underwear, but it lasted only about 30 seconds.

A few IMDb reviewers say that this film is a load of rubbish and that may be true but in my opinion this is a superior piece of rubbish. I don't know when i last had real scares in a movie but this one seemed to push all the right panic buttons. The scenes of gore actually did make me cringe and they included tops of fingers being chopped off and pointed stakes through peoples heads. I thought Elisha Cuthbert was extremely good and Paris Hilton,""for someone who cant act"",which i disagree with,did a very good job. All in all this film deserves 7/10.I would have given it a higher except that the twist in the tail could be seen a mile off. This is still a very enjoyable film and worth giving 90 minutes of your time too",House of Wax
209,Pigalina,Pretty good,6,12 January 2006,"NEWSFLASH! Paris Hilton not terrible at acting! Whilst on holiday we had in house movies, no, not those kind, (but with Paris on the bill you could be forgiven for thinking so) newish movies and so we decided to watch House of Wax when it was on. I fell asleep through a bit of it but the bits I saw were OK. (The movie is based on House of Wax from 1953, which starred Vincent Price who did the scary voice on Thriller by Michael Jackson - A little fact for you). Paris and some friends go off to watch a football game and it is a weeeee bit of a drive to get there so they decide to camp out for the night. They soon wish they hadn't! Their car breaks down and they wander into town but they all start dying in a variety of ways because two mad brothers who lives there turns real people into wax sculptures. Everything in the house/museum was also made of wax, as was the house itself. My husband wants it to be known that he thought it was lame when the killers who used to be conjoined twins, died, they died in the same position that they had originally been joined. (One had been joined by the face to the back of the other one's head so he wore a wax mask to cover his scar). Yes, that was a little lame I must agree. What I saw was your average teen horror movie, though no boob shots as I recall. I may have been napping.",House of Wax
210,axopnk,Good movie,7,12 December 2005,"This movie was a pretty good movie, it had a raw kind of gore to it like Texas chainsaw massacre, but just not as creative in the deaths as Texas. Still the whole wax concept was crazy especially with wade, (yeash sucks for that guy). Elisha cuthbert was good in this movie and Paris was, well... Paris. The male characters were pretty good, with the brother being the best with a lot of character depth. The other two guys (the black dude and camera guy) were alright, not much depth so you knew that they were going to die pretty quick. Wade was pretty much the strait edge pretty boy idiot who snoops around, (why Elisha cuthbert got with him, i have no clue) but you feel a strange satisfaction when he's dead (kinda like well you get what's coming to you). Some problems with this film is it's formula. It was pretty much structured from the start that it was going to be two killers, being twins (come on, Elisha and the brother playing good sibling bad sibling gave that away). The other thing (only being one luckily though) is the time table between Paris and the boyfreind. They went to the tent earlier in the day, but damn all the way till night without checking the cell phone? little unbelievable since they turned around. The other thing is the fact that the friends took off to go to the game at all just to turn around was kind of out of place, not that it's bad but it's just out of place(i'm guessing it's for more development of wade and Elisha). The other problem is the development of the killers, not much motivation for the killings, plus the older brother definitely should have died with a arrow to the upper region of the heart! (how he could still hit effectively with a arrow that was just in his arm earlier is beyond me). But still the movie was good because Elisha, the brother, the concept of wax and the setting gave it a very eerie feeling not at the same level of Texas chainsaw but pretty damn close. Overall it was still better than average, and is definitely in the good range.",House of Wax

Talk about gross, that movie capitalizes the ""G"" in Gross! My son & nieces thought it was corny in the beginning & I did also. They didn't react as most teens would have in certain situations but needless to say we hung in a few more minutes then the plot started to thicken. We were all glad it didn't take too long to get interesting but it turned out to be well worth watching at the end.

THE END. Thankfully it wasn't one of those movies. This film is horror fun. It contains supernatural horror, generally scary and shocking scenes and A LOT of gore! I actually found this film quite entertaining for my 9th birthday. Well, at least it stopped me from falling to sleep. The performances were a bit average, like Paris Hilton's ""trying to be scared and running"" scene, the plot however scored a few points but there is still some unsolved questions in the movie...

214,dimarinc,Well Executed Traditional Psychological Thriller,6,17 February 2012,"House of Wax was a movie that won't wow anyone but also won't let many down. The psychological thriller is a commodity when it comes to horror movies, but so many of the entries to this genre are frowned upon. The one miss in a thriller of this type is that there's no suspense of guessing who the killer is. However, as the story develops it does enough to satisfy as a story.This movie did some things well. It was very textbook in terms of acting, development and dialogue. Though it was an different story, it was unique more than interesting. It did however have the production value and the script of a successful modern day horror.The prolific deaths were a little lackluster once you get past the premise of the movie. Also, though the main acting was good, I think a little was lost in having Paris Hilton in this movie. She didn't do a bad job, yet didn't add to the movie much. They probably overpaid to have her and if anything certain viewers hatred of her may have driven them away from a legitimate movie.I would recommend this movie to any modern day horror fan. I doubt you will be let down, and if your expectations are low enough, then it may impress you.",House of Wax

Most people that bash this movie, i doubt even saw it. The one guy who said he saw the microphone on the set, i looked for it and didn't see it, but was engrossed in the movie so much, if it was there, i missed it. The first thing they did in this movie that was good, was kept Paris Hilton's lines to a minimum. Why they chose to have her dating a Black actor, is beyond me, i hate it when they do things like that in a movie to be politically correct, in Real life she would have dated the main characters boyfriend, besides then maybe the Black actor could have survived a horror movie, something that rarely happens unless your LL cool J. **minor spoiler** When the girl is under the gas station poking her fingers through and the killer bends down to tie his shoelace and clips off her fingers i was rolling, maybe I'm a little twisted but i thought that was hilarious and Original. A lot of the killings in this movie were. I would love to see a sequel! To all those reading these negative reviews, i Welcome you to go to the theater and see this, because if you go in there like i did, expecting the garbage most reviewers have promised you.

216,misterembryo,"Scary Movies 101 with Serra, Belden and Hayes",8,13 May 2005,"People in scary movies just don't get it. We have yet to see a scary movie where the characters don't look for the source of an eerie sound or a repugnant smell... where the characters don't hide in the places most convenient for the killer to find them. We have yet to see a movie that is true to reality where the true reaction of the character is to run and scream like a bitch at the first sight, sound, or smell of danger.Sadly, yes, the House of Wax is one of those typical scary movies... BUT WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING!!! You're not supposed to walk into a movie like this expecting it to be the next Gladiator or Pulp Fiction. You're not going to get an intricate Charlie Kaufman storyline like Adaptation or Eternal Sunshine. You're going to get killers, blood, sex, dead bodies, stupid characters with stupid hiding places.So when you walk into a movie like this, you instead ask the question What makes it different from everything else? Yes House of Wax has the killer, there will be blood and more, sex? in case your wondering, even though Paris is in it, nobody gets naked, although both Hilton and Cuthbert are equally sexy in this movie, you get a whole bunch of dead bodies, and a good share of stupid characters.So what makes House of Wax worth discussing? Because of what it has to offer compared to other movies of its nature. Of course you get your standard eerie town complete with eerie houses, but its the history behind the town that's the fun part. Of course everyone dies, but it's how everyone dies... There are definitely parts in the movie that Serra successfully manages to make you cringe. If you really want to go into it, the characters actually have personality, and Belden and Hayes touch on the relationships and histories of the characters. Including the history of the killer himself, offering a brand new addition to the slasher family. Not since Scream has there been a new slasher worth modeling your Halloween costume after.And finally its the resolution of the story that sets the House of Wax apart as the team of Serra, Belden, and Hayes work out a closing sequence unlike any other. On a plus note, they use ""Helena"" by Chemical Romance as the song to bring it home in the closing credits.You're not going to get an academy award nominee for Best Picture. You're going to get a new classic thriller that will be enjoyed for horror movie nighters for years to come.",House of Wax

She got the Siamese twins separated. After she went crazy, Bo and Vincent continued to work on wax, but the House Of Wax was no longer open to the public, but the twins still worked there. They made the wax sculptures out of real people. I find that disgusting. Then, two of six people stumble across the House of Wax in a small town. The door was unlocked, so they went in. What a stupid move. One of the twins in the basement in the House of Wax hears them. No one dies yet. That's the beginning, the part you did not really need to see.Some mentions of sexual stuff, five or six f words, and very creepy. I recommend 16 and up can watch this.",House of Wax

I know that kids today don't have the patience to watch the plot of a completely censored film unfold, but something has to be said for a movie that with limited violence, special effects and sex is legitimately good. And better than it's 21st century counterpartThe original film was what I would classify as a ""creature feature"" film. Probably because I watched it on channel 50 (back in the day) on a show called Creature Features. (Who else remembers that?) The new version is more of a ""teen slasher"" film. Teen slasher films have very compact plot lines. Almost cookie cutter. You can predict who will die in what order by the deeds they do. Clearly there is a madman in each movie turning people into wax figures. However, Vincent Price's sadistic Dr. Jerrod trumps the crazy Victor/Vincent twins any day. Although it was cute to name one of the twins Vincent. The original plot line was far more sympathetic as well. Even though he was insane, the woman he sought to enwax (what's the right word?) he was in love with. He wanted to immortalize her beauty. The new version didn't have that much heart. It pretty much limited itself to blood, gore and breasts.But! For the teen buck it had a lot to offer.

221,aleator,Not a remake at all.,5,2 June 2005,"Warner Brothers are simply cashing in on their rights to the original title of the 1953 classic. This version has nothing to do with the original 'House of Wax' (which in itself was a remake of the 1932 'Mystery of the Wax Museum'). Here we have a variation on what is basically a fairly standard teen slasher pic where the kids do all sorts of stupid things they know they shouldn't do and end up paying the price. There are some nice touches such as the house itself being made entirely of wax which makes for a good all-consuming fire at the end. But not enough has been made of the potential to exploit the theme of making waxworks out of living humans(this only happens to one of the kids, sadly NOT Paris Hilton).All that machinery and boiling cauldrons of wax is wasted as two of the party survive to battle it out with the forces of evil in all too predictable ending.

Instead it is meant to be a wide eyed twist which isn't really that much of a twist.I really did want to like this film and I was intrigued to see how well Paris Hilton would perform in front of the camera, but fully clothed for once. She did OK. Her role didn't stretch her. She was playing pouty and pretty. As I said not a stretch. Others who escape with some dignity are Cuthbert and Padalecki. But herein lies the problem, the production team, possibly for reasons of budget or lack of interest from elsewhere decided to cast the film with OK TV actors who tend to lack the sparkle that makes the transition to the big screen. To be honest, I cheered the bad guys in the end I had so little empathy with 'our heroes and heroines'.The relationship between the murderous brothers was laughable and the 'I bet you never realised who the true Vincent was' was similar to the third brother revelation - tiresome.Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis have their names attached to this. I can only assume that it is a production credit by way of cheque writing because if either had physical been involved in this mess they should hang their heads in deep shame.I've scored this film as a five mainly because I hate to rate below that mark as it makes me upset that I stayed to the end.

223,cujo2,Don't pay for this one..,3,30 May 2005,"I have seen countless slasher flicks. I started with the genre in the 80's and lived through all the ups and downs.. more of the latter unfortunately the past years. What struck me during these years was the irritation level of the canon fodder that usually consisted out of a handy bunch of young people..although young is a relative statement seeing this bunch but anyway.To care for any character in a movie it is advisable to at least give them a faint notion of likability so that the public can cheer if he or she narrowly escapes a killer or 2. But this first time director thought otherwise. He is presenting us with the least likable dumb ass group of ""teens""I saw in many years. From the very start you just don't care what happens to them at all. Which gives a neutral standpoint, however they are so blistering stupid in their actions that the ""Doh""factor becomes a running joke all by itself. The performance of Paris Hilton and the video camera joke becomes a statement all by itself and to be honest.. Paris isn't the worst of the pack to begin with. I actually suspect Paris to know exactly what she is doing and the fact that the trivia of this film state that the rest of the cast was ensembled around her seems to prove that.So that for our heroes..*cough* on the other side we have the killers..yeah there are 2 and the settings.The killers are nothing special either, no real background info is given ..no flesh on the bones so to say.. completely interchangeable deranged killer fare.So with all this to be.. a mild letdown there is only one thing left, the scenery. The set pieces, especially the house of wax.. which is exactly what is is very well done,and the non explored idea of the rest of the city is also very nicely done. For the gore hounds we have a clipped finger from our favorite * cough* 24 girl ( great hair extensions btw) and a well made erm... wax job.And that is it, like a bag of popcorn.. it seems to fill while eating it but after wards you get pimples and are still hungry for decent food.Skippable.",House of Wax

225,matrix29,Wax would not prevent rotting of the human bodies - DUMB CONCEPT,5,6 June 2006,"The human bodies, even if embalmed would still rot underneath the wax.Granted, the town's visitors (which are quickly killed and turned into fake sculptures themselves) would only be witness to the stink of the corpses. The flesh would swell and not be suitable for display even for a ghoul. The second problem is that in the American South, the hot sweltering summers would destroy all of the figures as real wax museums are climate-controlled to prevent the destruction of their sculptures. The other big problems are in that wax dries out, smooths out (from slightly melting then rehardening), and is vulnerable to moisture.Now, seeing the horror bits (1 hour into watching the movie so far), they use a sprayer chair to coat (and cook) the flesh of their victims. One would assume that any sort of competent serial-killer / fake-wax-sculptor would gut their victims so to prevent the insides of their corpse-victim-sculpture from rotting from the insides out as well as removing the eyes, brain, and other soft bits from rotting.There was another old horror movie (got it on a DVD with ""Little Shop of Horrors"" last Halloween) in which the failed-artist / serial-killer coats his victims with clay and displays his fake human sculptures, but the unfired clay dries and flakes off and a unrotting human finger is discovered (the movie wasn't realistic as the bodies displayed would rot badly under the clay in the few days that they were displayed). That doesn't even bring up the fact that the rot would *STINK*. How could people not notice the stink? Heck I had a refrigerator in the garage fail and the freezer was like a horror show of rotting food. There was a bag of breaded chicken nuggets swelled like it was going to give birth (the bag sloshed inside). I can only imagine how horrible a dead human being would smell compared to a defrosted fridge of rotting food. How people in a horror flick could be clueless to a stink like that would be simply insane.Horror movies should be gross and unpleasant, but not outright stupid and ignorant of the basic unpleasant truths of biological decomposition.",House of Wax

She is not seen so much in this movie, but when she does, then it is scenes that makes fun of her. Like a camera or the way she is killed. It is definitively worth a watch, only for seeing her die. Terrible thought, I know, but yet I have to admit nobody could have made her role better than herself. Her role was maybe written for herself, I don't know, but in fact it does not matter when her presence increases the interest of the movie.Otherwise, this is good stuff. It's a good horror with all receipts of what a good horror must have - a villain, disgust factor is very high, lots of blood, lots of killing and all simply a predictable movie as a good horror always must be! I enjoyed this movie, all simply.

It was a dramatic thriller about two deranged brothers living in a deserted town and are visited by a group of people in their late teens.The film also contained very disturbing, sick but amazing artwork of waxed bodies of real people. They looked very well kept until one them break and all the cockroaches come scuttling out.

232,knight_armour,Entertaining Enough,7,25 December 2006,"This movie wasn't as gory as I thought it would be. The build up was rather slow but that kind of worked in its favor somehow. Basically, a bunch of kids get ""lost in the woods"" and are lured into some ghost town where a couple of freaky brothers prey on them. Anyway, Paris Hilton was clearly miscast. She can't really act. Her little striptease (not all the way, don't worry) was pointless. Elisha Cuthbert on the other hand fit the role nicely. Unlike artsy horror films, our lead female here keeps her hard conical bra on under that all-too-familiar over-sized white T-shirt which makes us wonder why the director stripped her down a little in the first place? I suppose it's ""a little"" sexier. There was nothing sexy about this movie, however. At times it makes you wonder if there's some kind of incestuous chemistry between Carly (Cuthbert) and her brother, Nick. Aside from that, it is rather entertaining. Unfortunately, you won't really feel any sympathy for the ""good"" characters except those just mentioned. The antagonists behave rather predictably. One good thing is the recent trend in movies like this (e.g. See No Evil) that tries not to stereotype all the characters and actually has some of the good guys fighting back hard whenever possible. After all, the goons are just people too and when it comes down to it, it doesn't mean they'll win just because they are nuts.

Almost any scene will recall a movie that has already been done before - from Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Basket Case to Cabin Fever and a host of others. Some of this may be intentional as a homage, but when and where are we going to get original voices making original films, or at least films so startling that they make one sit up and take notice? Ones that don't have to ride on the coattails of previous movies? This movie's biggest problem is that it has as its main drawing point the presence of Paris Hilton. Although ""presence"" is too strong a word. She cannot act, so she stands in front of the camera and recites lines. The rest of the cast do pretty much the same, stumbling from scene to scene with nothing of real interest or significance happening. The characters are the usual cast of misfits, and seem as manufactured and unmoving as the waxworks in the titular House of Wax.Where they came from is not significant, where they are going - some nameless ""football game"" - equally so. Of course, they made the horror movie faux pas of looking for a shortcut and ended up in a ghost town with a dark and deadly secret. The film-makers also took some shortcuts in churning out a made-to-order piece of work. It does enough to escape bottom-of-the-barrel status, but only just. It's a movie that's so bad it's bad, not so-bad-it's-good. Even that might have been a small victory.",House of Wax
236,Sky_Flowersoul,Many creepy and intense scenes,7,8 December 2019,"A company of young people decided to relax by going to another city, but they could not get to it. They all fall into a mysterious town, where it looks unusual and somehow abandoned. The attraction is the wax museum. But not everything is as simple as it seems at first glance. The exhibits in that museum were once alive !! Will friends be able to escape from the clutches of crazy people? Watch in the movie!
What I liked about the film was its dynamism and realism. Actors played perfectly, I believed their every emotion and worried about them. There are certainly a lot of creepy and tense scenes, so it's not particularly impressive to watch this movie.
If you like the horror genre and films such as ""Scream"" and ""Turn Wrong"", then you will like this film.",House of Wax
237,Chandlergellar,This was the most disgusting Horror film i have seen in a long time!,8,7 October 2005,"The House of Wax, to my opinion was the goriest '15' rated movie i have ever seen. This is an '18' because this is scarier and gorier than Scream and thats an 18. The Story follows a group of teens going to a baseball game and they decide to set up camp. Than the next morning someone stole a piece of car equipment and so they have to go and get a spare. they walk into this strange town and things go down hill from there, than people start disappearing and than they find out the secret that ""everyone is wax"" meaning that they got kidnapped and turned into wax to be put into a museum (thats also made of wax). I wasn't that thrilled with the performances from these actors who are from teen movies such as Freaky Friday. Paris Hilton was OK, but i have seen better acting coming from Britney Spears in Crossroads. i did find it very scary and couldn't watch some of the death scenes, especially when Ms Hilton gets killed by a spear(YIKES). i give this an 8/10 because it was an OK horror flick, but i think that it should have been a 18 rating instead of an 15! Next time you enter a small town, thats deserted, just leave and don't hang about.",House of Wax
238,saywardstudio,a surprisingly good film,9,13 December 2005,"This was not a film that I had aspired to see, but saw it while browsing at the local video store. I thought what the hey and gave it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. Paris Hilton was pretty good,even though I thought hmm, how could this be good? They didn't over expose her although I thought the little strip tease thing, without leading to anything, was a bit un needed.It added nothing to the drama, really.Anyway, the film moves rather quickly, and I found, other than the strip tease, everything fit into place perfectly. I wasn't expecting the little twists and turns, which there were many. Some of the things I thought were going to develop into a predictable plot line did not. The creepy guy at the beginning that picks up the roadkill, I thought he was going to end up being a bigger, more sinister character, yet he fades into the background until the end of the film when everything is figured out. (He also leaves it open to a sequel.)The whole town being wax? Sh!t!! I wasn't expecting THAT!! I mean, I did not even snap to the funeral, everyone being wax! The preacher was looking annoyed,WAX!! The old woman opening and closing the curtain, giving hope that there was possibly SOMEONE real in the town, WAX!! I just would have never thought that! It's rare anymore that films are so twisty and unpredictable. Also, there was a fair amount for gore, super glueing lips shut(and pulling them apart!!) and cutting off a fingertip! That was super gross! The trifecta was the pole through Paris' head. That was great and she seemed to play being scared to death very real.This is a great film, definitely worth a watch.",House of Wax

I would say that the movie has more of a story line than expected, and doesn't rely on gore and shock to make it interesting, not that there isn't a good supply of gore and shock.Elisha Cuthbert is pretty good in the movie, and the movie *tries* to be more than just a slasher. It has a story, and some of the murders are quite chilling. I have to say that it killed a lazy afternoon for me, so I don't have all bad to say.I'm really only writing this to save some time for those of you who are just interested in seeing Paris Hilton in a movie. *MAJOR spoiler* Fast forward to about 3/4 into the movie and you get to see her killed in a pretty gruesome way.

The other only redeeming factor was seeing Paris Hilton die a gruesome death! There were actual applause in the theatre which just gave you that warm fuzzy feeling inside like there almost is justice in this world. Other that that, it was just another teen slasher film with no new unique twist. Some of the actors with the exception of Paris couldn't be blamed for the campiness. I was not scared at any single moment in this film, and I felt, at times, like I was watching a Halloween episode of Beverly Hills 90210 or Dawson's Creek with special guess star Bimbo Hilton.",House of Wax

The setup's the same, and you know when somebody's about to get killed, but I didn't end up hating the cast. Usually, horror movie victims, they deserve to die either for being too stupid or too unlikeable in the first place.These characters just showed up at the wrong place at the wrong time. I wanted them to live even though most of them don't make it. Elisha Cuthbert's performance was excellent, just as Jessica Biel was in the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Chad Michael Murray's role I liked as well. They both play ordinary characters dealing with a dire situation, but doing so in a credible, intelligent manner (e.g. they don't run around screaming for the duration of the money, only parts of it). The movie starts out slow but picks up the 2nd hour...there's a lot of moments with chilling, atmospheric intensity.and I have to say...I thought they ran out of ways to creatively kill people in this genre, but I saw a variation yesterday.

Elisha Cuthbert was wonderful, no surprise there, and Paris Hilton wasn't too bad either. The visuals are pretty incredible, and the storyline is very unsettling. I wouldn't say that House of Wax would go on anyones top horror films of all time, but it's better than some of the trash thats been released recently. So sit back and enjoy. House of Wax is surely one hell of a fun horror flick.",House of Wax
245,knows_film,This movie does what no other horror movie has done for 30 years.,10,9 February 2006,"This is better than The Execisit and should have been nominated for an Academy Award.It actually has engaging content. An unpredictable (within reason) plot. And antagonist(s) who actually seem like real characters for a change. Opposed to just being deranged and never part of the story except when its time to chase down another victim and kill them.I have to disagree with my esteemed colleague ROGER EBERT who takes delight in parodying this movie as the quintessential cliché. Suggestion to Ebert; give this film more credit for not actually being as pathetic as the rest. The rest are literally slash feasts where the filmmaker thinks all you want to see is sex and people die. Which is true but I enjoy the backdrop being an Academy Award worthy nomination of Best Picture. Like this masterpiece.The cast of characters of this film might actually have a lot of cliché tall tale warning signs. But unlike other movies where you know the character is endanger because they are just plain stupid and going in there is just a device to show us their death. This movie actually has you wondering what a character is going to see opposed to just criticizing their actions and predicting their fate.Whilst the movie did have a period where it became ""like every other"" slasher that thinks its necessary to knock off a few characters. This film took an admirably long time to even do it once and when it did it went about it in a respectively quick fashion as to just get it out of the way. Unlike in other similar films where the filmmakers actually think thats what you came to see and thus space it out over the entire course of the film. This film more or less spares you.I really liked this film because the Wax is just unique. The wax is a creepy element that the other dumb films don't have. This movie is worth watching just because the wax is creepy.I did not like this movie because the scantly clad suggestive Paris Hilton reenacts her recent internet fame. Not to mention the same costume design and choreography. Okay I did, thats the only reason I liked it. Is this why I gave the movie a 10? You bet!",House of Wax

247,RecceR,Slasher With Brains,10,1 October 2012,"Six college friends go on a road trip to a football game, but decide to camp out after taking a detour that set them back. After some car trouble, they find the town of Ambrose, which features a wax museum whose figures seem very life-like. The group soon discovers the town and people in it are not all they appear to be and must fight to survive.Many people mistake House of Wax for your average slasher flick remake. However, upon watching it, the movie might surprise you, as it did me. This movie definitely separates itself from most of the movies in the genre by giving something so rarely done in horror movies anymore; characters you care about and good writing. The writing is definitely above average compared to most slasher-horror movies of today. The characters come off as grounded in reality and relatable, some more than others, though. The acting is good and you may even be surprised by the level of Paris Hilton's acting; it's not quite as horrible as you'd imagine. If you don't want to see the movie solely because Paris Hilton's name is attached, then you are missing out. She is barely even in it and has very little dialogue. Another factor is that you have to pay attention because some things are very subtle. I remember I was still noticing things that were not so blatantly obvious after the third and fourth time viewing the movie. It is also not entirely fair for people to compare it to the 1953 Vincent Price version because aside from a few basic plot details and the name, it's a completely different movie. To be blunt, both are good movies that represented the best of its genre for the time it was made and are not anything of the same.Considering the fact that this film had a low-budget, it is of high quality between the set design and visual effects. As much as the gore in this movie is cringe-worthy (fingers, feet, boiling wax on skin), it is not over-done and is mainly prosthetics, another rarity in modern horror movies. Something that still fascinates me to this day is the fact that the entire town they filmed in was a set built just for the movie. The detail and style within that town alone is remarkable and gives a great tone to the movie — and who can forget the outstanding work that obviously went into the actual house of wax? The entire thing was literally made of wax. It has an old-world feel with abstract art that gives a creepy vibe, along with spider webs and dust. John Ottman also gave a pleasing score that sort of feels like a mixture of old horror with new. A very eerie tone was set throughout the movie with Ottman's unusual score. The song selection is also great with artists like Marilyn Manson, Joy Division, Deftones, My Chemicle Romance and Disturbed. One thing that may get missed about the underlying message of the movie is the bonds of twin siblings and how the relationships can be strained or forces one to stray from good. I don't want to give much away, but just look out for that and you will definitely see what I am talking about.If you are looking for a good slasher-horror that has a good storyline, then I highly recommend House of Wax.",House of Wax
248,Sam_Movie_Buff,It will surpass the original. But really it's nothing special.,6,13 February 2008,"The ""House Of Wax"" remake did indeed surpass the original. The overall story and atmosphere was captured better in this flick than the Vincent Price take. But it's really nothing to shout about. Even though It's semi-entertaining throughout, It's still one of those teen, cliché slasher horrors. Your typical run of the mill stalk and slash. While the idea never gets boring (if it's done right), ""House Of Wax"" manages to borrow every single cliché moment in modern horror. What horror movie doesn't these days? The story is very simple. 19/20 year olds are driving trying to get to a big football game. They stop and camp out in the woods - the terror begins. The only thing that makes this semi different to, lets say ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, ""Wrong Turn"" etc.., is the Wax storyline. Which was so/so interesting. The House Of Wax itself was surprisingly well done. I do give them props for that. However, the overall story surrounding the picture was beyond mediocre. Why do these horror filmmakers always have to have the ""deformed"" storyline. Seriously. We have it in every damn horror movie. The boy was disfigured, he hid out in his room, his parents neglected him, yada, yada, yada - you see where I'm going with this. Can they never come up with anything new. Maybe he was a woman first, no? Anything but that damn disfigured story.The course of the movie runs pretty well. I mean, I never nodded off to sleep. But there were some moments that were just too predictable. So usual horrorish. The newer horror movies should have more story, more surprises up their sleeve. Unfourtunetly ""House Of Wax"" could be any late 80's horror movie - minus the bad effects. One thing I will say is, the acting was pretty damn good. I mean, most of the ""teens"" could act. Elisha Cuthbert and Jared Padalecki were the highlights of this movie for me (on the acting aspect). Elisha has a great versatile approach about her. She can go from the typical blonde cute girl, to a more stripped down character with depth. In her scared, tense, scenes, she was really believable. Jared is just an all round great, talented actor. If you're a fan of his TV show ""Supernatural"" (amazing show) you will already be aware of his acting chops. His acting is just so unique - like he's not even acting. It's like he is this character.Jared (IMO) should have been the leading male. Instead they gave it to One Tree Hill actor Chad Michael Murray - who played the role of the ""bad boy"" well. Towards the end of the movie he showed a different side to his brooding, bad boy character. It showed he had depth. Good character development. Then we get to the Oscar winning actress that is Paris Hilton. You know what, I'm not even gonna lie. I feel Paris did okay in the movie. Her performance wasn't catastrophically bad. I mean ,she was just the dumb blonde - so she was basically playing herself. Props to her for her big ""death scene"" though. She did a good job.THE END: Well, it was a tad far fetched. You expect us to believe the whole house was made of pure wax. Come on? SCRIPT ERROR. Though the fact the whole house was made of wax is fairly stupid - the visual aspect of the ending was amazingly done. Big highlight of the movie.All in all ""House Of Wax"" is a successful American horror remake. It did what it was supposed to do - entertain for an hour and a half. It's an above average slasher flick. Even though it has some plot holes and minor script flaws, I would still recommend it.",House of Wax

I felt embarrassed when I left the theater,and I'm afraid that people will laugh at me when I tell them that I saw this dribble. This movie goes to show you that it is a really bad idea to remake ANYTHING that Vincent Price once did. My philosophy is to never remake anything done originally by Vincent Price, Christopher Lee or Lon Chaney. They are the masters and their works can NEVER be replaced, ever. **This might be a spoiler** Who has the bright idea to make a movie with a house made of wax in the south?

251,curtman2,Chilling Wax,7,15 May 2005,"""House of Wax"" traffics plentifully in clichéd, campy territory, with Paris Hilton surprisingly enough sub par to the events at hand, yet isn't mired too much in wax to be dismissed as ""another hysterical, implausible"" teen horror flick. It has elements of sophomoric hilarity, specifically the awfully lax acting, not confined to wax sculpture Paris Hilton, but virtually the entire cast, as they run around fussing and screaming, and as is the accustom for these kinds of flicks, inexplicably find themselves seeking their own grisly fates with every ludicrous misstep they take. That said, ""Wax"" is also exceedingly creepy and horrific in many parts, and the sheer grotesque images of human flesh-manufactured wax sculptures as well as the excruciating process of ""wax manufacturing"" evokes tingling chills down your spine that is hardly gratifying, yet these elements are sufficiently scary enough for a worthy ""shriek"". There's not much to be made of the premise, which consists of several doting ""teenagers"" (most of whom are in their mid-20s, by logic) taking a wrong turn on a swamplands road trip and detouring to a terrifying town of their grisly fates- where afflicted, despondent brothers perpetrate gruesome killings and mold their victims' flesh into wax sculptures to boast their literally human, ""community of wax"". Not to be ignoble, but the ""players of death"", or the characters who stumble upon the hell of ""house of wax"", destitute of even the slightest thread of common sense, are almost worthy of their gruesome fates, and Paris Hilton's function and purpose in herself is for the audience to root and eventually cheer for her not-so-heiress demise. The editing work is surprisingly effective here, moreso as the film etches along, and much of the graphic material is actually jolting and unforeseeable, with the shots being exceptionally well orchestrated and encompassing of every action. Surely enough, ""Wax""'s respect in the originality department is destitute, as its entire premise has been recycled and burned into wax many times over, almost mimicking exactly ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Yet despite its campy nature, clichéd material, and inept acting, there's enough to be said of ""House of Wax"" for delivering its fair share of spine-tingling terror and jaw-dropping carnage that makes for a fairly effective horror with some truly horrific elements. Don't take it too seriously, ignore Paris Hilton's minimal annoyances, and stay jolted to your seat with awe at the freakish horror of the scorching, oozing process of wax as it makes wonders out of mortifying human flesh. Sounds creepy? ""Wax"" transcends the ""teen slasher"" genre and actually looms some chilling, gory horror. *** out of ****",House of Wax
252,urbanlegend23,That's hot.,10,23 July 2005,"""House of Wax"" (2005) Dir. Jaume Collet-Serra It's become something of a cliché with film critics or movie reviewers to begin their reviews of ""House of Wax"" by confirming whether or not Paris Hilton can act. Obviously most of the reviews will have extremely negative comments about Hilton's performance, but I really don't think she was as dreadful as you might expect. Perhaps Hilton might not have really wanted to be an actress by ambition or gained her part in this movie through hard audition and practice routines, the way she is indicates she probably woke up one morning with a hangover and decided she might go out and begin acting today.However, her performance really isn't that bad. Maybe this is just me being biased since I do enjoy ""The Simple Life"", I find Hilton extremely attractive, and enjoy seeing what she's up to in every other magazine, but I do also think she does reasonably well with a small part. Her chase scene and showdown with the killer particularly is one of the film's best sequences, and since Hilton doesn't really have that much to do in the movie (and what she does have to do she does adequately, sometimes even charmingly - I enjoyed the ""yes, let's follow the smell...why?"" scene with Elisha Cuthbert), critics who rant that she gives the year's worst female performance are completely unfair, they are most probably simply hating Paris in the movie because she's Paris.Now that we've passed that fiasco, the film overall was an enjoyable night out - it had everything you look for in this genre and left me feeling satisfied and entertained throughout.Personally I didn't find the movie very scary, but it did have some very good boo frights (the mirror one especially), and the wax people were genuinely creepy. The film manages to maintain a great atmosphere, there's a constant chill in the wind in this deserted and rundown town, you can tell something's wrong the moment they set foot in the town (if it's not already obvious from trailers or reading what the film's about).I noticed to my great surprise that the filmmakers attempted to develop these characters, which leads to it being dragged out a little too long. While I did respect this decision to try and add some meat to the bones of the six teenagers, it never really works as naturally as it did in 2003's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", such a brilliant success that year that it now seems like the slasher movie to beat. Most of the character/non-waxy material in ""Wax"" just feels unnecessary in the long run, the only character who benefits from this period of 'development' is Chad Michael Murray, awkwardly unlikeable and harsh at the start, he becomes more sympathetic and likable after we hear a little about his life and begin to come to terms with why this guy is the way he is. I was expecting to hate the overexposed Murray in this film but he ended up being one of my favourite characters in the movie.""Wax""'s deaths and scares may not come as fast as you may expect, but they are definitely worth waiting around for. This film, unlike so many of the slashers being released lately, doesn't hold back on the gore and doesn't let the gorgeous celebrities (even those who survive) to go out gracefully.I have another complaint that I see other reviewers and movie fans have had with this most-enjoyable film: Paris Hilton, nor any of the other characters in the film, never touch wax and say ""that's hot"". A pet peeve, but it's something I was looking for. Never mind though - ""House of Wax"" is a lot of fun and will immediately fall into the good graces of horror fans. Enjoy! 7/10",House of Wax

When I found out a remake was on the way, I groaned. WHY OH WHY remake a good film? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for buggering yet another classic horror film. This time they've replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore, slower than slow pacing, and yawn-inspired characters. Someone previously said that s/he was surprised that Paris Hilton can act. Uh, were you watching the film? She plays a prissy little tramp. Sounds like typecasting to me. Half of the people in the audience actually CHEERED when she died! That tells you why people are seeing this film. If that's your only reason, then find a better one, because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than you'll want.

I had read reviews from here and various magazines and papers that it was good but not good enough. I think people had their own grievances about a certain Ms Hilton.I like Chad Micheal Murray. He stands out in this film because he's not playing the sweet prince charming. Jared Paladeki for me is so good. He's a great actor and I am a big fan. I think everyone loves Elisa Cuthbert after The Girl next Door but this girl is a fab actress and definitely one to watch. Paris Hilton was not that bad. I think she done what she could with Paige. Thought it was rather amusing that she was in her underwear and Dalton had the video cam. Entertaining for a few moments anyway.This film has so much gore it is unbelievable. It was brilliant in the sense that it wasn't over the top and it was completely believable. The end where the house is on fire is amazing.

257,horsecrazy6791,"Almost exactly like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but still really good!",9,4 November 2005,"I don't know about other people, but while I watched this movie, all I could think about was how much it was like the 2003 remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" They both start out with a group of teens, and finish with one, or in this case, two survivors who are scarred for life after witnessing their friends murders. In The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, everyone in the town is somehow connected to the chainsaw killer that lurks inside the big house. And in this movie, it's pretty much the same. The sick, old roadkill man is Vincent and Bo's brother, who leads them into the trap. Bo is the one who lied to his brother, Vincent, and told him their mother would have wanted him to kill. All of them are tied together somehow. But...maybe the fact that this movie seems EXACTLY like The Texas Chiansaw Massacre is just a coincidence...or maybe it's just me...but I doubt it.But aside from all that, it was probably the best horror movie I have seen in a long time, even if it's very similar to another horror film. I thought all the actors/actresses did a really good job...even Paris...the one who got famous for doing nothing. She wasn't in as much of the movie as most of the others, but I thought she played her character pretty well. The best performance though, I'd say, was by Elisha Cuthbert. If it weren't for her, the movie just wouldn't be the same. She did such a good job, and made her character seem so real and believable.If you really look at them, the wax people, are pretty freaky looking, especially since they are supposed to be real, dead humans, tortured and turned to wax by Vincent, the killer who lurks around the abandoned town preying on lost, unaware visitors who happen to stumble upon it. I think the one that looks the sickest, and the most disturbing is the old woman that supposely pulled back the curtains when Carly(Elisha Cuthbert) was screaming for help. Even though she was wax, her eyes seemed to be staring right at Nick when he looked in the window.At one point in the movie, when Wade goes into Bo's house to use the washroom, he comes out afterwards, and starts looking around at Bo's stuff. Eventually he wanders into another room...and begins looking around in there too. There is a table, and on top of it, a bunch of odd metal tools, knives and scissors. He picks one up....and then the lights go out. Wade tried to open the door but it was locked from the outside. Then, out of a trap door in the middle of the floor, Vincent entered the room. He cut the back of Wade's leg with a pair of long, metal scissors, and stabbed him in the arm. Soon after, Wade was strapped to a chair and tortured some more. Vincent stitched up Wade's stab wounds, and covered his entire body with wax...By then, I felt so bad for Wade, because he was my favorite out of the four. (In the movie, not real life.) But it was really sad when Dalton found him...covered in dried wax...unable to speak or move, except for shifting his eyes back and forth.) Then tying to help him, Dalton starts to peel the wax off, revealing the blood and muscle in Wade's face. It was pretty obvious at that point that Wade couldn't be saved. Of course, seconds later, Vincent shows up, and kills Dalton by slicing his head off with two knives.So yeah, I guess the death scenes in the movie were really well done. It was kind of funny to see Paris Hilton die, but in the movie it was pretty gross to see a pole get impaled through someone head... Paris's boyfriend wasn't in too much of the movie, and his death wasn't exactly shown, except for him lying on the ground, half alive, with a knife in his throat. I really felt bad for Carly too, when she had her finger cut off. That would hurt so much! One thing that was kind of funny was when they were hiding in the old movie theater, and that OLD black-and-white film was playing. The lady singing was pretty hilarious! ""I've written a letter to Daddy!"" Ha ha...and it was still playing while Bo was searching Nick and Carly, who were hiding in the theater.Well I guess overall I can say that ""House of Wax"" was a really good movie! One of the best horror movies I've ever seen! If you haven't seen it in theaters, and are looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, go out and rent or buy this one! I can almost guarantee you will love it! 9/10",House of Wax
258,jmille42,"Maybe it is best for Paris to stay in the ""green light.""",3,14 July 2005,"Elisha Cuthbert (Television's 24) stars in this violent remake of Vincent Price's 1953 cult classic. In this version, six friends embark on a quiet town where they discover a Wax Museum (and gas prices around $1.20 a gallon..WHAT A DEAL!!!). The slicing and dicing begins as the young teens must fight to survive the wrath of two demented brothers, who enjoy waxing people alive.Nothing like seeing a bunch of dumb teenagers stumble onto a violent adventure, leaving most dead and of course one or two alive. There is nothing too spectacular to report on this film, except a striptease from Paris Hilton (Hey, if she absolutely has to be in this movie, might as well have her doing what she does best, because it certainly is not acting). The rest of the cast, with the exception of Cuthbert, act as if they were brought off the set of their Nickelodeon sitcoms to work on this cheesy mess.As it was for my buddies and I, this is a good chance to watch the ever so lovely Elisha Cuthbert. Best known to the television world as Kimberly Bauer, she is heading in the right direction to be the next leading lady in Hollywood. What a relief for her that she won't have to share anymore screen time with the awful Paris Hilton and the rest of these so called actors. Maybe it is best for Paris to stay in the ""green light.""",House of Wax
259,Weisz_Man,AN Above Average Slasher,8,20 November 2006,"This new version of ""House Of Wax"" bears very little resemblance to the original, released over fifty years ago. That right there means certain people are gonna be angry about it. And I'm sure it must pain fans of the original to see this updated version with Paris Hilton as one of the stars. Nevertheless, if you are just looking for a good, fun slasher, with a hard R-rating (believe me, this puppy earned it), you could do much worse. Forget that this is a remake, and you will probably find yourself being pleasantly surprised. And if you still aren't sold, look at it this way: You get to watch Paris Hilton die! ""House Of Wax,"" which stars Chad Michael Murray (from WB's...well, just the WB I guess) and Elisha Cuthbert (who is way sexier than Hilton, without even trying) tells the familiar story of a group of twenty somethings, on their way to a football game, who pull over for the night to set up camp and get a little R & R. However, an automobile problem, a broken headlight, and some damn stinky squirrels and deer, cause this group to wander into a town that time seems to have forgotten. The town, however, has one interesting feature, and that is the infamous House Of Wax. Not only is everything inside made out of wax (or is it?), the House itself is Of Wax. Of course, things go horribly wrong. Why does it feel like the wax figures can see us? Who was that outside the window? Why does that guy keep flirting and leering at my girlfriend? The movie plays out much like classic slashers such as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and even more like the 2003 ""T.C.M."" remake. Not only are both remakes extremely pumped up from the original, but you will notice many parallels between the two, from the bizarre torture scenes, to the creepy towns people, all the bases are covered with this movie. If you are a genre fan, you can't help but enjoy this movie. It does try a few different things and will take you by surprise a few times. Heck, one major surprise is Paris Hilton playing someone with moderate intellect. When someone says ""What's that smell?"" she doesn't want to find out. When she is being chased by the antagonist, she finds a weapon, and uses it. Not just your average teen slasher/splatter flick. As far as the gore goes, this movie has an abundance of it, but I found the wax much more effective. On a list of worst ways to die, I'd put that at the top! And when will people realize, if you keep picking at it, it won't heal (watch it and find out)? If it's possible to have a fear of wax, this movie may put it in you.So try not to let the seemingly shallow nature of this movie turn you away. Afterall, it's actually quite good, and it's refreshing, in a world of nuetered ""PG-13"" ""horror"" flicks, that a nice, solid ""R"" comes along and gives us the flanking we so badly needed. It's got it's flaws, and it does take a while for the film to build momentum, but if you want thrills, this one's got it. Just try not to cheer or laugh too much when Paris has her big moment...",House of Wax
260,gaeanprayer,"WTF, this was actually decent!",6,4 July 2006,"Because it's usually what most people want to know about, I'll get it out of the way right now; Paris Hilton dies a horrible death, and it's exciting, because she does it well. Yep, I'll admit it; for her first film she did a good job. No grammy, but she did a better job than some of the other cast members in making her death and the events that lead to it believable and fun. She runs, she fights back, and her character was supposedly **Major Spoiler** pregnant, so when she dies it's even more of a shame.That said, Paris is annoying in her indifference and pompous attitude...There, conscience cleared.Anyway, this movie received a lot of crap but I found it enjoyable. In fact, part of the reason I liked it so much is probably because I was expecting so little. I honestly just wanted to watch people die, but a couple of the victims' deaths were surprisingly upsetting to me. Especially Dalton, who grew on me in an odd, annoying way I cannot explain. Like fungus.Unfortunately, this movie wasn't all great; everything was predictable. From the beginning I predicted who would live and die and in what order. Imagine that, I got it right! I managed to figure out the ending before the bad guys were even dead, which is really bad considering the ending is supposed to surprise. I also found the main character, Carly, just plain annoying. I can't explain why, so maybe it wasn't the fault of the actress, but I still desperately wanted her to die. Oh well.In any case, the movie was fun and enjoyable, not to mention plenty gory, even if some of the gore didn't make a large amount of sense, i.e., Wade being encased in wax yet his eyes suffered no dry ickyness because of being unable to blink. It's the little things you notice...Would I have paid to watch this in the theatre? Probably not, but as a rental I didn't regret my decision.",House of Wax
261,Nephalim,Maybe this is how it was supposed to be?,3,7 May 2005,"This movie is about Paris Hilton dying. It pretends to be about teenagers getting sucked into a teen horror flick and not seeming to know it - why else would they bumble around like idiots waiting for psychos to slash them?Since the moment Paris Hilton was announced as on the cast of this film, that's all that this film has been about. It makes me think that the director made this film specifically to see fantasies about Hilton's gruesome death come to fruition. What conversation about House of Wax hasn't involved Paris Hilton? What interview or featurette hasn't brought her up?It's amazing to see this in theatres. Everyone is anxiously waiting for Paris Hilton's death. They plod through the scenes involving other people, and elbow each other expectantly in Paris-heavy scenes. ""This is it. This is when she gets it."" And when finally she does get a stake through the head, everyone stops paying attention. It's not scary, the acting's deplorable, and the script is worthless, but none of that matters, because all anyone came to see what Paris Hilton getting a spike through the head. However, the more macabre among us movie-goers will be disappointed. A spike through the head is the best we came up with? If I was personally behind this project, I would've put Sin City to shame with the torturous end I'd put Paris Hilton through. Blood, bones, teeth, and various Paris organs would've made appearances (and not the ones showcased in her previous films). It would've been long, and it would've been mean.This movie fails on all scales: As a movie in general, it's poorly directed, written, and acted. As a teen slasher, it's a lame duck. Since the plots of all teen slashers are basically the same, the only way to stand out is with exceptionally creative deaths that push the limits of gross-out. Otherwise, it slips into obscurity. And as a movie in which Paris Hilton dies, it's unimpressive. If I pay admission (or take the time to download) just to see Paris die, I want to get some bang for my buck. Therefore, I conclude that this movie failed on every foreseeable level.",House of Wax
262,heroineworshipper,Finally a movie so stupid it's funny,1,29 August 2007,"Who would think guys ran around abandoned towns in the back woods with a pair of wire cutters in their back pockets. You never know when you're going to need a pair of wire cutters.Then of course, given a town full of dozens of buildings your friends could be trapped in, where do you first think of looking? The creepy house of wax past the end of the road of course. At least it could have been part of the main road so the characters wouldn't have to walk so far.It's always fun to imagine what the characters are thinking in these mindless plots. ""Why do we have to search the mad serial killer's pockets for bullets if there's a gun store just outside?"" ""Why do we have to go back to the creepy house of wax to look for our friends who are probably already dead and couldn't help anyway because the mad killers would kill us instead of run away and get a bigger army?"" ""Given miles and miles of vast wilderness, why do I have to find the smallest car in the most cramped garage to hide in as the mad killer slowly pounds around.""

263,robertrosado,Home Sweet Home,10,9 May 2005,"I do not think I am alone when I say that 2005 has not been particularly kind to the horror genre. While ""Cursed"", ""Hide and Seek"", ""The Ring Two"", and ""The Amityville Horror"" all showed glimpses of interest and potential, there have been more misses than hits. For proof, see: ""White Noise"", ""Boogeyman"", ""The Jacket"", ""Mindhunters"", and ""Alone in the Dark"". Imagine my surprise when ""House of Wax"", tightly written by siblings Chad and Carey Hayes, turned out to be... well, a surprise.Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a young woman, traveling with her trouble-making brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray), and boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki). They are, along with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard), and Dalton (Jon Abrahams), hoping to score tickets to the final football game of the season. Along the way, they run into some car trouble, and are forced to enter a desolate town where nothing is what it appears to be.Upon hearing of this, a remake of the classic Vincent Price B-movie, I rolled my eyes. I did not even want to think about what disaster freshman director Jaume Serra had cooked up for his audience. In a time when most high-profile horror films are disappointments, latent with bad writing, static direction, and amateur acting, I consider myself lucky that Serra and the Hayes brothers took it upon themselves to make a good, old-fashioned, spook fest. Unlike the disappointments that I named before, this flick pulls no punches, and uses every cinematic trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came for.I am happy that the Hayes' actually took the time and effort to create likable and believable characters, thus making the events that much more urgent. It also gives the young actors portraying them something grip on. As she did in ""The Girl Next Door"", Elisha Cuthbert proves to audiences what a skilled actress she really is. In the 2003 remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", Jessica Biel silenced naysayers by delivering a raw and emotional performance, one that put the viewer right there with her. Here, Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray (""A Cinderella Story""), in one of his first more mature roles, is no slacker as Nick. Murray exudes charisma and a hard edge, as well as some impressive athleticism on top of it. Murray and Cuthbert gel perfectly, and have tangible, familial chemistry.More so than anything else, the press and the American public have made a field day about Paris Hilton's major acting debut. As I expected, Hilton does not embarrass herself. In fact, she is just as good as anyone else in the movie (do with that what you will). Like Cuthbert and Murray, Hilton has screen presence. She is sexy and playful. I cannot think one of reason why she's gotten the worst of the film's harsh reception, other than they are simply picking on her. Jared Padalecki (TV's 'Gilmore Girls') memorably manages to overcome his underwritten role. Robert Ri'chard (TV's 'Cousin Skeeter') and Jon Abrahams (""Meet the Parents"") do not have much to work with, but get the job done. With only one scene, Damon Herriman (""Soar"") makes an unforgettable impression, and his presence hangs over the rest of the film. Finally, Brian Van Holt (""Basic"") is superb and threatening in a dual role.Once more, kudos must go to the screenwriters for avoiding clichés whenever possible. Despite popular opinion, ""House of Wax"" is quite unpredictable for a majority of its running time. Take this for example: It seems as if the killer is down for the count and Carly bends down to retrieve something from his pockets. What do you expect to happen? See the movie, and you will understand what I mean. It is also refreshing to see a horror film in which the characters show even a modicum of good sense.Unlike most horror scores, John Ottman's exhilarating work never distracts. However, as with Dark Castle's other releases, the visual aspects of ""Wax"" are award-worthy, and lift the film above its genre trappings. The talents of cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, production designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum, and editor Joel Negron highlight the ghoulish imagery. Speaking of imagery, I believe that the gore hounds will be thrilled with the many makeup effects and tricks in store here. Each death scene is more stomach churning than the last. Considering his past in music videos and commercials, it is obvious that Jaume Serra has a great eye for style. His ""in-your-face"" approach is a great asset to this film's success. Just when you think the camera will turn away, it does not. He is also particularly good a building thick layers of dread and atmosphere. One standout shot is our introduction to the killer, as he slowly emerges from a trap door.In a case like this, I would usually admit when I am in the minority (Shut up, okay? I liked ""House of 1000 Corpses""!). In this case, I firmly that the detractors have gotten it wrong. I am not sure why people are so hard on this film, considering it's much better than recent genre entries. Maybe they're afraid to admit that a horror flick starring Paris Hilton could possibly be worth watching... Who knows? This is a horror film, and a commendably stylish and effective one at that. As a lifelong horror fan, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed ""House of Wax"", in all of its lurid and sadistic glory. I safely consider it a great accomplishment in modern horror, as well as (along with ""Sin City"") the first completely satisfying release of 2005.",House of Wax
264,stereoplaysjunk,Spend a night in Paris...,7,7 June 2005,"House of Wax was never intended to be a horror classic yet delieves some fun, gory and interesting scenes throughout. The characters are more or less the same in any other US teen slasher movie (the big bad boy, the preppy boyfriend, the caring girlfriend, the funny black guy, the geek and of course the tart with a heart) Surprisingly, most of the actors in the film deliver quite well, including almost debut actress Paris Hilton, who obviously isn't afraid of putting herself up for a little bit of mickey-taking. The plot takes a while to develop and you sit through the first quarter wondering when the action will start, but when it does its almost non stop from there to the end. House of Wax delivers some pretty creepy scenes, and the waxwork figures are just a weird as the two main madmen. The film makes you jump throughout and often makes you cringe and turn away from the gore, but its all worth it for the fantastic ending which is definitely a worth finalé of what is a good, fun and little bit twisted slasher flick.",House of Wax

267,soccer64,A pretty decent movie,7,7 November 2005,"*This contains very big spoilers if you haven't seen the movie* Who knew you could base a movie like House of Wax on some separated Siamese twins? It reminds me of some horror-type Phantom of the Opera. Really though, House of Wax was actually a pretty decent movie. I had heard from most people that it was a pretty bad movie, so I was expecting the worst but I was actually pleasantly surprised.I originally only bought the movie because Tristan (Chad Michael Murray) and Dean (Jared Padalecki) from Gilmore Girls were in the movie so, needless to say, I was disappointed at how short a role JP got to play. His ""he-man"" haircut also was pretty bad. =P Paris Hilton did some *okay* acting (I think the best part would be for guys-her dancing in the tent), but I think the writer/director/producer should not have gone against the invisible rule book of horror stories, where they're supposed to havethe...woman of questionable morals die first, though it was cool to see Paris Hilton with a pole through her forehead. I have to add that I think that whole plot of her *maybe* being pregnant, was absolutely pointless, unless I missed the part of the movie where it actually developed into something.The last time I had seen Elisha Cuthbert in anything was on the Nickelodeon series ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"", so I wasn't sure what to expect from her, but I must say that I think she did a pretty good job, especially after having her finger cut off! That was kinda creepy. So, apart from the whole, being a tad on the emotionless side of your boyfriend disappearing/being murdered thing, she did pretty good.Another disappointing thing was the way JP's death was was very detailed (The ankle cutting was just like...""holy flaming cow, ow!"" It looked so real and painful, even for a movie.), and even Paris' death had a failed escape attempt scene before she got it, while the other two didn't really get any glorious death scene. (Although I did find Robert Ri'chard's death probably the creepiest looking.) The actor who I liked the most in this would have to be Chad Michael Murray, who knew he could be such an awesome ""bad-ass"" brother (or character in general)? I never thought I'd see him with a crossbow, and I must say, it was quite awesome. And I'm sure many girls will just love his generosity in the scene where he takes his shirt off and gives it to Elisha.One final critique, I don't think they called people by their names enough. Maybe I was just not paying close enough attention, but the only person's name (in the movie) that I could really remember was Wade. I was having a hard time keeping track of who everyone else was (or maybe I just have bad memory =P).Overall, this movie is worth a shot.",House of Wax
268,lbabe29,"A guilty pleasure of mine, a fun and entertaining slasher.",8,2 May 2010,"House of wax is a typical slasher in many respects but that does not take away from the certain charm it holds...it has pretty much everything you would want in a horror film.The plot is simple and standard for the genre. We are introduced to a group of young adults on their way to a football game. Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) a sweet yet sassy girl who is nervous about moving to the city for a new job. Her trouble-making bad-boy brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), supportive best friend Paige (Paris Hilton). Along with Carly's sweet and protective boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and rounding off the cast Dalton (Jon Abrahams) proving comic relief, and Blake (Robert Ri'chard) Paige's boyfriend who is really just a token character. whilst hoping to score tickets to the final football game of the season. Along the way, they run into some car trouble, and are forced to camp in the woods where they enter a desolate town where nothing is what it appears to be. What's nice about House of Wax is its relatively slow burning, sure there are some jump scares and creepy moments but the real action does not start until around the 40 minute mark, some might call this dull but for me it only makes the third act even more impressive.Despite the little character development, the acting is surprisingly good and helps make the characters likable. Jared makes a sympathetic turn as Wade but the real stars are Elisha and Chad. Elisha gives a great performance as Carly and is one of the better lead actresses I've seen in recent horror. She is vulnerable and strong at the same time, portraying fear very well indeed. Chad despite his pretty boy image does a good job as the bad-boy and unlikely hero of the film, he is strong and protective and you root for him as he tries to save himself and his sister. The only problem i had with this paring was the high sexual tension there seemed to be between them. There were many moments where you felt as if they were about to kiss and its almost better to just picture them as girlfriend and boyfriend during the final act.The film is of course not perfect, the dialog was weak and the big ""twist"" was hardly anything surprising as you could have predicted it from the start. The ending tried to give you another ""twist"" which again failed in the same way the previous one did....in fact the whole ending was a let down. The characters make very stupid choices through out the film such as not making sure the attacker is dead, splitting up etc and whilst these are also a given in slasher films it never stops being annoying. The third act was pretty intense though if a little short but all in all the film is a great fun ride full of scares and tension....also great kills and leads you want to live instead of hoping they would die.",House of Wax

As a horror fan I must admit I avoided this like the plague. I am unsure why? Maybe it was because of the presence of Paris Hilton or something? I just don't know. So House of Wax entered my film library only last year! OK so what did I like about the film? I mainly liked the town, of wax that is. I don't know what it was but small things like the insects crawling on the food container in the 24/7 store indicting that the place was derelict pulled me in. The town itself had a certain appeal. The cast were OK actually. Didn't really like Dalton or Blake but the rest were good. Carly was a good character and so was Nick. Paris Hilton (Paige) was actually surprising. No she's not Oscar material but she wasn't as bad as what I had anticipated. The scene with her 'dance' though was pretty pointless. The killers: Bo and Vincent were good characters. I thought that Jared Padalecki over acted a tad for me. Some scenes he is very realistic i.e. the opening scene where he clears his throat I thought was realistic but then throughout the film when he might be in a tricky situation he breathes really heavily....over acting!!

272,Killa_Cam,Tonight Our Special: Dumb Teens in Wax,6,30 July 2005,"On one hand the film is full of inexplicably dumb sequences, which should make a decent viewer loose any interest in it, but on the other there are scenes, which are so great, that the movie immediately justifies itself. So let's see... First of all I gotta tell, that (and it is quite a common cliché of modern horror films) the only relatively smart character is the black guy. Blake, pretty well played by Robert Richard by the way, had made numerous sane proposals, which, if they had been accepted by this bunch of white teens, could have saved their lives. But unfortunately the whites in the film, except for the maniacs, who are pretty witty, are actually one dumber than another. The characters are so dumb, that it somewhat harms the credibility of the movie. Here I gotta mention, that for the first time in a very long time I was actually siding with the killers, hoping, that they would kill all those morons as soon as possible! The guys are so stupid, that not only they decide to stay for the night next to a stinky graveyard, full of animal corpses, for two consecutive nights, prefer to return to an abandoned & creepy place instead of being patient enough to just wait in a traffic jam on the highway, but also keep on breaking in houses & shops snooping around in an utterly insolent manner. I mean, if I hypothetically invite a stranger to my home supposedly to help him, but what the stranger does is snooping through my personal belongings, then will I get mad, even if I am not a crazed maniac? Oh, sure I will! Yet some points of the story were good. I actually liked the fact, that two main characters are twins, which are quite different & they are opposed by Bo & Vincent Sinclair, also twins & also different. As for an attempt to develop multiple story lines & sub-plots... Well... The storyline with Paige Edwards's (played by Paris Hilton) supposed pregnancy is just straight ludicrous! Why should we care? Yet, I can't say, that the storyline with Wade, the dumbest idiot of all of them, refusing to move to New York, because he is afraid of is any better. I liked the villains though... I mean they are really crazy killers. Some scenes are impressive too: especially I liked the fake funerals, movie theater scene & burning house of wax. The visuals are good & I don't mean Paris Hilton's butt here, thought it's really good too. Some funny jokes are also there. There are some meaningful moments as well, despite the general idiocy of the characters, and this is the director's merit.",House of Wax

When i first saw the trailer i knew i would liked it, but i ended up loving it. First of all let me start by saying that i liked the cast a lot, which made me sympathize for the characters even more than it should have. My favorites were Carla, Nick, Wade and Paige. The sets were amazing as usual, Dark Castle always make great sets. The house of wax was really very creepy as well as the whole town. The killer was scary, he really freaked me out. The chase scenes were very intense and i gotta say i loved Paris Hilton chase scene. It is one of my favorites next to Tara Reids(Urban Legend), Sarah Michelle Gellar(I know what you did last summer), Maiween(Haute tension) and a few more. The deaths were simply disturbing, and i gotta say i found this movie to be more cruel and sick than many slasher movies out there. This movie had its flaws true, it was predictable most of the time (you obviously knew who was gonna die from the start). But if you go into the movie expecting and Oscar winner well you will be very disappointed. Its mainly for slasher/horror fans, or those looking for some cheap scares, gory deaths scenes, intense chases well you will surely like it a lot. I sure did! I give this a 10 out of 10. Definitively the best scary movie so far on 2005. To me it was better than The ring two, boogeyman, darkness, hide and seek and well although i did enjoy Amityville horror i gotta say House of wax is better than that.

That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere! Blake was hot,I could see myself with him if he wasn't so into his girlfriend, who is a phony Paris Hilton in a bad wig (no Chihuahaua in her handbag,though but that would have been really precious). I don't think girls who look like that go to football games anyways. Nick the car thief is the sexiest! One of the best parts is where a football lands by him, and instead of throwing it back, he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football. See, that's just the kind of guy he is. He has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wife-beater. Her bra straps are showing for, like 1/2 the movie!Mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this.",House of Wax
275,jacobhenrytucker-1,It's only because of Paris that it's good!!!!,7,21 June 2006,It was more of a thriller than a horror. It was a bit over the top because they tried to make it super gory so Paris ended up getting stabbed in the head. Although there were some excellent performances like Paris Hilton and Michael Murray. But over all it was a good production. Everybody died eventually!!! Stanley has an heiress in the making and it is quite low-budget. I would not recommend it highly. But I hope you enjoy it. For horror fans it's a bit average. And no one get's home in time. It's a bit too long as well but it's worth it.

You pretty much know what your gonna get when you start watching this. It reeks of stereotype characters and ill logic behavior. Like the nosy Wade that just finds it completely normal to enter any place and start messing around. And even more normal to leave his girlfriend behind in the place they just ""broke"" into to go outside and look for a ""creepy"" man she saw. Or if you happen to stop a man from killing you be sure to put down you weapons, don't check if he's out for good and proceed to run away. So put your brains on the shelf for the next 2 hours and you can enjoy some nice deaths and bloody gore. Apart form that there is really not much else to enjoy. The cast is not very convincing (Chad and Elisha do OK) and all in all it's a standard MTV type horror movie.",House of Wax
277,killerreviewscom,"Everything a horror movie should be.Sleek, sexy and bloody as hell.",8,8 November 2005,"House of Wax is a film that I missed seeing in the theatres. Yes, I was inconsolable. However, fast forward to six months later when a friend of mine comes over to my place and says, ""Hey boner buddy, guess what I won on Rock 101 today? The House of Wax DVD."" At this point my knees weaken. I can almost smell the wax as he reaches into the inner pocket of his pea coat. By the time I gather all my candles for the viewing, the DVD is in the player and we are ready to rock like Angus Young in 1982.House of Wax opens in 1974. We see a mother and father trying to have a nice, peaceful, sit down breakfast. It appears that these unfortunate parents have two children around the same age. One is sitting quietly eating his Cheerios while the other is completely spazing out; so much so that the parents need to strap him down to the high chair using belt buckles. The kid is kicking and screaming while his father slaps him again and again, all the while shouting, ""Why can't you be good like your brother?"" This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that proper parenting should include a healthy dose of restraints and beatings.Cut to present day. Yeah, I'll have one cheeseburger, a large fry and two super hot chicks please. Elisha Cuthbert and Paris Hilton make House of Wax a pleasure to watch. I haven't been this happy with casting choices since Jessica Biel in the Chainsaw Massacre remake. I sit on the edge of my seat, wishing the crazy wax man would slice a large chunk out of Elisha's shirt, introducing a fifth character, her stomach. Remember George pulled that same move on Portman in Attack of the Clones? Unfortunately my wish did not come true. We do get a panty scene thought and Paris performs her patented strip tease. I know, I know. What about the ladies in the audience? Don't fret little ones; you have the strong, sexy shirtless Chad Michael Murray. He was actually really good as the angry Nick Jones, Elisha's brother in the film. He was so good that I bought an autographed poster for the back of my bedroom door. Don't judge me On the DVD cover box, one of the critic quotes mentions that the film is sexy and they couldn't be more right. Not only are the girls sexy but the entire concept is as well. You have this minuscule town which is not even on a map where a psychopathic maniac spends his days building statues and other miscellaneous objects out of wax. The actual house of wax is really cool, with everything from the books to the walls to the structure of the house itself being made of wax. The faces of the wax figures were phenomenal and the whole idea that they were once living, breathing creatures is definitely creepy. I wish I could hire this guy to transform my ex girlfriends into wax statues Well, not the fat onesWhat impressed me most about House of Wax was the sheer violence in the film. It's slow going at first but once the mood and characters are set and the house has been penetrated, all hell breaks loose. By the way, hell carries two carving knives, wears a wax mask and enjoys dragging his victims back to his boiler room for a wax party. There is a moment in the film where Wax Face lays the unfortunate soul on his examining table, drugs him, cleans and stitches up his wounds, waxes his face, then places his naked body in the Iron Maiden. The torture device, not the band. You can stop playing air guitar now One of the things that I love in films such as House of Wax is the killer's use of old surgical equipment and odd, machinery - especially machinery that covers most of the face.Again, the violence in this movie is awesome. There is moment in the film when one character is bashing another character in the face with a baseball bat. I thought to myself, there is no way they are going to show the bat hit the face. Sure enough, they do and not once but about six times. The guys face was a pile of mashed potatoes. Two wax covered thumbs up! I also want to go on record saying that Paris Hilton has one of the best death sequences I have ever seen. It was most excellent. Oh, don't get all pissy because I gave that away. If you thought there was even a 0.3% chance she was going to survive the one hundred and thirteen minutes of horror then you don't even deserve to be here. Now go away!Overall, House of Wax kicks total ass and is definitely my favorite film from Dark Castle Entertainment so far. I thought the girls were unbelievably sexy, the villain was creepy and intense, the set design was unique, the special effects were awesome and most of all, the directing from Jaume Collet-Serra was great. House of Wax is just my cup of tea. It is so refreshing to see an R rated horror film that holds nothing back. I am really surprised they got away with an R rating. Some of you will find moments to bicker about but what can you do? It's a horror movie! I am going to buy my own copy of the DVD this weekend. Yes, I recommend House of Wax.",House of Wax

LOL It was cool, I don't know why its not higher rated. Great Originality and Pretty Damn Scary Too! Lot of great acting especially for new comers. I thought Paris did a pretty good job too, she actually seemed like a real person and not one of the wax figures like she does in real life he-he The plot was original and had a lot of detail. I liked the way it all came together in the end, like when the twins were laying together being covered in wax, it was the same position they were in at birth. I'd give it a look.

I have also heard a lot of praise about it from our patrons that have come in to watch it. It is a great study in art in wax, but there has to be a better way to do this than by using real people. I am going to be weary of going into a wax museum the next time I see one. I have been interested in how they make movies like this for sometime now. It was a very interesting process how they did this. Those figures were so life like that it was if they were real people in under that wax, even they were not. Congrats on doing those figures so life like.",House of Wax
280,generichorrorfreak,"horrible beginning, probably a horrible ending..",1,1 October 2010,"Alas, I did not manage to get through the whole movie. And maybe the ending is good, who knows, but this movie starts out so horribly and meanders on and on with all the things that are wrong with horror movies nowadays, that I could not bring myself to keep watching after a certain point. For starters, what a ridiculous cast list. ""Hot"" young actors from UPN sitcoms and TV dramas and Paris Hilton is NOT the part of the recipe for a good horror movie. Will it get people to want to see it? Probably, but if that's what gets your attention then you in fact just might like this pathetic excuse for a horror movie. The acting for the most part was amateur. Acting like a butthurt college-kid isn't as easy as it sounds, obviously a lot of people seem to think it is, and in House of Wax you get a lot of butthurt-college- kid-acting that will make you want to roll your own eyes and pout. Paris Hilton is actually NOT the weakest link, believe it or not she's one of the better actors here and I think she could have a decent acting career.. this was just a horrible movie to star in. The movie goes on and on without anything actually happening. In some movies, this is pulled off very nicely and you don't need an elaborate plot jam packed with twists and turns to make it interesting. In other movies, such as, oh, House of Wax, all you really get is a group of annoying college kids that whine and bore you to death incessantly. There's nothing to keep you interested in the meantime, so be ready for half an hour to an hour of college kids doing what college kids do.. trying to get to a football game. Hahahaha.. I wish I was joking. If you think a lot of new Hollywood horror movies are trite and dilapidated, skip House of Wax because this is definitely one of those. If you think the guy from One Tree Hill is sexy and you want to see him play the role of a so-called bad boy, you'll probably get at least something out of this movie.",House of Wax

The movie has a great all star cast 24's former star Elisha Cuthburt, One Tree Hills Chad Michael Murray Thresholds Brian Van Holt Famous Heiress Paris Hilton, and Supernaturals Jared PAdelecki. Its about two brothers who run an abandoned down filled with wax figures. When collage friends end up stranded in the town they do not realize how much of trouble they are in. It was scary especially the famous death scene with Paris Hilton getting a wooded pole stuck through her head every one was happy when that happened because every one was hoping that a girl like that would bite the dust hard and cold. Elisha Cuthburt and Chad Michael Murray are the only two survivors this movie isn't based on a true story but it seems it was much more scarier than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

283,narulagaurav,Absolute manure for the garden,1,9 March 2006,"I like Elisha Cuthbert - enough to buy anything featuring her. And find Paris Hilton sexy enough to support the first call. However, this movie really did me in - the gore was there, the chills somewhat there, but the rest of it just nowhere to be found. Ridiculous as a storyline, sad as a commentary, the improbability factor ruled throughout the length of the movie. Come on dudes, we are in 2005, not in 1905 - we know how Saimese Twin separations are done, how wax can be used, and how it cannot be. The suspense was sad too - all the wrong music at the wrong times, and clichéd. When 2 people can run an entire town is when I think the global problem of power distribution is gonna be over. The town not on the map is funny too. Miss the movie, 'coz seeing it will mean you rue the 1.5 hours you would have spent there.",House of Wax
284,jwoehr,Creepy and actually scary,7,12 May 2005,"House of Wax is the kind of horror movie Randy from Scream would've picked apart. 6 friends on a trip to a baseball game camp out in woods that smell like rotten corpses. Yet they still stay there for the night. They even still stay after a creepy truck flashes it's lights at them and then leaves. When they wake-up one of the cars just happen to not start and the kids are still thinking ""duh what is going on ?"". They made the truck driver angry obviously and he did something to the car and none of them even think that. Plus they see a creepy guy throwing dead deers in a big pile and they actually get in the car with him when he offers them a ride. Then when they get to town to get the car part they need, they meet a creepy gas station worker. He says he has the part they need but that it's in his house. So they get in the car with him as well and then one of them asks if they can use the bathroom in his house. So yeah not hard to imagine what will happen from there. Still though it's fun to see what mistakes they will make next. Like when a killer is after you do you keep running or hide in a car ? If you were in this movie your answer would be hide in a car ha-ha. It's easy to pick this movie apart but it's still not that bad of a movie. A town full of nothing but wax dead people is pretty creepy. The whole look of the film is well done. Plus the acting isn't really bad either. Paris Hilton will probably be knocked a lot but she's really not that bad. There's been much much worse performances in horror movies. Also there's some inside jokes about her in there. I mean she gets video taped a lot in the movie. When of course she also likes to get video tape in real life... Chad Michael Murray (One Tree Hill) plays a tough guy who's just hanging around with his sister (Elisha Cuthbert) to bug her and her b/f. He blames her for being sent to jail thinking she ratted him out. Murray plays a tough guy well and he's pretty nuts to charge the killers in this and try to fist fight them. I don't think anyone watching the movie would wanna fight them. Elisha Cuthbert who is used to running and screaming in 24 does a fine job...running and screaming here as well. I liked the Ring 2 but I had a better time at the movies seeing house of wax. It's fun, creepy and scary and had me at the edge of my seat. The killer with the wax face is one of creepiest killers I've seen in a horror movie in awhile. The movie starts off slow but once it gets started I think it's pretty entertaining.",House of Wax
285,rachelrachel-33431,Brutal Remake,8,13 October 2021,"While billed as the movie where you get to see Paris Hilton die, House of Wax has much more to offer than a campy death scene for a vapid reality star. The set up is classic slasher routine - some friends break down and go into a deserted town to ask for help, noticing the one big landmark is a wax museum made entirely of wax. Of course, the figures inside aren't your run of the mill wax figures but are, instead, real people who have been murdered and encased in wax and there's room for a few more in the exhibit.Most performances are naturalistic and believable and the murder scenes impress with their brutality and intensity. It takes a little while for the terror to get started, but if you can wait a little while, you won't be disappointed.",House of Wax

Lots of suspense and chase scenes too (villains chasing the ""good guys""). Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray and Brian Van Holt and the rest of the cast were awesome! It was also Paris Hilton's first movie and she did pretty well. There were tons of surprising parts thanks to loud music and instances where the villain just pops up out of no where, so be ready for lots of screaming, people jumping off seats and a few people doing their nervous laughing. A lady next to me kept hiding under her jacket and asking her girlfriends to tell her when the scary parts were over so she can watch again but they kept tricking her into watching during the scary parts and she kept on screaming really loud. It was hilarious! It was funnier when a dude in front of me screamed out loud with a voice like he just hit puberty...ha ha!

287,lmcsharry,Horror Montage,4,31 July 2006,"Okay, this isn't awful. As a no brainer slasher it's amusing. Some of the scenes are scary, the concept of the wax preservation/moulding is scary. Some of the gore is well done, the pit of carcasses is pretty scary, the injuries are toecurling - or for Hilton, heel-splitting! My score of 4 is for a few reasons, Paris Hilton is not one, she's plays her part adequately, none of the other actors are Laurence Olivier either. 1. I've seen all this a million times. The abandoned vehicles of tons of victims, the disfigured killer, the middle of nowhere-ness, slack jawed menacing yokels. Probably cos I'm a horror fan and watch a lot from the genre but this film is Wrong Turn, Hallowe'en, Wolf Creek, Creep, Texas Chainsaw Massacre all bundled together, with wax. Ah wax. 2. Wax. How much wax could one town of two people accumulate?? And what sort of bloody wax was it?? The museum is in the searing sun of hicksville and the corners are sharp, the sign is crisp lettering, it hasn't melted even a little? Puh-lease. And when it melts and our dashing 'good twins' claw their way to escape, they don't get burnt. Obviously. This wax which withstands the sun, melts at a less then handhot temp. (You know a film sucks when you notice stuff like this). 3. Really awful symbolism. Good twins vs bad twins (with an 'Evil' twin motif. Ugh). All of the shots that play on the fact there was conjoined twins - the cutting of the wax babies, dying in the position they were born. Awful stuff from a smart alec director. 4. The 'dandan daaaaan' ending of ""that's not real ambulance...."" How many crazed killers live in the vicinity anyway? So leave brain at door and enjoy what you can.",House of Wax

The film manages to build up a dark palpable tension and has a creepy Gothic atmosphere; unexceptional - though interesting - protagonists and a fine (award worthy) psychotic performance by Brian Van Holt.For a modestly budgeted horror film, H.O.W. is technically excellent in all departments. Although gory in sporadic bursts; it is the undercurrent of sadistic violence; it's threat of what might or can happen, that lifts this film out of your typical run of the mill slasher flicks.In my personal opinion, the best horror film of the noughties so far!

293,lomelasz,"Paris, Chad and co give horror remake an edge",6,31 May 2005,"In Hollywood, timing is everything. Mega-producers Joel Silver (The Matrix) and Robert Zemeckis (The Polar Express) have been remaking ancient horror hits under their Dark Castle label for a while, but early efforts House on Haunted Hill and Thir13en Ghosts failed to make much impact. However, their 're-imagining' of a 1953 b-movie classic arrives just at the moment when horror rules the plexes, and with a sexy young cast to boot. Six pals are diverted en route to a major college American football game, and camp overnight near a creepy waxwork museum - and a pit of smelly animal carcasses! A broken fan belt in one of the vehicles splits the sextet into smaller groups... ready for the slaying to begin.If I'm going to watch young Americans tangling with a creepy psycho who has a penchant for turning humans into waxworks, then frankly I'm happy the ensemble includes Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray - the scene where he strips off his wife-beater vest to lend it to his sister is a gesture we can all appreciate. And the whole icky waxwork angle is a novel twist on the usual redneck freakshow carnage.However, the nudge-nudge humiliations heaped on Paris Hilton - she is videotaped by one of the pals seemingly giving her boyfriend a blowjob - made me wonder: if there anything she won't do for fame? And despite the script's belated attempt to justify the film's extravagant conceit, plausibility is beyond its grasp.Overall, the clichés - the wrong turn, the creepy backwoods types, the psycho childhood story - pile up, but I'm not going to pretend the film doesn't add up to an entertaining package. Above-average production design and special effects prove valuable assists, making for the one of the most convincingly slimy pictures I've yet to have had the pleasure to witness.

Unlike most slashers and certainly most horror films of that period, House of Wax takes its sweet time in getting to introduce us to its characters. Unfortunately, these characters are mostly nothing more than your average teen/college archetypes, so it's not like the film spends much time developing their characters since there's not much there to begin with.What does build during this section of the film is a decent sense of atmosphere and dread. While these people aren't the best developed, they do at least seem like real people, so we do start to feel for them when they're put in harm's way. By the time House of Wax gets to ""the good stuff"", it's off and running and it doesn't stop to give us a breather for the rest of the film.All the death scenes are inventive and pretty grisly. These aren't just a quick stab here and there - these filmmakers want us to feel their pain. There's even a good chase scene or two.

Perhaps in the next generation of teen horrors we'll get naked men being chased? It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen- that award probably goes to Cabin Fever; and as someone else pointed out- the cast were fairly likable, aside from the two hapless boyfriends with no apparent surnames.

On the way, the group decides to camp for the night in a remote grassy area off of the bumpy short cut they have taken.After drinking, spoofing the infamous Hilton sex tapes and an awkward encounter with a truck, the group awakes to find the fan belt on one of their vehicles broken.

There are definitely parts of this movie that are creatively done and will make you jump.However, the bad part of this movie is that it takes too long to get to these scenes. The first hour of the movie is the group taking about the trip, driving, and camping. By the time all the gore comes the boredom and sleepy eyes have set in. Most of this should have been cut back to make room for more gore.Overall House of Wax isn't horrible, but it only deserves two out of fours stars. It's fun for a rainy day/night and some cheap thrills, but it's not something I would add to my DVD collection.",House of Wax
299,kensdal,House of Wax was a decent slasher flick with a great theme,10,14 August 2005,"2005, for me has been a good year for horror movies, with the exception of The Ring 2. I thought House of Wax was a very entertaining slasher flick, with a theme other than just a deranged serial killer. This movie had a great teen cast which included Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Micheal Murray, and the one and only Paris Hilton. While I was expecting some pitiful acting, the acting really wasn't that awful and even Paris Hilton did exceptionally well. Although it seemed alittle obvious of what was about to occur to each character, the deaths were still great. At many scenes I found myself thinking ""how will they escape?"" or ""where will they hide?"". there was no nudity in this movie but Paris Hilton did strip down into her lingerie. This movie was also gory and had great death. It includes a finger cut off,decapitation, skin turned to wax, skin peeled, a rusty pole through the head, a knife in the throat, a baseball bat bashing, and quite a few foot stabbings. If this all sounds appealing to you, I would be sure to see this movie in the future, like when it comes out on DVD, which may include actress Emma Lung's death scene.",House of Wax
300,PWadeThompson,Interesting Remake,7,2 May 2005,"Let me start by saying I was looking forward to seeing this movie because the original gave me nightmares from the time I was 5 until I rented it while I was in college. I like that a character in the film is named Vincent; it's a nice homage to Vincent Price, whose disfigured face in the original inspired said nightmares. Plotwise, this remake is a complete departure from the original, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I was expecting a cheesy, teen slasher flick; what we get instead is a sometimes cheesy, sometimes funny, more suspenseful than scary, gory, waxy mess of a flick that I found quite enjoyable. Early on, I had an inclination as to which of the six friends would be alive at the end of the movie. I was not disappointed when I discovered I was right in my guess. I really enjoyed the literal take on the composition of the house.",House of Wax
301,xcver,Yet another bad horror movie,2,24 May 2005,"This seamlessly puts itself in the line with a lot of other bad horror movies that flush out of the US movie-works lately. The story, a classic, group of young strangers came to a deserted place in the wilderness and separates themselves to get chopped to pieces except the 2 survivors. So this is a classic setup which is so stupid in itself, that even the movie tries to make fun of it. At one time an actress questions the act of going near something that stinks foul with something like ""why are you going towards it?"". By the way I found Hilton on equal acting level with their counterparts. But then again this movie didn't need acting. In the end it wasn't frightening, it wasn't scary and the story was badly drawn.I just hope this stream of bad horror will end soon. A 2/10 from me for this waste of celluloid, time, money and everything else (even writing this comment).",House of Wax
302,getmeagasmask,"A satisfying movie, perfect for any day",8,30 July 2007,"Alright-- you've seen Paris Hilton in the trailer and saw her face on the DVD case, but rest assured this movie is well worth a watch. Paris' purposely humorous appearances in the movie are minor, and her acting isn't horrible. Her part plays in the balance with the little romance fling, which is minimal but still adds to the movie nicely. There are parts that jump out at you and there is pleasant suspense, and even a little bit of family trouble is thrown in between Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and her brother (Chad Michael Murray); all of this is depicted in a perfect balance that won't leave you feeling confused at the end or force you into trying to figure out a tricky plot puzzle-- it's played out and sequenced well, always leaving you in anticipation for the next scene. However, bare in mind this is a horror movie and there are some gruesome parts that will make you want to choke up your soda. If you think you've seen all the brutal gore scenes in movies, think again. This movie has scenes that the industry has never seen before and isn't too cliché. House of Wax exceeds expectations, and if you're looking for a good thrill, a substantial horror, and some stomach-knotting gore scenes, this is the movie for you. A sure- to-be classic for any horror lover.",House of Wax
303,Juliusus,"House of Wax, best horror film ever!",10,15 December 2007,"I can see by the low rating (5.4 stars) that this movie is getting bad reviews only because of Paris Hilton. But I can say that Paris Hilton has a pretty decent performance. Good thing she dies shortly. I was actually cheering by the way she had died. Overall the violence is spetacular. The acting is above average (except for Paris Hilton who had a decent performance.). The town was genuinely creepy and the wax figuires was... WHOO!. There is one person who I would never have thought who would die first. Jared Padalecki, the lead's boyfriend. This movie is so brutal that it was awesome. The blood was believing and the motive was good. The only problem I have is that the killer needs to have a scarier appearance. House of Wax, recommend for all you horror fans.",House of Wax
304,FireWave,The film has fulfilled my expectations,8,25 December 2009,"House of Wax is one of the best horror that I have ever seen.I accidentally on TV saw trailer for the film and made me interesting, so I decided to watch it. Watching the film, I was afraid, but as the minutes passed, I realized that it was one of the few horror films that deserve to find the top 10 list of best horror movies. The killings were terrifying and they did not have the classics in themselves.There was enough upheaval that only improve the scene and brought me into great uncertainty.Acting and story were fantastic. All in all, producers and writers have made a great film that is definitely worth watching and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good horror movies.So,my rating is 9/10.",House of Wax
305,casperthegoth-1,Excellent... For what it is...,10,9 May 2005,"... Don't let the art house snobs tell you that this movie is awful because they have finally discovered international horror. If you go into this film expecting an artfully directed, elegantly acted, scary and deranged horror film, then you are asking too much. That simply isn't what this film sets out to do. In fact, if you know anything about horror films, you'll note that this isn't even what Dark Castle (the production company) sets out to do.All films by the company are intended to either be direct remakes, or films in the vein of William Castle horror films. Gimmicky, cheesy, and, most of all, a good time. This film has respectable acting, respectable screenplay, respectable effects, and respectable creepiness. I highly recommend this for anyone who can put their pretension at the door and sit back to enjoy a film for the sake of enjoyment.Why a ten? Because knowing all this, I was very impressed with the intensity of the final scenes, the special effects, and the creepiness of the atmosphere. Excellent for exceeding my expectations... the best Dark Castle film remains House on Haunted Hill, but this is a close second! Excellent Work! I hope to see more!",House of Wax
306,filmguy_07,"A slasher flick that is... well, a slasher flick.",6,7 May 2005,"HOUSE OF WAX is one of those movies that I had my expectations met, which is pretty much a good thing. It displays itself as a sturdy slasher film, but nothing so inherently innovative that it screams out for attention. This is the kind of movie that you go see with a group of friends after you've done some drinking. It's not to be analyzed too harshly.First, what was right with it. HOUSE OF WAX displayed some of the more graphic gore than I've seen from a slasher flick in a while. It will definitely quench the thirst for any gore fans, and chances are it will give the novice horror film enthusiast or the horror film lightweight a knot in their stomachs. Secondly, the acting I have to say was pretty good. Paris Hilton didn't make a complete ass out of herself, which I figured she would. Lastly, when HOUSE OF WAX decides to throw in the action, it comes. It delivers major ass-kicking appeal, and it will definitely have you saying, ""Damn."" Now, what was wrong with it. My first and biggest problem with HOUSE OF WAX is that it was approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes by my count. This is a pretty lofty time for a slasher film, which isn't necessarily bad, unless a slasher film does what HOUSE OF WAX does and take too damn long to get to the point. Slasher films are meant to feel swift and dangerous, to which this film sometimes feels slow and tired. Furthermore, the plot is nothing special, your typical slasher film plot, in the shades of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, from which it seems way too many horror movies are spawned. When it comes to character development, not only is it not interesting, it is also slow, considering that it takes HOUSE OF WAX forever to give it the appropriate development it needs.Ultimately, I give the movie a 6, because it gave me the gore I required for a slasher flick, yet it didn't do anything to absolutely wow me. HOUSE OF WAX is a slasher flick that is... well, a slasher flick. Definitely worth checking out if you're a slasher film buff or you're out for a night with your friends.",House of Wax
307,JonL-2,I owe it to the gore,4,7 May 2005,"The only difference between wasting 110 minutes at the theater versus 110 minutes at home, is the $6 matinée price. That and you can either get up at the boring parts or fast forward thru it. I overheard the box office employee at the cinema say that on opening Friday night, they sold 17 tickets to House of Wax. Still, it earns its R rating for the gore. Some of the effects aren't too bad, but that's not saying much for this predictable, intellectually insulting piece of pop crap. Nonetheless, the writers and actors waste no time in making you want to know that these teenage boobs get what they deserve (except of course, the dual heroes). Maybe the 40 minute setup is meant to bore you to the point of wanting them to get sliced. My friends did say it was worth $6 to see Paris Hilton get speared.",House of Wax
308,Ladiezman911,Just got back....and I'm still shaking,10,7 May 2005,"I just got back from the theater and I am still shaking....Chad Michael Murray, yes a heart throb for all the young ladies, also, as it turns out, is quite and exceptional actor. Known for his work on such projects as Freaky Friday, Murray could be this generations Tom Cruise. He and his twin in the movie, Elisa Cuthbert, were a terrific on screen team. Cuthbert, who also is a decent actress (she has time) could be the next scream queen. First Jamie Lee Curtis, then Neve Cambell, is Elisa Cuthbert to be added to that list? But the movie. Besides from the opposite of lackluster storyline, the movie was extremely watchable. Compared to other horror movies this year (Boogeyman, Ring 2, White Noise) this one was actually scary not just for the jump and shock value. I would put this film in a different category, this movie is more resemblant of SAW. The f**ked-up value of this film is high. On a scale of 1 to 10, Saw being 10, this is like an 8. It messes with your head in a way that you will be saying, ""make it stop!"" My friend next to be who is not scared easily was shaking, I was screaming, but the old guy next me, was laughing, (now that's f**ked up!) Don't be rag doll to the critics. See this one for yourself, it's worth the money.",House of Wax
309,dbentley4,Came out feeling good,6,15 May 2005,"House of Wax is quite surprisingly watchable. I think it scored most effectively by actually AVOIDING the most predictable elements. There was no gratuitous nudity and sex. Mind you, I like nudity and sex, but in these movies it's usually placed in a moralized frame: rich, self-indulgent, horny, immoral teenagers are punished by older, repressed male wielding chainsaw/axe/knife. In fact it's been an unsavory staple of such films (since Friday the 13th, maybe even earlier) that we are encouraged to be moralistic voyeurs. Enjoy the nudity, and then thrill with moralistic horror when the nubile young things get their comeuppance. House of Wax doesn't do too much of this, thank God. It's absolutely required in such films that the young protagonists do VERY stupid things. But here they avoided doing VERY stupid things. Going into the House of Wax itself was stupid, but the plot made it unavoidable. (Mild spoiler coming up) Not killing off the villain when he was down and out was stupid, but not VERY stupid, since he looked VERY dead. Splitting up instead of staying together was explained quite skillfully (different investments in wanting to watch the ballgame). Best of all, the baddies met their ends in very satisfactory style, with no coy directorial signs that they would return to life for House of Wax 2. The pacing was excellent, and there wasn't too much stretching out of suspense with the camera giving us the killers' point of view: a device that's been so overused that they should place a moratorium on it for ten years. I actually came out feeling good, and thinking how nice it would be to find an entire town made of wax, preferably when I was equipped with a flamethrower, some grenades, and a good, tanked-up car. I was wondering, though, wouldn't it melt in the sun?",House of Wax
310,myspacebf,Really good- so much better than most at the time,9,30 May 2020,"It's 2020 and I watched house of wax for the first time, cause you know- quarantine and nothing better to do. I expected a really bad, baaaad movie. I mean, no shade, but Paris freaking Hilton is in it. But wow, I am in awe! Let's get the negative out of the way real quick: half of the cast, including Jared Padalecki's character, have very inconstistant behaviors. He goes from the good boyfriend stereotype to total douche who's snooping and messing around real quick. Second point: even if Paris was better than I thought, the strip tease was not just unnecessary but also cringy. I also would have lead a good life going forward without all the boob close ups, but hey.
Now on to the positive: the other half of the characters were very smart, they fought logically and within their capabilities! The bad guy(s) we're also not super human, and nobody 'forgot' that they were injured heavily a scene ago. I appreciate that! The gore, violence and all things wax were fantastic!!! And I mean fantastic! It was so grounded and realistic that I wanted to sympathy vomit at least once... Not to mention the symbolism and similarities in story telling. I haven't watched a horror movie which I liked this much in ages!!!",House of Wax

Unfortunately I could not finish this movie entirely so I rented it later on and I must say, I was pretty surprised. Of course it isn't anywhere near Oscar material but compared with other remakes you can do a lot worse than this.As you already might know, this movie is a remake of the original House Of Wax from 1953 (which was also a remake of an earlier I've been told), starring the legendary Vincent Price. As with all horror remakes, the original cast was removed and replaced by a group of adolescent bimbos who get lost and get killed for no reason etc. I have not seen the originals so I can only judge this movie on it's own merits.Once you ignore the predictable and cliché story (group of young people get stranded and lost etc.) and focus on the overall mood and seting you'll be in for a pleasant surprise. The wax house itself and all the dolls are well made and the suspense is nicely built up. Only the ending is a bit lame but did not stop me from enjoying this movie.Like I said, for a remake you can do a lot worse than this.",House of Wax
312,noazrk,Great Gore & suspense....but NO Paris touching wax and saying THAT'S HOT!???,8,5 May 2005,"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???).There is NO nudity from the 2 girls although Paris looks great in her lingerie! I'm surprised they didn't put a 3rd ""hot token victim"" in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick! I won't list any death or plot spoilers BUT I will say that Paris & Eliza both get roughed up good! The characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable (not like Cabin Fever where you wanted them to die) and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the 1st 30 minutes like most horror films.I give it a 8/10 as it delivered good scares and gore and I had low expectations going into it.

Then all of a sudden they showed a preview for this movie. At first it looked really lame. But then I kept on seeing the preview and then it started getting interesting. So I did a whole bunch of research on this movie to give me a good idea of what it was a bout. Then, not too long after that. I knew I had to see this movie. So I went to see it, excited as ever. When I came walking out of the theater, I was happy I saw this movie. This movie was Rated R for horror violence and other stuff, so I wasn't really expecting this movie to be gory. But the movie was pretty bloody and gross. The kills were really neat, the wax figures were really cool looking and the house of wax burning down was really cool. The only thing that kind of sucked was that the fact that I knew who was gonna die and how. I found out on the net when I was trying to see how gory this movie would be. But the thing that kept this movie from getting a four was how long it took before the kills happened. Meaning talking and stuff. Which don't get me wrong, is kinda good so we can kinda feel for the characters. But there was some characters that were just boring so why waste time on them right?

The story is pretty simple a group of college kids go on a road trip, and through a series of events end up in some weird town, featuring the main attraction, The House of Wax. Added into the mix are the psychotic caretakers who want to add them to their collection. This film is filled with a lot thrills and scary moments that should keep you on the edge of your seat from 90 minutes. Of the actors, Chad Michael Murray and Elisha Chubert are tops.

I seemed to recall seeing the bad rating on the IMDb so I was expecting some real trite garbage.This movie is quite good for a horror flick. Nice and violent & gory. Could have been a bit more suspenseful when it got going, but good nonetheless.I must say I despise Paris Hilton in almost every way - and I tend to think her presence is why this movie has such a poor rating. However her performance was tolerable... considering she really wasn't in the movie that much. It's too bad people voted it down just because she was in the movie, because I just don't get how it could get such a bad rating.As for all the other actors, decent to good.

If this movie had a PG13 rating I would not have bothered with it. The ""R"" at least assures me there will be some gore, like the Paris Hilton, death scene, which was great. I am sick of these PG rated horror films with little violence and no gore. Pg movies may bring in more kids and dollars but the quality of the Horror film suffers. Horror films should be Rated R. House of Wax did have plenty of grisley scenes to deserve an R rating even though I would have liked to have seen more gore. I guess I will have to wait for High Tension. I do recommend House of Wax and if the made a sequel I would go see it. House of wax may not melt the competition at the box office but it will make the studio plenty of money.

318,lauriesavage8,An underrated movie,8,1 June 2006,"I personally enjoyed this movie a lot as it was fully of exactly what I like to see, hot guys and plenty of blood and gore. The actors in this movie really outdid themselves by turning the crappy lines they were given into something to be respected for. Chad Michael Murray was brilliant in it, as he always is, and Elisha Cuthbert whom I hadn't seen act before I thought was fantastic. Paris Hilton...well she wasn't as bad as everyone makes out. She was the main reason I didn't want to watch this movie but someone pulled my arm and I watched it and I thought she was good, not amazing but passable. In one scene she did come across as the Paris that everyone knows in a strip tease but I didn't completely want the killer to catch her so her acting musn't have been that bad. I was very surprised to see one of my favourite actors in this movie, Jared Padalecki, as I didn't know he was in it. However, I was not happy that he was the first to die either, shame on you writers to spoil such a pretty face. I was blown away by the special effects in this movie. I didn't think there would be many but at one point you get to see someone's head actually cave in and the skull crush as it is hit repeatedly with a baseball bat, which I thought was fantastic special effects. I hadn't seen the original movie so I didn't know what to expect, the overall story wasn't fantastic but it was good enough to keep me glued for an hour and a half. Overall a top movie and everything the critics said about it are false, lets face it, these days critics are only interested in life asserting movies such as Crash and Vanilla Sky and throw aside a good old nasty horror like House of Wax.",House of Wax

BEWARE! House of Wax was a great horror movie. Although it started off slow it gained points for its character development. Unlike most horror movies where people die right away, nobody dies in this movie for about 30 minutes. The death scenes were well done and creatively thought out. Someone gets their finger chopped off, decapitated, waxed alive, stabbed through the neck, stabbed through the foot, and a pipe through the head. All were very gruesome. I must say Paris Hilton was perfect in this movie. Her chase/death sequence was suspenseful and gruesome. She, by far, had the best death. However, the best chase scene in any horror movie still goes to Sarah Michelle Gellar in I Know What You Did Last Summer. Paris's chase/death scene was about 7-8 minutes and it was the highlight of House of Wax. The special effects at the end of the movie when the House of Wax was melting down were magnificent. However, I did not care for the very end of the movie. It kind of just cut off. I still give the movie 10 stars because it does not deserve the low rating it currently has and also because Paris Hilton's sequence will always be unforgettable.

321,villiards,Ummm.... Mr. Theater Manager.... Could I have my money back?,1,6 May 2005,"This movie is just sad, sad, SAD!!! Elisha Cuthbert has proved that she's a decent actress in ""The Girl Next Door,"" as well as the hit television series ""24."" Why she felt the need to do this utter pile of garbage is beyond me. ""House of Wax"" is just another in the long line of generic ""horror"" flicks that features stereotypical, angsty teen-agers who stupidly end up confronted with a twisted killer, who probably doesn't have the mental capabilities to drown a sack of kittens. The movie's story is slow and predictable. When something frightening finally does happen, it usually doesn't ""scare"" viewers as much as it grosses them out with over-the-top special effects.In addition to all of this, we have Paris Hilton. Despite being good for one or two lines that poke mild fun at her, she is more of a detriment to this film. Her acting abilities are pain-stakingly bad and completely unconvincing, even though the character she plays isn't much of a stretch from her person in real life (if you believe the grocery store tabloids, that is). Fortunately, her role in the film is small.Overall, I feel this film was a major waste of my time and money. Paying the full price for this over-hyped wasted of film just isn't worth it.

323,Artistic_Differences,Beautifully twisted. Satisfyingly gross.,7,16 July 2005,"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted. After the arrival to the village, though, the horror -a different, twisted kind of horror- begins.With the plot and the details, goofs are minor; the characters are this movie's strongest point, given that so many clichés are broken in it. For example, the two main male characters, Nick and Wade, are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to; although Dalton might fit better in this stereotype, not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are truly, satisfyingly horrible, making up for tense moments scattered around all the film. And, in the end, and although everything is decorously explained, it's easy to see that things won't go so easy to the surviving characters.The only errors I can see, and which do not imply continuity (IE, Carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious Bo's pockets) is the illumination, which is somehow annoying during the first, boring 30 minutes. Although, plot and effects-wise, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to Ambrosia, that little village in the midst of nothing, so I'll give it that. It's been pretty much argued that about 70% of the movie is illogical; ""How can two people build an entire house of wax?"", ""Where do they get all the wax from?"". These wouldn't be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; their mother worked making actual wax figures, and they were exhibited at the museum. And the scenario where Paris Hilton's unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question; what is with all the personal objects (mobile phones, cars, clothes) of the dead people? Using their third brother as a connection with the exterior, it's pretty much arguable that the Sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax, in a WWII-type fashion.So, that aside, I think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets, and nobody should lose the chance to watch it. So go see the House of Wax. Right now.",House of Wax

As a result, the wax melts; the characters seep through the stairs and walls, and try to claw their way out. It's a wonderfully-orchestrated sequence, and a fitting denouement.

325,Schro,Like watching 2 different movies,4,2 January 2006,"The first part of ""House of Wax"" is like a generic teen slasher, except nothing happens and the characters are horrible. None of them can act worth a damn except the brother and sister, but you won't really get to see them get good for a while. A good movie will make you really feel for the characters and them dying off will make you a little sad. But almost all of the ones in here you HOPE die.The second part is great. It's like you're watching a good fantasy horror movie. This is the part where you get to see the brother and sister characters actually act. They become the center of attention, and all the characters I didn't like get killed off brutally!(Paris dying is the most rewarding thing I've seen in ages) Yaaaay! The concept is very interesting and I think could have been pulled off well for a great movie.Unfortunately it was ruined by really awful editing and casting. It's worth it to rent for the latter half. It's also full of unanswered plot holes like: Where did they get all the wax from? If you'd really like to you can skip like the first 1/2 hour to 45 minutes without missing much. You would most likely be doing yourself a favor, actually.",House of Wax
326,Zarathustras_Crown,"Alright, worth it for the hardcore",6,6 May 2005,"Just got back from seeing this movie and I'm somewhat on the fence. If you're a fan of the classic ""slasher"" flicks, Halloween, Friday the 13th and such then you'll see all the ""quintessential"" bits here.Now don't get me wrong, nothing in this movie is ""new"" as such, you can tell they tried very hard in order to keep the gore top notch (in one scene one of the characters graphically gets his face beaten into hamburger), but the ""story"" (as I'm sure you'd have already guessed) is your standard fair.The movie starts with our protagonists setting off to see a nearby football game. One finds a shortcut and decides to use that in order to shave off time. One thing leads to another and, lo and behold, a ""detour"" sign pops up. Our jolly gang decides to pull over and camp for the night. During their nightly reverie an eerie looking truck pulls up and just sits with it's high beams on them. One character gets angry and smashes one of the lights out...guy drives off and the night goes on as per usual.Next morning, late to wake up one of the cars is discovered to have a broken fan belt. The two girls wander into the woods in search of a ""smell"" and one ends up slipping down a huge hill into a large pile of rotting animal carcasses (with a hand poking out). Cue creepy hick-guy to come in his broken down truck (not the one from the night before, but almost identical) and offers to drive the characters to a nearby town in order to get a fan belt. Two of the characters agree, the others drive off to go to the game (the others ""will meet up with them"" of course).The lucky pair ends up pulling into a town somewhat reminiscent of the one in ""children of the corn"", completely deserted and dilapidated. They can't find anyone in the gas station and walk into the church interrupting (seemingly) a funeral. Ends up the mechanic is in there and comes out and tells them he'll ""be 'round"" in half an hour...while later he shows up, what's this? No fan belt...but ""I've got one in my house""...Needless to say this results in much bloodshed and fun for all. All in all, this was a pretty good film...it wasn't really worth the 9.50 I paid to see it, but I would happily shell out a couple bucks to rent and watch at home. Overall, not too ""scary"" as such, many of the kills seems almost like homages to other horror films. For example, one character, after the necessary chase scene, ends up having a sharp rod thrown through her head. This reminded me very much of the scene in Children of the Corn 3 in which one woman falls on a water pipe and it goes through the back of her skull causing blood to pop out her mouth like a sprinkler. Almost all the scenes in the ""house"" (you'll know what I mean) or the killers abode is STRONGLY reminiscent of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.This is a fun movie, if you're into gore and slasher-style movies this will be right up your alley. The story is woefully sparse...you discover something about how the two brothers involved were Siamese twins but don't really get into any depth with it. Had they gone with that idea they may have drummed up some sympathy for the protagonist villains. Instead they basically fill the time with discussion and people being slaughtered in creative manners. All in all, a fun flick. just don't expect anything intelligent or new, go looking for a lot of gore and scantily-clad women running around and you won't be disappointed. :)",House of Wax
327,joanneburton-66331,"Well Made ""Remake""",8,2 August 2019,"House of Wax may be inordinately long for a slasher film, but it's not without its perks. It doesn't share much with the original Vincent Price film besides the title and the concept of dead people being encased in wax to make the exhibits extra lifelike, but its story is worth telling anyway.House of Wax tells the well worn story of a carload of young people who, due to a series of bad circumstances and poor planning, end up in an abandoned town where the star attraction is a wax museum (that's actually MADE of wax - don't think about that too much) and the only people alive are a mechanic and his psychotic, bloodthirsty brother who have been killing people and dipping their bodies into wax to use as exhibits.The cast of young people are better than average and even Paris Hilton doesn't embarrass herself in her tiny role (she's also given one of the smartest lines in the script where she urges one of her friends not to investigate a funky smell in the woods). The characters are given a little bit more material to chew on that usual with the first 20-45 minutes being mostly character development, which is a rarity for horror (especially slasher) films. Some of it is worthwhile and adds some dimension to the characters and some of it could have definitely been streamlined to shave off a good 5-10 minutes.The real star here are the effects which are appropriately nasty featuring severed fingers, pole jammed into heads, knives in feet, brutal baseball beatings to the face, tendon cuttings, and one particularly grisly premature wax burial.",House of Wax

There were exactly two times, that I enjoyed this movie. 1st, when Paris Hilton Died (the only reason why many of us saw this movie). 2nd, when the end credits rolled. This movie is still at the top of a very long list of movies I wish I had never seen. I could actually feel my IQ falling.The Movie is stereotypical, at best.

""House of Wax"" has a genuine creepy feel with good performances from Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt and Jared Padalecki.With the classic plot of a group of teens going on a trip when suddenly things go awry, there are moments that are unexpected and leave you thinking even after the credits have rolled. There are clues given throughout the film that give the audience a chance to piece together what the hell is going on before it is revealed at the end. Those are always the best sorts of movies.Though there are moments of 'classic horror movie plot syndrome' that may cause some to chuckle, it makes up for it with the special effects, semi-original themes and the antagonists. I'd call it a pretty damn good two hours of entertainment.7/10",House of Wax
332,hlnma4332,filled with gore but not scary,4,5 November 2005,"Back in May when it was released in theaters I was actually really excited to see this movie, so my cousin and I went to go see it but I wasn't allowed in because I am not 17. I was very upset but I'm now glad I didn't pay $8 to see it. It wasn't horrible, but it definitely wasn't a good horror film.I rented this movie last night because first of all I wanted to see what it was like, but most importantly, I wanted to see how Paris Hilton was as an actress and it came as no shock that she was stiff and not good at all. I rarely jumped, and there were barely any actual scary parts, mainly just gore. Almost all of the actors in this movie disappointed me with their performances, and probably the only 2 that I actually thought were OK was Elisha Cuthbert and Jared Padalecki, but of course Padalecki was killed off rather quickly. But I was actually very surprised with how long Parist she was impaled in the head with a spear (nasty, yes). All the killings were rather gory as well, and the gore was present throughout the whole movie ( decapitation, impaling, mouth being glued shut, getting cut up with large scissor-looking tools, a finger getting cut off with wire-cutters). Overall it was just a mediocre movie with tons of gore and ""hot"" actors wearing wife-beaters and taking their shirts off.

Who cares right its a slasher flick and there is rarely one with a great script, its all about the jumps and scares along the way, add a few gruesome death scenes and hey presto! Yes however House of wax didn't really deliver anything for me. There was nothing new or innovative about this at all, it started way to slow, and I was left there wondering if anything was ever gonna kick off. Finally it does, a few death scenes later, all of which have been done before, well with the exception of 1, and we are done. Absolute dirt, there weren't even any jumps or scares along the way, it was just to predictable and did I mention CRAP! It was just Texas chainsaw massacre with a load of wax dumped in and thats about your lot. As a movie I was expecting to be jumpy and quite tense it turned out to be a BIG letdown. I would say watch this movie but don't expect anything new from it and don't expect it to be as good as other slasher stuff out there, some people will like it but I just thought it was a waste of time.I rate this movie, in fact forget it I don't rate the muck at all!",House of Wax

And it's even more disturbing when you realize that he's still alive even after he's put on display.What I just can't figure out is - what killed Paris Hilton?

335,ericpop27,Too Bad My Confusion Wasn't The Truth,4,10 May 2005,"When I originally heard of a ""House of Wax"" remake, I was excited because I loved the original...or so I thought. Turns out I had it confused with ""Waxworks"" an 80s movie with a VERY similar plot about a wax museum of dead people. So I eventually decided to see House of Wax anyhow. I literally had to talk myself into it. The trailer doesn't make it look particularly exciting, but then again it wasn't. Nothing actually happens until the second half of the movie. Teen stereotypes? Check. Cast of familiar faces of young stars? Check. It wasn't as gory as people claim, a lot of it was decidedly fake looking. Too bad it wasn't a Waxworks remake. In HoW two slashers/brothers kill tourists that visit a desolate town 'not on any map' and coat their dead bodies in wax creating a town of wax, not of well known celebrities or stories. There's a bit of a lame back story similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre. In Waxworks, a curator and his assistant lure visitors in the suburb/city to the museum. The naturally curious visitors, of course, cross the velvet ropes into the displays of well-known horror stories. Once they cross into the display, they are sucked into the REAL story, a time warp of sorts, and once they die they become the wax-figure victim in the display. House of Wax's storyline is just weak, tired, predictable, and most of all - overdone.",House of Wax
336,tricky1,Watch the trailer instead!,2,10 May 2005,"House of Wax (spoilers) I actually come in when a guy gets his Achilles tendon snipped off, so I got right into the killing and avoided all the boring crap at the beginning. Lots crazy and typical slasher stuff start, and never stop, till the end. The town is a ghost town because of the sugar mill closing (shouldn't it have been a wax factory instead? cause where are they getting all this stuff?). disturbing and unbelievable acts of violence (like how does a one eyed guy get such great depth perception to peg off Paris so cleanly?). Seems like the big revelation in the end was there's another brother ( who looks like the Deliverance mongoloid with the banjo) still alive! OH NO not another ball of wax remake! Cause thats what really scared me (more than the whole movie). As for Paris (Hiltons) first acting role, wasn't that bad compared to all the crappy acting already around her. Elisha (Cuthbert) has came along way from ""National Geographic for Kids"" (I think she was way better in that show too), she is the only A actor here, only because they found so many bad actors to surround her with. If your a sick and deranged creep (enjoy torturing innocent animals), you should love this!

I was about half way into the movie before I discovered Paris Hilton in it - and quite frankly, she does quite well (to my surprise!) It's genuinely scary, it's visually very interesting, and even pays tribute to the old ""haunted house"" in a wonderfully twisted and untraditional way.

But the other actors weren't great either except for the brother and sister who lived. they did fine. Paris's little booty call The Cousin Skeeter kid was terrible too. The movie started getting good the second Paris died. The other 2 made a great escape from th house of wax.Overall i only saw this movie because the girl from the Girl Next Door was in it.

Paris takes the cake with the worst acting as she lets her breast do it for her, preturding in every scene shes in with that laughter too "" he......he......he"".there only two reasons to see this flick; one is the obvious see Paris die ( though i think a pole through the head really wouldn't have affected her as she does not have a brain to destroy in the first place but any way)and second is the haunting beauty of the final scene in which the house of wax melts.",House of Wax
340,HorrorFan112490,Best 'Slasher/Horror' flick to come out this year!,4,4 November 2005,"This year, I've been kinda disappointed with the dry scary movies that have come out. From 'Hide and Seek''s release in January, all the way up to October's crappy 'The Fog' remake. I was hoping this movie would beat out these piece's of crap and it did. With spectacular deaths (Mr. Padalecki's being the worst), great production design (The museum was a truly phenomenal looking structure), and some pretty good ole teen horror, it did better than it had to be. The only problems were some of the actors (Cuthbert, Van Holt, and Padalecki were only note-worthy), Paris didn't do as bad as I thought she would but she still wasn't that great and I was very pleased when her death finally came, and some of the script needed to be rewritten. Example: When Vincent and Carly are in the top room of the melting museum, she tries to persuade him that he shouldn't do what he does and that his mother wouldn't've wanted him to do it and she breaks out with this cracker-jack line: ""PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!"" Which made him forget what she said and he went right after her. Like always, Chad Michael Murray can't fulfill his role like in previous roles. Brian Van Holt, truly great, it was time he swore off of police and officers and took on a more complex role. Elisha, always good-looking, really shined in this one just like Miss Biel in 'TCM(2003).' Jon Abrahams did okay as the group goof ball. Robert Ri'chard was on an 'par' acting level. Damon Herriman was pretty good as toothless hick (A lot better than Paris). Jared Padalecki is with Cuthbert and Holt here, he did a swell job for an underwritten role and he was only in the film for about 47 minutes.Special Effects were very good in certain spots, but when Murray and Elisha are climbing out of the giant A and the signs starts melting, you could tell that was the worst part when using the effects because it looked so fake. Aside from that, they really put CG to good use.The Script could've done so much better though some times. Like I said before, Cuthbert's line really kind of stunk. And at points, the other characters could've had better reactions to their situations.If I had gone to see this in theaters, I probably would've been scared a lot because so many scenes made me jump (Like when Paris is in the tent and its dark, then the killer enters and she thinks its her boyfriend and so she turns the light on and -BAM-, that made me jump high!) Definitely rent it first, decide if you like it, and if you do, buy it. If you don't, hey its freedom of opinion! We don't all have to like the same thing.

I've driven in remote ares like this so the town is quite believable and the plots and twists do the film justice. Clearly it's to be expected there'll be a big fire and the effects shown that event are excellently executed making you want to pick up your feet lest they disappear beneath you.

A bit derivative at times but pretty good nonetheless. Two best scenes: Chad Michael Murray takes off his shirt, and Paris Hilton's big scene is well, satisfying to watch. Neither scene was long enough but the plot holds through until the end. Only real flaw...it sets itself up for a sequel which, of course, cannot possibly be much good. If you like horror films, I mean truly appreciate the art, this film is decent but highly enjoyable. Not as gory as it claims but very, very good for a modern, big-budget reproduction (read: title theft) of a good classic.

347,miss-marissa-xox,I was crying with laughter rather than out of fear.,2,3 June 2008,"Heres some of my views on this horrific movie: 1. The whole Paris Hilton 'aka Paige' really added a lot to the movie didn't it?! Please realise my sarcasm. Honestly, what was the point in it? In fact, what was the point in her, other than to add a bit of humour when she gets a pole shoved through her head with such precision. Basically this film just reminded me that Paris Hilton cant act and she should really just stick to what she does best: nothing.2. When the very stereotypical teens get stranded in the middle of nowhere with their good GPS system, isn't it a coincidence that they had tents? Weren't they going to a football game not a Glastonbury concert.3. If i was to find myself in a town made totally of wax i would be very scared. I wouldn't decide to look around the neighbourhood hoping to find something interesting because as Elisha Cuthbert 'aka Carly' points out 'It's all wax'.4. Did they not think to call the police at any time? Any time at all!5. Most of the characters played no 'real' part. They weren't needed. I feel the producer put them in there so they could be killed in 'interesting' and 'creative' ways.6. How did the wax building survive in America heat for God-knows how long? Those people who built them weren't architects and so wont have a clue how to preserve wax meaning that those buildings should merely be puddles.7. I actually pitied the homicidal, wax obsessed killers. Anyone who must work 24/7 rebuilding melted buildings deserves an 'awwww'. I mean they clearly have issues.8. Why the hell would you get a lift from a guy who looks like he has been dragged through a thorny bush feet first? Then, one of the 'smart' teens, Wade, decides to go for a wander around hobo guy's house to use the bathroom. Honestly! The guy keeps knives in his car, so why then would you go the WC anywhere that he recommends? So, all in all, i feel this movie was a HUGE disappointment. I could have directed/produced/acted this whole movie on my own and it would be better than it was. Please don't waste your money on it.",House of Wax
348,david-bacon,Come on !!!,7,7 August 2008,"Any movie that has Paris Hilton getting killed deserves at least plus two or three stars above the first rating. As a movie, it's pretty trash, but again it's suppose to be. It's a teenage-die-almost- everybody kind of movie and accomplishes that quite nicely. A five overall in my opinion. But there is the best scene in the film : Paris getting killed. Not for the cinematography in itself, but for the act. Never cheered so much for the bad guy since Pirates of the Caribbean ( throw the first rock who was cheering for Orlando Bloom character.) Then I throw another two stars. The story itself is not so bad ( don't look for logic, I learned it spoils most of the movies you watch, just enjoy the story and mentally-skip the idiotic parts) exploring the theme of madness instead of revenge and gives a reason why the main character is alive. The Scream movies always gives you a attack to Sidney in the middle that, if successful, would spoil the explanation in the end, also concluding it. Again, turn you logic off. Also pleased me that the survivals SPOIL were brother and sister, not the good looking guy with the defenseless girl who falls in love with him.

My tension was lessened however when most of the theater cheered when Paris Hilton's character died. (I saw the movie in a theater that college students regularly attend.)The ending of the movie leaves it open for a sequel. I'd be interested to see if the stars who survived this movie will agree to be in a sequel.I'm actually quite glad I saw the film. The movie was surprisingly well done and I enjoyed it. You will not be disappointed. Every one of my college aged friends that has seen the movie has given me a favorable review of it.,House of Wax
351,auds008,Worth seeing free on HBO...,3,25 June 2005,"This movie was hardly anything spectacular. The only thing that saved it was its great casting (with the exception of Paris) and over hyping through the MTV's ""The Making of House of Wax"" specials. Paris was in it for a total of maybe... 10 minutes? And she played a knocked up blonde bimbo with a black boyfriend. Go figure. The story line was pathetically predictable too. Overall House of Wax was just a pointless gore-fest, much like the recent Chainsaw Massacre re-make. Save your cash, and don't waste your time seeing it in the theater or even renting it. Catch it on HBO in a few months or better yet, get it for free from your local library... It was just a pointless movie without any solid plot behind it. But hey, if you like pointless movies that kill off the characters you actually grow to like throughout it, check it out.",House of Wax
352,skippydouche,"Awful, yes",1,26 April 2005,"I just saw this movie and I have to say it was one of the WORST movies I've seen in a very long time. The plot sucked.....the sets sucked....the horror was cheap and lame.....I just wanted to see Paris getting killed.....which actually got applause from the audience.If you want to see a good horror film, don't waste your money here.....you'll be sorely disappointed.I'd give it a negative number, but it was free, so I give it a 1/10....and that's being nice. Vincent Price is rolling in his grave over this crap.I'd rather pee glass than have to sit through another minute.I'm going to puke now",House of Wax
353,david-1824,"It should have been called ""The Louisiana Paraffin Massacre""",3,6 May 2005,"Some folks at Warner Bros actually referred to this as a remake! I suppose, in fact, it is, but it's not a remake of 1953's ""House of Wax"" or its predecessor, 1939's ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"". I was concerned that the producers would do to this what they had previously done to ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""13 Ghosts"". They have substituted largely unsympathetic characters, improbable situations and plot, and random, gruesome shock effects for mystery, suspense and fear. If you like the genre of ""teens who lose their way in an out of the way locale and get killed one by one"", then this will be your cup of tea. If you've seen any film with Texas or Chainsaw in its title, or the much superior ""Wrong Turn,"" or the myriad Freddy/Jason/Michael films, you've seen this before... many times before. Spoiler Alert: Paris Hilton's character comes to a violent end... and the audience in the theater cheered her demise! Perhaps that's a wise showcasing of taste. Wiser, still, would be to watch either of 2005's ""House of Wax"" earlier incarnations.",House of Wax
354,buckswope1,Totally effective and scary b-movie trash... entertaining despite Paris.,8,8 May 2005,"WOW. I was shocked to enjoy this movie as much as I did. This is exactly the type of gory, profane, illogical, totally fun and suspenseful trash that the giant popcorn bucket was made for. Paris Hilton is totally flat and more annoying than ever, but it's great fun watching her die. Chad Michael Murray is laughable and miscast as the tough guy, but you end up rooting him on. Elisha Cuthbert keeps making nonsensical, classic-girl-in-jeopardy mistakes, but she also gets brutalized, making this one of the first horror movies I've ever seen where the heroine doesn't just walk away in one piece... The production design is impressive, the pacing is absolutely perfect, and the story is just pulpy enough to keep you interested. If you want truth and drama, see HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS. If you want to see a hard-R, big-budget b-movie done right, see HOUSE OF WAX.",House of Wax
355,SamanthaPrice,Not so hot.,4,26 June 2008,"The gore was okay, it worked and I preferred it to the cheap blood thrills of ""Hostel"" and the like. The plot was typical teen horror fodder.The cast was nice to look at and the majority could act (just too inexperienced to work magic with an appalling script), even Paris Hilton wasn't bad.The baddie was kind of creepy, maybe could have been creepier? That's just my opinion.I think the failure of this movie was the group, they weren't friends and that could have worked for the film in the end but it didn't. Twins (see what the director and writer did there?) - brother and sister - Nick and Carly (Murray and Cuthbert) resent each other. Nick and Carly's boyfriend Wade (Padalecki) don't like each other. Nick seems to keep annoying gnat buddy Dalton (Abrahams) around because no one else likes him. Blake (Ri'chards) is there as he is boyfriend to Paige (Hilton) who is friends with Carly. It isn't breakfast club, there is no bonding opportunity, they don't all try to save each other. Wade sends the others off when his car breaks down and Carly sticks by him, the others toodle off and come back when they think some dire is wrong, sorry could that truck not tow the other car to somewhere else? So what was the point? None of them needed to be where they were and yes, whilst I am well aware that scream-teen films very rarely make sense until it gets to the gore and cheap thrills could they not have come up with a slightly more believable premise.The basis was stupid and there is no time to care about the characters. There was no personal investment. I, for my part felt sorry for Wade as he is stuck somewhere with a bunch of losers because his girlfriend wanted to go to the game  I assume - as he no other reason to be there, poor guy.Paris Hilton wasn't as bad as I thought she was going to be, although I think she was playing herself rather than a character.Just a note if you are renting the DVD. Go into the extras and watch the commentary. They have 4 of the actors (Murray, Hilton, Cuthbert and Padalecki) talking through some of the scenes, it's done via split screen so you can see them sat on the sofa discussing the outtakes, behind the scenes footage, etc. Whilst what they have to say is either mundane or just typical stuff usually discussed their interaction is actually pretty interesting and will either endear to the actors or not.",House of Wax
356,KDMiller,Burning Down the House,3,19 May 2005,"The third film based on Charles Belden's play entitled ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" (1933) targets generation X-tasy. Twin screenwriters, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies--a promising start. Their condition guarantees an authentic point of view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not much of a stretch for the world's favorite heiress. She peruses ""In Style,"" stripteases boys, chats on a cell, and frets over an ill-conceived pregnancy. Her regular routine has been altered beyond repair. Hilton reached the peak of her performance--not so hot--during the ""1 Night in Paris"" (2004) parody. While the pimp-my-ride is in motion, she zealously ""looks for lip balm"" in her boyfriend's (Robert Ri'chard) lap. Finally, the ""actress"" atones for using the ""N"" word on the sex tape. Director Jaume Collet-Serra molds his take on the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past. Each exhibited opposite characteristics back then, whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the womb today. However, the latter does not rule out the former. Childbirth constitutes the luck of the draw. Spectators can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a contemporary Quasimodo. Granted, the recluses share some similarities such as artistry, disfigurement, submissiveness, and murder. Yet, one small variable between the two makes all the difference. Vincent is even uglier on the inside than he is on the out. Collet-Serra's ""House of Wax"" pays homage to actor Vincent Price from the first remake in 1953. The film leaves obvious van Gogh puns to the imagination of the audience. Still, the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod's unmasking receives runner-up, but the most terrifying one in horror movie history belongs to Lon Chaney in ""Phantom of the Opera"" (1925). As far as the new contender is concerned, the aftermath of separation surgery downplays the effect. A surgeon should know operating on Siamese twins scars them--physically and psychologically. Their father needs to call a couple colleagues--Dr. Phil to consult and Dr. McNamara to nip/tuck. Despite what the trailers said, ""Wax"" is not forever. In fact, you can rid yourself of it by burning it.",House of Wax
357,DD_Shadow,Horror and Paris finally delivers!,5,16 October 2005,"I must admit I began watching this flick with a lot of skepticism as to whether or not it would actually be even *minimally* entertaining. The second I heard Paris Hiltons role in it, I swore that the whole thing was ruined. Goddamnit, I was wrong....sort of. The movie opens with a bunch of college kids heading to the city for a football match when they camp in an isolated location on the way and one of their cars mysteriously breaks down due to some part screwing up or something. And...as with most horror flicks of this sort, the people have to venture into some creepy deserted town where they are confronted by a maniac duo who turn unfortunate visitors of the town into real life wax sculptures, hence the movies title, House Of Wax. From there its just a load of chase scenes with some gory moments, the most enjoyable of which is Paris Hiltons entertaining and extremely satisfying demise. I mean, a pole through the head, how much sicker can that get? Displayed in all its gory detail. The movies climax is pretty abrupt but OK since the Paris death scene obviously satisfied most who went into it with low expectations. Overall, House Of Wax is a fun, yet forgettable horror flick, sub-par like most remakes of classic movies these days. Horror fans rejoice. There's plenty here for you.",House of Wax

Not pretty much though, don't think that the good part of this movie can be spoiled by knowing something of the story line.Two nice things inside - some bloody moments and Paris Hilton's ass. And two jokes. Very stupid movie. More brainless than Texas Chainsaw Massacre, otherwise pretty much the same. Did the director tried to explain how didn't the cops try to search this city... there were about 30-50 dead bodies there. And the main characters did not feel pain at all. Are they immortal or senseless??? Not scary at all. No suspense. No horror. Nothing clever in the story, just another family of maniacs. No mystery.Whatever... Don't watch it",House of Wax

(one being the death of a certain socialite) The gore was satisfying, the plot riveting, the creep-factor increasingly present, the unnecessary sexuality showed up eventually and the special FX with the wax was well done. The one thing i didn't like about this movie is who ""gets it"" first. But that's just me.While I didn't find this movie frightening, i found it effectively creepy. The very idea of being made into a wax sculpture to be on display forever is not appealing. The ""big bad"" in the movie is also a perfectly sketchy character(s). And there were these two parts that really made me cringe... okay, three. I recommend this movie. Watch it with the lights off.And I would definitely think twice before entering a wax museum or small town again.",House of Wax

Some people didn't go and see it cause Paris Hilton was in it but she was amazing in it and really surprising. SHe didn't have the biggest part but she played her part very well. Chad was my favourite, especially times when he was lacking in clothes! The cast worked really well together to achieve such a high quality scary film and i advise anyone to go and see it, but suggest you go with some one as there are some scary parts in it which you might need a hand to hold or a back to hide behind! The set was also amazing, especially the house and the church. It was amazing... go and see it and watch this space.......",House of Wax

I was surprised.Hilton gets a lot of 'stick', and perhaps with good reason sometimes? However, a relatively no-one comes out fighting. Praise to Paris for her input to this film.I was expecting a predictable, boring and similar horror film to what's already been done twice over. But alas, no. The film was gory from start to finish. The special effects were tremendous and this film definitely deserves some credit.I've voted 6 out of 10, but this is good for me. Above average, not fantastic, but on effort alone... yes! It ticked all the right boxes. Not to mention such stunning cast which was definitely aesthetically pleasing and easy on the eyes. Not bad for a horror!",House of Wax

The plot, if it can be called that, is about some college kids going to a football game, when they come across an abandoned town. At the center is a house of wax where two crazy killer twins live. The kids are sliced and diced and displayed in wax. All the characters are really just stupid. Carley( Elisha Cuthbert) wants to follow a smell. Nick (Chad Michael Murray) wants to spit up the group. Both Cuthbert and Murray should stay with their day jobs on TV. They are absolutely terrible here. Most puzzling though is Paris Hilton. She is the only character who is smart, likable, and the only one you wouldn't want to die in the end. That being said, Hilton should not have been cast in this role. She is the best actor in the movie, seriously, but this was not for her. Someone likable should have had this part.

Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he was going to be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to Brian Van Holt. He played the bad guy too well, I mean he was sick, sadistic, and very cruel. The back story between the brothers was good, plus I liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film. It gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best bud of CMM. I liked how Chad kind of cried when he found him dead, it was better then just him being like, ""Whatever, my buddy is dead, who cares"". It showed how he really cared.

Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job and the death sense were great.

But had a really good story and was worth the wait. I especially liked how it wasn't just another teen slasher flick I really enjoyed the story that was very detailed.

I definitely think it was one of his better roles, he was able to pull off that rebellious character very well. I wasn't expecting it to move as quickly as it did. The first half hour or so is pretty slow, but once they get into Ambrose it goes so quickly, its just like on death after another. The murder scenes are pretty intense and fairly realistic. I have quite a strong stomach and i couldn't watch some of the parts. I think in all the whole general idea of the story was really good and it had some really good symbols and themes going on. I think Elisha and Chad had great chemistry and worked well together. It had a lot of parts where you're screaming at your television because of the things the people are doing, like you know even as they're doing it they shouldn't, but they do anyway and in the end they get screwed.

I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The movie is stylisly filmed from beginning to end. The mood of film is set early on and carries through the movie. The movie's plot is extremely similar to that of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Six kids driving in cars take a detour into a town from hell where there is a deformed serial killer. However, there are more details and twists to the House of Wax story (with even a little of a twist ending). The acting in the movie is also pretty good considering its suppose to be a teen horror flick. I'm a guy and I don't really see what women see in the sex appeal of Chad MM but he far exceeded my expectations in this movie, I found myself actually not wanting him to die. As far as Paris Hilton in the movie, she carried her own, she was basically type cast as the slutty school girl of the film. There's even a scene of her giving road head in the film which I found hilarious. I laughed at the girls in the movie who made constant comments like ""she sucks"" ""what a bitch"" out of sheer jealous. Anyway, this film is a first rate horror movie for teenagers and adults alike. It's twice as good as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake in my opinion. Get some friends, get some beer, and go see this movie. It kicks ass.",House of Wax

House of Wax had some twists and turns and keeps you guessing until the very end-- which is still twisting! I could have sworn that one of the brothers (towards the end) was going to be driving the ambulance so that twist was WAY out there! At the beginning, I found the camera views to be a bit odd but it made it more clear what was going on at the different times. It almost seemed to have some tidbits of reference to 'The Sweetest Thing' (scene with the lip gloss) and also reminded me of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' in some scenes. Never did find out what exactly happened to the one guy's video camera though-- I just thought of that-- and they never mentioned where they found it either.

I mean we have all heard the rumors and hell Paris Hilton's last movie that was good was done in night vision. So like most, at first I stayed away. Not going to the movies to see it or even renting it for awhile. Then someone told me it was a good movie and I had to trust them, so I rented it. At the beginning it seemed like a normal teen slasher, but as the story went along it got out of the normal and went into more of an adult horror film. Each death was planned and different, but all held the same characteristics, like a normal serial killer would do. When the movie ended I thought it was good and rated it in my head 9 STARS. But then I went to the special features and looked around and clicked on the deleted scenes/bloopers: with cast commentary. Now the deleted scenes/bloopers were fine; but I was disappointed to hear how idiotic the women and the cast were. Now, after watching the movie and the deleted scenes/bloopers, I went back and watched it again.

379,lee-porter-1,they want Elisha to do WHAT with her lips?!?!?!,3,7 October 2005,"As much as I admire dark castle for their efforts in remaking classic horror movies, I don't necessarily agree with them. I admit, I enjoyed ghost ship, 13teen ghosts, house on haunted hill and even, to a degree enjoyed house of wax; it was no exception when it came to admittedly groundbreaking set design (a lot composed entirely out of wax as the medium) I still think the original is a lot better, and no matter how much the production staff insist it to be a homage to the original, you can see that it aches to live up to its name (one of the twins, for example, is called Vincent). The whole outline of the story is set in an abandoned town in America, closed down simply because the trade dried up. Vincent and his brother, who had grown up in this town, obviously decide to take advantage and turn the whole place into a literal town that never wakes up...again. All the townsfolk are composed of people who drifted off the beaten track, and are in turn turned into wax figures.Oh hell I can't do this completely seriously, I mean really; with the contributing factors being that the original far outshone this in every way, told the story far more stylishly, how did Joel silver and co. REALLY get deluded into thinking this would be a success? I only watched it myself because I have a deep and profound dislike for Paris Hilton, and positively applauded with joy when Vincent aided her to a grizzly end; she does do a nice striptease though.In all fairness, there were some really cool visual effects in the movie...I admit that there were very few special effects and some of the camera-work was really quite good; the direction and the enthusiasm of the cast was somewhat lacklustre, but tolerable to a degree. Even Ms. Hilton was reasonably convincing as far as her requirement to act as if she knew what a scholarship or even the concept of saving money meant.I would seriously point anyone who's looking for Elisha cuthbert to hire out 24 or the girl next door, as she delivers far better performances, would recommend one night in Paris for anyone really wanting to see Paris contribute to the movie world, and would quietly hope that the rest of the cast die a slow and horrible acting career, condemned to a life as extras or starts on days of our lives.

The rest of the cast are very cool, laid-back, and cute! Who would turn down that kind of movie? No one. The best movie about cute people, deadly wax, and twin killers is this one.The movie takes place in Louisiana, where 6 teens spend the night at a random place. The action starts when Chad Michael Murray's character throws a rock at a weird truck in which the driver was apparently watching them. The action goes higher and higher as Jared Padalecki's character dies, then the murders start to pile up and in which, in my opinion, Paris Hilton's character dies the worst.

382,yolandaeverrts,waxing poetic,10,27 February 2019,"I love this movie. Its a visual rollercoaster that perfectly matches the waxy theme. Some really creative death scenes, and the bad guy is beyond creepy. Hilariously, Paris Hilton's sex scene is way sexier than her real sex tape, and her death scene is the highlight of the film (not just because we all want to see her die). It's a weirdly satisfying film, with that crew of early 2000's beautiful people. Definitely the kind of movie I'd watch again, and show to fiendish friends.",House of Wax
383,ickleaztek_15,Everything a Horror Flick Needs...,10,5 March 2006,"House of Wax is absolutely the best horror film I have seen in a while. This movie includes young Hollywood and a plot that will have you thinking ""who builds a city out of wax anyway?"". Chad Michael Murray and Jared Padalecki work great together. Although, I have to day I was saddened when Wade (played by Padalecki) was the first to be ""waxed"". I was thrilled that this movie featured many of our young and talented actors. Most are the best in the business and can be counted on to do any character. Take Chad Michael Murray for instance. In this film, he plays a careless, drunk smoker, but for his character in the WB TV series ""One Tree Hill"" he is the calm, collected, ""soul-mate"" of Brooke (played by Sophia Bush). Anyway, getting off topic a bit, so I'm rating House of Wax 10/10 b/c this film is really well made, there maybe a few glitches, but there's a few of those in every movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves young Hollywood, horror flicks, and great special effects! House of Wax Rocks!",House of Wax
384,varn8165,good for a horror remake,7,15 May 2006,"I originally expected to hate House of Wax. I had seen the original Vincent Price version and liked it, but i categorized this film as another crappy horror movie remake produced because no one in the industry can come up with an original idea anymore. I was pleasantly surprised though. House of Wax isn't really a remake seeing as the storyline is completely different from the original. If you ask me, this story is a little more intriguing than the original and definitely scarier. I was pleased to see a minimum of stupidity in the characters and also that character relationships were built on and matured throughout the film. If you want to watch a quality slasher flick, i recommend House of Wax.",House of Wax

386,smmcgill-1,"Superb!, intense and gripping storyline..",9,16 July 2006,"Along similar lines of ""Wrong turn"" where a bunch of young dudes in cars end up getting lost and stuck in a surreal world where life has stopped. The idea of a whole town being ""kept alive"" or dead as the case may be, by two twisted brothers is fascinating. The story centres around a town called Ambrose that has been abandoned ten years ago because of an interstate being built that has bypassed the place. The brothers have being capturing motorists from the surrounding area for years, killing them and covering them with wax, to strategically place around the town like macabre dummies. The couple who enter the town soon find this out as they notice things are wrong... The film is very well planned and constructed apart from the bit earlier on where Paris Hilton and her boyfriend (who are part of the original group) go camping and have numerous sex sessions. This element of the film is weak and contributes nothing to the storyline, only it seems to add to the films list of famous names and add a element of sex.. doesn't work at all in my opinion.. Aprt from this the rest of the film is superb, well worth watching!!",House of Wax
387,kon_mc,A real great horror movie!,8,8 July 2006,"After a long time, I found one great horror movie that is ''House Of Wax''. It has a fantastic script and a fantastic cast as well. Especially Paris Hilton and Chad Michael Murray are really hot-t-t!!! Anyway, the whole scenery was not fake at all. Instead, it seemed absolutely real, actual and possible to happen (well, while you watch it).The ''bad characters'' of the movie were really scary. They were amazing! They were Siamese twins: the one had a scarred face with freaking good special effects. His brother had a regular face... but only for the first seconds. After you found out he was a true psychopath to the bone, all the regularity was at once gone! In the film, there is a whole house made of real wax! And also, there is a whole town made for it (!)(I watched the DVD bonus material), but I don't know if it's made of wax! What is the most thrilling is the graphics. The best graphics you'll have seen for a long time.This film has also very good scenes with fighting, hunting, running and hiding. We're talking 'bout real terror. A really enjoyable movie.Kostas.",House of Wax

The story is fine for this type of horror movie: Some kids make a wrong turn and ends up being hunted by hillbilly serial killer.There's no stupid and unnecessary nudity, and you almost don't notice that Paris Hilton is in it. It isn't scary, but quite frankly nothing is, if you're a victim of the Danish tax system like me.So go for it, if you're into this kind of horror film.

If you don't like horror movies then don't watch this movie because its the perfect horror movie. It has everything a horror movie should have and more, and it isn't sugarcoated. So all you wussies who hated this movie maybe you can go and watch a walk to remember and cry your little emotions out.Now, back to the movie. To start things off the characters were very well portrayed, Carly and Nick were actually acting like siblings. The lines were great, their acting was right on the spot and they had so much back story behind them it was crazy, good crazy.The horror scenes themselves were perfectly made, the right amount of suspense, nice dark atmosphere of fear and death, and then the cherry on top of the cake, the amazingly well made kills. I won't go in too many details but they were so awesome you could feel their pain through the screen.And the wax was awesome, the deception behind luring strangers into a ghost town and... sorry, too many details. Its awesome do, I won't reveal the end but it is very surprising.Now some may say its illogical, but people, its only a movie. Does it really have to be logical! Its fiction, its to entertain and if you look at a movie with a logical perspective your just going to like documentaries, every fictitious movie has some illogical parts in them, tough. Want logical, watch discovery channel OK nerds! That's all. If I could give more than 10 on 10 I would, but alas I cannot. Aloha!",House of Wax

This film Sucked and should be spoiled before seeing it, so read this if you want your movie to be spoiled! Wow, I liked the previews better than the actual film. Maybe because it took almost an hour before anything interesting happened.Anyone who thought House of Wax was a great thriller should die in a really big fire with lots of flames... and then be sculpted by Vincent with hot wax that burns peoples flesh off. I guess I don't understand the complexity of some peoples brains that are exhilarated by the lack of complexity in films. Really, this film did not have me jump in my seat, scream, or block out the screen with my hand. I stared at the screen like Andrew Largeman from Garden State did on the plane. Boring!!!!!!!!! ZZZZZZ The only cool thing that happened was when Paris was killed with the pipe, (Thank god for that broad to be put down). I laughed when everyone in the muscle car thought that Paris was giving her BF a BJ with night vision filming (HAHAHAHHA) Hint Hint? (Yeah I bought the video at an adult video store) Oh yeah! Chad Michael Murray was a high roller ""G"" in this one. I can remember him being a sensitive playa in ""A Cinderella Story"" and a flamer in ""The Lone Ranger"". He turned out alright in House of Wax; especially when he shot that dink with the cross bow - that was tight!!

Paris Hilton... well, I never thought she could act. She actually cannot. But, she is not as horrible as I expected her to be. There's enough blood and insanity to keep watchers alive till the end of it. And of course, there is the wax... oozing from every pixel of your screen, like pus. No it's not exactly the gore that made me love this movie, it must be the feeling, the fact that I realized how much I'd love to visit this house,to touch its exhibits.

393,monkeyyyy_dude,Horror by Numbers,4,31 May 2005,"Not going to go into it massively but it was below par... it was how to make a teen horror film while desperately trying to make it not quite so predictable, but failing.I think that far too many films these days are being made in a desperate attempt to fill the void of a quite frankly stagnated industry. Too many young and inventive writers and directors are not being given the opportunities to make the films that they should be making and are forced to panda to the people that pay. The large corporations are only interested in filling seats by the use of large scale marketing and the potential draw of the ""hottest"" stars in a film. No offence to Paris Hilton for getting a part in a film, but please don't put a lame ""in joke"" about her in it. Its about time that the film industries head honchos realise they need to re focus their ideals and produce thought provoking and ground breaking films back into the cinemas. Don't get me wrong, I love a good popcorn FX extravaganza but I digress, in regards to the House of Wax I have seen far worse and a far better horror films... but I am sure that I will be lured into seeing equally poor ones in the future. If you want to see some inventive death scenes (some farcical) then watch this film... just don't expect to be scared or shocked, its all been done before time and time again.",House of Wax

I think this film was pretty good that's why i gave it a 10, it had me entertained the whole time, and made me jump many times, and was really interesting and realistic, not like other movies, about the actors, they were pretty good, in my opinion, and all those effects made the movie award worth.

395,shayleegreene,worst rip off ever!!!!,1,6 May 2005,I went to see this film already expecting a complete disregard for the real film makers in the business. I was not disappointed in that respect. This film is almost an exact copy of Rob Zombie's absolute flop horror film 'House Of A 1000 Corpses'. Even some of the dialogue is the same. The outcomes of the films are of course different but the idea of the plots are very similar. this film is a complete disappointment for the fans of the actors in it. I would go so far as to saying that they need new agents. When will Hollywood learn that anything starring Paris Hilton is sure to be as horrific and as painful to endure as surgery with no anesthetic. The only film of hers to succeed was the one she made herself. She should learn she has no acting ability and destroys the reputations of actors and film crews of which she is associated with. Don't even wait for the DVD release. It is worse than anything I have ever seen and I'm not just talking about films.,House of Wax
396,Yello_Mit,Probably the best horror film this year.,9,17 May 2005,"I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair). Usually he plays a mean cop or soldier, but he did very well in this.Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also acted very well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie, then Eliza stole it back by enduring a lot of pain in the second half like getting the finger clipped off, ripping her lips apart after they got glued together, and getting a straight forward punch in the face by Bo.Overall, I give this movie an 8/10. Fans of horror films MUST see this.",House of Wax

Do they even care if they make a decent movie? The first hour bored me to tears and it was only in the second hour did anything interesting happen. But, by then it was too little too late. This movie was just a cash grab attempt with no ambition to create a real movie. Ghost Ship was a masterpiece compared to this mess. How clever of them to think of making the town filled with wax figures. Boy, how creative! Way to ""re-imagine"" the film. Anyone could tell that this was going to be crap the minute you saw Paris and her wooden acting abilities. Even though the movie was a free preview screening, I still feel I was robbed of my time. The only way we can get them to stop is to stay away and don't contribute to the box office. Stay away!",House of Wax
398,pw04,A Great Slasher/Horror Film,8,26 April 2005,"My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good. I'm not gonna go into detail for the plot since I'm sure you know about it. Surpirsisngly, the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them, especially Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray's characters. We meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together. Another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and feels almost documentary-like rather than a music video (Don't get me wrong, I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville).Now for the death scenes. In most slasher movies, whenever a character is stabbed or killed, the scene immediately cuts away to another scene,but not in this one. When a character is about to die, they die pretty gruesomely. But the filmmakers don't stop there and add a little something extra each time for each victim. I won't say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourself.While this is a great slasher movies, it does have the flaws of almost all slasher films (exploring a creepy house when you shouldn't be, getting a ride with a suspicious character, splitting up, and screaming so the killer can hear you). Also, there is a kinda stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and didn't add to the film at all. You could tell it was just added in at the last moment and if you took it out, it would not have affected the movie at all.Basically, if you are a horror film fan, see this movie. You will not be disappointed. It's got all that's needed to make it a great slasher film, possibly the best of the year even though it's kinda early. The suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie. If you hate horror films, chances are you may like this one and if you are divided, I encourage you to give it a shot.",House of Wax
399,teamyoth,Disappointment,4,1 June 2005,"Normally I'm the type that shys away from these trendy teen horrors, but I still watched it because a) it was free and b) the sinfully sexy Elisha Cuthbert is in it. The trailer was in fact quite impressive, and had got my hopes up that maybe a GOOD teen slasher would be waiting for me. The film started off as one might expect, introducing the characters and setting up the ""mishap."" Once the killing starts though, you know the film's gone badly wrong. Apparently bones and tendons in this film have the equivalent strength of noodles and severing body parts is as easy as melting butter with a blast furnace. Oh and apparently car windows these days are made of paper. Having said that, the deaths are entertaining and gory enough to keep it interesting and some parts were done brilliantly, the waxing in particular. In conclusion, totally unrealistic (as is expected of Hollywood slashers) and predictable (ditto), however almost saved by some nice touches.",House of Wax
400,jayfull2003,Not too shabby,8,28 April 2005,"Admittedly, before seeing House of Wax, I assumed it would simply be a second tier low quality teen slasher film following in the footsteps of such movies as The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After catching an advanced showing at my college campus, I can honestly say that the people at Dark Castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a slasher. Starting with the usual staples of a teenage horror film such as the small group of friends departing on a road trip, coming across an odd detour taking them through country back-roads, meeting creepy locals, after the slow but mandatory back-story this movie really reaches a fast clip. Paris Hilton appears in this film as many already know, but I really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance. Clearly her acting wasn't worth an Oscar, but the filmmakers use her appearance to its fullest by squeezing two blatant satires of her, let's just say, less noble media appearance into this film. Ms. Hilton also claims the title for the greatest death scene in the movie, and not simply because it was her death scene.This movie is full to the brim with jumpy moments and cheap scares, but Jaume Serra has definitely created quality suspense and tension between the characters. The causes for the horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters, which we do. By making the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and jerked camera some other scary moments. These standard movie techniques adopted from many movies past are almost perfected with this film, and provide many good scares. In fact there isn't a slow moment after they get to the small town where the dreaded House of Wax museum is. This film owes a lot to many previous movies of this and other genres, though I'm not too sure how much came from the original 1953 movie of the same title. References to such movies as both Texas Chainsaw Masacres, Saw, and even Titanic, (see Paris Hilton's big death scene and you'll know what I mean) are common, but in the end the payoff will leave you scared and fulfilled if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs. Not bad.",House of Wax
401,Addyson_Medley_Fan,Better Than I Expected,7,28 May 2005,"CAST: Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Jared Padelecki, Jon Abrahams, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton, Robert RichardPLOT: 6 friends (Cuthbert, Murray, Padelecki, Abrahams, Hilton and Richard) are on a road trip through Texas (Probably) off to see a football game in Blake and Wades cars. The decide to stop and camp out for the night because they were tired. During the night they encounter a truck that stirs at them for a couple of minutes. Then Nick throws a beer bottle at his headlight breaking it. Then the truck goes and drives off. When they wake up they are almost late for the game. Dalton is missing his camcorder and there is something missing from Wades engine that will prevent him from driving. He doesn't want to get into Blakes car because he is afraid that the trucker from last night would come and destroy his car in revenge because Nick messed up his headlight. Wade decides to stay and go into town to find a gas station and get a new thing. Cathy (Wades girlfriend) does not want to leave Wade all alone so she stays with him while the rest of group take Blakes car to see the game. Blake, Paige, Dalton and Nick get ca ult in traffic and they realize that they ain't going anywhere and they are just going to miss the game so they decide to go back to the campsite. What they don't know is that their are a couple of sadistic, psychotic, siblings running around who kidnap innocent people passing through their town and spray liquid wax all over them making them look like wax dummies.GORE/BLOOD: The deaths were awesome! Nearly everybody says the movie sucks but the deaths make it worth watching. If you want to know the deaths go down to the message board and click on ""The Deaths"" and I tell you who dies how they die and the order of the deaths.NUDITY: Sorry guys but there is no nudity. But Paris Hilton does a strip tease but once she takes off her shirt and pants revealing her bra and tight panties, she stops dancing and attempts to tell her boyfriend Blake something. Elisha does take off her shirt because it is dirty but her back is turned toward the camera, and shes wearing a bra, and Dalton is covering her back with his jacket so a creepy guy dumping dead animals doesn't see anything so there is pretty much no reason in mentioning it. but after that she is running around in Chad Michael Murrays tight, sleeveless undershirt for most of the movie YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE Characters: Cathy (Elisha Cuthbert) is the female lead who we are supposed to believe is nice and is a straight A student. She is shy in front of the camera. She is Wades girlfriend, Nicks sister and is best friends with Paige.Nick (Chad Michael Murray) is the male lead in the movie. Besides the killers, he is the only character I didn't like but when he and Dalton went to look for Cathy and Wade I started to like him. He is either to things in the movie: a bad ass or a dick. Besides Dalton, no one really likes him. He is Cathys brother and is best friends with Dalton.Wade (Jared Padelecki) is the nice guy. He goes around not doing anything wrong. He is nice to everyone. He is Cathys boyfriend and if he has a best friend then it is probably Blake.If there's a comic relief in this movie, its Dalton (Jon Abrahams) . He gets the most laughs in the movie (at least from me). While he still has his camcorder, he runs around filming things. He is best friends with Nick.Most slasher flicks have a slutty couple who most of the time make out and stuff. This slasher flick is not really different. The slutty couple in this is Paige (Paris Hilton) and Blake (Robert Richard). We are supposed to believe Paige and Blake have not had sex yet, and I didn't even believe Cathy and Wade didn't have sex yet. Paige is best friends with Cathy and if Blake has a best friend it is probably Wade. Overall I liked all of the characters, they were likable.THE ACTING: The acting is decent, nobody did a bad job, Paris Hilton (The biggest topic on the House of Wax message board) did better then I expected, although she does not get much screen time, she did okay. Elisha Cuthbert usually plays a slutty girl and like in ""The Girl Next Store"" and Chad Michael Murray usually plays the popular guy like in both ""Freaky Friday"" and ""A Cinderella Story"" but both are the opposed in this movie, Elisha plays a nice girl and Chad plays a Jerk/Dick/ Bad Ass. Both do really good. Jared Padelecki from ""Flight of the Pheonix"" does a good job and pulls off the nice guy roll. Robert Richard from ""Coach Carter"" also does a good job. Brian Van Holt is good in both of his rolls as well. Jon Abrsahams should have got a bigger part since hes been in the most movies including ""Scary Movie"", ""Meet The Parents"", 'Boiler Room' and ""My Bosses Daughter"" .FINAL NOTE: The film is not really scary but it might give someone under 10 nightmares.I liked the movie but I don't know if you would, but I recommend it anyway. I hope my comment was useful for you!",House of Wax

The gore was typical of most newer horror films. A few twists and turns set it above other horror films. Good acting held it together well. I'm a fan of 50's b-movies, and at times during this film it had that campy-fun kind of thing going on (in a good way). I liked Chad Murray's role--I thought he played that out well. Elisha Cutbert also did a good job as well as Paris Hilton (whom I've never really been impressed with).

I am glad he did not die or i literally would have cried. The violence of this movie was pretty good to. I think the best death part of the movie is Paris Hilton's death it was of the chain how she died if was so awesome. If you don't think this movie is a 10 you are crazy unless you just don't like horror movie.

406,fraser-40,Note to Cast and crew: read scripts before signing up,3,18 December 2005,"Well what can i say. Firstly I'm very surprised that this film has such a high rating here. I found the whole plot line very flimsy and quite poorly executed. True it may follow the standard horror formula but is that necessarily a good thing? The best films are always the ones that break the rules and do something unexpected or new. This film does none of that. The plot is quite predictable you can pretty much tell in which order the group are going to be picked off, who is going to survive and who isn't. There are also several things which happen which are just ludicrous, that is to say the events in this film could not have gone the way they did in real life, and I'm talking about the interaction of characters not the whole wax aspect. The acting for the most part isn't bad, which slightly surprised me given the cast are made up mostly of unknowns plus Paris Hilton and Elisha Cuthbert.Anyway to sum up, if you want to see it by all means do but if you can wait for it on TV you might be glad you didn't pay.",House of Wax
407,FlipThePrinceCharming,A Guilty Favorite of Mine,7,24 April 2007,"OK, maybe it doesn't deserve an Oscar. Or a Golden Globe. Or any award, for that matter. The acting isn't outstanding, there's no reason to give credits to the directing, and its really just another semi-gory 21st century slasher flick that MOST people will consider just decent. Or maybe even dreadful. But in my opinion, all of this doesn't matter a bit. And thats because i had a great time watching this movie.Sure, the first 40 minutes are pretty slow, but as the movie progresses, something in it you will like, if you are like I was, and anybody else should be when watching this movie. And that is: looking for 2 hours of fun, mindless violence. (And a kick-ass ending, which i won't spoil.) Yes, there are many flaws in this movie, but don't let the cast list on the front cover fool you. Hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming. Even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a strip-tease that wasn't as nasty as anything an online pop-up would promise of her, but still not so unbearable as to fast-forward or turn off the DVD.The violence in this surprised me; nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about ""these new movies called 'Saw' and 'Hostel'"" but I could safely say that ""Wax"" was more graphic than Saw, and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing.In conclusion, I'm not surprised House of Wax didn't make a place on the IMDb Top 250, but it is definitely worth a look.",House of Wax

It may not be a perfect horror flick, but it got me really absorbed in it for the entire hour and a half. Some scenes may have been too predictable as with most other horror films (i.e. we can tell that the culprit is showing up again after a silent moment of disappearance), but that did not really ruin my experience, and overall, it was still a great ride. Additionally, Brian Van Holt was phenomenal. He was believable and literally sent shivers up my spine. Chad Michael Murray and Elisha Cuthbert were great, too, and Paris Hilton waswellgreatly amusing. I, however, don't see Hilton's acting as destructive to the entire movie. I'd still encourage horror movie fans to see it for what it's worth.",House of Wax
410,Ron Noon,"big budget, bad editing, little tiny bang",4,4 August 2006,"if it were supposed to be an homage to the original, well, it fails.Too many scenes that drag on . . . quiet, sudden threat, endless running. Music is oddly comedic, much overdone and slapped on. Jeepers Creepers is an example of well done, this is the example of badly done. Gore is not horror. Running is not terror. Effort is not worth, these folks think that if they put their all into the film they create something worthwhile, but if they are lacking in depth, all they achieve is taking up time. Think of Halloween . . . there was a movie with music that fit. Of course as a worthy little bit you do get to see someone push a huge pipe through Paris Hilton's head.",House of Wax

The only ""good"" thing I can think of is it sure makes an impression. Only see it if you enjoy the ""teenager-bad-taste"" kind of horror.Even the actors are bad, but then again, who would like to be in this movie? Paris Hilton sure CAN'T act but I'm sure some people like to see her anyway.What makes me give such a low rate on this movie is the way it uses delicate issues like violence against children or pregnancy in such a shocking way.",House of Wax

It is written very well and everything makes complete sense!I advise all to see this movie. It is not to dirty for kids, and it is not to boring and fake for adults. House of Wax really explains what the movie is about. A group of kids going to a football game take a shortcut and wind up where no one goes except Bo and Vincent! The house of Wax was very realistic. None of it would be hard to believe if it were to happen in real life. Chad Michael Murray did the best acting in the movie. His attitude really changed at the end.

While in this town in search for a new fan belt, they come across some disturbing things, from the House of Wax to the killing and waxing of people to the Siamese twin brothers. Many weird things are being discovered in this horror film. I find this movie very mind breaking, in this way I mean that you have yourself wondering why was Vincent killing all these people and waxing them. Was it for no reason at all? or was it some hobby that he had continued for his mother? Another thing is when Carly and Wade came upon this town called, Ambrose, they had no thinking methods example: How come there are cars and you don't see anyone, not one person on the road or anywhere?, There's a pet store and you see ""living"" animals but see no one in that store?.

Or seeing the terrified look on PAIGE'S face as a pole crashes through her head penetrating her skull. (Eew!) Although this movie is my FAVORITE, the more you see it, the more you realize it is JUST like The Hills Have Eyes. Here are a list of similarities. 1.)There are a brother and a sister that survive. 2.)There are two killers that are brothers. 3.)Killer(s) has/have a distorted face. 4.)A strange man leads them to the scene where they die. 5.)There are cars that are both extremely important to the plot. (Hills Have Eyes-They hide in the camper/truck. House of Wax-Paris hides in the car in the factory.) Through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the street, this is a REALLY formula tic movie and for those of you who DON'T like Chad Michael Murray, Brian van Holt or DO like Paris, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

The film manages to build up a dark palpable tension and has a creepy Gothic atmosphere; unexceptional - though interesting - protagonists and a fine (award worthy) psychotic performance by Brian Van Holt.For a modestly budgeted horror film, H.O.W. is technically excellent in all departments. Although gory in sporadic bursts; it is the undercurrent of sadistic violence; it's threat of what might or can happen, that lifts this film out of your typical run of the mill slasher flicks.In my personal opinion, the best horror film of the noughties so far!

While it had all the blood and gore you could ask for, it was also clever and had me holding my breath in suspense at several points. What I particularly enjoyed was Elisha Cuthbert's character. Finally, a young woman who shows some guts (major guts), uses her wits rather than making one stupid move after the other, and she makes a great team with Chad Michael Murray's character. I think the two of them make the film. The special effects were awesome and contributed to the plot in very clever ways. I haven't seen this entertaining a horror movie in a long time.",House of Wax

I found the opening few minutes involving the two villains when they were young, quite distressing to watch, which did surprise me.The special effects were very impressive, and were suitably gory enough to send a chill down your spine. This movie definitely plays on the notion of wax figures being somewhat creepy, and takes full advantage of it. The scene where one character discovers another fully waxed up, his tear-filled eyes still moving, and attempting to save him, is a highlight.Paris Hilton, the only real major 'star' name to this movie, acts to the best of her ability. Make of that what you will. She does provide one of the major highlights to the movie.I did enjoy the ending, although the so-called twist at the end was a bit of a let down.A great Friday night movie!",House of Wax
423,N03113,Without a Leg to Stand on...,1,13 May 2005,"Having little to nothing to do with the original film, House of Wax (1953), this film hasn't but one leg to stand on. GOREThe only element that the movie depends on is gore. How much bloodshed can we show in the movie theater without the movie being thrown out of production. While it's understood that most horror films have an element of blood and gore as well is nonsensical violence, House of Wax went far and beyond disgusting.Not even the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), which was about body limbs being severed by a chainsaw wielding maniac, could showcase as much gore as House of Wax.Beyond the fact that this film was purely intended to exploit the special effects and gore featured in it, it ranks a next to nothing in any other category of film greatness. The acting in this film lacks dimension. There is no sense of urgency other than the fabricated lie of special effects and gore; there is no strong actions which lead to objectives that would give any of the character's depth.The only goodness that comes out of the film is the death of Paris Hilton's character. (The death of anyone in this film lacks surprise as the film lacks originality.) Sure to be a cult classic for the few sick tormented serial killers out there who want to cover their victims in wax... this film's for you.Whatever happen to the classic design of Horror?",House of Wax
424,perfectseanie,Okay popcorn movie,6,10 May 2005,"Not the worst teen slasher flick you could see but this one needed another couple passes on the script. These are some of the flattest teens since Wrong Turn to be hunted by savage rednecks. Still, Paris Hilton makes the rest of the cast look like Oscar contenders and the producers wisely cut around her dialog. I bust out laughing during her ""big scene"" that she made such a big deal about on the MTV behind-the-scenes ""reality"" show. But just when you're looking at your watch and wondering if you can get your tickets exchanged for passes to see the new Amityville down the hall the mayhem starts. This is one of those films, like the remake of 13 Ghosts and the sequel to Final Destination, that shows just how utterly arbitrary the MPAA is at handing out an R versus sending a film back to the cutting room. Stick it out and you will be treated to madmen who kill like they mean it, with a frankness and directness that is as disturbing as the ways in which they dispatch and maim their victims. It's a sub par film compared to the average '80s teen slasher but only during the bits between the killing. No subtext. No allegory. No nudity. Lots of carnage.",House of Wax
425,random_raven,House of Wax = House of Pants!,1,3 June 2005,"There are not many film trailers that truly make my skin crawl, but I have to admit, the House of Wax trailer both terrified and intrigued me. I settled into my seat at the cinema, with my friends, all poised with our jackets at the ready, expecting to find my worse nightmare unfold before me on the screen: horrible wax works coming to life and trying to kill people (corny I know but that's just me!). However, I was frightfully disappointed to be watching a typical, road-trip, slasher flick of the ""my car broke down so I'm forced to go into this creepy, deserted town"" variety, where psychos NOT creepy moving wax works are doing the killing. Whilst the gore was gory and the blood was bloody, I find, and I'm sure I'm not the only one, that what you don't see is far more chilling than what you do. A finger being chopped off or someone being decapitated is not scary and it certainly isn't anything movie goers haven't seen a million times before. Encumbered throughout by Luke-warm acting, the story is mind bogglingly predictable and comes with the inevitable American schmaltzy, ""Aaw gee"" ending (even though the only two left standing are brother and sister!!). Might I also add, the terrible attempt at a cliff hanger, when you clumsily find out that there were THREE Sinclair children not TWO, (despite how incongruous that is with the beginning of the movie!!) with the creepy roadkill man being the third brother. Although the idea for this film could have been turned into a real spooky little gem, the cliché ""teen gore fest"" genre was not a wise choice. As I said before, subtle scares and leaving the killing to the imagination of the viewer, is a much better tactic for inciting terror than simply bathing the audience in blood.However, despite the fact I only stayed in the cinema so as to not completely waste my money, I was kept awake by the brilliant music. In fact, the music (along with Paris Hilton's terrifying strip-tease!!!) was the scariest aspect of the film. It was proper horror movie music that, had I just been listening to that, would have scared me. All in all I don't believe this film even deserves a rating of 1 and I have only given it that rating because it won't let you use minus numbers! House of Wax = House of Pants!!!",House of Wax
426,Stacers,Worth 8 bucks to see Paris die,7,8 May 2005,"To be honest, I think this movie was quite enjoyable. My favorite movies are scary movies. Any kind really...horror, thriller, supernatural...anything basically just spooky. I also love dramas...Lord of the Rings is my favorite and look at how well it did! I mean, just keep in mind when seeing this that it won't be an Oscar contender...but since when are horror movies? If you go in for some gore, a few laughs and some scares, then this movie is for you. The acting could be better but after seeing Wes Craven's ""They"", any acting is at least tolerable. And seeing Chad Michael Murray shirtless *wooooo*, no complaints there. I think this was a nice scary movie..it mixed the right amount of suspense, blood and gore, the cheesy lines, a few laughs, and of course...horny teenagers. What more could scary movie go-ers ask for? Basically, just lighten up and take it for what it's worth, which is a pretty OK scary movie.",House of Wax

In my opinion there is really nothing wrong with this because it allows the new generation to add all the special effects and gore that couldn't be added way back when. If you go see horror movies you don't exactly go for the awesome plot lines. I thought House of Wax was a commendable remake and I would recommend it to any horror loving movie goer. This was the first time in awhile that I actually recognized the villain from something else. I like that... I like when I know of the actor playing the villain.

I could not have been more wrong.What starts off as a typical horror movie story about a group of teenagers on a road trip who happen to stumble upon a town grows into an exciting and somewhat different scary film which, although firmly planted in the teen horror genre, stands out from other films such as scream and i know what you did last summer.There is plenty of eye candy for both boys and girls (chad Micheal murray with his top off...does not disappoint!) but the main focus on the characters in the film seemed to be a refreshing break from normal horror movies, with nobody dying until nearly halfway through the movie. The relationships between the characters are believable and surprisingly well acted, even Paris Hilton does an OK job, although it is particularly satisfying when she dies. The killers, both played by Brian Van Holt are creepy and jump out on you at just the right moments, and the gore is fairly tame for a slasher movie, with the most gruesome scenes over quickly.All in all this film hits the right buttons for a film of its genre, adding originality to create a film which is scary, jumpy, and interesting. It's one of my favourite films. I recommend it!",House of Wax
429,darryl-palmer,Nothing Original here,4,31 March 2012,"Maybe I'm just getting jaded, but there is just nothing or creative here. Sure the ideas or whatever are kind of unique, but it still has the usual bits and pieces of a typical Hollywood teen slasher. It has the stupid characters, the blood and gore, a killer, cheap scares and a intense ending.I was dreading seeing this because of Paris Hilton. She wasn't as bad as expected. I never intended to see this but i am a big fan of Jared Padalecki because i watch and love Supernatural so i watched it. I never expected to like this but i was surprised at how much i did. I expected to give this a 1/10.Overall House of Wax is somewhat watchable thanks to its high level of gore, decent acting and intense ending that pays off with a twist. I loved when My Chemical Romance blasted into my ears with Helena in the end credits. I recommend this if you like teen horror movies that are not for wimpy teens like Prom Night.

430,CarolAE716,Very Entertaining!,9,4 May 2005,"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch. Viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be satisfied here, but there are other ghoulish effects as well. The production design and sets are excellent, and the cast makes the most of their under-written roles.Of course, many people are probably wondering just how Paris Hilton's performance is. To be honest, Hilton acquits herself quite well, and she doesn't portray ""herself,"" as so many people are predicting. Her character is sexy and sweet, and I think her good work will hopefully change a lot of people's opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, moving up from her previous movie, the atrocious ""The Girl Next Door."" Her character is put through a lot, and Cuthbert proves to be a feisty heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is pretty to look at, but unfortunately is not very convincing as the ""bad boy"" of the group.I predict good things for ""House Of Wax,"" as the audience at the screening I attended hollered, screamed and clapped through out many parts of the movie.

There were some satisfying death scenes in the movie, but by far the most satisfying was the death of Paris Hilton. She was killed by the Vincent character when he threw a lead pipe through her forehead. Then he recorded her death with the camera he had stolen earlier.

It's a typical slasher flick as far as the premise goes, but it is quite above average. Some of the kills are very cool, the action is exciting, the suspense is great, and the humor towards the beginning isn't too shabby for a horror movie. The only problem is that the movie doesn't feel very confident in itself towards the start, if you catch my drift. The opening scene is great/frightening, but for the next twenty or so minutes after that, it doesn't feel like a horror movie. It feels like a teen comedy movie without the required amount of jokes. But once the first body hits the floor, the disturbing gore and turning into the wrong corner don't end until the end. The two main characters are very good at playing their part. Really my only beef is the twist ending, because(and you'll know what I mean once you see it) the filmmakers don't really go anywhere interesting with it.All in all, a good film with a lot of gore that no one likes because Paris Hilton is in it.",House of Wax
436,jimmyneo1,Not too bad at all,7,2 March 2006,"Although not strictly a remake, House of Wax is the latest in the recent trend of Hollywood plundering old horror titles and repackaging them for a new younger audience. The story is as formulaic as you'd expect, six good looking young people go on a road trip for a big college football game, only to become stranded in a forest by nightfall. The next morning they find that their car has broken down/been sabotaged so searching for help this brings them to an isolated town that is home to the roadside attraction, the House of Wax. Here they meet a strange yet friendly local called Bo (Brian Van Holt) who is hiding a sinister secret and well you can probably guess the rest.The group is led by Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) her bad boy twin brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray) their friend Paige (Paris Hilton), the rest of the friends are all fairly one dimensional and therefore doomed. As the teens try to get help in the town they soon discover that it has long been deserted and is now being run by the sadistic Bo and his deformed twin brother Vincent who have been immortalizing their victims as wax sculptures all over the town. Each teen is killed in a more brutal way until it is only Carly and Nick left to face off against Bo and Vincent.I'll admit I went into this one with very low expectations; it has Paris Hilton in it for God's sake. But I was pleasantly surprised, Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray both work hard with the material their given, which isn't much but both are convincing in their roles. Elisha Cuthbert gives a good Sigourney Weaver/ Jamie Lee Curtis heroine performance and Murray is good as the brooding bad boy. Fortunately for the film Paris Hilton is only a minor character in the films plot, she's kept away from the action most of the time and only pops up to make a few in jokes about her infamous sex tape and then to meet her demise.The film does have its faults though; it's very slow starting and tries desperately to create backstorys about characters you don't care too much for. In fact it's almost a third into the movie before a murder happens. Also the ending with twins versus twins seemed to be trying to be something more profound. The fact that the screenwriters are twins may be a clue, but I have a twin brother myself and I couldn't work it out.Serra, a first time film director does do a nice job though, especially with making the murders extremely graphic and inventive. There are no simple splatters of blood but more horrific incidents such as having your achilles tendon cut, skin peeled off and fingers chopped off. All these are done in close up with cringe inducing sound affects that will delight any horror fan. The special effects in the last twenty minutes as the House of Wax begins to burn are also very impressive and show clear influences from producer Robert Zemeckis.If your a big fan of Horror films you'll love this, if not just leave your brain at the door and enjoy yourself.",House of Wax

The real horror in this movie lies entirely to set design, make-up and gory effects. If you like the sight of blood, you will enjoy this movie. It was a lot gorier then I actually though it would be. The story holds on its own as well, like I said I haven't seen the original so I don't know how much was altered for a new generation of kids but it was done well.

But soon, after Wade disappears into Bo's house, and attacks Carly, Nick realizes something terrible has happened, and no one will be meeting them at the road.Taking heroic action, Nick and his friend set off into Ambrose to9 find Carly and Wade, while Paige (Hilton) and her boyfriend stay behind for a little fun.**Note, rules of a horror film, have sex, you die.As usual, the creepy high music tones, enormous amounts of gore, and long chase scenes set in.

After being assured that they were never there, the trapped Carly attempts to get Nick's attention by sticking her finger through a grate in the ground. Most situations with this same feel, do not end in a very nice fashion.Finally we get to an action packed finale, where the film slightly falls apart (no pun intended), but it's able to hold its ground, and come out as one of the best slasher flicks I've seen in a while.Definitely no Oscars, but it was one fun ride So after what seemed like a short (due to fast paced action), but was a really long movie, I was actually pleased.Definitely no Oscars, but it was one fun ride.8/10",House of Wax
440,QPMorris,I Was Pleasantly Surprised,9,30 May 2005,"I went in to the movies on Friday and saw House of Wax. I expected it to be a mindless slash fest, but I was actually very satisfied with it. Let me tell you why. Most modern horror movies are formulaic, and while Wax was based on an old movie, it really impressed me. The two leads ( Cuthbert and Murray) are thoroughly likable, and thank God that Paris Hilton was not given much use- except as a corpse. Even though it doesn't beat the 1953 classic, it's still my kind of horror movie. It's actually moody and atmospheric, with something of an impending sense of doom. It was at least better than the Ring 2, Boogeyman, or Amityville-personal opinion. While not my favorite horror flick of the past few years ( my favorite is Sleepy Hollow), I'll still buy the DVD when it comes out. By the way, it's worth your money just to see Paris get killed.",House of Wax

WTF? have you never seen a film before? Almost EVERYTHING in this film is predictable. I figured out well before the end that the 2 psychos chasing after them were the brothers viewed in the opening scenes of the film. There's nothing fresh about this film. Nothing AMAZING. 3-5 shock scares and thats about it. There's nothing scary about a moron running after people with 2 knives. Not in this day and age.My $1.50 cents.",House of Wax
442,jay-mann-1,horrible movie !!!,1,7 December 2005,Don't see this movie it is so stupid and makes no sense. The only good part is when Paris Hilton get's a stake thrown in her head. This movie is just plain boring.I thought sense it's rated R maybe it would be good but I was so wrong. I would even get a 1 I think I would give a one half over ten. This will probably be the last movie I see with Paris Hilton in it. Besides that the story line was so dull. The funny thing was that the movie was based in Florida and some scenes had mountains in it. Most of Florida is mostly flat land. It makes me want to barf each time I watch it.I believe if they took there time to have a better story line and better actor's the movie would be so much better.,House of Wax
443,KaraDawn,"Overall, a satisfying movie",7,10 May 2005,"I was quite excited to go see the movie especially having followed it in the ""Movie Life"" done by MTV. Although I will admit that had Elisha Cuthbert not been in it, I would have waited until it comes out on video and would actually probably recommend that for anyone who is careful about what they spend their money on. I will say though that I didn't have extremely HIGH expectations for the movie from a horror film perspective, so this may be the reason that I wasn't disappointed after watching it. I had my share of jumps and ""grossed out"" moments, but I didn't leave the theater terrified or anything. Overall, I was glad I saw it. Elisha did an awesome job and I will continue to support movies that she is in. And, I'm not a Paris Hilton fan by any stretch of the imagination, but she really did OK (not great, but OK) and her role in the film isn't so overwhelming that if you do not like her it should keep you from seeing it. In fact, you will probably be joined, as I was, with cheers and shouts when she bites it =) The other actors were fine...Jared and Chad were good casts for their roles. I gave the movie a 7 because I was satisfied...it even slightly exceeded my expectations. I recommend seeing it if you go into it with the right attitude and perspective and can truly appreciate the hard work that the actors/actresses/crew members put into making it. If not, I still recommend seeing it, but you may want to wait to pay the 8.50 to 10 bucks and rent it =) You'll be less bitter if you don't like it.",House of Wax
444,Blu_Eyez,House of Wax 2005 Review: a Cool and Intense Thriller,10,11 June 2005,"I recently saw House of Wax and must say i really enjoyed it.it's been one of the better Horror/Thriller films in the past few years, if not one of the best and most entertaining.i've heard a lot of people bashing the so-called slow start and character development which takes up the Films opening 45 minutes.yet if the film dived straight into the deaths, audiences and critics would have criticised the film for not having decent characters who they couldn't care less about.well as for the character development, i think it worked amazingly well.taking into my own response and others (from reading posts off the message board), a lot of people ended up wanting the characters to live, one of which i've noticed many people mentioning being Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). taking into consideration Warner. Bros. have been marketing her death, its a surprise turn around that many audiences ended up cheering her on for survival.speaking of the chase/death scenes, they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful i've witnessed in a while, and enjoyed each one very much.the acting in the film was absolutely fine, i couldn't fault any of them, especially Paris Hilton, i thought she was very decent and i was hoping for her the get more than a mere 25 minutes screen time in a 120 minute film, yet her chase scene made up for that, and believe me when i say Paris can act scared, (Watch the scene where she's hiding in a car from Vincent and he walks past her .... the look of terror on her face comes across as VERY real).Overall i give House of Wax maximum stars, for entertainment value and suspense and even gore ...... only criticism is i wish that during the marketing for the film, they hadn't revealed the death list and who dies and who survives, as it would have been ten times better not knowing if the character being chased was going to live or die and horrible death.can't wait for the DVD, but go see it at the Cinema while you can, it won't be the same in your own front room, yet if you do wait for the DVD, watch the film in the dark with no interruptions, trust me you wont be disappointed.",House of Wax

This film would have been much better if they had taken Paris (AKA, Skank) Hilton's death scene and run it in a continuous loop! What's even worse is that it wastes the genuine talents of Elisha Cuthbert, giving her a thankless role (don't be so quick to put this on your resumé). You know a film sucks when you're rooting for the villain.Oooh, and that big twist at the end! The titular House of Wax . . . is actually made of wax! Who was the Ricky Retardo who thought that one up? I gave this hunk o' junk 1/10 because I couldn't go any lower than that. This waste of film would be a natural for MST3K.",House of Wax

True, this film will not win any awards and it isn't a masterpiece by any means. But for true horror fans, its a thrill ride with some very interesting special effects. The beginning was a little slow, but the remainder of the film more then made up for it. After seeing such absurd horror films as Boogeyman and Cabin Fever, this was truly a treat. I actually took my mom for Mother's Day to see it, and since she is also a horror buff, she really enjoyed it too...although she said...it was the bloodiest film she's ever seen...she says that about every horror film. This is a good film, that you can just enjoy without giving the plot or characters much thought. Its a fun film!",House of Wax

448,jmrodkey,House of Crap,1,22 May 2005,"This dreadful film is not a remake of HOUSE OF WAX but another rehashing of every teen themed Horror flick to come out of the over produced Hollywood Horror meat machine. None of the characters in this film are particularly likable so you don't really care about them and in the end I just wished that they had all died in a horrible car accident in the beginning of the film so I wouldn't have had to sit through the rest of this mess. Hollywood needs to get the message, that Blair With hand held camcorder effect isn't art, it's irritating. Hollywood also needs to get the message that more than kids watch these movies so lay of the rock scores that exist of irritating noises and not music. The success of the original 80's slasher films had as much to do with the effective scoring of the films that burned themselves into our memory. Everybody knows those themes because the music still haunts them.I keep reading these reviews that say the Vincent Price movie was a camp horror film. That's news to me. The Vincent Price film was also a remake, but it was not camp. It was a horror film and when seen in it's time it was quite shocking. Everything about this film is cookie cutter formula, nothing is shocking because it's all too predictable. The trend today seems to be to take older films and run them through the formula grinder and come out with something totally different, not related to the original in any way.If the original film worked, it worked for a reason. If people are still watching the original versions of these films then they still work today. Why tamper with something that works. Perhaps it's because, they too, see the Vincent Price film as camp and if that's the case, they really have no clue what a horror film is in the first place.",House of Wax

Keeps you on you toes, and also some pretty gruesome scenes. Can't wait tell this movie comes out on DVD. I'm not a big fan of Paris Hilton, but she really does a good job in this movie. I thought she would be kind of not so serious, but she did a awesome job. also all the other actors are great, good acting and didn't think there was a bad scene in the movie. I would recommend going to see this flick, chad Micheal Murray was a bad ass, didn't take crap from anyone. If your going to see this make sure you take someone with you.",House of Wax

The characters walking into peoples houses and looking around without permission is the silliest thing I've seen. Paris Hilton was actually OK but Elisha Cuthbert was terribly underused in her role. I had to restrain myself from going back to the kiosk and asking for a refund. From the very beginning i was continually asking myself why the characters were acting the way they were acting and couldn't come up with any real answer. This is the sort of movie that compares so badly to superb Japanese horror films of which Hollywood keeps remaking. Come on Hollywood, come up with something better than this mess.",House of Wax
451,charmedroxmysox215,I loved this movie.........,10,28 May 2005,This movie was so awesome. I enjoyed everything about it especially the way it sort of waited before jumping in to the slicing and dicing of the poor victims and yes Paris Hilton also. Any person who is purposely watching this film to see her die will be very satisfied as her pipe through the head death is further explored with Vincent (The killer) twisting the pull while its inside her head and then ripping it out. I loved this movie and the awesome wax figures and wax village of people this movie is very symbolic especially when Vincent cuts through the wax door and splits the conjoined twins apart and when both killers die and Vincent falls on top of his brother as they were born. I recommend it to all!!!,House of Wax
452,samwellgc,Very jumpy with no 'aftershocks',7,19 June 2005,"The first thing I noticed about this film was the quality of Paris Hilton's acting. She was a much better actress than I predicted, very life-like, late-teen-early-20's acting. Also, I walked into this film and expected it to be just another lame, predictable horror film, but it wasn't all that bad. Okay to be fair some bits were too predictable, but nevertheless it wasn't a 90's/10's horror replica. I think the plot was quite clever too, and there were no 'plot-holes', no contradictions of the film. Though I was disappointed at the end of the film, when the whole house melts. Looked quite silly. Anyway, I give it a 6/7, not a revolutionary film but it was OK.",House of Wax

So House Of Wax was always going to be a hit with me, but just because of that love for this type of horror doesn't mean i can't tell a good movie from a bad one. This film has bits of both, some good acting from it's lead stars Elisha Cuthert, Chad Michael Murray and in fairness Miss Hilton doesn't do badly, in fact her character is exactly how you might imagine her in real life! Some nicely perfected Death scenes are in line for characters of Wade (Jared Padalecki) and Paige(Paris), although you'll be screaming at the t.v for most of the time! Contribute in making this cleverly directed film even better. Some interesting little plots put you in the minds of the helpless kids as one by one they are lured into one big trap constructed by The two brothers making ""the wax figures look so realistic"". Brian Van Holt is superb as Bo' i can't imagine anyone else playing him. Overall a fun movie, with twists,turns and screams along the way. Worth a Watch Joe Szwed",House of Wax
454,sjp1966,House of Wax,7,4 April 2007,"I had been avoiding this film mainly due to Paris Hilton being in it and i figured (quite incorrectly) that the film would suffer because of it.However after watching it i think that it is certainly well above average for a horror film. We don't leap directly into the action and although the character development is not the deepest you will see, time is taken for us to find out a little more about the characters, which give the film some good credit.The Horror portion of the film for the most part is done very well with some nice scares and moments of tension sprinkled throughout. There are moments when we are asked to suspend out belief a little too far however when things seem a little too ridiculous but those few points aside i think that anyone that is a fan of the Horror genre will enjoy watching this one.",House of Wax

456,sunshinex2009,Not what I expected,10,22 October 2005,"I have to admit, I was quite pleased with this movie. Although the beginning was a bit cliché, as far as the characters go. But as the movie progressed their characters fit. Chad Michael Murray is really a good guy underneath that intimidating outside. Elisha Cuthbert plays sweet Carly Jones his twin sister desperate to fix her brothers problems. For the short role he has Jared Padalecki plays Wade, Carly's curious boyfriend, who convinces her to enter the deserted House Of Wax. Dalton Chapman, played by Jon Abrahams is colorful and miscevious character. Robert Ri'chard (who you may remember from Cousin Skeeter?) plays Blake, Paige's boyfriend who planned the trip in order to go to a very important football game. Which brings us to Paris Hilton who does a surprisingly convincing Paige Edwards, as I myself am not a fan of her. The group travels to the Baton Rouge area (actually filmed in Australia)to see the football game but are not able to get in and get sidetracked to a town they can't find on their map. Upon hearing the story of the two brothers Bo and Vincent (both are played by Brian Van Holt), lets just say many characters don't make it. If your a horror fan you would really enjoy this movie, the torture and endless gory scenes are plentiful. If you do decide to see this film, watch it until the end, because there is a twist that might surprise you, but was quite evident.",House of Wax
457,hutupsay,"A hide and go seek movie, but a good one",8,22 August 2005,"The main reason i went to go see the movie was because of all the well known actors, so the fact that the movie was actually good really satisfied my night.In the first thirty minutes or so, although nothing suspenseful happens, we do get a rather clear view of what the characters are like and several comical moments.When the movie eventually got going, i was clinging on to my seat, scrunching my face up at gory bits and yelling commands at the characters when they weren't doing something that was blatantly the correct thing to do. Although i may have cringed during some of the really bloody bits, i still enjoyed watching them and thought that the effects and make-up were very well done, especially the special effects in the last scene.Memories of the movie, ""House of 1000 corpses"" flashed in my head as i watched ""The House of Wax"", for the concept was fairly similar however ""House of 1000 corpses"" was more serious and shocking.This movie was also a hide and go seek movie. The victims always went and hid, the killer crept around and then BOO! He/she finds them and chases them for a bit until the victim hides again, waiting for the killer to find him/her. This can sometimes get irritating.I liked the fact that when a main character acknowledged the death of another, they reacted strongly to it and did not just forget about it in the next two minutes of the movie unlike some other horror films. All in all the movie has squirmy, jumpy, funny, scary and suspenseful moments topped with good acting, make-up and special effects that made it worth while to watch, for me at least.",House of Wax

You could even tell that she is an actress although the video footage dangerously reminds of her publicly known internet appearances.Credible plot on the ever working structure of one-two killings at a time with the only ""but"" of too ""teenager"" attitude shown by the characters.I would say it is worth having the DVD but not sure if going to the movies would really pay back",House of Wax

The acting was atrocious, the dialog was, at best, awkward, and the direction was sheer crap. I think the screen writer took the title a little too seriously when he decided that the house should actually be constructed out of wax. Utterly ridiculous! Don't even get me started on the structural impossibilities of that! Paris Hilton reportedly stated that the reason her version of House of Wax was better than Vincent Price's, was because she was so much cuter than him. What a complete idiot. Please don't waste your time seeing this movie. Spend the 1.5+ hours doing something useful, like making a birdhouse or mowing a lawn. I don't know, just do ANYTHING else!

Paris Hilton surprised me I have to say because she really played the part well. I would have liked to have seen another female character in the main cast but this did not ruin the movie at all.

Next reason I really didn't like this movie is because Jared Padalecki was killed and I personally love his show Supernatural and I think he is really hot ( as is Jensen Ackles).

The last time I really enjoyed teen slaughter movie was Urban Legends (I don't consider Texas Chainsaw Mascare as teen slaughter - it is based on a true event) House of Wax did a great job on being unique and different. Interesting cast, though they all doesn't really mesh together well in the movie... but however it is unnecessary to put an extra effort in meshing the characters together if they all are gonna split later in the movies.Paris got her chance to make fun of herself. Love it!This movie is definitely a teen slaughter but with some reality in it like Texas Chainsaw Mascare.I am a bit disappointed that the Dark Castle production didn't improve much this time. They have been doing a great job improving since their first movie House on the Haunted Hill.

But I must say that wax is creepy.And I must say I always look an IMDb to check the ratings but I don't think horrors are rated fairly. Offcourse you don't expect great character build and things to ponder on. No its about scaring people and if that works and you want to yell to the main actress WATCH OUT. The movie is a success. So make up your own mind and don't let as help you because you really can't rate a horror movie like you rate others.Thats why this movie gets a 7 even of Paris hilton can't act. Because I jumped up a couple of times and had that eerie feeling and the most characters are like able and that's important for a horror.,House of Wax

From the twist (that we all saw coming, don't lie to yourself), to the unlikeable characters , and even to Paris Hilton herself! This film is the perfect amalgamation of a teenage Friday night date in 2005. The few things that make this movie bearable is the gore, set design, and Brian Van Holt's performance. House of Wax takes it self too seriously with the forced symbolism and could really benefit from self-awareness. But the biggest fault of the movie is the wretched script. The cast is filled with promising actors and actresses (yes, Paris could've benefited from a better script) but their performances suffered due to the writing. Chad Michael Murrays character could've been more interesting if it wasn't for the one dimensional ""bad boy"" type.

I have to say that even if the cut version was shown here in the Philippines, it was still freaking scary! There are even times when I just had to close my eyes and cover my ears because I just couldn't take what's happening anymore. I was telling my friends, ""Man! I wanna get out of here. My heart's about to burst!"" Maybe I'm just overacting because I'm really not used to watching this kind of stuff, but, MAN! It's really is hold-on-to-your-seats-and-pray-that-you-won't-get-a-heart-attack scary!I was disappointed when Jared Padalecki (Wade) got killed off first. Since he's one of the reasons why I watched the movie, I was expecting that I'd get to see more of him... Well, at least he still looks good when he got ""waxed"".I think Chad Michael Murray (Nick) did a great job playing a ""bad boy"" in the movie. I remember the first time I saw him on TV was when he played ""Charlie"" in Dawson's Creek. But then, playing ""Lucas"" in One Tree Hill overshadowed his ""dark side"" so seeing him play ""Nick"" is something different. You just have to block the thought that he plays such a sweet and nice guy in OTH.As for Paris Hilton's (Paige) performance, well, I'm sorry but I think it's flat. Her character is typically her. I didn't feel like she didn't need to act. Maybe that's why she didn't need to audition for the part. I really think the movie would still be good even she's not in it... Well, the viewers need a little bit of laughter amidst all the violence so maybe it's not so bad to see her in the movie... because she dies!Overall, the movie is a must-see. Even if I don't have much background on horror/suspense movies, I really think that if you want something that would get your heart pumping, then this is the movie to see.",House of Wax

I searched House of Wax on a search engine and was appalled at some of the comments left about this horror remake. Not only was it mentioning the fact Paris Hilton was in it and that that ""spoiled it"", but the whole concept of the movie was said to be utter rubbish, which I totally disagree. I have only seen the movie roughly 4 times, and the first was a few weeks ago when it premiered on the Sky Movie Channels. After only seeing it that many times, it is already on my top 10 movies list. I would definitely recommend this movie to those of you who love horror movies, and it is really worth the chance.",House of Wax

They make out camp and shortly after arriving, a mysterious truck appears with a man driving it and he doesn't respond when they ask him to turn his lights off. Nick knocks out one of the headlights with a bottle and the truck driver leaves. The next morning, Wade's truck breaks down by it's fan belt breaking so they find a way to repair it.A truck driver appears and offers to give Wade and Carly a lift to the nearest town, Ambrose. They get there and explore the town to find a ""House Of Wax"" made literally of wax and with wax figures inside all signed ""Vincent"". A man who lives in Ambrose, Bo Sinclair (Brian Van Holt) offers a new fan belt to Wade for his truck and they start to discover that there is something strange about the town. The others were trying to get to the football game but had to come back because of traffic.Wade goes to the bathroom in Bo's house and is taken away by a masked man and make into a wax figure. Carly discovers that Bo was the truck driver who came to their campsite and is captured by Bo. Nick and Dalton go into Ambrose and Blake and Paige stay in the campsite. Nick finds that Bo is evil and rescues Carly. They set out to find everyone else but they are all killed by the masked man who is actually Bo's brother, Vincent, who made all the wax figures. Carly and Nick go through some close calls with the Sinclair brothers, discovers some secrets and fight to survive the wax horror in Ambrose.This movie is a good way to get the thrills and chills you want, especially during Halloween.",House of Wax
472,alexdw-1,Worst Movie of the Year,1,19 June 2006,"Director ""Jaume"", who's previous work includes, get this: music videos, makes his film debut with a remake horror flick. This was by far the worst movie to come out this year. I couldn't find a worse film in 2005... and I tried. The acting was horrible, the script hackneyed, and the production was laughably bad. There was total lack of surprise around every corner, and the special effects would have been more appropriate in an actual 1950s horror film, rather than in an 21st century remake.The plot involves two serial-killing brothers who turn people into wax statues. Apparently, no one noticed that the entire population of the town had been killed and turned into wax. In typical Warner Brothers fashion, House of Wax delivers an uncomfortable production that makes for great previews, but utterly garbage films.It is no surprise that this movie turned out as bad as it did, with an inexperienced director, former Baywatch writer Chad Hayes, and actors like Chad Michael Murray (Undressed, Freaky Friday) and Paris Hilton (LA Knights, One Night in Paris). In the presence of such greatness, one wonders why it wasn't even worse than it was.Final score: 0/10.",House of Wax

When they are looking for a gas station to get a piece to repair there car they run into what looks to be an abandon town until they disrupt a church service. After this point, there trip to the game turns ugly... REAL UGLY 1st off, they could have found someone better to play Paige than Paris Hilton, she was one of the reasons i ranked the movie so low, there are other reasons why this movie could improve. some good things about this move: normally in scary movies people are really dumb, but in this movie there isn't nearly as much stupidity as in like scream where like the victim always runs back into the house.

Elisha Cuthbert wasn't exactly exciting to watch but made a good effort but the main actors were the killers they were so funny especially the one with the mask he looked like Texas chainsaw massacre. i actually thought for a while that they were going to make a new house of wax because they said that there was 3 brothers not 2 but not any rumours of it coming out but maybe in the futures thats what they should think about but NEVER Paris HILTON AGAIN!!!!!!!!",House of Wax
476,gagaboskovic,House of Crap,1,27 October 2006,"The first time I ever saw this movie, I was having a sleepover with a small group of friends. We were planning an all-nighter and we were in the mood for a good scare. Boy, were we disappointed.Not a single aspect of the entire movie was good. The only reason this movie was ever successful was because of the cast and the huge budget. With Paris, Chad, Jared, and Elisha as the main characters, who would not expect the mobs of screaming fan girls piling into the theatres? With the amount of publicity this movie had, it was made out to be an amazing film in need of an Oscar.The acting was terrible. Every time anyone opened their mouth to either emit a scream that sounded more like moaning or a terribly delivered line, my friends and I were on the floor laughing like lunatics. Paris Hiltion has proved to us that she cannot act. The role she was cast to play is no different from who she is in real life. Even if she were a hobo, that would be the easiest role to play. Sit in a chair, smack your gum, twirl your hair and turn the next page in your Cosmo magazine and you're set.Elisha was no better. She was made out to be a heroine, when in fact she was an idiot. Yes, giving the villain (who's about to kill you) a sappy talking-to is definitely going to save your life. We don't live in a Disney land. The lines that she had were horribly delivered.I'd have to say that Chad takes the only medal for acting in this movie.The money that they had to spend on this film went towards A-list actors, cheesy effects and too much publicity.It was pretty sad because it was one of those movies were my friends and I were able to predict everything from the plot to their next lines. The characters had no depth to them, the effects just made you go, ""What the hell?"" and the plot was too predictable to tolerate. Overall, I'd have to say that it shouldn't be a horror movie. It should be a comedy.",House of Wax

480,nutty_pistachio,Very realistic and gory,7,29 November 2008,"I thought the movie was very realistic, and I could almost imagine this happening for real in one of those tiny American towns where there is little else to do but go to the only permitted religious house in America - church, see a film in the ancient movie theatre or visit the local wax museum. That said, the start of the movie focused too much on the group of friends who seemed much like any other horror movie victims and not nearly enough on the murderous brothers and their story. What could have been a very interesting story was rushed over to make way for a load of unnecessary garb about a football game, the context of which had me patiently wait for the good bit to start and remain baffled as to why anyone would travel for that long and without any real guarantee of success simply for the privilege of watching a sport they could probably get on TV at home. But then, I am English.However, Elisha Cuthbert, the freaky brothers and the witless but creepy hick they first meet are absolutely brilliant in their roles, although they do need some settling-down time. Paris Hilton, although with a distinct lack of experience compared to the others and apparent need to constantly talk about sex with her boyfriend and yet ridiculous timing when trying to tell her boyfriend something incredibly important, does seem to be getting into the swing of things and is suitably terrified at the correct times. Despite this, she's going to need plenty on roles in a succession of slightly crappy movies before she can handle much more than a few lines, no matter how rich her daddy is.I had some trouble rating this movie. Its special effects are certainly special and its main characters are convincing, but there are a few mistakes which bring it down. However, it also had plenty of gore which satisfied the curious child in me and was almost entirely plausible. It also made me reason that there's no need to visit Madame Tussaurds ever again and kept me up all night with dreams that were scarier than the film itself, so for horror fans, of which I now definitely do not count myself (at least for a good while), it's a pretty safe bet.",House of Wax

Paige's (Paris Hilton) boyfriend gets up and goes over to her and says ""Why haven't you ever made me that pretty, Carly?"". Now obviously Carly is played by Elisha Cuthbert and is not playing the part of Paris Hilton. I just wanted to point that out. This is probably one of the better movies I have seen. It isn't the best one however. Paris Hilton's death scene however is one of the better parts of the movie. Overall I found the movie to be action packed, gory, and entertaining.",House of Wax

(All though a borrowed one) I thought the original film with Vincent Price was a classic. However, you can't really compare the two movies except in name, and concept. One of the things that I really liked about the movie was the brother/sister relationship. (POSSIBLE SPOILER)Some of the things I didn't like about the movie were the comparisons drawn between the brother and sister, and Bo and Vincent.

483,bamf28,You have got to be joking,1,27 May 2007,"What is wrong with half the people leaving comments here? This movie is not scary, suspenseful, realistic, and unlike most bad horror movies it wasn't even funny. There are many, many flaws with this film and I'm going to lay them all out right here.First of all, why the hell do they stop their cars and set up camp in some uncharted forest? And then they stay after some creep in a rusty truck shines his headlights on them? I mean come on. Right off the bat I knew this movie wouldn't scare me because I would never even think of putting myself in a situation that just screamed at some random killers to come and kill me. Had the characters in this movie ever even watched a horror film before? Then when that one kid that gets his Achilles tendon cut, why the f u c k is he walking around some creepy guy's house who lives in a deserted town located in the middle of the forest? This film clearly demonstrated to me the stupidity of the average person.So after that I decided to have a good time with it and try to get a laugh out of it. Unfortunately that would never happen. The makers of this movie tried to use gore to frighten the viewers and apparently it worked on these dumbasses that are writing reviews here. Yea, yea so it is sick when that first guy gets his heel split open, but was it scary? No. It was sick, but far from frightening. When Paris Hilton gets a pole through her head. That was again, sick, but not scary. My friend got freaked out when the first guy gets his face ripped off, but I just said that his dumbass friend shouldn't have tried to keep going after he noticed that he was in fact, ripping his face off.Also, how stupid can the brother and sister be? When they have the one crazy brother passed out on the ground with a bunch of arrows in him, why not kill him then? I just can't comprehend how stupid the characters in this movie are. It just appalls me. How unintelligent can one movie get? Although this movie did leave me speechless. I just couldn't believe how people can be scared of a movie that was so, so... I just can't think of a strong enough word to describe how ridiculous this movie is. I guess you have to see it to believe it. But for those who want to see it for a deeper meaning, I guess you could pull a few points out of it: It blatantly displays the stupidity of the average 20 year old who lives in the suburbs and is borrowing their parents' car for the weekend. It also has some great tips on how to land yourself in situations that will ultimately end up in your death.Well, Paris Hilton did offer some eye-candy for a few moments so I guess that's one more reason.",House of Wax

The reality is that Paris has a fairly minimal part, she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen. The film also makes fun of her on several occasions, usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision. For those who enjoy Paris Hiltons stage presence, this may be a movie to see at home when its released on video, because at the screening I was at, we all laughed at her misfortunes through the movie and she is portrayed as a ""woman of questionable values"".The movie itself was pretty good (unlike the recent flood of weak horror flicks), it has everything a good horror should; a creepy villain, excessive violence, acts which make that average person cringe...this movie hit all the bases.

Nothing original at all. It would have been better if they wouldn't have taken themselves so seriously.

He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted. If they weren't in the movie, well, you might not really like it too much.

Obviously, you know who will with what I just typed. The movie may be predictable (in fact, I had a pretty good idea who would die just by watching the trailer), but it was still enjoyable.

I bought it the other day and watched it the same evening. It was good fun like I remembered. These kinds of films have a way of bringing out the teenager in you (well the good ones do anyway). It's a cut above many other films in the teen-scream type genre. There are some very impressive scenes towards the end which I imagine were tricky to shoot. One criticism I have is that the film is slightly too long, at roughly 1h 50mins, it's perhaps 15-20 mins longer than necessary and could have been wrapped up much quicker as it is generally a relatively fast paced movie throughout. Also, whoever was in charge of Elish Cuthbert's wardrobe for this film may want to take another look at this one, some very questionable decisions were made here! Overall, well worth watching, plenty of thrills and spills and a good soundtrack.",House of Wax
501,glittergrl14142,what a movie !,10,21 May 2005,"I just read a comment in which a user said not to waste your money on this movie and I was shocked. Although I admit this movie was not for the faint of heart, this movie was amazing ! I can not imagine it being acted or directed better than it was . Anyone who's looking for a scary time, House of Wax is a must ! I was held in suspense in my seat all night long. The outcome was unsuspecting but awesome. I only hope other horror movies are like this one. I can't wait for the movie to come out on DVD. Hopefully there will be a stormy night in which i can watch it again. Hope this helps any and all movie watchers! I know I loved it and I hope everyone else does to. By the way, Jared Padalecki and Chad Michael Murray looked very good in this movie. Just a note for girl viewers!",House of Wax
502,Jason101,Clichés Ahoy!,4,6 June 2005,"I'll be honest, I didn't go into this movie with an open mind. I was fairly sure that this was going to suck better than the actress who is the only reason half of the audience will go to see this movie.I love being right.It wasn't as bad as it could have been, I'll give it that. Unfortunately, underneath the buckets and buckets of gore (and there is PLENTY of that...) there isn't anything done here that hasn't been done at least twenty times before. The old 'teen horror' movie textbook has been well and truly battered, as the film drags through the motions, never really looking like it wanted anything more than to get to the cinemas for a month or so before getting a quick 'uncut' DVD release.The mechanics of the film never really get going, either. Very rarely do you ever feel like any of the characters are in any real danger, and even less often do you actually care - the film takes so damn long to get going that after about 45 minutes of absolute nothing that you find yourself WANTING someone to die, just to break the monotony. There are also plenty of attempts at symbolism, especially towards the end, but most of them are far too blatant, and hence fall flat on their face.On the upside, Paris Hilton doesn't suck as badly as I thought she would in this, although it seems that the directors wisely kept her screen time to a minimum, and when she was on screen she rarely did anything you wouldn't expect her to do in real life, so whether she was acting or not is debatable. The actors for the most part are competent without ever really being given the chance to be spectacular.Overall, this could have been much worse - it manages to hold itself together for the most part, although there are some silly goofs that could really have been avoided. Don't let this fool you though - this film is a bog-standard slasher flick that does nothing any better than any other horror film you've seen this year.4/10",House of Wax
503,katiemonkey,"Alright, but still fun",6,1 May 2005,"I went to see this movie last night at the New York premiere, to be honest, I'm not a huge horror fan, I was more enticed to go in order to see the stars and all that. I have to say that the movie really wasn't very scary--it was way more utterly disgusting. I don't know if that's something people are really looking for, if it is, you'll be sure to like this movie. There were approximately 3 actually ""scary"" parts of the movie and the rest of it was more like you becoming completely grossed out with all the gruesome deaths. Despite the lack of horror, I did enjoy the movie. I thought that the characters, particularly those of Chad Michael Murray and Elisha Cuthbert, were pretty good, and you did care for them to some extent. Also, I thought that Elisha's acting was best. The movie was certainly enjoyable enough, but if you're looking to get really scared then this isn't the movie to see.",House of Wax

Seriously, when Paris Hilton was killed, half of the audience screamed (pretty gory/violent death) while the other half CHEERED (Hilton went down - and in lingerie, of course)!Seriously, we're talking freaking hilarious. And for all of the ladies, one hot wb boy gets nice and shirtless (although i do really think the director should have made him hit a tiki-tan, a little pasty for my taste).

506,JDela88,Surprisingly entertaining!,6,6 May 2005,"It is so easy to blast House of Wax, but even though it has a cast that is better known for their bodies than their acting abilities, House of Wax proves to be an entertaining joyride.Sexy people be damned, most of the cast gets mangled and scarr'ed relatively quickly. In fact, House of Wax is filled with some great popcorn gross-em-out violence, and features some of the most creative death scenes since the last Final Destination movie (and parents, please note the R rating and don't come back complaining because you thought it was safe to take your daughter because she LOVES Chad Michael Murray).Of course this film cannot take itself too seriously; check out the mini-parody of the Hilton sex tape. Hilton, in fact, is great for what this role requires. You don't have to be Meryl Streep to play a blonde girl being chased by psychos, yet Hilton has a charm that most MTV blonde-bimbos lack.This movie is 100 times better than the last slew of B-horror remakes (Amityville, Chainsaw Massacre). Stunning visuals and effects, the director does a great job considering what he's working with (the climax in the wax house is a nice edge-of-your-seat moment). It is clichéd to the max, but their are plenty of little gems that redeem the film a make it entertaining.",House of Wax

508,bizzymonkey,A fresh-faced look at the dumb things young adults do in the horror genre...,5,8 May 2005,"I went in WANTING to see this movie simply because it looked fun, and I was also curious as to what Hilton's acting ability was. With that being said, let's begin my review.We start the movie by taking a glimpse at the killer's past, and it gives us clues as to how he became the psycho-killer that he is today. Fast-forward to the present day, and you'll find a group of 6 young adults anxiously looking forward to an upcoming road trip to a football game.In two unusually nice cars they set off on their adventure through the backwoods of Louisiana and come up with the fantastic idea of setting up camp in a conveniently large area big enough to accommodate tents the size of a Hummer. Everything is fine and dandy until some jerk flashes his brights on them. Nick (Murray), being the bad-ass he is, decides to throw a rock and break the headlight of the truck.As the strange truck drives away, Nick receives a string of generic ""You showed him, man!"" compliments when, if I were there, would be thinking ""Welp, we're dead."" While watching the movie, I had forgotten how annoyed I get when the characters say, ""Let's go into this dark house!"" or ""Let's hitch a ride with this insane hillbilly!"" I knew it was a formulaic horror movie, but why in God's name could they not make the character's just a teensy bit smarter? What surprised me was the lack of killing in the first half hour or so of the movie. It was pretty dull up until people start dying.As for Paris, she did well. She did what she was supposed to do and pulled it off. I'm not saying we'll see her win an Academy Award anytime soon, but I'm sure we'll see more of her in these ""young people"" movies. I mean, come on, she's a huge selling point whether you want to admit it or not.The conclusion was a lot of fun to watch even though it was overdone. What annoyed me even more was the explanation as to why all these missing people hadn't been found. You'll see what I mean.Bottom line: It was a fun, mindless horror movie full of young and dumb good-looking people. In other words, it went a little too much by the rules of teen horror even for me.",House of Wax
509,duder-4,first of its kind,8,10 May 2005,"house of wax was a very interesting movie. i had not seen or heard of anything that deals with people who murder others using wax. it was also very interesting to see an entire house made up entirely of wax.i thought that the acting in the movie was fine. i have heard that a lot of people disapproved of Paris Hilton's acting ability but it couldn't have been better. i don't think that the movie was imperfect because of the lack of talent of the actors.the movie seemed to be a typical teen horror flick and i think that the movie was aimed at teens. there was a large amount of violence and blood but that is to be expected of a lot of movies now. while there was a lot of violence i don't think that it was excessive, on the contrary, there could have been more.the movie was cool and i would recommend this movie to anyone with a few bucks and a few hours of time on their hands because i doubt that they will be disappointed.",House of Wax
510,pman-7,House of Clichés,1,8 May 2005,"This is arguable the worst movie I have ever seen since Cabin Boy. The presumptuous plot (and I use the word lightly) follows a group of teens on their way to a football game. They take a shortcut which puts them on back roads where they decide to camp out for the night. If you cannot finish the story with that intro, check your pulse because you're probably dead. The only thing this movie does well are shock elements. Gruesome scenes of over-the-top violence which are so gory as to be humorous. The story is clichéd and predictable, the characters are flat and overused in this genre, the acting is mediocre at best, and the dialogue is bland, boring, and uninspired. This movie is indicative of the carelessness that commonly goes into this genre. Rather than carefully building a story and evoking powerful performances which can both terrify and thrill the audience, House of Wax takes what could have been an interesting theme, then ruins it with horrible writing and bad acting. The characters are so unmemorable and even downright irritating that you will find yourself begging for their deaths. Instead of wasting $7 on this filth, go rent a movie like Frailty and enjoy true horror.",House of Wax

They picked the hottest stars at this moment for the roles, of coarse it's not going to be realistic. It's a bit on the gory side, but not as bad as Cabin Fever. This movie shouldn't still have you scared once you've left the theater. You will get spooked though, and you will jump. There's not much sexual content, besides a little underwear viewed. Violence isn't a big deal either. This movie is one of those things where you just wish you could tell the character to stop and not be so stupid. But that's every horror film for you isn't it? This movie's a horror flick, not one of those movies that moves you and makes you think, it's just a summer movie with lots of hot stars. But they did a wonderful job doing so though.

The plot was overall pretty good, and I was really surprised by the lack of cliché's. Although at times it really felt like I was watching the Texas Chainsaw Massacre all over again. Normally I can handle gore pretty well, but I have to say that the death scenes in this movie made me physically sick. I saw the movie this afternoon and my stomach still hurts. The gore was a little extreme, and definitely freaked me out. I'll say I spent a good third of the movie hiding my eyes. Paris Hilton wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, and actually did a pretty fair job acting. I can't say I'd see it again, but I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys the gory, clinging to your friends kind of movie. It was definitely an above average horror movie",House of Wax

Chad Michael Murray did a pretty good job with his character and showed that he can play some different roles.Overall, I don't think I could watch it again.

However, never have I seen such a pile of pish as House of Wax. Putting aside the laughable excuse for a plot and ""character development"", this film rests on implausibility to the nth degree. The titular house burns to the ground, despite being made entirely of wax and not having any wick. Think back to GCSE Chemistry - wax, by itself, will not burn. It needs a wick or something to act as a catalyst. Also, none of the annoying cast burns themselves on the molten wax. Remember what it feels like when a drop spits onto your skin? Well, these people are wading in it up to their waists. The acting is pretty poor, but it is the deaths that disappoint. While definitely gory, this film is not remotely scary and deaths without scares are just nasty. Avoid this at all costs - I read the reviews already on IMDb and still decide to go despite them. Please heed mine and other's warnings! Stay away! I beg you.",House of Wax
517,the_third_man5,Good not great...,6,4 June 2005,"Before I start, let me just say that I had very low expectations. The only two cast members I had seen anywhere else were Cuthbert (24, OMG!!! Damn you Kim!!!) and Hilton (well, nuff said). The concept of the film seemed interesting, and hey, I thought as I went to the cinema, Kim Bauer might die! I was mistaken.The cast did it's work admirably. Elisha Cuthbert did a superb job, all but carrying the film. Paris Hilton did what she does best, which is behave like she doesn't think people are watching. There was a collective cheer when she bought it.The main problem with this film was the execution, plot and script.The idea was good. But the film itself meandered along to the anticipated conclusion with pathetic attempts at meaningful imagery and useless, wooden villains. The utterly pointless attempt at a twist at the end serves no apparent purpose then to justify the existence of a minor character.Having said all this, it is worth seeing. Despite all the problems I found with it, Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray managed to carry the film between them, and added some depth and character development. All in all, if you've got some time and want a cheap thrill, give it a watch. The only way a problem may arise is if you go in expecting a proper horror film.",House of Wax
518,DFlo22,Yep.,4,7 May 2005,"Yea, the movie was pretty bad. What made it even worse, was during the beginning I'm just sitting there eating some dots and out of nowhere I see a microphone pole. I was like NO WAY! That did not just happen. I told my friends and they didn't see it at first then again the microphone dipped down into the screen and all of us just lost it. It happened about 20 more times throughout the movie. Although the movie wasn't that good, we all got a good laugh. The more I thought about it, the editors couldn't have misses something that big. It turns out that the movie employee in charge of the camera that plays the movie didn't set the screen right so it was off a good inch. Anywho, just thought I would share.",House of Wax

OK, at the beginning, it's like relax, teens in camping (a little too much like Blair project, with the guy filming the tent and the people sleeping..... so not original). but in the second part with all the butcher thing it's even not scary, it's only disgusting. I cannot imagine that Chad Michael Murray who is certainly receiving millions of screenplay went put his nose in this crap. It's like too much, we didn't need to see the head of Paris Hilton filled with a stick during 30 second. And the last scene when the house is melting is ridiculous. TOO MUCH! they haven't hear of the word moderation??

520,Movielover50077,House of Wax,6,9 May 2005,"*****SLIGHT SPOILER***** House of Wax is another one of those Hollywood remakes. If you think you know where it's going you're wrong. House of Wax is different. It's actually pretty good. Yes, it's a teen slasher flick, but it works. The plots a tad weak, but it's still good. The deaths are extremely gory, but that's how it should be. The acting is worthy (Paris can act for those of you who are wondering). I do however, have a few complaints, the whole thing about how nobody ever knew about the town was there was way to unbelievable. Also, how can the whole House of Wax be made of wax? And when I say everything I mean everything....the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and everything in between. How can you build that? It seems like it'd be really hard. Despite those problems, House of Wax is a fun film. Don't take it seriously, just sit back and enjoy.

522,itsascreambaby96,House Of Wax: Focussing On The Killing & Not The Characters!,10,14 May 2005,"Overall House Of Wax is a really good movie, it has all the elements 'slasher' buffs will love, group of generic teens, disturbed killer(s), creative killings, gore aplenty. Although the movie as a whole is a lot of fun, some parts of it have an 'unfinished' or 'rushed' feel to them, such as the character development and underuse of most characters. As for the characters, if you are a fan of Elisha Cuthbert (who does a great job, she is a fantastic actress) or Chad Michael Murray you should be pleased as they feature heavily throughout. If you are going to see this movie for Paris Hilton's presence I recommend you don't bother, you will be severely disappointed in her extremely limited role as 'Paige', in fact it borders on a cameo appearance, you can really tell the producers wanted to keep her off the screen as much as possible, her acting is barely passable and she just says a few lines here and there. Jared Padalecki doesn't have much to do and neither do Jon Abrahams or Robert Ri'chard who are just there to basically be knife fodder! There are numerous plot holes in the movie but if you enjoy it enough and switch your brain off you will just accept the movie for what it is, a fun ride. The gore isn't too bad, a finger being cut off is probably the most gruesome scene. Paris' death scene is cruel and vicious but overrated as it doesn't last long. So if you are looking for a fun teen slasher that has all the elements that you'd expect and enjoy by all means go for it! It's a really good movie, just don't expect to much from the minor characters, namely Paris Hilton who is credited high up but doesn't do much at all (except strip and die!)",House of Wax

I knew the one ""neck"" who picked them up had to be related to the brothers because in the beginning you couldn't see any of the babies' faces. But the problem was on one was dying and they were trying to fill up the space with sub plots and character analysis and that ain't what going to see a scary movies is about. When Eisha Culthbert is telling all this stuff about her and her brother I was just thinking ""I know, you don't have to explain it to us, it's already implied....very very implied. And all the Paris Hilton hoopla with her doing kinky stuff on the camera...was that a kick back to her sex tape? That was tacky! I gave it a 4 because once people started to die, it was back to back so that was fun. And I thought there were some good death scenes (Paris actually had a good one). But my favorite was when Elisha got her finger tip cut off and couldn't scream because her mouth was glued shut. And the thing about the brother was he was really tough so it was comforting.

This is compounded by the casual nature in which these acts are committed.While all of this is very interesting, the film as a whole falls short. All of the characters are completely one-dimensional and even dumber than your average slasher victims. The entire plot follows the slasher formula to the letter.

Paris was alright and her chase scene was decent. It wasn't close to as good as Sarah Michelle Gellars in IKWYDLS, but it was pretty good. The special effects were awesome, especially at the end! The characters were cool, except all the characters fall for the classic blunders, like walking into a deserted house, etc etc. BUT the characters also had a lot of realistic reactions.

I saw a preview at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival this weekend and was sorry I wasted both my time and money in doing so. A movie that has been made 3 times prior successfully would normally seem like a given but this movie like so many other American Hollywood horrors of today have forgotten what horror is. They cater to the mindless shock and gore effect that for some god forsaken reason draws our mindless youth to see it. The mere fact Paris Hilton is in this version should tell you something. It felt like I was watching a Halloween version of the OC which was sickening. So many inconsistencies and in all no real horror. I was able not only to predict every turn of events but every big bang or villain appearance meant to make you jump. I fear that we now mistake anticipation of someone jumping out from the shadows as being scared rather than the psychological aspect that really does. I have been a horror fan for over 20 years (longer than most of todays fans have been alive) and if you leave a horror movie and are not looking over your shoulder then it wasn't scary. I had the pleasure to see some horror during the festival from other countries such as ""Premonition"" from Japan, ""Nightwatch"" from Russia and ""Shutter"" from Tailand and I have to say unless American horror abandons this teen slasher premise and gets back to basics the rest of the world will pass us by....hell they already have.",House of Wax

It isn't one of those horror movies where characters don't get developed. The movie had to have been at least 45 minutes into it before anyone gets it. Those first 45 minutes are also very entertaining for a horror movie even though no one dies because it sets up a plot pretty well. I really enjoyed watching this movie and i don't want to give anything else away. I recommend this flick to all of you, who want to see blood and gore with lots of sarcastic humor.

532,Tonyteeceetn,A Bizarre Slasher/Gothic/Deliverance Film Poses the Question--Twins: Good or Bad?,6,6 May 2005,"While undeniably a mess, ""House of Wax"" is a FUN mess, and unlike, say, ""The Amityville Horror,"" it holds your attention. If only for the running internal commentary you've got going: ""Why did she do that? That's completely out of character...I mean, caricature. Why are the Gilmore Boys in this film and where's Rory? Will Jack Bauer show up and save his daughter? How self-referential can Paris Hilton BE?""As one might expect, the movie has stunning special effects that are inevitable, given the title. This Slasher/Gothic/Deliverance hybrid's storyline is odd, the characters are poorly drawn, unlikable, for the most part, and the actors bring little to them, but we don't really expect much in horror anymore, do we? It would be silly to put Naomi Watts in something like this. Paris Hilton will be just fine. Chad Michael Murray fills out his role more than the other pretty, pretty actors, but (unintentionally?) gives off a delightful, creepy sexual tension with his female twin. One moment between the two might have ended in a kiss.The film gives nods to previous suspense films, and though gory beyond belief--it fascinates. A question that rarely arises in horror films is prompted: What does all this MEAN? It is written by twins, and the screenplay fixates on them (without giving us anything) so much that it makes one wonder about the screenwriters and their possible issues. Unlike ""The Ring 2,"" this movie throws out atmosphere for cheap thrills and silly character choices, though whether made by the authors or the actors or director is unclear. It made this critic want to see Elisha Cuthbert intentionally do comedy. Depending on your expectations, a much better product than it merits.",House of Wax

But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT. EVER SINE AUGEST WHEN I HEARD ABOUT IT I BRAGGED AND BRAGGED and in school i gave out flyer's saying may 6 house of wax see it. i got my whole school into it.

534,ecstasyxtouch,Melt me any day,10,6 May 2005,"I usually don't comment on anything; quite frankly, I wasn't even registered with this site. However, I felt the need to today, as I saw the movie not more than three hours ago as well as read the comment prior to mine. Let's cut to the chase now shall we? The burning question: was it worth my while? My answer is yes. I'm ticked at people claiming to be hardcore ""REAL"" horror fans and putting those movies down that aren't incredibly scary. Just because the movie isn't the most scariest thing does not make it a bad movie. The other commenter compared it to movies from Thailand, Japan and some other foreign film. I must admit that other countries do take horror to another level, but playing the scary down a notch or two does not mean that the movie is suddenly horrible. There ARE other things to take into consideration too, you know? The scenery for one, was amazing. I loved the effects and music (well I'm a MCR fan, so I loved that they played them at the end). There was also a main plot, so it was not all ""kill kill gory gory sex sex."" (Despite what you all may think since Paris was in it. Hell, she was even somewhat tolerable, but bare in mind that I say this with much leniency.) Besides the main plot, (which was more played down than not) there were also mini plots scattered about if you care to look beneath the surface. Plus, there are under lining stuff which introduces themes that I was actually in favor of. You can even go on the limb and call it social commentary if you'd like.Bottom line: if you are out for ""REAL"" horror I suppose, and nothing else, then don't see it. If you are interested in the movie just because you like the stars in it, then go ahead because I thought that a majority of the cast did a stellar job. If you are in a fun mood and want to go out and have yourself a little fright, then the movie is for you too. I loved it.One more thing I have to add. I know quite a bunch of people said that the movie was unoriginal. But seriously, think about what you're saying. ""The remake of this old horror film was unoriginal."" REMAKE and UNORIGINAL cannot go into one sentence together. If it's a remake, you obviously should expect some, if not a bunch of similarities. Idiots.",House of Wax
535,RhenMyster,Was I The Only One Watching This Movie?,1,6 May 2005,"I've read many reviews, and many complaints about House of Wax. However, these complaints and diatribes of hatred for this movie are for something far less disturbing than the thing that made me sick throughout the film. I love making movies. In fact, my career plan is to work in the film industry, and one day getting in the seat of the director's chair. So it's natural for me to critique plot, characters, tone, and camera angles. I do tend to look down upon poorly filmed movies, yet I have never become sick and nauseous from one, until now. This one major, significant error in the film has been left out of every review I've read. Therefore, I must ask myself, ""Was I the only one watching this movie?"" Because what I saw, which terrified me and still leaves me in utter disbelief, can be, in no way, ignored or overlooked by the common eye. This blatant error - though, it's too enormous to simply be classified as an error - burned my retina with its obvious flaw. I'm sure you're all familiar with mic poles: long mics that are hung above actors to carry the voices. Well, one decided to get his movie debut by popping into the flick during the first twenty minutes. I sat up immediately. I was startled, but I let it go: every movie has at least one mistake it in: this was theirs, so I'll let it go. It didn't bother me too much. However, after the twentieth time, I began to be perturbed. How can a director let this type of terrible mistake enter his movie and not re-shoot? Better yet, what kind of producer would permit this film to be showed? Were they all too stupid to check the tape for any mistake before packing up their equipment from the location. I felt like Ashton Kutcher had to be sitting somewhere in the back of the theater laughing his ass off as he PUNK'D us all. I am still in complete shock, and feel perhaps I dreamed the whole thing up and it was only a nightmare.",House of Wax

537,amazonblonde2004,"Not quite what I expected, but still worth seeing",7,7 May 2005,"I have only gone to the movies twice by myself ever, and never to a horror movie by myself. The hubby was not interested in seeing this, so off I went yesterday to the first showing in my town. It was being screened in the largest theater there, and when I walked in no one else was there! I had already planned on sitting in the very back so I would not be as spooked having someone behind me. Well, the previews began and I started realizing I would be watching what could be a completely horrifying movie all by myself-in a huge vacant theater! It seemed to start off slow. I had watched the House of Wax show on MTV and was waiting for the wax and gore to flow. Once it did, I was not really terrified to be there by myself. There were parts I felt could have been more nerve wrecking for effect, and parts I thought would be more scary that ended up being quite gentle. The storyline itself was good, but I went in expecting everyone to get waxed except for the brother and sister pair and I thought it would be one of those all out disgusting movies that could even make a 29 year old afraid of wax. Not sure who played Paris Hilton's boyfriend in the movie, as I do not remember even seeing him on the MTV show about the movie. Pretty strange he was left out of the publicity for the movie as he had almost as much screen time as the others. It was not as campy as I thought it would be, and more of the history leading up to the current situation could have been portrayed by doing more flashback scenes. There was only one of those, and it was brief and at the very beginning and really did not set up the storyline in a way that could have been more suspenseful. I do want to see it again, as when I first saw the funeral scene I do not recall noticing all the wax people in attendance. Then again, there were a few moments I would look around the theater in disbelief that I was in that enormous thing all by myself. In summary, you can go and see this flick all by yourself, alone in a huge theater and still live through it to sign up and write a review about it. I do plan to watch the original movie again now after seeing this. The script could have benefited from more creative writing, but the cast did a good job with what they were given to work with.",House of Wax

Now let's see, we have ""The Longest Yard"" coming out. To make this film even a little bit legitimate, they had to bring Reynolds back. And let's face it how many times do we need to hear, ""You can do it."" before we need to relieve ourselves. Now ""Herbie's"" back. I think they should let it rest in peace in that great big Disney junkyard in the sky. And if anybody hasn't guess it yet Brad and Jolie's Mr and Mrs Smith is a poor remake of Pritzy's Honor.

It's just meant to be a good time. Whether you laugh or whether you cringe... I thought it was worth a matinée price. As for Paris, she did well (in my opinion). Is she the next Julia Roberts?

540,Csisk21,The absolute worst movie of 2005.,1,7 May 2005,"House of Wax was by far the worst written, directed, and casted movie I have seen in the past five years. The concept of the movie was the EXACT SAME as the modern Texas Chainsaw Massacre. A group of college kids are going from Point A to B when they take a wrong turn and are forced to stop in the middle of nowhere. Here's where Chainsaw Massacre comes in. They stop in a deserted town lacking police force and any type of outside communication. The day after their camp out, one of the characters falls in a swamp of dead deer. The story continues on, miserably, and one by one the teenagers get picked off by some deformed man and his brother. All of this time, Paris Hilton displays her inability to do anything other than ""that's hot."" The whole audience actually laughed and applauded when she died in the movie. The movie was so horribly unrealistic that you just start to laugh. If you have a choice between going to see House of Wax and getting a route canal, you shouldn't hesitate to go see your dentist. If a 1/10 were the absolute worst rating you could give this movie, I'd give it a -25/10.",House of Wax

I'm of course referring to Paris having a pipe utilized in the very manner we'd like to have a large, sweaty, fungus infected sock used. Injected right in that useless burger-gorging catch-phrase spewing mouth! That being said, the rest of this ""film"" is so by the numbers it's not worth mentioning. Teenagers should stay away from the back woods, say no to alcohol, and avoid sex in unfamiliar surrounding. Not to Director: the next time you feel the need to have an ""actress"" perform a strip tease on film try using one that doesn't share the dimensions of a hat rack.

The beginning was slow and average, however the movie picked up from there. The acting was surprisingly better than I thought it would be. This would be due to Paris Hilton being in the movie. She was actually believable in her role and I hope to see her excel. Chad Michael Murray was good as well. I think that people are taking the roles that they play on TV and life to justify their negative attitudes. Everyone should remember that no one becomes an academy award winning actor(s) in their first movie. There are many actor(s) that played B rated movies that are todays excelling movie stars.

I walked out scared and horrified, and totally surprised by the film. It is one of the better scary movies released in many years. Aside from Paris Hilton's inability to act (she wasn't even in it that much), everyone else was great, and the movie kept me on the edge of my seat, and my girlfriend squeezing my hand nonstop. Although there are some unnecessary gruesome images, the intensity of the movie overrode any nausea. The movie is about a town of wax people, and each was led to the town only to become part of its display. A major downfall of the movie I found is that the 2 main characters were brother and sister; rather than lovers of some kind. This prevented any kind of big, climactic kiss or anything at the end (should they survive), but if you go to see a horror film you shouldn't expect that anyway.

Hollywood needs to get a grip and do some cultural investigations before the filmmakers show their lack of investigation. someone obviously was trying to get rich at the cost of a culture that is beautiful and unique. people in Louisiana don't have pet alligators, ride in over-sized ""pirogues"" (those long boats that are seen in photographs) when going to school (yes there is a lot of dry land in the state), or dump roadkill into a large pit...we usually leave it on the road like the rest of normal Americans. i suggest leaving this roadkill of a movie alone too.",House of Wax

Are You Kidding?"", just some of the remarks that could have been read on the net before people even gave this film a fighting chance. Quite a while back, those good 'slasher flicks' kind of died out, leaving the door open for supernatural horrors to soak up the spotlight. Films such as 'The Ring', 'Hide And Seek', 'Boogeyman' and 'The Grudge' to name only some, became a whole lot more popular leaving me aching for a good slasher flick. When I heard of 'House Of Wax', I almost died of excitement but was worried I may be disappointed after reading reviews of people who have no idea what they were talking about, I left the cinema thinking it was honestly one of the best films I'd ever seen. With a hot, awesome cast all of which worked really hard and did amazing jobs, a fresh, original and clever storyline, a kick-ass soundtrack and some really creepy aspects this film is an instant classic. In my opinion, this film did exactly what it was made to do, scare you, excite you, make you have a good time, and make you remember, remember not only those good old horror films we miss so much, but also the fact that not every new horror film is a disappointment, in fact, 'House Of Wax' is one horror film that'll be remembered as a classic in years to come just like the 1950's movie of the same name. I'm one hell of a horror fan, and If I could design a horror film from scratch, it would be 'House Of Wax' scene-by-scene. Sexy, scary, exciting, fun and an instant classic.

Are they all on PCP or something? The characters in this film MAY have been meant to be ""realistic"" in the sense that they didn't do anything right, but they were all complete slasher-flick stereotypes. If the main actress' boyfriend had been any more obnoxious, I would have killed him myself. I THINK that the writers (who had the same last name--twins, perhaps?) were aiming for one or two twists, but those fell utterly flat. The attempts at symbolism were as subtle as being smacked in the face by a 2x4. There a pleasing amount of gore and a nice girlfriend strip scene. For my part, I found it tasteful that the actress didn't actually bare her bottom or boobs (nicely showcasing her Victoria's Secret), but I think MOST guys would have rated that worse than I did.

558,frost_dragon_,Could have been called The house of snores.,3,19 May 2005,"First of all I'm a huge horror fan, so naturally when I saw the commercials for House Of Wax, I wanted to see it bad. Before seeing it I read a few unflattering reviews for it, but how awful could it be? So paying no heed I went straight off to see it. House of Wax is really summed up best as boring, formulated, and a copycat of a slew of other movies. Hers's a quick resumé. A bunch of Teens are on their way to see a far off Football game. The night before they camp out in a field and of course the next morning, one of them has car troubles. After this particular guy's girlfriend falls in a pit of dead road kill near the campsite, they are offered a ride by a strange fellow to a nearby town to get the missing piece for his car.By this point we are already a good half hour into the movie, and your starting to wonder if it's going to pick up soon, but dang it no, more waiting. So the guy and his girlfriend explore the creepy looking town (Which is strangely deserted.) but they don't pick up on that. Finally they come to the house of wax, which is totally empty, except for wax figures, and some creepy wax objects. Now this is where the movies actually starts, but what ensues is quite disappointing. This movie can't decide whether it's a creep fest, a slasher flick or a Texas Chainsaw Massacre ripoff. You have all these genre's thrown in, and none of them work. There is no tense or scary moments, the gore is very PG-13 and any self respecting horror fan will not even flinch. It's not funny either, so your really wondering while watching this, were the entertainment factor is. The actors do their best, yeah even Paris Hilton has more dialogue than ''That's Hot!'' though it might of added some much needed levity to this film. Yet the characters all go through the old and tired clichés that have been done in a hundred movies already, so you have to wonder if the people in the movie have ever seen a horror flick before, since they are making every mistake in the book. Most Characters are forgettable, so you don't care if they bite the dust or become wax. So all in all another disappointing horror flick. keep this one for a rental.

I very much enjoyed it. i really dislike when people bash, and put down everything about this generation. if you know you are not going to like a teen slasher flick, then don't see it. don't watch it just to complain about it. i mean, this movie has a sexy cast, 'a killer' on the loose, just plain creepiness and loads more....what's not to like?",House of Wax
560,AplusB16,Gory brilliance,10,25 May 2005,"i saw house of wax a couple of days ago and i got a bad stomach ache.it is really scary and i recommend it to everyone.its way better at night.its not a house of waste either .it was so cleverly done.i really enjoyed it,but i hated it when Paris died.but there are survivors.the killers die,but there's an Erie twist that is set up for a sequel.it rocked.but i have to say the goriest death part is when that dude tries to save another guy .the guy was earlier turned into wax , but only his skin.so the guy tries to peel it off idiotically not realizing that its his skin.so hes peeling his jaw off.then the dude has the killer behind him and he cuts half his skin from his face off.ugh.he cant move or blink .and he starts crying.then dies.Paris....poor Paris she gets her ankle sliced open then the killer threw a pole in her beautiful head.then pulled her head off of it.....a$$hole.well they all die except two.but let me stop spoiling it.go and see it!!!!!!",House of Wax
561,hottsillybeotch_2005,i love this movie,10,26 May 2005,"i freaking loved this movie it was the so cool, i would definletly go see it again and buy it when it comes out. Yeah and for all those people who laughed at Paris Hilton, u suck OK yeah, anyways Paris Hilton plays a sexy bitch that dies in a very clever way as well as all the other deaths in the movie, she was one of the smartest people in the movie. With good acting performances by all the others. You could hardly tell that this was for most of them there first horror movie. This movie made me jump and it made me scream and shutter in fear, it also grossed me out, and that makes the perfect horror movie. It is a must see and Paris Hilton rocks",House of Wax
562,PabloStefHoney,Fantastic,10,18 May 2006,"I love this movie. I think the plot line is good. A group of friends (Carly Jones, Nick Jones, Paige Edwards, Wade, Dalton Chapman, and Blake) are on their way to an important football game, while along the way, they decide to camp in some woods. The next day Wade's car experiences car troubles with a broken fan belt. Carly and Wade decide to go to the nearest town to get a new fan belt while the rest of the group attempts to go to the game. When an unbelievably slow traffic jam stops Paige, Chapman, Drake, and Nick, they decide to go back to get Wade and Carly. One by one, the entire group ends up falling prey to two murderous brothers, the creators of the town's local 'House of Wax'. They must escape before they become the House of Wax's main exhibit.

564,ilikerednipples,SPOILERS!! you know you wanna read this..,9,27 May 2005,"probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's! after finding her boyfriend Blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck, Paige starts to run. well, speed walk is more respectable. she finds this like garage with all these cars in it. then (one of) the killers cuts her ankle from below (this whole time shes holding a HUGE metal spike)so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car. the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead.. I've NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED OR LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE.2. Paige's boyfriend Blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him (while hes on the ground) and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat.. then he dies.3. Elisha cuthbert (carly)(one of the hottest chicks EVER) doesn't die PHEW but she does get her lips super-glued together, punched in the face, and gets part of her index finger chopped off (yeah, i felt like heaving) 4. Carly's twin brother nick also survives, but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg.5. nicks best friend Dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs, and then is decapitated. his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink.. then he gets covered in wax.6. wade (Carly's boyfriend) gets his Achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors, and then is attacked by the same scissors. he doesn't die, but hes covered in wax, and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed, revealing his nasty bloody flesh. YUMMY...so there it is. Definitely WORTH YOUR MONEY.",House of Wax

This movie would be one to watch with your mates when your in a scared mood ! i absolutely love it to bits ( watched it 5 times in one day ! )i would recommend this film to many many different people including the ones who don't like scary movies because its not that bad at all except i would never see it at the movies ! it has a few jumps in it to frighten many !Overall i think this movie is brilliant and i defiantly recommend it to all people who enjoy a little fun and a bit of a scare because its always good to be sacred sometimes !,House of Wax

Overall the film was a really good watch..i must admit it did take a while for it to get going, but it was worth it..and the best bit is wen Paris Hilton gets killed (i have to admit i did laugh quite a lot). the ending was great, how the whole of the museum just melted away..it was good to watch..and i also thought it was good how the ending was between two sets of twins..thought that was quite clever! i think people who watch this film will make their own minds up about it, you will either love it or hate it..but i definitely loved it!! a great watch!",House of Wax

Not expecting much i was surprised that this movie gave many of the elements you would expect from the modern horror genre. it was fast paced, cool soundtrack, up coming young actors and some messed up killers. it reminded me of the remake of dawn of the dead in a good way. true it was predictable, but the symbolic referencing to twin-ship throughout the film and a well thought script kept the audience interested. and the gore went well and above what i was expecting, damn that girls got a swing! although never really scary. good way to waste a few hours and i have seen a lot worse horror films recently.",House of Wax
569,porachick,It was a good movie!!!,10,4 June 2005,"I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it. i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and i really enjoyed it and we were talking about it the whole way home! I would tell my other friends to watch this movie. i'm not saying it's the best movie that's ever hit the box office but it's a lot better than some people are describing it to be.

570,lord_deimos_,Very watchable,7,31 May 2005,"There's not really any spoilers in here but I wasn't sure so I put the title up anyways.---After seeing all the horror movies getting pumped out lately and getting more and more disappointed with each release I was a little sketchy on seeing this one. Has anyone noticed that every horror movie that comes out now is the same damn thing!? We'll this one is a little different.The movie starts off great with a scene from the past, using a grainy camera and old styles it instantly looks like an old horror movie. Shortly after-wards we are quickly shown the stars of the movie and away we go. Unlike most horror movies of late this one has a style of its own, just when you expect something boring and cliché to happen something fresh happens instead. A few of the characters are built up well and its not to hard to take a liking to them, making it more intense when their lives are threatened. Also finally we are presented with some kids with brains, I dunno if I'm the only one but I get so sick off seeing someone in trouble taking out the killer momentarily and fleeing only to be attacked again 5 minutes later.. um hello how about killing them they just tried to kill you... ""Oh no I'd rather try run away in some house I don't know and wait for someone to help me""The special effects in the movie aren't over done, its not a real bloody film, you see just enough to let you know people are hurting. The wax through out the movie looks awesome, all very well done. Overall I'd say the movie moves along quite nicely, you can get emerged easily and before you know it its all over. I wasn't bored through any parts of the movie which I can't say about other horror movies of late, it's not a classic but its the best thats come our recently.Now to go watch Alone in the Dark /me prepares for disappointment.",House of Wax
571,drift150,Its baaad,1,1 June 2005,"Well... probably the only time i'll write a review....this movie sucks. it is not only full of clichés now typical in horror movies, but it also uses the cheapest methods to scare the viewers.typical scene: the protagonist is in the dark. Looks down a corridor, nothing's there. Looks the other way and there's nothing. Looks back and *SHOCK"" the bad guy is staring at him. It also uses an excessive amount of gore and blood to scare the viewers.Very lame movie. Elisha Cuthbert is the only worthwhile reason to watch this movie.House of Wax is probably one of the poorest horror movies I have seen. Save yourself a few bucks and go watch something worth it.",House of Wax
572,joneslloyd,a good movie.. worth a watch at the least,7,2 June 2005,"I thought pretty much the OPPOSITE of the above review i liked the 'updated-ness' of it and think that film was suitable for its 'target audience' (its age was set as '15', so you expect the film to be made 'appealing' to that age band) good effects.. nice bits of gore..The character (argued by some: bar Paris Hilton) all played believable and engaging parts. The level of gore was pretty satisfactory for all you sickos out there!, plus the actual storyline (admittadly it is another remake) is very good.all in all, i'd say a great attempt at bringing a horror classic into the 21st centuryI enjoyed!",House of Wax

I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax! I totally got creepers out by the wax models in the house although they looked so real. I still haven't got the story with the twins at the moment, i am just waiting to get the DVD then watch it all over again. Thumbs up to such a great film! 11/10. All those people who don't like it, please don't bother 2 criticise my opinion as mostly everyone thinks its cool to do so. Also i think the Paris scene when she strips to her underwear is totally inconvenient. Why not just get a dog shagging some cat.. be more entertaining then that. When Paris death scene came up, i thought it was poor as she still kept running although a knife just went up her foot. Hmm.. interesting. !CHAD ALL THE WAY!",House of Wax

575,kiz_2497,House of wax,9,5 June 2005,I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through. So i say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film doesn't convince you to go watch it then it also has Chad Michael Murray in it which can't be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh?,House of Wax

So, I watched the movie, and it wasn't until the closing credits that the song began to play! But I am not complaining. House of Wax was such a phenomenal movie, I went to FYE and bought it on DVD earlier this week! I absolutely loved Paris Hilton's acting (boo on me if you want, I do not care), and the bloopers are hilarious! My favorite parts were honestly either a) Paris Hilton's lip-balm scene, b)Wade getting his face peeled partially off by Dalton, then hacked off by Vincent, or c) Paris' death. I loved this movie SO much.",House of Wax
577,senorita_166,not as good as i expected it too be!,6,22 December 2005,"well i was actually forced to watch this film last night and really only wanted to see chad shirtless and Paris's death scene. this is a pretty lame horror movie although does have some jumpy moments but is so predictable it takes the suspense and tension away!I felt the story was pretty weak at the beginning , a group of teenagers camp out only to get slayed by a crazy killer ....blah blah blah. we've heard it all before! The characters and acting in the film were a mixed bunch really. Elisha and Chad were very convincing in their roles and actually gave some emotion to the part leaving you glad that they stayed alive. Unlike much of the other characters. Paris Hilton thankfully doesn't have a major part in the story and it seems that she was only in the film to make some cheap publicity and to get people to see the movie (mainly hormonal young boys!!!) In most of the scenes she was basically only there for eye candy, performing a strip tease, sexual references and basically was just herself, no acting skills required!!! Yes her death scene was pretty funny , but i found myself cheering her death rather than feeling sorry for her which wasn't good! the other teen characters were pretty throw away and were only in about 2 scenes each , Jared was the most underused and i feel his character could have improved and shown some more tension with chad . although i think it was good that they stuck with the best actors , with the larger roles. Vincent/Bo was very scary but was very predictable although I'm being very picky at the moment! overall , was it a successful remake? i wouldn't know as i haven't seen the original but as a horror film it was....just okay, nothing special although keeping to the conventions of the genre but it did feel rushed towards the end. I wouldn't recommend it to hard core horror fans but i will advise fans of Paris, sex tapes, predictable horror and bad taste to watch it! xxxxp.s watch wax diaries on MTV to see just how crap an actress Paris is lol!",House of Wax
578,ken_warrior2000,Awesome,10,18 June 2005,"i just came back home from the cinema after watching ""House Of Wax"", this film is THE horror movie i was waiting to see. i've seen loads of horror films which personally i ended up with my friends making it a comedy, but this one IS the perfect horror movie. It is the only film who when i went out of the cinema i was still under a kind of shock. I was impressed by the magnificent work Dark Castle produced. It did not have any fouls, except one, in which the blond girl, after she saw her boyfriend dead on the ground, ran away from the camping site in the same direction in which they left in the beginning where they found the carcasses. Yet this time she ended up in the warehouse where the cars were kept. personally i think that there was a missing scene cuz its quite impossible to find a warehouse which was never seen before during the camping by day. As for the plan of the story, it was very well built and gave what a REAL horror movie should give, i.e. Suspense, creativity and most of all great sound. the sound is a crucial point in this movie as if while watching it you only see the scenes after each other, with the magnificent sound application it gave birth to a portal which absorbed everyone who was watching it. In total i noticed 8 people who went out of the theater due to its levels of brutality and gruesome (two of which were my gf and the gf of my friend he he). IT IS NOT FOR THE SOFT HEARTED.

HE IS FIT! Sophia bush is the luckiest person in the world for marrying chad Michael Murray and i loved the part when the stick when straight through Paris Hilton's head ha ha that was flipping funny. it was also funny when the house of wax was melting that was brilliant and when Elisha fell into the kill pit thing near the beginning. but i don't understand why chad Michael Murray can be a jerk to his sister one minute and then best mates with her the next minute!!!???? does anyone watch one tree hill with chad Michael Murray and Sophia bush it is brilliant......,House of Wax

This ""re-make"" didn't even follow the original storyline,the original didn't have murdering perverted hilly billies and a group of meddling kids that got lost while going to a football match! A complete waste of money and perfectly good popcorn that I almost threw up because of ..yes,their acting and of course those gruesome FORCED death scenes.The best one part was when Paris gets brutally murdered(tee-hee).

It has everything you need for an enjoyable horror movie. Violence was awesome, brutal! I couldn't believe how well done the gore and violence was.

The death scenes were wicked, the plot was original, and even the dialogue was good. It's not another one of those horror movies that is really predictable and boring. Don't write this movie off just because Paris Hilton is in it. She does a good job with her character and shes not even in it a lot. The cast is a good selection of young actors that helps develop the story and honestly makes it more believable. With the elaborate death scenes and great acting this is my favourite movie right now.

583,log_on2jess,i loved it!,8,16 October 2007,"Okay, so I know that it's kind of trashy, but i really enjoyed this movie! It's good fun! It sets the characters up in the intro, turns slasher for a bit, and then the ending is akin to a thriller -- by that i mean high action, blazing special effects and exceedingly close shaves during which the hero and heroine are very nearly slaughtered -- before triumphing at the end and thereby making the film a positive experience, not a negative depressing one which is how one can sometimes feel after a particularly bleak horror/slasher flick. This movie is not meant to be a communicative masterpiece; it doesn't have any social or political comment to make; it's not one of those ultra-serious, very-commendable, weightily-intelligent and solemnly-sombre movies that the academics of society all like -- possibly why the critics all turned their noses up at it and its lack of political/social/economic metaphor. It was made to be enjoyed by the masses, not the intellectuals -- not that i'm calling it stupid! Just a good time. Some of the acting wasn't all that great (think wade), but some was really good (elisha) and my friends and I all loved it and embraced it for what it was -- very good fun!

This movie was really one of the most scariest films i have ever seen. All of the actors/actresses chosen were perfectly suited for the characters and made the film feel more believable, than i ever thought imaginable. The effects used were of a very high standard. Even at parts of the movie i knew were going to happen, i still jumped in my seat, it was that well developed. So my advice is to check the movie out.

585,extemporanea,You will never look at a mannequin the same way again.,7,18 July 2005,"I like this movie. The first part is a bit slow, but it really picks up. It was full of torture and lovely gruesomeness. Paris's dance number is quite nice, as well as her death scene. The fact that Paris Hilton is ridiculously famous for various things (coughcough) makes her character very different than if she was an unknown. Everyone expressed joy at her bloody death, which is not the typical reaction to things of that sort. It seemed like the writers had this amazing idea (the house of wax part) but the rest is like it was written from a formula. The touches of sentimentality, the brother and sister bonding, among other things, seem awkwardly thrown in. The demented younger brother, when he is going at Blake with the garden shears, reminded me of Joey Jordison of SlipKnot.

587,doubldown,You should avoid this movie like they should have avoided this town!,3,26 October 2005,"This is my first ever review of a movie on IMDb, and ironically enough, it's for a movie that I hated. If we're rating movies on a scale of 1-10 and 9 (no such thing as being perfect) is something like the Godfather or another epic movie, then this movie, House of Wax, 2005, is an 8? Fine, it's an 8 relative to Horror movies? If Psycho is a 9, how in the world is this movie an 8? Where do we begin? First off, this movie follows every cliché in the book: splitting up when you're not supposed to, wandering off to places you're not supposed to visit, possessing arrogance, not taking anything seriously, gratuitous use of T&A, running upstairs when you should be running outside. Not all horror movies have to follow the cliché-filled rule book. It's when they don't follow the rule book is it great--never mind when they rewrite the rule book. Horror movies that set the standard for all those to come are the ones that are great. How about the terrible dialog? This sounds like something that was in the Playstation game, Resident Evil. It's so unbelievable and horribly written. Then there's the heroine trying to talk sense into a psychotic serial killer. How often does that work? What about the killer that is impaled, stabbed and shot at, yet he still walks home--LITERALLY. I understand that the killers/monsters in horror flicks are superhuman, but this person is NOT Michael Myers. This is not a person with powers that were bestowed upon him by the higher ups. This is the weirdo neighbor you have that lives down the street. Believe me, if you shoot or stab him, I'm guessing he'll be going down. ******BEGIN SPOILER* * * * * * * How about Bo waiting in the church? Why would someone stand in a wax-filled church? Was he hoping someone would walk in? That is so ridiculous. Then at the end of the film (it seems like every horror movie now has to drop the bomb at the end to make the audience say ""Ohhh!""), when it's revealed that Mom had 3 sons...where was this in the entire movie? There is no evidence whatsoever of a 3rd son: in the house, in the flashbacks, nothing. Was he ignored? Was he left for dead? If so, wouldn't he be angry with the other 2 brothers? And for those of you that think I'm being too harsh and say that my point about Bo waiting in the church is invalid because the 3rd son is in cahoots with them...how did the 3rd son get in touch with Bo and Vincent? That 3rd son didn't look like he had a cell phone in that run down truck of his. There are no functioning land lines in this ""town."" * * * * * * *END SPOILER******It's sad.

588,daledondale,amazing for a low budget movie,8,28 September 2005,"For the first time in a long time we get a good (real good) remake.It's not predictable and even if someone would predict something they would still jump from their seats. The casting was not bad at all. Elisha Cuthbert did a wonderful job, starting with her choosing this kinda character to changing her hair color (which was good coz for me if she kept it blond i would have thought about 24) but that's not the issue, she was FANTASTIC i can't think of anyone else playing her role. As for Chad Michael Murray i never thought he would be so good as a bad boy, he just deleted the audiences image of Austin in A Cinderella story and replaced it with Nick , which means he is on his way in being one of the most talented actors in Hollywood. Jared Padalecki is one of the main reasons that this movie is amazing (i'm not talking about his eyes or height ... etc) he was a very powerful element in the movie (SPOILER)showing a lot of people that there's more to maniacs to just killing but also slicing and putting wax all over somebody while listening to opera. The rest of the cast was not bad at all although Paris Hilton wasn't bad but she would have been better if she changed her EVERYDAY look and gotten more into the character.It was a good thing for the producers that they had Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray to cover up the whole Paris Hiton thing since the had her as the foundation stone and then wrote the other characters around her. As for the effects , they we're not bad for a low budget but (SPOILER) when Jared Padaleck's cheek is being hallowed out it looks like pie filling. What i loved the most was the music. They had that creepy old music and new songs which does not put you in the 1950's version. All in all all i can say about the movie is that (it's hot), scary and a work of youthful art ..",House of Wax
589,ymel8846,"House of Wax, Not So Hot",5,30 July 2005,"House of Wax is one of those films where the predictability is expected, therefore the goodness of the film heavily relies on it's content and actors,not necessarily it's plot outline. In my opinion, the actor part of it was almost a huge disappointment. Walking into the theater i expected terribly acting by Hilton's part, but of course giving the benefit of the doubt i was willing to consider, of course in the first moments it was obvious that i should've trusted my instincts.Although i may add, admit it! half the people in the theater are there just because Hilton is also there. Nonetheless, i found the villains to be disturbing and psychopathic enough to freak me out a little- but only a little. Overall i found the film to be of average quality, due to its impressive special effects and somewhat intriguing characterization. Unfortunately i found there were more cons then there were pros, with the plot not taken to the fullest of it's potential, some bad casting choices, and of course one of the lamest endings in a horror movie i have seen in a very long time. I'll be nice 5/10 is as far as i'll go, i find that although this film has some intriguing aspects towards it, House of Wax isn't that great at being a scary horror movie, this is definitely not the definition of a great horror flick- in fact Scooby-Doo is probably scarier than this.",House of Wax
590,lh-90138,Excellent,10,29 April 2016,"Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) and her boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki) are going to the big college football game with a group of friends and her brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray). Along the way, they get tired and look for a place to camp out for awhile and get some rest. The film has everything a horror fan like Innovative film, but the performance of Elisha was amazing, she makes the best, although the film is ""notable for having some of the most idiotic protagonists ever to populate a horror movie,"" Cuthbert ""fares the best"" it is an exception. It's hard to find someone as versatile in professional life, it do well in comedies, horror, drama, romance, etc. Invite her to act in this film was the best idea, because not every actress who would do well in the role of Carly The film is hot, sexy, intensely uncomfortable and brings a delicious horror show",House of Wax
591,iheityahu2,This is not a Horror Movie!!,1,7 August 2005,"I didn't think it was possible to be more unimpressed with House Of Wax. I stand corrected! First of all people don't go and see a horror movie only to see people getting killed, cause you can see that in any other movie, but rather to get scared(that's right)!! I saw House Of Wax at 2 am and all I could think about was how much until it ended... everything in this movie was predictable. There where no surprises! This movie couldn't create more than 5 seconds of suspense! This can at most be cataloged as a thriller... If you want a horror movie try The Ring because even if you've seen it before it's a lot better than seeing this for the first time! The whole concept of a house being built 100% out of wax is pretty dumb and not to mention that it's not really that scary... From the moment they say the house is really made of wax I am sure you can guess what's going to happen to it... Totally predictable!! Frankly, I'm surprised that House Of Wax got such a high rating cause I've seen better movies get worse ratings and i don't know why this one got a 5! What a waste of time!",House of Wax

593,lynmariemcg,not bad,6,16 August 2005,"The best thing about this movie is Chad Michael Murray. He is so hot he could melt the House just by looking at it! Apart from him there wasn't much to this. The special effects were cool and I did jump out of my seat about ten times but it couldn't really be classified as a horror. That said I have to admit I did have nightmares that night but I'm putting that down to the amazing job the make-up artists did on Vincent. He was seriously freaky looking! It was kinda hard to believe that Nick and Carly were brother and sister 'cos I kept expecting them to rip each others clothes off. The best death scene was Paris Hilton's, it was by far the most gruesome. I didn't think that she would last that long and she's not that bad an actress really. All in all it wasn't a bad movie and I actually liked it. It's one of those films you go see with a gang of your friends and you shouldn't take it seriously for a minute. The last twist is great and I didn't see it coming.",House of Wax
594,lionafigi,"amazing movie, great story..!",10,16 September 2005,"yes.. i simply loved it, it was pure horror, with a lot of suspense in between, and a lot of powerful scenes, this movie goes all the way to my top 10, in some scenes was breathtaking, and a little choking like when jared's character (wade) was sitting there, all covered in wax, and Dalton starts to peel it off to.. well.. free him.. and we see the flesh under all that wax, and his tears running over it.. and Dalton's saying ""sorry, dude.."" i thought that was a remarkable scene... well, all this to say that this movie is amazing, and whoever like horror movies but with substance, with an amazing story as a background, shouldn't miss it.. it definitely worth it!",House of Wax
595,Flobattersby,Pure Gore!,8,29 September 2005,"When I first heard about ""House Of Wax"" I thought it looked ridiculous because that sort of storyline had never been done before. However when I found out the cast members involved Chad Michael Murray and Paris Hilton, I thought it had to be a must see! The film took me to levels of horror I had never witnessed before and left me gripped throughout the movie. Of course having Paris Hilton in the film there is obviously going to be sexual connotations, which created humour before her amazing death. The movie contains different elements of gore in the sense that the characters' literally get hot burning wax sprayed all over them while they're alive. The storyline in itself is a bit hazy because they build up loads of plots which don't necessarily make sense. For example the mysterious truck driver at the beginning of the film turns out to be a third brother, clearly they added that in in the end because they didn't know how else to link that character into the movie. All in all I really enjoyed ""House Of Wax"" because of the outstanding cast and the different styles of death which are conveyed throughout the film. Go and see it!",House of Wax

597,soul_game,Old School Concepts Meet New Grounds,8,27 October 2005,"Despite debate, I feel this movie is a near-masterpiece. I say near simply because the score of the movie paled in comparison to the film itself, but unlike other movies (like the Ninth Gate) it didn't drag it down. It converges the classic concept of a group of teens stranded in the wilderness along with some classic kills on top of some new age, underrated scenes and kills like macabre scenes with Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson like music playing. Also, I find the characters to be very developed, a lily amongst the thorns in all horror movies. They each have their own deep stories and relations to one another and even the killers. They also have some very smart characters and some VERY menacing slashers. All in all, this movie deserves 8 because it is a rarity in this Dark Age of horror films.",House of Wax

The effects they used in this movie are incredible, the people, dog, and everything made out of wax that was amazing. I really enjoyed this movie in the movie theater because everything seemed so real, but yesterday I bought it at worststore.com and got it for 60% off playing their games. so it all worked out, because I'm not sure if I would want it at full price, hee hee. I know its a remake of an old movie, and I haven't seen that version, can anyone tell me if the old one is better. This movie had all the horror genre stuff, which is my favorite genre. If someone were to come into my tent and scare the s*** out of me, I would probably mention it the next day, I would talk about it for the rest of my life, but not these movies. Also, Paris Hilton turned out to be a pretty good actress, the way she had her head smashed is Oscar worthy.",House of Wax

I must say that I was engrossed from the very beginning and it did not disappoint at all, the special effects were especially good and the film made me jump a good few times. Its a shame that the film got such bad press just because Paris Hilton starred in it, they obviously took a risk casting her but I don't think she let them down in any way. over all I particularly enjoyed it and would recommend it.",House of Wax

602,svag,Waste of Time,3,16 November 2005,"This movie was average. Unfortunately, I will not be able to ever get back the 2 hours of my life that was wasted on this film. If you like horror movies, you should check out The Devil's rejects by Rob Zombie. House of Wax has a few moments where it is entertaining, however over all it's predictable, including the ever-so-cliché ending in the event that there would be room for a sequel. My question would be, ""why bother?"" The acting is only satisfactory, not that anyone actually looks for acting in a horror film, but the acting by Paris Hilton is particularly bad. Fortunately, the is not a lot of actual screen time designated for her. Perhaps you may want to consider one of her lower budget films to be centre of your television screen. The IMDb ratings are this film are even a little high for what the film is actually worth. Should you find that you have 2 hours to kill, have a drink, you're going to need it to get through this film.",House of Wax

604,DamienT98,House of wax...,4,1 December 2005,"I had heard this film wasn't worth watching, but i gave it a chance. Paris Hilton was in it after all! And unfortunately she was the best thing in it. Her acting wasn't too bad either, the rest of the film was as bad as i heard. Interesting twist on the horror genre, but nothing special. The story line was predictable and the characters were not believable enough. I watched the film and didn't care whatsoever if they died or not. It is actually hard to write ten lines on this film. You do get to see Paris in a particle sex scene, and you do see a really well toned ass in a pair of french knickers but it is almost so perfect it makes me think it was a stunt bottom!

605,MentalIdiot210,This movie rocks!,10,3 December 2005,"House of Wax is a remake of the 1953 movie. The best actor in the movie is Chad Michael Murray. Chad plays Nike Jones the twin brother of Carly. In the begging of the movie Nick is the guy you want to hate but you can't because he is so incredibly Hot!!! Towards the middle of the movie he becomes more lovable because he is starting to care more about his sister. But at the end of the movie you absolutely fall in love with him. He saves his sister, and turns out to be a OK guy. They could not have picked anyone better to play this part. Chad brings a sense of caring to the movie. I have seen the movie at least 3 times and the thing that I remember the most is when Nick (Chad) is talking to the killer. He says: ""Vincent, I swear to god if you heart her."" In this sentence he is talking about his sister.This sentence put a lot of weight in the movie, this one line made you believe that he really cares about his sister. The movie rocks,you should defiantly see it.",House of Wax

What started off as filler before some movies I was more interested in either came out for home viewing or were available at the rental place ended up being a highly entertaining flick. Paris Hilton's acting was about as good as can be expected, which is adequate, and she by far has the most boring death, but with that exception being stated, some gnarly bloodshed ensues which had me, a relatively jaded horror aficionado used to the standard issue death scenes, saying ""Damn-that's harsh!"" It's one of those movies that has you (at least I hope I'm not the only one!) putting yourself into the victim's shoes, imagining both their pain and mental desperation. Of course, it didn't get good reviews by more popular raters, but then again, what horror movie EVER has? (Other than in Fangoria magazine...)",House of Wax

I love psychotic horrors, but ones with story lines to go with them - and this one does. There is a nice amount of gore - not too much, but not too little (call me sick, but I like movies with gore in them). And the ending has a twist in it, which may surprise you, but as I don't want to make this comment a spoiler, I will say no more about it.It's a great movie for horror fans, and I actually think it should be an 18 because of the gore and psychopaths - but there is not as much and it is not as disturbing as some 18's, such as Seven.The first time I watched this movie, I was with others, but had I been on my own, I probably would have wet myself!!!!

You can tell from the movie (and if you saw the making-of feature) how much work and energy and money went into making this movie. All of which is ruined by terrible acting, sophomoric characters, and an embarrassing soundtrack. The creators of these movies obviously have a talent for the aesthetic, which they have shown in building an entire town for their set. Why can't they lavish a fraction of this attention on the other elements of film? Like character development, or soundtrack. If they had, this movie could have been a classic, instead of being doomed to be forgotten as yet another ""teen horror flick"" that will not outlive its time. Unless they only wanted to appeal to the teens of today, in which case they hit the nail on the head. Complete with bad humour, silly outfits, and nu-metal. Blech.",House of Wax
610,jefferygavin,Deserves a chance!,8,14 June 2020,"Out of most of the horror movies (especially slashers) that were released in the early 00s, House or Wax is EASILY one of the best.A lot of people had a problem with Paris Hilton being in this movie and to that I have a few things to say: 1. She really isn't in the movie as a main character, she has more of a supporting role 2. Her death scene is easily one of the most fun parts of this movie and 3. She actually did very well in this movie. I know movies like The Hottie and the Nottie gave her acting chops a bad rep, but I think she redeemed herself a lot with this one, especially in her death scene which I'm sure was emotionally and physically demanding. Also, I have to ask; why does everyone hate her so much?? If you see her in interviews, she's actually a lot more down to earth than the charicature of herself that she was forced to play in The Simple Life.Moving on to the rest of the cast, they all did very well. Elisha Cuthbert is as beautiful as always and gives a strong final girl performance that must have taken A LOT of physical work. Chad Michael Murray also did very well in one of his first adult roles after Gilmore Girls and A Cinderella Story. The rest of the supporting cast were also quite good, including Jared Padelecki who gives one of the more memorable performances even though his character doesn't last long.As for the plot, there's not much to say. The plot twists are nothing too special or elaborate but it's still enjoying to watch. I also really appreciate the slow-burning atmosphere of this movie, it feels a lot more intelligent and well put together as compared to some other early 00s horror movies.Overall, House of Wax is a very well made horror film that doesn't do anything revolutionary or Oscar-worthy but it definitely has the potential to go down as a cult classic.",House of Wax
