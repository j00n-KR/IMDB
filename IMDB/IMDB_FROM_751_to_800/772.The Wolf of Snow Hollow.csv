0,nogodnomasters,I got cats at home,8,3 January 2021,"The film takes place in the quiet town of Snow Hollow, Utah. It is a small winter resort. Sheriff John Marshall (Jim Cummings) is a recovering alcoholic with a seventeen year old daughter who doesn't relate to him, and anger management issues. When the first werewolf killing happens, John starts hitting the Listerine.There are a number of deaths and comical investigation as John who is long in the bicuspid, claims there are no such thing as werewolves, while the community is not as certain. The film has a number of things happening in relationships. At times, every line is a gem. John gave his daughter pepper spray as a communion gift. It is just that kind of quirky humor. I was not happy with John's overall downfall.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
1,paul_haakonsen,An interesting take on the werewolf genre...,6,20 October 2020,"Initially, I must admit that I didn't have much of any expectations for the 2020 movie titled ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"". Why? Well, I hadn't heard about it, and usually werewolf movies tend to be dubious.But still, this being a new movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I sat down to watch it. And it being a werewolf movie definitely helped win me over.And I must say that I was actually genuinely entertained by writer and director Jim Cummings's movie. It was a rather well-written storyline that definitely had some good flavor to it, and the plot twist was actually good; I enjoyed the way the storyline panned out, especially since it was built up so that you were expecting it to be the most obvious of choices as to whom was the werewolf in Snow Hollow.The acting performances in ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"" were quite good, and were for the most part done by actors and actresses that I weren't already familiar with. And that is something I enjoy in movies, seeing new and unfamiliar talents whose faces aren't already associated with previously portrayed characters in other movies.The special effects in this movie were actually quite good, taking into consideration that this was not a movie that were heavily reliant on special effects to carry it.I think that ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"" is definitely a worth addition to the werewolf genre, and I can warmly recommend that you watch the movie if you enjoy werewolf movies.My rating of ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"" settles on a well-deserved six out of ten stars.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
2,evanston_dad,Ambitious Horror Comedy,7,27 January 2021,"There's a lot going on thematically in this uneven horror comedy.The film is the brain child of writer/director/star Jim Cummings, whose film ""Thunder Road"" I adored. ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"" isn't as good as that movie, but that's partially because it's more ambitious, so I give him credit for trying.Cummings plays a police officer (again) with rage issues (again) and an alcohol addiction. Gruesome murders start happening in the small Utah town of the film's setting, and after Cummings first rejects the far out theory that they might be the work of a werewolf, he begins to toy with the idea that maybe there's something to it as the murders continue to go unsolved.The werewolf concept acts as an allegory for both the monstrous impulses Cummings himself feels and that he's driven to when drinking, and the predatory world of men in general and the danger they pose to women in general and his teenage daughter specifically. There's clearly a MeToo inspired vein of male apology running through the film, but it all gets a bit muddled by a screenplay that doesn't quite know where it wants to go. The ending is unsatisfying, but the movie leading up to the ending is pretty decent. It doesn't do a great job of striking the right tone -- the humor isn't ever quite funny enough but everything else is treated a bit too lightly to ever be taken seriously -- but the film does have a bold sense of style that I appreciated.I like what I've seen so far of Cummings as an actor and director and this film will keep me coming back for more.Grade: A-",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
3,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Immensely entertaining faux-werewolf entry,10,1 January 2021,"Following a series of grisly murders, the sheriff of a small mountain town begins growing increasingly concerned about his staff's inability to catch the killer as he believes it's a human while the rest believe the growing reports of it being a werewolf, and must try to keep his composure long enough to stop whoever's responsible.This was quite an enjoyable werewolf effort. One of the strongest aspects to be had here is how this one plays with a common trope of the mystery investigation and integrating it into a werewolf film. The fact that this is quite a complex setup, from the town sheriff who's too old to be going through this kind of investigation but doing so just because it's the job to the younger generation who's far less concerned with doing actual work in favor of enjoying the benefits of the job so that when the time comes they're woefully underprepared. Coupled with the strong subplots about the inability to recognize the obvious about the crimes to the overwhelmed nature of the job and his stress at not finding the killer, this one comes off rather well in that regard. There's also a lot to like with the build-up from this setup to the central premise involving the investigation of the attacks. Focusing on the growing exasperation at not finding the killer, the series of deductive reasoning that they use to piece together what's going on ranges from the interviews they conduct to the clues found at the individual crime scenes including the destroyed deer carcass, the mangled bodies of the victims left behind and the anecdotal pieces that are found, there's a wholly engrossing mystery about the killer's identity and eventually reveal that comes as a nice surprise. Overall, this all makes for a really fun and well-handled mystery which is certainly a crucial part of the film. Still, to be a good genre entry a film needs to have good werewolf action and this one delivers solidly on that front. The opening attack which sets this in motion is quite brutal and chilling with the suddenness of the attack and the gory aftermath, much like the other attacks shown which offer up a nice mixture of the suspenseful stalking and interaction with the creature. That leaves the encounter on the highway or the confrontation with the daughter in her boyfriends' car as exceptionally fun with the film working well to keep the werewolf to the shadows for these scenes and only giving the aftermath to know what it's capable of. Given the nature of its later reveals, this all works as well as it can making this one incredibly enjoyable to hold out over its problematic aspects. There isn't much wrong to be had here but it does have some flaws. The main drawback to be had with this is the overall weak ending that deprives it of some general fun as it takes away the coolness of the concept for something far less interesting. Giving the actual motivation and identity of the strange beast involved in the kills is a huge misstep that is done superficially without much impact and then turned into a half-hearted redemption angle rather than working with a creative concept that was working exceptionally well beforehand. As well, that also manages to highlight a lot of the brief looks at the creature where it doesn't get a chance to showcase a spectacular design for more than a few fleeting glimpses, making for the only aspects that drag this one down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
4,deloudelouvain,Entertaining and well shot.,7,12 November 2020,"What I can say is that I did enjoy this movie. The Wolf Of Snow Hollow is entertaining, mostly due to its fast pace what results in that you never have a boring moment. The acting from the whole cast was good so no complaints about that either. I'm not sure if the comedy parts were really necessary, to me it could just have been a good thriller with some gore. The cinematography was good with clear well shot images. Good job from director/writer/actor Jim Cummings.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
5,ksf-2,is it a wolf... or just some people yelling?,6,3 March 2021,"Written by, directed by, and.... starring Jim Cummings. He's John Marshall, taking care of his daughter and his sickly father. VERY mysterious, foreboding music at the beginning. when violent murders occur on the full moons, they realize things are way messed up in this town. Marshall seems to be under huge stress from all directions. his family life is messed up, and he's yelling at everyone all the time. constantly. gets annoying after a while. they realize it's some sort of very large canine. then they decide it's just a large man. then, who know? occasionally, there's some dry humor (when he's not yelling). and there aren't ever any witnesses; they only find the ripped-apart remains. Marshall is coming totally apart. too drunk to attend his AA meeting. can he resolve ANY of these issues?? it's not bad. if you turn down the volume during all the yelling. Jim Cummings was also a cop in Thunder Road... seems to be a theme.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
6,westsideschl,Dumb,3,29 March 2021,I don't know which was dumber the cops; the inability of victims to disable the wolf; or the wolf itself. Seemed like a cheap production especially with the lack of acting & dialogue relatable to sixth graders.,The Wolf of Snow Hollow
7,ops-52535,have a hang to black comedy... and will have a gory pretaste on christmas,9,10 October 2020,"Then this is a fantastic made , produced, acted and funny directed film , that seems to come out of nowhere in a hollow trench of snow upsomewhere in the god forbidden isolated state of utahhta-ta-ra-ta, in the beautiful, strong and great united states of america where it blows so much from right and left that it wakes the disturbed werewolves among us , hungry and with great lust for a snatch of female flesh under a fullmoon sky of blistering cold winterland...so its a film crampacked of strange caracters with strange visions of life and death and its causes and where the sheriffs son said common''lets do the twist again, like we did last summer''.just a little precautious warning, its a bloody and gory flick, so its not for the kids in the cradle to view, apart from that ,have a good laugh, best regards the grumpy old man",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
8,paulclaassen,They're going to trick you on this one...,4,28 September 2021,"The peaceful existence in the small town of Snow Hollow is shattered after a brutal murder. While some residents believe it to be ""an animal"", the town's sheriff John Marshall (played by writer/director Jim Cummings) believes it to be the work of a serial killer. 'The Wolf of Snow Hollow' features an unusual blend of humor and horror, which doesn't blend all that well for me. This would have worked better as a full-on comedy, or horror. There's just too much humor for it to be taken seriously.Robert Foster is a good actor, but his character doesn't really serve a purpose here. He doesn't contribute to the film in any way, apart from sheriff John always arguing and disagreeing with him - for the humor element. There is no need for this character.The film dishes up some truly creepy moments, but - as mentioned - they would have been more effective had it not been for all the comedy. This is not the most interesting werewolf movie I've seen, and by the time the film ends, you'll notice you've been tricked anyway. With the twist reveal, a lot in the movie wasn't possible, deeming this a werewolf movie I won't be watching again, regardless of how different and stylish it is...Would I watch it again? No.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
9,imseeg,"No real surprises, but a decent and enjoyable werewolf flick.",7,12 May 2021,"Not terrific, but a really decent werewolf flick, with good acting.The story: a wild monster (or is it a human?) kills innocent women in a small American town. Will they catch the monster?Yes, this story sounds silly, but all monster stories do sound silly, but as far as werewolf movies go, this one is quite a good one, although nothing original.The good: this movie was in memory of Robert Foster, who got famous with his role in ""Jackie Brown"" by Quentin Tarantino. This was his last role and in whatever movie he had played in before, Robert Foster always had such an overwhelming charisma that I always wondered why he didnt often star in bigger movies. I will still enjoy his many great performances of the past...",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
10,jtindahouse,A unique brand of humour that won't be for everyone,6,9 January 2021,"I only discovered Robert Forster late in his career but I'm certainly glad I did. The man had a terrific screen presence and a wonderfully soothing manner and voice to watch. This was his final film, and while perhaps not his most iconic of roles, it was a solid note to end things on. 'The Wolf of Snow Hollow' was a little bit different to what I expected going in, and while I didn't always connect with it, it had some elements to it that I really liked.This was my first introduction to Jim Cummings. I haven't seen his first film 'Thunder Road', although I will likely track it down at some point. I can understand why some people have become big fans of him, but his humour just wasn't really to my liking unfortunately. It's that sort of humour where you think to yourself ""that was funny"" rather than actually laughing - if that makes sense.I liked the direction the film went in the end. I would've liked a little more focus on the story and a little less on the characters throughout however. It was only a short film at 84 minutes but my attention did still drift away quite often. I liked 'The Wolf if Snow Hollow' without ever loving it. If the humour seems up your alley then give it a look. Otherwise you'll be fine without it.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
11,jadavix,"Good, could have been better",7,30 December 2020,"I wanted to like ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"" more than I did. It has a lot to like, such as direction, effects, and performances from some of the actors, including an under-utilised Robert Forster.The problem is that the movie lost my interest too many times. I also was not a fan of the guy who played the protagonist - Forster would have done a much better job, if they had made the character older. The ending twist didn't seem to have much to do with what came before it, and seemed tacked on to provide an ending.Riki Lindholme gives what should be a star-making turn here as the police character you really root for, instead of the actual protagonist. I know it is unlikely she'll be fronting too many movies, but hopefully there'll be more strong supporting roles for her in movies to come.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
12,kevin_robbins,This is also one of those movie you watch once and probably don't need to see again,6,8 May 2021,"The Wolf of Snow Hollow (2020) is a movie we recently rented off Amazon Prime for $5.99. The movie focuses on a recovering police officer who is super stressed out and appears to have a werewolf serial killer in his little town. While he tries to convince everyone it's a man the body count racks up. This movie is directed by and stars Jim Cummings (Thunder Road) and was made on a $2,000,000 budget. This movie also stars Robert Forster (Jackie Brown), Riki Lindhome (Last House on the Left) and Chloe East. The storyline for this is actually very interesting and comes together pretty well. I loved the CGI for the werewolf and the ultimate evolution of that character and the self dialogue of the main character was hilarious at times. I did want a little more from this film in terms of action rather than the over dedication to the police officer's self reflection. This is a fun and unique film but far from perfect. This is also one of those movie you watch once and probably don't need to see again. I'd give it a solid 6/10.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
13,injury-65447,The main character doesn't work!,5,12 October 2020,"The main character of the film just comes across as goofy and awkward. I don't understand the point of him or his relationships with the residents of the town. He is completely unlikeable and comes across as an a hole. Jim Cummings is a very handsome man but his acting here, his portrayal of this character tonally, just doesn't add up. It's a big miss. A big mess.For a horror comedy I found this film to be neither scary nor funny. There are moments in the film which I feel like are supposed to be comedic but the laughter just wasn't coming. It's a bit try hard. A real shame for me because I thought the trailer was very promising and I was excited to see it. Quite a let down.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

Cinematography, script, direction, acting- all great.

19,s3276169,Sinks under its own weight.....,5,11 October 2020,"Odd ball, quirky, opinionated....some of the terms I'd use to describe ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow.This film tries to create a subtly eccentric, strangely humorous vibe. Its expressed, in large part, through an odd ball Sheriff who, already carrying considerable personal baggage on his back, is suddenly tasked with solving a series of gruesome and bizarre murders. Indeed, the whole affair is presented as a ""bloody comedy of errors"". Regrettably, its consistent lack of well thought through ideas and contextual bridges, see's the whole thing slowly sink, under its own weight.The films cause is not helped one bit by its rather opinionated attitude towards men either. Lazy, lacklustre, incompetent, reckless and uncaring. A few words that sum up the attitude towards the majority of male characters in this tale. One highlight is the Sheriff's horny daughter, sneaking out for a rendezvous with her boyfriend, in full knowledge of the curfew imposed by her father, the Sheriff, to keep people safe. She's then almost murdered by the killer but promptly blames her father for not caring, when he saves her. Its illogical nonsense like this, that further undermines this already conflicted effort.By the end I was left feeling depressed, irritated and puzzled by this odd little film. The only real upside being the consistently solid acting from the cast and some moderately watchable, if predictable, horror sequences.5/10.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
20,valleyjohn,Worth watching for Jim Cummings alone,7,11 November 2021,"I like Jim Cummings - I like him a lot . The first time I came across him was in the film Thunder Road which he also wrote , starred in and directed , just like this film .He's quirky and highly watchable but most of all , he's bloody funny . He reminds me a lot of The Evil Dead's Bruce Campbell.Terror grips a small mountain town as bodies are discovered after each full moon. Losing sleep, raising a teenage daughter, and caring for his ailing father, officer Marshall struggles to remind himself there's no such thing as werewolves.The film itself is pretty good . It's funny as well as having a serious side but never too serious .The way Jim Cummings plays the stressed out cop John Marshall is brilliant. In fact not too far from the same charter played in road .He plays chaos perfectly.The story is different . Some would say a little silly but that didn't bother me . You never know if it's a supernatural or not . The conclusion was interesting . Look out for Chloe East who plays John's Daughter - 🔥🔥🔥Sadly this was released a year after Robert Forster died . It's a shame we won't see him on the big screen ever again. .",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
21,begob,Rage against the dying,7,28 October 2021,"When the snow of a small town is stained by the blood of female victims, the deputy sheriff finds his hands full with rumours of a lycanthrope ...Witty, fast-paced satire of law enforcement in a rural community. The dialogue is sharp and comes at you hard with rapid editing of short scenes. The performances are excellent, the lead channeling Jim Carey while his sidekick provides contrast in her observant meekness. Oddly, we get a lot of interesting detail on the second victim - but then she's gone, and it's as if the writer/director has fooled us. He certainly can write dialogue and character, but I wonder if sometimes that talent is misapplied.The theme is control of male rage, set in an early scene through a conflict between a visitor and a local, carried through obviously in the killings, and embodied in the hero's personal struggles with a broken family and alcohol abuse. In the first AA meeting there's a clever bit of dialogue, where the hero talks about the monster within while getting steadily distracted by mysterious footsteps from the floor above, and it seems like a serious horror vibe is about to grow. But, in the end, the rage remains and the resolution is a shallow defeat, so the theme doesn't get a full treatment. Maybe that's because the hectic pace leads to rushing the story when a little patience might have yielded more from the excellent set up.Cinematography is top quality, and the music too - although a bit arch at the scene of the third killing. I also like the trick used efficiently a few times of an off-camera sound that implies some character action to which the character in frame reacts. Good example is the cut to a scene where the hero, while protesting the refusal to let him enter an AA meeting, jabs his finger at some unseen dude, which causes a chair to be thrust back over the floor, which causes the hero to back off and walk away.The ultimate weakness is that the villain's mission is out of left field and doesn't feel integrated with the lives of the characters. I'm not saying the reveal is Scooby Doo, but it's not too far off. In fact, there is a Silence of the Lambs vibe when the hero twigs the villain's identity, but in that movie the villain was introduced in all his grisly glory early on, and the plot engine relied on the discrepancy between a false trail and the actual destination.Overall: Lively and witty, but probably needed a bit of meditation on the depth that real horror generates.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

33,ofumalow,"Fun, but still a letdown",6,16 April 2021,"""Thunder Road"" was such an unexpected delight that I'm willing to go easy on Cummings for having something of a sophomore slump. This shows all signs of being rushed to capitalize on that modest success, as it basically just reprises the same character with some (but not enough) variations in a more genre-oriented story. The problem is that ""Road"" was entirely built around his over-the-top character, which was excessive in (almost always) good ways, whereas this time that character's tantrums, childishness, et al. Are less funny, and eat up screentime that would have been better spent fleshing out the horror aspects that instead go underdeveloped. So even as a comedy horror (though the horror isn't exactly comic, and there's no real satire here), the film is imbalanced by too much attention given to a star role that's too close to Cummings' prior one, and which isn't at all usefully integrated into the genre-focused plot. Still, he has some filmmaking chops and an interesting sensibility that keep this entertaining, though hopefully his next feature will be better thought out.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

The dark and dry humor was surprisingly funny. The pacing was great with fun small town characters. The highlight of this film was really Robert Forster, he really steals the show. The dialogue between him and his son was fantastic, as the aging sherif whose health is declining but who is unwilling to admit it. The slow melt down of Jim Cummings character was great as well. I not only felt great empathy for him, but I actually thought he could be the killer! That is some good writing. The dark snowy scenery added a nice element as well...kind of like the icing on the cake....I think this is worth seeing, but I'm quirky like that.I even liked the condom ending with a pause.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
37,whitemanfromtowne,Gems like these come far and few.,8,11 October 2020,"Gems like these come far and few. They're simply not making films that are watchable to the end without insulting the viewing audience intelligence. A dark comedy thriller with a well knit cast, plot and climax. Very rare in today's market of sex, political correctness and cgi nonsense. A definite must watch for movie goers who appreciate a good story build up. Will be watching again sometime in the distant future. All the hate on the film are coming from silly douchebags",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
38,SnobReviews,An entertaining and bloody ride.,7,14 October 2020,"Bloody fun, well written and often hilarious; ""The Wolf Of Snow Hollow"" proves that actor/writer/director Jim Cummings can tackle any genre you throw his way.In this comedy-horror film, terror strikes a small mountain town as bodies are discovered after each full moon.An incredibly original take on the genre makes ""The Wolf Of Snow Hollow"" one to watch. I now look forward to Jim Cummings' next project to see what he can do. If you haven't seen his debut comedy/drama film, ""Thunder Road"", please see it. This was Robert Forster's final film and I think he'd be proud of the outcome. Running at almost 90-minutes, this film has enough blood, gore and laughs to play around with. I found myself laughing so hard at instances and shocked in others. All around great and fun film that is sure to keep you hooked.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
39,fluffchop,Riki Lindhome is lovely,7,12 May 2021,"I like her and was pleased when I saw her in this. The main Sheriff guy is an idiot who made every scene uncomfortable to watch. She tells him to start acting like a Sheriff, classic. A powder keg like him shouldn't be allowed anywhere near law enforcement but it's so often the case that these types are more common than not. Anger issues, alcoholism and being a bully? Welcome aboard you're fully qualified to be a cop. The stupid moose that attacks everyone couldn't have been a guy in a costume but that's how it played out in the end. An enjoyable movie up until they reveal this guy in a costume BS at the end.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
40,fciocca,Halfway between a parody and an investigation flick. Very bad acting and predictable story,3,7 June 2021,"The main issue with ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"" is the lack of direction: is it a horror parody? Is it an investigation story? The movie feels very disjointed and I could not understand what the director wanted to do. Cummings cannot act at all, and even if this was made on purpose, he is still extremely annoying, he is always over the top. Except for Detective Julia Robson, the rest of the cast was very disappointing. The story feels very disjointed and does not make any sense. Elements concerning the investigation does not match very well. The fact that you are making a ""funny"" movie does not authorize to write a plot that makes no sense at all. It feels like the script was written on a rush and nobody revised it before starting filming.Whoever edited, clearly does not know how to mix music and dialogues. In fact the soundtrack was so high in some scenes that I could not properly understand what actors were saying. The photography is very bland and repetitive, there is no creativity whatsoever, and the color grading is completely flat. Special effects were astonishing, considering that this movie was not backed up by a big budget. But honestly this is the only positive thing. It could have been a nice and funny flick, if only they cared more about details and they were able to release a cohesive vision of this small project. I am pretty sure that it could have been a small hit in the indie environment, mocking all these mystery movies set in a mountain town. A real wasted potential.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

To be fair, this is quite a bit mkre ambitious then that. There's more characters, more plot, visual effects, the whole nine yards. Mostly it's surprisingly well handled. The cinematography is solid, the performances are good, and the dark comedy us good.
I liked the juxtaposition between that and the gruesome subject matter. What elevates this above the typical murder mystery, police drama is the character work.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

44,noahgibbobaker,Classic thriller modernised.,7,24 January 2021,"Yet another great film released in 2020.This film is a little cheesy, has a couple poor performances and there's some bad exposition... but it's still a great movie. It's one of the funniest films of the year, It's an interesting take on the slasher genre, something that I'm usually not into, and even though I mentioned a couple bad performances, the rest are nuanced and really great.Jim Cummings (writer, director and star) is brilliant, the way he held his mouth open when he wasn't talking added a lot to his character look and shows impressive attention to detail. Riki Lindhome and the late Robert Forster were pretty great as well. A few great films have come out this year with cast or crew who have since died, or had died even before the release.
Anyway worse performances are by Annie Hamilton and Hannah Elder, this might be in part down to their characters being less interesting than most others. I really enjoyed the characters for the most part, they're not all that well defined and make unreasonable decisions occasionally but I did really care for them.I'm going to do a recurring bit in all of my reviews where I talk about the music. I love music and not to toot my own horn.... as nobody says, I'd say I know a lot about it too. So, the music in the wolf of snow hollow is pretty great, composer Ben Lovett is really good at creating an uncertain atmosphere, I think this is his best score yet. He wanted to create something like ""Bernard Herrmann with no money"", not something like taxi driver or citizen Kane, but something like Psycho, a classic low budget classic hollywood mystery/thriller score but with extra minute details to pick up on to give the film a sonic personality and a characteristic that you may not have anticipated. The brooding string and sad alcoholic yet simultaneously epic almost scary brass give this effect perfectly.Also I so liked the cinematography by Natalie Kingston, the opening credits are stunning.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
45,MikesIDhasbeentaken,"quite a mess, but watchable",5,16 December 2020,"The bad; Main guy, writer director actor... i don't know what he was going for, like he changed his mind while they were making it if he was making a comedy, drama, horror, and this shows in the movie in general but his charactor is all over the place, it doesn't help that he can't act at all and stands out anyway, but it's just a complete mess
The movie snips and snaps to different scenes quickly and not necessarily in time order, if done well this could have been good but it just makes the whole film more messy and frustrating to watchThe good; kind of good premise, location, enough to keep you watching to the end and when the credits roll you don't feel that it was a complete waste of time despite the many negatives.a watchable mess of a movie, main guy should def stop acting, maybe directing too. writing was ok in part just not consistant",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
46,TheCorniestLemur,Awoooooooo,8,13 May 2021,"Oooooooh this guy has my attention.There certainly aren't many directors that can make a genuinely funny horror comedy, and even less on such a small budget, and even less that are also talented enough to play the lead role and have it not feel like a big ego projection, but you did it, Jim Cummings.And it even manages to feel like an original werewolf film, being mainly about stress and even possibly a commentary on how the police don't actually protect people all that often.I mentioned that Jim Cummings actually felt natural and cast himself very well in the lead role, but all the rest of the casting is just as good and everyone here gives great performances, even if they don't really have as much of a chance to shine.Really this entire review is just an excuse to jerk him off, because as well as his amazing performance, this is directed, shot, and edited so damn well that if A24 aren't aware of this guy, they really should be, cause he is a perfect fit into the little stable they've been assembling of prize-winning stallion directors.Especially because a lot of them seem to have made an art form in and of itself of twisting the tone all over the place while having it still feel consistent, and this film is another one that has a habit of doing that.The only thing I would seriously whine about is that right up until the end I was really liking the story and where it was going...and then it kind of turns into an episode of Scooby-Doo. If you've seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about, and some might find it funny but I thought it was bloody dumb.Still, this is definitely worth a watch, especially on a snowy night in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere...if that's a possible arrangement for you.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
47,tmccull52,I've Seen Worse...,5,28 October 2020,"This movie reminded somewhat of the 1974 made-for-television movie, ""Scream of the Wolf"". A small rural community is plagued by a series of savage murders that some locals begin to attribute to a werewolf. There were no comedic elements to ""Scream of the Wolf"", however.I'd read both positive and negative reviews about this movie before watching it, and after having seen it, I can see points made for either case. I'm a sucker for werewolf movies, and so I did harbor at least some measure of high hopes for this movie. On the whole, however, ""Scream of the Wolf"" took the same basic premise and did a better job with it 46 years ago.In the case of both movies, the killer turned out to be human, and not a were old. In ""Scream of the Wolf"", the killer turned out to be a big game hunter who had been called in to track down the murderous beast. In ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"", the killer turns out to be the reclusive local taxidermist.In both movies, the actual killer turned out to be unusually tall and strong. In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, the epitome of the tall, burly character actor was Clint Walker, who stood in the area of 6' 6"" and weighed somewhere around 250 to 260 pounds. The taxidermist in the ""Snow Falls"" movie looks to be a bit taller than Clint Walker was, but he isn't as heavily built.Being as I was hoping that the killer was an actual werewolf in the case of both movies, I was let down by the ending of each. Both are okay, and worth a watch, if you can view them for free.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

50,manuelasaez,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie,8,10 October 2020,"I usually really dislike horror/comedies for the simple fact that they usually fail at doing both. Meaning, they are never really funny are are often never scary. This movie, however, does both equally well, and works as either simply just a scary comedy or a funny horror film. I didn't expect to laugh out loud so often, especially hearing some of the tirades that the main character shouted throughout most of the movie. It really tells you a lot about an actor when they can be both serious and comedic without resorting to cheap, cliched one-liners.The best part about this movie is that everything is unexpected. You think you know where the story is headed but in the end, every element just comes together without the need for a lengthy exposition by some background character. The story just builds organically, and you are left satisfied and longing for more.I enjoyed every second of this film.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

As a writer/director/actor, I hope to see more of Jim Cummings in the future, but if he's going to fail at two of those, please keep writing!I love Riki Lindhome, and have followed her since BBT. This is her best, absolute best, acting since the sitcom. Personally, I'm grateful she has all of her clothes on, as I just got burned again purchasing a 2018 movie with her in it where she, uh, doesn't. That, coupled with another image of her having sex while texting... I'm no prude, but sometimes you just wince. But she is AWESOME in this movie!

They are constantly engaging and compelling to watch.

The movie does not play fairly here and provides misinformation that cannot be reconciled with the ending.I enjoyed the analogy between alcoholism and werewolves.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
55,nashw82,Not perfect but entertaining,7,27 November 2020,"This is a solid little horror/creature feature, but the only issues was that I was never sure what it was trying to be. Some of the performances and the characters are over the top and give the impression that it's trying to be a horror comedy, but the some of the subjects and actions are too serious for it to be funny.
A small town police man is dealing with his divorce, his teenage daughter, his recovery from alcoholism, and the failing health of his stubborn father who also happens to be the sheriff.
If that isn't enough, people start being brutally killed in this sleepy mountain town, and some of the signs point to wolves... or possibly a werewolf. As the killings continue and the police get no closer to catching the killer, the townspeople start to turn against the police department which just exacerbates of all the above mentioned issues.
It's well made, it looks slick, the special effects are mostly practical and we slowly see more of the creature as the film progresses which helps to build the suspense regarding who or what the real killer is. I had to watch it a second time to pick up the clues that led to the conclusion, and it held up okay on this second viewing. It's not perfect but its a fun watch, and possibly suitable for teens who are starting to get into horror.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

57,theredsky,The Wolf of Snow Hollow Review,8,18 October 2020,"I was interested in this because I had heard that the Director's, Jim Cummings, first and only other film, Thunder Road, was really good. After watching this film, I'm very excited to see where this Director goes in the future. The Wolf of Snow Hollow is a surprisingly funny and emotional film that is able to mix its horror elements, dramatic elements, and comedic elements almost perfectly together. I never felt as if a scene was undercut by a comedic line or anything else. Some of the jokes may not have been super funny but a lot of them definitely got a laugh out of me. The horror elements weren't drop dead terrifying but they had a lot of tension and build up that made those scary moments effective and the dramatic elements hit really hard at points. Mainly with Robert Forster's character but I think that's because he passed away this time last year so it does feel a little somber. All of the performances here are great especially Forster and Jim Cummings. Each of their characters are mesmerizing and so fun to watch interact with everyone else. The script, also written by Jim Cummings, is great too and makes it easier for those elements to hit. On a technical level, the film has great editing, cinematography, and music. There are issues with pacing at points but it isn't too major and the occasional unfunny joke or weak element doesn't take away from the experience too much. If you are a fan of unique horror films or want a funny comedy horror film, then go check this out when you can.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

It's a small-scale, simple, low-budget, contained, morbid dark comedy that doesn't take itself that seriously.What they do with the werewolf is very odd and humorous.There are scenes that are legitimately creepy.The characters are likable and interesting.All of the acting is great, especially from Jim Cummings and Robert Forster. (May he Rest In Peace! He was awesome!)The violence is effective.The comedy is very funny.It feels low-budget but it does a lot with what little it has.You don't feel the runtime at all! It's over 80 minutes but it feels like an hour. I watched this movie twice in a row I enjoyed it so much.It's very well-shot!It has a great sense of atmosphere!The location they picked for this story really adds to the experience.The dialogue is very well-written!The cast is great!There are scenes that are very stressful, too. The editing and music helps with this quite a bit.There are some moments that are cheesy and tropy, but since the movie doesn't take itself that seriously it's forgivable.Go see it! It's most definitely one of the better movies to come out this year and I'm looking forward to whatever movie Jim Cummings makes next.

62,tresm87,Another mediocre and botched attempt at a modern werewolf story that ends up being a total/tonal mess.,3,14 November 2020,"In my opinion there still hasn't been a truly great werewolf film, though I'm always holding out hope for one to come. Some have been passable, but most have been complete and utter misfires that can't capture the age old tale. Whether it's the overall story, the tonal clashings, or the effects of the actual creature, it seems like something that should've been accomplished by now. As far as this film goes, it's an embarrassing attempt that is downright amateur in every facet.What starts out as a promising opening unravels with awful forced humor that falls flat every time. There's horrendous acting from all involved, and mainly the lead actor who's also the writer/director which is even worse. There's oddly placed music choices throughout killing tones all over during scenes that don't need it . The horror aspects are virtually non existent aside from 3 20 second scenes and that's literally it. The conclusion is pitiful attempt at a twist that renders the whole already mediocre story useless.Overall this is probably one of the worst films I've seen all year and a complete waste of time even when it's good just having something new to watch right now. It's probably the worst werewolf themed film I've seen.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
63,pangipingu,Somewhat Disappointed,6,8 November 2020,"To those who've not watched Jim Cummings' debut feature ""Thunder Road"", his latest Fargoesque comic thriller may seem brilliant. Though, my expectations as an avid follower of this young director were much higher than what I saw. Cummings' characterization of the protagonist, John Marshall, was too similar to Thunder Road's Jim Arnaud. Actually, that was the main destructive element in the whole movie. Nonetheless, ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"" is worth a watch and definitely exceeds most of the recent trashy pictures that come out of Hollywood.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
64,BeanieCore,"A confused, mediocre effort.",5,22 January 2021,"More werewolf films are always welcome, in my humble opinion. Even better are werewolf films that attempt to do something different with the formula, and ""The Wolf Of Snow Hollow"" most certainly does that. Whether or not I found it entirely successful is another story. It's the sophomore effort by director/writer/actor/producer Jim Cummings, and is obviously a labor of love for him. But having himself front and center, involved in every aspect of the film may have allowed him to over-indulge just a bit. There's sort of a ""Fargo"" meets ""The Wolf Man"" vibe happening here, but the humor is very dark. It focuses more-so on drama than anything else, although it's more horrific scenes certainly qualify as horror. The effects for the titular werewolf are very good, though only briefly glimpsed. Despite this, I believe the attack scenes could have been filmed much more effectively.Herein lies one of the film's greatest problems. Cummings has an erratic directorial style, which moves from quiet drama and rambunctious comedy, to slow-moving suspense without much of a chance to develop atmosphere or character. This is the story of a man struggling to overcome his alcoholism and protect his family, yet he never becomes a full character. We see him shout, tirade and relapse, but we never glean any insight as to why he behaves this way. Therein further, is another issue. Cummings is simply not a good actor. He overacts at all times, and his presence is simply without a trace of charm. He puts himself front and center, and he simply cannot carry the film with his hammy, at times almost operatic gusto. Lastly, there's a ""twist"" ending that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the plotline, and carries no significance. It's actually quite a thinly written film, mostly the story of an unlikeable man's struggles, that we cannot relate to as an audience, when not given the chance to know him. It could've been something special, but alas, just another disappointing lycanthrope flick.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

I much preferred the likes of Silver Bullet and especially Late Phases.Aside from the irritating, frequently yelling lead, the characters are good and the acting is solid and overall it's a very well made film.

67,RMurray847,A singular and odd little movie,6,11 February 2021,"WOLF OF SNOW HOLLOW is a difficult film to describe in a meaningful way. Yes, on the surface, it's a werewolf movie. A small town, with an understaffed and undertrained police force, is forced to contend with a supernatural killer. Can the committed but anger-management challenged sheriff (Jim Cummings) coral his team long enough to track down the creature?It's a horror movie, yes. But really, it's not that terribly scary. It isn't horrifically gory (but it's a little gory), so you don't have that guilty pleasure. It's also a comedy (surprise!), but not quite a knee-slapper. It isn't a parody movie in the vein of SCARY MOVIE; it mines most of its humor in the bumbling antics of the police and other townspeople.None of this sounds like a recipe for a very successful movie, and yet there is something about WOLF OF SNOW HOLLOW. Writer/director/star Jim Cummings is a singular filmmaker. He's created a cop-hero who is far from ordinary. He wants to do a good job, but is nearly crippled by either self-doubt/self-loathing or by his own incredibly loose cannon temper. His father, also in law enforcement (and well played by Robert Forster in one of his final roles), counsels him repeatedly, but Cummings is a mess. It's a very interesting and unusual characterization; one that actually feels fresh and surprising. His fellow cops are loyal to him (even the ones smart enough to see his flaws and worry), but he even struggles to see that his peers are on his side and not working against him. The werewolf is almost an externalization of the lycanthrope within him. (Although, to be sure, the movie is not as psychologically heavy as what I just described!). So we watch the movie rooting more for this flawed guy to get his act together rather than to see the werewolf tracked down.Cummings is ably supported by Forster and by Riki Lindhome, a promising and smart detective who also very much has Cumming's back.The movie moves at a brisk pace, which is good, since what it doesn't have is a lot of tension. Even though the cops are bungling, we always assume they'll ""get their werewolf."" Most characters are not terribly well developed and we don't invest much emotionally into what the creature is doing to the town.Really, in the end, it's just an odd, quirky, singular little film that I enjoyed probably more than I should have. Tough to describe, and difficult to recommend to just anybody, I'm still very glad I saw it. I'll certainly be checking out Cumming's previous effort THUNDER ROAD, and probably anything new he comes up with.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
68,mvike,WANTED to love it..,5,1 November 2020,"I'll be honest & say I wanted this to be so great. Werewolves are undoubtedly my all time favorite monster... if you love them as well, you are painfully aware how rare it is the movies get made now, & even less rare that they are even OK, let alone good or better...That said, I tried so hard to make excuses everytime my mind said ""this sorta sucks.."" but in the end..I had to face reality.It wasn't that good. The pacing & tone were almost dreamlike, & not in a good, nor intentional way. The movie cuts randomly from attack scenes to scenes hours later. The father/Sheriff was just ...he was too weirdly written (not the actors fault I don't think) it felt as if he was supposed to be seen as kind of an incompetent goof...? But also not...? Every scene he is in is bizarre, because almost every line feels like it could've meant to be a joke, but nothing at all done in a joking fashion. This only happened with him, no one else. Everyone else was played very straight, but he was this 'out of his element' goof even in the most serious of scenes...it just came across as too weird for me.The werewolf - the times we see it, it's great. Which isnt often but it's good enough...but with the twist (which I saw a mile away) it leaves obvious plot holes..At the end I'll give my biggest issues, for now... here's how I'd rate it:Story: 6/10 (done to death, but it was fine)
Acting: 7/10
Cinematography/Quality: 10/10
Horror: 4/10
Comedy: 2/10Overall, if you just love horror...I could see you hating this. If you love werewolves though, you may enjoy it.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!The wolf turns out to be this somewhat random, very tall, thin man. He just wears a wolf skin basically, okay.. fine... but the police got reports back saying the victims were CLEARLY attacked by a large WOLF... due to the wounds, & bites. These people do this as a career, they aren't going to mistake some knife/weapon for a specific animals teeth. That's giving the film extra credit because we aren't even explained how he did inflict these wolf like injuries. So..How did the victims have clear animal injuries?How did the man vocalize very distinct wolf howls?How was it the only man in this SMALL TOWN who is around 7'0+ tall able to evade being any sort of real suspect, when the only lead anyone had to really go on was that the suspect was VERY LARGE?Why was he cutting off specific organs/parts of people? They made this kind of a big thing, then I didn't see it explained.How was this man (who was in no way muscular or powerful looking) while donning a wolf costume able to generate enough speed & power to ram into a TRUCK DOOR, &
Cause it to lift several feet into the air. Then punch through a window of it no problem, then evade the Sheriff firing shotgun blasts... while leaping from car to car, & escape?I see those as not just questions unanswered, but loop holes generated by having it be a human.Also, what's the drinking deal? Never explained.It almost feels rushed, or like many people made the film instead of one vision.I wanted badly to love it, I ended up pretty let down... will never watch it again, but not sorry that I saw it. It was ok.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

70,ryanpersaud-59415,"The Good, Good Wolf",9,4 May 2021,"The Good: I love this movie. It manages to balance its tone so perfectly through a mix of snappy dialog, brilliant editing, fully realized characters and genuinely scary moments. It doesn't feel like a cliché small town ""procedural"", ala The Outsider or The Killing or...like, all of them, really. This movie not only manages to balance all of these spinning plates, but has something to say about policing and the role of police in society. Dang.Cummings is amazing here. His character is so well conveyed that you know exactly how he will react in almost every situation. His performance is pitch perfect. Really, everyone is good here and I think a lot of it has to do with the tight script. Pacing is also excellent, with this relatively short movie feeling like so much as happened over that period of time. Cherry on top? The gorgeous snowy vistas really drive home the ""fairy tale"" vibe the movie goes for as well.This movie is wholly unique and is probably the best horror comedy I have seen in a long time, which is saying a lot considering how many good ones are out there.The Bad: okay, so....let's get this out of the way. There was no werewolf all along. It was just an exceedingly creepy, tall and strong man who likes to dress up as a wolf. It's nice to see the protagonist vindicated, but unfortunately, it leads to a lot of plot holes and conveniences. How could this guy have left canine teeth marks on the body? How could he have seen in that suit? Why did his legs look wolf-like and not human like? So many stupid questions now have to be asked. If they just kept him as the Big Bad Wolf, I think more people would give this movie the rating it deserves.The Ugly: the lighting. I understand that saturating this in a dark, depressing filter would have completely ruined the tone. But, why does the movie have to look like a sitcom for most of it?",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
71,M_Exchange,Bad.,3,20 January 2021,"I know that Riki Lindhome has a sizeable following, but I think that most of us watched this film because we wanted to see Robert Forster's final performance. He didn't disappoint. Lindhome isn't exactly a superb actor, but when she is paired with Jim Cummings she seems like Catherine Keener.As I've stated several times in the past, when your lead actor is horrible it weighs down the entire production, and it's difficult to look beyond him. Cummings has goofy Jim Carrey-like facial expressions during grave scenes, and he often causes you to wonder if some of the film's serious moments are supposedly funny until you realize that it's just bad acting. He says his lines as if he is doing a cold reading and trying to make them seem as spontaneous as possible even though he just read them for the first time one minute earlier. But he wrote the script. So he has been familiar with every line for years. I think that he should have just directed the film and allowed someone else to take the helm.Also, the character he plays is unlikeable. One could make a comedic montage for YouTube from this film in which the main character is just yelling at people, including his own daughter when she almost dies. It's laughable. With few exceptions, when the main character is repulsively unpleasant the audience generally doesn't want to follow him.But I will state that the climax was good, and for me it achieved the proper creepiness and suspense. It's just not worth sitting through more than an hour of mediocrity, though.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

But hey, the joke is on him, he made this turd. If it had been in the same lane or quality as Super Troopers, I would have laughed. But this was a failure imho.Next time I see the name Jim Cummings on a movie (thinking about a porn actor) I will stay away and not spend a cent or any time watching it.All that being said, I'll give it 4/10Because it's actually better than any of the latest Steven Seagal movies!",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

I'm very excited to see what he does next.This movie truly is a horror, dark comedy, mystery drama. That's a lot of genres, but it's so well written and executed perfectly! This movie is FUNNY. I mean, stop the movie because you're cracking up so hard with tears running down your eyes funny. Maybe it's the alcoholism/aa subplot going on... I happen to have extensive personal experience with that stuff. It was so realistically and tastefully done.It's just a great movie. Horror buffs should love it. Drama buffs should love it. Comedy buffs should love it. And the mystery is very well executed. I'm not going to go into details about the plot... it's best to go in with a clean slate.If you got problems with this movie, go see some Hollywood trash feature.

No he interacts as person would who is an actor who can't act, delivering dialog of someone who can't write, following the direction of of someone who can't direct.

Pretty casual yet fresh as frog and well acted. Don't take it seriously and you'll start laughing (hopefully). It doesn't really have a strong atmosphere for a horror movie, that ""horror"" indicator is only because of the plot which isn't that main catch here, it's the protagonist and how he's dealing with stuff.

But I can see how it would not be for everyone, and if you can't accept the deadpan black humor in this ""horror"" film (there is some gore), then just turn it off. It doesn't let up.Some are comparing it to Fargo, or a half dozen other popular movies, but what it calls back to for me is the 1981 camp horror film The Howling with Dee Wallace and Patrick Macnee. Which was the best of the 80's werewolf films, in my opinion.I gave it 8/10, because it is very good and highly entertaining, but so over-the-top that it can't help but alienate a portion of the possible audience.

I'm not understanding how some reviews were so opposed to Jim Cummings performance. I thought it was great, definitely seemingly excessive in the beginning but fit right in and was solid.
I also super enjoyed Riki Lindhome's portrayal of her character. There was something familar about the character, but just can't see to place it. Demetrius Daniels and Skyler Bible were also super great. Even the extra's in the background were good. Some pretty awesome directing there.
What was up with the snowboard instructor look when she's sitting with her students? Right at the camera? It doesn't seem to fit, nor believable that she would go explore the sounds in the forest beside the road. Such an overused cliche in the horror genre. The next scene had me forget all about the silly moment and camped it up greatly with the comical tunes.

112,Jim_Screechy,It's OK,6,11 October 2020,"Its a fairly entertaining film which for the most part I really enjoyed. Its very humorous, whilst not strictly being especially 'comedic' and I think this blends in well with the film in general and what I think it is trying to achieve.It has a great cast and is well acted and directed. There is a lot of suspense and this is placed quite strategically in a well paced plot. Direction is again good and bit for the screen play which lets it down, I think I'd have given it a few more points.The real issue is the story. I'd not heard of the film so when I started watching it I got quite drawn in. 20 minutes in, I thought ""this movie is like someone who's made it has put every idea they ever had into in instead of weeding out the won'ts that don't work"". Well, after looking at the credits, that seems to largely be the truth of it.The failings are with the main character, who is really the main focus of the plot, and whilst its good to have strong focus on a lead, this one over engages in him without really fleshing out the intricacies necessary to convey a true perspective of his character. Too be honest, even if it had, it would still have been a bad idea, the real interest in this tale is in the murders that are taking place, what is going on with regards to the town, the victims, the search for the killer and the suspense, horror and intrigue therein. The focus on the officer Marshall, the thin window into his father's ailing health are inconsequential (for the most part) and are given too much attention. ultimately the film is in need of some serious steamlining.Anyway, I think it still a good film, and Jim Cummings CAN act, but his efforts here are misplaced in many ways since this could have been so much more with a little less.My advise is to watch it and see for yourself, because I think this is going to be one of those films which people will mostly like a lot or totally hate.... mostly. I think 6 is a fair score.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

I like dark comedies that are really just character studies. I'm from Utah (where this was filmed and takes place) and there are lots of small towns similar to this one. They got a few things wrong if they were attempting to be regionally accurate: Utahns don't have southern accents, we don't say y'all, and everyone in those small towns is Mormon, not Catholic. And trust me, they all say prayers at work. But those might have been choices they made on purpose as to make it more relatable. Utah is a strange place and those small towns are even stranger.

But boy, is it worth the ride for the performances, the set pieces... and the cracking dialogue. Rarely have I laughed out loud so much in a movie of this sort - and for all the right reasons.It reminded me in many ways of Oren Uziel's fine 2017 bank heist movie 'Shimmer Lake'.

Containing many allusions to other films (the Silence of Lambs-like climax inspires giggles and goosebumps in equal measure), the film provides a pleasantly entertaining experience. Director, writer, and actor Jim Cummings takes the craft of film making and film history seriously as well as the intricacies of family dynamics and recovery.

There's a hint of Fargo and a sprinkle of X Files all stirred in together to make a great little horror/mystery that had me guessing right up to the brilliant ending.

I think not.This is no masterpiece but let me assure you: speaking as a thriller/horror long-time enthusiast, flicks like these are a real gem.Discover it for yourself.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

I also don't really like mindless and gory horror, or dark ""comedy"" that misses its mark, the former making me queasy, and the latter making me uneasy.
Well I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.
After writing a pretty tight script, with simple plot-points, character driven, decent banter in everyman speak, that gives even minor characters their own identity. Jim then hops up to the director's chair and pulls it all together, whilst also turning in a solid main performance.
Again I must point out... He is playing an unlikeable character... It is not BAD acting... He is portraying an ex-jock, ex-military, alcoholic, divorced deputy in a small town, with an estranged daughter and a stubborn aging father/ boss. He feels his life is passing him by, he's surrounded by incompetent coworkers, overbearing constituents, and is making promises he seemingly can't deliver on... I thought he brought that right to the table steaming hot.
The rest of the cast, particularly Riki and Chloe really assisted in fleshing-out his downward spiral.

This absolutely, definitely, positively not a comedy in any sort of way. I am pretty angry right now, having just this moment finished this mediocre slightly scary drama. I rarely watch new movies. But, I sometimes make an exception when one is labeled as a ""comedy/horror"", as this one was.Anyways, besides what I have just mentioned, it did seem like it might be an okay horror. And, even while watching most of it, I thought that's what I was getting. But, by the end you realize it is basically not even that. It turns out it is basically an extended cop drama with an emphasis on the main guy's mental and home life problems. Puke.Besides all of those weaknesses, the film is pretty watchable and okay.

The plot bounces with accidental comic timing between the story of an unstable, dilettante, alcoholic sheriff and a series of grisly murders. There is no werewolf. Cummings uses a motif of constant shouting and bickering to try and boost poor acting and boring writing. His attempts at misdirection are not suspenseful, but obvious and boring, culminating in a net loss payoff.It's a flub of 'Fargo', a wanting 'Wolfman', a sh_t 'Scooby-Doo', and as dumb as 'The Dead Don't Die'.But it's always great to see Riki Lindhome getting work.

I was wrong, it went much more downhill fast: After those 10 minutes, the music score kicked in and I couldn't place the dialogues anymore. It was like the wrong score was used. It went from bad to worse but still couldn't figure out if it was intentional or not. After seeing this movie listed as comedy, I realized it was just the worst movie score I had ever heard, it may have been somewhat more watchable with better music.Jim Cummings was supposed to be someone with anger issues, performs like a bipolar person but does that in such an amateurish way you can't even distinguish when he switches/switched to play the other guy.Robert Forster is a steady actor when it comes to performance, the only other good performance worth mentioning is the second victim, which says enough.Either I'm too old to get this type of movie/acting, or I need to booze up first.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

The cops making sniping comments and arguing with each other and the lead character's frustration with the lack of progress were initially a bit weird but once I got into it I found it quite funny. Many horror/ comedies descend into farce and the horror element is non existent, not sure I would really call this a horror/comedy as I don't think it really fits into either genre but it manages to keep the central mystery interesting and throw in some humour along the way.

The great Robert Forster stars in possibly the last role before his death as the cops elderly and frail father who also happens to be the Sheriff of the town. It is a horror comedy but in a more dramatic and serious way than many other horror comedies tend to be and I really liked it.

Kind of Fargo meets Twin Peaks meets a werewolf movie. I agree with other reviewers that it's more character study than werewolf movie - but that's not a bad thing in this case. Jim Cummings did a great job IMO - although I can see how some people might not quite ""get"" what I think he was going for. If you consider that he wrote, acted in, and directed this, it's all the more impressive as usually that's a recipe for disaster. There is a ton of subtlety in what's going on and for the people who think that ""Transformers"" is awesome theater, well, they'll probably miss most if not all of it. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the reactions and dialog. If you chuckled your way through a movie like ""The Station Agent"", you'll probably do the same here.There were a few weaknesses in the plot and the character arcs could have been better, but overall, I enjoyed this enough to watch it twice ... which almost never happens.Production values are good, acting is pretty strong, it's not awash in political agendas or wokeness, so, worth a watch.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

174,helanren88,Quirky but not bad,7,5 July 2021,"The flow of the movie is definitely different from your average mystery horror thriller. It's listed as a comedy but the comedy comes mostly from the quirkiness of the small town characters and, like other reviewers have said, feels Fargo-esque.Normally the flow of the movie would have annoyed me, but combined with the backstory of the main character it makes sense and it does set it apart from other movies in the genre.It's not all good though. To be perfectly honest I am not a fan of Jim Cummings as an actor. I like the different approach to the movie and see him listed as writer and director, so he's plenty talented. Just get a different lead for the next movie. Going back to Fargo, a perfect lead for a movie like this would've been a Martin Freeman-type who has good deadpan comedy qualities.Ultimately the storyline and its resolution isn't very interesting and takes a backseat to the form, but the ride itself was still enjoyable. I do hope to see more movies from Jim Cummings, just not with him in a lead role.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

It is a really interesting horror flick.The only downside to the movie is the lead actor Jim Cummings. This guy makes everything painful.

In case you didn't know, he directed it, wrote in it, and despite having a more famous actor in this get's top billing as ACTING in it too. Any professional in film knows not to give yourself so many top credits like that or put yourself first because it makes you look inexperienced and vane.The film itself is fine - it's got great cinematography for a low budget film.

The writing needed work, as the story misfired and meandered, defied logic, and had a random reveal that seemed to have little to do with the investigation/clues that had preceded it. The acting was great, with one exception: Jim Cummings, who destroyed every scene he was in - I can't tell if that is the way he normally acts, or if it was a choice, but it was bad. Other reviewers have mentioned comedy, but I found absolutely none (not that I needed any). I'm a werewolf movie fan, and this could have been so good (every attack scene was great). To the reviewer that asked that no more werewolf movies ever be made - that's just daft; you may as well say to never again make a vampire movie, or a drama, or a comedy, or a horror, or a movie about a hit-man, etc. Bring on more werewolf movies - just make them a better.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

Dialogue could use a sharper sword in places, and ditch the cliche ""about to retire"" foolishness.

One review hit it right on the head...Fargo meets X Files with a dash of David Lynch. In my eyes the over the top antics of Cummings was representative of an individual suffering from past addictions and unable to properly handle the calling of being the Sheriff. I sensed ,at times,a dark humor,but it did not take away from the overall horror aspect of the storyline. While Cummings acting turned off a good many watchers... I found him fascinating...Add to that an excellent supporting cast. MORE!!!!",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
191,abraxis0,Certainly the best werewolf movie made in the last decade,6,1 February 2021,"While not a masterpiece this is a movie I'd recommend giving a view. I can't see myself choosing to watch it again with friends who haven't seen it yet. There's better movies. But that said, this movie isn't bad.The main protagonist was a little over the top but still fun to watch. There were abandonment issues and living with terrible choices themes that gave the story an emotional buy-in that was semi-effective but never really realized. The secondary characters and cast are relatable & have lives of their own. There not just prop pieces. So a really good cast and well shot.Certain base line assumptions this movie asks you to make, for example the town's attitude towards the police solving a crime immediately after it's occurred then turning on them when that doesn't happen the next day, is a little hard to go along with the way it was presented. This aspect of the movie felt like a real misfire, because the main protagonist was deeply motivated by approval and the town was turning on his department due to their being unable to solve the horrific murders.It's an imperfect movie that even though flawed is still worth your consideration. So if you're wondering whether to watch Hereditary for the seventh time or watch something new, this is not a bad choice.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

It really was a unique film, and I've seen a gazillion horror/thriller movies. So to review this movie like it's a standard B horror is ridiculous.

I feel compelled to say ignore them and watch it for yourself. Some people point out that the reason they don't like it is because of the main character and also the fact that it is not an obvious horror movie. I would agree it is not really a horror movie, it is a more of a character based story.You are not supposed to like the main guy, he is supposed to be annoying because of his inadequacies and that is the whole point of the movie and it is what they focus on the most. I actually really enjoyed the movie because I did not know what was going to happen next, it was intriguing. People mention that the clues etc don't really stack up, that is also the point, they were out of their depth and barely have to investigate murders and so were bumbling around making a mess of the investigation.Overall it was shot well with good quality effects, nice scenery, you really get a feel for the small town location. I also really liked the focus on the characters themselves, I felt like I knew a lot about the main character once the movie ended.

196,terrextv,One of the dumbest movies I've seen in a long tme.,2,7 January 2021,"Shouting every line in the Adam Sandler brand of comedy seldom works, even for Adam Sandler. Here, it just grates on your nerves and adds absolutely nothing to an already flimsy story. The Wolf of Snow Hollow is a disgustingly stupid way to spend a couple of hours.
The film follows a ski town's police force as they investigate a series of grisly murders. Its main character is an unlikable idiot, and the secondary plotlines to reveal his humanity are wafer-thin caricatures that make him even less likable. The cop dad-with-rebellious kid trope shoehorned in here has been overdone and stinks of unimaginative writing.
Then, there are his absolutely fantastical deductions, such as accurately declaring a missing strip of pelt on an animal carcass could only have been removed because of a bloody handprint. He has ridiculous outbursts at regular intervals that are supposed to be funny, some complete with idiotic slapfights.
Often, there is little rhyme or reason behind his and many of the other characters' actions. Its depiction of the rural locals is the typical condescendingly elitist silliness we have come to expect of Hollywood's lazy and tired brand of writing. The final deduction of the killer's identity is so forced and ridiculously contrived that it seems to be imagined by a child.
I can't believe I sat through this drivel. Ignore the pretentious reviews that give this undeserving movie a high score. Save yourself a heap of eye-rolling and frustration and don't spend a cent to have the stupidity unfold before your eyes.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

My only really problem with the movie was that it's tonal shifts were just all over the place.

The story is garbled. There are a lot of things that aren't explained and the film doesn't seem to know if it's a cop story about catching a werewolf or a drunk struggling to handle life's pressures.

The below may have some spoiler. In the end scene, the killer has the lead's throat and then for some reason leaves him and starts to run and then gets shot by the lead. Why don't he kill the lead? And the killer looks a mere caricature. And that father-daughter relationship was meant to be emotional? It was nothing but.

Over the course of several full moons, a bunch of young women are brutally murdered in the otherwise quiet town of Snow Hollow by what appears to be a large wolf. One misfit cop is on the case, determined to prove that the killer is nothing more than a man.It's hard to say whether or not I liked this movie. When it impressed me, it REALLY impressed me. But everything in between left me with a big hairball of ""Meh.""THE GOODEST STUFF:
Practical werewolf effects win every time. Hands down. And so it is for true fans of the genre that I shout an emphatic: ""WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!"" ""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"" has the best practical werewolf effects I've seen in recent years. Nothing since ""Dog Soldiers"" has looked this good. The gore effects are impressive and the movie's overall visual style is fittingly mysterious, bleak, and visceral.THE NON-GOODEST STUFF:
As other reviews have pointed out, this movie is a tonal mess. When it commits to being a horror movie it's fantastic, but, unfortunately, it treats those moments of horror as setups for a sitcom-esque punchline that never comes. The brutal deaths of young women are handled flippantly and with little remorse. Even the main characters don't seem to carry the full weight of the trauma in a realistic way. The movie tries to walk the fine line between horror and comedy, but I just didn't find anything funny about it.As usual in a movie like this, you've got a cast of characters that never make very good decisions. (Why in the name of all Americans in London would you get out of your car on a dark snowy road to investigate a dead animal while you have a baby in the backseat? I grew up in rural New England. Nobody I knew ever made it a practice to walk up to large roadkill, especially not at night when there are reports of a humongous killer wolf roaming about. Jeeze!) But maybe these moments were part of the horror/comedy vibe the movie was going for.The ending, too, was ultimately a letdown, but I can't say why without getting into spoilers. Let me just say that if someone served you a bowl of wolf meat stew but didn't actually put any wolf meat in it, would you be disappointed? ... Yes? .... Ok, then you probably won't like the ending either.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

All is good about the movie, snowy sceneries are perfect background for the story, action scenes are fine, including interesting way of mixing fragments from the ""after attack"" and ""attack"" scenes together. Good acting of all actors and non-trivial story and the action finish.
Yet there's one thing about the movie which makes it exceptional (positive or negative way...?) and this is the performance of Jim Cummings himself.

However his capacity to show emotion is unrivaled by hardly any male actor out there today- again, my opinion. This intensity combined with his realistic refelction of a confused male dealing with things like ego, loss, connection, etc. ring so true that it felt like I was legitimately watching this guy go through this in his actual life.I have seen both films more than once now and eagerly wait his third title.

Boom! That was well done in its writing shooting, editing, and the pacing of everything, was wonderful, the jokes came a mile a minute and I do wish it had been longer and a few little things explained that weren't but hell I'm ok without it. It's done as a mystery and done well. I agree with what someone noted earlier about the juxtaposition of his Jim's wolfen attributes fit nicely and nailed the feeling of dealing with sobriety and what that does cause a person to be like. Been there and know it well. I also know the feeling of a bunch of people talking at me all at the same time and that was on the money, though the people doing that to me where more like synchronized cannibals of the mind dissecting me, but anyhow, I survived and am I'm surviving. Now back to the film it glides from drama, comedy, thriller, horror as a mystery like a slow coiling of rope on a well, the audience in the bucket getting closer to the top and then like a flickering light of continual lighting strikes it shuffles those themes again, quicker never letting you stay in those themes, like a former all night, all day drinker moving into drunkenness' super quick after having been sober for a while was on the money. Sad Reality but Well Done! When he broke the stove door it was laugh and cry in a split second.

Massive Cheers! and tears for the master of his craft Robert Forester! Thanks Dan Harmon for bring it up and sending people it's way! I'm going to do the same. I'm also going to definitely watch it again because there was so much that happened even though it was short for the most part, but tightly knit.

It's a horror/thriller/fantasy film mixed with comedy that hits at just the right moment. The movie is very entertaining and Jim Cummings throws the punch lines right on target. I couldn't wait for him to smart off to the next person in his path because it was hilarious and had me lolololing all the way to the end. Plus it took the edge off the movie's scary parts.

There are a lot of complaints that the main character is over the top, and I felt that way at first as well, but I came to realize that the guy is really on the verge of losing it, even before the events of the movie, and those events push him past that.

216,greencrest,Fresh Meat,9,8 November 2020,"Jim Cummings follows up his excellent debut Thunder Road with The Wolf of Snow Hollow.Here, as in Thunder Road, Cummings plays a police officer trying to cope with both his job and his familial duties, and in both he excels at portraying a man whose nerves are never very far from the surface, often boiling over to either dramatic or comedic effect (often in the same scene). Cummings' performance is astonishing, moving with ease from high emotion to slapstick to a glacial stillness, carrying the viewer along for the ride. He's ably supported by an excellent cast, all of whom impress throughout, though special mention must go to Riki Lindhome and the late Robert Forster for some brilliantly detailed work.Comparison has been made with Fargo, and although I can't deny the two films do share a similar sensibility and setting, I find The Wolf of Snow Hollow to be the stronger film. Though Fargo has many admirers, for me it often feels like caricature. Cummings' seems able to create characters who feel as if they have a life beyond the edge of the frame, and don't merely exist to populate a thumbnail sketch of small-town oddity.There's a freshness to Cummings' direction too; some of the shots are breathtaking, occasionally making use of a staccato visual grammar that might be expected in arthouse but is unusual in a film that presents itself as accessible entertainment, first and foremost. There's no pretentiousness on display - the shots always service the intent of the script, it's just that it's done with such a flair that it really makes you sit up and take notice.The Wolf of Snow Hollow can be many things to many viewers - a rollercoaster horror/comedy, a serial thriller, a commentary on the relationship between the sexes, a portrait of workplace and family or all of the above. Whatever it is, it's another demonstration that Cummings is a major talent.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

I think it hit on most of the big ticks up until then and I was really impressed with the human story being told in the horror setting and thought this was going to be a unique film but instead the ending fell flat in my opinion. The reveal *spoilers ahead* that despite everything we'd been shown that the ""monster"" was just a dude in a costume felt like a huge misstep. It went from being a very human story set in a horror setting to just another crime movie. Felt like a huge missed opportunity to me.

The music didn't match the movie at times and went on for way to long. The main actor couldn't act, sounded like he was reading from a script the whole time. Sad to see from someone with so many accreditation. The way he acted and the music I expected this movie to have a rating in the high 5s, if they would have fixed those two issues I could have seen this in the high 6s.

The vistas were awesome, it was creepy and mysterious and I would have loved it if not for the lead actor, Jim Cummings.I was expecting horror, but then wondered I was wrong and it was really supposed to be a spoof or comedy. Every scene Mr. Cumming is in, he's screaming, attacking someone out of the blue, crying, or getting drunk. He's full of self-pity and on the verge of hysteria all the time. I couldn't imagine a police force keeping someone so unstable on since he has zero self-control, ever.But I enjoyed the other performances quit a lot, especially that of Riki Lindhome as Detective Robson and did like the deliberate bits of humour.

230,greenlanternspacesector2814,This Writer-Director Definitely Has A Promising Cinematic Future.,9,20 April 2021,"Jim Cummings is the next Coen Brothers or Sam Raimi. Marvel should tap this guy to do something for them quick. I had no idea of what to expect from this movie. Just turned it on in the middle and was hooked immediately. I ended up watching it again from the beginning right after I finished it. Cummings immediately shows his skill and idiosyncratic style in the way that he edits, playing clever temporal tricks with the narrative that make it look like past and present moments are happening at the same time. It creates a trippy, original quality to the storytelling. Some people criticize Cummings as an actor but I think he's fantastic. He reminds me of Bruce Campbell in that he simultaneously portrays a parody of macho masculinity while also presenting a credible example of it. In other words, he manages to be both an action hero and a spoof of an action hero at the same time.Equally impressive is his depiction of small town life. It rivals Lynch and the Coens for being both credibly realistic and weirdly eccentric. Cummings rides that fine line between slapstick comic and graphically jarring, executing both with tremendous craft. I look forward to his next movie. I hope he continues to work with genre material because he's every bit as fun as Sam Raimi or James Gunn. Good luck Jim, you've made a fan in me.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

287,ambiguoustuma,Just didn't like him,5,8 May 2021,Jim Cummings made this hard to watch - I don't really know what else to add beyond this. Honestly I want to write more... but he's just brutal.,The Wolf of Snow Hollow
288,wilsoe-72365,"People, it's a comedy",8,3 January 2021,I think the people that gave this movie bad reviews took it far too seriously... its a satirical comedy and it was occasionally hilarious.,The Wolf of Snow Hollow
289,Chris_G_Parsons,Thinks it's way more clever than it actually is.,3,10 October 2020,"This film tries so hard to come off as quirky, but the humor falls flat like 95% of the time. It still gave me a couple of chuckles, mainly from the late, great Robert Forster who is effortlessly amazing, but the editing and performances otherwise are nothing that will stand the test of time. I saw one reviewer saying it's like ""Fargo with a Werewolf"", and the truth is the film WANTS to be Fargo but it's MILES and MILES away from the greatness of that film. It's like Fargo for Dummies. That being said, it's very difficult to write, direct and star in a full length feature film, so I have to give Cummings credit for that, but the film itself didn't do much for me.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

299,darkandahalf,Conflicted about this movie.,6,15 October 2020,"First, let me start by saying I am a HUGE fan of werewolves & werewolf stories are my favourite horror sub-genre, movies or books.
About ninety percent of werewolf movies that are made are just downright embarrassing & is why good production money for lycanthrope movies always get passed over for the countless, garbage vampire & zombie films that seem to be an automatic green light. One of the reasons for this is because it's so hard to get the most important thing right, the werewolf. Well, it shouldn't be that hard with all the CG wizardry available today but these film makers don't have the passion for these creatures to give them the showing they deserve. And practical effects seem to have strangely gotten worse over time since American Werewolf in London. But this movie nailed it. I really wasn't expecting the werewolf to look any good. Disappointment was almost guaranteed whenever I sat down to watch a werewolf flick. But the first time they showed the werewolf in its full glory after it had just ripped the woman's arm off, I literally jumped off my couch & gasped. It was beautiful! I hadn't had excitement like this since the Underworld movies & more recently Howl in 2015. The second time they showed the beast was even better. It was huge, muscular & menacing without the usual token roar whenever a monster is introduced in movies. It just stood there in all its into intimidating glory, just staring. It was what it should be, scary as hell. Not just some overgrown guy in a suit looking like a rabid Wookie. (I'm looking at you Late Phases)
And this is why I'm so conflicted with this movie. Because someone finally got the werewolf right, but it wasn't a werewolf at all. Forget that even though the ending doesn't explain how this terrifying, realistic looking creature, standing on digitagrade legs, ripping people's limbs off is actually just a man in a suit. If this WAS a real werewolf movie, it would have easily been one of the best ones to come out in years. Instead they decided to go for a Scooby Doo style ""twist"" & now a movie that up until the last 15 minutes I thought was going to be one of my favourite werewolf movies became just another run of the mill who dunnit. It had everything going for it, good acting, good directing, fantastic looking creature & then they just threw it away. Deflating.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
300,dragatis-52542,No idea where this was supposed to go.,4,24 November 2020,"This movie stumbles around like somebody wrote three different stories, and got the pages mixed up. It could have been a good werewolf horror, or a funny comedy horror, I can't tell which it was though. Jim Cummings was difficult to watch because you couldn't tell if his character was supposed to be funny or serious, because he was neither. His acting, and the jumbled, undeveloped side stories, distracted me from the actual main storyline. Not worth the time.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
301,wnickni,Indescribably bad,1,10 October 2020,"Acting, story, directing... everything just horrible. Had high hopes but every second that Cummings is on screen is pure torture.The entire movie is so bad it inspired me to write my first review haha",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
302,captain-kidd,What a train wreck,1,8 November 2020,"Bad writing, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing. There's absolutely nothing exciting about this movie, even though the trailer seems to suggest otherwise.No one talks or behaves the way these characters do. Oftentimes something completely random happens for no logical reason whatsoever, like a grown man losing a tooth. If you view it as a comedy, you might be able to sit through it, but that doesn't mean you should.This movie cost me 7 dollars. You know what else I could've done with 7 dollars? Literally anything else.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
303,amislifkin,A fresh take,8,10 November 2021,"Initially I had no expectations of this film not knowing anyone behind it. But when I watched I was astounded that it was: written, directed, and acted by Jim Cummings. This movie is a dark comedy horror hybrid so expect so not so seamless tonal shifting ,but overall I think it works. Even more so on the second viewing there's a lot of subtle Easter eggs.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

308,dakotadeck,Should have been a real werewolf!!,1,10 October 2020,What a solid movie until the end. I'm the biggest werewolf fan and good movies don't come around often. The movie had me drawn in and on the edge of my seat through the attack scenes and at the end when he was in the taxidermy office. Literally all that needed to happen was for the taxidermist to change into a real werewolf since it showed a real werewolf through the attack scenes it's eyes even glowed. But then it's going to show this guy with a cheap costume on halfway and doesn't even have the head piece on smh! I had my faith restored in another good werewolf movie this day in time but was crushed at the end of this movie! Don't make a werewolf movie without a real werewolf!!!,The Wolf of Snow Hollow

If you go into this movie hoping for a supernatural monster, you'll be disappointed.The movie also had plot holes and the false leads only made the movie more disjointed. Some of acting felt forced or like the characters were trying too hard. I couldn't find a synopsis for this movie and really only had a few reviews and the trailer to go off of. If you're hoping for a werewolf horror movie, look elsewhere.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
318,dreameroutoftouch,It's bad,1,21 March 2021,"This is a really bad movie. My first hint was the opening scene, but unfortunately I had already paid six dollars so I had to finish the movie or it would have been an even more of a waste.Jim Cummings is a bad actor. It seemed like he was trying to do a Jim Carry approach to a horror movie, which left the movie in a sort of limbo where it was not funny nor scary.Maybe the first screaming scene was tolerable but then it never stopped. It was like a feature length temper tantrumThe writing didn't even make sense and the cinematography was grade school at best.I cannot stand directors whose egos are overblown enough not only to direct and write but also star in their own movie - which Jim Cummings did an abysmal job at.It's a lazy, confusing, over dramatic, pathetic, waste of time. Do yourself a favor and watch literally anything else.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
319,jamisonryon,Amazing film,10,1 October 2021,"After watching thunder road I thought to myself that I needed to see this, and after watching this movie it made me think that the only reason thunder road was a 9/10 was because it didn't have a werewolf.

321,Punkinberry,Pleasant surprise,10,11 April 2021,"I can tell this is going to be one of those movies I rewatch several times. It's extremely funny, intelligent without sacrificing the horror/thriller aspect. I think some viewers misunderstood the main character, as several reviews complain that all he does is yell/overact, but that was purposely done to show just how stressed out he is! He's on the verge of a nervous breakdown & an alcoholic!I had never heard of Jim Cummings but he earned a new fan! To those on the fence, this movie is free on Prime now so it's certainly worth giving a shot.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
322,stainowsky37,So Good,9,27 May 2021,"These reviews are all hilarious. Someone said they didnt like the lead because of 'all the yelling' hahaha. Adam Sandler does a lot of yelling and it's great every single time.Jim Cummings has done a great job as a filmmaker.Only 9/10 because I thought the script should've been tighter at the end. I was excited for a werewolf film but once it splintered off into alcoholism it got a little too insular, whereas I loved the shared scenes with idiot villagers. I also thought there was going to be a bit of a Lynch-ian lilt as thats what the opening seemed to hint towards (Twin Peaks).Its hard to do absurd and this film is very quick witted.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
323,markaspin,Jim please pack in the acting.,4,10 October 2020,"Direction was great. The story was great. Jim's acting was really bad. I'm beginning to think he sent himself the wrong script instead he sent a comedy script. His acting stands out like a sore thumb. He should have sack his acting self day one.

324,alexander_svensson85,What a joke!,4,31 October 2021,"This is far from a good movie. Its listed as comedy but there is none of it and i love dark humor. The ""high core"" here on imdb is probably because there is a lot of fake users and review.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

327,deranged_doodles,A werewolf movie that isn't.,4,23 January 2021,"Very rarely is there such a good thing as a great werewolf movie anymore. Seems like it would be an easy concept to pull off, but all recent attempts seem to fall flat...this movie is no exception. The characters are not likable and the actors seem to come across as amateur, especially Jim Cummings; Robert Forster and Will Madden are the only exception to that. The story seems to not really go anywhere and is very basic. I'll save the time of watching it and just tell you it's about a sheriff deputy slowly becoming more (predicably) unraveled while also being inept at solving...yawn...boring murders. More frustrating is the climax that only fires on 3 of 8 cylinders... and no reason for the killings is ever explained. Very disappointed at ""the reveal"" of the killer (or ""what"" is doing the killing). Watch this if you feel like you must, otherwise pass it on by.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

I was expecting more, maybe that was my problem.
I think I went in with too high of expectations. It could've been a pretty decent movie if they had just spent some more time on the plot. And maybe some more time on the script. And maybe just a little bit more time filling out the characters. Other than that it was OK. Just thankful it was marked down to $1.99....",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
332,demitris_b,Confused,2,15 September 2021,I'm honestly confused and wonder what the appeal of this movie is? The acting was so cringey that I had to stop it a couple times and will myself to continue. The only reason I willed myself on was because I thought it would make sense and get good by the end based on the majority of reviews I've seen. But man was this movie horrible in its acting quality. I wonder if it's some kind of joke to say it was any good?,The Wolf of Snow Hollow
333,hessenthaler-83992,Weird movie...,1,27 December 2020,"There is no plot to this movie, it's all over the place. From one scene to the next, they don't make sense.

334,sambrown-76880,Big let down,3,25 February 2021,Trailer was intriguing but as the show developed I couldn't tell if it was a comedy or actual movie . It ended up corny to me,The Wolf of Snow Hollow
335,natalia-66477,Could have been great,6,12 October 2020,"What a strange movie. It tackles so many topics which, if explored deeeper, could have resulted in a smart piece with social commentary. A fragile masculinity unable to fulfill expectations, misogyny resulting in horrible deaths, effects of family bonds being broken, men grappling with emotions, father-son relationship, father-daughter relationship, fighting with addiction, peoples mistrust towards the police; even origins of werewolf lore. Had one or two of these topics been explored and deepened, the film would be soo much better and smarter. But it tries to be everything at once instead, resulting in a convoluted mess with unfulfilling ending.
I liked the camerwork, there were some beautiful shots of snowy landscapes. That's definitely one of the highlights.
I see a lot of reviews criticizing Jim Cumming's acting. I liked it, I think he showed an absurd, unhinged and pathetic man that cannot deal with reality quite right, and I definitely saw a lot of comedy there. It's a pity that the movie never decides what to do with his character, doesn't give him a proper redemption arc apart from one scene where he admits he's a jerk, or a proper closure (saying goodbye on a cemetery and passing a sheriff's star to a person who - thankfully! - got it at the end would have been a nice wrap up.)A total wasted potential. Nevertheless, I had quite a good time, not expecting much.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow

The genres it's listed as are actually all of my favorite genres, and I love it when people mix them together effectively. This movie had fun aspects from all of these genres, but all in all, I'd say it's actually more of a character study than a mystery or a horror film, so people who are only watching it for those things are going to be disappointed. It's very well crafted. It doesn't beat the audience over the head with what it's trying to say so you have to pay close attention. Also, Jim Cummings is hilarious and his comedic timing kills me.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
340,osseous-30530,The Wolf(s),8,13 July 2021,"Excellent dark comedy. It's a little slow at first, but that is only to build up the tension and realization that there are two wolves in this movie. The first and most obvious, is the killer. The wolfman. The second wolf, which remains unseen until the final scene,... is the sheriff himself. A struggling alcoholic who relapses, and struggles throughout the film fighting a losing battle against the stress of his life and his unchecked anger; culminating with the 'wolf' coming out in the final battle. Excellent cinematography,.. you almost see his canine's through the lighting on his face as he smiles.... at the end.... lol.Remember:""Even a man who is pure in heart,
And says his prayers by night,
May become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms,
And the moon is full and bright.""",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
341,damonkrane,"Superbly crafted, self-critical werewolf movie about toxic masculinity",10,30 October 2020,"This movie is amazing. It's a superbly crafted, surprisingly serious horror-comedy about men grappling with toxic masculinity. It's also a self-critical werewolf movie. And no, the combination of those things doesn't play out as you might expect.It's not Scream. It's not Cabin in the Woods. It's not Tucker & Dale versus Evil. All of which were fine in their own ways, but also extremely heavy-handed about their novelty of being ""meta."" Rather than a film that's obsessed with trying to impress everyone with how clever it is, The Wolf is just a very clever film.What's more, The Wolf isn't a Hollywood piece of crap that tries to maximize commercial success by playing both sides of the fence at the same time -- an approach previously ridiculed by none other than the film's supporting actress Riki Lindhome in her other career as half of comedy music duo Garfunkle and Oats (see ""Both Sides Can Laugh""). So no, this isn't a horror film that invites anyone to identify with the villain so they can satisfy sadistic, misogynistic fantasies. In fact, it's a film that tells you you're pathetic if that's what's brought you to horror in the first place.But when it comes to the flawed central character struggling to be better and some other male characters, the film doesn't give us demeaning caricatures. It presents these men with depth and compassion, encouraging us to laugh at them as we might laugh at ourselves.Consequently, a lot of people will either hate this film or miss its point entirely. Admittedly, I set my expectations way too low on the first viewing (because werewolf movie), and had to rewatch it once I realized what it was really about. But at least even the haters won't come away from this movie idolizing the next Tony Montana, Freddy Krueger or Big Bad Wolf.Jim Cummings seems to have executed a clear creative vision here pretty much flawlessly as the film's writer, director and lead actor. Riki Lindhome and Jimmy Tatro (American Vandal, Season 1) are perfectly cast and great in this, too -- as is Robert Forster (Breaking Bad, Alligator) in what I assume was his final role.I can't recommend this movie enough.",The Wolf of Snow Hollow
